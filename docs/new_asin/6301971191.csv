396766,4,6301971191,Very enjoyable movie that easily deserves to be added to your home collection.  Kirk Douglas underscores his brilliant acting talent to convince the audience of Vincent's lifelong struggles regarding his passion for painting.  Outstanding quality VHS coupled with immediate shipment from Amazon made this inexpensive purchase most satisfying.,1025568000,4,342,6.104166666666667
396767,4,6301971191,"I would wager that this is really the best work Vincente Minnelli ever did, in spite of his reputation as the famous director of MGM Judy Garland musicals. ""Lust for Life"" has a power and pathos to it that is seldom matched in biographical movies. The story of Vincent Van Gogh's struggle to paint and find companionship is beautifully brought to life here. And of course, that is due to superstar Kirk Douglas' intensity as the tortured artist. The scenes he plays with Anthony Quinn's Paul Gaugin are so touching, as even Gaugin (a very hard person) must acknowledge how sad Vincent's longing for a friend is. Highlighting the film also are the color depictions of many of Van Gogh's canvases, raw in color and emotion, a testament to a man who didn't know how to do anything by halves, but gave his whole heart and soul to everything he did and everyone he loved, whether reciprocated or not.",997056000,15,895,4.635220125786163
396768,5,6301971191,"I loved this movie!!  The tragic, misunderstood life of VINCENT VAN GOUGH is given a chance for sympathy and understanding in this adaptation.  Kirk Douglas gives an exemplary, very much believable performance as the whimiscal, at times child-like personality of VINCENT.  Anthony Quinn gives Paul Gaughin's character a ""larger than life"" illusion. And although I am not as familiar with Gaughin's life, the chemistry  between these two actors was nothing short of magnificent.  This is definitely one for the classics library!!",994809600,4,528,5.469135802469136
396769,5,6301971191,"I was blown away and surprised I'd never heard of ""Lust For Life"" until It was recommended to me by someone. ""Lust For Life""`s main points are acting and cinematography. Kirk Douglas gives a haunting performance as Van Gogh which may arguably be one of his best performance on film. Kirl Douglas looks exactly like Van Gogh and his intensity gave me goosebumps. Anthony Quinn also gives a very good performance. In fact all the acting in the film is flawless. The second part of the film that is spectacular is the cinematography. The scenery of the film tries to recreate Van Gogh's paintings and it's beautiful to watch. Some people may complain that you get a watered down version of Van Gogh's life but who cares? The film makes up for that plus you must keep in mind when this film was made. Overall one of the best films I've rented in years and I hope it goes to DVD soon.",980208000,11,879,4.432098765432099
396770,4,6301971191,"Great acting really makes this film ,and reproductions of his works make it a must see. It was not easy to handle a project like this since VINCENT was mostly a mystical and troubled man who had no control over his passion, but that's the reason he was a master painter. This was not the usual HOLLYWOOD product of the fifties, because it's aim was not to absolutely entertain you, but to tell the story the way it should be. An important biographical movie. All those responsable should get A+ for trying.",972777600,4,506,4.510869565217392
396771,5,6301971191,"I've seen this movie many times since I was young, but it always seem like I'm seeing it for the first time. Kirk Douglas is magnificent as the tortured Vincent, full of passion and pain. He is very convincing  throughout the entire film. It's amazing that, back in 1956, a film that  lasted 2 hours made every moment relevant. Today, many films that last 2  hours are just plain boring. The music was just beautiful, and it enhanced  his paintings and segments of life. Anthony Quinn, as Gaugain, was good,  but I think Kirk Douglas should have won an award. There's so much tension  in his character, and so much sadness and desparation in his character. You  really grow to love him despite his failings. His brother Theo was  admirable in his devotion to Vincent. This film is one that can be seen by  everyone, regardless of age, as a memorial to an artist who struggled  despite the tragic outcome.",962150400,13,904,4.59375
396772,4,6301971191,"The movie stands out ever since I seen it as a kid on tv. Would be something to see in an actual theater. The photography is like his paintings- like them or not, they are vivid and memorable. Saw one of his  paintings in a San Francisco gallery 40 years ago. I was very young and  very bored. Took a half hour just to get to the Van Gogh, a small painting  of an orchard. But it was luminous... I still remeber the glow, and not  being able to view it as long as I would have liked. Probably what Van Gogh  wanted. My only other familiarity is pictures of his paintings and the  movie. The movie is impassioned, and Kirk Douglas LOOKS insane in the cafe  while a big celebration is going on in the streets. Nice musical score. A  little too dramatic musically on self-infliction scenes, but that is how  they made movies then. A modern quality remake might let a scene speak for  itself. Good movie for artistic temperaments. Some books on his life might  be interesting",953683200,3,971,4.338888888888889
396773,5,6301971191,"OK, so it's a little goofy in a few scenes, but Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh!  Come on!  What more do you need? He takes the idea of a ""passionate artist"" to an entirely new level. He attacks his  easels the same way he charges out of that trench in Kubrick's Paths of  Glory. I mean, he just paints the HECK out his canvases. I think the gaudy  Technicolor is an interesting juxtoposition with Van Gogh's own emphasis on  bright colors.",943315200,,433,4.283950617283951
396774,3,6301971191,"Many people consider this to be the standard when it comes to retelling the tragic story of Vincent van Gogh's life.
The film is very good and there's no question that director Vincente Minnelli put a tremendous amount  of work into bringing Van Gogh to the screen.  The sets and costumes are  wonderful.
I suppose that my main criticism of the film is that its  ""heart"" seems to be more firmly set in 1950's Hollywood than in  1880's Europe.  In other words, the film has a very constructed, American  flavour to it.  This is most glaring when many of the scenes shift from  Kirk Douglas on the screen (clearly American) to a narrative reading of his  letters to his brother, Theo (read by a British narrator)--very jarring.  Kirk's performance, though very good, never quite ""clinches"" the  role--he remains a very good actor on a very pretty set.
But certainly I  would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in Van Gogh--not a  perfect movie by any means, but there are moments that are quite  remarkable.",922924800,31,1017,4.698863636363637

Such hammy over-acting and an unbearable presentation of the painter as a rabid bipolar (which he may well have been).  Couldn't get past the 1st half hour.

397118,5,6301971191,"Kirk Douglas' finest performance, is fraught with peril. Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin, is superb. The script, some of which was taken from Van Gogh himself, is sometimes dated but always poignant: ""Sometimes the pictures come to me as if in a dream, with a terrible lucidity."" BRILLIANT!!

397152,5,6301971191,"As far as bio-pics go, Lust For Life is one of the best. Kirk Douglas was superb in his portrayal (and guttural groaning) of the tormented Dutch artist.

They used the original art for the movie as well so short of spending the day at the Van Gogh in Amsterdam, a great way to see some of his most famous pieces.  Scary though that they were allowed to be handled the way they were.

397507,4,6301971191,"Based on the Irving Stone novel, which was more a fictionalized account of Van Gogh's life than a biography, nevertheless ""Lust For Life"" is more or less true to the facts of the painter's life.  Beginning when he was around 25, when in his ""religious"" phase he briefly worked as a missionary in the Borinage, an impoverished coal mining region in Belgium, the film follows Van Gogh over the next decade or so until his death.  We see his obsessed pursuit of his cousin Kee Vos, his brief romance with Sien Hoornik (inexplicably named here ""Christine""), his move to Arles in the south of France and his violent association with Gauguin, followed by madness, institutionalization, and death.  Above all, his relationship with his brother Theo, his patron and closest friend, is presented clearly and in detail.

The film is fairly accurate, presenting the details of Van Gogh's life as they were known at the time.  One glaring inaccuracy was the ending - ""Wheat Field With Crows"" was not his last painting, and certainly was not what he was working on when he shot himself, or was shot, depending on whether you accept the theory proffered in Gregory White and Steven Naifeh's masterful biography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Gogh-The-Life/dp/0375758976/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Gogh: The Life</a>.  Van Gogh left no suicide note, and his easel along with whatever painting he was working on at the time, not to mention the revolver belonging to local innkeeper Gustave Ravoux were never found, after he staggered back to Auvers with his fatal wound.  Interestingly, this film indirectly led to White and Naifeh developing the theory that Van Gogh was actually shot by Ren Secrtan, a local teenager.  After the film was released, Secrtan (by then middle aged) reportedly was so disturbed by the portrayal of the unattractive Van Gogh by the dashing Kirk Douglas, that he inadvertently revealed information that suggested he was the shooter, and Van Gogh, who may in fact have been suicidally despondent, may have decided to protect him by claiming that he had shot himself.

This speculation of course has no place in the film, nor does the theory put forth by Hans Kaufman and Rita Wildegans in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Goghs-Ohr-Paul-Gauguin-und-der-Pakt-des-Schweigens/dp/3940731145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Goghs Ohr:  Paul Gauguin und der Pakt des Schweigens</a>, that it was Gauguin who accidentally cut off Van Gogh's ear when the painter surprised him on the street after Gauguin had left the ""Yellow House"" following a bitter argument.  Instead, the film conveys Van Gogh's personal torment, his loneliness, his inability to connect with people and maintain relationships, and how he still remained true to his artistic vision despite the constant setbacks and unhappiness of his life.  For those interested in the man behind the popular paintings that have become virtual icons, ""Lust For Life"" is a great introduction.",1428624000,3,3045,5.538793103448276

Having said that, the film also gets other details wrong.  First, Van Gogh actually attended seminary, but dropped out, proclaiming that Greek and Latin wouldn't help him minister.  He did not cut off his ear.  Rather, he mangled it.  But a major detail is that he had a brother who was exactly one year older than him, who was still-born.

397582,5,6301971191,"LUST FOR LIFE [1956] [Blu-ray] High-Voltage Acting! Kirk Douglas Finest Performance!

Vibrant orange sunflowers. Rippling yellow grain. Trees bursting with white bloom. The pictures come to me as in a dream, Vincent van Gogh said. A dream that too often turned to life-shattering nightmare. Winner of the Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics Best Actor Awards, Kirk Douglas gives a fierce portrayal as the artist torn between the joyous inspiration of his genius and the dark desperation of his tormented mind. The obsessed Vincent van Gogh painted the way other men breathe, driving away family and friends, including artist Paul Gauguin [Anthony Quinn, 1956 Best Supporting Actor Academy Award winner]. Directed by Vincente Minnelli and saturated with the hues of Vincent van Goghs sea, field and sky. Lust for Life captures the ecstasy of art and the agony of one mans life.

FILM FACTS: Academy Awards Won: Anthony Quinn for Actor in a Supporting Role. Nominations: Kirk Douglas for Best Actor. Nominations: Cedric Gibbons, Hans Peters and Preston Ames for Best Art Direction (Color). Nominations: Edwin B. Willis and F. Keogh Gleason for Set Decoration. Nominations: Norman Corwin for Writing (Screenplay for Adaption). Two hundred enlarged colour photos were used representing Vincent Van Goghs completed canvases; these were in addition to copies that were executed by an American art teacher, Robert Parker. In preparation for the film, Kirk Douglas practiced painting crows so that he could reasonably imitate Vincent van Gogh at work. Based on the 1934 novel by Irving Stone and adapted by Norman Corwin.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: For many years, it was common wisdom in Hollywood that an artist's life was not a successful subject for film and, truth be told, many potentially fascinating biographies have made dreadful films. So, although M-G-M owned the rights since 1946 of Irving Stone's hugely popular 1934 novel about the tortured painter Vincent van Gogh, a film version was repeatedly shelved as too risky. But after a very successful international Vincent van Gogh exhibit in the 1950s introduced his work to hundreds of thousands of people.

Vincente Minnelli was the ideal choice to bring the story to the screen. A former stage designer known for his visual style that mirrored and amplified the dramatic story of each of his films, he was the right match for a movie about a painter. But he had to fight several battles to get the look he wanted; some he won, some he didn't. Vincente Minnelli didn't want to use the CinemaScope aspect ratio for Lust for Life and reasoning that, as he said in his autobiography, but the then-popular process was a must for M-G-M, which like every other studio was looking for cinematic gimmicks to overcome the threat of television.

Another problem concerned with filming Vincent van Gogh's actual paintings. The masterpieces could have been ruined by the intense light required for motion picture cameras, so Vincente Minnelli sent crews into museums and private collectors' homes to capture about 200 of Vincent van Gogh's paintings with special portrait cameras that made time exposures without excessive light. Enlarged transparencies were then made of each shot, which were backlit and re-filmed with special lenses.

Clearly, the most dramatic feature of the life of Vincent van Gogh was the difference between his painting, which was forceful and sunny and warm, and the character of his disposition, which was clouded by dark and maddening moods, including the celebrated episode of his slicing off his own ear. Thus, it is gratifying to see that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in the persons of producer John Houseman and a crew of superb technicians, has consciously made the flow of colour and the interplay of compositions and hues the most forceful devices for conveying a motion picture comprehension of Vincent van Gogh.

The tortuous career of the artist is recounted faithfully, from his experiences as an evangelist in a Belgian mining district to his ultimate suicide. The brutal rebuff of his love is in it, the turmoil of his affair with a prostitute, the uncertainty of his life in Paris and the explosiveness of his residence in Arles with Paul Gauguin. The incidents of the painter's manifestations of insecurity and emotional torment are well arranged, and Kirk Douglas performs them with superior intensity, variety and yet restraint. What is more, and especially fascinating, is the remarkable resemblance he bears to the famous self-portraits of the artist which are discreetly but prominently displayed. Vincente Minnelli's celebration of the life of Vincent van Gogh is well-researched and enjoyable, even if it gives the best lines to Paul Gauguin.

Don't let the catchpenny title, especially from the doorstop biography by Irving Stone, put you off as this is an extremely superior example of the Hollywood biopic, the tale of tortured painter Vincent van Gogh who is uncannily well played by Kirk Douglas, who seems to capture the very essence of the tormented artist, though it was actually Anthony Quinn's Paul Gauguin that won the OSCAR for this film. It's lovingly crafted by brilliant director Vincente Minnelli, with superb colour and CinemaScope cinematography from Russell Harlan and the great Freddie Young, who was responsible for the glorious look of Lawrence of Arabia and making the authentic Arles location look stunning and Miklos Rozsa, who also did the scores of Spellbound and The Lost Weekend gives a sweeping magical fine score are also major plus points. This intelligent, beautifully made film was never a commercial success, but it acquired a cult following, largely owing to Vincente Minnelli's colour sense and Kirk Douglas's magnificent crystalline performance.

Touching and tragic, this is a glorious, brilliant film that memorialises the world's greatest painter and perhaps the world's most loving brother. While its early scenes have a Hollywood look about them, much of the film is shot outdoors and has a great breath of air and the free spirit that somehow led Vincent van Gogh to his incredible and indelible visions. Despite half-a-dozen recent attempts to ""correct"" this biopic, Vincente Minnelli's agonised portrait of the life of Vincent Van Gogh remains the definitive film on the subject of Vincent van Gogh. Intelligently written, made with conviction and crowned by two passionately intense performances, Lust for Life is a key film of the mid-1950s. Kirk Douglas wanted to play Van Gogh ever since director Jean Negulesco told him he resembled the artist. He threw himself into the role; to the point of taking on so many of the artist's stormy, unstable traits he frightened his wife in his off-hours at home.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Lust for Life is presented in a brilliant aspect ratio 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and especially with a stunning 1080p encoded image. The film used what was then a brand-new process dubbed Metrocolor, which replaced three-strip Technicolor with a single three-layer strip. It has been reported that a new 4k scan of the original camera negative was the source for this 1080p encoded Blu-ray. The film's grain structure is fine and natural, and the black levels are excellent, especially when Vincent van Gogh's visit to the coal mines, is a good example.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Lust for Life has a really good 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound field. Characters at the opposite ends of the screen routinely have their voices issuing from the left and right front speakers. The track does not have significant rear channel activity except to open up the lush orchestral score by Mikls Rzsa which is the real benefactor here. This is not a film that has a lot of action, but this soundtrack proves that subtle touches can really make a lot of difference. This is not the type of soundtrack that jumps out as well crafted, but it handles all the basics and throws in some great presence.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Film Historian Dr. Drew Casper: Dr. Drew Casper is the professor of film at the USC and the author of Vincente Minnelli and the Film Musical and among other books. This commentary was originally on the 2006 Warner Home Video DVD release. Sadly as Dr. Drew Casper talks about this film and all involved with the film, you can hear he is reading a script. Sadly his voice is very effete, monotone, pedestrian and so very boring, plus he is very effete, which if you look up the in the dictionary, it tells you that a person of this personality who is effete it says they are affected, over-refined, ineffectual, artificial and pretentious, plus his research and minimal charisma doesnt help, so if you can stay awake while he drones on, you will learn some worthwhile information.

Special Feature: Van Gogh: Darkness into Light [1956] [1080p] [16:9] [20:20] M-G-M produced this short film Van Gogh: Darkness Into Light, and is narrated and presented by Dore Schary and showing the European locations used for the filming, to promote the film Lust for Life. In the film, a 75-year-old woman from Auvers-sur-Oise and not Jeanne Calment, who lived in Arles several hundred kms to the south, who claims to have known Vincent van Gogh when she was a young girl, meets star actor Kirk Douglas, and comments on how much he looks like the painter. At the start and ending of the film, the creators list and thank a number of galleries, collectors, and historians who allowed the works of Vincent van Gogh to be photographed for the film.

Theatrical Trailer [1956] [1080p] [2.55:1] [3:04] This is the original trailer for Lust for Life.

Finally, for a 50-year-old film, Lust for Life' image is surprisingly bright and vibrant. Warner Home Video has done a commendable job restoring this film to a condition that must be comparable to what audiences saw in 1956. Those who saw the film during its original cinema run, or those who have a passion for overly melodramatic films classics, will probably find much to praise about Lust for Life, which was always a very special film; especially with Vincente Minnellis intensity behind the camera felt in every frame projected onto the screen. Here, at long last, is the film in a manner befitting its artistry. You are going to love this Blu-ray disc. Its that simple. Highly Recommended!

397584,5,6301971191,"When producer John Houseman and director Vincente Minnelli got together to bring Irving Stone's best seller ""Lust for Life"" to the big screen in 1956 they spared no expense in their quest to show the life of Vincent Van Gogh, the post Impressionist Dutch painter, to a whole new audience. MGM made the film into a big Cinemascope production and cast Kirk Douglas in the title role. Warner's has finally released the film on Blu-ray and the results are outstanding to say the least. This new Blu-ray is a big improvement over the 2006 standard DVD with colors being not only brighter, but rich and deeper too. The cinematography by the great Freddie Young (""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Ryan's Daughter"") and Russell Harlan is given new life on Blu-ray(Bitrate: 27.92) and the richness of Van Gogh's paintings is front and center with colors just popping off the screen. Since it was filmed in Cinemascope(Aspect ratio: 2.35:1)  there is some movement within the frame during some of the long shots, but overall this is a very pleasing viewing experience that should delight fans of the film. There are no vertical lines, white specks, torn or damage frames and one only has to view the documentary included with the special features to see the difference in the colors. Director Vincente Minnelli filmed at the actual locations that Van Gogh lived and worked and this is where Freddie Young's cinematography is really on display. During his short lifetime, Vincent Van Gogh created over 2,100 works of art and many of the most famous of these are used in the film. The honesty of Van Gogh's paintings and colors are really on display with yellows, blues, reds, greens and whites looking exceptional on Blu-ray. As for the acting, Kirk Douglas gives probably his greatest performance as the tortured artist bringing his acting talents to full measure during Van Gogh's descent into mental illness. Anthony Quinn gives great support in his role as painter Paul Gauguin which won him an Oscar. ""Lust for Life"" is 122 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese and Czech. The Audio: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital for the following: French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. Special features include a commentary by film historian Drew Casper and a documentary ""Van Gogh: Darkness into Light"" about the making of the film.(Please note that the Blu-ray disc itself is housed in an eco-cutout case so you may want to switch to a more study and solid Blu-ray case for added protection). ""Lust for Life"" is an excellent film on the tragic life of one of the greatest painters in the history of art and Warner's new Blu-ray has given it a whole new life on Blu-ray.

397673,4,6301971191,"You should see this picture. Why not 5 stars? Despite the screenplay's adaptation by Norman Corwin, one of the towering figures in radio in its great days as the medium upon which much of America relied for its entertainment and enlightenment, the film has difficulty assimilating the material (via Irving Stone's novel) contained in Van Goghs three volumes of letters ( at which I just looked, as they sit placidly in their case at the top of one of my bookcases). The tumultuous frustrated 'affair', all on his side only, with his cousin, which is simply one episode in the narrative, would, itself, constitute a full length film, as would the year which he spent 'married' to a prostitute and living as surrogate father to her child. The Gauguin affair, which earned Anthony Quinn an Oscar, is another full length film waiting to be made, and so it goes. For one with even the cursory knowledge I possess, the film somehow feels like watching a two hour documentary on the VietNam or Iraq Wars. One gets the gist of the story but feels frustrated at the absence of greater penetration into the depths of each event portrayed.
Having expatiated upon what for me were weaknesses, let me again commend the film to all, particularly those represented by the many students and younger people I saw so often crowded into the gallery at NYC's Metropolitan Museum, where a dozen or so prime Van Goghs are to be found (and a representative collection of Gauguin's as well), or at the fewer, but still choice number at the same City's Museum of Modern Art. in the first fifth floor gallery of which, Cezanne (who in their conception is the great pre-modern figure, since both Picasso and Matisse-among others- swore by him). Once again, Van Gogh and Gauguin are hung pretty much side by side.
The film is a fine, sometimes dramatically moving, precis of Van Goghs adult life. It features a well-controlled performance by its Star, Kirk Douglas, who manages the underlying desperation and manic attacks without 'chewing the scenery', as they say. In one of the earliest breakout performances from the many supporting roles in which he was very much subordinated to others, Anthony Quinn handles his scenes with Douglas with aplomb, although allowed to show only the smallest measure of the complex character of that most notable artist. Fine radio and screen actor Everett Sloane provides a nice, although very brief, impersonation of the well-known (to art historians) role of Dr. Gachet. Other supporting actors do well in necessarily overshadowed roles. By  way of better understanding the film, one should know that mental illness was not unique in his family. Two of his siblings, his brother Theo and a sister being affected, although to what degree he shared with them a source of the illness, I don't have the psychiatric knowledge to say.
In sum, this is certainly a film to be seen and, hopefully, be encouraged by, to go further into Van Gogh's life and, particularly, his work, which is generously sampled in the movie.",1418256000,2,3023,4.8699029126213595

Watching the moments of emotions displayed by Kirk Douglas are exactly the same as have been expressed by Irving Stone and are according to the available evidence on the Artist. This type of acting is known in the film making as 'style of the Method school' which was mastered by Marlin Brando, Humphrey Bogart & James Dean.

397833,5,6301971191,Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn deliver passionate performances as two starving artists living and working together. The characters' relationship is one of love and hate. Douglas' performance is particularly touching. He plays a man who is slowly going mad - and he pulls it off in a manner very unlike his other tough guy roles.,1400112000,,328,4.9818181818181815
397834,3,6301971191,"Lust for Life purports to the tell the life of Vincent Van Gogh with the same high-minded pretension of other mid-century artist pictures such as The Agony and the Ecstasy and Moulin Rouge.  Entertaining, but too clean, too safe.  Too much Miklos Rosza portentousness in sonic bombast.  More sentiment has been lavished upon Van Gogh than is healthy, seeing him too often as the Christ of oil painting, but he somehow gets lost in all this entertainment value.  For a good artist's life, try Pollack, with Ed Harris, or you could read Van Gogh's letters for a real pictures of his strange, humble man.  Kirk Douglas, who often had a clause about taking his shirt off on screen is so awed by Van Gogh, that I believe he remains clad in this effort.",1399852800,2,747,4.586466165413534

397898,5,6301971191,"Having just read Van Gogh The Life ,an outstanding 900 page biography, of Vincent Van Gogh I was curious to see this film again after many years to see how it lined up against the book. I was very impressed with the film for a number of reasons. It is obviously condensed compared to the book and begins with Vincent already a grown man trying to enter the ministry. The time he spent in Arles with Gaugin takes up a significant part of the film even though their time living and working together was really only three months out of his 37 years. That aside the performances by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn are both excellent. Douglas particularly does well in conveying the artists manic depressive states and his essential feeling of isolation. The scenery and and the way the film incorporates the actual paintings of Van Gogh and sets them in context is truly remarkable.
A film by necessity must have a buildup ,a climax and a conclusion and the choices that were made by Vincente Minelli to achieve that without compromising the essence of Van Gogh's life story result in a wonderful concise view into a very complex artist and troubled man.
Overall I thought after reading the book that I might find the film trite but I was happily surprised to find it completely engaging from beginning to end. It is an excellent movie that has held up quite well after almost 60 years.",1395705600,,1381,4.5951417004048585

I've always felt you usually get your money's worth when you see Kirk Douglas.  I've never seen him screw up anything and I can see why he got an Oscar Nomination.

If art and images are of no concern to you, you probably won't enjoy this story. But, I am an avid photographer and the only way to continue to learn is from the greats and Van Gogh was one of them, though somewhat crazy, he was extremely bright when it came to writing about art and digging deep within himself to find his creativity. I would recommend that to be able to see this movie with more knowledge about Van Gogh, that you read a book about him first. He communicated with his brother extensively and manner of these communications where left for future generations to analyze.",1388188800,,703,4.5

397977,2,6301971191,"Vincente Minnelli took on the tumultuous life of famed painter Vincent Van Gogh in this acclaimed 1956 film, `Lust for Life'.  I was extremely excited by the promise this movie held and settled in, finally, to watching it over the weekend.  What I found was a disappointment of sorts, a film that never really capitalized on that said `passion' and produced a film that felt uneven and surprisingly un-textured; a plain almost flaccid depiction of a life lived to the full (but not in a necessarily `good' kind of way).

Kirk Douglas tries to find shades of Van Gogh's madness but winds up coming across like a mere caricature, lost in the segments that are not as clearly defined or strung together as they needed to be.  The film is also admittedly NOT a direct biopic, decidedly fudging facts and delivering a fictional portrait of the man.  This fact makes the film even more disappointing, for it really had the liberties to go all out and make the most of the film's title.  It didn't.  For a guy who loves the biopic, `Lust for Life' nearly bored me to tears.  The way that the subject was handled feels so lazy and uninspired.

Thank god for Anthony Quinn who does nothing of real note and yet at least struts his stuff in a scene or two and captures our attention.  His Oscar win is a joke, especially when you consider that Robert Stack was also a nominee, but at least he was fun.

The visual grainy nature of the film takes away from the overall impact and also contradicts the visual allure (or should I say `mental allure') of a film about a painter such as Van Gogh.  I was also surprised at how little depth this film offered, giving us little reason to invest in Van Gogh's life and really no reason to care much for how it all panned out.  It was an exercise in mediocrity that failed to live up to the expectations I had for it.",1376870400,,1847,4.412979351032448

""Last year, though, to front-page headlines around the world, two reputable German academics, Hans Kaufmann and Rita Wildegans, published a book offering a very different account of what happened that night. In ""Van Goghs Ohr: Paul Gauguin und der Pakt des Schweigens"" (""Van Gogh's Ear: Paul Gauguin and the Pact of Silence""), they argue that it was Gauguin who sliced off van Gogh's ear, with a sword that he carried with him for self-defense, and that the two artists--out of shame on van Gogh's part, guilt on Gauguin's--decided to keep the truth to themselves.""

Although made decades ago, the film actually did a very good job capturing the essence and key moments of Van Gogh's life.  Far superior, for example, to the film ""Vincent & Theo""  which is horrid.  There is still a lot of unknowns about Vincent's mental or medical problems- but he was obsessive compulsive and emotionally insecure and fragile, that's for sure.  Whether he was bipolar, manic-depressive, poisoned by bad alcohol, or epileptic, we may never know for sure.  The new book also casts doubt about whether he really took his own life- but I still feel pretty certain that he did shoot himself in a manic moment or during a seizure- as when he sliced off his ear.  No one was there to witness either incident, so we will never know.  Also, Kirk Douglas does an amazing job in this film and if you see photos or paintings of Vincent, Kirk Douglas does capture Vincent's physical traits as well as his latent rage, (ultimately turned inward against himself),  and his sense of desperation.

The story is so convincingly depicted that one wonders at how these paintings survived such mishandling.  There were great insights into the turbulent relationship between these two artists, who each had his own emotional problems and opposing viewpoints on how to create art.

398185,5,6301971191,"I saw on TCM a ""making of"" special about this film, and it looked interesting. And I've always liked van Gogh's artwork. So I decided to give this a try.

Now to understand how much I enjoyed this film, you have to understand how I normally ""watch"" movies: with my nose buried in my computer, writing software or fiction. Once in a while I look up for an exciting scene, but mostly I listen to the film in the background.

Not far into ""Lust for Life"", I put down the computer. Then I turned off the room light, so I could get a clearer picture. This was one film I truly WATCHED. The director did a phenomenal job of putting van Gogh's work into the context of the real places where he worked. He even hired locals for many of the lesser roles. The movie made me feel like I was there, and gave me a new appreciation for works I had long enjoyed.

And once the film caught my attention, it spoke to me. I'm in two creative fields, and I've experienced times where the work just took over my mind. The more I worked, the more the ideas drove me to even more ambitious ideas, almost like a feedback loop. It's hard for me even to describe; but Kirk Douglas in this film captured that feeling exactly, and I really identified with the man. At the same time, in van Gogh's case this drive took over his life; and the result was tragic (and a little ominous).

Since then, I've researched the real story. The film isn't 100% historically accurate. It's a little sanitized and a little dramatized. But the differences are small, and inconsequential.

Finally, I have to note the excellent performance of Anthony Quinn as Gauguin (sp?). I honestly couldn't recognize him in this role. I'm more familiar with his later roles, where it seemed like directors hired him to play Anthony Quinn, kindly wise old man. This film made me realize I've missed some of his best work. He really became the character for me.",1303948800,3,1903,4.425714285714286

398188,4,6301971191,"I purchased this movie to show to my middle school students.  I did have to tell them that Kirk Douglas is Michael Douglas's Dad.  He does a wonderful job of playing an over the top sensitive yet disturbed Van Gogh.  Although not rated, I would probably give it a rating of PG.  The imagery is wonderful!  The extras and actors chosen to portray the subjects of Van Gogh's paintings were so eerily accurate.  The scenery is beautiful, and many of Van Gogh's most famous works are reproduced in scenes.  My students enjoyed seeing ""Van Gogh's Bedroom"" brought to life, as well as the many portraits of his friends.  The actor who plays the postman is just wonderful.  Anthony Quinn is an excellent Paul Gauguin. The friendship between the two is quite touching and the students seem to really understand what a tortured soul Van Gogh was.

I did obtain parent permission because of the drinking, smoking and fighting in the movie, the violence of the ear cutting is not shown graphically but there is a bit of blood, and he does shoot himself in the end.  Mild language, Vincent says ""hell"" several times.  They insinuate that his girlfriend is a prostitute but that seemed to go over their heads.  Also, they do drink absinthe although most of them did not know what it was.

Their favorite part was of course when he cut off his ear.  I think the acting is a little bit over the top, but I loved it.  I would recommend this movie to teachers and anyone that is familiar with Van Gogh's paintings and wants to see them brought to life.  The visual aspect alone makes it extremely worthwhile, and outweighs any heavy handed acting.",1275868800,3,1630,4.58477508650519

I have seen.
In all of them there was some claim for their insanity:
Picasso, Pollack, Klee, and van Gogh.
The film makers and biographers have no mercy on the dead.
Three of these were relatively successful while they were alive
and the last wasn't.
What is clear in all these cases is that these artists
were not restricted by convention in the way they painted or saw the world.
The best most believable part of this movie was the love
of van Gogh's brother for him, the paintings showed and his efforts to try to find a
place in the world.
I've read in a news article that the pathology of van Gogh's brain disorder
caused his strange and wonderful use of color...
This movie was probably good for the selling price of the canvas
in investors hands, but I really think that van Gogh
deserved more while he was alive.",1253232000,3,887,4.381818181818182

398249,5,6301971191,"In one of his finest performances, Kirk Douglas gives a dead-on and very intense portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh, capturing both the brilliance and the madness of the doomed artist to perfection.
 We first encounter Van Gogh as an idealistic young man, refusing to accept that a society of Belgian missionaries have rejected his application. He begs to be used by the society in any way possible, and the board concedes. From his time among the lowly miners and potato gatherers, he produces the first of his paintings, ""Dutch Peasant Woman"", and ""The Potato Eaters"". The colors are dark and muted earth tones, and the figures are careworn. But in due time, Missionary Society representatives denounce his missionary work as demeaning to the clergy  because he insists on living at the same level as the people and giving them his possessions. He, in turn,denounces them as hyprocites.
 After some time on his own, his brother, Theo(James Donald)finds him,  and brings him home, making an effort to sell his paintings. At home, we see his tempestuous relationship with his father (Henry Daniell), and his attraction to his newly widowed cousin, Kay( Jeanette Starke), and her young son, Jan(Mickey Maza), who fuel his artistic creativity for a while. But when the lonely painter becomes too instant on marriage, he loses them both. A confrontational scene at her parents' home reveals signs of madness.
  He later encounters a lonely laundress named Christine(Pamela Brown)in a bar. They quickly take up residence together, and he looks after her infant son as though he were his own. But due to Vincent's inability  to support them, that relationship also falls apart.
 After the death of their father, Theo invites Vincent to live in Paris to see what other artists are doing. Among the prominent artists that he meets are Camille Pissarro (David Leonard), Georges Seurat (David Bond), and Paul Gaugin( Anthony Quinn), the last of whom later stays with Van Gogh at his house in Arles for a time.
 Van Gogh also finds friendship with the postman, Roulin (Niall MacGuinnis), and the action in the story is moved along via the recital of Vincent's letters to the unflinchingly dedicated Theo.
 Directors Vincent Minnelli, and George Cukor successfully capture Van Gogh's world, and give light to what inspired the contents of the Impressionist's canvases. We see this in the gold light of Arles, as created by the sun on the wheat fields, the blossoms of the trees, and the lights of the city at night time, which figure in the painting, ""Starry Night"".
 The main self-inflicted crisis of Vincent's life takes place after a feud with Gaugin. The two appear as an Impressionist Era Oscar Madison and  Felix Unger until Gaugin walks away from a feud, and Van Gogh pursues him with a razor blade for a time before returning to his apartment and severing his own ear. The tortured scream resulting from this calamity is the scream of all agonized humanity.
 Checking himself into a mental hospital at Saint-Remy, he finds new inspiration for his work, but continues to suffer from seizures and paranoia. Marion Ross has a few brief scenes as Sister Clotilde at this juncture.
  Although still suffering from seizures, Van Gogh decides to create his final painting, ""Crows Over the Wheat Field"" which has both brilliant and dark symbolism.
  The film accurately recreates Van Gogh's acquaintances, such as Dr. Gachet(Everett Sloane) who were immortalized on canvas, and gives a considerable portrayal of those closest to Van Gogh, such as his sister, Willhelmien (Jill Bennett).
 All in all, skillful direction and fine performances move the troubled life of Vincent Van Gogh past its dark ending and give it new illumination, and we see how Theo Van Gogh's belief in his brother's artistic ability has ultimately paid off.",1248480000,,3815,5.0094936708860756

398334,5,6301971191,"People rightly cite Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro as thespians who impressively invest their all in the portrayals of the characters they are bringing to life, but I honestly think one of the actors most overlooked for his capacity to deliver an intense transformation is Kirk Douglas. To prove this, all anyone need ever do is to partake of the engrossing, frequently wounding, experience of viewing Vincente Minnelli's 1956 masterpiece, Lust For Life. As Douglas channels the tormented soul of the tragic artist Vincent Van Gogh, Minnelli's camera pans across the strikingly gorgeous countryside of rural France, every bit as hypnotically stunning in the 1950's as it surely was for the impressionists of the nineteenth-century. Lust For Life is a meticulous labor of love, admiration, and obvious respect that still manages to treat its central character without the reverence that would have weakened the impact of its subject matter. No lurid tabloidesque tell-all oozing drama for shock value, Lust For Life gives audiences an up close view of Van Gogh's incarnation as he himself must have felt it happening. At times a helpless victim of disorder and circumstance, at others a commanding genius able to convey his own higher vision of supercharged reality, Van Gogh as interpreted by Douglas is surely one of the screen's most engaging figures. Employing the landscapes, settings, in some cases the actual locations germane to Van Gogh's brief, pain-filled existence, Lust For Life is a rich film that rarely fails to reach the empathetic sensibilities of any viewer, or activate the mind.",1224288000,2,1600,5.229571984435798
398335,4,6301971191,"The above title was my favorite line from Lust For Life. Without a doubt Kirk Douglases' finest performance. Vincente Minelli definitely did his homework on Van Gogh for this film.

While watching it, I couldn't help but think of Don McCleans' song 'Vincent' a moving tribute to the tortured artist. Actually, that song would have been a good contribution to the DVD's director commentary.",1211155200,,389,5.078125
398336,5,6301971191,"I gave this film a watch recently, after a period of about 12 years. I am still impressed by Kirk Douglas. He is DEFINITELY one of Hollywood's best actors! In ""Lust For Life"", he may very well have done his best work. Of course, he can't be ignored with his portrayal of Spartacus, but there is more accurate historical reference in regards to Vincent Van Gogh. That Van Gogh was mentally ill is irrefutable. It is curious, that civilization still has no place for people with Van Gogh's ""condition"".

The see-saw highs and lows that Van Gogh experienced were convincingly portrayed by Douglas. I believe it has everything to do with Kirk Douglas' expressive face. While it may at times, appear as though cut from rock, you can easily see what's going on just by looking at that face!

Anthony Quinn, likewise, did a fantastic job portraying Vincent's friend, Gauguin. The period in which these two men lived must have been full of wonder at the natural world, the likes of which we very rarely see today, because we are so preoccupied with ""Modernization"". This wonder is expressed in Van Gogh's paintings. While some may be dismissive of his style, he was savant-like in bringing the richness of what he saw onto canvas. In ""Lust For Life"", we are witness to the demons that plagued Van Gogh for the majority of his life, and ultimately became the engines of his own destruction.

It is painful at times, to see a man so at war with himself, yet able to convey a sense of utter calm in his paintings. During the infamous ""ear scene"", it is difficult to watch him succumbing to his demons so fully, that physical pain brings no relief to him.

""Lust For Life"", for those who have not seen it yet, is a powerful film on the life of one of history's greatest painters. His works are displayed on-screen at the beginning and the end of the film. The performances of the film's principle actors is nothing short of phenomenal! Folks, they just don't make them like this anymore.",1208822400,5,1975,4.6022727272727275

The movie, which chronicles the life and struggles of the Dutch painter, Vincent Van Gogh, was very well done and one of Kirk Douglas' best performances.  It was troubling at times due to a heart-rending depiction of Van Gogh's serious mental illness.  Other strong performances by Anthony Quinn, who played the painter Paul Gauguin, and James Donald, who played Van Gogh's brother, added to the enjoyment of the movie.  The film was visually stunning and one was able to see the evolution of Van Gogh's art.  I look forward to my trip to see Van Gogh's art in person.",1200096000,5,702,4.713114754098361
398339,5,6301971191,"Kirk Douglas is at his finest in his portrayal of Vincent van Gough, the tortured painter who wanted so much, but was held back by his continuing mental illness. In today's world, Vincent would be put on a regimine of drugs, and lived a life of obscurity. In his day, his only relief from the inner torment was through his painting. It's interesting to note that he was never recognized a great painter until long after he snuffed out his own life. At one time, one of his former landlady's used some of his paintings to cover up holes in her barn, Many of his paintings have been lost forever to time, but the ones remaining are now looked upon as some of the most heart-felt paintings ever done.  With Anthony Quinn portraying Paul Gaugin, the movie unfolds to show a life of highs and lows, of a man tortured by his own mind. Perhaps that's what draws us to Vincent today; each of us can see a part of ourselves in the paintings of a man that few understood. Only now do we recognize the genius of this man. It's well  acted, well directed, and being able to see the real paintings of this man bring the story to life.",1196985600,7,1121,4.308056872037914

398341,5,6301971191,"Not only does KIRK DOUGLAS bear a remarkable resemblance to the real Vincent Van Gogh, but he gives a deeply felt, bigger than life performance in the role of a lifetime, fully deserving his Academy Award nomination.

The letterbox version on TCM doesn't do justice to the film's brilliant color photography, deliberately muted for the early coal mining scenes but crisp and clear when it comes to Van Gogh's now famous paintings. I haven't seen the DVD version, but I hope it's considerably better than the print showing on cable.

At any rate, it's tremendously well done--the entire look of the production creating the sense of time and authentic atmosphere and actually filmed on the actual location sites with an impressive cast of villagers and supporting actors, including PAMELA BROWN, NIALL MacGINNIS (as The Postman), and most of all, JAMES DONALD as brother Theo, who nurtures his brother and supports him financially but is unable to sell any of his paintings--except one.

It's a fine recreation of the Irving Stone novel and Douglas immerses himself in the character of Van Gogh, much the way ANTHONY QUINN does as Gauguin. Quinn's stormy, tempestuous relationship with Douglas provides some electric moments of conflict.

The score by Miklos Rozsa accents the drama at every turn, slashing at the drama the way Van Gogh slashed at his canvas with thick brush strokes. It's starkly dramatic without ever being overbearing.

Vincent Minnelli's direction is above reproach. A finer tribute to the tormented artist could not be imagined with so many of his canvases shown on screen in impressive close-ups.",1190505600,2,1617,5.109848484848484
398342,5,6301971191,"Based on Irving Stone's popular book, Minnelli's beautiful, vibrant film tracks Van Gogh's tragic journey into obsessive madness with unusual perceptiveness and insight. Douglas's fiery performance is a career peak, but Oscar winner Anthony Quinn nearly steals his thunder with a brief but indelible turn as Gauguin. Minnelli filmed on location in Holland and France, even borrowing actual Van Gogh works to use in the production.

There are a number of scenes where a shot seques from Van Gogh actually painting one of his masterpieces to the painting itself. Again this is marvellous stuff.

Naturally the acting is good, Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn spark well off each other and rest of the cast are all good.

398435,5,6301971191,"""Lust for Life"", Vincente Minnelli's rich interpretation of Irving Stone's Vincent Van Gogh bio-novel, is a film both compelling and repelling; in delving into the psyche of the artist (unforgettably portrayed by Kirk Douglas), one can see an untrained, unbridled genius smashing convention to open viewers' eyes to a world defined by passion; yet in doing so, we share in the growing nightmares and agony of his creative mind, teetering toward the madness that would destroy him, and it is an unsettling experience, to be sure!

This is a film so rich in visual imagery (with a Technicolor 'palette' that attempts to recreate Van Gogh's view of his world), that it demands repeated viewings, just to savor the details. From wheat fields 'aflame' in color, to night skies that nearly writhe in waves of darkness, the elemental nature of the artist's vision is spectacularly captured. And in experiencing the world through his eyes, the loving, yet uncomprehending concern of his brother (James Donald), and more hedonistic, shallow patronizing, and gradual disgust of fellow artist Paul Gauguin (Anthony Quinn, in his Oscar-winning performance), become elemental 'barriers', as well. Van Gogh wants to 'speak', but no one can understand his 'language', not even the artist, himself!

This film deserves a wealth of bonus features, yet the DVD offers only a very dry audio commentary, by film historian Dr. Drew Casper, which sounds like one of those college lectures I used to sleep through! MGM produced a wonderful documentary, when the film was made, about the production, locations, and reactions of locals, who knew Van Gogh, of Kirk Douglas' dead-on appearance and portrayal. Why this was not included is a mystery, as it provides the kind of insights Casper's comments don't!

Kirk Douglas never plunged as deeply into a portrayal as he did, in ""Lust for Life"", and the experience nearly crushed him, as he related in his autobiography, ""Ragman's Son"". His total immersion in the role SHOULD have won him an Oscar (Yul Brynner won, instead, for ""The King and I""), and his bitterness and disappointment at the snub would haunt him, to this day. With the passage of time, his performance has only increased in luster and stature, and it certainly shows an actor at the top of his form!

""Lust for Life"" is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed, even if this edition is lacking in 'extras'!",1167782400,10,2402,5.027638190954774

Melodramatic, affected monkeys bopping around papery, evenly lit sets, with occasional exterior establishing shots. Stage acting? Silent film acting? Who cares. The activity of a scene ends and suddenly the lighting jumps 3 shades brighter, because they have inserted another film layer for a slowly cross-fading transition to the next scene. Yes, its one of those.

Its unfair to judge this movie by today's standards, and unfair to this review not to.

--Did Van Gogh cut off his own ear?

--Did he mail it to anyone?

--Was it all over a man or a woman?

Anyway, after the ""accident"" I found the decision to simply shoot Douglas from his right for the rest of the picture rather than create some kind of make-up special effect for his ear, a rather tasteful one.

If you are curious about Van Gogh, but not curious enough to read ""Lust for Life"" then watch it.",1156377600,2,974,4.767857142857143
398437,5,6301971191,"Critics lambasted Kirk Douglas' performance as ""hammy"".  I don't see that at all.  This is, without a doubt, the Vincent Van Gogh that we read in ""Letters To Theo"" miraculously brought to life.

As with Van Gogh's actual life, the whole thing has a kind of creaking bipolarity to it; he has periods of creative bliss, happiness and fulfillment, but they are too short and his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often with too many people who can help him.  Anthony Quinn as Paul Gaughan would seem like a strange fit, but he pulls it off pretty well; you can feel the arguments crashing between them like thunderstorms, and Vincent's unwavering belief in their friendship is so innocent and enthusiastic that one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly.  Douglas communicates vividly what we suspect about Van Gogh from reading his correspondences, and from his paintings; that he was far too visionary to ever really make it in the practical world, or overcome his restlessness long enough to allow his art to mature.

The beginning of the film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated Van Gogh was from coteries and social mores.  His doomed-from-the-start mission to be a minister ends ironically--he was too Christian for the Christians.  While there is an explosion underground and poverty-stricken children die along with the very miner who introduced him to their real hellish existence, he is reprimanded by his spiritual ""superiors"" for dressing incorrectly.  Van Gogh is so enraged by this that he screams just what he thinks at them, and loses all chance of another path in life.

And throughout the film he remains a Christian, but he is too much of a self-absorbed and passionate artist to always retain his ethics.  Douglas' Van Gogh can stick with no situation or person very long: the only constant thread in his life is his passion for painting.  Sometimes the performance is so good we can feel Van Gogh's landmine madness coarsing through the screen and even empathize with those who had to reject him because fiery nature could be really scary at times.

We get the chance to see Van Gogh's paintings in a way we never have before, which is probably the best part of this movie.  That and his relationship with his long suffering brother Theo, played superbly by James Donald.  He should have gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor, not Anthony Quinn, who turns in roughly the same performance in every movie and happened to get lucky with this one.  Somewhere inside him he knows his brother is a genius, but he still has the flesh and blood Van Gogh to deal with financially and otherwise.  The ending could not have been remotely as powerful as it is without him.

This film, despite concerning a man of titanic imagination, is also a good realistic attack on the myth of the tortured artist as something romantic and to be envied. Barring his moments of vision, Van Gogh's life was a hell of sorts and led him to a miserable death.  This is nothing to envy or emulate and this movie communicates that.  Still, beautifully done and must see for anyone who wants to understand one of the greatest painters to ever live.",1150761600,7,3205,4.792727272727273
398438,5,6301971191,"Released theatrically in 1956, ""Lust for Life"" remains one of the finest films about an artist, in this case the great Dutch painter, Vincent Van Gogh. With his keen eye for colour, Vincente Minnelli was the ideal choice to direct this handsome film for MGM. Based on the best selling novel by Irving Stone, ""Lust for Life"" must have been a real treat to see on the big screen in all its Cinemascope and Metrocolor glory.

Vincent Van Gogh was, of course, the quintessential ""tortured soul"", who--after a brief but stormy career as a clergyman--found his true calling as an artist. We follow his life through his relationships with others--an overbearing, intolerant father--a generous, supportive brother (Theo)--a woman who spurns his love with a brutal finality--a poor, single mother, Christine, who for a time, offers him shelter from the ""storms of life""--and, of course, other artists, most notably the volatile Paul Gauguin. While today Vincent's paintings sell for millions of dollars, and he is recognized as a genius, he did not enjoy monetary success in this lifetime. In fact, despite his love of creating art, he still had to battle serious psychological demons.

As Van Gogh, Kirk Douglas is brilliant--easily one of the finest performances of his long and distinguished career. Visually, Mr. Douglas is perfect, but he also really seems to inhabit the skin and the mind of Van Gogh. He was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, and justifiably so (he lost to Yul Brynner in ""THe King and I""). As Paul Gauguin, Anthony Quinn did win the best supporting Oscar with a role tailor-made for his ebullient, earthy persona. James Donald is fine as Theo, the long-suffering, ever-faithful brother. Pamela Brown as Christine and Henry Daniell as Vincent's autocratic father are both memorable in smaller roles.

Unlike at least one other reviewer, I found the widescreen, colour DVD picture to be gorgeous. The scenes where we see Vincent create some of his famous paintings--for example--""Wheat Field With Crows"" are lovely. Many of his paintings from museums, galleries and private collections are woven into the story, or presented in a stunning collage at the end of the film. The Dolby Surround Stereo is effective for a film of this vintage. Extras are sparse--comments from film historian, Drew Casper, and a trailer.

The picture quality of film's transfer is unjustly dark throughout, deminissing the intended luminus pallette of colors that one would associates with the work of Van Gogh and the innovative process of  MetroColor.  It appears that no effort was taken to restore the film at all, and to add insult to injury, on an other wise extra-less disc Warner as found a way to create a digital looking transfer with macro blocking and edge enhancement throughout.

Even the lack of such simple details as the ommission of an insert card or disc artwork showcase yet again Warner's complete lack effort when producing this DVD.

The only bonus allotted, is a wonderfully dense commentary by Minnelli Historian Dr. Drew Casper.  It's a very dry, but informative track that would seem more at home on a Criterion Collection DVD rather than the normally lighter-fare Warner commentaries.  Its inclusion here only serves to taunt the buyer by giving them only a tiny morsel of what could have been a smorgasbord of extras.

Anyone who has seen Lust for Life on Tuner Classic Movies has seen the wonderful period making of documentary they bookend the film with, so why is this not included on the disc. With a track record like Warner's, the lack of extras on this disc is inexcusable.

Do I recommend you buy the DVD?  Emphatically, YES!  The cheap retail price and importance of the film for both Kirk Douglas and Minnelli fans make it a must buy.  If only someone at Warner showed this release the love that its many fans have for it we might one day see a better edition.",1140480000,4,1752,4.652597402597403
398493,5,6301971191,"Lust for Life based on Irving Stone's novel about Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) was filmed in 1956 and directed by Vincente Minnelli. Kirk Douglas as Vincent crackles with intensity. He won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal; depicting Van Gogh's artistic growth, deep loneliness and inevitable descent into madness with sensitivity and pathos. It is a moving performance that, along with Spartacus and Paths of Glory, is one of his best. Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. James Donald is especially touching as Vincent's loving Brother Theo. The film features a powerful and poignant musical score by the great film and Classical Music composer Miklos Rozsa, composer of music for Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Ivanhoe and The Lost Weekend amongst many others. This film is, along with John Huston's Moulin Rouge made in 1952 about the life of Toulouse-Latrec, one of my favorite Hollywood films about an artist.

As soon as the titles appear on this recently released DVD you are aware of the superb transfer to disc. Written with Van Gogh's trademark thick impasto technique, they leap off the screen with 3-dimensional brilliance, breathtakingly alive. This is important because the film contains dozens of Van Gogh's most famous art works, all filmed from the originals in the possession of private collectors and museums. With their thick swirls of color and movement, the images are stunningly beautiful; making the DVD of the film a living art gallery. This was worth the price of the DVD for me. I wish there was some way each one of the paintings could have been bookmarked on the DVD to make them easier to find. Alas no. However, the other more disappointing aspect of this DVD release is that it does not contain the 30 minute long ""Making of"" documentary that often followed the showing of this film on Turner Classic Movies. This fine documentary showed how modern locations in Holland, Belgium and France were painstakingly converted into the late 19th Century locations actually painted by Van Gogh. It also showed how Kirk Douglas developed his characterization. It featured the process by which extras were chosen amongst local townspeople, including one old French woman who had actually known Van Gogh, had seen him paint and remarked upon Douglas' uncanny resemblance to the painter. It is a wonderful little film and its absence from this DVD is inexplicable. There is certainly room for it. The only extras are a 3 minute trailer and a fine commentary by Dr. Drew Casper, a film historian who gives a deeper, more academic analysis of the film than is usual for a commercial release not on Criterion or Kino. This was a missed opportunity by Turner Entertainment that makes no sense and is deeply disappointing.

The film is in color shot in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 enhanced for widescreen TVs. It looks beautiful, almost 3-dimensionally vivid. It is 122 minutes in length. Sound is offered in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and sounds glorious. Miklos Rozsa's music sounds especially alive. Languages for menus are English and French. Subtitles are in English, French and Spanish. The region code is NTSC 1.

This is a film definitely worth getting for its beauty and its excellence. Its lack of appropriate extras is disappointing but that is tempered by gratitude for finally having this wonderful, deeply moving film available on DVD. I strongly recommend this DVD release for that fact alone.

398494,5,6301971191,"This film is a true treasure and deserves the highest praise. The movie was made with much respect for both painters Van Gogh and Gauguin. And it shows. Whenever I have viewed it, it has made me want to be right there as the story really happened. I cannot say that for any other film I have seen. I'm very happy it is finally being released on DVD in widescreen 1/31/06. A nice 50 year anniversary treat!",1138492800,4,405,4.2727272727272725
398495,5,6301971191,"I still maintain my personal conviction that, despite the enormous resonance of ""The wizard of Oz"", this film signs the second stage of Minelli, plenty of expressive maturity and artistic conviction far from commercial concessions.

You and me know the terrible risks you are exposed when some filmmaker dares to film the life of any painter.

There have been successful findings as the famous Norwegian film's Edward Munch from 1975, Caravaggio's Derek Jarman, Loutrec's Huston in the early fifties, Goya ( The German film of the eighties and Saura), Pollock. and in a lesser level , El Greco, but in general terms the most of the filmmakers do not like to bet for these sad, and very often tragic portraits.

I think that Kirk Douglas made two unmatchable performances in the fifties: this one and The Vikings. His Van Gogh characterization is superb as so did Anthony Quinn's Gaugin.

And despite the multiple films made for Minelli in his career, no other reachs the height of Lust for life.

Everything about this film is perfect. The script is great and the acting is wonderful. Many scenes were shot right where Van Gogh painted, and you can easily see it, the film looks like one of his paintings.  This is a film for art lovers, and the DVD delivers. I've seen it on Turner Classic Movies and the DVD is an improvement in picture quality.

398499,5,6301971191,"With an uncanny resemblance to the self-portraits of Vincent Van Gogh, Kirk Douglas is perfect for this detailed and wonderful production of the artist's life; it's a passionate performance of a troubled soul, whose creative urges battled with his mental illness.
The film has an intelligent script by Norman Corwin, based on Irving Stone's biographical novel. It picks up the story around 1879, when Van Gogh was 26 years old, and went to minister (unsuccessfully) to the coal miners of a destitute area, and from there takes us through his many different abodes, his relationship with ""Christine"", who is well played by Pamela Brown, and the flourishing of his art in his last 15 years of life.
The art direction is superb, and the recreations of the places Van Gogh painted a marvel, among them the famous yellow house he lived in and its bedroom, and my favorite, the pool hall, with its hanging lamps.
The cinematography by Freddy Young and Russell Harlan is terrific, and we get many full screen views of the original paintings, many of them lesser known pieces from private collections.
This was a multi-award winning film, and garnered an Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Anthony Quinn, who is fabulous as Paul Gauguin, whose personality was the complete opposite of his friend Van Gogh; the ego clashes when they attempted to live together are well illustrated in several scenes, and with a little addition to his nose, Quinn has been made to look exactly like Gauguin's famous self-portrait with the snake.
James Donald is excellent as Vincent's patient and generous brother, who was Van Gogh's central means of support for most of his lifetime, both financially and of his paintings.
A tremendous knowledge about art went into this film, and it's one of the best artist biographies ever put to film (another good one also came from a Stone best seller, ""The Agony and the Ecstasy""), and is a must-see for artists and anyone with an interest in Van Gogh's genius. Total running time is 122 minutes.",1086048000,38,2007,4.8885630498533725

398501,5,6301971191,"One of the greatest films ever made about the madness of  creative genius. As films about artists go, I like this film better than POLLOCK and almost as much as BASQUIAT. This is very much an overlooked CLASSIC. I have friends who are fans of Van Gogh's who have never heard of this film. Based on the book of the same title by Irving Stone and for those who love DEAR THEO: the abridged letters of Vincent Van Gogh, a must see. This film absolutely conveys the heartbreaking feeling of this starving misunderstood genius pounding his lifeblood into canvas in a French atelier or countryside while the gallery owners scoff and the painter remains unrecognized and unloved.
Kirk Douglas' finest performance, is fraught with peril. Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin, is superb. The script, some of which was taken from Van Gogh himself, is sometimes dated but always poignant: ""Sometimes the pictures come to me as if in a dream, with a terrible lucidity."" BRILLIANT!!
Unfortunately the VHS format is fullscreen which begs the question; WHY IS THIS MASTERPIECE UNAVAILABLE IN WIDESCREEN ON DVD!?! What a cultural wasteland: I could probably find ERNEST GOES TO CAMP on DVD, but try to find this CLASSIC and the clerk at the local HOLLYWOOD VIDEO might say, ""LUST FOR LIFE? That would probably be in the Adult Film Section."" I hope someone is working hard to preserve this Masterpiece. Anything less would be a shame. My VHS tape has been viewed so many times the magnetic particles are starting to fall off. If the DVD doesn't come out soon I'll be forced to buy another copy on VHS.(SIGH)

BLU-RAY UPDATE 2-13-15: The new Blu-ray is fantastic. Older versions have always had sort of a washed-out drab look. In the BD version colors just POP! Reportedly they did a 4K scan of the original color negatives. This film has never looked this good and never will. Worthy upgrade from the SD DVD.

Interestingly, Douglas' co-star Anthony Quinn won an oscar as best supporting actor, just as he had previously won an oscar for supporting Brando in ""Viva Zapata"".
