1843894,2,B00008G8CZ,"More Hollywood than Holmes, 1 Dec 2007

1932's A Study in Scarlet is a creaky Sherlock Holmes movie shot in California with a predominantly American cast and only a passing relation to the novel. Reginald Owen just about gets by as Holmes, but he's an insufferable know-all in the script who makes pronouncements of guilt without ever once being required to explain the deductions that led to them: people just blindly accept his word because, well, he's Sherlock Holmes. Anna May Wong at her worst makes for a poor femme fatale, Warburton Gamble makes an anonymous Watson and even Alan Mowbray, playing sober for a change, isn't able to liven up Lestrade. Eminently missable, especially in this ropey public domain DVD transfer.",1198886400,,729,4.975409836065574
1843895,4,B00008G8CZ,"A Study In Scarlet the film has very little to do with the novel of the same name. On it's own merits though it is a highly enjoyable classic mystery film. There are plenty of twists and atmosphere and I greatly enjoyed Reginald Owens as Holmes. Owens may take some time to get used to if you are used to Rathbone or Brett. He's different, unique, and exquisite in his own way. I love this movie!",1144972800,10,396,4.223684210526316
1843896,4,B00008G8CZ,"The movie is so old it is at times almost faded out, but the story itself is rather interesting. The plot of the story has been used in many things including an episode of the Simpsons. It's the beauty of Holmes stories, as the story progresses, it's as if you are Holmes trying to figure out who did what and who didn't.

I think that anyone that enjoys a good mystery with an interesting plot, you'll like this even if you aren't yet a fan of the great detective Sherlock Holmes. For a low price, it's worth it.",1138838400,2,513,4.23469387755102
1843897,3,B00008G8CZ,"This is an odd duck of a Sherlock Holmes film. Anyone who knows the first thing about Holmes knows that A Study in Scarlet was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first story about the Great Detective, so it's only natural that this early film (1933) would bring that story to life - but it doesn't, as this Study in Scarlet has very little in common with Doyle's published story. The really odd thing about this film, though, is Holmes' address, which is 221A Baker Street rather than 221B Baker Street. A pre-Scrooge Reginald Owen doesn't make for a bad Sherlock (but he does make for a plump one), although he comes up woefully short against the likes of Basil Rathbone and the incomparable Jeremy Brett. I should note that this is Owen's one and only appearance as Holmes - and, somewhat ironically, it came a year after he played Dr. Watson opposite Clive Brooks' Sherlock Holmes.

This is a fairly standard pastiche affair. You've got this secret little society calling itself the Scarlet Ring, and it's clearly up to no good. Holmes first hears of it when the widow of one of its members seeks his help after seeing her dead husband's estate turned over to the group, leaving her with nothing. Apparently, the group's leader, smarmy lawyer Thaddeus Merrydew (Alan Dinehart), has been in Holmes' sights for some time, and he is eager to finally nab him. In a way, it's a race against time because members of the Scarlet Ring keep turning up dead under suspicious circumstances. Holmes does his investigation (including a little undercover work in disguise), figures everything out, and - in the end - explains it all to Watson and the rest of us. That explanation includes some pretty big facts that we had no possible way of knowing on our own, though, and that never sets too well with me.

With shadowy killers, secret passages, coded messages, and a blonde damsel in distress, this Study in Scarlet makes for a perfectly adequate little mystery - but neither the film nor Reginald Owen truly captures the essence or carries the aura of vintage Sherlock Holmes. And poor Dr. Watson (Warburton Gamble) might as well be a piece of furniture, as he serves almost no purpose in the film.",1134864000,4,2181,4.706806282722513

The film is old and creaky and refuses the high psychological logic of Sherlock Holmes' perfect science in a few apparent plot holes, but the supporting cast is exceptional, and although star Reginald Owen's Sherlock leans a little closer to Perry Mason, he quite fits the shoes of the famed detective.",1109462400,4,430,5.070422535211268
1843900,3,B00008G8CZ,"This 1933 B&W film, which clocks at 72 minutes, not the 77 stated on the box, is enjoyable as an early example of a Sherlock Holmes movie. However, the video and sound quality are rather iffy. The print is fuzzy and of low contrast, whereas the sound track has a loud continuous background noise that sometimes makes the characters hard to understand.
  The movie features Reginald Owen as Holmes, who had starred as Watson in a 1932 film, and who would star as Scrooge in the 1938 film A Christmas Carol. Owen does a decent speaking job as Holmes but visually jars as he is by far the chubbiest Holmes on screen. Warburton Gamble plays a undistinguished, at times whining (due to the cold) Watson. The film is also of interest because of its 1933-vintage costumes and settings. There are two obvious goofs: Holmes's digs are at 221A Baker Street instead of 221B, and the bungling Scotland Yard inspector is Lastrade instead of Lestrade.
  The story has nothing to do with the Arthur Conan Doyle study of the same name. Rather, the movie deals with a mysterious secret trust, the Scarlet Ring. Its members progressively die off, accompanied by a nursery rhyme--and then there were five, four, .... Agatha Christie borrowed this motif in her 1939 mystery novel (and later a play), Ten Little Niggers (American titles: Ten Little Indians, And Then There Were None), which, curiously, has a character named Owen.",1077321600,26,1409,4.809917355371901

1844046,3,B00008G8CZ,"This is a DVD-R film a Sherlock Holmes adventure ""suggested by a novel"" by A.C. Doyle.

Murders that are made to look like suicide.  A secret society that collects from its murdered members.  A sly lawyer who masterminds the ""Scarlet Ring"".  Made easy by a defector or two, Holmes solves the case but with some sleight of hand that keeps the viewer wanting more.  The end is not that obvious and not that 'elementary.'

There are no special features nor any scene selection for this 1933 film.  The film is cleaned up but you can still hear the scratches and the lousy sound quality from the original film.  The acting is overall pedestrian, no one really gets overly excited.  Interesting to have a Chinese actress in it, as well as a blonde whose recently murdered father may have known more than he expected.

A bit of cloak and dagger, not the best Holmes film nor the best Holmes actor, but should be enjoyable to the rabid Holmes' fan.

Moreover, the audio and video are of very low quality.

Although this dvd was cheap at $4.50, I'd regard it as over-priced.  Better to wait for the move to appear on TCM or get a re-mastered version of the dvd and than spend your money on such a poor product as this.  Too bad because the storyline does have some interesting twists and turns.

1844108,4,B00008G8CZ,"Criminals in Sir Conan Doyle's stories are rather simple people, not because they are simple but because the world that is imagining them is simple. Victorian and then Georgian England did not like complicated problems. These two stories are typical of that style in two different directions. ""A Study in Scarlet"" is a love affair that turns sour because two young men abduct the young woman and she is forced to marry one of them, till she dies of real death as much as of sadness. Then vengeance produces the crime. These stories are so simple that we know from the start what it is about, but the interest is in the details and the intricate way the details are revealed for us to be misled and to just accept to follow the lead. Doctor Watson is there to be the bait and the ploy, or even the decoy, so that we fall in the trap. Then add some disguises, some night darkness, some lamps, some transvestites and some other rather weird and somber things and situations and you have it all. And you fall. The police is dumb, I mean Scotland Yard of course, and Sherlock Holmes is a genius, who survives on cocaine, though they forget to tell you that. The ""Study in Scarlet"" introduces another element that Conan Doyle used all the time: the American criminal who of course disturbs the mind of our Scotland Yard protectors because they are different and work with another logic. If they had a Queen, these Americans, they would have found a way to finally have a black Prince of Wales, or at least Princess of the same place. The second short film, The Boscombe Valley Mystery introduces another favorite theme of Sherlock Holmes's. The colonial empire, and in that case Australia. Some people back from there are settling their accounts with blackmail, arguments, violence, vengeance, forced marriages and unofficial affairs, and all that to capture a fortune on one side with a lot of greed along with it and to hide some devious ways used to make that fortune on the other side. In other words they are playing black Jack at twenty-one hundred hours on the pontoon of life and death between here and there. And it takes Sherlock Holmes, some cigar ashes - sorry cigarettes are still not quite in the fad - and a footprint to find out who is the black sheep in the pack. Funny suspense and amusing little secrets, that are at least as difficult to get out of the retainer of them as it would be to undress a nude man. Sherlock Holmes has his own ways to tickle people when they have an itchy spot.

1844109,2,B00008G8CZ,"** There's a spoiler in the second paragraph, be warned **

First be warned that this Alpha Video transfer isn't very good at all; I checked it against the copy that appears on the ""Mystery Classics"" 50-pack for Mill Creek - a company notorious for their poor-quality dupe copies - and it's not any better than the version on that set.  This is scratchy, indistinct and fuzzy at times, with poor sound and lots of noticeable dialog dropout. So it's conceivable that a better print would make some difference in my feelings.

Not likely though. Overall this is one of, if not the, poorest Holmes films I've seen - the John Barrymore silent from a decade earlier is probably it's closest competition.  A large part of the problem rests in the casting of Reginald Owen who is not only physically wrong - a jowly, double-chinned Holmes just doesn't work - but also just plain irritating and seemingly uninterested in the character. I'm sure the screenplay has a lot to do with things also, as it makes out Holmes to be more of a super-cop than anything else, and every time he explains (in even more exasperated tones than is usual for the character) his miraculous sleuthing it comes off as talking down to both his fellow police and Watson, and to us the audience. Of course, Holmes is supposed to be arrogant - but here it's a sort of flip arrogance - hard to explain exactly, but it just seems both perfunctory and unnecessary. And having Holmes shoot one of the bad guys in the back at the end -- that didn't work at all.

The plot has little to do with the novel from which it takes its name; here Holmes is on the trail of a murderer slowly killing off members of some secret society which is only revealed in nature at the end but which we can figure out very early on.  The whole Mormon backstory and flashback nature of the novel is gone - apparently there were worries about alienating people at the time; this is after all a Hollywood, not a British production which could conceivably have been more daring.  Everything feels very by-the-numbers, the rest of the actors aren't really interesting either except for Anna May Wong as the femme fatale who brings at least a little eroticism and enthusiasm to her part.  Director Edwin L. Marin is best known for a number of quite solid Randolph Scott westerns made between 1946 and his death in 1951, and some well-regarded if slightly obscure films noir; he doesn't show a whole lot of talent in this, his second film.

All in all, there's little to recommend this except to the Holmes fanatic who has to see it all.  It would be lovely if some enterprising company would put together a cleaned-up set of the four extant films featuring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, produced at the same time period as this film (1931-37) but in Britain - and this would be worth having as an extra on such a set I suppose.  The Wontner films aren't great, but they're more fun than this one and alas the extant video copies are just as poor.  No Rathbone, perhaps, but all of these early versions deserve some acknowledgement, and it's clear that the character can still bring in the box office in 2010.",1265760000,2,3139,4.536283185840708
1844110,1,B00008G8CZ,i am always interested in Anna May Wong and bought this for her presence. The sets acting and writing are bottom of the barrel. if this is the best that wong could act the limits on her career werenn't all racial. Skip this,1245715200,,223,4.209302325581396
1844111,3,B00008G8CZ,"A true MUST for Anna May WONG fans. Although she has few lines, and a very limited screen time as her usual dragon lady, this PRE-CODE movie offers many good details that makes this movie 5 STARS for Wong fans....SEE! Wong smoke a cigarello while viewed from inside a fireplace. SEE! Wong dressed in a nightgown while making a pass at another woman. SEE! Wong completely wasted in this movie with a cast of two dozen.
This movie is a BIG MISTAKE for any Sherlock HOLMES fans. SEE! perhaps the worst Holmes characterization in film history!  The awful insipid actor playing Holmes here is no match for Wong, who has second billing yet with only minimal material to work with. Of course WONG takes over the screen whenever she appears, and here she appears in the great bonus of terrific costumes..various depression era western rich woman's couture, and is simply stunning. The film itself has a startling high quality opening scene of which Hitchcock himself would be most proud, and a few good angel shots scattered through out the movie to help raise this short poverty row ""14 day shoot"" film to a keeper for Wong fans. However, as I am a Holmes fan as well, for me, repeat viewings willall  include many fast forwards, as I would estimate that Wong sadly appears in only about 5% of the movie, which means that the opening scene, and Wong's appearances is all that is worth repeat viewings..but they add up to this DVD being very very well worth inclusion with your Wong section of your DVD library.  THE QUALITY of the non-restored film was much higher than expected, and it is a very viewable DVD.  Because of it's tiny market share, do not expect to ever find a better copy.  I remain, still hoping for a restored full version of Shanghai Express.",1199664000,7,1754,4.627009646302251

A train arrives in Victoria Station, the door to one compartment cannot be opened, nor the window. There is a dead man inside! A newspaper column has a coded message. A man and a woman visit a house. This group tells about another death. Miss Forester is a visitor. A woman visits Baker Street, she is Murphys widow, and wants what is rightfully hers. Merrydew the lawyer ends the meeting. He advises a woman not to marry for now. A man is shot dead! Merrydew steps outside, that young woman screams and faints when she sees a man. That body has disappeared. Later the police find a floater. The face was battered, Capt. Pike was identified by a ring. Sherlock Holmes inspects the letters found on the body, then talks to the widow. She has a lawyer. A man receives a coded message. There is a shot.

Was there a motive for Pikes murder? [No gloves used when handling evidence.] Trace evidence? It was a man, says Sherlock. There were two shots, the second to make it look like a suicide. Holmes and Watson visit Merrydew to tell about Malcolm Dearing. What was in that note? Can an almanac decipher that message? Merrydew visits Miss Forester. So does John. Who was that bearded man in the garden? Is he a threat to Miss Forester? Sherlock says she must be watched. The Pike Grange is up for sale. A stranger arrives to look over the house. He taps the walls. When he visits Pikes bedroom he calls for water, then a doctor! When the servant leaves he explores the house. A secret passage to the river? Widow Pike has a visitor. Holmes put a message in the Daily Telegraph. Two men talk, Merrydew arrives with news of the plunder. Miss Forester arrives for the meeting.

Holmes receives a telephone call, he goes to visit that room. Gas! A man is nearly hit by an auto, he goes to see Holmes, but he is out. Merrydew has a visitor. Holmes questions this visitor, he has almost a chance if he does what he is told. When they leave they find Baker with a message. Later a group of men visit that Inn and order drinks. They are looking for a patient at the Pike Grange. They learn Miss Forester has disappeared. We see where she is. A telegram for Miss Forester. What does it mean? Lock your door and keep it locked. The police surround the Grange. A man talks to Mrs. Pike. Holmes arrives in time, there is a big surprise! Holmes explains how it was done. There is another arrest. Holmes explains his deduction. A ring on a finger for years would leave a mark. The plot was based on a theft of jewelry from the Chines Emperor. Fewer survivors meant a larger share.

This story is a mixture from the original Sherlock Holmes stories. It has little in common with the long story by that name. The group of thieves recalls The Sign of Four. The battered face recalls The Valley of Fear. The coded message recalls The Dancing Men. The quality of the sound and video is poor. Some may object to some words in those messages (like Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians). Note the availability of pistols then. Werent there other stories that used the same plot of a hidden surprise?",1490313600,,3103,4.43859649122807

7982926,2,B00008G8CZ,"Given the time period this movie was made, I made allowences for certain things - delivery of lines, dialogue style, sound/special effects, but despite these allowances this movie has several major issues that has me give it a 2 out of 5 stars. First, there is a horrible background/foreground noise, like a continuous rain on the tin roof of a warehouse tudio. Second and purely as a fan of Doyle's Homes, the characterization of Sherlock Holmes feels like a cheap dime store silhouette not the rich personality Doyle had created, albeit over several novels and dozens of short stories. Third and again as a fan, Doyle's ""The Study in Scarlet"" is one of the most referred to and most often badly adulterated or just plain misrepresented title/work and it is true in this instance. This movie has no relation to the original work other than the mention of ""square toed shoes"", and rather has bits taken from a half dozen other works scattered through as Easter eggs for fans to pick out. Fourth, a quality work, be it film or book or music needs to stand the test of time and this film seems to fail that test for ""classic"" status and is not a movie I would return to.",1485648000,,1168,4.566666666666666
