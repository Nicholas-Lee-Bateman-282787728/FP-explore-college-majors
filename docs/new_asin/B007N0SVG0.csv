5099992,5,B007N0SVG0,"I think so. It's a personal opinion of course. But, for me Richter's manner and musicality have always been something I've been drawn to. My awareness of him was with the first notes of the 'Pictures' recital recording in Sofia in 1958, through to his sublime Schubert near the end of his life, Richter had it all. We should be grateful for the many recordings of this amazing performer, if not for the uneven quality of some of them. But I am most grateful to Monsaingeon for this amazing film. I own it as a VHS, but no longer have a VHS player, so the DVD is a most welcome arrival! Monsaingeon is as much a genius as a film-maker as his subject was as a musician. The result is a perfect match. There was no more extraordinary life than Richter's, no more completely exciting personality as a pianist than his, no more devastatingly demonic virtuoso than he. Possibly Liszt was like this.  But Liszt didn't have the pianos of today, and anyway I cannot imagine a Liszt or anyone transcending Richter. There maybe pianists whose skill was equal--Cziffra, Horowitz and Berezofsky are close, but no one was as completely and spiritually connected to music as Richter. It's a great film about a uniquely gifted original whose likes we won't see again!",1364515200,15,1251,4.635135135135135
5099993,5,B007N0SVG0,"This DVD is an absolute treasure.  I stumbled on a section of the video on YouTube and had to have the whole thing. However, a few months back it was not available on DVD; only VHS. I kept checking back and and was pleasantly surprised to find the DVD on Amazon.

I had heard of Richter before but somehow, I did not realize how great he really was. The film artfully integrates interviews with Richter with clips of various concerts and rehearsals. Richter's playing is astounding! I can't believe it took me so long to discover this legendary genius.

I have never written a review on Amazon but felt compelled to write this one. Buy this DVD without hesitation, you will love it! Bruno Monsaingeon has created another masterpiece and an enduring testamanent to arguably the greatest pianist of the 20th century.",1356480000,19,814,4.71830985915493
5099994,5,B007N0SVG0,"I,too, have waited years for this to be available. Other then getting an old vcr copy transferred onto disc,or watching bits of it on Youtube or on Medicitv,it is enthralling to finally have this available. Richter loathed being filmed,the amount of footage of him available[so far,who knows what is in the archives?} is scant,so Bruno Massignon accommodated him by using only a small, unobtrusive camera, and let Richter talk. Who was the greatest pianist of the century?Does it really matter?Richter in on any short list, we have hundreds of his recordings and this gorgeous film by Massignon. Richter ,though old and frail,does not let us into his private life,which,for me, is fine. Frankly,I do not care. His music, the wondrous touch he played with can almost stop time. And there are plenty of these moments interspersed throughout this film.  As good as anything we are likely to ever get on this,yes, genius[he literally memorized every score he ever played,not just a mnemonic trick,by the way].Wonderful!",1350432000,26,1015,5.151515151515151
5099995,5,B007N0SVG0,"We've waited at least five years for this dvd format. We were spellbound by the biographical information, excerpts of Richter's playing, and visual clips. Although tempted to convert our VHS, we bought this reissue to support those who invested time & money to make this available to US viewers.",1348012800,15,295,5.040816326530612
8519597,5,B007N0SVG0,I have seen several movies about Richter and this one did not disappoint.,1509926400,,73,4.6923076923076925
8519598,4,B007N0SVG0,A lengthy portrait of a strange introspective man obsessed with his work. I enjoyed it.,1454112000,,87,4.866666666666666
8519599,5,B007N0SVG0,"The DVD is remarkable on all counts. Not only is Sviatoslav Richter one of the towering figures of classical piano of the twentieth century, but he has a compelling personal story and the movie alternates between interview segments and archival footage of Richter displaying the most stunning, jaw-dropping mastery at the piano that I have ever witnessed. The movie will make you care about Richter the man, admire Richter the pianist, and go straight to your favorite music store (online or not) to purchase his recordings. The word ""genius"" is overused these days, but Richter is one of the few who clearly deserves it. I would give this DVD ten stars if I could.",1448496000,6,665,4.842105263157895
8519600,5,B007N0SVG0,Such a massively inspiring film and I have gathered up a lot of his recorded music as a result of this wonderful documentary.,1447459200,,125,4.478260869565218

8519602,5,B007N0SVG0,"Fascinating insights into this great player and the milieu of Soviet musicians. Richter , however and a man unto himself.",1384473600,,121,5.1
8519603,5,B007N0SVG0,"I knew Richter only through his recordings, but those were more than enough for me to want to hear this man speak, give opinions, show his thought processes, and to know his history as he relates it.  This set is a must have for any serious lover of the piano literature and its history.",1383350400,5,287,4.314814814814815
8519604,4,B007N0SVG0,"Richter was one of the greatest pianists of all time, but he liked his privacy and was publicity shy.  Shortly before he died, he gave interviews to a French documentary film maker who put together a fascinating story of his Richter's life with riveting commentaries by some of his fellow artists.  I SUGGEST THAT YOU READ SOMETHING ABOUT RICHTER BEFORE YOU VIEW THIS VIDEO.",1370217600,3,374,4.828125
8519605,5,B007N0SVG0,"This man was a genius and a very interesting person. Watching his life unfold through his own words is fascinating, even hypnotizing. His playing was unique and insightful while being honest to the spirit and intentions of the composer.",1365984000,2,236,5.076923076923077
8519606,5,B007N0SVG0,"Everyone interested in Sviatoslav Richter, piano or even classical music in general will be pleased with this documentary. It tells the story of Richter, one of the best pianists ever, in more or less chronological order. It is told by his friends and colleagues, but mostly by himself, both in words and in music. The words are remarkably Spartan, the music is brilliant. A beautiful insight into an enigma, finally available on DVD.",1365638400,5,434,4.958904109589041
