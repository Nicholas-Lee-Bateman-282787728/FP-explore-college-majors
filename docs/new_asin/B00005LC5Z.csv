1620815,5,B00005LC5Z,"It is an excellent movie about the stigma against those with severe mental illnesses and that is the real horror. IT is not your usual horror movie. Charlie is treated like garbage by the ""normal"" people around him. To me, that is the real ""horror"". I suggest it be seen by advocates for those with mental illnesses and anyone interested in helping the mentally ill. Do not expect this movie to be your usual horror movie though. I think it is excellent.",1375747200,,454,4.548780487804878
1620816,2,B00005LC5Z,"I found this movie for $2.00 at a place that was going out of business so I bought it because the cover looked good and it had a lot of good comments on the case. First off let me say if you picked this movie up expecting to see a good Thriller/Scary movie you will be disappointed because it is not the least bit scary. But I don't think it was intended to be scary, it focuses more on the mind of the lead character, and what he struggles with.

Summary:
The story is about a guy named Charlie Cavenaugh who is an ex-mental patient with a dark violent past. Throughout the film, Charlie tries desperately to pull his life back together after the murder of his family which was committed by his own father. Charlie lives by himself in a small apartment in Southern California. He works and tries to fight his violent ""urges"" everyday to avoid being sent back to a mental hospital. As the story progresses Charlie begins dreaming about the spirit of a woman who killed herself in his apartment. Every time Charlie goes to sleep, he dreams of her and eventually begins to believe that she is actually real. The woman tries to develop some kind of ""Love"" relationship with Charlie in his dreams and at the same time urges him to give in to his urge to kill.

The story of the character Charlie is what kept me watching. How he constantly fights his urges and tries to act normal. Kirk Harris is by far the best actor in the movie and does a very good portrayal of his character. I didn't like how slow this movie was. True, it does get a little more interesting as the film progresses. Right when you start it, you'll notice that the photography in this movie is very low in quality, like it was shot with a digital camera. Overall it's not a bad story, and the acting is mostly good. When I finished watching it I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I guess it's OK for a low budget Independent film, but it wasn't really what I expected it to be. I probably won't watch it again and I don't really recommend it.",1332201600,2,2009,4.28421052631579
1620817,4,B00005LC5Z,"Recently rented this film on a night I just wanted to see something different.  Box looked ok, had a some good reviews.  Truthfully I didn't expect much.  Started off a bit slow, however the journey the lead character goes through soon compelled me to keep watching.  It is a film that literally is about a guy self destructing, trying valiantly not too, but still destruction is coming and the only thing that is in question is how messy it will be, ie mass murder.  The lead actor was simply amazing.  Some of the others actors not so good.  Photography was generally decent.  This has to be the first character study drama that in truth is a horrifying thriller in its own right.",1036886400,5,682,4.532786885245901
1620818,3,B00005LC5Z,"For a first time director (assumption since I wasn't able to find anything else to his credit), I thought this was a really great try. It's difficult to get good actors cheap, which is what appears to have happened to this fairly decent story. I'd like to see what this director could do with a lead character that could actually ""act."" Not to say all the acting is poor, some of the performances are pretty enjoyable. I've watched alot of Independent film and this is not by far the worst.",1025913600,,490,4.455555555555556
1620819,3,B00005LC5Z,"Forget everything but the killer and his mind, because this is the center of the whole movie. Made in a, could I say, theater style, this movie shows the motivations, desires and secrets from one young man living alone surrounded by a (true) ambience, the one perfect for his creative mind work. This movie hides many secrets, could I say, messages, and repeated views would help to understand it. I could tell you more about the drugs, sex and violence this movie portraits, but I will leave it all for you to make your own conclusions.",1010793600,4,537,4.604166666666667
1620820,5,B00005LC5Z,"I really dug the intensity of the lead actor Kirk Harris in this film.  My Sweet Killer looks pretty low budget and has some performances that aren't the best, however the journey of madness that the main character goes through is at once scary and sad.  Harris gives the kind of performance that you would expect from a young Nicholson not a low budget horror flick like this.",996451200,5,377,4.529411764705882

7943610,1,B00005LC5Z,"Seriously, don't waste your time. I managed to watch maybe 15 minutes. The acting was bad and the dialogue was worse. This isn't even good enough for a high school film club submission, much less a commercial movie. The only question is why Amazon has it in their inventory. I'm really, REALLY glad it was free streaming. If I'd paid for this crapola, I would have called and demanded my money back.",1468022400,2,399,4.555555555555555

7943617,5,B00005LC5Z,"Strong cult film.  Terrific performance by Kirk Harris.  Reminds me of Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver.  Another good performance is Clifton Collins in this film who goes by his birth name here Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez.  Edgy and twisted.  Shows you how strange the film business is that both of these actors aren't huge names.  Then again, I would rather watch films like this than most big budget Hollywood comic books ;)",1451174400,,422,4.791666666666667
7943618,1,B00005LC5Z,"Charlie (Kirk Harris) is at a half way house and works at a machine shop. He gets psychiatric help but has trouble sleeping. He dreams and imagines about a girl (Stephanie Knight) who is both his killer and lover. The film centers on Charlie to the exclusion of everything else. I got bored with his act about 20 minutes into the film as things go nowhere.

I don't understand the praise worthy reviews as the film lacked entertainment value, acting, dialouge, and plot. A concept film? Not really, just a bad film looking for an excuse.
