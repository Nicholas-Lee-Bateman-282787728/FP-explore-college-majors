Since the main character (obviously) has anger issues that lands him in all sorts of predicaments, this cartoon might not be suitable for certain US viewers. Otherwise, the cartoon itself is a masterpiece.  It exploits all sorts of human weaknesses and/or stupidity in a funny and extraordinarily amusing way.",1401840000,,374,4.920634920634921
8338944,5,B001RV3O7W,"If your grew up in Europe in the '70s, you'll remember this funny little guy. ""Mmmm, haaa, ta na na nana na"". I thought my 4yo might really enjoy it. I was a little scared of playing a region 2 PAL DVD. Instead  of my DVD player, I ripped the DVD, and converted the movies to my iPhone.
The kid loves them! The simplicity, and emotional range are awesome. Each episode is a 2 minute nugget that I can deal out, precious as candy.",1263427200,6,429,4.107142857142857
