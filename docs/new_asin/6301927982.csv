7816770,3,6301927982,"Wings Hauser gets told he only looks for solutions instead of examining the root of the problem in this film. Wings Hauser's response is to bellow out in manliness ""of course I only look for solutions! I'm a Republican!"" I can't think of a scene that sums up this obvious TV show pilot turned into a movie better than that. It's loud, dismissive of plot, declarative, completely off topic, and pretty funny all at once.

Wings is the best thing about the movie as usual. He was the best thing about The Insider too and should've had Russel Crowe's part. Either way, Wings was in Wilding and I was better for it at least. His scenes are the best. He's full savage here. He breaks into his girlfriends house essentially, tries to get busy with her, she knees him in his wing and then feels bad enough to invite him to stay. Later on, he decides he's had enough and she steals his gun and demands he stays while cocking the hammer. I could've watched their scenes non-stop.

The rest of the movie is equally weird. Honor roll students are going crazy killing and raping people. Nobody knows how to stop it. The leader of the kids has a weird political ethos that they declare pretty regularly. Unfortunately, it's not quite as awesome as Wings doing his thing of giving mullet haired cop ladies a hard time cause he's a 1940s I beat the Nazis kinda guy.

The biggest thing that hurts this movie is that it's clearly meant to be a TV pilot at an hour long. So, they had to include all footage including outtakes to fill the time. It's funny but sad all at once.",1469059200,,1557,4.399305555555555
