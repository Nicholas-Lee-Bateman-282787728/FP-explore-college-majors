8653603,4,0871273055,"My main complaint with this DVD is the packaging.  The DVD I received was not sealed and it was bouncing around in the case.  I complained to Amazon, but I never got a response.  I transferred my original VHS tape of this to DVD---and I was hoping that this
commercial DVD would be an improvement over mine---but it is not.  It is worth having, if only to see Nora Kaye and Hugh Laing.",1324771200,,385,4.232876712328767
