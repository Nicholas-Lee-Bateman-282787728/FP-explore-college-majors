899575,5,630455947X,"If you want to see one of the greatest acting feats of all time, then be sure to see Dame Edith Evans in The Whisperers. Evans, considered the greatest stage actress of her generation, does not disappoint in her only staring role. She won practically everything worth winning, performance wise, leading into the Academy Awards, only to be robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress! Due to politics, Oscar chose Katherine Hepburn, a great actress in her own right, but hardly great in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Hepburn won because Spencer Tracey had died a little after completing the film and they had been lovers for years. I thought this was about acting and I'm sure Hepburn would agree. Interestingly enough, Hepburn won again, the very next year, in a tie with Stiesand for Funny Girl for a GREAT performance in the Lion In Winter. Amazing how often this stuff happens. Anyway, this gives you a chance to see this fantastic piece of work. It's not for everyone. It's a grim and depressing film, but it's realistic and it's something that many will, unfortunately go through at some point in time in their lifetimes.

Edith Evans is mesmerizing as Mrs. Ross. Actually, all of the acting is top floor.

Anthony Harvey handles the editing chores and he would go on to be a director himself, giving John Barry the chance at another Oscar for The Lion in Winter. Gerry Turpin, who provided the photography for all together different Bryan Forbes movie, the enchanting (and colorful) The Wrong Box, details the stark atmosphere of Manchester with deep shadows, lonely rain-drops, and well-framed faces.

899686,5,630455947X,"Wow. I am not sure what to say about this movie. It was done in the tradition of complex 60's British movies, in which there is not much action per se, but much done in the way of creating an atmosphere and story by mood.  A dark and poignant story about the life of an elderly British woman, with a definitive beginning and an end- and much strange ""gadding about"" in between. If you want to see a movie that is mindless and entertaining- this isNOT the movie for you. However, if you want to see a movie that says much, and has an unbelievable performance by Dame Edith Evans, put it on. You have to stay put and hang in there to see the gist, but it is worth it. Highly recommended!!",1454284800,4,686,4.157894736842105
899687,4,630455947X,"It's difficult to recommend a film which is most often described as depressing, downbeat, grim and bleak, and with all of those terms being highly accurate as well. Certainly you have to be in the mood for an English art house film by director Bryan Forbes, known for Seance On a Wet Afternoon, shot in gritty black and white, often at odd angles, in grimy, industrial Manchester, and telling the story of a very poor woman who barely has a grip on reality.

Mrs Ross's days are spent in a rundown, cluttered flat, at the library where she can get warm, at the local Mission church where she can get a meal after a sermon, at the local office of the national assistance Board where she can beg for new shoes or a pound note to get some food, and at the police station where she can complain about the whispers she hears from her water pipes and radio and the neighbors who seem to be against her. This, as little as it is, is her entire life. It is important to not here that we never hear these ""Whisperers"" nor does anything she says clue us in on what they may be saying, beyond, ""I'm on to your tricks"". Though hopelessly poor, she also thinks she is an heiress to a great fortune waiting for her inheritance to arrive. Then a series of events transpires which alters her life in unexpected ways. How she deals with them is the remainder of the film.

Mrs. Ross is played by Dame Edith Evans, completely against type, in an Academy Award nominated performance, a performance that many think she should have won on merit. Much time has passed since this 1967 film, so I will give a little background here for those too young to know her. Edith Evans is generally acclaimed as the greatest actress ever produced by the English stage in the last century. Beginning mostly in Shakespeare, she also was the original St. Joan in the George Bernard Shaw Play, and Shaw wrote The Millionairess for her. She generally played Ladies of the nobility or other upper class women. Yet here she plays this wretchedly poor, addled, delusional old woman so completely and convincingly, that you practically feel you're watching a documentary at times and really feel for her suffering and travails. This is the main reason to see the film; it's truly one of the most remarkable performances ever committed to film. She is supported by an excellent cast and there is not one false note.

I must also warn you that many people hate this film for its bleakness and dark tone, as well as a lack of the big plot elements that one comes to expect in movies. Some come away with the feeling of ""Just what was that all about?' On the other hand, a few don't like the one or two developments that do happen, considering them too unusual and dramatic and wanting a strictly slice of life film, with virtually nothing occurring. I feel they're necessary, but you can decide that for yourself.

THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH< SO READ THIS PART AFTER SEEING THE FILM.

The general view after seeing The Whisperers is that it is a film about how the old are discarded by society, and treated shoddily. Also, that it's a study of a sad and lonely person with no hope who is briefly lifted out of her bleak routine only to be returned to it in all it's loneliness. This is true, but I think there is a way to see the ending as a happy one and a victory for Mrs. Ross. After finding the money and being mugged and subsequently hospitalized, the National Assistance people out of concern, research who she really is and then set her up in a new life, even cleaning up her flat and finding and reuniting her with her ""long lost"" husband. The husband is a philandering, alcoholic bully, and only goes along to get some new clothes and a few extra pounds. In the end he leaves and Mrs. Ross is able to restore her old routine; the Whisperers return as well as her usual circuit of the Mission, and her old seat at the library. As solitary and strange as it was, it was her routine, her way of dealing with life and she had become reconciled to it. In the end she was able to restore her routine after being taken out of it and being put in circumstances not to her liking.",1444521600,15,4153,4.409387222946545

I think the feel of England, with the old style row homes and little markets and what not are how I like to think of that country. The modern day version of Great Britain is just not so endearing or historic feeling.
The main character is played quite believably a she deals with the loneliness of old age, and the fact that the people around her have marginalized her into a pigeonhole stereotype of a useless old woman.
I liked this movie quite a bit, though it may not sit well with many viewers, this type of movie stands head and shoulders above most of the tripe Hollywood sloughs out these days.

899765,4,630455947X,"This was very much a film of its time.  It's not an action film or a suspense as we would expect today, but is something of a film noir in the '60s style.  If you can relax and let the story happen, it's entertaining.  The final point of the film was made more clear in the Wikipedia plot writeup, which solidified it for me.  It was a little slow in coming on its own because there were scenes in the film that left me a little confused and I wasn't always quite sure what had happened.

899810,5,630455947X,I love this movie because it is bittersweet it is something that makes you appreciate the things that you have as in comparison to the things that you wish you had.. It also makes you feel the reality of what happens two elderly people. In this film Edith Evans does an excellent job portraying Margaret Ross. it seems to me that God in heaven looks out for this woman regardless of her circumstances he looks out for her. She's smart but yet senile at the same time and then very very careless and naive when it comes to Bella and allowing her to literally force and manipulate her into going out for a pork and sausage and then to Bella's house where she finally realizes that she has been set up to be robbed but it is too late because she finally passes out. She gets robbed once again probably several times when her husband comes back into her life. Her husband is an awesome scoundrels he is very intelligent very well mannered and well put together I like her husband and I'm happy that he got away in the end to live his life the way that he wants it is apparent that he has been unhappy with her and that was why he left which was definitely wrong on his part he should not have married her in the first place he purposely set out to marry an older woman and then when things BK more than he could bear he just walked out shame on him for that but also at the end with all the little Parks and grooves that was made during a movie which I couldn't help but laugh at there was some very funny moments but like I was saying at the end she cleaned up that house her flat she cleaned it up again she got herself together she cleaned up that house she went down to speak to Mr Conrad at national assistance and she's a different person and a better person and she did not hear the whisperers anymore she knows now that she can make it on her own as before not realizing that she was actually making it on her own do a degree I was proud of her at the end the house was clean she was dressed what I didn't get it was and I hope someone can help me with this her son went to prison for stealing that money but who was the person that the police officer was referring to when he was speaking to Mr Conrad in the hospital when he said that we know who did it they confessed and etc. who confessed cause I know that that family didn't confess Charlie may have confessed for stealing the money but who confessed to what happened to misses Ross,1403568000,,2442,4.121593291404612

899812,5,630455947X,"The title of this surprisingly fantastic film may make one assume that they are about to experience something dark and disturbing, in a supernatural way, but `The Whisperers' disturbs in a very different and possibly more effective way than that.  Telling the story of a lonely old woman at the end of her rope with fantasies playing over and over in her head and a band of thieves `so-to-speak', waiting to take advantage of her; `The Whisperers' details the horrific decline of the disadvantaged and speaks to a large array of issues that still plague society today.

Margaret Ross is a seventy-six year old woman, abandoned by her husband and used up by her son who is basically wasting away in a worn down flat.  She borrows what little money she can to get by, clutters her home with things she doesn't need, and entertains the fantasy that she is aristocracy and is waiting for her money to come in.  When her delusions are fed by her son's thieving ways, Mrs. Ross finds herself on the road to a better life, until a brief conversation leads to extra hands in her purse and she finds herself tossed aside (quite literally) and reunited with her philandering husband, quick to use her for what little she has left.

There is no happy ending here, only the bleak realities of poverty, but that doesn't mean that this film is void of merit (for it is that honest depiction that gives it the strongest merit).  Dame Edith Evans gives a phenomenal turn as the disillusioned old woman.  She talks with an air of arrogance that befits her delusions and she glosses her eyes over with the fears of a woman overwhelmed by what isn't really there (she hears whispers in the silence).  The way that she completely breaks down this woman's every layer is breathtaking.  Her Oscar nomination was well deserved, and quite frankly, I'm tempted to say she should have won!  The supporting cast is also very good, but Evans is the chief focal point for sure.

Bryan Forbes deserves to be singled out with praise for the delicate and yet brutally honest way he directed this film.  He coaxed so much honesty out of every frame, keeping us completely enwrapped in this woman's miserable plight.",1377907200,2,2182,4.668407310704961

I see it as an older woman myself.  When I first saw it, she seemed 'so old'.  Now, it's scary, it makes me hold my breath..  I love it because I love that British era, the black and white filming, the compassion of the main social worker, the caring of the system there compared to the quickness of the system here readying to 'put one in a 'place'''  .....  I love them willing to let her stay in her own home.  People don't understand that for many older people, it may seem not good enough, but for them... it's theirs and that is paramount.

899815,2,630455947X,"Maggie Ross is a 76 year old (although she looks 96) woman ""on the dole"" in London. She claims to have many titles after her name and have come from a wealthy family, and just fallen on hard times (as she married beneath her). She's just waiting for her inheritence from her late father's estate. Her son is no good, and her shiftless husband abandoned her and neither bothered to get a divorce. She collects a lot of old newspapers in case she wants to read the articles again. One whole room is filled with newspapers and books. Mrs. Ross goes to see the welfare men (it's always men) pretty frequently and requests some new shoes. The welfare men keep cash in the desk drawers which they hand out in certain cases (not hers). Although it's summer, she always wears a coat (as do most of the characters), and when she goes to the library, she has a certain spot to sit and take off a shoe and rest her foot on a pipe, which I guess hot water runs through. They frown upon this at the library however.

Her middle-aged son comes to visit her, but what he wants is a place to hide his stash of money. He gives his mom a little money and she is delighted. Of course she immediately finds the money (pretty dumb of him) and thinks it's her just reward or something. For some reason, she feels the need to take this money in her wallet (although realistically, I don't see how it could fit because it was quite a bundle - did she leave some of it behind and it was stolen from her apt?), down to the welfare office and tell them she no longer will be needing their assistance. While she's in line, she has to blab all about it to a sneaky-looking, chubby woman anyone can see is up to no good. The woman invites her for a drink, they ride a bus for a LONG time, finally get there, then have to go to the woman's home, also quite a ways away, where she yells at her lazy kids and knuckles under to a lazy but bossy husband. Anyone could have seen from the moment Mrs. Ross began talking with the chubby woman what was going to happen, so they might as well have skipped all this. JUST TAKE HER MONEY AND BE DONE WITH IT. But, no, we have to go through all this long, drawn-out rigamarole. So Mrs. Ross passes out from alcohol, and although she is presumably miles and miles away from her apartment, it shows the son and husband physically carrying her and dropping her near her abode, where she quite easily could have died if not found.

However, she was found, and put in the hospital where she slowly recovers from pneumonia. The doctor tells the welfare man that she is quite an interesting case, that she used to be a domestic in a wealthy home (the closest she came to wealth). That's what would have made the movie - if they had told her story and how she came to think she was practically royalty. But they don't.  Most of the story is about how she got her money stolen. Opened her mouth when she shouldn't, got on the bus, traveled, etc. That wasn't interesting.

The acting was great and Edith Evans is totally believable as the elderly lady quite set in her ways, deluded about some things but not about others.

899817,4,630455947X,"For the first half of ""The Whisperers"" it's pretty good going.  It serves as a great depiction of what it's like to be of advanced age in a slum existence.  Edith Evans is a wonder to behold as Margaret Ross, an elderly woman who suffers from dementia and probably Alzheimers.  This is a very subtle turn by Evans and she doesn't overplay it in the least.  Small touches like looking into a frayed hand mirror to show the ravages of time on her physical and mental being or even the creases on her face to demonstrate her fragility.  Director Bryan Forbes frames her situation perfectly with stunning black-and-white photography and evocative slum production design.  The film takes a near calamatous turn when Margaret falls into a cache of money.  It's at that point where the film doesn't know where to go.  We're introduced to Margaret's ne'er-do-well husband Archie(Eric Portman) and then devolves into a ho-hum gangster story.

She also copes with abandonment,lonliness, and predators who take advantage of her naivety.

899865,5,630455947X,"""The Whisperers"" deserves an astute audio commentary, something that is becoming increasingly rare on the DVDs of bonafide classic films.

Edith Evans' against-type portrayal of the desperately lonely and demented old woman in ""The Whisperers"" is arguably the single greatest performance by any woman in any movie.",1280793600,9,314,5.680851063829787
899866,5,630455947X,"Dame Edith is astonishing here. How the Oscar went to Hepburn is one of the greatest travesties in the Academy's history. Never has there been a more heartbreaking, realistic yet unsentimental portrayal of a lonely elderly person.  The performance rightly won Best Actress from:  The New York Film Critics, The National Board of Review, The Venice Film Festival, The Hollywood Foreign Press (Best Actress, Drama), and the BAFTA. This Bryan Forbes directed film deserves far better than the DVD-R release it gets here, but it is better than nothing.  Also notable is the haunting score and bleak b&w cinematography. 4 stars.",1271376000,29,623,5.148514851485149
899867,5,630455947X,"In the late 1960s, I was in the U.S. Navy stationed onboard a submarine tender in Holy Loch, Scotland.  One weekend I went down to London and saw ""The Whisperers"".  I was completely engrossed and captivated by Edith Evans' performance.  Half way through the film, however, I had to leave the theatre due to a oncoming cold.  It was not until more than 40 years later that I was able to see the complete film, and I still consider it to be the best British movie of that era.  London may then have been the center of the ""Swinging 60s,"" but it was also drab and cold and at times depressing.  ""The Whisperers"" perfectly captures the ""other"" side of Mod London.  See it.",1256601600,15,668,4.382113821138211
899868,3,630455947X,"Dame Edith Evans has perhaps her best movie role as Maggie Ross, a 76-year-old British woman who lives in a small flat and collects assistance.  Maggie has paranoid delusions -- she thinks that there are people communicating with her through her water pipes, that the woman living upstairs is a slave being held captive, and that people are watching her.  She also believes that she is an heiress whose inheritance has been delayed.  When her ne'er do well son stops by for a rare visit and hides some ill-gotten money in her flat, Maggie finds it and thinks that it's her inheritance, which triggers a series of unfortunate events.

""The Whisperers"" is all Dame Evan's show.  Her performance perfectly captures the confusion, fear, and loneliness of her character.  She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, losing to Katharine Hepburn, and she won the same award at the Golden Globes.  I also think the movie pretty accurately portrays dementia, although that word is never explicitly used.  Unfortunately, that's the highlight of ""The Whisperers.""  It's a depressing movie without any humor, and the other characters are largely without redeeming qualities, making the movie rather slow going and unpleasant.  I can't say that I enjoyed the movie.  Nevertheless, the film is worth a look for Evan's performance; I can also imagine the movie being used in classes dealing with dementia.  ""The Whisperers"" isn't available yet on DVD; a situation I hope the movie studio will remedy soon.",1230768000,6,1504,5.044534412955466
899869,4,630455947X,I loved this movie. Edith Evans is wonderful in it. The plot is low-key but just sit back and marvel at Evans. She dominates the screen with a very powerful performance. The supporting cast is equally fine. Bryan Forbes did a great job of directing and adapting the novel that the movie was based on.  Evans really should have won the Best Actress Oscar for this movie. She was robbed.,1200700800,2,385,4.5
899870,4,630455947X,"Known for her flamboyant Restoration comedy stage (and occasional screen) performances, Edith Evans in this film gives a small, detailed performance of social realism, completely unsentimental and without vanity, that is one of the best 60s 'kitchen sink' dramas on film. It is not a movie about a woman sitting in a room hearing voices all day, as the title and description will usually lead you to believe. It is a moving, lively and sad depiction of old age without money, and the fumbling ineffectiveness of the social welfare system to help; an English equivalent of Gorky's 'The Lower Depths'. It could use a touch of Chechov's compassionate humor. Evans was nominated for an Oscar and lost to Katherine Hepburn for her rather smug performance in 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'. Pity. Evans, who could be quite glamorous, is entirely without vanity here. If she were an American, you would hear this performance talked about in hushed tones at the Actor's Studio.",1090886400,35,969,4.987654320987654

from being ridiculous to tedious to foolishly sad.  Her character

7874279,5,630455947X,"Dame Edith Evans is spectacular in this old black & white flick set in the slums of an earlier era of England. It's a tale of being elderly & dependent upon society for aid. An elderly lady is taken advantage of in her ""alone"" years. It's about survival in one's later years portray of a bleak world for the character, Mrs. Ross, who lives in the past awaiting a better life that never arrives. It is true she has a younger husband who is influenced by caring people in the social systems of the times, to be a husband, but that doesn't go as planned. It's heart-warming to see the loving care of hospital staff & those employed within the social system of the times, who see to the needs of the indigent; they really care, but after all is said & done the ending is not as I'd expected. Perhaps the young viewer might not prefer this type of film, but it's a great film of learning about the elderly & the future. A very thought-provoking film one does need to view & remember",1494028800,3,977,4.286486486486487
