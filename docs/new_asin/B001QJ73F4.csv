3765509,3,B001QJ73F4,"I had a hard time choosing between two stars and three stars. My two year old daughter is a huge fan of ""Wow Wow"" (As she calls it). I saw this in a store so I picked it up for her.

I was slightly disappointed though, because there are only two episodes on this DVD that aren't on the first 3 Wubbzy DVDs that I purchased before this. Still, it's a cute idea, but I wish the creators wouldn't have cheaped out.",1244678400,6,411,4.012195121951219

3765519,3,B001QJ73F4,I bought this for my girls to watch in the car because they LOVE wubsy!!  It is about 70 minutes long and just runs back to back episodes from this season. Not really a movie. It was a disappointing buy because I already own some of the season DVD's.,1321747200,,250,4.1020408163265305

3765522,5,B001QJ73F4,My kids love this DVD. They watch it over and over again. It is basically a conglomeration of Wubbzy shows. It keeps their attention with short stories.,1283644800,,152,4.666666666666667

3765527,5,B001QJ73F4,This is a great all-in-one DVD. We have many showed DVR'd but to have them on a DVD together makes long car rides much better :) It was worth the price (I got it for a bit more at Target) since the story keeps playing and my Little One very happy :),1254528000,,249,3.8076923076923075
3765528,4,B001QJ73F4,"Wubbzy and pals are just too cute to dislike.  Although this movie was just a combo of episodes within a movie, it is a 70 minute movie nonetheless and provides much entertainment for my son rather that the 20-22 min episodes.  It's cute and fun and even I don't mind watching it more than once.",1253404800,,295,4.345454545454546
3765529,4,B001QJ73F4,"There is some original footage which is shown between the episodes from the TV Show.

The plot of the ""movie"" is Wubbzy loses his memory, so Walden and Widget try to help him remember by talking about some of the fun adventures they've had.  It's like a ""clip show"" from other TV shows.

I bought this for my son who loves Wubbzy, and he was very happy.",1249603200,,353,4.2388059701492535
3765530,2,B001QJ73F4,"My son who is a year and a half now loves Wow Wow Wubbzy. He requests the show by name. He has Wubbzy toys and all the DVDs. So when this came out I preordered it arrive day one since the other DVDs see a lot of screen time. When we popped it in I was expecting a new tale of Wubbzy's adventures. But to my dismay, I found a bunch of episodes stringed together through a side story. Basically Wubbzy has lost his memory and trough a series of ""flashbacks"" aka full length episodes he regains his memories. Two or more of the episodes are recycled from the other already released DVDs. So you are paying 10 bucks for 2 episodes you haven't seen on DVD before. Not to mention it's only 77 minutes long, making it exactly 1 episode shorter than the other DVDs minus the bonus episodes...
All in all it's still a good DVD. I'm still amazed at the picture quality the Wubbzy DVDs come in. Sound is what you would come to expect with these type of DVDs. However, quality aside, this sort of thing isn't really worth it to the parent who already owns the other three Wubbzy DVDs. To be honest, it is the one we play the least for my son. As much as he loves Wubbzy, it feels like a letdown that they would release some of the same episodes that are already out.
As a parent, I would like more Wubbzy releases so that I may see some that I haven't already viewed 40+ times instead of regurgitated episodes that make me feel they are double dipping.",1246752000,5,1440,4.20216606498195
