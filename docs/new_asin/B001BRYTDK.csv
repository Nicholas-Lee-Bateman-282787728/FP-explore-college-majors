8284308,5,B001BRYTDK,"Irina Palm is the funniest movie I have seen in  years.  This is the story of an innocent 50-year old woman who gets a job in a sex shop to make money to handle her grandson 's medical problems.  Marianne Friendly plays the role of Irina and does it so well, you just love her for it. Her stogey friends are shocked but interested in  what she does and her son derides her.  See this film for some good laughs.",1445040000,,410,4.075
8284309,4,B001BRYTDK,"For a movie about a middle-aged woman forced by circumstances to manually administer orgasms to strangers in a seedy sex club, Irina Palm is surprisingly sweet. The set up is simple: Maggie's grandson needs medical treatment that the parents can't afford. Desperate, Maggie takes a job at a sex club working the glory hole. As it turns out, she is a natural and is able to earn a great salary and eventually develops a name for herself -- and a faithful clientele -- as ""Irina Palm."" The movie could have gone a couple of directions, playing for laughs and titillation or taking a more serious, thoughtful approach. The filmmakers chose the serious path and it was well worth it. Marianne Faithful is tremendous, bringing vulnerability, strength and an appropriate resignation that comes with age, to the character. Her Maggie sees a way out of the predicament, and makes the best of it. The entire cast is excellent though, gritty and real, but Miki Manojlovic as the club owner is a standout. It covers a lot of territory including the inequity of health care, the debilitating nature of the sex trade, the objectification of women, familial bonds, small town pressures (in England, but I presume they are universal) and, of course, the mechanics of the perfect hand job. Check this movie out, it's a treat.",1356307200,2,1309,4.848214285714286
