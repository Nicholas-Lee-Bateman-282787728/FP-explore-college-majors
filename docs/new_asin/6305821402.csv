1083201,5,6305821402,An amazing anime with goood plots and story lines. It's my favorite cartoon (next to sailor moon) because it's more realistic and mature than some of the other animes. I've seen nine of the episodes so far and my favorite is number 3 (5 gundams confirmed) because it has the original  jappenese opening song called communication. A must for any anime fan.,953251200,,355,4.725806451612903
1083202,5,6305821402,"An excelent anime.  A must see if you enjoyed Robotech or love mecha.  I gave 4 and 1/2 because it can be irritating to see Heero be so anti-social at all times.  At the begining is fine, but by episode 8 I would expect  some better character development.  Aside from a lack of preliminary  character development the voice acting is excellent, the mecha designs are  the best I have seen, and the animation is extremly smooth.",953164800,3,426,4.526315789473684
1083203,5,6305821402,"Gundam wing is one of the greatest anime's ever.  It is definitely a must buy.  It starts out with 5 Mobile Suits, made out of Gundanium alloy, hence the name Gundam.  These 5 suits have pilots, their names are Heero, Duo,  Katra, Troa, and Wufei.  This video is somewhat violent, so I suggest this  to older viewers (12 and over).  This is a great break from some other  animes.  For example i watch Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Tekkamen Blade,  Fushigi Yugi, etc...  This is most different in a good way, so please, if  you are an anime fan, purchase this video.  By the way, wanna chat or talk  about anime?

1083205,3,6305821402,"Not the best of the Gundam series, that honor would go to Zeta Gundam or Stardust Memories. However it's a decent intro to the Gundam series if you like pretty looking teenage boys (I however do not...). This series easily  could have lost 10 or so episodes and been a lot better. The mecha designs  are decent the Tallgeese and the Wing Zero are two of the best designs of  the series. You all should know this series runs about 49 episodes and  really doesnt end with 49. There is another 3-part OVA called Endless waltz  that finishes (somewhat anti-climactically) the series.

1083297,5,6305821402,"I love Gundam Wing and I won't lie that I think this is the best Gundam Wing anime out there because of the fact that the characters are just so human that it's hillarious. I love Duo Maxwell because he lightens the mood and has so many funny antics that you can't even believe would be possible. Dorothy Catalonia is just plain scary with her forked eyebrows but my friend and I had a wonderful time with comments thrown at Dorothy.

1083299,2,6305821402,"Ah, Gundam Wing.  Like many other Americans, this was the series that got me ""into"" anime (unless you count the time I spent watching DBZ, but I'm trying to forget that particular bit of fandom).  One of the spinoffs from the original UC (Universal Century) Gundam storyline, Gundam Wing takes place in the AC (After Colony) timeline, giving it no connection to its predecessors... or so Bandai would have you think.  Although GW was my first anime series and will always hold a certain place in my heart (somewhere far, far above DBZ), after a few more years I decided it was time to look back on it with a more critical eye.  My perceptions had changed with experience.

It's not that Gundam Wing is a BAD series... it's just not very good.  I don't need to bore you with too many story details, since the plot is summarized perfectly well in the Amazon review above.  It echoes the conflict of the UC timeline (spacenoids versus Earthlings, although neither term is present here.)  The problem is entirely in the execution; Gundam Wing is very slow and repetitive.

Let's take it from the top.  The series spans 49 episodes. Fifteen to twenty of these could be cut without impairing the story one bit.  These extra episodes are generally interludes in which one of the Gundam pilots meets the people - usually townspeople or guerilla fighters in some wartorn part of the world.  After a couple of these, however, you realize that they're all pretty much the same: a Gundam pilot lands, talks to some people, hears a little speech about how great Total Pacifism (tm) is, and then is forced to fight to save his new friends from a sudden onslaught of bad guys.  Conversations between the rivals Heero and Zechs follow a similar pattern, with lots of harping about the nature of rivalry and conflict (I lost count of the times somebody said ""Why are we fighting this meaningless battle?"" during the series.)  Ultimately these speeches are nothing but filler - they sound nice until you realize that there's very little substance to them; they're there solely to make the series sound more intellectual than it actually is.

The politics of the story are similarly repetitive; the Earth and colonies are seized by a series of evil organizations, with another always appearing to replace its destroyed predecessor.  You learn nothing about any of these groups, and don't really care when a hated enemy suddenly becomes the Gundams' ally.

Fans of UC Gundam will notice many suspiciously familiar events and characters.  Zechs and Relena, children of a murdered visionary who end up on opposite sides of the conflict, replace Char Aznable and Sayla Mass from Gundam 0079.  Heero, Zechs' rival, is intended to echo Amuro Ray - although while Amuro was human (sometimes annoyingly so), Heero is a flat and lifeless character.  The Zero System replaces the superhuman Newtypes.  Colonel Bask's colony laser from Zeta Gundam appears in two different incarnations here.  The original concept for Operation Meteor (described in Endless Waltz) is a blatant recycling of Operation Stardust and the Zeon colony drop, while the final battle on the Libra battle station is a ripoff of the finale to Char's Counterattack.  Even Endless Waltz continues the tradition, with Treize's daughter Mariemeia and her captor Dekim Barton replacing Mineva Zabi and Hamarn Karn of Zeta Gundam and ZZ.

The series' ""action"" is very weak, consisting of invincible Gundams mowing down hordes of hapless enemies - combat seems entirely too easy, and there's very little sense of danger at any time.  About halfway through there's a brief stretch where the Gundams inexplicably start losing, but it's only a couple of episodes before they're back on top again.  To top it off, the animation is pretty choppy, and there are many scenes where the same clip of animation is pasted onto different backgrounds to represent different locales.

I could go on, but you're probably getting the picture.  Although GW is still a decent show, it lacks the intensity and depth that makes other anime series (the UC Gundams among them) great.  It's fun mindless entertainment, but once you move on to something smarter (Cowboy Bebop was my next series), you probably won't look back.  Not bad as an introduction to anime, and a good serious show for younger viewers... but those who demand MORE will look elsewhere.",1102204800,5,4369,4.912806539509536
1083300,4,6305821402,"For all you GW haters out there, you need to cool off!  I've seen the original series, 008, 0083, 8th MS team, and Seed.  I enjoy Gundam Seed the most.  GW is a close second.  You can complain that the story was too complicated, or too unrealistic, but look...Gundam design has changed since 0083.  Gundams are more bad ass than ever.  You want to bitch about the past, fine, you do that.  Your kinda like someone that thinks DOS is great, and won't switch to Windows cause you say ""look at all the cool thing I can do with DOS.""  The original series sucked!  The White Base looked like a retarted floating box.  I'll stick with the newer age Gundam thank you!  I recomend 0083, 8th MS, GW, and Seed.
GW has it all.  Cool charaters.  The best mecha design out of all the series besdies Seed!  GW was a bold experiment for the Gundam series and it succeded much to the Relic's (old Gundam fans) dismay!",1088208000,,901,4.317365269461078
1083301,1,6305821402,"I am aghast at all of the good reviews this series has received, therefore I felt the need to post my own opinion.  And worry not, Wingers, it shall be short.
Basically all that I am going to say is that I ordered volume 8 of Mobile Suit Gundam from Amazon.com for $12 and they sent me the entire Gundam Wing DVD boxset instead.  And you know what I did?  I sent the boxset back because I wanted that darn MSG tape.
Don't think for a second that this is what Gundam is all about.  Gundam is not babbling, superficial politics, overpowered Gundams, mindless killing that shows no human side of the soldiers, nonsensical ""philosophy,"" and bishounen with ambiguous sexual orientation.  Real Gundam shows what war is all about, it shows you the politics rather than have one character ramble on about them for one hour.  It has real characters to whom you can relate and more emotion in one episode than in all 49 episodes of Wing.
Can you tell me the name of any of the OZ grunts that died at the hands of your beloved heroes, except for maybe Hilde's friend?  I thought not.  Go watch 0080 or Mobile Suit Gundam.  Heck, even 08th MS Team is better than this tripe.
(By the way, God of Death was originally used in G Gundam in reference to the character Kieral.  It's also used in 08th MS Team.  So it is not hypocritical for a Wing-hater to use it.)",1073260800,,1347,4.348
1083302,3,6305821402,"I apologize if this turns into a review of the series, but this is more a response to it currently being in the ""Essential DVD"" Anime section. Some good points of this series are its animation and general production quality, which both seem above par for a TV show. However, I never found that I could identify, or sympathize with any of the characters. I don't even like most of them. There seems to be no middle ground, either their too cruel or too nice, too aloof, or too outgoing. The plot is the same, convoluted to a point that if you miss an episode or two, whole groups of characters have changed sides and you will essentially have no idea what is going on. In all honesty, if you have the resources, see Gundam X which was released after GW in Japan(not yet released in US). Having seen the first twelve episodes, it has a plot that understands its limitations, and allows you to focus more on a few pilots and the main characters. Versus 5 pilots and who knows how many others in GW. Lots of characters and a complex plot are not bad, but I think GW is too confused in later episodes, trying too hard to impress the viewer, both with its outlandish plot and numerous upgrades to the mobile suits. Check out professional reviews of this show before you start buying this series. Basically, if the other 44 episodes aren't good enough, the first five shouldn't be ""essential.""",1053043200,,1386,4.482213438735178
1083303,5,6305821402,"The first volume of Gundam Wing starts by giving us a summary of the political situation between the Earth government and the Colonies of outer space. From there we are treated to the entry of the Gundam Pilots, who begin their all-out war against the Oz military oganization (which is hiding itself inside of the Earthsphere Alliance government). But since the Gundam pilots don't know each other, and a series of developments have arguably the best pilot (Heero Yuy) meet the daughter of the Vice Foreign Minister, and lose his Gundam to the enemy, let's just say that the first episode starts with a bang.
From there the series continues to give us more info about the personality and fighting style of each of the pilots. We also continue to get to know ace Oz pilot Zechs Marquise (and some of the people he considers friends and enemies). The last episode of the DVD treats us to a major revelatoin about the past of Relena Peacecraft (the Foreign Minister's daughter), and shows beyond any doubt (just in case we had any), that Oz is in fact evil.
From this first DVD you might get the impression that this show is going to fall into the old trap of having our heroes fight, get beat up, grow in resolve, and win. But giving up on this series after the first few epiodes would be a very big mistake indeed. In the next volume comes the first major plot twist. And let's just say that it can be mighty hard to figure out who your enemy is when the world situation keeps changing. This DVD is worth seeing for the end of the first episode alone (a true classic), but rest assured that this show gets much better later on. If you're a Gundam fan, definitely check this one out.

Then one fateful day I stop of the last ten minutes of the 15th episode and that was enough to make love this series. Gundam Wing in my opinion is the best Gundam series and is my favorite anime. The characters and plot line are all solid and superb. The action scenes are great and so are the mechas. Anyone who watches this series will love it.

It has a good mixture of action (mechas fighting mechas) and drama between the characters (surprisingly, even the 'bad guys' are well developed and offer more than an evil chuckle here and there).

Practically invincible, he can survive falls out of the fifteenth story of a building, torpedo explosions, his Gunam's self-destruct, and more. Heero has issues though, like trying to shoot Relena. Duo is the troubled soul who has to put up with Heero's friendship (more like vandalism). Quatre and Trowa are best friends, and their both into musical instruments. Trowa also performs in the circus. Wufei is my least favorite, because he is always dissing girls, saying that they are the weakest opponents that ever crossed his path. Boy would I like to beat him up!!
Relena Peacecraft is the princess of the Sanc Kingdom, but she's anything but a spoiled brat. She is also an excellant aim with guns. ..",1018569600,,851,4.916666666666667

1083353,5,6305821402,"I knew that a friend of mine really loves this show, so I picked up a copy of volume 1 when I had some extra cash, expecting some decent entertainment, but nothing too special. I was totally blown away by this show. From minute one, as the narrator comes on and introduces the backstory, I was totally absorbed by it. I've never been a ""Gundamaniac"" or a fan or the giant robot genre of anime in general, so I was surprised by how much I enjoyed watching the first five episodes.

The characters at first seem somewhat two-dimensional, but as the show progresses, they each reveal hidden depths. Heero, despite his cold, no-nonsense attitude, is instantly likeable as the show's hero, and Zechs, the masked mystery-man, has got to be one of the most compelling not-quite villains I've ever seen.
Don't let the all-too brief description on the box or any trailers you may have seen fool you; this isn't just another mindless shoot-em-up. Gundam Wing mixes compelling characters, a detailed backstory, political intrigue, a hint of romance, and really cool action sequences. Every time you think you've got this show figured out, another plot twist gets thrown in your face. All that isn't apparent immediately, of course; Gundam Wing is one of those shows you have to watch for a while to really get into. The plot of each episode runs into the next, so you really should start with volume one, or you won't have a clue what's going on.
I've only seen about half the show, so I don't know how it all ends, but I'm working on collecting it along with all the other Gundam series that have been released in the States. All in all, I would defenately recomend this to just about anyone.",1001116800,3,1682,4.625418060200669
1083403,5,6305821402,"If you are a newbie to anime, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing will probably be hard for you to grasp (though still the best to start with out of all the Gundam series). GW starts out monotoned, slow, with some explosions here and there but nothing that intrigueing. The characters appear to be single based, Heero the stoic perfection, Duo the jester, Trowa the silent one, Quatre the nice one, Wufei the arrogant dignified one, and of course, Relena, err...I'm not going there. :D The diversity of the characters seem to be an overused formula in fictional works. At first I was turned off by that. It felt too catagorized. But then a friend of my made me watch half of the series in one night. I thought I was going to die, but the exact opposite happened! I was addicted. ~_~ Yes, the characters are somewhat formula based, but they have been formula-ed well. All the boys carry with them a certain mysterious air of their past and skills. Plus, they are really darn likable. You'll have a favorite soon enough (Duo and Wu-chan! yah! :) The plotline is very good too. It's kind of difficult to follow. With OZ and romafellar and the relena girl and the pilots. You can't exactly nail one side as the bad side. It's much like war. Gundam Wing offers a bleak outlook on human kind. Of how we will fight as long as we live. It's really gloomy, yet it provokes a lot of thinking. My only problem with GW is Relena Peacecraft, no, I'm not going to say she's an annoying Heero stalker. I'm going to say this. While she symbolizes a certain 'hope' with in the war. She's such a vague yet bland character. She rose out of no where and got accepted in the political world. This whole pacisfist thing thus became very idealistic while the rest of the anime seem very realistic. *_* So after much rambling. I definitely recommand this to people all ages above 13. Guys will enjoy it for the meccas (excellantly drawn btw). Girls will pretend they love the plot more when they are really going for the boys (hey, it's true, that's partly the functions of the pilots. Eye candy). ^_^",998352000,,2065,4.480106100795756
1083404,3,6305821402,"I haven't seen very many Gundam series, besides the ones that have aired on U.S television, completely dubbed and editted.  But to tell you the truth, from what I've seen - Gundam isn't what people make it out to be.  The animation quality is standard, considering the low-budget.  It's rather bland, but never unbearable.
War is depicted in this movie as romantic and slightly idealistic.  There the stoic main characters, completely devoid of any reall feelings (the MAJORITY).  The first episodes got you started, got you thinking, but left you hanging in confusion.
Simply put, Gundam Wing was poorly constructed (quite sloppy).  Obviously they were going for something deep, and would have achieved that.  But complicated political matters were just too massive to be explained in a few short episodes.
My last comment is the voice dubs.  Yeah, they weren't as bad as I've seen.  Personally, never heard the Japeneese voices for any of these characters.  But the English voices were pretty bad, and carried very little emotion (with the exception of Trieze, maybe, and Duo Maxwell).  The feelings just never got across.

Gundam Wing is more the flair of Power Rangers -- invincible, color-schemed, good looking young men who are basically one dimensional characters.  Gundam Wing may have been good nuff as a standalone series, but it really shoudlnt be included as a Gundam series.  That is just wrong.  It does injustice to the rest of the Gundam saga.

Certain characters become very interesting quickly and that is often difficult in a giant-robot anime. The robots are quite well designed, each a slight variation on the others, and the combat between them is excellent.
Gundam's music is also excellent, particularly the opening theme which I find myself hummming quite often.

1083410,5,6305821402,"I first started watching the Gundam Wing series on CN because it was on right before Tenchi. I only caught the end of some episodes, so I was lost most of the time. But then I watched Ep. 49 in its entirety, and I fell in love with Gundam Wing. Needless to say, when CN took it off Toonami, I was VERY upset. But now I can buy the DVDs...and there's a rumor that GW is coming back on in a week... I have a DVD player only on my computer, but even then the quality is just superb. The color is so much better (I never knew how bright Sandrock was in EW until I watched it on DVD), and so is the sound. BTW, does anyone else think that CN made a grave mistake in taking the original opening, which is set to Just Communication, and cutting out most of the good clips and changing the music to make an ending? Oh, and if you have heard the song It's Just Love (or Just Love), then you'll never think of it the same way after seeing the original ending. It's VERY funny, and if you hate Relena, then this might be torture (or you might find it hilarious). I like how if you activate the subtitles, the translations (or the original Japanese lyrics for Ep. 2 & 4) for Just Communication and Just Love appear on the screen.  On the subject of subtitles...I am completely spoiled now because I've heard the original voices. They all just...fit. Duo's is so funny in episode 4, when he's talking about Heero being antisocial and all that. I absolutely love hearing Zechs speak. Noin's original voice makes her seem much younger. All I can say about Quatre's is that if you think he sounds like a girl...then you're right. Quatre was done by a woman.  The subtitles are either identical to or very close to the dubbing...except in one spot on this DVD that I can remember. It's in episode 4, when Noin is looking at the collage of Zechs pictures on the table. The original line is something like, ""Come here and lean on me."" I can understand why they changed it, but it does ruin the effect. Episode 4 is just full of sweet scenes between Noin and Zechs. It's probably one of my favorite episodes. Having seen the whole series with the exception of about three episodes, I must say that this is my absolute favorite anime. There is so much character development, and the plot twists and turns, often unexpectedly. Having watched the last episode that pitted the leader of the White Fang against Gundam pilot 01 (Heero Yuy) in a final, very thrilling battle, I must admit I was absolutely shocked when I watched the first few episodes and realized exactly who the White Fang commander was. It's very emotional at times (I've cried on occasion), and not for the faint of heart. There is mild swearing, and quite a bit of blood. Which, may I add, does look rather realistic.  Overall, this is an excellent DVD, and anyone who has seen the dubbed series on TV, or wants a solid introduction to the world of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, should buy this. I found it WELL worth the cost.",983664000,,2967,4.361663652802894
1083411,5,6305821402,"Excited to buy the first Gundam Wing video, I went right home and popped it in my VCR. It starts out with previews for Gundam 0080, Gundam 0083 and the Toonami commercial for Gundam Wing. After watching the sweet opening, which is basically the ending theme from the version on Cartoon Network, I was allready excited. The first episode has the five pilots make it to Earth. The other characters (Zechs, Teize, Mr. Dorlin) are also introduced, but the two main people get introduced is Heero and Relena who have an unfriendly run in and an even more ugly conversation later. The second episode pays tribute to Duo Maxwell, pilot of the Gundam Deathsythe, who stops the search for Wing Zero in the sea and has a run in with Heero which ends up with Heero firing torpedoes at both Gundams, sinking them into the sea. The third episode has Quatre, pilot of Sandrock, and Trowa, pilot of Heavyarms, take on an OZ base while Duo helps Heero escape from OZ's security and helps retrieve the Gundam's that sunk. We also get a peek at a new mobile suit called Talgese which will be discussed more later on. And a speical group is introduced called the 'Specials' which is a very mysterious group of soldiers. The fourth episode finally gives rise to the last pilot, Wu Fei, pilot of the Shenlong or as he calls it, ""Nataku"". Zechs heads towards the military base where Noin is a teacher. Noin has a love for Zechs and her students, but in the night, they are killed off by Wu Fei. As Noin tracks down Wu Fei, Heero makes repairs to his Gundam. We also get to see our first glimpse of Lady Une, a woman who will become very important later on. After more complication, Wu Fei ends up destroying a carrier full of suits, leaving Noin injured and full of rage. These first 4 episodes aren't as great as the later ones as they are mostly paying fan service to those who love the Gundam pilots. But I can't help, but keep coming back to Gundam Wing every once in awile. The dubbing is a little stale at this point. In fact, if you compare Sally's dubbed vocie to that of later ones, you'll see she has a more stronger voice. Zechs' dub is pretty much on par with the latter episodes, but Treize's voice seems to be the only one that stays the same through out the series. Granted, the animation is no Evangelion, but its fun to watch. You try telling me that mobile suit battles aren't fun to watch. It political war at its best.

1083435,4,6305821402,"Originally (back when Gundam Wing began airing on Cartoon Network last spring) I had no intentions of watching it. My friends talked me into it (I bribed them by agreeing to the deal that if I watched the first episode they would learn the Japanese names of all the characters of Bishoujou Senshi Sailor Moon). I thought I had gotten a pretty good deal, but I was quite wrong. The first episode intrigued me, so I continued to watch the series as it progressed, switching from dubbed edited to dubbed uncut at night by taping the episodes and watching them the next day. About halfway through the series I found out they were marketing a DVD of it, and I decided that if it was bilingual I would buy it. I prefer subtitled to dubbed any day and only liked the dubbing of Gundam Wing because they used WordFit, which gives the most accurate English translation that still fits the syllable limit. So I bought the DVD, and watched it. The quality of the DVD was good, since the picture was sharp, and I liked the quality of the original voice work. However, the one fact that continually bothered me was the fact that the subtitles were almost exactly the same as the dubbed. I understand that this is because of the WordFit but that's really no excuse. However, I gave it a higher rating because I like the subtitle option which is unavailable in VHS format at a lower cost (VHS requiring a separate purchase of both dubbed and subbed costing about $40-$60 whereas DVD is about $20-$30 for both). ^_^",980899200,,1499,4.514705882352941

The characters are Impressive yet have a truly good feel. It also has a AMAZING storyline. it starts off In a war with treiz as the leader of OZ a Evil organization opressing the people of the space colonies and in war. The gundams were sent down to Destroy and assassinate Treiz ...The gundam pilots are heero yuy Qruatra robaba winner. Duo maxwell. Wuefei Chang and trowa barton (excuse the name misspellings) with gundams...which are pretty much indescructable. with Zechs marquise...(my favorite character) a formor OZ leader...well a oz leader for a short period of time at the beginning.. which breaks off and starts his own War against oz a little later. Noin His trusty assistant and good friend...also plays a very big roll in this with relena doirlin as a peaceloving character who is in love with heero and a queen of the saink kingdom. which is at war with OZ at the same time There are many other characters and other side plots...Including Trowa living at a circus and whatnot it has a very intruging plot and WELL worth the money.

When I started to watch it, it was on the recomendation of a friend and I came in about 2 weeks before the series was over was forever lost.  Once it  started over again on Cartoon Network, things started to make sense and I  fell in love with the series and it's characters.  It is set in After  Colony 195 and it's a time when wars are breaking out in the colonies.  Five Gundams are sent to earth to fight the secret organization of OZ.

I think that there is a lot of stuff in  the subbed that was lost in the dubbing.  It's little things though like  Heero makes all these noises in the dubbed when he gets shot and falls out  of windows, but he doesn't in the subbed.

Gundam Wing premeired in  1995 in Japan and now (2000) is running with a English dub in the US on  Cartoon Network. It is the story of 5 teenage Gundam Pilots and their  adventures trying to save both the Earth and the space Colonies that sent  them to fight. Each caricter has a rather disturbing past and there seems  to be a lot of Yaoi hinting going on throughout the seriese between Duo  Maxwell and Heero Yuy and between Quatre Raberba Winner and Trowa Barton  (Triton Bloom). The seriese is 49 episodes long and contains a lot of  violence. (Charicteristic of Mecha Animes). Contrary to what the Amizon  review says the DVD is actually rated 13 and Up for language and violence  and Quatre is spelled with an E at the end of it, not an A. The DVD also  comes with a holographic image of Heero and Gundam Wing-01 and has the  first 5 episodes dubbed and subtitled. This seriese has become my favorite  over the last few months. It has truely great animation, the music is great  and the vocal artists from both counrties are phenominal! If you enjoy GW  then there is also a 3 part OVA seriese about these charicters that was  released in 1998 (in Japan) called ""Shin Kidousenki Gundam Wing:  Endless Waltz"" that Cartoon Network will be running soon in America.  Shortly after it premeirs on TV it will be available to buy. It is actaully  already available at Cartoon/Anime/Manga/Comic conventions in the US. It  has been sighted at ""Comic-com"" in both subbed and dubbed  formats.",959385600,11,1757,4.636363636363637

I fondly remember watching the original Mobil Suit Gundam series back in 1979 - 80 in Japan but ,after my father got transferred over to the states, I've  been stuck watching the occasional video sent from Japan and the  'net....until now :)
The story is typical Gundam fare, pretty deep, but a  bit confusing 'till a bit later on in the series.  Characters are good with  good development as the series moves on and the quality of the animation is  amazing to say the least.  I just hope they continue to bring more of the  series over to the US.  Maybe not air it but at least release them on DVD  (I watch it in Japanese so it's nice on DVD).

When I finally saw it that first day it was aired, I had to pick my  jaw up from the ground!  I was blown away by this anime show, it amazed me  that an anime that was made in the 70/80's could be this good.
Human  beings from earth want to live more peaceful lives.  They build five  colonies up in space and live peacfully under the ruler Heero Yuy.  When HY  was assasinated by some unknown organazation, communucation cease between  the colonies and this was the reason for strengthening the government power  on earth.  The united earth's speare alliance begins taking over the  colonies one by one and controlling them with force.  The colonies are  tired of being suppressed, so they send down five pilots of mobile suits  called Gundams to earth, disguising them as shooting stars.
I have seen  the whole Gundam Wing series, and have yet to see Endless Waltz-the sequel  to Gundam Wing.  In my opinion, it beats Dragon Ball Z by not only the  animation quality, good dubbing, originality and depth of the story, great  character development (some of the girls may be questionable) but the  emotional feeling you actually get from watching the show. Some of the  characters you can even see a significant change in them by the end of the  series. You will be hooked within a few episodes, or like me and a lot of  other people, the first day.  As for a final rap up, the music is great and  was done by TWO MIX, awesome mecha's, and good voice artists including  Scott Mcneil (Piccolo from DBZ) and Ward Perry (Yamcha from DBZ).

I loved the animation, and the battles  were awesome. The character designs were some of the best I've ever seen,  though I tend to say things like that about all bishonen anime. The  characters presonalities were well done too, and I noticed there was always  more to them than met the eye. For instance, is Heero just a cold blooded  killer? Why does he act so antisocial? Why does Quatre hate fighting so  much? These aren't hard questions to answer, but they do make you think.  Thats always good.  The mecha were neat too. I liked the way the bad guys  acted whenever the word ""gundam"" was mentioned. Very tight.  Of  course, each gundam has its own special abilities, and to top that off,  they're made from gundanium alloy, and are almost indistructible. The bad  guys aren't weak, however. Even Duo notices the new strength of the badguys  armor. This series also has a good setting. Its about a war, and it looks  like one too. With a very dark mood, a tight political situation, and lots  of explosions, its bound to be good. There are some really awesome scenes  in Gundam Wing. I won't spoil them for you, but they're the ones that make  you think: THIS IS SOOOO COOL! Well, that review didn't make any sense, but  who cares. Now, I will close with a quote; ""Put your hands down. I was  the first one to come out and surrender, remember?"" -Quatre",958953600,,1536,4.472924187725631

It starts from the begining with good action so we aren't left  waiting for it to start. The pilots for these Gundams are so unusual and  startling that you feel as if the roles of good guys vs bad guys are  reversed sometimes. Other reviewers are right in that there is good balance  in both the dramatic aspect and the action sequences so it should appeal to  a wide variety of audiences. As for the dvd itself, great job. Not too many  bells and whistles, but it does have the standard dvd options such as  credits, bios, previews, language/subtitle, and chapter search. Picture  appearance is pretty clear. I'd say comparable to the Ranma OAV set, and a  little better than the Evangelion disc. If there's one fault to this disc,  I'd say again as with most of the discs I'v watched is the shimmering that  seems to occur on the yellow subtitles although this disc wasn't as bad as  the Ranma ones, IMHO. It's better, but you still notice some flickering to  the subtitles if you really get annoyed by such things. Anyways, despite  that, I'd highly recommend this disc to anyone who's a fan of Macross or  Space Cruiser Yamato cause it has the ""epic"" quality to it  that'll make you mad when you reach the end of the disc and have to wait  another month for the next.",958780800,2,1422,4.470817120622568

You  hear words first that the charecter speaks, then you see the subtitles.  That annoyed me. But hey, no one's perfect.

1083618,5,6305821402,"Coming off of DBZ in search for another anime adrenaline rush, I happened upon Gundum Wing. Immediately, I was intrigued by the beautiful animation, detail, and extremely deep characters.
 While many epic sagas pit an  overwhelming evil force against an underdog good force, Gundum actually  gives the most powerful weapons to the ""good guys"". Simple? If  only that were so.
 A trademark of this unique series is that the  destruction always comes from within. Not only do the colonies abandon the  Gundum Pilots, but the creation of Zero System threatens to destroy its  pilot's sanity.
 While winning wars comes to them easily, dealing with  their emotions does not, and gives rise to countless internal struggles  often ending with anger.
 Perhaps the most appealing aspect, however, is  the complexity of the story. While DBZ makes it childlishly clear whats  going on, Gundum Wing actually requires quite a bit of attention and  consideration. Many paths are taken, many doors unlocked, and numerous  mysterious unravel slowly and skillfully to allow for true universal chaos.
 You will not find mindless action here, nor will you find multi-alien  races warring as DBZ dwells on. What is guaranteed is simply the very  definition of epic and a most bewildering character study told in a complex  environment that is as realistic as anything in this world.
 Perhaps  thats Gundum's edge on other anime. Its believable (assuming we had the  same technology). I can easily picture a future of this nature.",956707200,6,1508,5.11522633744856

1083620,5,6305821402,"Gundam wing epitomizes one of the greatest and largest stretching anime's in Japan, Starting in 1979 with mobile Suit Gundam wing 0079 the series has progressed throughout these past 20 years, up to it's latest incarnation  Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team: Miller's Report Movie;  which  premiered August 1998 in Japan.
Encompassing a string of more than 400  episodes Gundam wing is probably by far the longest stretching anime Japan,  or the US has ever seen.  Although we are only getting 49 of those  episodes, the episodes we are getting are absolutely amazing, especially  since they have never deviated from the original Gundam released back in  1979.
Perhaps the best feature of this series is that they have  maintained the original anime style that was apparent from the late 70's to  the early 80's.  It's sad that a lot of today's animes don't maintain that  high standard.  The standard with which we are all familiar with, anime  titles such as Voltron, Thundercats, Transformers, series which we knew and  love.  The same quality and epic proportion of those series is continued on  making Gundam and amazing world, as well as an amazing show.
On the  visual level, Gundam wing is pure eye candy, from the giant Gundams, to the  battles, to the interaction of the characters.  All have been drawn  beautifully, and this series is worth buying just to watch it as it unveils  it's splendor.
But Gundam wing can't just be enjoyed on the visual  element, it must be enjoyed with all facets it has to employ, story line,  visual, emotional, it's attention to detail, everything.

Although Gundam series are oriented toward male mecha fans, along with the afternoon and midnight runs of Toonami, the latter airing uncut versions of the series. As I am female, you can bet my infatuation with an anime character and the voice involved was just part of my future in the arts.

Onto business.

The series is within an alternate universe in the Gundam metaseries. This was done for a few series, starting with Mobile Fighter G Gundam (which received a dubbed version, albeit a buttload of political correction was involved to not alienate and offend Americans. The Japanese stereotypes of the nationalities presented were obviously outdated.)

The story begins in the year After Colony (AC) 195. A hostile military coup by the United Earth Sphere Alliance under the guise of Justice and Peace has the colonists in space under oppression. Five rebel citizens team up after being sent to Earth to fight for their home in space.

The Characters introduced includes Heero Yuy (his nationality is confusing, but I will explain later), Duo Maxwell (American, but his voice actor is Australian-Canadian and rather well known outside of anime. If you saw his picture of him with long hair, he'd be a dead ringer for Duo as an adult.), Trowa Barton (a man of mystery in that he doesn't speak much of his past or identity. As far as narrowing down his ethnicity, he is somewhere between Russian and French), Quatre Raberba Winner (although he is listed as Arabic, his ethnicity is likely Berber, which are rather pale in all over complexion. He is usually portrayed as being so spoiled that he sustains injuries often due to all over weakness.) And Wufei Chang (Stereotypical Chinese warrior with cold tactical operations)

(The comments above were gleaned from various perspectives on the identities of the five pilots.)

So, the first episode, expect plenty of action in mech to mech combat with a side of deep teenage drama and angst.

Second episode, Duo is introduced along with the Gundam Deathscythe.

Third episode, Duo busts Heero out of a UESA hospital and Trowa goes mech to mech with Quatre.

Fourth episode: If you like Michael Bay, you may appreciate the explosion and following mech fight

Fifth episode, The girl who attempted to reach out to Heero, Relena has one rather heavy Bombshell of info dropped and with her mind blown, Relena is at a crossroads on her future.
