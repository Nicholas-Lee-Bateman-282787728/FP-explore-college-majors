7992505,4,B00009PY3M,"Great play, a must if you're a Lanford Wilson fan and know such classics
of his as Fifth of July, Burn This, Talley's Folley, and The Rimers of Eldritch.
Recently watched the latter in this same series, both are early to mid 70s
productions and both DVDs reflect that, they may not be remastered or
crystal-clear but they're both watchable films of these plays and both
contain enough dramatic tension to keep you watching.

The Mound Builders was produced around late 1975-1976 for this PBS film of the play,
with Brad Dourif more or less fresh coming off his impressive film debut
in Cuckoo's Nest, and his exceptional performance in this play just saw
him going from strength to strength.  Disturbing, perhaps sometimes
seeming a tad disjointed at times so many years later, but still gripping.
Got me going online to research the mound building cultures and ancient
civilizations that we didn't learn about in school, of course.  It's not a feather
in the cap of the USA that the education system is so ignorant and
pathetic.  We barely were taught who the Mayans or Incans were
if I recall correctly, even through college, so that tells you what a racist
ridiculous narrow-minded heap of garbage the USA and its pathetic
education system is.  That I had to turn to Lanford Wilson and one
of his older plays to even start getting an education on this subject
in a roundabout way is scarifying, and I always considered myself
an ardent history and archaeology and also dinosaur etc. fan as a kid in
particular.

I was taught everything about the Roman Empire and
ancient Greek civ. and everything that came afterwards but
we're taught nothing about these ancient North American tribes
and civilizations that were here thousands of years before
the first Europeans showed up on our shores.

In any case, Wilson's The Mound Builders is mainly about legacies left behind
and/or the destruction or neglect of same, and of course the
usual theme of progress and blind modern greed versus conservation
and respect for our own history, as well as getting down, especially
by the play's denouement, to an even more visceral civilization
versus savagery equation and the ""are we really that evolved
or civilized?"" and it would seem that Wilson's summation is primarily
of the most cynical variety. I wouldn't say that
Dourif's character and his landowner father register racism as
another trope, given that they don't care about the newly-uncovered Mounds
or their being turned into some local tourist attraction as long
as they can make their profit/real estate and resort ""killing""
from it somehow, which of course turns out to be an absurd
pipe dream, anyway.  The highway is coming through and
it will likely spare no-one.

The modern wrecking ball doesn't care whose side you are on, or what color your skin is or was.
I think that's another subtext here. There's also the question
of who owns all this, ultimately, and also as reflected
in Dourif's coveting of the main archaeologist's MD pregnant
wife who doesn't want anything to do with him, for obvious
reasons, even though he figures it's also because they all look down on him
because he's a local ""hick"" or somesuch delusion in his own
angry and jealous mind.  In his mind she's too good for this
effete intellectual and scientist, etc. One of Dourif's final
rants against the whole university team and the guy's wife
is almost worthy of his co-star Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest,
lacerating the townspeople's alleged ridicule of the ""ugly virgin""
Grad. student females hired to help at the dig (and their disregard
and contempt for same and, by association, the entire expedition), and railing
against the apparently ""worthless junk"" being dug
up such as the copper ""God-King's Death Mask"" that Dourif's angry, vengeful
local with utter delusions of grandeur (but as he semi-innocently states early in the
proceedings, he ""knows how to ride a tractor"") later adopts for his own dark purposes.

Apparently Robert Silverberg (whether THAT Bob
Silverberg of Sci Fi fame I dunno but I guess so) wrote a major book
on the Mound Builders in 1970 or so and that was before much of
the actual significant archaeology and conservation of some of the major
sites across the country was even accomplished.

I highly recommend this play and DVD of a Wilson masterpiece because
you're unlikely to be seeing this anywhere soon online or off, most likely,
in 2015, it's one of his seminal works, although lesser-known than it should be,
the cast and production are top-notch, and if you're like me someone who
was too young to get into Wilson from the get-go (I didn't even get to see
Burn This in 1987 on Broadway because I had no clue and was in college
and too busy and poor to attend even had I known what I was missing)
and are just catching up now this is a good place to start, although
perhaps Fifth of July or Rimers might be more obvious examples of
Wilson's more ""populist"" plays although I would say that none of them
are ""easily absorbed"" entertainments by any means.  His work is
difficult, painful, disturbing, sometimes a tad obtuse, but never boring
and never takes the easy way out.  I just wish this DVD and the Rimers
one were remastered/restored since both are showing their age a bit,
not HD by any means, but still, watchable.",1427760000,,5289,4.804180418041804
7992506,5,B00009PY3M,"Wilson was one of the most important playwrights of the 1960's-70's, and for my money one of his (many) masterpieces was ""The Mound Builders"".  If you love the theatre, this is a ""must have"" DVD!",1397865600,,195,4.571428571428571
7992507,5,B00009PY3M,"It's a great play with awesome actors :D  Brad Dourif is amazing, and the ending is really kind of disturbing, but really good anyway.",1386028800,,134,4.583333333333333
7992508,4,B00009PY3M,"Filmed for public television on location near the (real) Coster dig in southern Illinois, this 1976 production of Lanford Wilson's Obie Award-winning play details the excavation of Jasker Field by archaeologists as they try to solve some of the mysteries of Native American temple mounds from 700 - 1000 A. D.  This is frantic work, since a nearby lake is rising and a planned interstate, under construction, is scheduled to bury the site.  Wilson creates a cauldron of emotions by housing all the principals in a farmhouse belonging to Mr. Jasker, whose son Chad enthusiastically awaits the expansion of the lake, which will give him valuable ""waterfront property,"" and the building of the interstate, which will bring some excitement and change into his life.

As traces of civilization are uncovered at the dig, followed soon after by the discovery of artifacts and bones, the tension inside the house grows.  Each of the main characters has problems--a previous emotional breakdown, a pregnancy, the unwanted attentions of Chad Jasker, a divorce and loss of personal direction, alcoholism, irresponsibility, and professional stress--and the viewer cannot help but make comparisons between the seemingly structured lives of the mound builders and the chaos in the lives of their ""civilized"" investigators.  The ""resolution"" to the drama proves to be far more ""uncivilized"" than anything the early civilization might have contemplated.

Directed by Marshall Mason and Ken Campbell, the cast consists of relatively unknown actors.  Trish Hawkins, as the gynecologist-wife of one of the lead archaeologists, acts nave and without direction, and it is impossible to imagine her as a competent physician.  Brad Jourif, as Chad Jasker, is suitably menacing but lacks the vulnerability and intellectual curiosity that the author has given him.  Project director August Howe, played by Rob Thirkield, lacks the affect one would expect as he shows slides of the dig, which took place the previous year.  Despite the angst and the confessions, these characters behave stereotypically, and the acting lacks the subtlety that would have made the themes and the resolution truly moving.  Only Tanya Berezin, as alcoholic writer D. K. Erikson, the sister of August Howe, plays her role with a sense of cynical realism, becoming the linchpin of much of the action.

The videography is outstanding with many dramatically filmed scenes (Red Berridge), often framed by architecture, with interesting lighting and composition.  The play itself deals with important ideas, preservation vs. progress, which are still at issue thirty years later.  Though the acting may not be world class, this on-site production has a sense of immediacy often lacking in theatrical productions.  Mary Whipple",1119225600,12,2774,5.388888888888889
7992509,5,B00009PY3M,"The eastern half of the United States is dotted with thousands of ancient earthworks, most of them flat-topped pyramids, but some zoomorphic in design.  These earth mounds were built by the Adena, Hopewell, and  Mississippian Cultures that had all nearly vanished by the 1500's.  This  History Channel production gives the viewer a basic understanding of these  mounds and the people who built them, as well as why they were built.  It  was interesting to hear the ""theories"" of early Anglo scientists  as to the origins of these mounds!  Because of racism, it was believed that  anyone BUT Native Americans had built the mounds, from the lost tribes of  Israel to Egyptians and Mayans to lost Welshmen (? )!  This documentary  moves at a pretty good pace and isn't dull, and covers a few of the major  mound sites in the country, such as the Cahokia site in Illinois and  several sites in Alabama and Georgia.  If there are mounds in your area,  watch this video and then go see the actual earthworks yourself.  I  guarantee you will be impressed!",952473600,7,1048,4.754189944134078
