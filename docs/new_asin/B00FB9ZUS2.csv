Some Girls is a girl centric show focusing on four best friends with different walks of life. Unlike American shows that speak to a generation of wealthy white people, this speaks to a REAL generation of young people.

Instead of hiding behind white privilege, Some Girls embraces diversity, in a way no American show ever could.

Not only is this the most interesting show about teenage girls most people haven't seen in ages, it allows a quartet of young women to be as funny, if not, MORE comedic than their male counterparts.

They have attitudes, dirty mouths, have sex, drink, and don't allow to be kicked out of the boys club. If anything, they've made their own club. The ""Some Girls"" club. And Im glad Im apart of it.

One thing that really surprises me, is that it's centered on Viva. As a dark skinned Black girl, there is not enough of this on television. The show is told through her narration, and she's the perfect leading lady. Fans of Awkward Black Girl can rejoice. Somewhere, someone has answered our prayers.

It's not only just diverse based on race, but on lifestyles, religion, size, and class. Not all white people are rich. Sometimes they're middle or even lower class*gasp*.

I beg anyone without a region free dvd player, get one, or find this show online, or ITUNES. It deserves to be watched. There is finally a show that doesn't ignore that the world is a diverse one.",1387065600,8,1436,4.607843137254902
