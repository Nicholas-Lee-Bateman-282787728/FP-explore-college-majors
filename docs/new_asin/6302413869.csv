459678,3,6302413869,"""Murderer's Row"" and ""The Ambushers,"" Dean Martin's second and third go-rounds as secret agent Matt Helm, aren't meant to be taken seriously, and are very enjoyable if, like ol' Dino himself, you're in on the joke.  There are beautiful babes galore and amusing moments throughout both films (including good-natured digs at Dino's buddy, Frank Sinatra), not to mention some truly talented and even distinguished performers (most notably Janice Rule in ""The Ambushers"").  The Matt Helm series was never a threat to James Bond, or even The Man from U.N.C.L.E., but they were never meant to be either.  If you enjoy Dean Martin (as I do) or Austin Powers (as I do not), a good time can be had with this double feature.",926812800,2,714,4.836065573770492

7825362,2,6302413869,"""The Ambushers"" (1967) is the third film in Dean Martin's four-film ""Matt Helm"" franchise.  It is significantly weaker than the other three and the only one which does not feature a song by the Steubenville Thrush, I don't think that omission impacted the film's relative quality.  Martin was not in Sinatra's class as a singer or an actor but he was effortlessly likable and had some comedic talent.  ""The Ambushers"" gets two stars instead of one because Janice Rule gives a solid performance in the face of what must have been a professionally embarrassing production for her.  She looks extremely uncomfortable when she is not looking bored - I imagine her mind alternated between these two states.  I can't imagine that the typical Irwin Allen production design motivated any of the cast.

That said the film works quite well as a window into the pre-Woodstock era cultural vacuum.  It throws a bevy of pretty young starlets onto the screen,  none having the slightest dimensionality or being involved in anything remotely erotic.  Sizzle-wise it's all form over substance.

Rule (whose character physically looks a lot like Mrs. Peel) does provide a bit of erotic voltage in much the same classy detached way Diana Rigg did in a standard episode of ""The Avengers"".  Working against all the females in the cast are some of the worst costume choices you can imagine.  Apparently for a few days in 1967 dull finish boots that look to be made from shag carpet were trendy,  unfortunately those days appear to have been the days when the wardrobe choices were made.

The film had a villainess or at least the Francesca Madeiros character was intended to serve such a purpose.  Francesca is played by a foreign actress named Senta Berger.  She has orange skin, no waist, and wears large Christmas tree ornaments for earrings.  The film features a flying saucer and I wonder if the original script called for Francesca to be from Venus,  perhaps they forgot to communicate the changes to the wardrobe people.  That might explain the incredible leaps of logic and obvious gaps in the development of her character.  Berger's character is so garishly moronic that it elevates Rule's character or at least helps you appreciate the degree to which Rule was able to transcend this hopeless mess.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1437868800,,2335,4.873096446700508

7825364,4,6302413869,"Dean Martin is Matt Helm. He is an easy going secret agent, who appears to enjoy his booze.

A secret government flying saucer has been hijacked, so it's up to Matt to solve the case. As in all the Matt Helm films there is no shortage of hot women. These movies also have a very ""sixties"" style.

The Ambushers, as the other films, is played for laughs. The books that this film, and the others are loosely based on, are much more serious. Some fans of the books don't tend to like these movies, but if you enjoy a good spy spoof, you should give (The Ambushers) a try.",1272240000,,569,4.2110091743119265
7825365,5,6302413869,"Living in Australia, I bought this particular PAL system Dutch DVD of ""The Ambushers"" in the hope that it would be in English, not English with subtitles. North Americans and others beware: yes this disc is in the PAL system, not NTSC, and it is Zone 2 not Zone 1.
Those issues aside, upon arrival of the DVD which was prompt I was pleasantly surprised to discover I could indeed watch the film in English without subtitles. The story is quite flimsy and involves a lot of sexual innuendo. It's great! The DVD cover is mainly in English, however the film's plot description on the back is in Dutch. Colour and audio are of a very good quality. If you like the crassness of the 1960s, this DVD is a must for you. Some specifications below.
Film:
Columbia Pictures Corporation; 1967; Technicolor; starring Dean Martin as spy Matt Helm; music by Hugo Montenegro (the later ""I Dream of Jeannie"" TV theme).

7825366,1,6302413869,"Cashing in on Bondmania, ""The Silencers"" was a laid-back spy spoof with Dean Martin in high spirits as swinging agent Matt Helm. Unfortunately, the sequels were dreadful affairs. Dino barely shows up for ""The Ambushers"" (1967)  a low-budget mess involving Mexican beer vats and flying saucers! Martin throws in his usual dig at Frank Sinatra, but the drunk jokes fall flat. Bottom of the barrel, indeed.",1243555200,2,403,5.106060606060606

7825368,4,6302413869,"Mr. ""dboud"" has reviewed the wrong film.  His review would apply to the Matt Helm flick ""Murder's Row"" co-staring Ann Margaret.  In this, Dean's third Matt Helm, he finds fellow agent Janice Rule a mental patient in a straitjacket.  She's lost her memory -- and a top secret aircraft she was test piloting.  Matt helps jog her memory while looking for the craft.  Kurt Kasznar (Land of the Giants) appears as one of the villans.  A front for the bad guys is a brewery that makes XXX beer!  Maybe this is where Dos Eques got the idea from?  It also features an improbable telekinesis pistol whose only control is a simple trigger.  Delightfully non-serious superspy spoof.  Viva la Helm!",1104624000,,686,4.689075630252101
7825369,4,6302413869,"Ok,I realize that by any normal standard this would qualify as a bad film. The production values are as poor as you can imagine and the plot (something about retrieving  a flying saucer from the clutches of the enemy) pretty damn ridiculous. Yet, the first time I saw this film several years ago I absolutely loved it. The jokes center on booze and sex,and needless to say,Dean Martin handles them as only he can.  As far as Matt Helm films go,""The Silencers"" and ""The Wrecking Crew"" qualify as better ""spy"" films,yet for pure trashy fun nothing beats the ""The Ambushers"". The babe factor is over the top, and  the ribald humour of this film makes James Bond seem stilted and serious. From its cheesy theme song right down to the Slaygirls,this is politically incorrect sixties  camp to the max. Watching it now you'll lament the fact that nobody can make a film this light hearted anymore.  Dean and the rest of the cast treat the whole thing as a put on. A real drive in treat from the go go era; if this film actually had great action sequences I'd have died.",1016928000,5,1062,4.510416666666667
7825370,4,6302413869,"A great many of us will be familiar with the image of Hugh Hefner (Founder and Publisher of Playboy magazine) at one of his famous parties. We can picture in our mind's eye Hef walking around Playboy Mansion in his robe  and pajamas, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other. (Actually, Hef  usually smoked a pipe. But for the sake of argument, we'll say it was a  cigarette.) He's smiling. He's mingling. He's making small talk, with  amusing bon mots and double entendres.
Now imagine that, instead of a  robe and pajamas, Hef is decked out in attire that would have been  fashionably casual for an affluent male in the 1960s. And while keeping  everything else the same (the cigarette, the cocktail, the utterly casual  attitude), imagine Hef in the underground lair of an evil Arch-Villain who  is ready to visit death and destruction across the globe. Oh, and make Hef  a James Bond-esque spy.
You now have the basic feel for the four Matt  Helm movies, of which ""The Ambushers"" (1967) was the third.  (The  others were ""The Silencers,"" ""Murderer's Row,"" and  ""The Wrecking Crew."")
The Matt Helm movies were made as star  vehicles for Dean Martin. By the mid-60s, Dino had cemented his reputation  as a boozing playboy, and the Matt Helm role was written with this in mind.  In the movies, Matt Helm is a boozing, affable, world-famous photographer  of beautiful women who works for ""Slaymate"" magazine (which fits  in nicely with the Hugh Hefner analogy...). BUT THAT'S JUST A COVER!  Helm  is REALLY a boozing, affable super-competent secret agent for the  Intelligence Counter Espionage (ICE) organization. And in all four movies,  he casually wanders his way through whatever the bad guys have to throw at  him as though he were looking for the nearest bar.
I should point out  that the Matt Helm movies are all pretty bad. But they're wonderfully bad,  and they're great, cheezy, campy fun. I tend to speak glowingly of the Matt  Helm movies because I enjoy them for their over-the-top campiness, but more  serious-minded viewers will probably be turned off.
And let me tell you:  THE AMBUSHERS spares *no* expense in the ""campiness"" department.  Try this plot on for size:
The ICE organization is testing out a new,  super-secret flying saucer. That's right, a flying saucer. As MacDonald  (James Gregory), head of ICE points out, if it works it will put the other  planets ""right next door,"" and the rest of the universe will be  ""just around the corner."" It's never sufficiently explained why a  counter-espionage organization would need to go to other planets (much less  the rest of the universe), but no matter. They've made it and they're  testing it.
The test works fine, until the saucer is forced to land by  Mysterious Bad Guys. The leader of the Mysterious Bad Guys enters the  saucer, and the pilot (a female) screams. Fade to black. This all takes  place within the first 10 minutes of the movie.
Cut to Matt Helm, in Matt  Helm heaven. He's helping to train a cadre of new ICE agents who,  coincidentally enough, all happen to be gorgeous, scantily-clad babes. Go  figure. But he runs into a white-haired, crazed woman who thinks all men  are out to kill her. It's his old partner! It's also the woman who piloted  the flying saucer! Will wonders never cease? (Answer: Of course not! This  is Matt Helm!)
Naturally, Helm is assigned to find the saucer, and he has  to take his former partner (who's now recovered) because only females can  fly the saucer. The reason is because the saucer uses ""electromagnetic  fields"" to propel itself around the neighborhood. And, according to  the movie, electromagnetic fields are lethal to males. No, I never learned  that in my basic physics classes either, but there you are.
You can guess  the rest. Typical spy-movie stuff with the usual Matt Helm twist. Helm  still wanders from place to place as though he's looking for the nearest  bar. During one fight scene he gets knocked into a huge vat of beer, much  to his obvious delight. And in a send-up of his singing career, the very  final scene shows him trying to teach an attractive new recruit how to make  love while on the job. The recruit is cold and unresponsive, even after  Helm puts on a Dean Martin tune. But when he puts on Frank Sinatra, she  responds amorously, much to his chagrin.
High points of the movie:
*  The whole ""electromagnetic fields are lethal to men"" bit, which  had me rolling on the floor.
* A couple of male bad guys dying from, as  near as I can tell, turning completely red all over. Even their clothes.  This is, apparently, the inevitable consequence of exposing men to  electromagnetic fields. (Now you know why your Mom always told you not to  sit so close to the TV...)
* The obvious set pieces when Helm is  supposed to be outdoors.
* A set of railroad tracks which leads right up  to the very edge of a cliff, apparently for no other reason than to allow a  railroad flatcar to careen dramatically off said cliff.
* The  *incredibly* cheesy effects, which include ray guns that emit sparks, and  radar towers that emit obvious ""radar"" noises.
* Helm turning  his belt into a sword by the simple expedient of getting it wet.
It's  true that none of the other Matt Helm movies are pinnacles of the  film-maker's craft. But the plot and cheesy special effects make THE  AMBUSHERS a cut below the others. In ranking the four Matt Helm movies in  terms of overall quality, this would be #4 on my list. But in ranking them  in terms of laughs (both intentional and otherwise), this is easily #1.",962064000,25,5552,4.6874350986500515
