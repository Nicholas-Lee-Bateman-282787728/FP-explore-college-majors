4471007,5,B004UT8X56,"An unbelievable documented trip about two guys and there motorcycles riding around the world.  This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It definitely made my motorcycle trips seem a little less exciting, but it's made me strive to be a little more adventurous in life.  Although we may not all have the money to do what these guys did we can at least learn to get off the couch and try something crazy once in a while... After watching this of course.",1313020800,2,467,4.406976744186046

4471016,5,B004UT8X56,"I think I have loaned these out to everyone I know. Long Way Round is a tad better, funnier. Love the interpersonal and practical moments of taking a trip with a group. Love the adventure, story-telling, cinematography, locations, Mongolia, Scottland, Africa, etc etc. A bit of swearing but fairly limited, and one naked Ewan butt (in Long Way Round), so we let our girls (ages 9 and 11 see it). Way better than the violence they see almost regularly now (even in school!).",1446422400,,473,4.710843373493976

4471018,1,B004UT8X56,"Please let me clearly state that I LOVE the 2 shows!! Long Way Round is by far my favorite!
I had read many reviews stating that the US version DVD was incomplete - only having 7 episodes instead of the full 10 episodes. I thought this double set had the full 10 episodes - NOPE!
Even though this double pack of both seasons has different cover art/photographs - don't be fooled - it is also incomplete.
I had initially watched this on N**tf**x & wanted to have my own copy to be able to share with friends & family. I don't understand why some box sets do this, but the US version stops at episode 7 - when there's actually 10 episodes. I had found the Canadian version that was compatible with US DVD players, but the seller I located through Canadian Amazon won't ship to the US. So, found a copy on Ebay & hoping that the picture of the back they posted & the research I have done will help me FINALLY land the entire season of LONG WAY ROUND!
Again, cannot stress this enough - LOVE the show, but the DVD set is incomplete & that is the ONLY reason I am rating at ONE STAR!
Buyer BEWARE!!",1445990400,14,1093,4.184834123222749

4471024,5,B004UT8X56,"My husband got me into Long Way Round when we were dating. His copy got banged up so I got him these for a gift. Halfway through Long Way Down now and love it. I did like Long Way Round better, but I would still recommend either. Just love these guys and their big journeys. Except it makes my husband want to do something like it, which is not something I want him to do haha! But it is a good vicarious trip for any motorcyclist!

4471031,5,B004UT8X56,"The series is absolutely with out one doubt, the best ""trip adventure"" I've seen yet.  You can't help but feel you are there with the entire group making these journeys.  They meet up with everything one could possibly come upon... sand, rain, raging rivers, bikes falling over and over and over, accidents, pain, joy, humor, animals, pests and serious moments as well.  I was totally mesmerized  through out the entire DVD set.  They ""tend"" to begin slow, (ie the first 2-1/2 episodes) as they have months set aside to Plan their journey, and some viewers may find it tedious..... but these moments are filled with disappointment, humor and excitement. Besides it is interesting to see what they bring along!! The two cyclists are off on their own (with one following on motorcycle, filming) for most of the trip.  If you enjoy adventure and certainly if you enjoy motorcycles, I would have to bet that you will very much enjoy this!!!!  Their motorcycle sponsorship build one helluva a bike!!",1407715200,2,994,4.880952380952381

4471037,4,B004UT8X56,The Long Way Round DVD version is somewhat different than the version I saw on Netflix.. It's still a enjoyable show.,1405036800,,117,4.619047619047619
4471038,4,B004UT8X56,"I love the idea that these guys jump on a pair of motorcycles, and drive off to their destination.  But these guys are certainly well appointed with a complete staff for logistics, and backup.  Even though they do meet a couple of guys (one on a pedal bike!) that is doing it on their own, these guys have the money, satellite phones, and two backup trucks.

I'm not saying the trip was not hard, but it was certainly made easier.

Would like to do my own version of the trip, but do the Down Under Blunder and go the long way around Australia.  It would be a fun trip!",1403568000,,569,4.18348623853211
4471039,5,B004UT8X56,Awesome. Cried at the conclusion of LWR. LWD not quite as adventurous I felt. A great watch for both however.,1399420800,,109,4.5
4471040,1,B004UT8X56,"After having watched several programs by and about people who did similar excursions on their own, I can't finish watching these boys with their massive support teams, sponsors and Hollywood budget. Once they meet bicyclists peddling around the world. McGregor complains that he's jealous that he doesn't have the time to do that. With his bank account he could make the time but I'm sure he wouldn't do it without a massive support team and sponsors anyway. Go to utube and watch your neighbor take this trip (unless your from the towns of Palm Beach, Aspen or Beverly Hills).",1396656000,,577,4.838383838383838
4471041,5,B004UT8X56,"Wish I was young (and foolish?) enough to complete this journey myself.  At my age, guess I'll just have to settle for the armchair version.  Just as well, as some of their adventurous route tested men and machine very strenuously.",1396483200,2,231,4.75
4471042,2,B004UT8X56,"I ordered these DVD sets to see the natural surroundings and learn more about the cultures of the countries they traveled through, but unfortunately there was very, very little of that and the filming was mainly of close ups of their faces complaining of how difficult this trip is for them emotionally and physically. I just finished reading Helen Thayer's trek through the Gobi desert and she does mention hardships and pain but never ever in a complaining, self pitting way, she spends most of the time describing the surroundings, the people they met and ways they managed through the challenges. Had those 2 guys documented their trip this way it would have been an amazing story and DVD set. What a sad waste of an amazing opportunity.",1394668800,,741,4.796875
4471043,5,B004UT8X56,"If you love adventurer, or motorbikes, or traveling or Ewn McGregor :-) then you will enjoy both of these series. We started with the first one that was made, Long Way Round and enjoyed it quite a bit. Their adventurous are hazardous and make you feel like you are right there along for the ride.

Long Way Down was my favorite though, because of the interesting people and places they encountered in Africa.

You won't be disappointed!",1393891200,,436,4.64935064935065
4471044,5,B004UT8X56,This DVD set is a must see for anybody that has a passion for cross-tour motorcycle riding. I completely enjoyed it!,1393804800,,116,4.571428571428571
4471045,5,B004UT8X56,"Although I had seen on TV already it was a great enjoiment to watch step by step and image the adventure of this group to make such journey. I am a motorcyclist as well so I can understand entirely what they felt. It was also nice to see that behind the big movie stars, Ewan and Charley are simple and great human beings, not one of those fake figures the were created to make fame, they are real people like us.
Fantastic journey, fantastic videos.

I highly recommend it for every motorcycle enthusiast.",1388707200,,350,4.072463768115942

Funny, engaging, lots of bike talk, but really the best part is seeing the interaction between these two characters.",1380067200,,280,4.470588235294118
4471057,5,B004UT8X56,"I liked the quality of the recordings and the quantity of valuable background information provided for anyone willing to undertake a similar adventure.  By the time I watched both sets of DVDs, I felt as if I had personnaly visited these two continents and experienced the various cultures.  There was nothing I disliked about this film.

These 2 DVDs have motivated me to at least consider making a similar trip through the South American region.

They had me riveted to the screen and up till wee hours of the morning all because I did not want to stop viewing a particular DVD until it ended.

I am yet to view films that have had me hooked as these 2 DVD sets.  Okay, I would have to say it had an interest level similar to Lord of the Rings or Avatar.",1378857600,,756,4.364285714285714

4471061,5,B004UT8X56,"If your a biker, which my wife and I are, and you like Euwen and Charlie you cannot fail to purchase this duo. Great humor from both and great filming on the move by Claudio. Not just about biking but a great historical,geographical and cultural lesson for all ages. The ""Long Way Round"" we feel is the better of the two but you won't be dissapointed by either. We used to go all over the UK and Europe on BMW motor cycles and believe me it will make you envious. Go get it.",1375315200,,474,4.10752688172043

4471064,2,B004UT8X56,"Tough working through these. Was expecting more scenery shots, instead of Mutt and Jeff blundering their way through. Since my husband and I both ride, I thought this would be something we could enjoy an  episode every now and then as we don't watch any regular TV. Could do without tasteless jokes and language, I feel they are sometimes not respectful of the different cultures. I want ""the ride"", not their nonsensical whimsy. It is obvious they could not set out on their own and do this, unlike a married couple that is currently working on riding through 122 countries with NO backup and on their own bikes and dime. This is more like a mediocre reality show with spoiled celebrities. I would not recommend you spend your money on this.",1372118400,2,742,4.66412213740458

The discs are the full season's episodes, therefore a substantial amount of viewing time need be devoted to ""travel"" the entire itineraries. Similar trip ideas in both series, yet the execution could not be more different; in people, places, and experiences. Long Way Round is more about the bikes and how it was done, Long Way down is more about Africa, its people and scenery.

Tip of the hat to Ewan McGregor, Charlie Boorman and the rest of the crews for great documentary work!  This is not ""reality TV"" a la Survivor or some other scripted game show.  This is just a video diary of motorcycle travel around the world.

If you like these shows, then you have to watch ""The Road to Dakar"" about Charlie Boorman's attempt at one of the toughest cross country races in the world.",1356912000,,485,4.540229885057471

4471079,4,B004UT8X56,"I enjoyed these two documentaries very much.  Ewan McGregor is my favorite actor anyway, and between that and my passion for riding, it was easy to get into.

Ewan and Charlie, being who they are, had sponsorships and a crew of people working for them to prepare, along with a support team on the ride.  I really enjoyed the preparation portion of the documentary in selecting motorcycles, packing gear, and their physical prep for a four month trip.

I loved watching them problem solve while on the journey: navigating and slow riding through rough terrain, mechanical issues, and border crossings.  The people they met were excellent and I liked how they handled disputes as a duo.

My comments are mainly meant for Long Way Round.  I enjoyed Long Way Down, but really not as much.  I liked the new experience aspect of Round that is a one-time-only thing.",1353542400,,859,4.756756756756757
4471080,5,B004UT8X56,Love everything about it. I think Charley Boorman is very interesting. Love the clips with family members on the trip as well. The interaction and just the things that go along with dicey places to travel too. They are well rewarded each time. The Russian bits were fascinating for sure.,1345507200,,287,4.76
4471081,1,B004UT8X56,"This starts out with good intentions. Then it goes horribly wrong. They have custom bikes made and then turn them down because the company won't give them to them for free. It's suppose to be two guys and a camera man, but every five minutes you see almost the entire production crew bailing them out of problems. They complain about where they are going to stay and all of a sudden, somebody is putting them up for the night. When they're on tarmac, they complain that they want to be off road. When they're off road, they want to be on a paved road. Scenery is almost knoll & void for a road trip. Save your money and watch one or two episodes on N_____x. You'll be glad yo did.",1343433600,3,680,4.2384615384615385
4471082,5,B004UT8X56,Ewan and Charley are wonderful. Both of these trips made my week when watching and I was so sad when the trips were ended.,1332460800,,122,4.125
4471083,5,B004UT8X56,"If you have ever considered a long ride on a motorcycle, this is an extreme view of what it takes to plan such an adventure. I loved learning about the other countries and their road, or lack of road systems they have in place. I will think twice about complaining about the roads in the US.",1328486400,,291,4.214285714285714
4471084,5,B004UT8X56,"Bought this because I love motorcycles and Ewan Mcgregor. Never thought I'd be as enraptured as I was with the beauty of the various countries and their people. The trials and tribulations Ewan and Charley went through are at times mind boggling and funny. Very envious they had the opportunity to do this trip. Maybe someday... Get this if you love motorcycles and travel documentaries. Think, Anthony Bourdain except with Ewan Mcgregor; the caring, self-deprecating, intense, and moody Ewan no one ever sees elsewhere but for his family and friends. Great shows!",1317859200,4,564,5.141304347826087
4471085,4,B004UT8X56,"Ok so I'll admit, I wasn't super big on this series at first. My wife was really starting to get into it and I finally caved and started watching it on youtube with her. I quickly got sucked in on this amazing journey that Ewan and Charlie take, and without sounding too sensational, sometimes you really do feel as if you are taking the journey with them!

Their banter is totally off the cuff, and nothing (dialogue-wise) seems staged, and yet they both are hilarious! I had never hear of Charlie Boorman before this documentary, but take my word for it - he is extremely funny and totally lovable. It is refreshing to see Ewan McGregor outside of the spotlight...I always enjoy finding out that celebrities I admire have qualities that transcend the silver screen. You can see this by the way he cares for his wife and children, and his genuine love for the people he meets. Also he makes fun of Starwars fans, which doesn't surprise me and makes him even more relatable in my book.

My wife and I normally don't watch things with too much profanity in them, but I have to be honest the vulgarity is missing when Ewan and Charlie curse...we just end up chuckling. That said, parents should probably watch this before deciding whether it is suitable for their children.

My ONLY gripe with this set is that they have taken out parts that were originally included in the BBC episodes and used some of them for ""extra footage"". That said, at least the footage is included, and because of that I can't really complain too much. This is the reason for the star I knocked off, but to be honest it should be closer to half.

Overall, this is a great set. If you haven't seen any of this, trust me when I say that you will want both of them. The general concept is the same, but the experiences are totally different due to the diversity of cultures and scenery!

You will love the heart that these guys share for the open road and the people they meet by chance along the way. You will be jealous, I promise.

Totally recommended!",1316908800,15,2026,4.462162162162162
4471086,5,B004UT8X56,"This is an everyday fantacy that everyone would want to do, I mean just setting up a journey like these.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone that likes the outdoors, motorcycles and being on the open road of freedom.  It is also funny and has some great lessons to be learned also.  These are two series that I will be watching for a long time.

Enjoy",1316476800,,363,4.294117647058823

The one problem I have is that disc two in Long
Way Down does not work.  It has skipped about 1/2 of the disk and going back I can not get it to play.
Great CD stories.",1315785600,,307,3.796875
