6356427,5,B00JF80FU8,I used to watch these on VHS when I was a kid (still have them somewhere actually)  I'm so glad to have some on DVD now so my kids can watch them too.  We really enjoy the episodes and hope one day we can get the others from the series.,1427587200,4,236,3.7

6356429,5,B00JF80FU8,"I grew up watching these bible movies. They tell each bible story in a great way. It is even more entertaining with the three explores that go back in time to a story in the bible. Wish they have more soon on DVD. I would not watch any other brand of bible story collections, because this collection is the best.",1420848000,9,312,4.216666666666667

6356434,5,B00JF80FU8,"I remember watching these Bible cartoons as a child, and I have long awaited for a set of them to be released on DVD. The series originally had 13 episodes, but so far the entire series has not had a DVD release (only a few individual episodes, previously each on a separate DVD release). This set includes the four episodes: The Miracles of Jesus, David and Goliath, Moses, and Noah's Ark. The animation style is very similar to many classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Each episode is just over 20 minutes long. This set contains four DVDs in one case, and there are no bonus features other than trailers for other similar movies. Each episode centers around the three main characters, Derek, Margo, and Moki, as they travel back in time to a different era from the past and meet various characters from the Bible. There is some violence and bloodshed (mainly in the David and Goliath episode), so they may be a bit intense for very young children. This set is definitely worth getting if you are a fan of Hanna-Barbera cartoons or Bible cartoons. I hope the rest of the episodes will eventually get a similar DVD release, as it would be nice to own the complete series.",1406073600,32,1168,4.6201923076923075
6356435,2,B00JF80FU8,"old fashioned -- much not appropriate for kids today. violence, etc. requires much explaining to your kids about how this was a long time ago and we don't do this anymore.  Modern videos are much better about how to present a story to young children.",1490227200,,250,4.555555555555555

6356443,5,B00JF80FU8,I enjoy watching these Bible stories. And it's great for kids to help them understand some of the events that really took place in the Old Testament Bible days.,1466553600,,160,4.551724137931035
6356444,5,B00JF80FU8,"So happy they are on dvd now.they were a favorite of mine as a kid and now I get to share them with my son.
They really present the Bible in an honest way. I like that there aren't things added or changed to try and entertain kids like in Veggietales.
There are time travelers who kind of guide you through the stories but are more witnessing things occur and not actually a part of them.",1464480000,4,388,4.118421052631579

6356452,4,B00JF80FU8,Well these movies were so much better as a kid now as an adult I notice how annoying that Mochi guy is. But anyways it serves it's purpose for my kids to watch Christian movies. The big negative is that it's 4 separate DVD'S not 1 DVD with 4 movies on it so like a VHS you have to change in-between movies,1445817600,4,305,3.935483870967742

8650463,5,B00JF80FU8,"Not 1, but 4 whole episodes of Hanna-Barbera's Greatest Adventure VHS-exclusive series are in this 4-disc DVD set, each episode to its own disc, just like the original videotapes, Heaven knows why in this day and age. In this set, you'll see how Jesus became a very popular Savior as he grew up, the story of David VS Goliath, the story of Noah's Ark over 40 days and nights in a nutshell, and Moses' story leading to Passover coming to be, which ends up a whole lot shorter and more engaging for whole families than The Ten Commandments ever was, just like the Rugrats' Passover special, especially compared to how ABC presents the live-action movie every year at Passover and Easter! Too bad the WB never put the whole 13-episode Greatest Adventure series in 1 DVD set to this day, just these 4 episodes in 1 set, and the Easter Story separately. If you don't wanna wait around for the whole series on DVD, go ahead and get this 4-in-1 collection AND The Easter Story, today!",1523232000,,977,4.556818181818182

8650469,5,B00JF80FU8,"I loved these as a kid and am really glad I found them. My only complaint is that they haven't released the rest of the series, but that doesn't bear on this review as these are excellent. Surprisingly, they're also pretty Biblically accurate, minus a few minor liberties for story-telling purposes.",1490400000,4,299,4.882352941176471
