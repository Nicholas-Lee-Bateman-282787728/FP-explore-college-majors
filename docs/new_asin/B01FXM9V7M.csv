7752123,5,B01FXM9V7M,"Kekkai Sensen is a quick-paced, witty, and intriguing deconstruction of the classic shounen anime. Leo makes for the most endearing protagonist and the cast of heroes and villains and everyone in between leads to a story that is always interesting and often hilarious, while maintaining a purity and charm that makes it, for me, head and shoulders above the rest. Highly recommend.",1474848000,3,381,5.161290322580645

7752125,5,B01FXM9V7M,"best. anime. since tokyo ghoul season 1. So good that if it doesn't get a season two, i lose hope in humanity. Im looking at you Japan and your creepy 50 episode sister-love nonsense.

PS. best opening song of the year, hands down",1473811200,2,230,4.348837209302325

7752128,4,B01FXM9V7M,"Leonardo Watch is a journalist living in the big city - the city of Hellsalems Lot, a place where the human world and demon (?) world overlap. Thanks to case of mistaken identity, Leo finds himself joining Libra, a secret crime fighting society.

This series is confusing, disjointed, and really fun. It also has one of the best ending credit presentations Ive seen :)
Most of the time the show consists of a bunch of vignettes strung together, often introducing new and fantastic parts of the world before disappearing from the show entirely (Im looking at you Prosfair). The characters are colorful and wacky, though there isn't much chance for development. This series is based off of a manga by the same author that did Trigun and it is still running, so this show gets an anime original ending. I actually thought they did a pretty good job of it (which is good, because I thought the series was finished and watched all but the last episode, which ended up delayed from June 2015 all the way to October 2015, though they did kindly make it double length).

I haven't heard anything about a second season, but I still hope that they make one!

PS it seems at the time of this review Amazon's product details is incorrectly listing this as Japanese Audio only. The show has already been fully dubbed and the product details on Funimation's site list this set as having both languages.

UPDATE 11/30/16: Just heard a second season is planed for next year. Yay!!",1465776000,18,1464,4.662790697674419

7752131,4,B01FXM9V7M,"This action packed comedy is a chaotic ride from start to finish with plenty of memorable laughs and great music!
It may only be 12 episodes but it has earned my time and is worth recommending to friends.",1487894400,,204,4.394736842105263
7752132,5,B01FXM9V7M,"A great anime, it doesn't quite follow the manga in that most of it is original and not at all in the manga. Still it's beautiful and BONES did a good job at pulling it together and glad they took their time with it! I watched the series as it was airing and like rewatching it in bits (Lunch Rush Run is the best episode). I love it also the limited box set comes with illust cards which is cool, I wish that one of the DVD covers had Steven instead of Zapp or Klaus but oh well, hopefully he'll make it onto one for the english box set FOR SEASON TWO.",1481673600,,553,3.9464285714285716
7752133,2,B01FXM9V7M,I was very unempressed with this anime. Very chopy story line im not sure how it got so many good reviews.,1479859200,,106,4.095238095238095
7752134,5,B01FXM9V7M,"I'm really picky when it comes to anime, and absolutely loved this one. Wish the season was longer, but we'll just have to wait until the next season.
The dub cast did a fantastic job, one of the best I've heard.
The characters and story are great, and it does a great job balancing action, comedy, and serious moments. It's definitely an anime that I will watch many times over.
Highly recommend it to any anime fans. It also has the potential to be a gateway anime.",1478563200,14,467,4.379310344827586

7752137,5,B01FXM9V7M,"I love this series, it reminds me in many ways of Cowboy Bebop which is my all-time favorite anime.  This Anime series differs from the Manga after from the first 2 volumes with it's own original story and ""villains?"" so no worries about getting one spoiled by the other.  That being said, I did pay up and spent the extra $20 on the ""special edition"" of the series....and I'm not so sure it's worth it.  As far as I can tell, it contains the same extras as the standard edition, the only diference is that it comes in a red box containing the 2 blu ray cases (blu ray and dvd of the series) as opposed to your standard blu-ray case with all the discs in a single case.  Not sure it's worth the extra cash.",1476748800,6,706,4.169117647058823
