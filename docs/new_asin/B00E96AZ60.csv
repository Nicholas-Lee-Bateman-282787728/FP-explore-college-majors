8602830,1,B00E96AZ60,"I grew up in Maine and love Acadia.  I've spent so much time there.  I was thrilled to see that there was a film made about it.  But boy was I disappointed. I could have taken a better video with my iPhone. Plus it seemed like all the footage was taken in one day.  I'm not sure if they didn't have good funding or if they just didn't care, but this film was such a bad representation of Maine and Acadia.  I'm sad I wasted my money.",1388016000,10,433,3.9310344827586206
