5689659,4,B00C3ALL9O,I really enjoy the blend of action movie with graphic novel effects. Even if you don't want to follow the story line (which you will) the cinematography is outstanding.,1373328000,,168,4.827586206896552

5689662,4,B00C3ALL9O,"""Tai Chi Hero"", the sequel to Stephen Fung's ""Tai Chi Zero"" has arrived on Blu-ray and this time around, the series is about family honor!

But like any sequel, can Stephen Fung's foray into martial arts film by giving it a stylish 3D style in combination with wicked wire work and camera sequences to go along with contemporary music, you wouldn't expect anything less from Stephen Fung.

The film was planned as a two-part film with ""Tai Chi Zero"" released in China in September 2012 and its sequel ""Tai Chi Hero"" released in January 2013.  But with the events of this second film, it may seem as the film may become a trilogy.

VIDEO:

""Tai Chi Hero"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio). Picture quality is very good with very good detail for the canons. Colors are natural, closeups showcase detail and really good clarity and for the most part, I didn't see any problems with white specks, banding or artifacts during my viewing.

The film does have its stylish moments and its use of trying to bring that video game feel to the film.  Where it was overdone in the first film, fortunately this is not the case with ""Tai Chi Hero"".  There are some moments where Fung tries to bring that video fighting game style to the film but I was pleased that this was toned down for the sequel.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Tai Chi Hero"" is presented in Mandarin and English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. During the action sequences of the film, there is a good use of the surround channels and LFE. It's probably one of the more active lossless soundtracks that I have listened to for Asian cinema on Blu-ray, so that is a plus.

As for the English dub, I tend to watch foreign films in their native language which I did with ""Tai Chi Hero"", but I also decided to give the English dub a chance.  And while not my cup of tea, it's a lot better than the older English dubs for Asian cinema that turned me off back in the '90s and early 2000s.  But the English dubbing is not horrible and it should suffice for those who do not like reading the subtitles.

Subtitles are in English, Chinese, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Tai Chi Hero"" come with the following special features:

  From Zero to Hero - Making Of - (1:00:55) An hour long making-of featuring behind-the-scenes, interviews with director Stephen Fung, the talent and crew from the film.

EXTRAS:

""Tai Chi Hero"" comes with a slipcover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I watched the first film, ""Tai Chi Zero"", I wrote about how Stephen Fung had come a long way. From his debut with ""Sing si Poon Goon"" in 1989, his role in the 1999 film ""Gen-X Cops"" which generated interest in Hong Kong's young and up-and-coming stars. Fung, Daniel Wu, Nicholas Tse and Sam Lee were individuals who brought youth and a new style of Hong Kong cinema to a new generation.  These guys were like MTV and cinema combined, music, style and young adulthood that was the epitome of Hong Kong cool!

And with the success that Fung and Daniel Wu had in the last decade, the two went on to create their own production company, Diversion Pictures. And like the two have done earlier as actors, style and rock n' roll once again comes into play with their new film ""Tai Chi Zero"".  But is that a good thing?

Wanting to get away from the previous Tai Chi martial arts films and create something cool for a new generation of audiences, at that time, Fung and Wu wanted to create the film in 3D, incorporate steampunk elements (using impressive technology during a time when technology was not practiced by regular people) and provide a visual flair with special effects and modernization.

I felt it was overdone in ""Tai Chi Zero"".  While I always appreciated Stephen Fung wanting to be creative, bringing style and music to martial arts, the problem was that the original film was trying to incorporate elements from many films.  From your traditional epic war film, your martial arts film and even a superhero film like the ""Incredible Hulk"", it's not always an easy thing to take in.

From the introduction of the film, the crew literally turns the martial arts genre upside down with its hip-hop/rock soundtrack, its use of animation in the intro., a protagonist who gains supernatural powers and using silent cinema with no verbal acting (for a short while). It's a style that I have never seen in my decades of reviewing martial arts films but while there is part of me who doesn't want to see things to modernized and filled with popcorn action over story, the fact is that a lot of films are becoming that way and if you want something traditional and storyline-based, there are always the martial arts classics.

But for those open to modernization and for something different when it comes to martial arts, ""Tai Chi Zero"" was different.  It incorporated a steam punk element, a lot of action and a lot of humor.

But despite the different approach to a martial arts film, ""Tai Chi Zero"" was a popcorn action film at best.  Many celebrity cameos, many special effects and too many things that made the film seem like a video game.  But if anything, too much incorporated visually and not enough to its storyline.

With the sequel ""Tai Chi Hero"", it looks as if Stephen Fung may have been told to simplify things and make a coherent story.  While the first film tends to focus primarily on Yang, this time around, the film focuses on the family.

Grandmaster Chen Changxing (portrayed by Tony Leung Ka-fai) has much more of a presence as a father.  Concerned for his daughter Yuniang but also seeing great promise in the son-in-law to be... Yang, but also having to deal with his estranged son Zaiyang making a return and wanting to become the leader of the house (despite not knowing martial arts)  and now having to deal with the East India Trading Company who is now more intent to finding ways to make the villagers move in order for them to build a railroad.

The story is much more comprehensible, there is not a focus on Yang going crazy.  If anything, Yang plays an important part primarily as a representative of the Grandmaster Chen's clan.  This time the story focuses on integrating a storyline that utilizes Grandmaster Chen Changxing, Yuniang and Yang together.  And that is a very good thing as a talented actor such as Tony Leung Ka-fai is utilized much better.

There are also less flashy gimmicks.  Yes, you will see graphic elements that play out like a video game but not too much.  You will see computer graphics show up on screen, but very few times.  If anything, the focus is on the action and the weaponry created for this film.  From giant cannons, mechanical devices and an air vehicle.

But because of the many battles in this film, people are going to enjoy the action scenes so much more.  Great wirework, great use of one-on-one-combat and if anything, a martial arts film with modern elements done much better than the first film.  I found ""Tai Chi Hero"" to be satisfying, action-packed and exciting.

As for the Blu-ray itself, picture quality is fantastic and wonderful detail on close-ups to the mechanical design for this film. The lossless audio is crystal clear and great use of LFE and surround channels during the more action intense sequences. And you get a making-of special feature over an hour long.

Overall, ""Tai Chi Hero"" is a sequel that improves over the original with a focus on a coherent story and exciting martial arts battles. You also get Stephen Fung's willingness to incorporate modern elements such as a rock track and flashy CG but not thrown in for the sake of being thrown in like the first film.  And last, better use of its characters!

There is no doubt that this film will now become a trilogy after the events of this second film but I do look forward to it!

For fans of the original ""Tai Chi Zero"" or fans wanting something different in a martial arts film, ""Tai Chi Hero"" is a film worth checking out!",1372896000,3,7915,4.612857142857143
5689663,4,B00C3ALL9O,Im confused is this the third movie in the series or the 2nd because i already got tai chi hero a long time ago and the dvd cover is completely differnt. its def the same series but i got got mine like 6 months ago and got tai chi zero a few months before that.,1372377600,,261,3.7636363636363637
5689664,5,B00C3ALL9O,I ended up watching this one day when I was bored.  The movie is really well done with a blend of comedy and action together.  If you decide to watch this one be sure to watch Tai Chi Zero first.  The first movie is more comedy but it is also really good.,1370908800,14,255,3.8653846153846154
5689665,5,B00C3ALL9O,"Well Go USA has become famous for releasing films that appear to have a 100-million dollar budget, but are made for considerably less. ""Tai Chi Hero"" is no exception! LOTS of action and some really unbelievable machines, including the flying variety.

The Kung Fu is realistic-looking (well, o.k., except for the flying part!), but not overdone.

Never a boring moment; nice English dub, too.",1370736000,,392,5.109375
5689666,5,B00C3ALL9O,"If ""Tai Chi Hero"" is anything like the first film ""Tai Chi Zero"" it should be a winner.  We know from the previews that it is the second part of an extended story but I have the feeling it will stand on its own two feet and do a terrific job of that too.

Well Go USA have given us in the past twelve months some amazing films beautifully presented as only they can, and I look forward to this film from them also.  In fact I cannot wait to see it.

If you have not purchased ""Tai Chi Zero"" yet do so and wait as eagerly as I am for this second film which you can pre- order now.

July 2nd cannot come soon enough.",1368316800,4,614,3.8412698412698414

5689680,2,B00C3ALL9O,"There is a lot of effort for making this movie, which is what the 2 stars are for.  The rest, Tai Chi is a well balanced way, but in the movie, the people are either unbalanced and can still stand up, or anti-gravity that they can just rise up the sky.  The ending credit song is a crazy song as well.  It really doesn't go well with what Tai Chi really is.  It is somewhat mimicking the movie ""Wanted"", with the butcher fighting, but is done as a 20 second clip with not much real substance.  In the movie, you get the ""KO"" for Knock Out or ""Energy Level"" going low, beep, beep, beep, sort of like a video game or comic book.  I suppose this movie will go well with the audience who are 20 year old, who get excited with KO, and Energy Level Low, beep, beep, beep kind of situations.

It also is very cliche: a guy with round glasses that looks like a prodigy, some evil people drive a big steam machine into the village, they want to build a railroad through the small village, some evil guy bringing in canons to attack the village people.  It is way too much cliche in the movie.

I recommend Jet Li's Tai Chi Master instead, which is a much better made movie.",1444608000,,1164,4.160714285714286

5689686,4,B00C3ALL9O,"Very fun movie!  I've watched both of ""Hero and Zero"" in this area and can't wait for the 3rd installment!

What I liked:
- Fast paced
- Good plot
- Good characters
- Funny

What I didn't like:
- The video game aspect of it was kind of juvenile.  They would insert video game pop ups that didn't make any sense.

Summary:
In the end it was a fun, past paced movie with a good story line.  It kept moving, developed characters and plot very nicely.  It made me laugh also which can never be a bad thing.  If this is moving towards a new Hollywood genre of martial arts then it's moving in the right direction.",1436832000,2,608,4.136752136752137

The story follows right after the first film ends & it also does a nice job of recapping for those that haven't seen the first movie. I personally enjoy Hero a bit more then Zero but I feel both films are very good & fun to watch. There is supposed to be a third film to complete the trilogy & if its as good as the first two, I for one cant wait. The cast once again I feel deliver very good performances as well.

My main complaint against ZERO was the lack of any notable martial arts sequences. Well in HERO, we get to see more form and style, and we are given two lengthier martial arts fights, both within the last 40 minutes of the film. I was also more drawn into the story for this one. Yes, it is a continuation of the plot elements from ZERO, but I was also able to get more invested in the main characters and their emotional subplots and such. It was great seeing the village Grandmaster, his daughter, and the Idiot team up to defend against an attack, then later the Idiot-cum-Hero has a final fight scene to gain access to the Prince, who will ultimately offer aid. I liked the mythology of the origins of Tai-Chi, and the continuing themes of the advent of technology.  Speaking as an old school kung-fu film head, this film could have been even better with more actual fighting. It would have been nice to have seen at least two or three of the Hero's final seven challenges (or was it just six?)  in their entirety instead of just quick edits and snippets? In any case, HERO was a much more satisfying movie experience for me than its predesessor. As I understand it, a third and final installment of this movie series will one day grace our receptors?

(4.) Great contemporary tie ins - some classical pop music; then some metal or rock; then some computer game animations.  A good spoofing, at times,
of the martial arts genre e.g. with the fruits and veggies or when the moves were following the cooking style of each meal. Great steampunk tie in. Great da
Vinci tie in with regards to his design and innovations e.g. the flying machine.
(5.) Great wire acts and martial arts - imaginative wire routines with Tai chi juxtaposed to Kung fu movements; nothing ridiculous just to fill space but instead used to educate as to the philosophy and aesthetic of the movements.
(6.) Great acting -yet nuanced, understated performances in keeping with Tai chi philosophy.",1378771200,4,1072,4.732620320855615
5689735,3,B00C3ALL9O,This book interested me with the unusual photo on the cover plus it is part of a collection. I have not read it yet.,1378684800,,116,3.875
5689736,3,B00C3ALL9O,"This movie is tongue-in-cheek, sometimes with ""Batman"" blurbs across the actors' faces. This is its saving grace. The Tai chi is indeed grogeous to behold, but the fights are just plain silly. There's no real acting to speak of, and I found NO ONE I wanted to root for.

Visually it's pretty good, like about a 7 out of 10. There's no story to speak of and the ending is predictably silly. The worst thing that sticks in my mind is a character named Fleming, whose supposed to be this unctious evil Capitalist Brit. He waaayyy over acts in a drawn out boring manner, and---weirdly---he does not have a British accent but tries to fake one and it just falls flat. He sounds more chinese. You'd think somebody would have caught that?

Tacky cgi

Too much ""flying"" kung fu tactics. I had a brown belt in Shoto Kan Karate; it was designed to smash through samurai armor with one blow. All this slapping and kicking and jumping around in Kung-Fu, I don't get it. A real Shoto Kan warrior would have just stepped in and broken ribs with one punch. Me---I never had that ability, I'm talking better brown or black belt who did could do that.

But---see? There's no drama in that. Hence: Kung Fu. Lots of leaping and flipping, arms waving, etc.----good visuals for the movies :)

Movies aren't real, kids.

Except for THE MATRIX; that was real s*** :)

Anyways....

Yes, held my attention; there's something electric about the director's presentation. See it and enjoy it :)

5689737,3,B00C3ALL9O,"The first time I watched this I kinda fell asleep.  Nothing really stood out to make this sequel any more interesting as a follow up to the first film.  But, a few weeks later, I let myself watch it again and I found that I was right the first time at not being too entertained by this follow-up.

If anything, the scenery all looks fabulous, but there was not as much comedy, which to me, is good, therefore having a little more serious approach to the continuing story, only made the story drag more.  Really, there wasn't very much action in this film.  Just a lot of mediocre banter between everyone. And cool scenery. But, that's about it.

I need to slow down on just buying Well Go USA Blu-Ray releases because the trailers look good, but I'm beginning to get some real duds quite a bit more often.",1377993600,,805,4.369127516778524

5689739,5,B00C3ALL9O,Very entertaining story depicting the life of Yang Lu Chan and his studies of Chen style Tai Chi in the Chen Village at the turn of the century. Although probably not historically accurate it still is great fun and portrays his spirit and character in a positive light. Definitely a good movie and a must see for anyone into Tai Chi and martial art cinema.,1377561600,2,356,4.492307692307692

5689747,5,B00C3ALL9O,"Finally being able to kick back and watch the sequel to TAI CHI ZERO was a major treat; truly a dazzling film! I thought TAI CHI HERO was better than the first in every way, with more story, amazing fight choreography, beautiful locations and a first-rate story to wrap up the story started in the first installment. I was really surprised by the amount of emotion packed into this film, a jail sequence in particular was especially moving.

Everything looked and sounded great on this release, picture was outstanding. I was very entertained with this film and didn't want it to end. Thankfully a third installment will be on the way and it should prove interesting considering the Stormare sub-plot. Chinese fantasy lovers are really going to dig this film. Nothing too heavy, just the right amount of fighting and some fun machines. Bravo!",1375228800,7,842,4.847222222222222

5689750,5,B00C3ALL9O,"Back in January, I reviewed a steampunk/martial-arts hybrid film titled TAI CHI ZERO (click here to read that review [...] which is the first of a trilogy.  I complimented the film on its originality and fast-paced action.  The second film of the trilogy, TAI CHI HERO, is available now and is definitely a worthy follow-up to the original.  With higher stakes and even wilder fight scenes, this second film will have you begging for the third and final film to come out!

I can't decide if I like the first or second film better.  Both are excellent in their own regards and have high re-watch factors.  But both also have their own distinctions.  The first is revolutionary with its story; I believe it is the first ever steampunk film to integrate martial-arts action.  But the second film broadens the storyline and introduces new characters, along with new threats and villains.  This is accomplished while keeping the original plot in place, making for a cohesive and enjoyable sequel.

TAI CHI HERO is shot well and the acting is great.  But what really makes an impression on the audience is the action.  I never get tired of wire-work when it is well done, as is the case here.  The kicks are high, the punches are fast and the fight choreography reaches new heights.  If you're not breathless after watching the final battle, then you probably don't have a pulse.

I like how more back-story is given in this film as well; we find out more about previous happenings in regard to Lu Chan as well as the Grand Master of the village.  This is integral for the story, as it shows us who they really are as people.

The steampunk in TAI CHI HERO is amped up a bit as well.  Instead of a mechanized steam-powered tank, we get to see a steam-driven flying machine.  This is interesting because the craft resembles a sketch of Leonardo DaVinci's I once saw at a museum.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but it made me grin nonetheless.

TAI CHI HERO is a true win for me, and I cannot wait to see how the third and final film shapes up.  The very ending of this film gives us an idea of what to expect, and WOW...I'm literally on the edge of my seat just thinking about the possibilities!  I highly recommend giving this film and its predecessor a look.",1375142400,19,2267,4.502450980392157

As a kung-fu film, it had a good amount of fights and great effects, 4 stars.  As a story, it was weak in that a kid gets a bump in the head at birth and he must find the Tai Chi master at a far away village to teach him how to control his chi so that he doesn't die from this bump if he can't control his anger or his powerful fight spirit.  His challenge is that the Tai Chi master doesn't accept students from outside the village and he must convince the master to teach him Tai Chi.  It just so happens that the village is going through a challenge of its own, and that is someone who is western educated from the village has convinced the government to run a rail road system through the village, which would destroy their culture and way of life.
