In ""Perfect Opposites,"" Drew and Julia, two college grads from ""a school in the Midwest,"" decide to head to L.A. to start life together as a committed couple (not much of a move, as it turns out, since the college scenes were actually filmed at USC).  However, in no time at all, the pressures of trying to establish their careers, combined with Drew's innate fear of commitment, end up putting a serious strain on the relationship.

""Perfect Opposites"" is a fairly conventional romantic comedy that does at least offer a few flashes of insight into the complexities of man/woman relationships, even though the motivations for some of the characters' actions are strangely arbitrary and inscrutable at times.  Nevertheless, as the complications arise, we find ourselves identifying with the two main characters more than we expect to at the beginning of the story.  Unfortunately, the film insists on parading a bunch of cutesy L.A. stereotypes before the camera, severely undercutting the sense of reality it establishes in the scenes between Julia and Drew.  There is one very funny scene in which Drew's old college roommate lays out his theory about where men and women fit in the evolutionary scheme of things, but the film doesn't achieve that level of comic cleverness very often.

As Drew and Julia, Martin Henderson and Piper Perabo make an attractive, likable couple, and the secondary performers do what they can with the characters they've been handed.

""Perfect Opposites"" is a hard film to call because it feels both artificial and realistic in roughly equal measure.  It takes a slightly more mature view of the world than most films of its type, building to a final scene that is a tad more thoughtful than what we are accustomed to in a romantic comedy.  For that reason alone it deserves some recognition.",1107734400,4,1830,4.970491803278689
2156524,2,B00049QJ9S,"Ok, it was a little fun to watch the moview industry make fun of itself by setting the film in L.A. and viewing Hollywood from a legal point of view.  But that aspect if the film was paper-thin and underdeveloped.

Our main characters graduate from an east-coast type college and head to L.A. with ideas if long-love and riches.  As they hit rocky times finically, so does their relationship.  (...)  (Why is it that every romantic comedy uses the same cut-n-paste mold for 30-something married couples?  It's so old it's down right boring.)

They both act like jerks to each other (but him more then her), they split up, realize they still love each other, and SUPRISE, get back together.  However, the get-back-together scene at the end is hollow and empty (although perhaps more realistic) and left my chick-flick loving wife feeling robbed of the romantic moment when they run back into each other's arms, cry and kiss, and ride off into the sunset.

In a nut shell, don't bother.",1106611200,2,984,4.741176470588235

I watched it because Piper Pierabo is in it but this in very early in her career and she is not the same actress as in Covert Affairs.  There is no one else in it that you know.",1333324800,,299,3.671875

8036181,3,B00049QJ9S,"Perfect Opposites shows a romantic comedy that focuses on just how lousy, inconsiderate, and dishonest some men can be.  It's also a film that doesn't really have *any* good storytelling qualities whatsoever.  Even the laughs are few and far between.

The character who portrays the man of the relationship is shown as a complete moron most of the time.  It's amazing just how clueless and moronic he is whenever he's around his girlfriend.  He doesn't *deserve* to be in a relationship.  Anyone who's that clueless honestly doesn't deserve such a hot girlfriend.

At least his girlfriend is able to read between the lines and see every single one of his blunders.  After all, anyone who goes out of his way to impress a girl, ultimately dragging her into a situation she doesn't belong in nor WANTS to be a part of absolutely *deserves* what happens at the end of the film.

Other than that, the storytelling throughout the movie is basically pointless because it's so dull.  Who cares what the point is?  Most of the characters are boring, including all the main ones.  The storyline tries to focus on the man and woman living together and starting a life together like any other normal people, but it's not particularly interesting either.

I'm only giving Perfect Opposites 3 stars out of 5 instead of a big zero because it did try to actually go somewhere some of the time, and of course, for the unintentionally cluelessness on the part of the boyfriend.  Avoid.",1273017600,6,1468,4.773809523809524
8036182,4,B00049QJ9S,"Better than you'd expect. The cast is pretty. The script is a little above average. The plot, well, you can't have everything. You'll see it all coming. This one is about looking at the beautiful people and watching them go through their antics.",1216771200,4,245,4.72093023255814
8036183,4,B00049QJ9S,"This movie is a must-see for all teenagers with a romanticized view of relationships.  Perfect Opposites is funny as well as realistic in its portrayal of the ups and downs of intimate relationships.  But if you like feel-good, cliche' fairy tales, you might not like this one.  It's similar to The Break-Up.  Piper Perabo and Martin Henderson are adorable as the lead characters of the film.  The rest of the cast is great too.",1154390400,3,428,4.72972972972973
8036184,3,B00049QJ9S,"This is another love story that is just OK.  I can't really decide what went wrong for me, but I know that the stars of this movie are much better actors than this. Piper moves across country with her boyfriend (Artie Lange).  She gave up family, a job, etc., for him.  What happens?  He decides to leave her and Piper is left heart broken.  Piper moves on and marries someone else.  Artie is crushed that Piper has married because the longer he is away from her, he realizes that he really can't live without her.  Piper divorces 3 years later and their friendship rekindles.  Will the 2nd time around be better than the first time around?",1144022400,14,640,4.456896551724138
