2746940,5,B000MTEFOG,"Can't imagine giving Scooby-Doo anything but 5 stars.  My 4-year-old son, as well as my husband and myself, LOVE Scooby-Doo.  It is something that adults can still enjoy.  This DVD has 5 episodes.  I like the Pup versions because I never saw them as a kid, so they are new to me, and are no less quality than the original Scooby-Doos.  The picture quality was never enhanced from the original versions, so it isn't that great.  But, if you like Scooby-Doo, it is no big deal.",1340150400,,475,4.465116279069767
