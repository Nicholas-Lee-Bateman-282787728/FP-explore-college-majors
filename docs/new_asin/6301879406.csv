7816523,3,6301879406,"A writer and a bounty hunter camp overnight together by chance.  They tell each other scary Old West stories.  Tho the two are fine actors, the tales told were pretty dull, uninspired and simply not well written.  I wasted my time, and I was looking forward to watching this since it looked like it would be real good.  They could have done better.",1400544000,,348,4.476190476190476
7816524,3,6301879406,"This film has so much potential and promise, but, unfortunately, it is light on pay off and reward for viewers. The premise follows two men in the open country of 19th century America retelling stories at a fireplace. Grim Prairie Tales combines horror anthology with Weird West, and it features two talented actors as the dueling raconteurs; what could go wrong? Four underwhelming stories, poor cinematography and a lack of horror and suspense are what went wrong in this movie.

The film begins with a bespectacled, formally-dressed man on horseback setting up camp and a fire in the evening on an old prairie. He is soon approached by a large, burly and wildly dressed man with a gruff, deep voice, a quick temper and bad attitude. The former man introduces himself as Farley Deeds (played by Brad Dourif) and claims he is seeking to reunite his wife after she left for a family emergency. His new acquaintance is named Morrison (played by the impeccable James Earl Jones), a roughneck who claims to have spent the last year in isolation out in the wilderness.

They begin chatting and introducing themselves which leads to bickering and resentment; Morrison sees Deeds as a weak and overly naive noob to the countryside and Morrison seems like an untrustworthy cad or worse to Deeds. Eventually, they agree to recount tales that they have heard of the area. Deeds specifically requests horror stories and Morrison obliges with two grim tales followed by Deeds attempting to do the same. These scenes between Deeds and Morrison are the highlight of the film and this would have been a potentially excellent film had the rest of the script featured the wit and punch the scenes of these two conversing and slowly developing some respect for one another did.

The first story is a warning against disrespecting sacred grounds as an old man (Will Hare) faces severe consequences for cutting through Native American burial grounds. The second story is about a young man (Marc McClure) who meets a beautiful and very pregnant brunette (Michelle Joyner) with a dark secret. Deed's first story is about a group of settlers (led by William Atherton) who must contend with a violent mob on a manhunt. The final story involves a slimy cowboy who might be haunted from the men he has previously gunned down. I cannot help but not give away the conclusion to these four stories but you will probably see them coming a mile away. These tales are technically grim but they are not scary or frightening.

If only this film could have maintained the quality in the stories within a story that it had while depicting the two travelers, perhaps this film would have been a near-classic. Kudos to Dourif for portraying the neurotic city slicker with unease and creepiness and Jones who was dynamic as the feral and mysterious stranger. Some actual horror or suspense, less murky cinematography and better developed stories would have made a world of difference in this overlooked film. The movie is more a ho hum version ""Amazing Stories"" or ""American Playhouse"" than ""Creepshow"" or ""Tales from the Crypt."" Instead, ""Grim Prairie Tales"" is a fair entry to the anthology, western or horror genres but nothing to write home with a quill pen about.",1346198400,,3230,4.877959927140255
7816525,4,6301879406,"I saw this movie on VHS in the early 90's and found it to be very entertaining for those who like the unusual and strange.  This western type of movie starts as a ""normal"" western which then turns into a story which reminded me of the movie The Illustrated Man where what happens next is very unexpected.  Enjoy and I hope this comes out on DVD soon since it has been out in VHS for many many years but is still enjoyed by many.",1344729600,4,428,4.083333333333333
7816526,4,6301879406,"i really like this, a great thing to watch with with friends who only like westerns when i like a little horror!",1234828800,,112,4.136363636363637
7816527,3,6301879406,"For such a distinguished actor, James Earl Jones has made some really forgettable movies, and I would count Grim Prairie Tales among them.  This 1990 anthology piece seems to have garnered decent reviews, but I personally can't see how this movie could impress anyone.  Just because it's different - a horror/Western anthology which eschews the standard formula of ""it is the story, not he who tells it"" (i.e., the two storytellers are more interesting than the stories they tell) - doesn't mean it's very good.  Without the overpowering presence of James Earl Jones as an uncouth, darkly mysterious range ride, I daresay Grim Prairie Tales would border on the unbearable.

Brad Dourif plays Farley Deeds, a squirrelly-looking, city slicker-type who looks and dresses like he should be running away from the Headless Horseman rather than traveling alone through the desert.  He's all set to turn in for the night when a stranger disturbs the peace and quiet of his little campsite - a veritable mountain of a man with a strange air about him whom Deeds doesn't exactly welcome with open arms (in his defense, the stranger does arrive with a dead guy draped over the back of his horse).  Morrison (Jones) is a strange one, but the two eventually bluff and argue their way into a round of storytelling.  Aha, you say, this is where that whole ""horror"" part kicks in, especially when both fellows start talking about stories that will make bats fly out of your ears.  Well, I hate to break it to you, but an impressionable five-year-old kid wouldn't take fright over anything these stories have to offer.

Morrison opens up with a story about some old coot who foolishly decides to cross over an Indian burial ground at night, followed up by a strange tale of ""a good man"" who comes to the aid of a pregnant woman out wandering alone.  Given the campiness of the second story in particular, Deeds thinks he can do better and gives us a sort of morality tale in which a wife and daughter try to deal with the father's participation in a monstrous human act - unfortunately, the rather dark print of the film leaves you a little unsure of the specifics of that act.  Morrison, obviously more impressed than I was with Deeds' story, then sets out to top it with the story of a gunslinger haunted by one of his victims.

Morrison and Deeds are much more interesting than the stories they tell, but I didn't find these two men all that riveting.  Their exchanges are far too theatrical to make me forget I'm watching a movie - James Earl Jones is great, but Dourif seems to spend most of his time over-acting.  With its anthology angle, Grim Prairie Tales is certainly different, but I found the movie to be average at best.",1198713600,,2716,4.666666666666667
7816528,5,6301879406,"Those expecting this movie--which should be on DVD--to scare them will go away disappointed.  None of the stories the two men tells is particularly frightening.  What they are, though, are insights into the moral character of the men telling the stories. And, what makes this film so good is the dead body sitting on James Earl Jones' horse while the two men joust across the campfire.

From the beginning we identify with Brad Dourif's nervous city slicker crossing a lonely expanse.  When bounty hunter James Earl Jones arrives with a person he has killed, we ""know"" who we're supposed to root for.  Yet, as the stories progress and the interaction between Jones and Dourif's characters deepens, we come to see that their moral positions are not as black and white as things might seem.  And the final scene really emphasizes the moral ambiguity of both men.

All this is played out in an atmospheric, if low-budget, landscape.  This is a very subtle and appealing movie that repays repeated watching.  It is extremely well acted by the two leads, and each of the characters in the 4 stories within stories are also well drawn.

All in all, an absorbing way to spend an evening.",1130803200,12,1180,4.768472906403941

7816530,3,6301879406,"The problem with most anthologies is that you cannot put much characterization into them, and some stories are just plain better than the others.  Dourif and Jones' storytelling antics were more entertaining than the stories they told, it was nice not to have Jones sitting behind a desk somewhere bellowing in his famous voice.  Here, he MOVES, and is very good.  The finale leaves something to be desired, I only slightly recommend this film.",981417600,,444,4.972972972972973
