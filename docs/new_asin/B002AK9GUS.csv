8359565,4,B002AK9GUS,"I have five Korean movies, all purchased on the basis of what I read in the comments, but, more to the point, based on my thoughts. I have been quite happy with each purchase I have made. I consider each movie to have been a good buy. We will always get losers who are not happy with any movie. But, I have never been deceived by any decision I have made in buying a Korean made movie and as such, I will continue to buy them. Overall, what this lengthy statement means is that this is a very good movie. You will like it and enjoy it, just as I did. FORBIDDEN QUEST is for you. Buy it. You'll be glad you did.",1397088000,2,610,3.967479674796748
8359566,5,B002AK9GUS,"I'm a big Kurasawa fan and have watched a lot of foriegn language films which defiinately helped me appeciate this movie.  The plot developes kind of slowly but like all good things it is worth the patience it takes to let the movie develope and evolve and finally conclude with one of the best finales that I can remember.  If the oriental mind set and life style found in quality historical cinema intreagues and iinterests you and if you like ""Seven Samurai"" more than ""House of Flying Daggers"" I think you will love this movie.  Character developement can be very humerous, surprising and satisfying when done with style and intelligence as it is in this movie.  The subject matter makes it a little difficult to recommend this movie to friends, not everybody is amenable to accepting pornography as a ""repectable"" subject for a film but if you can subdue your moral judgement a little and accept that sex is a part of life that needn't be discussed only in hushed tones then you may come away with a more balanced outlook and acceptance of all things that make us the human beings we are.",1358899200,11,1093,4.618556701030927
8359567,5,B002AK9GUS,"This movie is extremely unique.

Pros: Contains the genres of Comedy, Action, Romance, and Drama
all in one movie.

Cons: There is not much depth to the plot. However, that is expected from a comedy. The pacing of the movie is slow.",1331856000,4,232,4.5
