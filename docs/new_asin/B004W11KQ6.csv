8444265,5,B004W11KQ6,I can say with confidence that Nat Young has and had one of the greatest front side cutbacks ever along with Wayne Lynch. Just an unbelievable film about the major change going on in surfing in '69. It is so insperational to anyone who sees it for sure.,1359763200,,253,4.291666666666667
8444266,1,B004W11KQ6,Too bad they had to mess with the original movie. I waited to see the scenes of Margerette River only to see stop action shots and a lot of footage seemed to be missing. They only showed Wayne Lynch doing one off the lip and I remember my old VHS copy having at least 6-8 really good waves with off the lips by him and Keith Paul. Is there a real copy of this movie anywhere? I was going to buy 5 summer stories but I heard they even took a lot of the sound track out of that DVD. Bummer.,1334102400,,488,3.8415841584158414
