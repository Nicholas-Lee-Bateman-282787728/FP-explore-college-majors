Why in the world, after you've put your spouse in hiding and the bad guy still manages to uncover that location, and then he manages to get away after killing a good guy, would your take your spouse back to your home? It just doesn't make sense. And how come the home of police officer, who knows a killer is after his wife, doesn't even have a barking dog for security?

 Patrick Duffy, for those of you who are too young to remember the Dallas tv show, is a very nice looking man, with some great muscles, who couldn't act well enough to be in a porn flick. William Devane has been around a long time and played many roles. Even when he's a good guy he can give you the creeps. In this movie he's great at positioning sound devices, killing people, knowing intimate details about the lives of his victim and, even if he was in a coma, could out think Patrick Duffy's character.

Around the time this movie was made someone discovered that a muted trumpet gave some kind of atmosphere to what your were watching. 15
minutes into this movie I was sick of them.

 All-in-all this a poor attempt at film making.",1521331200,,1235,4.352173913043479

8057738,5,B00096S2ZA,"Murder C.O.D is a fast-paced and very exciting tv thriller movie with two one of the greatest actors in B thriller's as
 Patrick Duffy and William Devane. The plot is original and tell's the story about a cunning hitman(William Devane) who
 random selects his clients and victims. He then commits the murder without the beneficiary's knowledge and sends them an
 invoice for $100.000 with a threat that nonpayment will result in being framed for murder. Seasoned Police Detective Lt.
 Murtaugh(Patric Duffy) must outwit the clever executioner in order to salvage both his job and his self-respect.

 In my true opinion this thriller compare with some other great thriller movies is one of the five best thrillers's who I ever
 watched in my life. I would recommended everyone to watch this sharp-edged thriller who like this type of genre.
