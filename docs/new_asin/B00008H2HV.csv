This is the second feature film by Carlos Carrera (director) and Ignacio Ortiz (writer), but it's not as good as their first film. The reason as Ignacio Ortiz the co-writer explained to me, they put in the screenplay so many things, that they forgot why they wanted to make the film in the first place ""Married Life... is a Hell"".",1518393600,,469,4.595238095238095

8162425,5,B00008H2HV,"Director Carlos Carrerra's more well-known and controversial romance in the Catholic church, El Crimen del Padre Amaro (Crime of Father Amaro),  La Vida Conyugal (Married Life, however, is a dark comedy with a take on married life of Jacqueline (aka Magdalena) and Nicolas, who vow they will be in love together for life until death do they part, or infidelity, whichever comes first.

The characters are memorable, dialogue is entertaining, and the plot progresses with a fast pace.

The movie begins with the future and Jaqueline writes in her novel about her marriage to Nicolas, a well-to-do businessman who immediately begins having affairs.  We see through the decades that Jacqueline retaliates by having sex with other men, in the hopes that she can convince these various men to kill her cheating husband.

The funny humor begins when Jacqueline nonchalantly makes arrangements with her various sex partners to kill her husband, but something never quite works out each time.

This 1993 film is well-done, subtitles are good, clear, concise and there are no extra features on the DVD. There is brief nudity.  Worth an evening of entertainment .........Rizzo",1183334400,,1166,5.2032085561497325
