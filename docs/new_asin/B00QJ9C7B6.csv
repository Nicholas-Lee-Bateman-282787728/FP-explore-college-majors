6871611,2,B00QJ9C7B6,"This is a terribly directed and written film about a very IMPORTANT ISSUE. The issue is how oil companies, mainly Shell Oil, have operated in Nigeria, and how Nigerian government corruption allowed that to happen, while Shell Oil took advantage of a situation. Shell did or was suppose to clean up all oil spills, even those caused by third parties, those who break into oil lines to steal oil, for example. But as the movie depicts, Nigeria was prohibited from refining its own oil. You can read about the newest litigation called ""Shell Fights Lawsuits Over Environmental Record in Nigeria""  2016, many news agencies released this.

Excerpt:

"" It is a point Shell has already contested in The Hague, where four Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth successfully appealed a ruling that was largely in Shell's favor last year, allowing them to pursue a case against the company in the Netherlands. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday.

Last year, the company said it experienced on average nine oil spills a month caused by sabotage or theft, with a handful of additional spills caused by operational issues. An uptick in violence this year has knocked important export terminals out of action for months at a time, though divestments onshore have helped reduce the overall number of spills Shell has recorded.

Shell blames the spills in the legal cases on third-party interference, like sabotage and theft. Under Nigerian law, the company isn't required to pay compensation for spills caused by sabotage or theft. It also points to illegal refining, a source of pollution in the region that is unrelated to the company's infrastructure.

Shell also maintains that it cleans up all oil spills, regardless of the cause.""

Anyway, it's sad the film wasn't more polished. It's almost comical in some places, or like Rourke's  hair that looks like a greased back straw broom. I was like, ""What is his hair supposed to depict?"" The script moves too fast and leaves out most all details of oil production and government corruption, even in its explanatory phase.

I could only get through about 20 minutes because this is an important issue that deserves better.",1479600000,6,2181,4.953424657534247

Just because companies that are nothing but greedy; the less fortunate voice(s) go unnoticed. Here I am in the uSA going about my business, while companies in the USA do business of foreign soil and care more about money than a human life. USA is on the verge of total destruction because we have replaced God with greed and selfishness. It is October 22nd, and we will soon be electing a new president.

6871967,1,B00QJ9C7B6,"This movie was actually well made, not bad cinematography, overall it might even deserve 3 stars in those areas, but the entire story is built on the premise that big oil is so evil because of the outcome of the incidents that occur in the story line but it's all misdirection from the true culprit. The real culprit was how the Nigerian Government misused it's power to take care of problems and not that these so-called evil big oil companies were willing to pay money to their government to try and fix their pipe lines. The big oil companies did not dictate how their government fixed the pipelines that was their decision. The director attempts to paint the picture that big oil is so bad and evil because these situations exist but that is complete bull crap! The Nigerian Government could put safety laws and regulations in place like the U.S. and other Governments have. In the U.S. we have big corporations that exist just to keep safety and regulations in check one called O.S.H.A. is huge and takes billions of dollars in fees every year and no company in the U.S. can build anything unless it adhere's to such standards or suffer huge fines. The U.S. Government can not dictate to Nigeria's Government how their companies choose to maintain and produce things, if they did a shoddy job and their people suffered because of it how does this make big oil companies look bad?!?!? Seriously, how? Now if they made the culprit appear to be the Nigerian Governments actions this movie might have some merit but what they've created is an obvious crybaby liberal attack on big oil companies. Well, all I can say to this film is boo-hoo point your finger at the real bad guys in this story (Nigerian Government) and stop trying to blame things on problems that don't exist.

Significant production value is wasted on weak writing, marginal acting, and no story other than that which covers a superficial political motivation. The film seems to indicate that the methods of Gandhi and MLK do not to work when facing a kleptocracy and multinational corporations. Based upon the subject matter, the movie likely could not have been actually filmed in Nigeria (though they were careful to only refer to some ""head of state"" rather than a leader by name), but it does seem to have been filmed in Africa. Women figure prominently on both sides of the story, though the actor's performances range from good (the primary activist) to abysmal (the reporters).

Believe this or not. The declining middle class, bulk of white Americans are finally seeing this too and are revolting-in an unconscious way by following 1%er buffoon/bigot non-leader Trump or Truth Teller Sanders. Just yesterday, at various points across the globe and America, there were 350.org peaceful demonstrations and civil disobedience against Fossil Fuel industry and its dirty political supporters who are killing off our future as well. This household has Alaskans and Alaskan Native and this non Hollywood ending (not all kissy, happy)  was authentic. Don't choke on your popcorn kiddies.

6872120,5,B00QJ9C7B6,"There is so much that we take for granted.  Black November gives the backdrop about the business of the oil companay, specifically the SHELL Gas Company.  When you watch the television you may see several mishaps pertaining to oil spillage, remember the Exxon Valdez spill?  Picture this, there is a spillage within a concentrated area within your State, City, or Town.  Black November tells about how the spills and promises of the SHELL Gas Company has and is affecting the Niger Delta and the people of Nigeria.

While the oil continues to spill the livelihood of the townspeople are suffering.  Due to the effect that the oil is having on the water supply the people are unable to bathe, drink, cook, etc now imagine if this was your State, City or Town.  As you are picturing this, now look at how it would affect your family particularly your children.  If this happened personally to you and your family what would you do?

In the U.S, the SHELL Gas Company states that things have been cleared up and  the gas flares has been extinguished but the film shows that this isn't true.  For the mess that the SHELL Gas Company caused they offered bags of rice for compensation.  The people of Nigeria is suffering at the cost of us having the ability to have gas throughout the world particularly the U.S. The next time you pump your gas begin thinking about how your usage is affecting those in around the world and at what cost.",1455408000,15,1432,4.594488188976378

6872136,2,B00QJ9C7B6,"This film could have been a realistic depiction of Nigeria and the public and private corruption that have plagued this country from the beginning of it existence.  I was particularly annoyed that so many American actors did not do there homework before agreeing to such fiction that will be taken by many as truth, even though there were disclaimers at the end of the film.  Early in the film protesters complain that oil companies are taking their oil and exporting it without having built any refining capability within Nigeria.  Then there is an explosion of a badly leaking large pipeline that kills many people who have surrounded the trying area of the leak in attempts to steal the leaking oil.  However, afterwards the explosion was described as a gasoline explosion.  It there was no refining capability within Nigeria, there could not have been a gasoline explosion as gasoline is a refine oil product.  This was a hint of things to come from this film.  This film does depict some areas of the corruption of public officials and other Nigerians of influence as if it is shared by oil companies.  Unfortunately, the film does not go into depth about how insidious and how high this corruption reaches within the Nigeria government.  Yes, oil companies accept a certain level of corruption as it is their business to explore and produce oil.  But it is not the responsibility of oil companies to assure that the majority of profits the Nigerian government and it officials skim off the top is distributed reasonably within Nigerian society.  It is a terrible situation, but this film does not properly portray the size and nature of the problems within Nigeria.",1428192000,3,1671,4.890070921985815

6872144,3,B00QJ9C7B6,"""Black November"" (2012) is directed by Jeta Amata. This film is fictional but based on the real problems in Nigeria surrounding its often corrupt governments and oil drilling practices. Evidently 90% of the Nigerians earn an average of $4/day even though it is something like the 8th largest oil exporter in the world with a population of over 174 million people (7th in the world, highest in Africa). The film's name is based on the month (November 10, 1996) of the execution of Ken Saro-Wilwa who fought the government and oil companies regarding the environmental issues. However the film is not about Wilwa and focuses instead on a fictional female character who in some ways paralleled Wilwa's life. The film alternates between Los Angeles, where a kidnapping of a CEO (Mickey Rourke) is taking place by Nigerian freedom fighters, and events in Nigeria leading up to the hanging of the female environmentalist. The film has its moments and has a fair amount of action but it comes across as a bit stiff and conventional. This film was originally released as the 2011 film ""Black Gold"" but was rereleased as ""Black November"" with about 60% of the scenes reshot and additional scenes added so as to make it more current.",1425859200,7,1223,4.856459330143541

The story is told as a flashback showing that Nigeria is ripe for revolution. Impoverished people are facing a corrupt government, a greedy oil company, and a press that feeds off of misery, although that last part was poorly developed.

This is a sad story of despair promoting the revolution predicted by Marx. The language was a little cliche in showing us that the rebels are all justified and the government and oil companies are all corrupt. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) a western educated Nigerian attempts to lead her people in peaceful protest as the story centers around her.

8691514,4,B00QJ9C7B6,"Significant story about the power of a woman and strength as leader. Fiction can tell a lot of truth. I Only wrote this to balance the bias.
Yes, the movie is not a blockbuster but it is reasonably made and the content of focus is told quite well, Many reviewers who have not endured cruelty by corruption have downplayed it's significance. As one born in the West, I hope that the lack of blood & brutality from government and corporate interest not being in our streets does not dehumanize others fate. After all, we ALL bleed red.",1500768000,2,533,4.505154639175258
