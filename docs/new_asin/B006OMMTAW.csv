5010764,5,B006OMMTAW,"COLUMBUS CIRCLE is one of those under the radar films that is actually a tidy little thriller with some predictable and other clever twists.
Directed in a pseudo-noir style by George Gallo, the intricate plot centers on an alleged agoraphobe whose mysterious past places her in danger from a murderer and a deadly con artist.  To avoid spoilers, suffice to say everyone's not quite who they seem.
Selma Blair brings an off-kilter aloofness to her role as the recluse; Amy Smart and a strangely serious Jason Lee do well as the new penthouse neighbors; Beau Bridges is the kindly benefactor, and the always interesting Giovanni Ribisi is the persistent detective trying to put the whole thing together.
COLUMBUS CIRCLE is like a Brian DePalma thriller without the flash, but I liked it and would recommend it to mystery buffs.",1333670400,,825,4.9352517985611515
5010765,4,B006OMMTAW,"This story had interesting twists and turns. I was quite shocked at the end how it turned out. It certainly kept my interest up.

Still I knew someone who is agoraphobia. This woman did not strike me as having agoraphobia. Overall I think the movie has a few loose ends, would a reclusive person look so pretty, what exactly was she running away from and since the detective knows so much could she get away so easily?

Some of the characters, I thought were over the top too but it is a movie.

The acting is good. Selma Blair played well as did Beau Bridges.

The filming I liked.

Worth seeing.

Update: Although I have never done this, this film made me think a lot about it so I bumped up my rating from three to four. It is a good film.",1332720000,4,742,4.190140845070423
5010766,2,B006OMMTAW,"After watching Columbus Circle I have to say I suspect that the early good reviews posted on this site might be from people who are involved with the film.  Story about an agoraphobic young woman (Selma Blair) whose elderly neighbor is killed is one of those twisty thrillers where all the twists are ridiculously predictable--I figured out everything that was going on in this movie about 10 minutes in.  There are some good performances by Selma Blair, Giovoni Ribisi and Kevin Pollack that keep the movie watchable, and there are a few amusing lines, probably courtesy of co-writer Pollack but as a thriller this thing is a complete dud--it's too slow and too predicable and it generates absolutely no suspense.",1332633600,8,714,4.941666666666666
5010767,3,B006OMMTAW,"An elderly woman is murdered in her apartment and it is made to look like an accident. Abigail Clayton (Selma Blair) is a recluse who lives across the hall. She wants to rent the apartment to ensure her privacy. The film sets her up as the suspect killer in this murder mystery as she knows the woman better then she lets on, has a motive, and Abigail is not her real name. She is apparently the daughter of wealth who has disappeared but is able to maintain a privileged life while in hiding. Kevin Pollak is the building bumbling concierge who is Abigail's go-fer. Beau Bridges is a friend of the family, her only contact. Giovanni Ribisi plays a detective investigating the death. He has his suspicions about Abigail, the only suspect at this point.

Selma plays an excellent recluse with nervous fidgets...perhaps a bit overdone. As the film progresses the murder mystery becomes secondary as there is a far more sinister plot going on. More suspects are introduced but as the body count progresses, we run short of suspects. Interesting finish and to be honest I didn't see it coming. Unfortunately the film has a made for TV feel to it.

5010769,1,B006OMMTAW,"I thought this stank. The acting, the camera work, the plot. Poor Beau Bridges seemed as desperate to get away from it as I was. I hope they didn't spend a lot of money on this drivel but I suppose they probably did.",1331769600,,216,4.046511627906977
5010770,1,B006OMMTAW,Terrible movie.  So predictable.  Even a monkey can figure out the ending in the first five minute's.  Save your money for anything else!,1331769600,,137,4.869565217391305
5010771,5,B006OMMTAW,"An elderly tenant on the penthouse floor of Columbus Circle is found dead, seemingly a slip and fall. One detective is not certain however and decides to investigate further. While getting statements, the detective discovers the other other resident on the penthouse floor, living across the hall, is somewhat hard to get in contact with. She does not seem at home at first, but rumor has it that she has not been out of her home for 17 years. No one really knows the mystery behind  it. After the incident, she tries to get the penthouse across from her, but someone new moves in, bringing back not only memories but setting a series of events falling, like dominoes.

Before reviewing the movie itself, I want to say that the previews I saw of this movie did not do it justice. They looked grainy and had bad sound quality, making me wonder if I should watch it. An obscure distributor added to that, and if it would not have been for the cast involved I might have missed a good film. This is Not reflective of the film itself.

As for the movie, Columbus Circle was really good. The plot was not overly complex but was not just there to find. you needed to watch it for a bit to figure out all the pieces, and it made me want to keep up with what was going on. At first, you have a bunch of random items popping up and wonder how they all fit together. Was the woman murdered? Who is the neighbor? Why does she act the way she does? They seem connected by circumstance but the pieces start to slide in place, showing threads that hold everything together. This leads to how other elements fit in and interlock, and it makes something enjoyable. Combine that with some stuff toward the end that played out a bit different than I thought it would, marking that as a pleasant surprise.

As far as acting here, it was quite good. I liked Selma Blair quite a bit, enjoying her portrayal as a shut-in with a mysterious fringe to her. There were some details that I might have attributed to the role as well that were not meant to be, from the way she carried herself to the application of make-up that seemed a little too thick. She really seemed to have an issue with the outside world, taking to the shadows and staring at the floor, reminding me of people I have met that are really uncomfortable with people intruding on their surroundings. Giovanni Ribisi was also good in the role of our curious Detective, moving the story along and keeping it on point. He also seems somewhat the same to me in movies, not in a bad way, but I kind of know what to expect from him. The neighbor portrayals, by Jason Lee and Amy Smart, were also well done, and Beau Bridges and Kevin Pollack also played characters that stood out as theirs but did not overshadow what was transpiring.

If I were going to attribute a flaw, I might put it on the end. I am NOT going to spoil anything here, but want to note that a series of events in the last few minutes made me think they went against what we knew had learned throughout the film. Still, it was minor and did not take away from the film.

I don't want to say a solid 5 stars, but it is not 4 either. 4.5/5 puts it somewhere between like and loving the film, saying it was worth the watch. There is a small amount of violence int he film, but mostly you are dealing with a mystery/suspense playing out.",1331596800,10,3339,4.325878594249201
5010772,4,B006OMMTAW,"""Well this is Columbus circle sir, nothing seems strange around here."" Reclusive multi-millionaire heiress Abigail Clayton (Blair) has been living alone in her apartment for almost 20 years. When her neighbor dies she is upset that new tenants have moved in. When an ugly incident introduces Abigal to her new neighbors the lives of all involved begin to change. I have to say that this is normally the kind of movie that I love. A great cast where all their lives are intertwined with each other in some way. A movie that keeps you guessing at the motives of everyone and just when you think you know what's going on a twist is thrown in. This is another type of movie that to talk about it would give away something that would ruin the enjoyment of it so I will just say that this is a must see movie that you will enjoy. I really did. Overall, a great thriller full of twists that keeps you guessing. I give it an A-.",1330473600,16,920,4.354651162790698

It has been slim pickings lately on streaming movie because I've seen all those worth watching. Friday night boredom, I reluctantly decided to watch it. The beginning starts off a little slow but it gets better fast and the rest will leave you on the edge of your seat. Great acting, great plot!

5010781,4,B006OMMTAW,"I knew Jason Lee was in this before I started watching, but not much else about it, so kept seeing one by one, characters appear and thinking hey that cop was also in My Name is Earl.  That guy was Earl's dad and so on. Basically this movie is a chance for some of the actors from that show to have a sort of reunion film making experience.  Amy Smart's character even kind of reminded me of Joy Turner.  It's not a bad movie but you can understand why it isn't more well known.  Basically Selma's Blair character is a woman who has never left her apartment or been seen in person for the whole 11 years or something the concierge has worked in the building.  An old woman has just been murdered across the hall in the only other penthouse on that floor of the building. She reluctantly opens the door and talks to the NYPD detective, after he threatens to come back with a court order and other people.  There we learn a little bit more about her and that he labels her agoraphobic.  We later learn she relies on Beau Bridges character to bring her groceries and stuff and that she wants to move into the old lady's apartment.  However a couple (Jason Lee and Amy Smart) get the place.  Their loud arguments quickly escalate into violence in the hallway.  Will she open the door to help an injured woman and let someone else besides the NYPD detective see her for the first time in over a decade.  If she does, what are the consequences for doing so?

Mild spoilers from the following statement - When learn what the plan is by various characters, each one seems to be a complicated one that could have been simply accomplished a much easier way.

Still it's a decent enough viewing, maybe not a movie you'd watch over and over again, but good none the less.",1476316800,,1759,4.358895705521473

5010784,5,B006OMMTAW,"Watched this because it happened to be on TV. As I was about to change the channel, I saw actors I was familiar with, so I figured I would see what the movie was. After about 5 minutes, even though usually at that time, a show I watch daily comes on, I skipped my usual show because the movie sparked my curiosity. The movie turned out to be a lot better than I anticipated it to be. It kept my interest, as it became apparent that multiple sketchy things were taking place in the movie, and it seemed uncertain as to who everyone truly was, and their motives.

I hate when reviews are just a summary of what happens in a movie. It just ruins it for me. So I won't go in to details regarding the plot. I'll just rate the movie . I give this movie 5 stars. Perhaps a 4. I may have just liked it better BC I watched it for free lol!!",1469059200,,831,3.9760479041916166

5010797,2,B006OMMTAW,"Okay, so start up with a good setup and premise, and instead of working it slowly, the film crams everything down our throat so that it doesn't make much sense at all.  Add to it some terrible acting (Selma Blair, Giovanni Ribisi as a cop?, Kevin Pollak,  Jason Lee), some terrible editing and incredulous scenes, and by the end, it is so utterly stupid that it drops two grades.

What could have been an intriguing Neo-noir thriller tries too hard to ""surprise"" us with wrong turns and detours.  Instead, it becomes below-standard rubbish.

I was tempted to ditch this after the first 15 minutes, but felt compelled to watch it through till the end to see just how awful it could possibly get. Where to start... atrocious acting, paper thin plot that's consistently implausible, disjointed scenes, dialogue that makes soap opera sound like Shakespeare. There's nothing remotely clever or interesting about this movie, it's more like a series of the worst film cliches clumsily strung together.",1388880000,2,517,5.094117647058823
5010811,2,B006OMMTAW,"Eh. I knew the ending almost from the beginning. Jason Lee was hardly believable as a hardened criminal, murderer. He couldn't seem to shake his character from ""My Name is Earl"". Amy Smart delivered a weaker than usual performance as well. Selma Blair did pretty good but that could be just because she was looking pretty darn good. The ""plot twists"" are so predictable that they are not even fun. As a matter of fact they can't even be called plot twists when you see them coming a mile away. Everything you think is going to happen happens. There's no real bond with the characters. When the concierge dies from a bus hit and run I about walked away, so freaking dumb yet sadly predictable given the movie I was watching. The ending is one that will leave morons going, ""NO WAY! I never saw it coming!"" and intelligent people shaking their heads. Any suspense that could have been there at the end is quickly dissipated by Samm Levine who was probably the worst pick they could have made for that role. So glad this was on Netflix so I did not end up buying it!",1384214400,,1063,4.428571428571429
5010812,2,B006OMMTAW,"Script and dialogue are so bad. Directing also gets the boot.  The cast, excluding Jason Lee,  is stellar but still can't overcome the script flaws.  Selma Blair,  and Giovanni Ribisi, who are top notch actors, give the film some substance. Kevin Pollak and  Amy Smart are  fairly adequate : Pollak is co-wrote the script however so gets demerits. Jason Lee and Beau Bridges are way too smarmy and give away the plot twists with overacting. It felt like the actors got together and just did a one time run-through and filmed it in friends' apartments.  There was a very low-budget feel to everything. Even the hairpieces were ludicrous. The music was reminiscent of old Hitchcock films.
Storyline: An agoraphobic, reclusive heiress depends on her doctor and the concierge of her Columbus Circle building to handle her affairs while she nurses psychoses left over from her traumatic childhood victimized by her violent father.  First big plot hole: so why after 20 years locked in her apartment does she open the door to help a new neighbor whose husband is knocking her around in the hallway......instead of, say, calling the police or the helpful concierge, etc.?  People start dying and cop Ribisi should have added some tension trying to connect the dots, but is sleepwalking through the part.

5010825,5,B006OMMTAW,I bought this movie for my uncle because I knew he'd like it as much as I did. Super speedy delivery and the DVD was in excellent condition.,1352332800,,140,4.035714285714286
5010826,3,B006OMMTAW,"I enjoyed this film. It holds up well until the very end and then breaks down considerably. Most of the action ( dialogue ) takes place in two fabulous apartments overlooking Columbus Circle, a truly beautiful spot. The main character hasn't left her apt in 12 years ( similar to Sigourney Weaver's character in COPYCAT ). The detective is well played, his partner isn't developed enough. The main character has a doctor friend, he is not developed enough. In fact, the movie could have been longer and had more dialogue. The main character, played by Selma Blair, is good. She is beautiful and interesting enough to carry the movie. Her flashbacks are important, but they start out lyrical and beautiful and then progressively become more graphic; they are not explained well enough. I won't give the plot away, because I was surprised and a bit delighted by the turn of events. But the ending does not follow from what we know of the characters. So I was left a bit disappointed.",1351641600,2,981,4.742690058479532
5010827,5,B006OMMTAW,"I have seen the movie and read the other reviews to date.  If you are looking for a review by a movie critic, skip this.  This review, like all others, is based on personal taste and experience--it is very subjective.

My main interest in this movie is the subject of agoraphobia (literally a fear of open spaces), which it illustrates fairly well. Some reviewers have labeled this anthrophobia, fear of people.  I don't see an distinction here. My wife suffered from this disease for many years.  When the symptoms first became evident, we had no idea what the cause was and it scared the hell out of us.  No one else seemed to know either which made it worse.  I wish that in 1968-1973 there had been a movie like this.  The disease is debilitating.  It is not, as one reviewer put it, ""a case of nerves.""  Lately some doctors have become aware of this problem and in an attempt to educate the medical professionals I can reach some doctors have been given copies of this disk.

If you suffer from this condition, are responsible for the care of someone afflicted, or a loved one has this, please watch this show.  If you don't want to buy it, rent it or borrow it.  The point is if people understand what the disease is they can be more help to the people involved.

As other reviewers ahave complained this movie will not keep you on the edge of your chair but it will open your mind.  I believe some who have taken the time to review this show could be helped by opening their minds.

Thank you.  If I can offer any assistance to the afflicted, please write me at barrie.bracken@hotmail.com",1350000000,8,1595,4.444827586206896

5010829,5,B006OMMTAW,"Originally I rented this movie from one of those kiosks. I really enjoyed it, and hence purchased it.
Service was prompt and production was perfect. What else is there to say . . .",1345334400,,180,4.323529411764706
5010830,4,B006OMMTAW,"Wasn't expecting much, and got surprised.
Nice little film I could recommend to all.
Give it a whirl, I don't think you'll be
disappointed on this one.",1344384000,,151,4.62962962962963
5010831,2,B006OMMTAW,"Because this film was poorly produced and put together, the ending is unintentionally telegraphed early on-- eliminating much of the essential suspense.  You could possibly enjoy it as a ""mystery"" if you're willing and able to suspend belief for a few hours.  Otherwise, be advised to stay away from this mediocrity.",1344297600,4,316,5.176470588235294
5010832,5,B006OMMTAW,"Outstanding! Great acting. Keep you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. Money well spend.

Really good movie about an agoraphobic woman living in New York who is very rich. Good plot and the cinematography is really intense.

Totally unpredictable ending and somehow complicated plot, but we are getting it as we go along. The moral of the movie is that people with some deficiencies are not necessarily stupid.

A must see!",1342310400,2,437,4.64935064935065
5010833,1,B006OMMTAW,"The weak, immature, and frankly tired script sabotages any potential for Columbus Circle to be the thriller that it is marketed to be.  Save your time and money.  Skip this Hollywood turkey and try viewing other above-par thrillers like Italy's ""The Double Hour"" or France's ""Roman De Gare.""  Not recommended.",1342051200,,309,5.14
5010834,5,B006OMMTAW,"Very Good Story. Not the same old tired and worn out garbage. Worth a look, if you want to see a thriller, with a twist.",1341705600,3,120,3.84
5010835,3,B006OMMTAW,"I was expecting a bit more. There wasn't enough character development, esp in the case of the cops. Just when you feel like you know what's going on, a few more characters get knocked off and the film is basically over.
What I liked most about this movie was Abigail's cool apartment. If you're interested in interior design you should see this film just to get a look at it.",1341100800,,375,4.371428571428571
5010836,3,B006OMMTAW,"This plot had the potential to be a really good first class thriller.  Instead it was kind of a predictable story with a predictable outcome.  A rich heiress becomes a recluse.  Why?  There are all these flashbacks to her earlier life as a hoola hoop queen with an evil father and victim mother.  By the way Selma Blair an excellent actress in my opinion plays the heiress, Abigail who has lived in this expensive apartment for almost twenty years without going outside.  A murder occurs across the hall involving an elderly woman who is the victim.  She's visited by a detective with a lot of questions and then the next thing that happens is a married couple moves in.  He's an abuser, the wife is the victim, and guess who comes on the scene to help--you guessed it, Abigail herself.  There's also a building supervisor involved.  Another character in the mix is a doctor who not only is Abigail's guardian and protector he also happens to be the physician to the old lady who was killed.  How does this all play out?  Well it would've been nice if there were more of a background into Abigail's life other than the brief flashes that occur periodically.  She was also engaged at one time.  Whatever happened to that guy?  How did her mother die?  How did her father die?  How come this doctor became involved and why are all these events happening almost twenty years after this woman disappears?  There are a lot of tense moments and violent scenes in this movie so I guess all is not lost but I think it could've been so much more.",1339977600,2,1537,4.507246376811594
5010837,2,B006OMMTAW,We've seen posh grifters fooling eccentric rich hermits before.  Ditto for detectives just a half step behind the pile of bodies. Every one of these actors is too good for this material.  Is this the best they could get or were they all upside down on their Malibu mansion mortgages?,1339372800,2,283,4.64

5010839,5,B006OMMTAW,Such a great film with many twists and turns. It's not as deep as say American Beauty- but it def makes you think and keeps you guessing! Has a great ending though- highly recommended!,1337472000,,184,4.4411764705882355
5010840,1,B006OMMTAW,"The film reflects the shallowness of too many of today's film writers.  It is too neatly put together, and halfway lame in its predictability.",1335744000,3,142,4.916666666666667

Wish I could watch it all over again not knowing the details it was so exciting!,1528243200,,289,4.178571428571429
8502084,2,B006OMMTAW,"Okay. So it wasn't the worst movie I'd ever seen. There was even some talent in it (though where was Robert Guillaume? I kept waiting to see him show up and he never did, even though he's in the top 5 credited by Amazon) but it didn't show. Selma Blair can be funny. She wasn't, here. Jason Lee can be funny. He was just one-dimensional dark, here. Giovanni Ribisi was the bright light, if there was one, (and Kevin Pollak was pretty good, too) but he didn't have much to work with. The piano soundtrack was repetitive, obtrusive, and distracting. The plot seemed complex (lots of plot twists, but they're all predictable) in a high-school-audience kind of way. It's not particularly suspenseful, though there were a couple of decent (not great) startles. Like the plot twists, (predictable about 20 minutes before they happen) one could usually predict the startles about a minute before they happen. Still make you jump, though. Characters are hardly believable to begin with, and the twists they go through discard believability completely.

Most people will find this predictable, and the music obtrusive. If you're easily confused by plot twists, and can never anticipate what is going to happen next in a movie, this might keep you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack will still probably annoy you, though.",1522886400,,1317,4.879464285714286
8502085,3,B006OMMTAW,"Mediocre acting by mediocre actors (sans Bridges) in an incredibly predictable script. Fell asleep once and still knew where the storyline was. Domestic violence scenes but  surprisingly, barely any swearing and no sex scenes. Bravo for that!",1522454400,,242,5.54054054054054
8502086,5,B006OMMTAW,"We love love love this movie! Have watched it a number of times. The actors are all just superlative in their craft here; I don't see how casting could have improved one jot. Selma Blair surprised me. She was delightful in Legally Blonde with Reese Witherspoon, and I didn't really know if she could pull off a serious role... but she is excellent in this... very believable in the role of a highly disturbed but caring character. I can guess a lot of endings to movies (I always amaze my family) but I did not see anything unexpected coming in this thriller! Just one twist after another. It's just so well done. I highly recommend it.",1519430400,,636,4.491379310344827
