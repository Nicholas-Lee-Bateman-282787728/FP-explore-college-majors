2196492,5,B0006V6T6W,"Now that the battle between Athrun and Kira is over, Athrun decides to join Kira in a battle to save Aube. In that moment, Athrun throws away his previous hatred of the Naturals and begins his search for the correct end to the war. This is a true asset to the Gundam Seed series. A true- Must See. Gundam Seed is an excellent add on to the previous Gundam series. Two Thumb WAY up!!",1115510400,,382,4.175675675675675
2196493,4,B0006V6T6W,"I have not seen this movie, but I have watched the episodes on Toonami. I loved the series. The character and their emotions are depicted perfectly. It pulls you in. You see one episode then you want to see them all. I think this is great even though I have not fully seen it.",1106611200,,276,4.12962962962963

8043569,5,B0006V6T6W,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1355356800,,786,4.581560283687943
8043570,5,B0006V6T6W,"MSG Seed Destiny had a great kickoff with the Armory One Battle and Junius Seven Incident. As the series progressed it began to lose its touch. However, the fast paced action is back when the Archangel and Minerva have to defend the Zaft cities from the Earth Federations Destroy Gundam. Then, the all waited battle between Kira and Shinn take place. This is a great volume to add to your MSG Seed Destiny collection.

However, after this volume the episodes begin to go downhill because most of the story lines are just a rehash of the original Seed.",1219708800,,551,4.622448979591836
8043571,5,B0006V6T6W,"If you like seed, you'll love destiny. As in Seed, there will be sides to the conflict. But here, 3 perspectives. One side that will try to find a solution, and off course, thoughts will go left and right as there are no answers to the questions yet. Look at today's world.
This show is a must, kids and adults can watch it. It's good to reflect on thoughts.",1189814400,,358,4.202898550724638
8043572,3,B0006V6T6W,"MSG SEED Destiny continues to be an action packed ride but at this point the series has started to go downhill

If you liked SEED you probably still like Destiny

the story starts to change as the focus shifts to Kira and company and Durandals goals become clearer.

If you like Kira then this may seem a welcome change but be warned as the series continues you will begin to see more of the same from SEED",1182902400,,406,4.246753246753247
8043573,3,B0006V6T6W,"Well here we are the 8th volume of the sequal to gundam seed. Though this series had an almost painfully slow start it's picking up speed in the last few volumea. The acceleration is still going in this volume which is sad, the last volume's passing was just right and the entire volume feels rushed. It's almost like the director realized that they only have 4 more volumes left and the series is over so they're rushing around trying to finish everything. Still it's not bad but with the rushed episodes stop it from reaching the full potential they could have reached. It was a fantastic chance for them to develope Shin past is self rightous child that doesn't really understand anything phase that makes you just wnat to beat some sense into, and it could have also gone into the complicated political scene and character relationships so on and so forth. Instead they rush you from one fight to another with nothing inbetween. But that's the stroy the entire series. Full of potential but just comes short dew to lack of depth and lack of character developemen and this volume is no different. For those of you who have baught the previous volumes, pick this one up. For everyone else unless you really really need more of the characters from Seed ship this series entirely it's abig let down and this is one of the worst volumes yet.",1181520000,,1340,4.610878661087866
8043574,3,B0006V6T6W,"Plenty of action with a flimsy plot.  This disc almost perfectly illustrates why I like this series and why I loathe it at the same time.  The animation throughout the series is some of the best I've ever seen in a weekly series, almost movie quality. The show really knows how to make a spectacular presentation.

That brings me to the flip side of this coin, the plot. It just doesn't bring you into truly understanding the characters and at some points the philosophy just doesn't hold water. It doesn't make sense.

On this disc, the Destroy Gundam is sent tearing through Berlin and the pilot, who Shinn is infatuated with, is killed by Kira. Shinn solely blames Kira, but not the men who forced her back into that machine in the first place. Also, what was the point of the battle to begin with? To burn down some cities? Meanwhile, Athrun is left without a machine to pilot and seemingly has no power throughout this disc even when his old friends a being attacked and seemingly killed.

In conclusion, the action is well executed, but it seems like they fail to really use the characters to their potential and there never seems to be much of a reason or a point to all of this.",1179705600,2,1186,4.472222222222222
8043575,5,B0006V6T6W,"Mobile Suit Gundam Seed - Eternal Crusade (Vol. 8) includes a superb performance by Japanese voice actress Rie Tanaka in episode 36, who speaks AND sings as Lacus Clyne (and as Meer Campbell) in Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny. In Gundam Seed, Rie Tanaka sings Lacus Clyne songs ""Shizukana Yoru ni"" and ""Mizu no Akashi"" - the latter is the song Lacus sings in episode 36, episode 41, and Movie II. Although, mysteriously, no credits exist in English (they exist in the original Japanese) for the Lacus Clyne songs on this and the other Gundam Seed television series DVDs, these Lacus song credits do exist in English on the Gundam Seed Movie I and Gundam Seed Movie II DVDs.",1145404800,,678,4.658333333333333
