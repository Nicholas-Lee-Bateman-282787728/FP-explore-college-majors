REVIEW

Now this is what reality television was meant to be.  First off, the focus on what the show is about is dead-on.  Sixteen men, who actually qualify to be here, are brought to train with and against each other in hopes of becoming a UFC fighter.  The challenges, in which the winners gain the strategic advantage, are fun to watch and result in some good fights.  The fights themselves would be worth the DVD alone, especially if they include the legendary Light-Heavyweight bout that finished the show (best of UFC ever!).

But with the fights come good drama, and none of it feels forced.  You see, you will learn to love the competitors.  You will appreciate the religion of Diego Sanchez, the cool style of Forrest Griffin, and the intelligence of Nathan Quarry.  You will also meet some unpleasant fighters like the cocky Josh Koshcheck, the bitter Bobby Southworth, and the troubled Chris Leben.  The important thing to note, though, is that even the semi-annoying fighters in the big house aren't unreasonably annoying.  With their attitudes comes real emotions and skills that few of us possess.  These men are not caricatures, but a magnificent study of how the imbalances of egos and skills clash both in and out of that intimidating octagonal arena.

The coaches are Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell (who fought 1 week after the show's finale), who are strong, wise, approachable, and skilled mixed-martial-artists.  Both of these guys bring different but equally effective styles of coaching.  Also present is UFC president Dana White.  This guy is not executive hogwash.  No, this man is not afraid to come down hard on the fighters, and speak bluntly about the 16 guys competing for those contracts.  The only problem is that he doesn a little too much commentating with his interviews, but he is insightful and very smart.

What might the unintiated not like about this DVD collection?

Well, this is a show about fighting.  If you don't really dig boxing or wrestling, then perhaps this isn't for you.  It is a lot easier for me to recommend this First Season as a UFC fan, and martial-arts learner.  But this show isn't about violence.  The 16 fighters, the coaches, and Dana White all make it clear that UFC fighting is a job with no room for uncertainty.  Professional fighting requires calculation, strategy, hard work, mental/emotional stability, and physical conditioning.  I watched this entire season with a friend of mine who hates fighting, but she still grew to appreciate what these men do for a living, and loved that the unfit challengers didn't stick around very long.

This show exemplifies the perfect balance for reality TV.  It's a competition, but it isn't too focused on being a game show.  It's got lots of interviews and fighter-feedback, but is not too interested in the secret alliances or betrayals that have foreshadowed and ruined countless reality TV shows.  The fights are good, but there is even intercut opinions to explain why the fighters did what they did in that ring, and why they were or were not smart with their game plan.  The crew of this show took the time to edit enough so that fight-fans and martial artists could understand the terms and didn't get bored, and also enough so that newcomers didn't feel confused.  I've always liked the UFC, but now I love it.  This show has propelled the Ultimate Fighting Championship to new heights, and has rightfully earned its reputation.  I'm not fond of reality TV that much (except for WWE's Tough Enough 1 and 2...see a connection here?), but ""Ultimate Fighter"" is an outstanding work of television, and has been followed by a good second season worthy of the franchise.  This crew knows what its doing.  I'll even go so far as to say that any fan of TV in general should check this DVD-set out.  You want originality, emotional depth, hard-hitting competition, and non-censored television...you can have it all in one package!  DO NOT PASS THIS UP!",1126483200,34,4042,4.8282387190684135
2383446,5,B000AA4KLA,"There is something radically new about placing potential Ultimate Fighters in a house, training all day and vying for a coveted contract in the UFC. This isn't Survivor or The Real World. The Fighters are only searching for the Truth via the 8-Sided Cage called The Octagon. There aren't wimpy schemes, posturing for the camera, kooks lobbying for an acting career. The Fighters are only trying to compete and win.

Who are the Fighters? Championship fighters Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell, along with UFC President Dana White are there to facilitate and guide the crew to the next level. And these guys really have their hands full, with Bobby Southworth, Chris ""CatSmasher"" Leben, Diego ""Nightmare"" Sanchez and the instant Legend Forest Griffin are all major standouts in the shows reality tv moments. But the entire cast is excellent, guys you care about, surprisingly articulate and definitely original.

Great moments of note: A fighter urinates on the bed of his future opponent to ""mark his territory."" A drunken fighter goes on a rampage and punches a door down enraged after being teased too many times. A fighter loses 30 pounds in less than 3 days, with 20 pounds being ""cut"" in the last 24 hours to make weight for a fight....not to mention some great fights, surprises and villains.

America gets introduced to a true megastars in the personalities of Randy Couture, Dana White and the intensity of the Iceman Chuck Liddell.

Fight fans get to see Mixed Martial Arts(MMA) go mainstream.

The public gets to see the most exciting sport/television today.",1125878400,16,1567,4.988505747126437
2383447,5,B000AA4KLA,"Here's a show that's going to expose a lot of the American public to Mixed Martial Arts.  Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, is a sport that became mainstream in 1993 when the Ultimate Fighting Championship came about.  Of course, the sport has come a long way.  It's completely sanctioned by State Athletic commissions and has set ules and weight classes.  The sport's history is to complex to unfurl here so suffice to say that the reason MMA has become so popular in just 12 years is that it's more exciting than boxing and WAY more real than prowrestling.

Enjoy The Ultimate Fighter Season 1 on DVD and keep watching Season 2 every week!  The finale for Season 2 is going to a feature live fights for UFC contracts just like in Season 1.",1125273600,,735,4.488721804511278

2383458,5,B000AA4KLA,"There's a saying that there's nothing better than the original. While not always true, in this particular case, it was true. The original season had great talent, some of those fighters are still on the UFC, like former light heavyweight champion Forrest Griffin, former No. 1 contenders in different divisions like Josh Koscheck, Kenny Florian, Diego Snchez and Nate Quarry champions in other organizations like Chris Leben (WEC) and Bobby Southworth (Strikeforce), and also, guys like Stephan Bonnar and Mike Swick who have been in the UFC for a long time. While the legendary Griffin vs Bonnar fight at the finale took all reflectors and made the UFC what it is today, there were also remarkable fights on the season, specially the Kenny Florian vs Chris Leben fight, which is one of my favorite fights and represents what MMA is all about, Leben dominated Florian but then Kenny landed a hard elbow that caused a big cut on Leben who was unable to continue fighting, after the fierce battle, both shared a laugh.

And also, the house had it own drama, with Chris Leben talking trash on the house and pranking other fighters, but then Southworth and Koscheck pushed him way too far making Leben lose his cool, going into a rampage and destroying Forrest Griffin's room door, and making Leben and Koscheck (who's one of the top villains in MMA in history) to settle the score inside the Octagon. Also, Chuck Lidell's team most of the time were one step ahead of Randy Couture's team, forcing them to send fighters to Couture's team since at the time, both teams had to be in balance. And this was the show were Dana White's personality was introduced to the world with the now legendary 'you want to be a f***ing fighter?' speech.

This isn't only a great TUF season, but is also a big piece of history of MMA.",1353888000,,1812,4.69496855345912
2383459,5,B000AA4KLA,I love this season. It is amazing to see all the well known fighters in the UFC get their start on this very show.,1303257600,,114,3.7916666666666665
2383460,5,B000AA4KLA,"In 2005, the Ultimate Fighting Championship was in a sorry state. Sold off by SEG due to collapsing pay-per-view revenues, the new owners Zuffa [fronted by controversial president Dana White] were struggling, and ended up fronting ten million of their own money to produce this show for US Cable channel, Spike TV. The rest, as they say, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/history/dp/B004KAB78K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">history</a>, and [aided by a monster of a fight between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest/dp/0061998257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin/dp/0061721727/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin</a>&nbsp;and Stephan Bonnar towards the end of the show], turned MMA into the fastest growing sport since NASCAR.

So this is the show that saved mainstream MMA, and it really is car-crash television of the finest vintage, a sort of cross between Big Brother and Fight Club, with contestants alternating between alpha-male scenery chewing, trash-talking, whinging, crying, and fighting in the octagon. Into the house enter a variety of fighters of varying proficiency and stamina, and stand-out characters include the requisite nutters [yoga-practicing borderline-psychotic Diego Sanchez; emotional wreck and general stirrer Chris Leben; the smug Josh Koscheck; the charming but loopy Forrest Griffin, a man who goes the entire season sporting a nasty compound fracture in his forearm that juts out under his skin], through the most laid-back cage fighter of all time [Stephan Bonnar], a few whingers [mainly Bobby Southworth: a moan and a bully] and on to the cannon fodder who look like deer in headlights [most predominantly Jason Thacker, a man who permanently looks like he's about to have his lunch money stolen from him, and is solely famous for having his bed 'spritzed' by another contestant].

The format of the show isn't perfect- weirdly, a recurrent theme is dividing up the fighters into two teams, presumably to encourage tribal loyalty [and therefore conflict for the cameras], but one that doesn't make a lot of sense when one team loses a lot of fighters over successive weeks, and so is given fighters from the other team. In addition, it's a few episodes before anyone actually fights, as the first few eliminations are via team challenges [in retrospect, the weaker individuals who are punted would have been pummelled by their peers in the octagon, and so perhaps there was an element of logic to this approach]. I'm also a little suspicious of the editing, as [like MTV's 'The Real World'], it's heavily tweaked to construct a narrative, and I'm still in two minds as to whether or not one contestant was the thief that the show made him out to be [I would say probably, but I still have my nagging doubts]. Finally, given the substantial injury rate of this sport, there is a high turn-over of individuals who are put out the show but then return when other contestants are injured.

These points are quibbles: this is a show that gets its hooks in, and due to the unpredictable nature of the bouts [a stray hook, knee, or elbow can end a fight that had been going heavily in favour of the other contestant], doesn't let go. It has a soap opera cast, some blistering fights, and is 'high stakes' for all the players involved. Engrossing stuff.",1299801600,6,3456,5.5790476190476195

2383462,5,B000AA4KLA,"This DVD for sure gets 5 stars because it is a well-packaged/designed box set and it was full of then-unknowns that have now become the faces of MMA fighting.  The numerous discs do not take up a ton of space on my shelf because the box is folded/packaged well.

Now, for the show itself.  It was great to see the struggles of a professional fighter in this sport (and boy do some have it hard) and also to see how much someone can improve in a sport.  This series has it all, from cast backstories worked into the show, mostly exciting fights, great finale, and stellar bonuses on the extras disc.

It was painfully obvious that the producers were still trying to work out the perfect formula/format for an elimination/fighting-type tv show because sometimes they reversed rules, questioned decisions, and had lop-sided teams often needing to trade fighters.
Other than that, you really got to know the contestants, coaches, trainers, and the sport of mixed martial arts!  I highly recommend getting into this series/sport and start it off right with season 1.",1266710400,3,1061,4.802197802197802

Check out UFC 1 to see old school. No weight classes, just show up and fight. The names Gracie, Shamrock, Severn, Frey, Kimo....thats old school, not Lidell and Coutoure. Now, on to the dvd. Im not a big fan of reality tv, but UFC did a great job on the show. Its interesting to see how these guys worked toward their goal of being a pro fighter, the ups and downs of the fight game itself, and how a guy like Griffin can rise up and become a future star in the making. Unlike the people who ""graduate"" from American Idol, these guys actually stick around and become solid pros.

2383485,5,B000AA4KLA,"I had never before followed a reality TV show.  I actually prided myself on never having seen an episode of Survivor or Big Brother - or even American Idol.  Just not into it.

The Ultimate Fighter is more of a behind-the-scenes look than it is a reality show.  It's obviously glitzed up a bit with the challenges and eliminations and all, but it essentially follows these 16 fighters on their potential road to the UFC.  This is in a completely different category than the fluff reality shows being fed to the public over the past few years.  This is something interesting - providing a glimpse into a world most people will never see.

The powers that be at the UFC chose quite a crew for this show.  Right off the bat, you get a feel for who you are going to love (Forrest Griffin, Stephan Bonner, Nate Quarry, Kenny Florian) and who you are going to hate (Josh Koschek, Bobby Southworth, etc...) along the path.  Just like with any group thrown into the mix together, there will be conflict.  Yet there is less than most people would probably expect.  I mean, these are fighters and they come into less conflict than the foolish college students on shows like The Real World.  Their experiences are interesting, as are their interactions with one another.

This is simply an amazing show.  Good drama, good fights, great insight into the UFC and a legendary battle in the live season finale event.  A mixed martial arts fan has to appreciate the closer look we get at Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell in their coaching capacity.  They are both great coaches and very likeable characters in general.  Randy Couture stood out to me, though, as someone who wholly personifies the sport.  Along with being one of the most accomplished mixed martial artists in history, he is simply all that the sport is supposed to be about each time you see him.  I was truly impressed with him on this show.

For a fan of MMA, this is an exciting glimpse into the UFC - the biggest platform there is for the sport.  This show helped to catapult the sport into the spotlight and it is now getting its due recognition.
