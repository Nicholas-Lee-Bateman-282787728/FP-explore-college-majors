8233193,5,B000YKI4FE,"Steak is a sarcastic, hilarious, and surreal movie that lives largely in its own world. It makes fun of  highschool ""nerd wanting to be a cool kid and fit in"" movies and the vanity seen in our society today and twists it into a nonsensical yet relatable story with superbly confused characters.
Alcohol is replaced by milk, plastic surgery is the in fad of the time, sports are now math games, and jokes..... well they have a new type humor to them that is now popular. As an added bonus Kavinsky the 80's styled electro house artist plays the main cool guy for the film.
How can you go wrong??!?!?? Check out this quirky movie and enjoy all of its craziness for what it truly is.... a great comedy.",1363046400,,699,4.4186046511627906
8233194,5,B000YKI4FE,"This movie is not your typical slapstick comedy, and it may even seem a bit slow compared to other modern comedies. However, if you find theatre of the absurd (think Tom Stoppard's ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"") to be absolutely hilarious, you will love this movie. ""Steak"" isn't about a quick succession of witty jokes; it's about the incredibly absurd situations they find themselves in. For instance, at one point a woman in the film is seen at her piano lesson, which consists of hitting one note for a certain length of time, and having her midget teacher constantly say ""No"". The silliness of these situations is what makes ""Steak"" so enjoyable.

Fans of French electro will also enjoy seeing SebastiAn, Kavinsky and Sebastien Tellier in a film by Mr. Oizo. And given that the soundtrack is made by three of the aforementioned artists, you can bet that it's brilliant. The whole film has a 1970's American cult film vibe to it, and apparently it was supposed to be a parody of ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's certainly a strange film, but fans of Mr. Oizo or theatre of the absurd will love this movie.",1280793600,5,1113,4.737113402061856
