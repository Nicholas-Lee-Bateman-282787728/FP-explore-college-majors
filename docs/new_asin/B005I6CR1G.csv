On this one the pictures were chopped off at the top and bottom, the kata demonstrator were not centered and the heads and legs were cut off in some cases. I also thought Miyahira sensei would have performed more.",1355616000,3,334,4.317460317460317
8474283,1,B005I6CR1G,"I just got this in the mail yesterday, 8/14/2012 as it had been on hold.  I was practicing Shido Kan Shorin Ryu under Sensei Iha and thought this would be a great aid.  Surprise!  The video quality was that of an amateur using a camcorder.  The titles did not even fully show on the screen.  Several pictures of Miyahira sensei were cut off at the top of his head.  The ""interview"" was a video with no sound, except a narrator reading a dang TRANSCRIPT of an interview!!  Garbage!  The kata demonstrated was blurry and had several jet noises in the background.  Do not waste your money!!",1344988800,5,587,4.462264150943396
