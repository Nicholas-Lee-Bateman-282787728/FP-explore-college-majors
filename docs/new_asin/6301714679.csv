The way the artists potray the characters is truly superb. My favourate scenes is between the Tiruddu & Santuzza. The song 'No no Tiruddu' is done so well. also the intermezzo. Thelast act my Domingo 'Mama.....""saying goodbye to her mother before the fight with Alfio ofcourse he dies at the end. The woman who shouts ""Somebody has killed Tiruddu"" in Italian is such a thrill & has become so familiar with many movie goers especially ""the God Father part 3"" saga. This is a great video to own. Obrastva & Domingo have never sounded so good. I also like Alfio's voice with his whip at the beginning of the film when he enters the market & everyone sorrounds him to listen. Buy this one U won't regret.",1052438400,5,829,4.3896103896103895

7814352,5,6301714679,"Agree with the 9/3/99 review except I like Zeffirelli better than Coppola and Domingo's wig was truly awful in this production.  His hair was perfect so why they made him wear a wig is a mystery and unfortunately I found it distracting throughout the film.  Otherwise, it is the very best available.  The music is devine, passionatly performed.  The wig can be forgiven.",995587200,7,370,4.825396825396825
