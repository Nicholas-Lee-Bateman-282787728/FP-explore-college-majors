8129760,5,B000GAKG1C,This book is from one of the best music schools in the world. It's a good place to start for the beginner guitarists.,1408579200,,117,4.130434782608695
8129761,4,B000GAKG1C,This is a very useful DVD that will allow you to proceed with the Volume 1 book without a teacher. Larry Baione explains everything in a simple way giving also some very useful advises how to proceed with the Book,1405296000,,213,4.35
8129762,5,B000GAKG1C,"This dvd has been great for learning to read sheet music and playing the guitar. I practice as time allows, and review previous lessons as needed. I want to learn the guitar, but do not have the time to practice daily with a full time job and a family. With this dvd and the Vol. 1 lesson book, it gives me the ability to learn as I have time, and review. The dvd runs fine on my two windows laptops.",1400371200,,400,4.0125
8129763,1,B000GAKG1C,I'm very disappointed.  This DVD was produced in 2005 and never updated to work with modern operating systems.  Hal Leonard really needs to update the format of this DVD or stop selling it.,1393977600,,189,4.696969696969697
8129764,2,B000GAKG1C,"I like the Modern Method for Guitar book and I have been using it to help learn guitar and music theory. I wanted this DVD to help me with video lessons linked to the book. I discovered that it will not work on Mac computers with Lion OS or later. That is a problem and a disappointment. Amazon was great to allow me to return the item, but I am disappointed that I cannot supplement my work with the book. I hope that they will update their video materials.",1392595200,2,458,4.157303370786517
