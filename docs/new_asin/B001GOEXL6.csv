The production quality of many of these Chinese-language martial arts DVDs is not even half that of Western DVDs such as those that Gaiam produces, besides overall camera quality has vastly improved since the 1990s and early naughties, as you can see in DVDs like this one.

That said, I really like the exercises in this DVD.  They are a qigong set, meant to promote the healthy and free flow of chi throughout the body.  None of the exercises require laying on the ground, but there is quite a lot of movement of the joints.  The man who presents them is supposedly eighty years old, but he moves with more fluidity and grace than many 40-year-olds doand his hair is still fully black, a fact he attributes to the ""running fingers through the hair"" technique that he shows.  His face bespeaks his years, but it is a pleasant one.  One of the reasons why I like this DVD so much is that it feels like spending a day in the park with an adopted Chinese grandfather who wants very, very much to pass on his family's secret health-preserving qigong to you.  The exercises have names of typically evocative Chinese type like ""Dragon Looks Out Over the Sea"".

If you want a very vigorous, sweat-provoking, or muscle-building work-out, then look to another DVD, but if you want a set of exercises that will help you to loosen your joints and practice looseness and swinginess throughout the body, then this one is great.  I think the exercises can be easily adapted to give a more vigorous workout if desired.  For example, when he swings his arms from side to side, instead of just shifting your weight from one foot to the other, you could swing your arms up from a right bow stance, swing them down through a wide horse stance, and swing them up the other side through a left bow stance.

The DVD concludes with a short section of Yang Yong doing a wall push-up and other feats that are quite amazing considering his advanced age, testifying to the effectuality of the Red Sand Palm program.

This DVD was the first in the GZBeauty line that I bought and it got me hooked.  I'm a somewhat isolated suburban housewife who happens to like Kung Fu.  When I pop one of these DVDs in, it feels like I've made the journey to China to study with the very best masters of these artsexcept that the subtitles make them much easier to understand than they would be in real life.",1489536000,,2499,4.497787610619469
