4166274,2,B003Q7B742,This was by far one of the best films of last year & I only give it 2 stars because it's the edited version of the movie. Hopefully Nickelodeon will realize this error & release the directors cut somewhere down the road. So for now we'll have to settle for this. Despite the 8 or 9 minutes cut outta the movie it's still a great view & a most terrific finale to the TMNT 2k animated series. Another serious set back too is why the heck are there no special features on this disc?! A documentary on the making of this flick or a feature about the TMNT universe or history would've been a real treat for fans. What a shame.,1277078400,9,621,4.140495867768595
4166275,1,B003Q7B742,"I can't begin to explain how much it truly pains me to give this gem of a movie one star. Being a huge fan of the Ninja Turtles, I fell in love with this movie when I saw it on TV (even though it was reduced to 70 minutes, like it's evidently being released here). And once I saw the entire version (79 minutes) I fell in love with it even more.

To think that Nickelodeon is going to release this movie at it's edited length is disgusting. You may think I'm over-reacting, but seriously... what is the point of not issuing the full movie? This is DVD people, there are no time constraints for commercials. And trust me, that 9 mintues they cut goes a long way in humor, action, plot explanations and even character depth (i.e. Shredder).

Also, look at the cover art. As you can tell by other reviews, the coolest thing about this movie is that it stars the famous Turtles from the 1987 animated series (voiced by sound-alikes who do a great job)... and they're no where to be seen on the cover!

Hopefully Nickelodeon ammends these foolish mistakes. I will gladly delete this review if they come to their senses before the release date.",1277078400,81,1138,4.40952380952381
4166276,2,B003Q7B742,"I have been a fan of the TMNT since the 1980's era cartoon, and am now a huge fan of the comic book as well, and in all my years on this Earth (30 to be exact!) I have never seen a compilation quite like this. Mind you I have not yet seen the movie in it's entirety but I have seen the online trailers, at which point I was totally psyched. Sadley though, it turned out that I had seen the trailers about three months to late as this is a TV movie and was no longer airing, so now I'll get a second chance to see it. But who can beat this, all three turtles universes coming together in one movie: the Mirage comic books, the 1980's cartoon and the 2003 cartoon (Four universes if you count the live action movies. Rahzar and Tokka anyone?). I guess there's only one thing left to say about this one: Cowabunga!!!
(Update-8/15/10) Okay, I've just seen the unedited version of the movie on the 4kidsTV website so now I can do a proper review. I repeat my word from above reguarding the movie itself, I felt like I'd gone back in time to my childhood when I saw the 1987 turtles in a new production for the first time in twenty three years (although now that I'm grown up I see that they were kind of annoying too), and as for the comic book turtles: grim, gritty, ""less talk, more action"", and with darkly toned voices to match, OH YES!! (Seeing them in each other's universes was interesting too, although also a bit weird). But reguarding the DVD release I have a different word: lame (pointing my thumb down). If Nickelodeon hasen't fixed this release by now then it's not even worth the above price reduction. I was hoping they would at least put the deleted scenes on as a bonus feature but they can't even do that. Listen up Nick because I know you read these things sometimes. You've always been my favorite children's network but have lost a lot of my respect since the start of the 2000's with these lesser quality shows that you're airing now (Spongebob and Penguins are the only ones that are currently worth watching), and even more so with the cancelation of Nick Rewind, (we can't finish collecting Pete & Pete and Amazon hasn't been helping to much with the current Nick Rewind), but now I'm really peeved. I've even reduced my above star rating from four to two. We all appreciate the fact that you want to release this movie to us, but it diserves a lot more respect, esspecially being the best turtles movie so far. So either release this movie properly (ie the full version, wide screen format, and with the real cover) or I'll disown you all together and give you a ninja drop kick you won't soon forget. Woah, I'm starting to sound like the 2003 and comic book versions of Raph. Man, that's cool.",1276992000,5,2716,4.369565217391305
4166277,5,B003Q7B742,"This was movie was hilarious. I saw it during Comic Con of 2009 during the Ninja Turtles Shell-ebration for their 25 year anniversary. I managed to get tickets to the Turtles Forever movie and it was worth running 7 blocks and 4 flights of stairs to get there on time. It was funny, it was witty, it both teased itself as well as gave us fans exactly what we love about the turtles. Homage was paid to the old 80's toon turtles, the more recent 2k3 toon turtles, even the live action movies as well as the original comics were paid respect in this movie.

At the time, 4Kids Entertainment still held the rights and so they wanted to end everything with a bang, and they succeeded. They did everything right in this movie. I will admit, that at first, when it first began, my head tilted to the side because I didn't know what to think; but as realization hit and then the brilliance unfolded, I laughed and quickly fell in love with the entire movie. The group of friends I had gone with to the Con stayed up with me till well past 3 in the morning and we were still talking about it.

Humor, clever plot, and just honest in your face turtle moments that span the last 25 years, it was brilliant. Absolutely brilliantly done with enough wit to entertain adults, humor for the children, and turtle fans of all ages and eras will embrace and treasure.

Spoilers:
The Movie is spoof, an Alternate Universe of sorts where the 2k3 toon turtles run into their counterparts from the 80's toon. While they try and figure out how to send them back to their world, they discover that the 2k3 Shredder has returned from his exile and has accidently fallen through the time warp into the 80's toon and quickly takes control - even while the 80's toon Shredder and Krang try valiantly (and fail spectacularly) to become part of his evil plans. 2k3 Shredder realizes to rid himself of the turtles, he has to kill the ORIGINAL turtles in their original universe - and in a fight for survival, the turtles from both universes unite to save both themselves and other worlds.

But seriously folks, as dumb as that might sound, it was so brilliantly executed, its well worth it! :D

I still think this is a great find and a great DVD. I only have one complaint and it was the way that the 80's Turtles were portrayed. They weren't always that funny. They too had a serious side and I think the first 2 seasons proved that. Of course, as time went on, they had to water down the characters for Saturday mornings but other than that the story was great. The bonus for me was when the 80's Turtles and the Turtles from the 2000's went back to 1984 and met the orginal turtles which were way more ruthless and had a hard edge to their personal and attitude. Of course I am talking about the Mirage days in which that was when I followed the Turtles religiously. Anyway, no doubt, get this DVD!!

I did a little digging with HandBrake on my family's computer tonight and, as it turns out, the uncut version IS on the DVD, just not playable. Here's what you need to do:

1. Load the DVD into Handbrake.

2. Look for Title 11 (length: 1:22:59)

3. (optional) If you want to rip the movie so you can watch it whenever & wherever you want, go right ahead; remember, it's only illegal if you plan on selling it afterward.

Update: OK, seems I was mistaken. What I initially believed to be the uncut version turned out to be nothing more than poorly-edited horse hockey; apparently, Nickelodeon's network executives, like so many others in the business of network television, aren't listening to what the viewers & paying customers WANT because they all have their heads up their (CENSORED) to their shoulders.

The movie's premise is excellent, the plot excellent, they used a lot of the necessary
characters from the three universes, the action was strong, and they combined the universes
in a great way! I loved it, but with the three problems mentioned above, it gets
a B or three-and-a-half stars in my book!

My friend apparently has exceptionally low standards.

I did not realize it was the finale of the newer Turtles show from 2003, which I didn't find nearly as charming or entertaining as the one I grew up with. It has the flat, over-saturated, copycat feel of Jackie Chan Adventures. I found it less entertaining to see the original turtles treated like bumbling wannabes by generic, steroidal turtles, instead of schooling the new kids.

4166339,5,B003Q7B742,"A lot of the cartoons I loved as a kid haven't aged well. I suppose they figured that the story didn't necessarily have to make sense as long as it was fun. Eight-year-old me was entertained so it's hard to argue with the thinking.

Still, shows like Batman the Animated Series elevated the quality of a lot of kids shows. Sure there will always be some garbage but overall I think the modern takes on 80s properties are huge improvements.

This movie plays with that. My exposure to the modern TMNT cartoon is pretty limited but it looks pretty impressive. It also seems to take itself VERY seriously for a show about giant talking humanoid turtles. The old TMNT embraced its goofiness. They play off each other perfectly.

It's like the Odd Couple but with more mutants and throwing stars.",1346976000,,791,4.635714285714286
4166340,4,B003Q7B742,"For the 25th anniversary, we got new TMNT meeting the 80s TMNT (along with Shredder, April, Master Splinter, Bebop, Rocksteady, and Krang). The plot is simple - after a dimensional portal accident, the 1987 turtles get transported to the 2003 incarnation. Meanwhile, the technodrome also got transported and the 1987 Shredder awakens the Utrom known as Ch'rell(aka the 2003 Shredder). Soon Karai (Ch'rell's daughter) arrives and helps her father get a new body. The New Shredder amps up the technodrome and plans on destroying all of the turtles' universes!

The problem I have with Nickelodeon's US DVD release, is that it is the TV cut version and not the uncut version with the missing 8 minutes.

I actually like the movie, despite the fact that none of the 1987's original voice actors returned. Some fans complain about the old turtles being dumb down, but I never saw that way. It was nice to see the turtle blimp and the party wagon have a cameo.",1345766400,,954,4.810975609756097
4166341,5,B003Q7B742,"as a long time TMNT fan this movie is indeed the treat, sure it has a few flaws (such as the 80's turtles being downplayed abit more than they should be.) but for a crossover between the two biggest tv shows so far and the original comic turtles it definitely gets the job done and is worth the buy if your a fan of the show.",1338681600,,325,3.9393939393939394
4166342,3,B003Q7B742,"Looking at the cover, I can understand a lot of people not even realizing that this is not just a new ninja turtles movie relating to the newer forms of TMNT. What it actually is, is a cross between the 1987 Ninja Turtles, or the original cartoon series, crossing dimensions and meeting the newer TMNT. Basically the plot is that the 1987 Turtles have somehow ended up coming through into an alternate reality where they meet up with the newer TMNT clan. The 1987 Shredder and Krang have also come through to the new dimension and found out there is an alternate Shredder, who Krang and 1987 series Shredder bring back from the dead pretty much. It's up to the EIGHT turtles to stop the Shredders and a new super Technodrome from eliminating the Ninja Turtles from existence in all alternate realities. By the end, there is 12 Turtles, 3 shredders, and an interesting insert of a lot of the Ninja Turtle adaptions over the past 20 years or so. Fans of the new and old can now come together and see both their favorites from the 2 cartoon series, and enjoy a small and interesting enough movie.

My only beef with the movie is; The 1987 TMNT where never really that annoying as they seem in this one. Sure, they said these sorts of things now and then, but they looked like a whacky off the wall bunch of toon's, which wasn't at all what dominated the original 1987 series. But, what can ya do about it? It is what it is now. And it's ok if it sounds like it would interest you... it's not super brilliant or something you will kick yourself for never seeing, but it's a decent converge of the TMNT timelines.",1334793600,,1608,4.414141414141414

4166344,5,B003Q7B742,"As a huge fan of the original TMNT series and being from the UK I found the only way to get hold of the DVD box sets was to import them from the US, where they have been released steadily since 2004 with the latest release, Season 8, released in 2009.  As I was regularly checking for new TMNT releases I noticed this release, Turtles Forever, which is a cross-over of sorts between the original 1980's animated series and the later 2000's series which I was also a fan of.

I was put off ordering at that time due to some of the reviews posted here that complained of a shortened running time (despite there being no time limitations on DVD releases), 4:3 letterbox format (despite the film being originally made in 16:9 widescreen) and a generic cover featuring just the 2000's animated Turtles (despite the existence of a promotional poster made specifically for this film depicting both sets of Turtles). Many complained that Nickelodeon, having only recently obtained the TMNT licence, had short-changed long-term fans and should've put much more effort into their first TMNT release, especially given that it seems they've gone out of their way to make this package as poor as possible.

I'm glad I waited, because it seems Nickelodeon has listened, in a fashion, with the region 2 release of Turtles Forever which was out last week in the UK. All the issues noted above have been rectified, with the cover (featuring the promotional poster) boasting of the ""widescreen feature length animated feature"" (read 16:9 and full 80 minutes intact).  Other criticisms such as lack of DVD extras still stand, however, with the entire feature being less than the size of a single-layer DVD.

As for the feature itself, I enjoyed every minute of it despite the obvious voice cast changes and the rough treatment of the 1980's TMNT as over-the-top, pizza-obsessed, one-dimensional buffoons that bordered on self-parody for much of the film.  It was also good to see many of the original characters again, such as Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady, even if they didn't behave as they did in the original series. In short, fans of the 1980's series or the TMNT in general will love this film, especially as it is presented in the region 2 release.  The chances are Nickelodeon will not issue a new US release so if you haven't picked it up yet or you really want to see it as it was intended, I wholeheartedly recommend the UK release which is why I give Turtles Forever 5 stars.",1303862400,14,2466,4.734265734265734
4166345,4,B003Q7B742,The story was classic and the characters took me back to when I used to watch this show as a kid.  It brought up a lot of great memories and I would recommend seeing it if you are a kid at heart who just wants to watch ninja turtles and not judge the quality of its script.,1294704000,,273,3.789473684210526
4166346,5,B003Q7B742,"There's all sorts of reviews freaking out about a minus 9 minutes of footage and stuff about the format of the DVD. I had no problems with format whatsoever, and I'm very happy that I ignored reviews and bought the DVD anyway. I only caught the last 15 minutes of it on TV the other day, and I couldn't find it on again so I bought it.

The movie itself is fantastic. I grew up a hardcore Turtle fan, and while I tried to get into the newest series a few years back, I never really could. The original turtles are  bit bumbling and silly, which I love. I laughed, A LOT. And I love Krang! It was so great to see him again.

The one minor complaint I had with the film was the 1987 Leonardo. He was more silly than he ever was then. The others could get pretty wacky, but Leo always tried to reel them in. But in the movie, he wasn't very much of a leader. But otherwise - it was soooo awesome.",1292112000,,893,4.00561797752809

4166354,1,B003Q7B742,"The Movie itself is great. Here we find the 1980's Turtles accidentally transported to the Universe of the 2003  Turtles. The story really takes off when the Utrom Shredder discovers the multiverse and attempts to destroy all turtles everywhere (resulting in another crossover). I think the movie was done very well. I'm not familiar with the '03 turtles, but the original turtles and villians,were done very well (maybe slightly more goofy than normal)and voiced by sound-alikes of the originals who did a great job. Lots of memorable lines and just plain well put together.. Watching Shredder chasing after his command chair while it was being hauled away was just one of many hilarious scenes. This movie is a huge treat for turtle fans everywhere....or at least it was meant to be.

So far, the releases of the seasons of the 80's turtles have been fabulous. Unfortunately,
the rights were bought by Nickelodeon and the terrible release of this movie by them shows the grim future that we the fans have coming to us if things don't change. Heres 4 good reasons why:

1. This is a dvd release, not an aired release-no commercials, no time constraints-nothing inappropriate to censor. And I don't know much about disk storage space,but I have many movies well over the 79 minute mark with many other features, so I know that wasn't an issue. Yet Nickelodeon edited parts of the movie out of this release. No reason to do that whatsoever.

2. This film was created in widescreen, yet they put this into letterbox full screen, you miss out on some of the picture--I didn't know what letterbox was when i read about it here on other reviews (I know now) its really noticeable in a bad way

3. If you were to look at the cover of this dvd in a store or here on Amazon and knew nothing about the film, you would have no idea this was a crossover,you would just think ""oh a new 03' turtles movie"" or ""oh a few episodes of the turtles no big deal"" Its a nice cover, for a '03 turtles release, but for this its horrible-the artwork made by the fans blows this away. Truthfully, I almost missed out on this after this if it wasn't for an article I read on wilkipedia about Krang, i wouldn't ever knew this great gem existed.

4. This release is supposed to be part of the 25th Anniversary celebration of the turtles. There is NOTHING whatsoever if the way of bonus features, special features, interviews, a look back at turtle history. Nothing!! Just the movie some credits and previews that have nothing to do with the turtles.

I would have given this movie 5+ stars, but it was so poorly released I can't justify it.
Originally I was going to pass on this terrible release after reading the reviews of others, but I really wanted to see it, so (begrudgingly) I bought it. I actually tried for a good 2 weeks to contact Nickelodeon to inquire if there will be a re-release of this movie as a directors' cut or some nicer alternate release in the future. After leaving at least 8 unanswered voice mails and talking to a few operators and customer service reps, I truly believe that Nickelodeon doesn't care about the fans or the franchise they bought(Don't believe me? call them). They are out to make a quick $ and thats it,nothing else. As a fan, the best I can hope for at this time is that they don't butcher the remaining seasons (and that they actually release them) of the turtles too badly, and that for some reason they sell the license to a company that cares about the fans. Thankfully, at my age turtles is the only show I can foresee myself buying that Nickelodeon would be likely releasing.",1289692800,11,3598,4.560371517027864
4166355,1,B003Q7B742,The reason I gave this one star is just for the utter lack of respect that was given to the ORIGINAL TMNT. They *created* this franchise. Yet this movie did nothing but make them out to be bumbling goofballs and idiots. Completely disrespectful and horrible. I cringed throughout the entire first half of this 'movie'.,1289606400,8,318,4.8

4166357,2,B003Q7B742,"The 1987 Turtles and the 2003 Turtles finally collide together in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles Forever.  Although when I heard about it I was excited for it seeing that they're going to be putting both versions together for the first time, though when watching it I have to say that it's good but there's one thing though that kind of bothers me.  Though with the `original' show that was done sure it was campy and all but the writing that was done seemed like that whole show wasn't serious and saying that there wasn't any seriousness at times in the show.  The show started in seriousness but not so much in the later episodes but with the 2003 show, it seemed like that they were able to tone up the seriousness for the whole serious just about.

Second thing that seems to bother me is that the original voice actors for the 1987 Turtles and other characters weren't able to be in this movie which is like a let down for anyone that grew up watching that show.  Though I have to say that people are complaining that this is not in widescreen, and I have to say that when I got a copy recently I put it in my PlayStation3, the movie was showed in widescreen with the black bars on top and bottom of the screen.  I'm not sure which version that they seem to have if it's really in full screen.  Other than a few of the problems that I have mentioned this is not bad, and this is coming from someone who hasn't seen the `extra footage', though I think most people tend to be too whiny and I don't get that at all.

4166359,3,B003Q7B742,"'ve never really been a huge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan. Sure, I've seen the original series and even owned a VHS tape or two, and yes, I've seen a dozen or so episodes of the newer show, and yes, I've seen all the movies. But I wasn't a fanatic. I watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because it was entertaining and passed the time, but I never crossed over into becoming obsessive, like when it came to the DCAU. If all the TMNT writing were like TMNT: Turtles Forever  though, I probably would have.

The story follows the 2k3 Turtles as they meet their 80's counterparts from another dimension. It turns out the 80's Shredder is attempting to take over the world. At some point, the 2k3 Shredder takes control of the 80's Shredder's operation and attempts to destroy all of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of all realities. (At this point we are treated to a shot of almost every incarnation of the Turtles, from the comics to the various TV shows and movies.) Then it's up to the 80's and 2k3 turtles to team up with the original Turtles from the comics to stop the 2k3 Shredder from wiping out all realities. There are a few plot holes, but you barely notice it because of all the fun you're having.

The movie commemorates the 25th anniversary of the franchise, and it is essentially a crossover between the old series, the newer one, and the comic book. What's most entertaining about this romp between varying realities is the way that it isn't above making fun of itself. At times it really seems to be poking a little bit too much fun at the original series, but towards the end the 2003 series gets it's due as well. Still, it's all in good fun, and probably won't bother fans of either series too much. My favorite jokes are when the 80's Turtles break the third wall and begin talking to the audience while the 2k3 characters question who they're talking to, and 80's Donatello's explanation for their absolutely ridiculous ""science"" they employed regularly during that show.

The animation is fantastic, brilliantly imitating the 80's style when needed, while making it still not look too out of place with the 2k3 style. The Mirage Comic version of the Turtles are animated splendidly, looking like a black and white comic book, complete with thick and thin lines and heavy black shading, looking completely unique, like nothing I've ever seen in animation before. It looks absolutely beautiful, and the animation is simply top notch.

Unfortunately, in Nick's first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles DVD release since their acquisition of the brand, they have put out a DVD that is pretty bare-boned. It's a horrible release, in fact. We could've used a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles documentary or retrospective, or at least a creators commentary. Instead, we get no extras to speak of. Oh, but it gets worse. This DVD contains the edited version of the movie. Not bad enough? It gets worse still. Turtles Forever is presented in a letterboxed format. That may have been acceptable in 2000, but this is 2010! Get with the program Nick! It's really disappointing. Still, I have the feeling if this DVD doesn't sell well it'll adversely affect any upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles DVDs from Nick.

All in all, TMNT: Turtles Forever is an enjoyable film for fans of the franchise or even those who have just had a casual interest in it. It's a great way to celebrate 25 years of TMNT. As for this specific DVD, the lack of special features makes his hard to recommend and that's a real shame. If you're a fan, then I suppose you should buy it if you want to ensure future Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles releases. If you're not a fan, but just casually interested, then you should definitely rent it. It's just too good to completely pass up.",1283904000,3,3761,4.682299546142208
4166360,5,B003Q7B742,"1 Full Screen Format Disc on DVD, released August 24, 2010

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles Forever"" is a short movie (73 minutes) where the turtles of today's Nickelodeon cartoon through multi-verse magic (think that episode of ""Family Guy"" with the multi-verse remote shuffle starring Brian & Stewie) meet the turtles of my generation's cartoon where April still wore a yellow jumpsuit, got saved every episode, Shredder made jokes, and who could forget Krang? This tale of new meets old is a gem that kids of today and yesterday will equally love up for the nostalgia and fun!

This movie is an amazing trip down memory lane for children who grew up with the original cartoon series. It has all the corny jokes, the breaks for pizza, the old animation, gadgets that don't make sense, and have so much fun commenting on the old days. Michaelangelo says ""This is the lamest vehicle in the history of lame vehicles!!"" when perched on top of the turtles' blimp while the other group uses the old school wagon. All the pointing out of the ridiculousness of our original cartoon is all done very affectionately overall because who are we kidding? It was silly! And we LOVED it. Today's turtles are very serious and today's Shredder is a terror! So much so that when the old Shredder and new Shredder meet, O.S. is so excited that he and Krang grab a bowl of popcorn and a front row seat to watch N.S. work whispering to each other, ""Oh, he's GOOD!""

Not only do the old turtles travel to the world of the new by mistake, then they ALL travel back to the old leaving the new turtles very confused asking, ""What are these people WEARING??"" The grand evil plot is to destroy all versions of turtles everywhere so all types of turtles have to work together to stop it. Insert cameo from black and white graphic novel style version of turtles that involve Raphael monologuing the fight by voiceover as it goes (""Why are you narrating your actions?"" one asks giving me the biggest laugh of the movie).

Again, if you have ever loved ANY version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, this movie is for you because you get to see a bit of all of them. If I had any complaints at all, it would be a longing for some sort of live action turtle segment spliced in since the three live action movies were also near and dear to my heart (""Ninja Rap"" by Vanilla Ice!!).

4166361,1,B003Q7B742,"Turtles Forever was a fantastic movie, with an amazing crossover storyline between the 1987 animated TMNT and the 2003 animated TMNT, plus others!...and the culmination of 25 years of comics, tv shows, and movies.  This movie, to most TMNT fans, was something very SPECIAL, and more of a Thank You by Mirage and 4kids than anything to their loyal fans for the Turtles 25th anniversary celebration. If it wasn't for their love of the franchise and their fans, this movie would never have been made in the first place, it is in fact a miracle it even exists...

That being said... BOYCOTT this Nickelodeon DVD Release people.  PLEASE read the below information before even considering this purchase.

1. The Nickelodeon released DVD contains a 70 minute shortened version of the film, which is in all actuality 79 minutes long.  The 9 minutes that are cut out contain the following: ***Spoiler Alert***
- The scene where we first see the Turtles in the '03 Turtle Van and the Purple Dragons chasing them.
- The scene where '87 Michelangelo says ""Thar she blows dude"".
- When '87 Shredder is giving '03 Shredder a ""tour"" of the Technodrome, '03 Shredder asks to see the trans-dimensional portal.
- When Karai enters the Technodrome and the alarm goes off, '87 Shredder says ""Not those blasted Turtles again!"".
- Most of Karai's introduction speech (how she was keeping vigil over '03 Shredder, claiming ownership of the Technodrome, etc.) was removed.
- When the Technodrome is being rebuilt, Krang and Shredder yelling at the '03 Foot Soldiers for ripping out their computer components.
- When the '03 Shredder is talking to the trans-dimensional computer in order to see the multiverse, the computer acknowledging him as Oroku Saki, Destroyer of Worlds, etc.
- The scene where '03 Raphael calls the '87 Turtles ""Clowns"".
- The scene where Casey and April are fending off the mutants and April ejecting from the Turtle Chopper.
- When riding in the '87 Turtle Van, the argument about the '03 Shredder being ""psycho-evil"" and the '87 Shredder being ""decaf"".
- The long explanation the '03 Turtles give the Mirage Turtles about what was going on.
- When '03 Shredder attempts to crush the '84 Turtles and destroy the multiverse, his momentary hesitance due to Karai explaining that his fate is linked to the Turtles is removed. The television version has him attempting to crush the Turtles nonstop until he's hit by the exploding throwing stars.
- In the Nickelodeon edit the live action homage to Eastman & Laird (Original creators of TMNT) is removed.

2.  Seems like a lot is being left out eh?  Well, there's more bad news.  The film itself was shot and animated in theatrical widescreen (16x9) aspect ratio.  The dvd, however is FULLSCREEN 4x3, and though people have confirmed it actually widescreen format, you WILL have black bars on top, bottom, and both sides of the movie.  You will essentially be watching a shrunken down movie inside a black box on your tv/screen.

3. The Cover art is TERRIBLE!  Turtles Forever is a CROSSOVER between the 87 cartoon TMNT, the 2003 cartoon TMNT, and even the original comic book TMNT, as well as camios of all of the TMNT movies.  The film was supposed to be an EVENT, a celebration for the 25th anniversary of the Turtles!  Instead, Nickeloden chose to put only the 2003 Turtles on the cover and make it look like just another generic dvd, nothing SPECIAL about it.  Please search google or wikipedia for the original Movie poster, and you will understand what I'm talking about.

My thought process here is that if we all ban together and BOYCOTT this release, maybe Nick will decide to release the REAL version of this amazing movie, the way it was intended to be seen.  Don't let Nickelodeon ruin the Turtles!!!

4166362,2,B003Q7B742,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, especially the original animated series, is dear to many a fan's heart. So much so, in fact, that someone at 4Kids Entertainment came up with a genius idea--why not have an epic crossover between the 80s Turtles and their modern animated counterparts?  Hence Turtles Forever, an approximately 75 minute movie featuring both the classic and modern characters meeting each other for the first time.  It's a fanboy's dream come true, right?

In some ways, yes.  Not only do the original 80s cartoon Turtles show up in the modern 2003 cartoon's timeline, but they're drawn in the exact same soft, pudgy, child friendly demeanor as they were so many years ago.  In fact, their appearance juxtapozed with the taller, more angular and gritty designs of their modern brethren is good for a few laughs in and of itself.  But it doesn't stop there.  The original Shredder, Krang, Splinter, and April O'Neil show up, along with Rocksteady and Beebop, and their personalities all remain faithfully intact (well, mostly).

And the humor, when it works, it works.  The modern Turtles are constantly bewildered by their seemingly one-track minded brothers--the 80s Turtles walk around the city in broad daylight without a care to the dumbfounded people about them, they think about nothing but eating pizza, and Raphael constantly breaks the fourth wall, all to the consternation of the remaining cast.  The 2003 Shredder sees his classic counterpart as a bungling idiot and Rocksteady and Beebop quickly find themselves replaced by more effective henchman.  Again, it's all very amusing.

But all is not perfect in this crossover.  As the movie progresses, it's clear the writers don't hold the original turtles in much esteem and constantly render them as little more than goofy foils to their more competent and serious counterparts.  Leonardo rarely leads, Raphael wisecracks at completely inappropriate times, and they all have the attention span of a three-year-old.  Granted, the original series was always a bit more lighthearted than later incarnations, but the Turtles were rarely ever this silly or one-dimensional.  Classic episodes have Leonardo questioning his role as leader, Michaelangelo dwelling on whether he contributes anything to the team, and Raphael saddened over the departure of a potential soulmate.  But none of that depth is revealed here.  The 80s Turtles were just party-hardying clowns designed for five-year-olds, right?

Making matters worse, the DVD release omits several minutes of footage seen in other formats, and is stricly presented in standard TV (4:3) format.  No anamorphic widescreen here.  And the extras?  Surely there's at least a few classic episodes included from the original series, right?  Nope, there's nothing but the chapter select.

This movie is bound to split the fan base.  Some will enjoy the movie for what it is despite its inaccurate depictions of the classic Turtles and lack of features because, in the end, it still manages to entertain.  But others, especially those who grew up with the original cartoon, will find the shortcomings in this movie too egregious to forgive.",1283299200,10,3169,5.238095238095238
4166363,5,B003Q7B742,i had been waiting to see this and was not dissapointed. i love that the utrom shredder put 1987 shredder in his place and the apperances of the 87 turtles and how the interact with the 03 turtles is funny  and was delighted to see the mirage turtles in on it too they had some good one liners,1283299200,,293,4.051724137931035
4166364,3,B003Q7B742,"I was half expecting that this movie would never see a DVD release at all. So in a way, to be getting anything is nice. But Nickelodeon could have done so much more. This is the movie that was made to mark the 25th anniversary of the Turtles. It deserves more pomp than this.

On the plus side, it's not full screen as indicated on the box. As stated in other reviews, it is in wide screen, showing everything that was in the wide screen version that was on TV. But even this is bittersweet since it's not anamorphic. To be fair, it still looks pretty good when using the zoom function on my television. But in this day in age where widescreen televisions are becoming more common than not, no anamorphic widescreen on a DVD is just unexceptable.

The DVD cover I'm not quite so worried about. Sure it's generic, but I usually don't worry too much about covers. You can always photoshop your own using the easily found Turtles Forever poster on the net. I say I ""usually"" don't worry about covers, but I'm going to have to make an exception here. As I already mentioned, this is the 25th anniversary celebration movie. As such, it deserves to have all the stops pulled out. Browsing the video store, the cover is going to be the first impression many people have of this. And the first impression this cover gives is only of the '03 characters. Sure the '84 turtles are on the back, but it's the front that gives the first impression, and this is just lacking.

There are also no extras. This I find baffling. Not to sound like a broken record, but this is the 25th anniversary movie. A DVD release of something like this deserves to have extras. Something, anything! Throw in some old interviews. Throw in some old toy commercials. Throw in a behind the scenes. Anything that would let us know that Nickelodeon at least acknowledges what a big release they've been handed.

However, these three nitpicks pale in comparison to the main thing I have against this release. Again, as stated in other reviews, this is the TV edit. There is no reason for this. With no extra's to be found, there is certainly more room on the DVD than 73 minutes for a TV edit.

It's sad that this is how Nickelodeon decides to treat the long time fans of the Turtles. If this is how they start out their ownership of the TMNT franchise, I'm fearful of what we have to look forward to in the future.

So why the three stars (an actually decent rating)? Well, as I said at the beginning, I was half expecting we wouldn't get anything at all as far as a DVD release. The TV edit is still pretty good, even if it is incomplete. It is in widescreen, even if it isn't anamorphic. So I guess it will do for now. Here's hoping they decide to bilk even more money out of us by releasing the full version with extras and on Blu-ray some time in the future.",1283126400,,2825,4.371428571428571
4166365,1,B003Q7B742,One big joke!! Those words describe this dvd.  As a fan of the original turtles cartoon series I've got to say that the writers butchered this storyline.  They failed to capture the personality of the 80's turtles and took every second of the show to ridicule them one by one.  After 30 minutes I just could not watch anymore.  Don't waste time with this piece of garbage.,1283126400,9,372,4.507462686567164

Sure the 80's turtles were made to be sillier than they should've but it was still fun and I've watched it 3 times on TV so I'm looking forward to purchasing the DVD.  Now here's the thing, there're plenty of reviews here from people complaining the DVD is only 70 min long and the edited version.
Don't even know if I watched the unedited or not.  If it wasn't on TV, then no.  Either way, here's the thing.  Amazon lists the DVD at 90 min.  So maybe since those reviews were done before the DVD actually came out several grains of salt should be taken because unless Amazon is just plain lying, the DVD is definitely NOT 70 min long.",1282867200,,689,4.3023255813953485
4166368,3,B003Q7B742,"Turtles Forever was a movie that served as the series finally of the 2003 TMNT animated series.  It's a great movie that features the TMNT Multiverse of characters, with a team up that includes the 1987 Turtles as well as cameos from a great many characters.

This movie is great fun, and deserves a full five stars just for the movie itself.  It managed to capture lightning in a bottle and made me feel like a kid again while I watched it.  Whenever another old character appears, it gets more and more fun.  The writers managed to capture the quirky late 80s turtles very well.  The comedy in the movie is spot-on.

It's a shame that the original voices couldn't all return for this adventure, as that would have made a near perfect turtle adventure even better.

I read the reviews of the DVD here, but decided to opt-in for a DVD anyway.  I have it on right now, on my widescreen TV.  Here's what I can report:

1)  This version of the film is 72 min 35 seconds long, so the box rounds that up to 73 minutes.
2)  While packaging says ""Full Screen Format"" it is in fact Widescreen.  The biggest issue is that this disc was created as if it was still 1999 and DVDs were brand new.  The Widescreen video is not anamorphic, so it does not adjust itself to fill the screen.  It looks as though it may have been encoded with the black bars at the top and bottom of the video, so that it would fit an old school tv.

I am not aware of what the difference is between the television version and the uncut version of the movie, so I can't report on which version this disc ultimately holds.

I feel that this movie deserves better.  A Blu-ray edition with special features going behind the scenes on the making of this movie, as well as a round-table with the writers, would be terrific!",1282694400,10,1782,4.313253012048193

I knew that they were going to make fun of the old toon, which was OK because it made fun of itself.  Instead, the writers seemed to only want to show how awesome the new versions are and how awful, incompetent, annoying, etc. the old ones were.  In doing so they ignored the personality differences of the old turtles (it was like having 5 Michaelangelos at a time) and had a ton of plot holes and inconsistencies with what happened in the old cartoon.  If the old turtles had been that annoying, I would never have become a fan. I had to stop watching after 30 minutes, which I never do. If you hated the old cartoon and love the new, then this is for you.  Otherwise, don't bother!",1282608000,8,911,4.11864406779661

The characterization is awesome, the plot is engaging and quick moving, the inside jokes for the fans are top-notch, among so many other things. I think this movie was a love note to the fans, and the fondest farewell from Mirage when they handed the torch to Nickelodeon.

Even if you don't consider yourself a fan of the Ninja Turtles - you just might after watching this!

I'm hearing mixed messages about whether this upcoming release will be the uncut version or the edited version they showed on television.
My opinion is this film is so awesome that it doesn't matter to me which version is released. I'm showing my love of the fabulous foursome by buying whatever version comes out! If you've never seen it - I recommend seeing this no matter what version it is. This movie was so great that it still works well even with some of it edited out.

I have to take a moment to mention all of the 1 star reviews from people who haven't even seen the movie. It really just blows my mind.

Giving a movie a 1 star rating based on the cover art is flat-out asinine.

Last of all, giving a moving a 1 star rating will not do anything to help the Ninja Turtles franchise because a lot of people will skip this incredible work after they see the low ratings. I know you guys are trying to convey a message, but what I see you doing is helping to put the Ninja Turtles in a grave before Nickelodeon even gets a chance to show fans (and future fans) what they can do.",1281916800,3,1691,4.30503144654088

Since the news broke about Nickelodeon's acquisition of the TMNT IP, fans have been waiting patiently, but also very nervously, to see how Nick was going to handle the property.  Like the others have said, this is NOT a good way for them to kick things off with the Turtles.  The sample DVD cover is an absolutely horrible representation of the movie.  They really need to use the promo poster that has been used to promote it since the show was announced to be aired.  Seriously, Nickelodeon/Viacom, please scrap the sample cover shown here and use the proper one.

Also, please include the additional 9 minutes of footage.  For Pete's sake, it's on DVD.  Why on Earth would you leave that off?  Who is/was in charge of producing this release?  Could they not have done 5 minutes of internet research to have made better decisions when putting this together?  I find this lack of competence appalling...

Again, to whom it may concern at Nickelodeon... please correct these mistakes and make it right before the release of this DVD.

SPOLIERS BELOW!!!

The plot is simple, the Turtles from the 80's series end up in the highly dark and kiss ass version of the Turtles we all now love, they are captured by the Red Dragons and are saved by the Turtles of the 90's afterwards, it is found that the 90's or well known as the Utrom Shredder and Karai finds the Tecnodrom and revamp it with more Utrom tech with the Human Shredder, Krang, Rocksteady and Bebop, and of course the blow em up Foot Soldiers in for more comedy than anything else.

The Utrom Shredder find the dimension portal in the Technodrom and finds out there are not only two sets of Turtles but 1000's of sets, and he sets out to destroy them all by going back to the first set that was ever born are old black and white friends that was perfect way back when and wipe them out at the cost of the universe!... what will happen?

4166395,1,B003Q7B742,"This is a horrible excuse for a release of this film.
Why?
Reason 1. There are 9 minutes of the original film cut out of this version. This should be 79 minutes long. As you can see Nickelodeon is only selling the censored version with a running time of 70 minutes.

Reason 2. This film was animated and created in widescreen. As you can see from the description this release will cut off the right and left sides of the screen to make the picture 4:3 full screen.

Reason 3. The DVD cover is a horrific example of poor design and disregard for the actual product. This film has three different sets of turtles and only one set is even on the cover. A wonderful Comic-Con poster was created for this film and can be seen by searching google or wikipedia. Why it wasn't used is anyones guess.

With this DVD release Nickelodeon needs to do the fans a favor and re-release this film on Blu-ray in an unedited true widescreen presentation. If that does not happen I suggest you buy the UK version from Amazon's UK site.",1279324800,82,1016,4.3936170212765955

If you're one of those people who CAN'T wait, or someone who would LIKE to see the un-edited cut, go to [...]!
They have the Turtles Forever Movie (Director's Cut!!!) and you can watch the entire movie! (No Charge)
For anyone who missed it when it played on tv, here's the basics.
The 80's turtles fall through an inter-demensional rip and land in the world of the Y2K turtles.  Not time travel, but another parellel universe.  After getting caught by the purple dragons (80's), the Y2K turtles bust them out and try to find a way to get them home.  Easier said than done, because Shredder and Krang (along with the tecno-drome) have fallen into the Y2K world as well.  After realizing there are 2 sets of turtles now, Shredder trys to find the villian that shares his name in this demension.  Using his transporter, Shredder bring back to earth.....
Yes, you gussed it, the u-trom Shredder that we saw exiled at the end of Y2K season 3. (And he has NO use for the Shredder that brought him back.)
Meanwhile, the Turtles (both groups) build a inter-demensional potal stick (I Know...Portal stick???) to get to the 80's demension to retrive their ""Tecno-drome equitment"", but before they can leave Hun and the foot break in to their home, grab master Splinter, and collapes the entire dojo.  The Turtles escape using the portal stick and land in 80'S Turtle land!  After a quick stop to save April, they pick up their Anti-Tecno-drome gear, and head back to the Y2K world.
I'm not saying anything more (that would be telling), but anyone who grew up with the 80's guys will appreciate this movie.  Caution: Many bad puns and mutagen ahead!!!

When they started coming out they all had horrid stock art that could be found on the official turtles website and assembled by an amateur at best. As time went on they started creating original artwork and the releases started getting better. 4Kids was finally releasing half season sets instead of out of order volumes containing only 4-5 episodes. I was happy.

Then the buy out happened. I expected no more releases and I honestly never thought ""Turtles Forever"" would see a DVD release. The fact it did is great news but it's also bittersweet. We're back to stock art covers and the release is edited down. The film has plot holes with those few minutes removed. Some of the people at 4Kids have been trying to get Nick's attention. They have sent them the movie poster to be used as a cover as well as the extended cut. They have yet to respond. This is just a big middle finger to the fans.

They probably don't care what a 22 year old turtles fan thinks but the main pull for this film are older fans. Kids now are too young to have seen the old toon or have read the comic.

I have never watched Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewers, but I feel they treated the 80s-90s show with a complete lack of respect that series and their characters were due. Since more or less during the entire film they treat their counterparts like clowns.

Let's start off with the voice acting, how much would've it cost Nickelodeon to pay for the original voice actors of the 80s show to appear in their respective roles? Or maybe hire some better people to pretend to be them, since the quality wasn't here.

When it comes to the writing, yes the original foot soldiers were easy to beat, but Shredder and Krang weren't always so easy to beat, or acted in the manner they did in this film. Shredder from the 80s seemed overly dramatic in both his body language and dialog. This threat of a giggle ray at the end? Seriously? Shredder's main focus was usually getting the Technodrom from X to the surface of New York City. This would be followed up by taking over the city, and then the world. Something this ""giggle-ray"" would've never accomplished. More than a few times he'd face off against all four turtles and win, so why is he suddenly a push over?

Let's talk turtles, voice acting bad. Treating them like all they cared about was pizza and saving April once again not so great. I'll admit, Mikey & Ralph were dead on, but Donatello did graduate from University in the series, so treating him like an idiot, not cool. Leonardo more than once had to pull the team together for a hard fight, and he never once was given the chance to show his stuff. All four of them know they have to be serious and on mission during a fight, and several times they went outside this know parameter.
