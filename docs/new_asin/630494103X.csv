Dr. Wheelo wants the World's strongest fighter's body so  he can put his evil brain in to take over the world.  He kidnaps Bulma and  Master Roshi (my favorite character) and forces them to tell him who is the  strongest.  When Goku arrives, he is put to the ultimate test of survival.  And to make matters worse, Dr. Wheelo has taken control of Piccolo!  Find  out if our heros save the day or loose their minds!",919641600,3,575,4.044642857142857

His partner is after Master Roshi to transplant Wheelo's brain into Roshi's body. The combination of the brightest mind and the strongest body will make taking the world easy. There's just one problem. Wheelo's information is outdated. Roshi has been surpassed and is no longer Earth's strongest warrior. Goku is. When Goku shows up the plan changes and a fierce battle begins.

This is a really cool movie. It's fun to see Roshi put the smack don on these android bad guys. This is one of my favorite DBZ movies. It's a must have for any DBZ fan.",1351555200,,700,4.645161290322581
939798,5,630494103X,"Here are the key elements you need to know about this dvd movie boxed set released by Pioneer:

Audio:
- Has the Ocean dub english voice cast. The Funimation english voice cast (Sean Schemmel,Chris Sabat,etc) is not on these movie dvds. When playing the movies, the Ocean dub plays with the original japanese music only. You can also play the movies in japanese language with japanese music. Subtitles are available in english/japanese. The audio quality is very clear. Punches, energy waves, crashes all sound very realistic and better than the Funimation dvd/bluray movie releases.

Video:
- Presented in its original 4:3 (Fullscreen) not cropped on the sides, but not remastered. Which means dust,particles,""burn marks"" are present. Colors are untouched and look similar to the Dragon box set release. Image quality looks great when upscaled on my ps3 on a 1080p hd screen.

- All 3 movies are uncut which means swear words and blood is present.

Menu and extras:
- Interactive menu (Dragon in the background calling you're wish), character notes, deleted tv scenes, scene access, etc.

Overall:
Excellent release by Pioneer even today. If you already own the recent DBZ movie packs or bluray releases by Funimation or if you are simply looking for the ocean dub, then i recommend this movie boxed set.",1350950400,4,1305,5.051162790697674
939799,5,630494103X,This movie is pretty good. It's all about the story and the action when it comes to this movie. I definitely like the fights that Goku is up against in this movie.,1350604800,,163,4.125
939800,3,630494103X,"I was reading you DBZ reviews (great by the way!) and had a question...

Pioneer is known for their editing of DBZ, and Funimation is known for showing it uncut!... I have the old Pioneer 1-3 movie Box Set and it says its ""UNCUT""... is it the same as the Funimation ""UNCUT"" movies 1-3?",1203811200,,285,4.277777777777778
939801,4,630494103X,"Took longer to arrive then my usual arrivals but came in perfect working condition, great shape, and played just as described. Transaction was smooth and easy and worked out great. Overall a very much satisfied customer.",1186358400,,220,5.138888888888889
939802,5,630494103X,"Dragonball Z, the way it was meant to be dubbed!

These movies mark the first time Dragonball Z was made uncut, and used the original Japanese BGM alongside the English dub. It was also the first time any Dragonball Z DVDs contained the original Japanese audio, with English subtitles.

The one thing any new fan of Dragonball Z will notice, however, is that the English dub on here DOES NOT use today's voice actors of Dragonball Z, but rather a select cast from the Canadian dubbing group, Ocean Studios. Now this doesn't take away from the enjoyment by any means, because these guys know how to REALLY act! The English dub on these movies is so ahead of it's time, and there's nothing amiss here. The English dub keeps a dead-on script to the Japanese script, and the actor's deliver it in full. The only real downside to this set, is it's video quality; being an early DVD, it didn't have the encoding or transfer technology that there is today, and it shows. But don't let that stop you from making your decision for these DVDs, as it doesn't take anything away from the enjoyment of these movies. But if your not going for the English dub, and just want the Japanese version with subtitles, DON'T GET THIS SET. Instead get the new ""First Strike"" boxset, as it contains EXCELLENT subtitles by Steve Simmons, the very famous translator of the series, which he did not translate the subtitles on these DVDs.

The only setback, would be the rarity, and price... Right now, it's alittle overpriced at amazon, I would suggest hunting around on ebay.",1172016000,7,1549,4.645985401459854

Bulma gets captured too.

What was pointless in this movie is this is suppost to be more like a teenage movie which it is except for one part were theirs this sing along sung by Gohan, that can hurt the DBZ image trying to be like Disney. The Japanese are WEIRD I MEAN COO COO!",1120089600,,668,4.099236641221374

My favorite out of the three is The Tree of Might which is about a bunch a of warriors go to earth and plant a seed that makes a huge tree that sucks the energy out of the earth and makes a fruit that makes you very strong.  But all in all they are all awesome because all the Dragonball series are my favorite animes of all time if you don't know then DB, DBZ, and DBGT.ANIME FOREVER!",1052524800,2,450,3.934065934065934
939864,5,630494103X,"I bought the boxed set of Tree of Might, Dead Zone, and World's Strongest. World's strongest was the best because it is the most cussing I have ever heard in english diolge for DBZ. Granted it only says ""damn"" and ""hell"" but still. It is so much cooler than the kiddy stuff they show on TV. When you hear it in english.........it is so tight. This singal DVD is rare so you might as well buy the boxed set like I did. The other movies don't cuss as much but, but they are still really good. Tree of might is good too.",1032825600,,517,4.078431372549019
939865,4,630494103X,"""The World's Strongest"" is probably the best of the Dragonball Z movies for several reasons. Most significantly, characters who are entirely comic relief or nonexistent in the later movies, such as Kame-Senin (""Master Roshi"") and Kuririn(""Kryllin""), get a chance to have some halfway decent action of their own. Moreover, the threat they face is considerably different from their standard ""super-buff martial artist from another world/dimension"", and while of course the problem will have to be solved by standard Dragonball Z [fighting], the solution will not be as easy as they first think, and the problem has some complications.",1015200000,,632,5.459183673469388

939868,5,630494103X,"Anyone wonder how the dub of DBZ would be if the show landed in better hands? Nows your chance. For one reason or another, Pioneer ended up with the rights to the first 3 DBZ movies (Instead of FUNimation), and the end results speak for themselves! This thing just screams quality! The dubbing is good, and very close to the original Japanesse script (FUNimation NEVER came close to being on the dot)! The music is left untouched, and you even get to hear the ORIGINAL theme song! After hearing this it's hard to think kind of the American theme songs and score.
Not to mention the DVD has better picture quality then the FUNimation releases! Folks, I don't know if buying enough of these means Pioneer will be able to dub more DBZ (Although it won't likely ever happen again), but it's nice to have a company know what they're doing for once! Get this DVD...and see dubbed DBZ the way it should have all along!",1008288000,,911,4.493975903614458
939869,5,630494103X,"This movie is a great movie. Probablly 7th best out of 13 Movies there are better ones out there.

The movie itself is very good but don't expect a surprise within the average plot. I don't want to sound too negative as this is a good movie and the fighting sequences are ten times better than the series so if its fighting you want, this is for you.",1002067200,,359,4.217391304347826

If u miss out on this you truely aren't a dbz fan. The animation in this is truely amazing and the dubbing is suberb. I gave it 4 stars which it earned. Now the story line is weak but if your like me i say screw story line show me hardcore battle sequences. By now every true dbz fan should know all dbz is about is fighting. I love this movie and suggest it for a dbz fan to add to there collection. You'd be a fool to miss out on this. Buy it or i'll send you to another dimension",998784000,,619,3.8818897637795278
939930,5,630494103X,"There is nothing more to say about this movie than.....BRILLIANT!  No matter what the situation is, Goku and company is there to stop it. After Master Roshi and Bulma were kidnapped by Dr. Wheelo (or how ever you spell  his name), Goku and friends did not delay to save them. This has to be the  best out of the 3 movies!  Oh and if you were to see anything...you have  to see the Jap.version. I think it's a lot better. You'll be amazed what  Japan gets away with like in the Frieza saga, Frieza gets away with some  curses oh and theres actually blood....thats right...BLOOD!  Oh well. So  as I was saying, this is the best one out of the 3 and don't forget about  the 4th one coming out!  Well...peace!",960508800,6,705,4.305343511450381
939931,4,630494103X,"For the previous dubs that FUNimation did (despite the recently dubbed episodes), this movie surely makes up for their poor dubbing, because people die now, they don't get blasted to the 'Next Dimension'.
I do like  this movie though, and the fact that the entire thing didn't go uncensored.  The title theme for the movie 'Head-cha-la' was really neat, and I liked  it muchly.
The fighting scenes, and the original North American seiyuu  also made this movie cool, with the great way it was dubbed, the newer  voices wouldn't have done as good as a job.
So, out of the three movies  I've seen so far, 'The Tree of Might' and 'Dead Zone', this is the best of  all three.  I can't wait until the next movie gets released.  The music was  good, the plot was awesome, and the fighting scenes were really cool, and  for those parents with kids under ten, I suggest you rent this first.  If  you don't mind what your kid sees, buy it, you will like it.",957657600,7,947,4.436046511627907

When Goku  (voiced by Peter Kelamis who is not that good as Goku, or at least not as  good as the first Goku, Ian Corlett) screams  ""KAAAIIIOOOO-KENNNNNNNNN"" you will literally feel chills down  your spinal chord.  The fight with Piccolo is one to remember (Dead Zone's  was too short).  The only movie that can beat this is possibly movie 13 or  the 10th Anniversery Special.

My point is that this was masterfully dubbed and produced (still has the japanese soundtrack) and you can even switch back and forth between japanese/english voice actors if you wish. Comparing those dubs will make you appreciate Peter Kelamis as Goku and never want to see Sean Schemmel's work.
