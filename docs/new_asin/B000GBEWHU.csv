8130491,1,B000GBEWHU,"It started out ok, about the first fifteen minutes, then it was all down hill from there.  One thing that gets me is that no matter if he has a gun or a sword in his hand, the first time someone pokes him in the nose he drops whatever he has and the vampire has him, whoever he is with rescues him in the nick of time.  (I find this true of most action features).",1338854400,,363,3.8266666666666667
8130492,1,B000GBEWHU,"...because that's just about what it's worth.

I don't think I've ever seen a *duller* vampire picture in my life. The acting was so stilted that the lead vampire wasn't so much undead as just dead boring, most of the rest of the characters looked as if they were reading their lines from cue cards, and the best I can say for the gore was that I wanted to ask the vamps to brush their fangs after eating.

This was just the first third of the movie. I stopped watching after that--I didn't even bother keeping it on for background noise.

But, hey, at least the case can be reused.",1278979200,,582,4.2727272727272725
8130493,1,B000GBEWHU,"Picked up and watched two movies last night, Blade of the Vampire, and David DeCoteau's The Frightening.  Any one familiar with David DeCoteau's movies knows how hilariously lame they are.  Well, Blade of the Vampire makes The Frightening look like it should be up for an academy award, no joke!  Believe EVERY word the other reviewers here have written, because it's all true.  I usually don't gripe about the money spent on a B movie bought out of the bargain bin, but this one wasn't even worth a dime! You've been warned.",1264723200,,525,4.673913043478261
8130494,1,B000GBEWHU,"It's like the worst Spaghetti Western evey made (only without the cool cowboy boots and spurs) and I don't even think its foreign (at least then it would have an excuse for the poor dialogue). I think the director found some plastic fangs and said, ""hey, I got an idea!""

The acting SUCKS big time (which is good in a way, cause the vamps don't - at least not very well). The highlight of the film for me was seeing the ""Capitol Records"" tower in one of the ""scenic shots."" The vamps all run around in the day so you can't even hope for some spooky ambiance.

Oh and the special effects when the vamps vamp-out and bite?  Well THEY bite! A 5 yr old with an etch-a-sketch could come up with better effects! When the ""scary"" stuff comes - they hand the camera to someone with palsey and the shaking gives them the awesome FX they wanted for this total waste of film!

Take a pass, pop some corn and watch reruns of Perry Mason instead!",1159401600,,933,4.254237288135593
8130495,1,B000GBEWHU,"I wasn't expecting anything and I got less.  If this movie cost more the 29.95 to make I would be amazed.  The special effects were umm, very unspecial.  The vampire effects were laughable.  It was as if this was supposed to be a soft core porn vampire movie without the porn, or blood, or whatever. I can not say enough to convince anyone to stay away from this horrid piece of well, whatever you want to add.

I look for something good in every movie.  I can usually find something.  Well, I couldn't in this movie.  Unless you want to say that the redhead that they got to play in the movie was kind of cute.  When I have to reach that distance just to come up with something nice, well, take it from there.

I have watched over 1000 horror movies in my life.  I started in the early 80s and have never stopped.  If any of you remember Dungeonmaster, well, this was worse.  Dungeonmaster was the only movie I have ever walked out of.

Anyway, back to the don't buy, don't rent, send a strong message to the people that think they can slap vampire on something and call if a movie.  DONT DO IT.  If I could give this movie 0 stars and burn all the copies I would do it.",1157846400,3,1171,4.160714285714286
