1249220,4,B0000214FG,"Another movie Id give 3.5 stars to. Chester Morris stars in this 1930 version of Roland West's the Bat, called the Bat Whispers where he plays Detective Anderson out to stop the Bat from stealing a fortune in a house. Fun classic, although dated is still very enjoyable. It has a few great creepy movies and some really brilliant cinematography. Id recommend this movie to those who like classic haunted house mystery movies. Great twists and turns throughout as well as some amazing for its time cinematography. Chester Morris was a brilliant actor and this is one of his best films. Good to watch on a rainy or gray day or at night with some candles to add to the ambiance :) The DVD has 2 versions of the movie, the one to watch is the longer version that is letterboxed..recommended to those that like these early mystery/horror types..",1236384000,3,840,4.644295302013423
1249221,4,B0000214FG,"THE BAT WHISPERS is Roland West's 1930 sound remake of his 1926 version of Mary Roberts Rinehart's long running comedy/mystery play THE BAT. While the earlier version had the benefit of a better all around cast including Jack Pickford and Louise Fazenda (which deserves a quality DVD release), this version was shot in an early widescreen process called Magnavision (65mm) which allowed director West the opportunity to employ a startling array of visual tricks that still have the power to impress today. Chester Morris gives a strong performance as the detective who holds the key to the mystery. Una Merkel plays the heroine in one of her earliest roles and William Bakewell (the twin monarchs in Douglas Fairbanks' THE IRON MASK) acquits himself nicely in the thankless role of the wrongly accused fiance'. The story of a masked killer on the loose in an old dark house was already old hat by the time this film was made. The performances are deliberately over the top in accordance with the creakiness of the story which only adds to the fun. There is even a plea at the end to not reveal the killer's identity to future patrons.

What makes THE BAT WHISPERS so remarkable is its stunning cinematography, its expressionistic use of light and shadow and its innovative use of sound. The bat costume, though not as striking as in the 1926 version, helped to provide the inspiration for Bob Kane when he came to create BATMAN over 10 years later. Roland West was a premiere visual stylist and quite an innovator for his time. He was forced to give up directing in 1935 after the high profile death of his girlfriend actress Thelma Todd for which he is now believed responsible. The DVD from Image Entertainment contains both the 65mm and 35mm versions shot by different cameramen as well as outtakes, deleted scenes, etc. If you enjoy old style mysteries and want to see a little pop culture history as well then you can't afford to pass this one up. With the latest Batman installment THE DARK KNIGHT riding high, it's fun to go back and see where it all started and how far it's come since it first appeared. For The Joker's inspiration, check out the 1928 film THE MAN WHO LAUGHS.",1231891200,2,2185,4.704960835509138
1249222,3,B0000214FG,"THE BAT WHISPERS has a convoluted history more interesting than the film itself.  Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1957) created this tale of a master criminal skulking around a creepy country mansion as the 1907 novel THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE.  Critics were not impressed, but the public loved it--and in 1917 Rinehart joined forces with playwright Avery Hopwood to adapt it to the stage.  Retitled THE BAT, in 1920 it took Broadway by storm with its mixture of crazy characters, corny situations, and spooky atmosphere, and in 1926 film director Roland West brought the play to the screen.  Once again it proved a great success; not only was the film an audience favorite, it was critically well-regarded too.

It was also made just as sound began to roar.  In 1930 West decided to remake the film as a ""talkie.""  He also decided to add a few innovative bells and whistles in a visual sense as well.  Many directors of early sound films had enough to do in coping with sound technology--and so they tended to lock the camera down, a circumstance that gave most Hollywood films made between about 1929 and 1933 a visually static quality.  Not so West: THE BAT WHISPERS would be noted for a remarkably fluid camera that made the most of detailed minitures and lavish sets.  But more than this, THE BAT WHISPERS would truly stun audiences of the day via a widescreen format.

Widescreen format?  In 1930?  Surprising, yes, but true.  Directors had tinkered with widescreen formats since the silent era, with French director Able Gance's 1927 masterpiece NAPOLEON a case in point--but although interesting, the results were hit and miss.  With THE BAT WHISPERS, cinematographer Robert H. Planck nailed it flawlessly.  He also left something of a puzzle: film historians are still not entirely sure how he brought it off.  Most records seem to indicate that Planck actually shot the film on 35 mm, and then somehow managed to paste, cut, process, and reprint the original footage onto 70 mm.  Regardless of how it was done, the result is astonishing, and every one who saw the film was amazed.

Unfortunately, those who saw it were few and far between.  Theatre owners were still recovering from the expense of buying audio systems and they were not in a mood to pay for an expensive new screen and projection system as well.  When the film went into general release, it went in standard ratio filmed by cinematographer Ray June.  Again, it is hard to say exactly how this was done, but looking at both versions it would seem that June took a fair amount of Planck's footage, cropped it, and then re-shot most key scenes directly onto 35 milimeter stock.

We now come to something of a paradox.  Planck's widescreen version is both visually beautiful and innovative--but Planck and director West were pretty much working without any precedent and they weren't quite sure of what do with the effect once they had it.  Virtually everything is done in long shot, and when the camera isn't in motion THE BAT WHISPERS feels dry as dust and twice as slow.  The June version, however, makes solid use of close-ups and medium shots, and while it sometimes feels a bit jumpy it has a better flow and a significantly better pace.  Ironically, the June version is actually the more watchable of the two.

But I use the word ""watchable"" in a comparative sense here.  The style of acting that worked so well for silent film proved horrifically awkward in sound film, and directors and actors struggled for several years to find a new acting technique.  Both versions of THE BAT WHISPERS find the cast struggling in the gulf between old and new.  The Planck version tends to highlight the difficulties involved; the June version softens them--but whether it be Planck or June, the performances are chiefly notable for their awkward quality.

The plot is also antiquated.  Part of the charm of the novel, the 1920 play, and the 1926 film was the use of already old-fashioned plot ideas that had not yet worn out their welcome--but by 1930 the whole thing was wearing very thin, and it emerges here as overworked and lacking the necessary light touch.  Every thing about the story had become very cliched, and two years later director James Whale would wickedly spoof the entire genre with a film aptly titled THE OLD DARK HOUSE.  Although the Rinehart story received one more major turn before the cameras in 1959 with Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead, the type of plot involved is now more often done tongue-in-cheek, with such films as MURDER BY DEATH and CLUE cases in point.

So what, exactly, is the value of THE BAT WHISPERS for a modern, casual  viewer?  The answer, rather sadly, is ""not much.""  Hardcore fans of early 1930s film will likely enjoy the film, and film students interested in the history of cinematography cannot afford to miss it--but few others will be able to see beyond the awkward acting styles and now-absurd plot to experience the charm this film--in both widescreen and standard versions--had in 1930.

In terms of picture, the standard ratio version has the occasional blip and blemish but has weathered very well.  Although it has been restored, artifacts abound in the widescreen version; even so, the picture is very clean and they do not significantly detract from the film.  Sound quality is a problem in both versions, less so in the standard ratio version, more so in the widescreen version.  To some extent, this may be due to the recording technology of the era (actors tend to become fainter as they move away from the center of the sets), but it seems safe to say that the entire sound balance is off on this DVD release.  You'll have to turn up the volume all the way to hear it--and where the widescreen version is concerned you'll also have to sit by the speakers.

1249223,5,B0000214FG,"The Bat Whispers is definitely best of the ""Old Dark House/Clutching Hand"" type film I have ever seen (and that's covering about 53 years of movie viewing). This film held my attention from beginnning to end with creative model work, active camera movement and very imagenative camera angles and cinematography. This film is best viewed in the ""Widescreen"" version (This DVD contains both the 65MM experimental Widescreen version and standard Fullscreen versions)because it broadens the expanse of the settings and give you a broader view of what is taking place.
The characters are quite interesting and enjoyable and the acting is pretty straight forward for a film that was made right at the beginnig of the sound era. I also was amazed at how well the movie was able to keep the ""Bats'"" identity a secret. Neither I or any of my movie loving friends were able to figure out who he was until he is unmasked.
I had seen the original silent version simply titled ""The Bat"" (1926), also by director Roland West, some ten years ago and thought that it was a very creative film. But the original ""The Bat"" the eerie mood  was somewhat lessened by its silence so director Roland West realized this and refilmed a whole new movie with ""Sound"" and slight variations in the plotline.
If you are a fan of classic cinema ""The Bat Whispers"" should be on you list because they did not make many that are as creatively artistic or as well made as this one.",1174694400,3,1445,4.666666666666667

I must say I was pleased after reading up on all the hype of this movie. There were parts of it that were comical only because of the difference in time and when this was made. But you need to take all that into consideration when you watch this. If you can, put yourself back into the year this came out and just marvel at it.",1168300800,2,493,3.94
1249225,4,B0000214FG,"Take a trip to yesteryear with me and enjoy a thrilling ride from a time when sound was just making its' way onto the silver screen, adding a whole new dimension to the entertainment we now take for granted.  In this remake of his 1926 silent film The Bat, director Roland West gives his characters voices in The Bat Whispers (1930), which is based on a novel by Mary Roberts Rinehart.  Not having seen the silent original version, I am unable to provide a comparison of the two films, but I found much to like in this 'talkie' version.

The movie opens on a lovely miniature of Gotham at night, with a lush matte paining backdrop.  A slow pan down a large building leads us to policemen waiting outside the front of the building, and then we move inside through a lighted window.  The cinematography is quite exquisite here, worth watching more than once.  Inside the room is a man reading a letter, one written by The Bat, a criminal who claims he will steal a valuable necklace at 12 midnight, and dares the man to be alone in the room.  With police just outside the door and surrounding the building, The Bat manages to pull off an impossible caper in a unique and interesting way.  Soon we cut to a darkened bank, and someone opening the large safe, and making a hasty departure.  The fellow is followed to a large house, one occupied by an older woman, her maid, and a creepy caretaker.  The man who robbed the bank makes his way into the house, and is soon followed by a great number of characters.

First of all, let me just say this is one of the crazier plots in a movie I've seen in while.  Throughout the entire first half of the film, there were characters coming and going in the great, spooky house with secret passages, moving paintings, hidden rooms, and lights that fail almost on cue.  Some characters had formal introductions, some didn't, and confusion ran rampant.  It was like every five minutes or so, I found myself asking, ""Now who the heck is that?""  Eventually everyone is made known, some not until the end of the film, as the plot threads untangle themselves.  This is basically a crime/mystery/thriller with a dash of horror (the house is supposed to be haunted) and touches of comedy.  You see, there is a large amount of money hidden in the house, and various characters are trying to locate it, each for reasons of their own.  Not only that, but throw in a police detective, a private detective, a suspicious gardener, a man with amnesia, and arch criminal The Bat, and you've got quite the stew.  The red herrings certainly do begin to fly fast and furious as the plot barrels along to its' final act, to which I was highly satisfied as all was finally revealed.  In a nice touch, after the story ends, the film doesn't, as the audience is asked not to reveal the identity of The Bat, first as a plea, and then as an ominous warning, that if you do spill the beans to your friends, The Bat will haunt you up good.  While the acting in the film may never win anyone awards and such, it does fit with the characters and the story.  The under lit sets are wonderful, along with the cinematography, adding the moody atmosphere, playing with the light and darkness to create spooky shadows that serve well to send a chilling tingle up your spine.  And throw in the occasional thunder and flash of lighting and you've got all the makings of a suitably hair-raising thriller from an age long ago.

Available here are two versions of the film, one in the standard full screen 35 mm print, and another in a 65 mm `Magnifilm' format, providing a rare wide screen presentation of a pre-1950's film.  The wide screen format we are used to seeing nowadays wasn't really utilized throughout until the early to mid 1950's.  Both versions look really great, despite the fact that the film is 70 plus years old, and do suffer speckling and slight deterioration due to age.  The sound is a bit soft, but, again, given the age, one has to be somewhat generous in not being overly critical.  Along with basically two versions of the film, also included is extensive liner notes on the fold out cardboard cover of the DVD case.  The product information page here lists deleted scenes and alternative endings also available, but I didn't see those features.  Could be that I missed them, but the menu options on the disc are limited to choice of which format you want to watch and chapter stops.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, but if you like old films and have the patience to hang in there, you will be rewarded at the end.

The  video quality is very good but i agree, the sound is a little low but hey,  its great to have it.

1249227,3,B0000214FG,"I am a huge fan of 1930's films, so it was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch this DVD. Unfortunately it was not the exciting film I had expected. Firstly the good points: The picture quality for a film over 70 years old is amazingly good. The 65mm widescreen print is fairly speckled but boasts superb sharpness and contrast. The full frame version is less speckled but not quite as sharp. Nevertheless I was very impressed by the print quality for both versions. There is also frequent use of highly imaginative model shots and camera work throughout the movie. Now the bad points: Whilst the picture quality is terrific, this is another Image Entertainment DVD that suffers from lower than usual sound level - so be prepared to turn up the volume on your TV. The film itself contains some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Chester Morris gives a laughable performance and the rest of the cast aren't much better. As for the plot - what plot? We spend at least an hour watching various people climbing in and out of windows, opening and closing doors, shouting, crying, screaming, dying - leaving the viewer totally bemused as to what is supposed to be going on. Perhaps this was director Roland West's intention, but I think the audience would have been better served by fewer aimless characters and a stronger storyline. I take my hat off to Image Entertainment and other video companies for releasing these vintage films for everyone to enjoy. 'The Bat Whispers' is a very interesting piece of film history which has sadly dated quite badly. This movie is a film buff's dream but others may feel less enthusiastic. So if you want to watch strange goings on at an old dark house I recommend you check out Universal Picture's 'The Old Dark House' instead.",960681600,12,1776,4.677316293929713
1249228,4,B0000214FG,"Having been overwhelmed by Roland West's direction in the silent film ""The Bat,"" I was equally astonished at how easily he took to the sound medium for the talkie remake.  Most films of 1930 are immobile; here,  the camera cranes, spins, and dances between miniature sets, elaborate  mattes, and beautifully lit stages.  The final scene must have been  incredibly effective when shown in theatres.",946339200,10,397,5.140625

1249230,5,B0000214FG,"I enjoyed the movie very much, and it was kind of fun to get a French lesson at the same time.  Interesting to watch an old movie done in widescreen.

I dug a little deeper and discovered there was a USA DVD release of this wonderful movie. In fact, the US release contains both the original widescreen 65mm, and 3:4 35mm versions. Naturally I watched the 65mm version.  I had to purchase the USA movie used on eBay. But well worth every penny!

If others purchase the French version of this movie (sold here), please comment if you are successful at turning off the French subtitles. Even if you are unable to locate the original English version of this DVD, I would definitely buy the French one anyway. You see, the French subtitles are mostly below the screen anyway so the words don't overlay the image.

This movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. 10 out of 10. The special effects are 30 years ahead of its time. I was very impressed with how the miniatures merged seamlessly with the live action. Obviously, this director was trying to make a impact, and he did!

Regarding the DVD that I purchased from this site: I was unable to turn off the French subtitles.

When I use the DVD remote to switch off the subtitles I get a message on the screen that says, ""Not Permitted by Disk"".  This would imply that the DVD author set a flag to prevent switching off the subtitles. But why?",1424649600,2,1387,4.433070866141732
1249231,5,B0000214FG,"I have the silent version and the Vincent Price versions of this film, but it was a real pleasure to add this version to my collection.  The story is an old chestnut, but one of my favorites: an old dark house, hidden passages and no one seeming to be who they really are.  And was there ever anyone that could sneer like Chester Morris?  I think not!  The film appears to be in excellent condition and for an early talkie the sound is very good.  And those model shots!  Absolutely superb.  This disc also comes with an almost unique extra.  The film most people see was shot in a 1:33 - 1 aspect ratio, but it was also shot in a very early widescreen process akin to 70 mm. and this version is also available on this disc.  If you're a student of early sound film, or you just like a corny old mystery story, give this one a try.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable from both viewpoints.",1374278400,4,886,4.220238095238095

In terms of story and performances, ""The Bat Whispers"" probably seemed a bit stilted and stagey when originally released.  Time hasn't been kind to it,  but it's this over the top loopiness that drew me in and captivated me.  Much of what might have gotten by on the stage or in a silent film comes off as bizarre, but in a stylish, entrancing fashion.  In terms of camera work, sets,  and minatures, however, this film is astonishing good--outdoing many films that came along years later.

No,it's script is not groundbreaking or even necessarily all that memorable,but the visuals alone grant this a 5 star (or really more accurately 4 and a half star) rating from me. I'm aware that miniature models are used in it,but honestly,I never noticed them. It all looked real to me. Generally I am distracted by effects (blue screens,some cgi) because it is so obvious to me that what I'm seeing isn't real. Not in this case. The use of shadows and indulgence in breathtaking camera work just for the sake of beauty is entirely appealing and I appreciated every second of it. And unlike Vampyr,the German film from the same era,I don't feel the excessive use of effects gets in the way of the storyline.
 Now for the dvd:I was fortunate enough to pay very little for from a video store that was going out of business. Had I paid a high price for it,I would have been very disappointed by the audio. It's fairly clear,but is so low I only heard maybe 60% of the dialogue. And there is no closed caption,which really is poor considering a large segment of the population won't be able to enjoy this dvd at all.(I would definitely have chosen the closed caption option had it been available. It would have been a great help.)
Update August 2012: I saw a copy of the film on vhs at a yard sale. I decided to pick it up (first time I have bought a movie on vhs that I already own on dvd). Vhs tends to have louder audio than dvd because it is not compressed the way dvd audio is,so I figured I might stand a better chance at understanding the dialogue. Well,the audio is just a bit louder but still hard to hear. I understood a few more lines. The picture is not as sharp,as would be expected,so it's kind of a toss which is better.

1249238,5,B0000214FG,"This is a wonderful find. Roland West teams with star Chester Morris once again to give us ""The Bat Whispers"" a year after the same team gave us ""Alibi"", one of the very good films from 1929, and a Best Picture nominee from the 1928-1929 season.

West uses some of the same photographic techniques that were ground-breaking in ""Alibi"". The camera moves along so you see what the police see as they ride along in their squad cars, and now the camera also swoops up the sides of buildings and ""flies into"" rooms at a birds-eye (or bats-eye) view.

""The Bat"" is a super-criminal. He taunts the police by telling them what he intends to do next and then performs his crime under their noses. He dresses and moves like Batman, has the Joker's indifference to human life and confidence in his own immortality, but unlike the Joker his motive is not chaos - it is unmitigated greed. In that way he is like a merging of Batman, the Joker, and Bank of America.

The rather complex plot involves a bank that has been robbed in which the suspect is a young teller who is in love with Una Merkel's character. Her aunt has rented an old dark house from the bank owner's son. However, someone is trying to frighten her into leaving.  There are secret rooms and passageways, the mysterious activities of several guests involved, and the presence of Chester Morris as a police inspector who arrives on the scene. For some strange reason he is dressed as a middle-aged man here, and I could never figure out the reason for that one. The questions are - who is The Bat, is he at work here, is he working alone, and what is he after?

The only negative is the maid in the old dark house. She is constantly screaming and yelping at every little noise. By the film's midpoint I was ready to dress up like The Bat and get rid of this annoying person myself. Alas, she survives until the end of the film without really adding anything. I get the fact that scary things are going on. I didn't need her 90 minute conniption fit to drive that point home.

If you love early talkies you have to see this one. It came before Batman and Universal's old dark house sound films, so it actually is more original than the modern viewer might give it credit. The video quality is excellent, but the sound seems just a little muffled at times, which would be typical for the time that it was made.",1247184000,3,2362,4.405963302752293

Has no background music, which gives it a silent film quality.  The DVD has the 35mm and the 65mm versions available.  (Remade, very entertainingly in the late 50's, as The Bat, starring Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead).  The Milestone Collection Image Entertainment DVD is excellent quality, probably the best available.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1453507200,,655,5.230769230769231

7915266,3,B0000214FG,"This review refers to the Milestone Collection DVD from 1999, which I recently popped into my Blu Ray player to enjoy the widescreen version. ARRRGGG! This is a letterboxed 4:3 DVD; the widescreen version is surrounded by huge black bars and only utilizes about 33% of your widescreen TV. You can zoom in if you'd like, but the resolution will suffer greatly.

In Milestone's defense, this type of thing happened a lot back in the nineties. But if you're planning on spending big bucks for this out-of-print DVD just to watch the rare widescreen version, save your pennies until they re-release it on a proper 16:9 DVD or, better yet, a Blu Ray.",1445212800,,645,4.707964601769912
