7874946,5,6304622686,Very good. Been trying to find a copy of this for years and finally found it. The historical context is great.,1384646400,,110,4.285714285714286
7874947,5,6304622686,Excellent movie!  An actual WWII event that has not been widely reported.  Both the German and Canadian stance will get you thinking.,1373760000,,133,5.0
7874948,4,6304622686,"I read the other reviews and agree with all.  I bought the dvd which does skip at times and have quality control problems.  That being said, I liked the story line.  I did some research and there was one instance that is similar to this story.  Though the film said this was a true story, that is not factual.  There were two German Kriegsmarine sailors who were executed by German troops while POWs for desertion with the approval of their Canadian POW camp guards.  I saw this film many years ago and the memory of it haunted me to where I had to buy it again.  I only gave the film 4 stars because of the quality of the dvd.  As for the script and story line, I give it a 5 star rating.",1310515200,,689,4.08955223880597
7874949,5,6304622686,"After the war has ended on it's last days, soldiers still obey and must decide if they should kill or not. Psychological thriller with a lot of violence. I would definetly pick this up for such a good price becaue it is well worth it.",1107475200,3,234,4.222222222222222
7874950,1,6304622686,"During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Italian movie industry made a number of World War II films. They ranged from trash to average to occasionally excellent. THE FIFTH DAY OF PEACE represents the best of the genre. Chances are you wouldn't be looking at the DVD if you didn't already know what the film was about.
The DVD quality is appalling. The print is muddy and smeary, mastered from a video tape. You know how when a VCR may start to eat a tape, it leaves those crinkles on the actual tape and you get the telltale ""skips"" on the TV screen when you watch the damaged part of the tape? Well, those same type skips show up during part of the credits. The colors look worn out as well. The sound is monophonic and a little muffled. There is a brief yet loud and annoying buzz about 40 minutes into the film as well. The sound is not always in synchronization with the picture, either. It's not because of the dubbing, though. I have compared with my video copy. There are plenty of digital artifacts off and on as well.  The screen-shots for the 10 chapter scenes and those of Johnson and Nero look excellent, but do not compare well to the picture quality of the actual film.
The DVD is 1.33:1, cropped from the original letterbox print of 2.35:1. Portions of words are missing from both the sides of the screen and the bottom of the screen during parts of the credits.
It looks as though the folks at Simitar might have just recorded this from a TV screen with a video camera. An enterprising way to save money but also a great way to lose business.
For ""special"" features there are 10 chapter searches, movie factoids which provide no information not found on the case, and abridged biographies and filmographies for Richard Johnson and Franco Nero.
I piad [a small amount] for this and still thought it was a waste. My video from Congress Entertainment, while still lower quality, is better than this DVD.",1026000000,13,1918,4.495702005730659
7874951,1,6304622686,"If you want to impress your friends with your new DVD player then (...) don't show them this film. It's a straight forward copy from a video tape that will have you reaching for the tracking button (if only) and the sound is not in sync with the picture. The acting is wooden and the plot is dire. If you are fool enough to buy this, don't come crying to me when you realise I'm right!",1007510400,8,385,4.078947368421052
7874952,5,6304622686,"A very grim movie about German deserters at the end of WWII, who are captured by Canadian forces. Their former comrades in arms (led by the senior German POW played by Helmuth Schneider) also held by the Canadians,  sentence them to be shot and persuade the weak Canadian Captain (played by  Richard Johnson) egged on by his General (Michael Goodliffe) to carry out  the sentence. No attempt here to glamorise war. Everything is very bleak,  but the film is a superb character study and all the performances are  excellent. Best ever performance by Richard Johnson. Only major criticism  is of the unconvincing Canadian accents.
The movie was never released in  the UK (and maybe not in the USA either). It was released in Germany under  the name ""Gott Mit Uns"" (God with us)",959126400,13,775,4.774436090225564
