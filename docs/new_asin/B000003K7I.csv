Teleplay by: Mark Gehred O'Connell
Story by: Hilary Bader & Evan Carlos Somers
Directed by: Jonathan Frakes
""Meridian"" is one of those low-budget-romantic-TV-movie-turned-into-star-trek kind of episodes. We have a plot about a planet that shifts between dimencions, being 60 years at a time in a foreign dimencion and a couple of days in our own.
The crew of the Defiant just happen to stumble upon it just as it makes it's once-in-sixty-years shift to our universe, and Jazia Dax just happens to fall suddenly in lovewith one of the natives.
We also get a sub plot concerning a rich businesmann visiting DS9 and ending up lusting after Major Kira and ordering a sex programme from Quark featuring our good Major.
Even Jonathan Frakes's competent directing or Terry Farrel's talented performance can't do much for this episode, wich is all about a weak plot combined with old fascioned storytelling.",1010016000,,923,5.119205298013245
