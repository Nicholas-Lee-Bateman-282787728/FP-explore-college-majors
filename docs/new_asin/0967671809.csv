Particularly well done was the inside out dynamic, allowing the viewer to experience what this disease can do to a sufferer in a most relevant and acurate perspective.",1140825600,,341,4.896551724137931

7794030,1,0967671809,"I notice that Cassandra Sanchez has written 6 positive reviews posing as a teacher, a policeman, a doctor etc.  But click on the about me link and they all use the same account!
I saw this same behaviour when the film sellers tried to spam this film on schizophrenia.com. They posted reviews parroting the same ones they have posted before.
The film makers may have had good intentions, but their marketing schemes are signs of desperation.",1000252800,,440,4.7894736842105265
7794031,5,0967671809,"After many years, dealing with my son's disorder, (schizophrenia), I must admit I was quite skeptical when I purchased a copy of ""What's Wrong with the Neighbor's Son?"". After reveiwing this film many times, I must report, without reservation, this film blew me away! Not only did I finally get an opportunity to see life through my son's eyes, but I also now have a tool to show others in my circle, just what Schizophrenia is all about. I am not a doctor, but I feel that as a parent of a child whom has suffered the horrors of this disease for so long, I feel quallified to rate this movie 5 stars..all the way! Thank you Amazon for featuring such a wonderful product.  K.T.",984096000,3,677,4.416

7794033,5,0967671809,"Both as a Police officer and a brother of my 19 year old sister, whom suffers from Schizophrenia, I must applaud this films efforts in conveying a very possible and accurate scenario of what might be happening inside the  mind of a mentally ill person. I have encountered many mentally ill  homeless persons over the past 8 years as a New York City police officer  and hope that other police personel around the U.S.A. will have an  opportunity to see this film in its entirety, as I am quite sure that they  will all benefit from such an eye opening experience, allowing them to deal  more effectively and with more empathy with the mentally ill they will come  in contact with in the future! I reccomend this movie to all lay citizens  as well.",956188800,3,746,4.514925373134329
