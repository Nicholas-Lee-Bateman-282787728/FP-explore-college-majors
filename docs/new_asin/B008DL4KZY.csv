5153390,1,B008DL4KZY,"A degrading, stupid, colossal bomb (not in a good way) of a movie.  Impaired and offensive and worst of all ""unfunny"" on almost all levels.  Brody has a few moments of squint-eyed bewilderment. ""What?""  Wonder how long it took to do his hair and tats?  How many years has this dud been on the shelf?  Not long enough.  Adults made this.  (And does the phrase ""Jesus F*****g Christ"" really make this funny?  If this kind of language was aimed at Islam or Jews, just imagine the response.)",1346284800,4,487,4.517241379310345
5153391,5,B008DL4KZY,"Sadly, ""High School"" was only released in a handful of theatres this summer...If it didn't make it to your town, you need to buy a copy!  It is the funniest movie I have ever watched.  I saw it at Sundance a few years ago and have been eagerly wating for it to hit the theatres so all of my friends could see the movie I have been blathering about for two years.  I am really disapointed that it didn't reach a larger audience, I was certain that it would be the next Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Hopefully it can have a great DVD life!  Show your support for independent film makers who have the stones to make a comedy that isn't a stupid rom-com starring Ashton Kutcher...that said, if you are a fan of Ashton Kutcher rom-coms...this movie probably isn't for you.",1342051200,2,768,4.3426573426573425

5153425,3,B008DL4KZY,"I wanted to see this movie because I am terribly fond of Colin Hanks as an actor. Unfortunately, he was not a lead actor in the movie. The plot was okay. I don't expect ""reality"" when I watch a movie, but I still felt stretched a bit. I will say Aiden Brody was fabulous! Watch this movie if you can handle disappointment. Not on the stoner-flick caliber of Dazed and Confused, but worth a watch. I would not buy.",1364774400,,413,4.2405063291139244

I showed this movie to a lot of friends that smoke and they all thought it was funny, myself included.

Near the end where the MC gives his English final, just about everyone thought it was pretty lame.

Pretty funny to see the chick that voices Lisa Simpson in this movie get all baked.",1361491200,,374,4.23943661971831
5153428,3,B008DL4KZY,"This is a really strange movie about a couple high school students that get this idea to steal drugs, put them in brownies, bring them to school and get everyone (and I mean *everyone*) super high.  While having this as the theme for an entire movie is sort of funny and there's a few classic parts (involving teachers humiliating themselves in particular) the jumbled pacing and the many almost plotless segments really drag (hehe) this one down.

For example, the entire first 25 minutes are pointless and don't include a storyline of any sorts, so we encounter a big problem there.  Big enough you might be tempted to stop watching the movie altogether.  The movie is supposed to be about one of the students concerned that his drug-taking habits will get him expelled and unable to get into college when a drug testing policy goes into effect, and you just have to wait a while for this aspect of the storyline to develop.

Really hilarious that Adrien Brody -the same man who plays a well-respected high school teacher in the film Detachment released one year after this film- would play a junkie searching for the kids who stole his marijuana, haha.  Also hilarious how everyone in the school just suddenly decides that they have a huge craving for a brownie!

The truth is, I don't know how accurate this movie captures the effects of drug use since I've never done any myself (seriously never, not even once for the sake of experimenting- I must have been an uncool goody two shoes!)  If it's portrayed in a completely inaccurate way then the film fails.  However if it *is* accurate, well, this movie might become a 4-star film one day.  Still, the lack of a really understandable plot hurts this one a tad.  I recommend a viewing, but just barely.",1361232000,,1757,4.672077922077922
5153429,3,B008DL4KZY,I was hoping the movie would be alittle better but it was a good watch for the price although i find myself unable to finish it again. it was delivered on time and in good shape,1360195200,,177,3.9444444444444446
5153430,5,B008DL4KZY,"I usually don't like stoner films; they just don't work for me. Often, they are too reliant on sight gags and toilet-bowl humor. Now, there are some moments like this in the movie, but it's the acting that makes this movie hilarious. Simply put, Chiklis and Brody are awesome. They're in a Daniel Day Lewis acting zone. Chiklis is side-splitting funny. I cannot get over how funny that guy was. He makes Jeffrey Jones' (AKA Ed Rooney) performance in Ferris Bueller look like a joke, and I liked Jones in that movie. I didn't even realize it was Chiklis until I saw the end credits. Completely amazing work. Brody, too, was in the acting zone. He was both hilarious and, actually, a little disturbing. He seemed like he was off the deep end. He reminded me somewhat of Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood."" I've never seen Brody perform anything like this ever.

The other two leads, Bush and Marquette, did well enough. In a sense, they were just along for the ride. It was Brody and, especially, Chiklis who make this movie worth watching. Rarely does a stoner comedy have one good performance-let alone two great performances. Overall, I say this might be the best stoner movie ever. I like Harold and Kumar, but that movie relied too much on sight gags and other less-than-satisfactory stoner crutches. For the record, I actually sat through this movie twice in just one week. (It was on cable again, and I like to test movies with a second viewing to see if they still have the special something.) The second viewing was as funny or almost as funny as the first viewing. Chiklis just blows me away. I'm even getting giddy just thinking about his scenes. Don't miss this one. It's a shame it did so well at Sundance-just to be punted around for two years before getting released in 2012.",1357516800,,1795,4.609375
5153431,5,B008DL4KZY,Hilarious! I laughed so so hard! One of the funniest movies this year! Adrien Brody's perfomance was unexpected and excellent!,1357257600,,126,5.35
5153432,3,B008DL4KZY,This movie was ok. I thought it would of been different. I'll give it to my nephew. He'll like it.,1355961600,,98,3.95
5153433,5,B008DL4KZY,Hilarious movie. I love Adrian Brody's role in the movie. The two main characters were perfect. Honestly better than Mac &Devin go to high school. Must see!,1355529600,,156,4.814814814814815
5153434,5,B008DL4KZY,"I sat down to watch ""High School"" with no preconceived notions about the movie.  All I knew was that Michael Chiklis was in it and that was good enough for me.  I can't say Chiklis stole the show here, but he played a part so different than what he's played recently in Vegas and The Shield that my wife didn't even recognize him.  Chiklis plays a high school principal hell bent on getting drugs out of his school but of course that becomes impossible to do when honors student and soon to be class valedictorian Henry, played by Matt Bush, decided to toke up for the first time the day before a school-wide drug testing program is implemented.

Henry and his stoner friend Travis, played by Sean Marquette, decide that if EVERYONE fails the drug test then nobody can really be held accountable.  Sound thinking, right?  Well, in order to get enough drugs to dose the whole student body they have to rip off the local drug dealer ""Psycho Ed,"" played with gusto by Adrien Brody who absolutely steals the show here.  ""Psycho Ed"" is one part Snoop Dogg and one part white suburban lawyer who had a nervous break down.  He somehow comes off as hilarious and terrifying at the same time!

There's no doubt that the premise here is over the top, the characters are over the top and the delivery here is over the top.  All of that doesn't take away from the fun of the ride.  There are a ton of ""stoner comedies"" out there but this one really does stand on its own as a movie with a little more substance to it.  Well worth the rental for Brody's performance alone!",1354406400,4,1559,4.4125874125874125
5153435,3,B008DL4KZY,This movie had a good idea that I enjoyed watching for a second time. I watched it a second time and I have to say that it surprised me to see that it wasn't that bad.,1353110400,,167,3.6666666666666665
5153436,5,B008DL4KZY,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Adrien Brody does an awesome job portraying a psychotic drug dealer. Michael Chiklis takes it to a different level playing a paranoid, perverted high school principle. Which is a little different than other roles I've seen him play, but the red hair is a little freaky.",1350259200,,314,4.625

Was kind of disappointed I didn't purchase it right off the bat, but I will definitely pick up a copy soon.  Will sit well next to my copies of Half Baked, Harold & Kumar etc.  Definitely worth a watch.  Indie-er films are coming up these days!",1349913600,,366,4.46969696969697

5153441,3,B008DL4KZY,"""Drugs, fornicating, a grown man singing about his feelings, it's time we win this war, expunge this school of all dope fiends."" Henry Burke (Bush) has everything going for him. He has a scholarship to MIT and is in line to be his classes valedictorian. After an accident leads to detention he is brought back together with his old friend Travis (Marquette). They decide to take a break that night and unwind with a joint. After the school's representative in the national spelling bee loses it on TV the principal (Chiklis) institutes a mandatory drug test for everyone in the school. Fearing he will lose everything Henry and Travis come up with a plan. I am not really a fan of ""stoner' comedy (I did like the Harold & Kumar movies) but the plot to this and the cast made it seem interesting to me. I was not disappointed. Adrien Brody is very funny as the man they steal from and Colin Hanks is good as a clueless asst. principle but Michael Chiklis steals the movie. Playing a clueless borderline pervert in charge of the school he is perhaps the funniest clueless principal since Ed Rooney. This is a very different style of stoner comedy and it is more like ""Girl Next Door"" then ""Pineapple Express"". This is nothing amazing but I enjoyed it and laughed quite a bit. Overall, a funny movie you can just put in and not think about, those are fun sometimes. I give it a B.",1346544000,,1377,4.49003984063745

Matt Bush is excellent as the straight A student and Sean Marquette is wonderful as the stoner but I have to say that for a teen comedy the entire cast was fun and very good. Even Michael Chiklis as the principal was having a good time. You have to see Adrian Brody...What?....What! He is hysterical. Kudos to all involved for a very entertaining and fun movie, some very good laughs to be sure. You have to like this kind of raunchy and drug comedy to get this and still laugh about it.
