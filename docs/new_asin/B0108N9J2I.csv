7306504,4,B0108N9J2I,"Heartwarming and funny movie with Aussie flavour but universal appeal. Inspired by a true story, Paper Planes is great for kids but can be enjoyed by the whole family.

This film was a great feel-good movie that is definitely a great family night film that not only teaches a good lesson, but inspires hope, displays how hard work pays off, and is an all-around enjoyable to watch while even grappling with a few family discussion topics that are worth exploring in relation to the father's life, the challenge of the loss of a family member, and real-life relationships.

This movie showed the importance of character development and loving family relationships, a rare sight in the world these days.  I wish I could personally thank the writers of this film as well as everyone who worked on it.  My family thoroughly enjoyed it and it was so fitting for the timing of watching it, as our oldest son ran in his USATF Association XC Championship today.  Teaching children to have fun and focus on the most important thing, love, is such important lessons.

There are some very heartfelt and touching moments in the film that deals with very deep issues regarding grief. But, there are many moments of great humor as well. It's a wonderful balance. As always, I love me some Sam Worthington but it is Ed Oxenbould who truly carries this movie. He is a wonderfully entertaining actor and his character brings heart and great insight into life to the movie.

It seems EVERY kid movie has something about bullying in it, making it seem like you can't exist without a bully in your life, which my son and I have talked about since I started letting him watch movies-so ridiculous. Always gotta add in extra drama of a bully no matter what. But while this film also added in the ""bully"" factor, it actually was the best role model for how to handle a situation like that I have ever seen in any child movie.  This child was such an inspiration to children and adults alike. And the way he handled, grief, competition, and interacted with the girl in movie as well. Everything was just so shockingly high level behavior, it is such a RARE find in a movie these days. That is sad, but true.",1461715200,5,860,4.296296296296297

7306797,4,B0108N9J2I,"I didn't have very high expectations for this movie, a movie about making and flying paper planes, how interesting can that be?  That was my concern, but even though ultimately after watching and reflecting on it, there really isn't a great deal more to the film than that, I still enjoyed the movie, which is well carried by child actor  Ed Oxenbould (The Visit, Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day)  who isn't just the lead but is in pretty much every second of the film.  Sam Worthington has a very minor role as his depressed dead beat dad, who would rather watch videos or sleep on a couch than go to work, let alone communicate or watch his child excel at something and be top of his classmates, for what you imagine is the first time.  His character certainly isn't likable in what otherwise is a very light film that isn't taking itself seriously at all, but as I said, he really isn't in it much.  Child characters are the other main screen time ones, and although you're likely not to have heard of the actors in those roles, they do a pretty decent job.

The basic plot of this revolves around Dylan a 12 year old kid in a small town who is economically poor, as well as somewhere near the bottom of the school pecking order.  He is mildly being bullied by an overweight kid who quickly becomes his friend when Dylan calls him out on it when the two are alone and the boy admits he hasn't a friend before and would love to be his.  One day a paper plane competition official visits their school, so making and flying planes becomes part of the curriculum for two days.  Dylan's plane outperforms everyone else's easily breaking the distance required to compete in the championships.  Only problem is he can't replicate the feat again.  But he has a couple of days before official try outs.  Of course he'd love his dad to help him but that isn't likely to happen, so his eccentric grandfather at the nursing home, his former bully, his teacher and others will all offer encouragement and advice.  If he's good enough he can go to the Australian championships in Sydney, if one of the best their he can compete in the world junior championships in Japan.

I liked the movie, it is obviously fairly predictable being a kids film and all. Some of the following the paper planes in flight definitely looked computer animated rather than real. You could nitpick things like someone can get from Australia to Japan in a couple of hours not including driving from some town so far away from Sydney Airport that it only has dirt roads. If Dylan was too poor to buy a plane ticket why did he stay in a five star hotel wherever he went? If the paper plane competition paid for the hotels why not the flight there too? But kids don't probably think about these things. It is set in a version of our world where a paper plane flying competition for kids not only packs a massive arena with spectators, but is also broadcast live around the world. I did also wonder why the town had a vehicle for its ambulance that was discontinued in the 70's and why the local bus looked like something from the 1920's.

Not sure what you get on the DVD as extras with the one sold here on Amazon but the Australian DVD gives a look at the real people who made and designed the planes in the movie and they give tutorials and advice on what to include in whatever design you come up with to make it fly further.",1458000000,,3416,4.406995230524642

We spent a long time wondering what happened to the mother, only to learn she died in a car accident. But they don't just mention it - they keep showing vids of this throughout the whole movie. It's really the main theme of the movie.

So, not a children's movie. But the problem is that since it has stuff in it that is totally imaginary - like Remote Controlled planes that fly around without anyone controlling them, and paper planes doing things they cannot, it should be just for children.",1452988800,2,690,4.556451612903226

Rest-assured, the movie is full of cute cliches, but the shining light of this film is truly Sam Worthington, who is at his finest as Jack, a father who is struggling with depression and grief due to his wife's untimely death. Sometimes, it's horribly painful to watch him struggle to be there for his child, and it's one of the more realistic depictions of depression I've seen on film.",1452297600,5,607,4.682242990654205

The plot of a young 12 year old boy who, living with his father, finds his way to a top competition despite having the odds stacked against him kept me engaged. I was rooting for him as he persevered through family and school issues to hone his skills and move up in the competition. His journey made me feel sorry for him and his plight and hope that something gets fixed before he gets permanently broken. All in all, although the subject matter was different and the plot predictable, I found this entertaining and would have enjoyed watching it with a 10 to 12 year old to inspire them to get off their electronics and stretch their skills.",1452297600,,787,4.360544217687075

Paper Planes is a good movie that explores the lives of an all male household. Dad is widowed, and son Dylan has lost his loving and attentive mother. Dad, played by Sam Worthington is laid low with depression. Dylan [Ed Oxenbould] is a bright and self-sufficient lad who has compassion. Every day Dylan feeds a hawk with whom he shares a field of traverse with.

Dylan is a mentally healthy kid with enough self-esteem that he turns several bullies that cross his path into friends, or at least pals. Without very much help from adults, he accomplishes a lot. He shows more emotional maturity than his father and grandfather.

This movie is about much more than ""Paper Planes"". The main thread about the paper planes and competition is fun and leaves several nuggets of wisdom for any viewer.

I would recommend this movie for our Juvenile section of the library.

**Content - There is no sexual content, even though Grandpa does have his groove on at the nursing home.
  - Language - there may be a curse word or two in there, nothing stood out to me. This is based in Australia, so I may have missed that.
  - Violence -  there is some violence [from bullying], but it is muted and there is no blood and gore.",1448755200,,1354,5.031390134529148

7306883,5,B0108N9J2I,"Great movie, they just need to fix the subtitles. They don't start until halfway through the movie and are the wrong words. Subtitles would be very helpful with the accents.",1448582400,,173,4.8
7306884,3,B0108N9J2I,"This movie had many good qualities, such as, family values, hospitality, friendship, achievement. It was a wholesome movie that could be enjoyed by most families. I loved the great representation of both the Australian and Japanese cultures regarding a competition. As in most stories it contained a good and bad character. Also a beautiful girl who is very talented. She offers advice just like an adult.
The problem I had with the film involved the theme or moral of the story. I found it very unrealistic and unfair to describe a child of twelve as an adult; and an adult who is more like an irresponsible child. This role reversal may mean very little to others, but it was noticeable to me.
For instance, the child of twelve is told to solve his own problems. He must ""figure it out."" The adults never offer any help. No twelve years old takes a plane to travel to an unknown country by himself. No twelve years old calls back home to check up on the adult and then offer him advice. I disliked the bad character's total disrespect of his own parent and the lack of any discipline.
It all ends well but is very predictable. I would have enjoyed the story more if it honored the adult and the child in a realistic way. Adults must be the role model and set the example for the children. This is how real life works.",1448496000,,1319,4.454545454545454

It's very tame and appropriate for all ages and won't offend any sensibilities.

The movie does deal with loss of a loved one but the drama is kept to a minimum and overall it has a lighthearted feel.  Def. a good movie for family night.",1445731200,8,493,4.191489361702128

He meets a sweet girl from Japan who teaches him how to make a bird using origami. Also the grandfather (a former pilot) is playful and a lot of fun. And a bunch of other stuff happens.
