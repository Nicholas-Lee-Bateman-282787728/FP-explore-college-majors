From my experience as a professional public school teacher, I have some concerns:
  1.  At times the music is too loud, making it hard to hear the speaker.  The music is sometimes annoying and overly dramatic.
  2.  Too many facts about the sun are given and are given too quickly.  It's hard to recall what's been said.
  3.  The facts should be explained and discussed, with regular summaries of some of the facts presented in a list on the screen.
Overall, therefore, the film is not worth viewing.",1389398400,,595,4.571428571428571
7788353,5,0740318942,"A fast-moving documentary on the most important planetary body in our solar system outside earth. The presentation is plain from the start regarding its convictions, that the sun is a specially created object by God on day four of the universe as stated in Holy Scripture (Genesis 1.16).

The accepted stellar evolutionary model of any star's origin is shown to rest on faith alone. A gas cloud supposedly collapsed under gravity, triggered either by a compression force (a supernova shock front), or convective heat transfer/refrigeration (by thin dust particles). Both ideas rely on a star having already existed!

Under the solar nebular disk model, once our sun 'evolved', terrestrial planets are said to have formed from a swirling cloud of dust clumps ('planetesimals'). A transition from small [1cm] to large [1km] bodies is believed by faith.

The well-known Faint Young Sun Paradox is also discussed with the following miracles invoked to solve it: a greenhouse gas atmosphere (inc. CH4 and NH3) on earth to avoid it freezing; dissipation and replacement of this atmosphere with our current one over billions of years; resulting heat reduction precisely compensated for by heat increase from the strengthening sun!

Authoritative testimony is given by scientists Drs. Danny Faulkner, Ron Samec and Jason Lisle who are clearly unimpressed with current secular evolutionary models.

Visuals and graphics are excellent and interspersed well across the presentation. The viewer will be amazed at the unique properties of our sun amongst stars and the faith evolutionists have believing its creation without a supernatural creator.",1387324800,2,1635,5.421259842519685
