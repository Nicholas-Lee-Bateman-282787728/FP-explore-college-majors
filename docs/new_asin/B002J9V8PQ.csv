8371325,4,B002J9V8PQ,"This DVD contains both the English and Spanish versions of ""Dinosaur Attack! (Dino Ataque)"". This documentary aired on the Discovery Channel in 1999, and is the first documentary to ever focus on the Paluxy River trackway in Valley State Park, Texas. This trackway shows the footprints of a giant theropod dinosaur, Acrocanthosaurus, following a Pleurocoelus (giant sauropod dinosaur). What made this program most famous is the 3D recreation of the Acrocanthosaurus attacking the Pleurocoelus, which some think is shown in the trackway by a missing footprint (showing that the Acro ""hopped"" on the back of its prey), and the subtle changes in direction of the prints. The animation was done by Pixel Kitchen Studios, and is quite dated now, but was pretty good for its time. The Acro looks fairly cartoony, and walks a bit awkwardly, but it is still a compelling scene to watch, with great music and atmosphere.

Another neat thing shown in this documentary is the small inside look at sculptor Dave Thomas' studio. Dave Thomas has since passed away, but his sculptures are huge, eye-catching, and colorful, showing dinosaurs in dynamic and expressive poses. (He was the one who made the Acrocanthosaurus sculpture seen on the back of the truck, which they took to the trackway to see how well the foot fit the prints. Incidentally, the 3D Acro strongly resembles his sculpture.) It also shows beautifully dramatic shots of the Acro skeleton, a very rare dinosaur of which only one almost complete specimen has been found to date.

There's several inaccuracies in this documentary, most notably that Acrocanthosaurus could not run and breathe at the same time (an outdated hypothesis based on the idea that dinosaurs are more reptile-like than bird-like: we now know that Acro's relatives had an air-sac system much like modern birds, and were warm blooded. This means that they had a very active predatory lifestyle). They also say that Pleurocoelus was cold blooded, but this too has been disproven in recent years. Some of the narration is a little too dramatic and plays into the belief that dinosaurs are nothing but monsters, and not the living, breathing animals with complex behavior that we now know them to be. Still, I love this documentary for nostalgic value alone, and it is a must-see for any dinosaur enthusiast.",1382400000,,2328,5.044155844155844
