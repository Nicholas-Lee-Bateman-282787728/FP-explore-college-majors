8489868,5,B0008FPILS,"I got the first volume of Otogi Zoshi a few weeks ago. It was good. The animation is different from a lot of the the anime floating around. It doesn't look or feel quite as cartoon-ish. It seems more real, as if 'this is from Japan's history'.

The second volume has more romance than the first volume and you get more insight as to how the characters are really feeling.

I'd recommend this DVD to someone who is looking for some thing a little more realistic than most anime.",1118966400,8,477,4.348314606741573
