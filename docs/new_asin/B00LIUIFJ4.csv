6488063,5,B00LIUIFJ4,"'Republic of Doyle' is fast, furious, funny and - as a result - highly entertaining.
Its fifth season upholds that tradition in fine fashion.
Season Five features (in no particular order) a fierce - and fiercely beautiful - female Mexican police officer, corrupt politicians, a world class computer hacker, a baseball bat wielding bookie, bad bikers, lost-and-found loves and some unusual plot twists.
Often compared to the old American private eye series 'The Rockford Files,' Season Five of 'Republic of Doyle' pays a small tribute to that much-beloved show by casting Stuart Margolin in one adventure. Margolin played Angel Martin in 'The Rockford Files' and, though he doesn't re-create that role in this adventure, he plays a character with some very similar attributes - including the fact that he often bails in the face of trouble, leaving Jake Doyle to fend for himself.
Season Five also features an appearance by 'Bill Murdoch,' a Toronto cop who comes from a long line of Toronto cops. Yes, for those of you who have ever seen 'The Murdoch Mysteries' featuring a turn-of-the-century detective who pioneers the use of technology in crime solving, this episode has Yannick Bisson as a guest star. In a previous season of 'The Murdoch Mysteries,' another very fine Canadian detective show, Det. William Murdoch journeys to St. John's, Newfoundland to solve a crime and meets one of Jake Doyle's ancestors. In this Season Five episode, Jake and 'Bill' team up to foil a crime. At the end of the episode this current incarnation of Murdoch turns to Jake and says 'is it just me or does it feel like we've done this before?' It's small touches like that which make 'Republic of Doyle' a real pleasure to watch.
Two final notes: Sgt. Leslie Bennett, who has long been the object of Jake Doyle's affections, leads a very complicated life in Season Five, which is enhanced by the appearance of Natasha Henstridge as her new boss, and Jake discovers that he just might be the father of a very engaging but extremely amoral young thief.
Season Five is all that a top-flight detective show ought to be and I highly recommend it.",1416441600,4,2127,4.878453038674033
6488064,5,B00LIUIFJ4,"Republic of Doyle at it's finest. I love this show, it's set in my hometown of St. John's, Newfoundland in Canada. They characters are amazing and they show off my town so well. Many of my friends have seen the show and want to visit. Allan Hawco is the showrunner, one of the writers and main character on the show. He has done us proud!",1416096000,4,338,4.2153846153846155
6488065,5,B00LIUIFJ4,Very amusing and funny. Found myself laughing out loud many times.,1414800000,,66,5.090909090909091

6488067,5,B00LIUIFJ4,This is an awesome fun show! I am so glad they released it on DVD so those of us in the USA can see it. It made me sad when I heard that the 6th and finally season is now showing in Canada. I can't wait until the DVD of S6 is available so I can buy it :) I own S1 - S5,1413849600,4,268,3.203125
6488068,5,B00LIUIFJ4,"OMG!  This is an awesome series.  My Mom is from Newfoundland and this was filmed in Newfoundland.  This past summer, my daughter and I went there and had a ball.  The people are incredibly nice and the scenery is fantastic.  The series is wonderful.  The way the father and son are is really funny.  I would purchase this again.",1413331200,4,329,4.47457627118644
6488069,5,B00LIUIFJ4,This series is TERRIFIC!,1437264000,,24,5.25

6488072,2,B00LIUIFJ4,"The story lines are good and the humorous conflict between father and son are fun but all this would have been better with just verbal references to the son's addiction to sex, instead of having so much of the good detective story interrupted by having to watch his sexual antics. There are better shows of this type out there.",1432339200,,327,4.559322033898305

6488075,5,B00LIUIFJ4,"This is a great series with excellent actors and great stories. I have the first two seasons and recently purchased 3 through 5. It is filmed in Newfoundland in the city of St. Johns and has some very nice scenery. The town itself is very quaint. I have a negative comment that in no way relates to the quality the show but it does relate to the fact that seasons 4 and 5 are listed with English subtitles but they actually only have English closed captioning which is not the same thing. Closed caption does not work over an HDMI connection. You have to use a composite connection from the DVD player to the TV or an RF connection if those are still around. Fortunately the dialogue is very clear so I can make out what is said pretty well without CC or subtitles. Just to let everyone know that subtitles are not available on these seasons. Otherwise it is a show well worth watching. Funny and somewhat reminiscent of the old American private eye shows like Magnum, The Rockford files etc.",1425513600,2,992,4.456043956043956
6488076,5,B00LIUIFJ4,Absolutely love it !!! Can't wait for Season 6 (and sadly the last) to become available.,1425254400,,88,4.5625
6488077,5,B00LIUIFJ4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this tv series from Canada. I first watched Murdoch Mysteries, all the seasons, and looked for something like it. There is a little comedy and romance added into the action of this detective series. I am sad that it is ended. Some of the characters from Murdoch acted in a few episodes which was fun.",1422403200,,321,4.551724137931035
6488078,2,B00LIUIFJ4,"You'd better not start a drinking game with the number of times Jake is hit in the head with a blunt object, how many times the bad guy sneaks up on him, or how many times he gets arrested despite preventing or solving a slew of crimes for the police.  After all these seasons, Des is still a babbling fool when he's remotely nervous, and the introduction of Sloan is a complete waste of time.  I want to see what happens because I do like the characters for the most part, but the writing is phoned in and over the top.",1421625600,,520,4.138613861386139

Great gift for anyone who is from Newfoundland & Labrador but is living off the island.",1416787200,,193,4.243243243243243
6488088,1,B00LIUIFJ4,"Missing 20 minutes in the last episode on the first disc due to damage. The disc was unattached from the clip (broken). I'm fairly sure the seller knew it was broken when sent (just shake it).  Kept only because I could still keep up with the story (and the price).  However, I will never purchase from this seller again.",1416528000,,321,4.423728813559322
