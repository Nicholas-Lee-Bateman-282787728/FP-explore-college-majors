8352387,5,B0026A2QEA,"every few years, a new horror director bursts on the scene with a vision so new, so brilliant, that he sets the bar for those who come after.

this year's model is randall kaplan, who has taken a budget of zero and created work that is both disturbing and artistic.  dark but enlightened.  films that live with you long after the bluray has stopped.

check out his visual mastery.  his ability to tell a story with only images.

check out his ability to use music to sometimes accentuate, sometimes juxtapose.  he not only wrote the films, he composed much of the music.

8352388,5,B0026A2QEA,"Randall Kaplan has made a huge leap into the world of cinema with this collection of short films that will guarantee to have you thinking well after the final end credits. The dark atmospheres Kaplan creates give the viewer a feeling of dread unlike no other as his characters go on their journeys of mental and physical breakdown.

With each short film shot in glorious Black and White we are given a norish view of Kaplan's world with it's unsettling soundtrack (composed by Kaplan) completing the task of dragging you into his head. This film is an absolute must watch. Lynch? Cronenberg? Look out for this guy, he might give you nightmares!",1245888000,2,644,4.75
8352389,5,B0026A2QEA,"For those that love Nightmares you have found what you are looking for In Mr. Kaplan""s collection of short films. This young film maker has mastered the use of Black and white film to create truly unique and nightmarish images. One scene in ""Boxhead"" of two parents arguing and joined by a piece of flesh is as effective as it is unique to film. I can only hope Mr. Kaplan continues to make his own films and does not get side lined into a film editing job, which he also is good at: A rare combination in one individual.",1245801600,,521,4.2727272727272725
