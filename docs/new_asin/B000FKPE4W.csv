2570616,1,B000FKPE4W,"I bought this title after reading a few decent reviews of it here, but it was a total waste of money. I was hoping GaoGaiGar would be similar to Godannar, a recent, terrific robot fighting anime that has similar-looking people (due to having the same character designer). But the two shows are completely different. The directing for GaoGaiGar is awful, the music ranges from bad to downright annoying, and the show has no plot. It's just a 50-episode long ""working"" show where the same repetitive thing happens over and over with every episode.

GaoGaiGar feels like a cheesy robot anime that might have been made in the mid 70's. However it was actually produced in 1997, so it's recent enough that no excuses can be given for the poor way in which it was made.",1162512000,,763,4.651851851851852

2570619,5,B000FKPE4W,"There is a slight misprint on the title there, this is GAOGAIGAR: KING OF THE BRAVES vol 1, WITH COLLECTOR'S BOX.  That would be why the SRP is listed as 34.95 up above.  If you want volume one without the box, check amazon for the 29.95 SRP version!

Hail to the King!",1157500800,4,269,4.134615384615385
2570620,5,B000FKPE4W,"Gaogaigar is a fine piece of mech anime, driving away from Evangelions dark overtones, it brought people back into the old school mecha action, while still keeping a dark, yet hopeful storyline. The theme songs very addicting, the mechs are original and unique while still keeping some old school features. And the characters are very likeable, making this a very well thought out series. Now hopefully these DVDs will be equally as successful making this a fine additions to anyones mecha anime collection. We can only hope.",1148342400,7,525,5.045977011494253
8124256,1,B000FKPE4W,"Love the show. Dislike to an exceptionally strong degree the seller.

TECHNICALLY, the listing information is correct: I bought Gaigaigar - King of Braves w/ Collector's Box. That said, the inclusion of the words ""Collector's Box"" to MOST of the buying community indicate a full box-set. This purchase is my mistake: I should have read the fine lines, and I was clearly (in hindsight) being a novice buyer. But this seller is also at fault for putting the sale in what can, at passing glance or to the untrained eye, be misleading language.

DO NOT buy from this seller. He seeks only your money, for quite literally a FRACTION of the product you think you're getting.",1499817600,,668,4.75
8124257,5,B000FKPE4W,"Didn't expected so many 1 star review for this review, as an (old) super fan who watched this series in 1999/2000, I felt I can give little more perspective on this animation:

1. The common understanding for Brave / Ysha series - The intension was for selling toy, by Takara
2. Target audience were pre high school kids
3. From my experience watching japanese animation from late 80s to early 00s -  Japanese TV animation with 49 episodes were usually relatively low quality, with a lot repetitive plot / scene

Without these in mind, those 1 star review were indeed valid.

Basic format of this show is homage to 70s classic super robot show, every week there are new monster, and the hero defect it. Producer were well aware of this format, and adding some twist to it (at least for first 20 episode), such as:

A. The transformation process could be disturb
B. Enemy were aware protagonist action/weapons, and proposed counter strategy on it

Now those were small twist only, the basic format stayed the same, but if you watched enough super robot animation, those twist will certainly put a smile on you.

And the level of excitement in the second half of the show just went through the roof.

Take away point:

1. If you never watch old school 80s/90s 49 episode jap tv robot animation, or all the Japanese animation you watched were OVA, or TV classic such as Evangelion, you may not like this series
2. but If you like super robot animation and would like to give it a shot - start in Episode 29 - this is where the first boss fight concluded the first half started.",1465430400,,1574,4.53356890459364
8124258,1,B000FKPE4W,"I purchased this with the FULL intent on having not one but FIVE DVD's in this ""boxed set"", as did the Yellow boxed set.

However this would NOT be the case as only ONE DVD came packaged in this thing (there was a cardboard filler to take up space in what SHOULD have been the remaining FOUR DVD cases that're supposed to be in this box.

WTH?!?!

 I only got Disc #1(episodes 1-5 the NEXT group in the yellow box picks up w/Disc 6 episodes 26-30 (in case you may've been wondering) so WHERE is Disc 2 (episodes 7-10), Disc 3 (episodes 11-15), Disc 4 (episodes 16-20, and Disc 5 (episodes 21-25)? NOWHERE to be found...that's where. So folks don't expect to get what you THINK you're supposed to be getting when you pay for this particular item.

I feel like I've been Gipped here folks. Now not ONLY must I search for the remaining four DVD's with the episodes that're missing to complete this set I have to PAY extra to get them.

SUCKS...SUCKS...SUCKS!!!!",1421452800,3,958,4.445714285714286
8124259,5,B000FKPE4W,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon, I got at a store called 2nd & Charles and was surprised to find this. It was used and for a great price, but when I checked out, they only had one of the DVD boxes opened and the rest still have the plastic cover. Clearly they didn't enjoy it, but it's their lost. I love the series, but I really love the old mecha shows unlike some who like the newer ones. This I believe was the star of the Yuusha series, it's a really good show. Although a few of the reviews said that they didn't like it and was a waste of money.

Now, you can switch between English subbed or English dubbed, which I prefer the subbed because I've watched the show subbed and I don't like the dubbed that much. Now, as I was watching this, the subbed had Guy's name spelled out as ""Gai"", but I do have a old DVD player and it could be doing that.

I regret nothing buying this and a must have for GaoGaiGar/Yuusha fans. 5 outta 5 I give this review.",1377216000,2,959,4.068783068783069
8124260,5,B000FKPE4W,"This show is a throwback to the halcyon days of giant robot shows.  It is rather formulaic - most episodes follow the formula of setup-giant monster-giant robot fight.  Don't let that fool you into thinking the show is generic or bad, though.  The hero, Guy, is cast in the mold of the true hero (much like Kamina in the more recent Gurren Lagann).  There's none of the angst that plagues most giant robot shows, and while the plot is a little slow, it more than makes up for it with the action.  Later episodes also include additional giant robot allies (the idea of a robot that is also a ninja is at once ridiculous and awesome).

If you want a show that mimics older robot shows, with completely over the top characters who are courageous and kick butt, this is a series for you.",1215820800,,783,4.402777777777778
8124261,1,B000FKPE4W,"I'm going to make this short and sweet: I couldn't get past the 3rd episode. I'm told the series picks up later on, but  that's a terrible disclaimer and I'd advise anyone against wasting an hour and a half of mediocrity in order to possibly reach something worthwhile. The first 2 episodes end literally the exact same way and the 3rd is only slightly different, so much time is wasted with recycled animation, the characters are 2-D, the designs are rather stock, and the sound editing is terrible; non-dynamic with start/stop music.

Even if this is meant for little kids, they deserve much better. If you're looking for a melodramatic, exciting, super robot anime nostalgia, the values this series  has been attributed, buy Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann; Don't waste your time and money here.",1203552000,,793,4.902985074626866
8124262,5,B000FKPE4W,"GaoGaiGar is a series that fans of Super Robot should own. Not only is it a fun series, it pays homage to classic super robot shows. This series isn't well known but it's well known to the mecha/super robot fans on the internet. The characters are great and very likable. The first half of the show is good. The second half is amazing from what I hear. Id say if your fan of Super Robot or want to get into the genre, id say check this one out. There are some reviews on here that are pretty negative, but this show always isn't a hit for everyone. Also it's by Sunrise, so when you hear the OP song, it will get stuck in your head for days.",1186185600,2,641,4.05511811023622
8124263,5,B000FKPE4W,The people that have been complaining about GaoGaiGar are idoits and all they want to see is Robot Anime with no plot and episodes dedicated to fanservice and ridiculously giant boobs!!!  GaoGaiGar is a True Super Robot Anime!!!  Theres no way you can pass this up if you Love Awesome Robots!!!,1173830400,,294,4.745098039215686
8124264,4,B000FKPE4W,"Throughout the 90s the venerable ""Super Robot"" genre of anime had entered something of a decline. While this had lead to some interesting deconstructions of the genre such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Giant Robo, more traditional entries in the field suffered. A throwback to the kinds television programs which gave Americans the Shogun Warriors toy line and Voltron, GaoGaoGar is simple and unpretentious: it's a program about a cool looking robot having fight scenes with bizarre monsters.

While competing shows in the genre were unsuccessfully trying to shovel nihilistic themes onto a children's genre (*cough, cough* Getta Robo Armageddon) GaoGaiGar applied a back-to-the basics formula, mixing in well staged fight scenes with an over-the-top approach to weapon and mecha design which was later imitated by Gear Fighter Dendo, Gravion, and Goddanar. Though the plots are relatively simplistic, they carry an interesting underlying theme of corruption and redemption. The ""Zondar"" monsters which GGG fights are kaiju-sized embodiments of human vices, frustrations, and failings taken from innocent victims.

GaoGaiGar holds an interesting place in the history of the super robot genre because it marks both the end of the Takara's long-running ""Brave"" series of mecha shows, and the beginning of modern Super Robots. Though it's animation lacks polish the show's eclectic cast of characters, immense fight scenes, and completely over-the-top mentality make GGG a crowd pleasure. Die-hard fans of the Super Robot genre, or anyone giving a serious look to anime history of the mid-to-late 90s should give the show a look.

Fans of the horror anime-series Betterman may also want to give the show a passing glance as it takes place in the same continuity according to both series producer Sunrise's Studio 7, though aside from a few winks and nods in the latter GaoGaiGar Final OVA we don't see an official crossover between the shows.",1163635200,10,1942,5.339869281045751
8124265,1,B000FKPE4W,"GaoGaiGar was advertised as a giant robot show made by fans of giant robot shows. If that were true it should have been more like Godannar, Gravion, New Getter Robo, Dai-Guard or Kirameki Project. Instead it's simplistic, repetitive and seem to have been made to sell toys to seven year olds. It's like Voltron, only dumber. If you're under ten you might enjoy it, but if you like old-school robots, stay away from this one.",1163376000,,424,4.666666666666667
