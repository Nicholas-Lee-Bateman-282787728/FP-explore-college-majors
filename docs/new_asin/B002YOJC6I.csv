8384325,5,B002YOJC6I,"We all get used to fine music making from this team - but this is one of the best. This was the final concert that Abbado gave with this orchestra as the chief conductor and the affection that the orchestra and Abbado shared with each other is quite evident throughout and the orchestra clearly rise to this very special occasion. The venue for this concert was Palermo in Sicily so to some extent Abbado is playing to the home crowd and they love it with copious flowers raining down from the boxes and balconies at the end.

The Brahms violin concerto with Gil Shaham has come to be regarded as outstanding in a crowded market and is well able to be compared favourably with the best. A good forward momentum is maintained without any feeling of undue hurry. The playing of Shaham and the orchestra is fully sensitive to every nuance but this is done without undue expressive heaviness.

The Dvorak has the tremendous drive and spontaneity that you can get at some live concerts. As with the Brahms, there is a good forward momentum maintained but combined with sensitive playing from the orchestra and the soloists within the orchestra. This is a very exciting `live' experience.

The Verdi Overture encore maintains this excitement and this becomes to be a thrilling end to a particularly memorable event.

The whole concert is in good sound and with sympathetic camera work. The recording was made in 2002 and with genuine HD recording equipment. The producer, Paul Smaczny, had started using HD recording equipment since about 2000 and this results in crisp imaging and wide ranging sound presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. (Another example of genuine HD recording and dating from 2000 is the Wagner Ring as conceived and conducted by Maazel).

This recording has achieved considerable recognition as a special event over the intervening years. The DVD was a notable success but the Blu-ray edition adds significantly to that. Both options provide a deeply satisfying musical experience which should give purchasers equivalent pleasure. It seems totally reasonable to recommend this disc as being worth a full 5 stars therefore in either format.",1344902400,4,2149,4.941828254847645
8384326,4,B002YOJC6I,"Remember the opening scene in Disney's ""Aladdin""?  A slimy-looking Arab character looks at us, the audience, and  furtively urges us to ""come closer"".  The perspective them zooms rapidly in so his unshaven face occupies most of the screen as if ""we"" had closed in.  The Arab looks startled and says, ""Not so close! Not so close!""
That's what we experience during this Brahms Violin Concerto with the fine soloist Gil Shaham, from whom I would prefer the camera took a more distant perspective.  Shaham perspires so profusely from his face and even the tips of his ear and nose that his violin is drenched.  We even get to watch the subsequent deluge of perspiration running off the violin onto the stage.  The vivid visual date competed directly with the fine musical experience.  You, dear reader, know if you want to see this.
You have the option of looking away from the screen for the concerto, for there is not need to do so for the rest of the program.  All performances are excellent; nothing phoned in here.  Sound is good, but not CD quality.
The concert hall in Palermo is beautiful.  The picture quality is NOT high def, but good enough if your screen is not very large.
Haven't seen the blu-ray version, but one reviewer found it inadequate compared to the potential of blu-ray.",1309824000,2,1290,4.688888888888889
