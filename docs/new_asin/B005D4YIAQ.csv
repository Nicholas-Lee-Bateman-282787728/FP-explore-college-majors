8466294,4,B005D4YIAQ,"I Just finished watching this dvd for the first time. I won't lie to you and tell you the video is up to modern standards. As a matter of fact, it can to some extent, be broken down into two parts-the first 40% approx. and the last 60%. Now if I had to describe the video in a poor/acceptable/good/very good range, I would say that the first 40% is acceptable(-) at times very grainy and the last 60% is good(-) somewhat less grainy and the focus is better. I say this first since I'm sure that the average person will be slightly disappointed in the video and I think a fan or not, one should be forewarned. Now that I've got that out of the way, where to begin on the positive? I'll start will the audio. That is much better than the video! The disc I bought is not a region free disc, so I couldn't watch in my surround sound system. I had to watch it on my region free dvd player and my soundbar. It sounded very good consistently though! Another positive thing that I enjoyed very much as well was the Interview of the band in the extra. I watched that first and found it to be very entertaining; quite a bit of fun, especially the drummer and the beginning where they (a member of the band) received a phone call out of the blue from Greg Walker inquiring whether they'd be interested in performing in LA. It is just too amazing to believe that they hadn't played together at that time for almost a decade! What an f***in' mind trip that must have been for them! I, myself as a fan of Solaris and having only discovered them in 2012 or so, would like to extend my gratitude to Greg Walker for his efforts in resurrecting this band and giving them the opportunity to notice the fan base and subsequently producing the latter works in the repertoire. Thank you, Greg! Also, if anyone is interested, Greg is the proprietor of the recorded music outlet - Syn-phonic Music. A great symphonic music outlet, not to mention that he's very fair in his pricing and a nice guy. Next time you're looking for something, give S-P M a try. Back to the dvd. I would say that it falls in the category between 3 and 4 stars, if you don't like the band or their symphonic music much, you probably would drop to 3 stars, but because I like their music quite a bit, I will have it just squeak by to the 4 star position -even with the video issues. I am so looking forward to hearing Nostradamus Book of Prophecies, Martian Chronicle II and 1990 which I have on order from Greg as I write this critique! I'll end this by saying that if perfect video is a must, stay away from this dvd! It is grainy throughout, but better in the last 60%. As some of the only stuff by Solaris on dvd and if you might be considering purchasing this sometime, especially if you like their music, I would say pick it up and enjoy an imperfect dvd by a not perfect band-come on we all know what they said at Sunday school-though I got it first hand in perochial school from some of the original antique seeking nuns! Thanks, take care and enjoy God's gift of music!",1442793600,,3028,4.267826086956521
