8142080,5,B000HXDHR8,"I bought this along with ""My Fleeting House"". They are definitely companion DVDs. If you love Tim Buckley's music, ""My Fleeting House"" has all of his filmed live performances. If you are just interested in Tim Buckley's life, this one is the one to get. But if you are like most TB fans, you'll want/need both.",1344816000,,310,4.553571428571429
8142081,3,B000HXDHR8,"This is a pretty good overview of TB's work, and a nice companion to the ""Fleeting House"" DVD.  Good to see a few more talking heads added to the three in ""Fleeting House"" that worked with TB (Jerry Yester and Buddy Helm) and two that have a little more objectivity (a couple of rock journalists from Rolling Stone and allmusic).

My main gripe is some misinformation in the form of the ""Song of the Siren"" being played in the context of the ""Starsailor"" LP is actually from the ""Works on Progress"" recorded a couple of years before, more akin to the Monkees TV version. If you haven't heard the ""Starsailor"" LP version, this won't make any contextual sense based on the onscreen discussion.

Also, I like the interactive quiz extra, but find it hilarious that the question asking for the state where TB did his last show gives among its answers ""Dallas"" and ""Texas"", and ""Dallas"" is the right answer. I guess this is based on the TV show ""Dallas"" being big in the UK. Texas is the state where Dallas is located, yew non-Marcans...

This is a nice item, though, based on the relative dearth of TB product.  Hopefully, between the Folklore Center CD, ""Fleeting House"" DVD, and the recent release of half of the lost 1967 single on the ""Where the Action Is"" set, some more TB will be unearthed.

Beware, though, the TB Archives people on the Internet think this DVD is illegal:

2006 - Tim Buckley - Review And Critique Of The Man And His Music,
Chrome Dreams (UK)

Unauthorized review of Tim Buckley's career, with contemporary interviews paired with poor-quality, multi-generational sources.

After failure by the production company to secure mechanical rights from the publishers, it is illegal to sell this DVD in the USA.",1255737600,3,1724,4.72
8142082,4,B000HXDHR8,"Insightful overview of the life and music of the late, great Tim Buckley.  The most interesting bits are the interviews with Buckley's friend and songwriting partner Larry Beckett, long-time guitarist Lee Underwood, and producer Jerry Yester.  With personal vignettes and stories, the three of them paint a graphic picture of Buckley the musician and the often tortured process that led to his haunting and unique musical creations.  Buckley biographer David Browne does an excellent job rounding out details of Buckley's life and loves, while rock critics Anthony DeCurtis and Richie Unterberger put the course of Buckley's musical career in perspective and explain the ultimately futile attempt by Buckley's record label to steer him toward a more commercial sound.  The interviews are interspersed with photos and video clips of performances.  And here the only real gripe about the DVD: The video clips are generally only short, 15-20 second segments.  Perhaps there was a problem obtaining the rights, but even three or four complete clips would have given the viewer a much better feel for Buckley as a performer.  I was lucky enough to see him live a few years before he died.  His stage presence was electrifying.  I'll never forget his extended rip through Gypsy Woman, wailing and moaning like a man posessed.  Tim Buckley was a talent like nothing ever before or since.  A must for Buckley fans.",1169424000,9,1406,5.12280701754386
