7797075,5,1569388938,"Had purchased Hitler's Bodyguard from Amazon and had seen Hitler's Bodyguard series on the History channel.  There were references to Hitler's Bodyguard being from the producers of Churchill's Bodyguard on both the History Channel and the DVD set I purchased.  I went to Amazon and checked to see if Churchill's Bodyguard was available - it was and at a fantastic price.  I ordered the set, received it in three days and watched it over the next several nights.  The series was fascinating, learned so much from watching the series and gained a new appreciation for what Churchill and his Bodyguard endured over their many years together.  Highly recommend the set to any one interested in World War II and modern English history.",1378080000,,730,4.950819672131147
