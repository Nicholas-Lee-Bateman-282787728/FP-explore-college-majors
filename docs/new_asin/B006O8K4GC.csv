8501638,5,B006O8K4GC,"Happy birthday Daniel Barenboim, born this day, Nov. 15, 1942.  One of the greatest living pianists, also one of the great orchestral conductors in the world today.

And one who bravely does the right thing, becoming involved in politics to help bring peace to the world, even though many do not approve.

Some others may not appreciate it, but I appreciate it.  Bravo on all counts, Mr. Barenboim!",1510704000,,398,4.8088235294117645

8501643,4,B006O8K4GC,"I must confess I only bought this because there was nothing else new to buy. Why is there so little orchestral repertoire being released. Is nobody buying this stuff?

I haven't deliberately listened to these Lizst concerti for decades (just on the radio in the car). After watching this disc, I remember why! I do like Lizst, but either in solo piano or purely orchestral. These concertos have some good moments, but basically they are for pianists who enjoy this kind of bombast.

Barenboim has apparently set his mind on recording everything ever written by everybody, whether piano, orchestra or both! Let me say, I am an admirer of his, for example, his Elgar/Brahms disc with the BPO or his terrific Mahler 9. But I just wonder when you put out so much stuff, how much of it can be excellent?  There are rumors of the last six Bruckner symphonies, all done within a week, being readied for release, with this Berlin Staatskapelle. I suppose I shouldn't complain, with so little coming out from anybody else.

The video and audio are beyond reproach, and Boulez conducts this in his usual unencumbered style. It's probably why he still looks so good at 85. I love this guy, too. Just not in this repertoire.

Additionally, we are treated to two solo Lizst pieces, which I enjoyed, and two Wagner pieces, which I didn't. The Wagner ""Faust"", a real piece of frippery, and Siegfried Idyll (I have enjoyed this piece, just not in this context).

So, buy it for the sound and video, and to watch Barenboim beat the hell out of the piano. Or, wait for something more enticing to make its appearance!",1331164800,11,1598,4.669039145907473
8501644,5,B006O8K4GC,"A strange program selection indeed: there is Wagner's fairly unmemorable ""Faust"" overture, flanking Liszt's flamboyant 2nd piano concerto with the intimate (but arguably misplaced) Siegfried Idyll, followed by the heroic 1st piano concerto and a couple of (most welcome) encores. A major intent of this production was obviously to showcase Daniel Barenboim's undisputable mastery of these technically demanding, at their time revolutionary, but musically not always satisfying bravura pieces. The concert was recorded live in June 2011 in Essen in the excellent sound and video one has come to expect from Accentus. The Berlin Staatskapelle under Pierre Boulez performs marvelously, Boulez his stoic self with minimalist gestures, but always on top of this repertoire which might not be overly close to his own heart. First Concert Master Wolf-Dieter Batzdorf offers many an encouraging smile during the proceedings, and the important solo parts of all musicians - including the triangle - are beautifully highlighted. As to Barenboim's approach to the concertos, he wrings every last thundering ounce of glittering virtuosity from the scores and, at the same time, pays full attention to the many lyrical passages. He appears to be enjoying himself despite the exertion, but I can not sense an expression of love for the music which so often radiates from his performances (for example his recent DVD recordings of the Chopin concertos or Mahler 9: see my reviews). Boulez, too, seems rather unmoved by these pieces, though he is the more difficult to read. In sum: these are exceedingly brilliant, but cool performances, perhaps inadvertently revealing a certain lack of substance beneath the music's surface. Regardless, it is good to have these concertos on DVD. I'm looking forward to re-viewing them: I may yet change my opinion and I'll let you know.",1330819200,14,1857,5.341296928327645
