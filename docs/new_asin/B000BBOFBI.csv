2410592,1,B000BBOFBI,"Detective (David Cass, 2005)

Detective is based on an Arthur Hailey novel, which should tell you all you need to know. If you're not familiar with Arthur Hailey, he was a writer of potboilers back in the day, probably best-remembered these days for writing the novel on which the original Airport was based, the film which started the glut of seventies disaster films. Which, if you're of the I suspect most of you are, you also don't remember. In any case, Hailey;s books are quite forgettable. As is this movie--so much so, in fact, that I started writing this review ten minutes before the movie was over; I knew if I let it go, I'd forget the movie entirely.

The detective of the title is Martin Ainsley (Tom Berenger), a former priest turned cop who's investigating a series of murders after the killer topped a councilman and his wife. Ainsley's having problems with his wife (Cybill Shepherd), in no small part because the daughter (Annabeth Gish) of said murdered councilman has been getting uncomfortably close to Ainsley. Problem is, once they get the guy, he confesses to all the murders except councilman etc. Which sets up the big twist ending you can see coming from a mile away.

Cass, better known as an actor (Tron) and stuntman (Tequila Sunrise) than a director, got beind the camera in the late nineties and started cranking out junk like this at an alarming rate. Well, I guess there's a market for it, as evidenced by the talent they got to appear in it. Still, actors are only as good as the material you give them, and this by-the-numbers mystery is as vapid and predictable as they come. If you're the kind of person who's surprised by the end of Jodi Picoult novels and Lifetime Original Movies, you may find some suspense to be had here. Otherwise, steer clear. *",1242950400,2,1791,4.6613924050632916
2410593,5,B000BBOFBI,The plot is well-developed to keep you stay still with the screen so that you cannot miss any scene. A good movie that deserves to be owned and kept in your priceless collection.,1171152000,5,178,4.424242424242424
2410594,3,B000BBOFBI,"Although based on Arthur Hailey's bestseller, DETECTIVE doesn't live up to its pedigree.

The story gets muddled at times; a former priest turned detective is assigned to track down a serial killer who kills elderly couples in some sort of religious frenzy.  His partner and lover is the Councilman's daughter, and the cop himself is estranged from his wife and son.  Their personal crises intermingle with the murder plot, and although you will maintain your interest, it's a little long in the tooth with only average performances.

Tom Berenger as the detective gives a relatively dispassionate performance; Annabeth Gish phones in her partner performance' Cybill Shepherd as the wife gives the most effective performance but she's not in the movie much.  Charles Durning and Sean O'Bryan round out the cast.  This could have been much better with a shorter script and more impassioned performances from its leads.",1169856000,7,917,5.204081632653061
2410595,5,B000BBOFBI,"Tom Berenger's newest release, ""Detective"" is an engrossing but long movie with excellent character development, exciting episodes, and a very good and emotional secondary theme with Tom's usual stellar performance.  I really recommend this DVD.  It is taken from a series (I believe) but well-directed and edited.  I especially admired the performance by Sybil Shepard as the detective's ex-wife who loves him deeply.  Their scenes with the counselor are especially effective and ring true. You will watch this one over and over again - I did - mainly, for me anyway, because Tom is in almost every scene and who can't love that - plus it is great entertainment all the way!",1135987200,15,675,5.0
2410596,5,B000BBOFBI,"Came upon this movie quite by chance when surfing Amazon.com.  It arrived yesterday.  Just finished watching it.  Even though it is approx 3 hours in length, it kept us spellbound right to the very end.  This movie is proof that one can have an interesting mystery without all the foul language.  Hightly recommend this one.",1135296000,27,324,4.818181818181818

2410603,1,B000BBOFBI,"Don't buy this movie, don't rent this movie, don't even think about this movie; I'm sure Tom Berenger has put it out of his memory. Some screen writer took a decent Arthur Hailey novel, Detective, and for some unknown reason changed the best and most important parts of the story line, and turned it into a mundane, meandering and unrealistic bore. It was a waste of time, effort and energy to make this mistake and my error to view such. After nearly three hours of an inane story I'm convinced actors don't make a movie, the writing does. Although it appears Berenger, Annabeth Gish, Cybil Shepherd et al. are calling it in, no actor  Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron  could salvage this train wreck. If you insist on viewing this made-for-bad TV flick, you can have my copy. Oh, I'm sorry, I've already thrown it away.",1393113600,,832,4.653061224489796

8084461,1,B000BBOFBI,"We watched this, and  basically it was not worth anything. Music in the background made it hard to hear what the actors were saying. I do not recommend it by any means, certainly did not care for it. As far as I know, it was the director's or producers fault. Buy at your own risk.",1439251200,2,281,4.109090909090909
