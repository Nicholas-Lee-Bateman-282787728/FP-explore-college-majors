7417281,5,B014LLFHYM,"US release to come in the Fall of this must see documentary based on Truffauts 1966 book
As I post this in early August 2016, the original version of this wonderful documentary has not been given a home video release date yet. It should be in September or October. It is- however  being shown in the US on HBO beginning August 8th. The current listing on Amazon is of the FRENCH VERSION of this film and does not have English subtitles, so even though it would play on region-free players, if you live in the US, you wouldnt understand it.  The film was produced by Charles S. Cohen (whose Cohen Media Group has restored and released many great film classics), it will probably get a classier release in the US and will be worth waiting for (after youve seen on HBO).

Written and Directed by Kent Jones, the 80 minute film (narrated by actor Bob Balaban) is based on the landmark paperback book of the same name published in 1966 (and later revised before Truffauts death just a few years after Hitchcocks passing), the film uses the original audio tapes of the week-long conversation that Truffaut had with Hitchcock in 1962. It was not filmed but legendary photographer Phillipe Halsman captured the event in black and white still photos that Jones uses to match the audio. He also includes many film clips of both Hitchcocks and Truffauts films.
 Most are identified but I found it frustrating that some werent. (Not a big deal; just annoying). There are many current interviews comments by famous directors like Martin Scorsese (who says he loves Vertigo  and watches it repeatedly  though he thinks the story is weak), Wes Anderson, David Fincher and Peter Bogdanovich. The two Hitch films that get the most attention are Vertigo and Psycho. But, if you are link me, youll find yourself searching for other films to re-watch after hearing Hitchcock talk about them here.

So, if you are in the US, be patient. Watch the documentary on HBO if you subscribe to that channel and then wait for Cohens release in the US this fall.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

You can play it on your computer, though (with the caveat that you're likely only able to change your computer's DVD zone setting a limited number of times). And everything is in French. Even the English interviews are dubbed over. There is no English track. There are no English subtitles. Only Hitch himself isn't overdubbed, but he's actually not in the film all that much.

If this were a Zone 1 American version, with English subtitles for the French and no overdubbing of French over the English, I give it five stars. This is a movie about Hitchcock and the amazing book, Hitchcock/Truffaut. It is not a DVD version of the book, alas. It has some highlights, but that's all. Still, it's fun to see the old film footage, behind the scenes stills, etc.

The best thing to do is to buy the book. It's back in print. Anyone who loves movies will have a new world opened.",1452211200,10,999,4.483516483516484
7417284,4,B014LLFHYM,"""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" (2015 release; 80 min.) is a documentary based on the book of the same name, originally published in 1966. The book was essentially a transcript of a weeklong interview/conversation between directors Alfred Hitchcock and Francois Truffaut. As the movie opens, we are given a quick historical context within which these conversations took place, and the various contemporaries (Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, David Lynch, etc.) provide their further perspectives. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are a movie aficionado, you are in for a finger-lickin' good time, as two of the giants in movie history dissect Hitchcock's oeuvre in a manner that we have not seen before, and along the way we also get a fresh and better understanding of Truffaut's oeuvre. But let's be clear: this documentary is mostly about Hitchcock, and at times it feels that the book simply serves as an excuse to examine Hitchcock. But we admittedly also get a clear understanding as to why the book was much more than just a book for Truffaut and that it was as important as any film he made. While Hitchcock's entire career is looked at (including the very early days), the documentary spends more time on two Hitchcock films than any other: Vertigo and Psycho. We also get a clear understanding why Hitchcock claimed that ""all actors are cattle"", which makes the director of this documentary (the to me previously unknown Kent Jones) wonder how outspoken/strong-willed icons like Robert de Niro, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman would have fared under Hitchcock. One of the best features of the documentary is that the audio tapes of the week-long conversation between Hitchcock and Truffaut have survived and are used heavily (along with still photographs from those sessions). It's like we're having a seat at the table along with these movie giants and the interpreter. I only wished that the movie lasted longer than its all-too-brief 80 min. running time.

""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" opened this weekend without any fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I figured this will not be playing very long, so I went to see it right away. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Given the lack of any marketing for the movie, this didn't come as a surprise. That said, if you love movies and want to get new insights on Hitchcock and Truffaut, you simply cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Hitchcock/Truffaut"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1450483200,10,2673,5.031602708803612
7417285,5,B014LLFHYM,"Astonishing.

The basic theme is a week long interview by Truffaut of Hitchcock, which led to Truffaut's iconic book about Hitchcock's work:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitchcock-A-Definitive-Study-of-Alfred-Hitchcock/dp/B0182L0CNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitchcock: A Definitive Study of Alfred Hitchcock</a>, a book anyone serious about understanding movies really must read at least once.

I have this video on order. We saw it last night at the Film Forum, and the reviews were incredibly strong. They are all well deserved.

One mild negative: there wasn't as much analysis by Truffaut as I would have liked, especially since Truffaut gives so much credit to Hitchcock; at an award ceremony, for example: ""In Hollywood you call him 'Hitch'; in France we call him 'Monsieur Hitchcock.""

Instead, there are a number of interviews with leading directors, particularly Americans and particularly Scorsese. Many of these comments were very enlightening, especially good on ""Vertigo"" we thought. An interesting question: the movie is told through Scottie's eyes -- would it have been as effective seen through Madeleine /Judy's eyes. Interesting speculation and Scorsese concludes that Hitchcock chose Scottie, Hitchcock's alter ego.

One of the great strengths of the film are the carefully chosen extracts from over a dozen of Hitchcock's films, from the very earliest to the last released at the time of the interview -- there would be only two more.

And, at the end, and even more fascinating question, one that Hitchcock apparently struggled with throughout his professional life: was he a ""serious"" film maker, or just an entertainer?

Superb documentary; I will review the video itself once I can find a copy. But in the meantime, if you love film as an art form, seek out this fine production.

7417328,4,B014LLFHYM,"Any review of this book would have to start out by emphasizing the very important point that this documentary is, per se, not much about the actual book that the title implies (Hitchcock/Trauffaut, based on Trauffaut's interview of Hitchcock). In that book Trauffaut did an excellent job at getting at the heart of Hitchcock's ""style"" of filmmaking. After reading that book one gets an excellent feel for Hitchcock's technique and would learn much about filmmaking technique as well as filmmaking as an art form. This DVD barely even touches upon this.

What it does touch upon is the relationship between the two men (both at the time of the interview as well as through the many years afterwards) as well as to the meeting itself between these two men for that book. At the time of the interview Hitchcock was already well passed his prime while Trauffaut was just starting to bloom. From the time of the interview to the end of his life, roughly 13 years later, Hitchcock only made 3 more films. Trauffaut, on the other hand, would make a film per year (in a few years more). Before that he had only made 3 films. Despite this both men had a deep appreciation and affinity for each other's works and Trauffaut considered considered Hitchcock's influence to both his ""style"" of filmaking as well as to the art of the cinema. Hitchcock, on the other hand, was very much enamored by Trauffaut's style. This is why both men had a correspondence via letters (in French - Hitchcock was fluent in French) both before the interview and until the end of his life. This is why Trauffaut wanted to in interview Hitchcock and why Hitchcock agreed, despite the great disparity in each other's stature at the time. Their relationship was very close until Hitchcock's death. The documentary is primarily about this relationship and friendship.

The interview itself and its resulting book, is only of secondary importance in the documentary. Little is said in the documentary about Hitchcock's ""style"" of filmmaking which is quite disappointing. However, thanks to many  interviews with many current leading filmmakers (the list includes Martin Scorcese, Wes Anderson, David Fincher, Olivier Assayas, Peter Bogdanovich, Arnaud Desplechin, James Gray, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Richard Linklater, Paul Schrader, among others) the influence of this particular book becomes very apparent. The book played a very influential role on filmmakers.",1485043200,,2420,5.075376884422111

Hitchcock was indeed an interesting film-maker well Worth investigating but any serious such investigation would have to be at least 3 or 4 hours long, because that is how inflluential  he has truly been.

7417334,3,B014LLFHYM,"If ever I could say the book was better than the film, I would say it here. The book is an incredible document of critical analysis and dialogue, resurrecting Hitchcock from being classed as a mere entertainer to a director of auteur  status, by one of the best of the new wave directors, Truffaut. The younger man pays homage as one of Cahier du Cinemas leading practitioners. The book is lavishly illustrated with many scenes from each of the films and Hitchcock is surprisingly open about his methods, his passion for pure cinema, and his use of suspense. Here, there is a no. of American directors-Anderson, Scorsese, Bogdanovitch, Fincher, Schrader- who state it was a window into the world of cinema,erudite conversations into the craft of an art form. They discuss his best films being made in the 40s and 50s-Rear Window,Vertigo, The Man who knew too much, North by Northwest , Notorious. They describe how conceptually he approached film, having the whole picture already in his head before
he realises it, using storyboarding. He is seen as a theoretician of space, who is able to use film to extend, contract or stop time, in graphic, precise visualisation.

What Truffaut really identified with Hitchcock is through both their similar childhood experiences: Hitchcocks story of his experience of his father sending him to the police staion and his fear ever after of the police; Truffaut being locked up as a child and using the experience in 400 Blows. In the book Hitch is amazingly candid on getting hold of the right actors for the parts and failing when he hadnt done this. Both directors were raised as Catholics and there is an analysis of  his Catholicism colouring his films like The Wrong Man and I Confess, with the transformation of guilt. Theres also the Gods eye view as in The Birds when he pictures the birds-point-of-view as they are hovering in the sky above when the petrol station catches fire. Theres also the scene in Psycho when the detective slowly climbs the stair and the high shot from above as Perkins-dressed as his mother rushes out and stabs him. They describe Hitchcocks use of fetish objects like a key(Notorious),a rope or bag,almost as items in a dream. He got this from imbuing his sound films with the same dream-like feelings as his silent films. Characters are real but in a dream. Scorsese comments that the plots, the stories are unreal(logic is dull), but Hitch uses cinema poetry.

They particularly analyse Vertigo and Psycho. Vertigo is especially treated as contraband, known to these directors as something you had to get hold of as craftsmen: how he undresses a woman so she becomes his own creation, how he creates a woman from the image of a dead woman, borne from an extraordinary sense of loss, about desire, the director like a voyeur chasing after a dream ideal. In Psycho the framing, the flatness, the absorbtion in this womans plight, the use of misdirection, Janet Leigh servicing an expectation, the driving shots, the movement ahead. The big eyes, the steering wheel, the scary policeman, everything restrained before the big explosion. Perkins and his mother taking us down a different path. The shifting point of view, the breaking of rules, the use of techniques learned from TV. A small story that represents something larger on the horizon. No message, no great performances, the pure sensation of film. The surprise of the audience. All the while there are shots of the interview, shots of the main conversations in the book, we even get glimpses of the pages in the book. Although what the modern directors say is
intriguing, I felt the documentary was fairly light weight. What they say adds little more than we already know. The book is the real treasure.",1473984000,5,3736,4.869496855345912

8731373,3,B014LLFHYM,"I missed this documentary when it played last year (very briefly) at a local art-house theater. I wanted to love it. A college film course I took in 1974 used the first edition of Truffaut's ""bible"" as a textbook in a semester dedicated primarily to Hitchcock's films, including his extant silents but excluding the then ""Forbidden Five."" Truffaut's book remains a classic must-read for anyone who cares about Hitchcock or, for that matter, film in general.

The problem I find with this film lies in its diffuse character and lack of clear focus. On its face Mr. Jones's documentary documents a book: in itself a challenge. After some interesting morsels of how the book came to be (most of which Hitchcock fans will already know), this movie can't stay with the book. It naturally gravitates somewhat to Truffaut and his career, but mostly to Truffaut's subject, at a time when F.T., along with Chabrol, Bogdonavich, and Wood were making critics sit up and pay attention to a popular entertainer's craft and recurrent themes. Meanwhile, the movie is glossed by excerpts from interviews with contemporary directors (Asayas, Bogdonavich, Linkletter, Scorsese, Shrader, among others), who talk variously about the book's impact upon them and the influence on their work of Truffaut or Hitchcock (or both). Their comments are interesting, occasionally fascinating: again, however, there's no clear through-line among them because the movie doesn't seem to have one. The net result: If you are already a Hitchcock enthusiast, you're likely to know at least 70% of what the movie offers. If you're not already a convert to the Church of Hitch, I doubt this film would make you one. Reading Truffaut's book might; watching Hitchcock's movies certainly would. Oddly I found most of the film's bonus featuresouttakes of what Jones chose not to include, which compiles his interviewees' observations of ""Notorious"" and ""Rope""more interesting and informative than this film's final cut.

I suppose it is blasphemous to rate this documentary anything lower than five stars, but Ebert taught us to to call it as we see it. I've reported what I've seen.",1505088000,7,2141,5.131805157593123
