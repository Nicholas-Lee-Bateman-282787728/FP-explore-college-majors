8106550,5,B000E63A3O,"This is by far the greastest of all the best of thw WWF videos. The WWF back then, for some reson did not want their videos to go over a certain length which made for a lot of highlights instead of matches shown in their entirety. This video has 5 star matches and are mostly all shown in their entirety. We start out with Hulk Hogan defending his world title against the ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage in a brawl from start to finish. Then we see Pedro Morales go one on one against the Texas wildman, Terry Funk. Then a classic from 1980, Ken Patera defending his Intercontiental championship at Shea Stadium against Tony Atlas. Other matches include:

The Hart Foundation vs. The British Bulldogs

The Dream Team vs. The Iron Shiek and Nikolia Volkoff

plus, highlights of the slammy awards

all in all, i believe this would be a great collector's item for anyone who loves wrestling from the 1980's.",1168646400,,897,4.552795031055901
