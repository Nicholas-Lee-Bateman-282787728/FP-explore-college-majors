This is the first time I have ever used videos to lose weight and I hit gold when I purchased Donna.  Just like the last reviewer said, in a short period of time I have seen really great results.  I am definitely burning fat and toning at the same time.  I LOVE this video.  I have two other of Donna's videos -- ""4-day Rotation"" (which is also great) and ""30 Days to Thinner Arms and Abs,"" and this is my favorite one in the ""30 Days"" series.  The exercises are easy to learn, extremely effective and fun.  I actually enjoy using this video, especially because it works.  Be prepared to sweat, though.  Donna is serious about the workout, but if you do it at least 4 days a week, you'll get fantastic results!",1046390400,8,724,4.311111111111111

NY City Ballet WO was fairly good (for its gracefull atmosphere and to get good posture) but neither worked on my fat.
But this one worked!
I did it only 10 times in recent two weeks, and my waist became two inches smaller and my tummy is getting flat!
In addition, I feel energized (not exhausted) when I do this video so I believe I can continue doing it until I regain my best shape.
Thanks Donna for your cheerful and effective workout!",1032048000,10,595,4.36036036036036
7926597,5,B00004Y6AJ,"I have ordered 2 videos from Donna's collection (I plan to order more in the near future) this is my favorite because of the combination, you get in my opinion what I consider a full workout. Aerobics and toning, be prepared to sweat those pounds away. I tried all those fad diets but I realize that exercise is the main key to all those diets. So I needed an exercise that did not feel like hard work and most important of all something that I would enjoy doing in addition to something that I did not dread doing. Donna's video are the key.",1021248000,8,542,4.271844660194175
7926598,3,B00004Y6AJ,"I just got the video today, and it's pretty peppy, BUT the dance moves were hard to catch on.  Trust me.  Maybe because this is my first day, but I felt I was in high school again learning a routine for my dance team.  I couldn't really concentrate on working out because I was trying to get the moves down.  Who knows, maybe I'll like it once I get the moves down, but I'm already a bit discouraged that I have to spend time learning it before really exercising.",1003881600,2,463,4.168539325842697
7926599,5,B00004Y6AJ,"This is the first workout video I have viewed where I actually had fun. Once you learn the routine, you are as good as gold. I appreciate the snazzy twist Donna added to this workout.",991612800,,183,4.257142857142857
7926600,5,B00004Y6AJ,"Last year I started exercising with Donna's tape 45 days before the Tom Joyner trip to St. Thomas.  Not only did it work,  but I felt comfortable with my own body once again.  I had stopped exercising for at least 4 years; I hadn't exercised since I was pregnant with my first child and now I have three. My abs become recognizeable, and my arms had definition they never had before. The good point is that each additional 30 days continues to show more improvement.
The best part about this video is that I never get bored.  Once I learned the routine, I realized that there were little things she had always been doing that I did not have the stamina to even try.  Once I started being more precise with my movements, I noticed even better muscle tone.  With all that said,  the music selection puts soul in my step, and keeps me going.",975888000,23,838,4.367741935483871
