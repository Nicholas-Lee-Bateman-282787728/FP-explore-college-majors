5320103,2,B009DH378I,"The Crawford family live isolated and have some inbreeding issues. They are in need of new blood. Enter the Haskin family. This is the plot of a number of ""B"" slasher films, some far better than others. This one adds the subplot of a Millennium monster, one that appears every 1,000 years. It just so happens his 1,000 year period corresponds to our calendar. It is a rather huge creature with big teeth and killer tentacles.

There is nothing like combining two bad films into one. This one appeared to be designed to be campy, which it achieves in spurts but mostly sputters with stupidity. The researcher wore a ""Crocodile Hunter"" hat and mimicked him far too slightly to be effectively funny and campy. The dialogue during the early character build up phase of the Haskin family was boring. It was simply poorly scripted.

A borderline rental.

5320106,2,B009DH378I,this movie is horrible. some of these people like it for some odd reason which is surprising. but its their opinion none the less.,1365465600,2,130,4.458333333333333
5320107,5,B009DH378I,Good story that kept my attention.  I enjoyed it  Good graphics and a really horrid creature.  Some of the people were rather horrid as well.,1365120000,3,141,4.56
5320108,5,B009DH378I,"Everything about this is amazing, the effects, the lack of cgi, the MONSTER SUIT! The movie, even without the monster is really entertaining, the rednecks, although repulsive, are very entertaining and they did a great job of getting me to root for the family, once the monster shows up though, it just turns incredible! Lets hope for some sequels, or at least more movies like this.",1364774400,8,383,4.818181818181818
5320109,5,B009DH378I,"This is a very cool and original new horror that's really worth checking out, if you love old school horror, practical effects and gore and a man in a suit monster then this has it all, the story is great set on 31st December 1999 a couple goes on vacation to a remote ghost town camping to get away from the end of the world media, they soon get more than they bargained for! The movie has very cool effects the monster is awesome, the gore is great too, the cast is good, the movie moves along really well with several different genres all mixed into one, this is a must see, very smart cool original horror gem!! There are some good features too like a commentary and behind the scenes!! This just shows how a low budget goes a long way!!",1364169600,3,741,4.225352112676056
5320110,5,B009DH378I,Fun film that uses old school in camera effects. Pretty much goes non-stop. Hope they come out with a sequel.,1360022400,4,109,4.5
5320111,2,B009DH378I,"Just when the Haskins think that they have escaped all of the Y2K hysteria by heading in to the hills for a family camping trip, they are kidnapped by a group of inbred hicks and prepared for some good old-fashioned hillbilly rape. Luckily for them, the hills are also home to a giant carnivorous bug that only appears once every thousand years to feed: THE MILLENNIUM BUG! THE MILLENNIUM BUG is what you would get if Lloyd Kaufman were asked to direct CLOVERFIELD. Why anyone thought to cross hixploitation with the giant monster movie is beyond us, but it works! It isn't the the crass humor or the blood-soaked gore that does it necessarily, nor the campy performances, but the incredibly inventive and ambitious set designs and special effects. Kenneth Cran and his talented team of artists fall back on a number of traditional techniques to bring the creature to life on screen. The models and miniatures blend smoothly against the green-screened characters to convincingly trick the eye, at least until they can bring on the giant life-sized puppets. Troma and giant monster fans can get their fix in THE MILLENNIUM BUG!

5320112,5,B009DH378I,"Millennium Bug really impressed me. For starters, there's no CGI in sight. This movie is all about the latex, foam and cool creature effects from ye olden days of movie making. So that alone made me extremely happy. I'm super tired of crappy CGI in films, and you won't see any of that stuff in Millennium Bug.

It's also got a cool story about a family of messed up hillbillies living out in the woods, a crazy scientist, a group of suburbanites trying to escape Y2K, and a massive burrowing bug straight out of viking legend. The production values are spot on, the classic charm of practical monster effects was infectious, the acting was surprisingly solid for a B-grade film, and I had an absolute blast watching it.

Check this movie out. You won't regret it.",1359590400,6,764,4.610294117647059
5320133,5,B009DH378I,"Awesome, Movie! It was better than I ever expected! I'm glad I bought it!

5320137,3,B009DH378I,"The characters in the film are pretty heavy handed, particularly the red neck family. In fact, tedious might be a better word for the first half of the film. But once the monster comes out, it was pretty inspired. Whoever handled the special affects is brilliant. Whoever wrote the script is second rate.",1376870400,2,304,4.754716981132075
5320138,2,B009DH378I,"I gave it 2 stars to be nice becuse of some of the laughable content. The acting is awful, the special effects are terrible and the monster is a train wreck and those are the good parts. I will be upset with myself for awhile for putting myself in front of the tv to watch this disaster. But besides that it wasn't to bad:]",1374105600,,323,4.0625

5320140,5,B009DH378I,"I am not afraid of bugs, well, except for that huge one in the hallway of my parents house when I was about 7 years old. That one was scary. Bugs make a great topic for creepy Sci-Fi movies. Over the decades we movie-goers have seen giant ants, spiders and locust just to name a few. Gargantuan bugs are pretty chilling because we tend to feel helpless around the normal size version of these critters. How do you handle one the size of a truck? That is the question in ""Millennium Bug"".

The story goes that every one thousand years this Buick sized bug bores its way out of the Earth to lay its eggs and die. The eggs hatch and the larva stay in the Earth for a thousand years as the cycle continues. Enter the Haskin Family. They have decided to escape all the Millennium frenzy of Dec 1999 and spend New Year's Eve camping deep in the woods of the Sierra Diablos Mountains. All is fine, battery powered Christmas lights are strung, champagne is opened and now they have bedded down for the evening. Yes all is fine until some wacky hillbillies discover their campsite. The family is  kidnapped but soon discovers the hillbillies aren't their only problem as it is also time for our friend the Millennium Bug to make his grand entrance. Will they escape the clutches of this inbred clan, and if they do, can they run from the Millennium Bug too?

I LOVED this movie. It really was relatable to me and brought me back to my childhood of watching ""Creature Double Feature"" on Boston's channel 56 WLVI TV. I went into it thinking it would be so-so. I was wrong. It was so creatively done. I truly admire the filmmakers on this one and wish I could have been part of this project. It really connected with me. I'll break it down a bit by saying it has elements of five of my favorite movies. The first movie is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chain-Saw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>. These hillbillies could be direct relatives of Leatherface's family with their over the top personalities, rotten teeth and tendency to inbreed. They were so entertaining. I actually think if they were Leatherface's family that these are the hillbilly relatives Leatherface doesn't like to talk about.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B002QRBB30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz</a>&nbsp;comes to mind because of the sets. The Hillbilly family's house was so colorful, dirty and detailed that it was a bit surreal. So many details to look at that tell the story of this demented family.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beetlejuice/dp/B001AGXEA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beetlejuice</a>&nbsp;was referenced in there too, whether deliberately or not, as one of the hillbilly brothers talked like him and had his sense of humor. The next movie, or movies, are the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B003GZBTYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;films. This is where I fell in love because the use of miniatures in ""Millennium Bug"" is second to none. There is no CGI in this film, just miniature sets and a man dressed as the bug, similar to how Godzilla was filmed back in the day. Great special effects all around. Lastly I had a connection with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>&nbsp;the way the filmmakers used dozens of skeletons throughout this flick. You really get the feel that no one escapes this place as our family continues to find human remains everywhere they go.

These comparisons are the best way I can explain how I felt when I watched ""Millennium Bug"". If you enjoy any of the movies I've mentioned, then put ""Millennium Bug"" on your ""must see"" list. Loaded with humor, family love and scary locations deep in the woods, ""Millennium Bug"" is a fun and scary film that I will revisit often so if anyone borrows my copy you must return it!

5320141,5,B009DH378I,"Just by looking at the front cover of this movie, you should have known it was low budget. If you thought it was going to be some awesome monster movie like Cloverfield, then your just as stupid as the plot of this movie was. This movie was exactly as it was intended to be, a GOOD AND GORY OLD FASHION MONSTER MOVIE.

8540310,2,B009DH378I,"Amazon lists this movie as ""Horror, Suspense."" IMDB lists it as ""Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller."" Unfortunately both descriptions are missing one key word: COMEDY! I expected something serious because that's the way this movie was sold. Worst of all, the comedy isn't even funny, it's just immature and embarrassing. I do have something positive to say however (which is why this isn't just a 1-star review): Despite the small sets and obvious green screen usage, the practical effects were quite well done. They were the only element of this film I truly enjoyed. If this movie were serious (or, failing that, if the jokes were FUNNY), then I would've liked this production a whole lot more.",1529884800,,686,4.973913043478261

8540319,4,B009DH378I,"This is another ""B-minus"" movie...and I LOVED it!  God awful acting, every cliche` of a character known to movie-making, the cheapest of effects (but by darn there was NO CGI!), an inbred-Jed-hoedown, a set of the ugliest boobies you'll ever see, death by dildo, and sets that 1960s Japanese Godzille movie makers would have been proud of, the Millennium Bug was a hoot from start to finish.  The characters are so over-the-top, this comes off waaaay more as a comedy than it does Sci-Fi or horror.  But I still had a good time.  This movie doesn't try to be Grade A, but I'll take that B-minus any day of the week!  Recommended.",1389225600,,629,4.580357142857143
