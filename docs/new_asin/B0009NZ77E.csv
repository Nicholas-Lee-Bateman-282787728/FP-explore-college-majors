2304481,5,B0009NZ77E,"Until I saw this documentary, I never really took the time to think about death as I am only in my mid-thirties.  But this documentary goes much further than that and asks why do people go to war and why do people kill others?  There are discussions about why the terror attacks were made on the World Trade Center.  But this analysis goes beyond all the hyped-up media you have seen to date.  The film is about fear of our own mortality.  During the hour you spend watching this film, your eyes are opened to your own fears.  While these feelings may be obvious, the reality as it hits you is almost shocking.  If you would like insight on not only yourself, but the rest of the people on the planet, regardless of race or religion, this documentary is well worth your time.",1120262400,33,775,4.3776223776223775

2304514,2,B0009NZ77E,"Illogic...Illogic...generalizations out to wazoo...This film is riddled with faulty logic. To maintain that man creates religion in order to cope with the fear of death is to imply without any proof that there is no life after death...this is not scientific and you can't simply construct a revision of the history of war assuming that human religion is essentially an after the fact construct.  The religious sense is not primarily directed at self preservation, we have martyrs to prove this, but at the belief that there is an afterlife.  Just because these professors do not believe in an afterlife does not mean that they can run with the assumption that religion is merely a coping mechanism.  To state that all war is caused by difference of religion or culture is meaningless and shamefully naive if not pernicious.  These professors state that the fear of death, creates religions, and religion creates tensions about who's right and who's wrong, and these tensions cause wars in order that we may rise above our own mortality by conquering others.  This is simply ignorant.  Man has needs in order to live...he desires life...he seeks resources to secure his life...he seeks to acquire these resources at the expense of others...this causes most war and creates a history of resentment that fosters other wars...etc. etc... this is humanity's experience of war.  Just because ""academia"" repeats something long enough doesn't make it fact.  There are some wars that may appeal to religion in order to give their side a nobler cause.  The fact is that war is more animal than religious, more Darwinian than symbolic...the symbols are their to pretend that we are not doing it for stupid reasons. Survival of the fittest, might is right, man is the measure of being...these are at the heart of the bloodiest wars the world has known.  The greed for money as a symbolic striving for immortality...what hogwash.  Men strive for money because they seek pleasure and power because in the absence of an afterlife what more is there?  The fact is that these professors while they preach tolerance are actually prolonging a materialistic ideology that can and has logically concluded with the domination of the powerful.",1441065600,4,2220,5.03551912568306

I also appreciate the short interviews of different specialists from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. I especially respect, and love listening to Sheldon Solomon (who appears in the movie many times for short periods, and teaches Beckers theories at Skidmore College).

The movie uses an array of disciplines like anthropology, psychology, history, philosophy and theology to make sense of the strange things we as people tend to do. The viewer that believes the glass is half empty or full may need to pull back and listen to the movie itself in order to realize that you may have just learned WHY you think it one or the OTHER.

The film itself is superb, but I most especially appreciated the extras contained on the DVD (extended interviews, etc.), which were excellent in their own right.

Truly one of the strategies of a well-lived life is to deeply reflect about it's inevitable demise.  My understanding is that the Samurai warriors of old meditated on their own deaths every day in order to live life to it's fullest.  Many cultures around the world consider death just a natural part of the circle of life, but the wealthy Western nations are terrified of this aspect of reality.

2304593,4,B0009NZ77E,"""The Flight From Death: The Quest For Immortality"" is a moving documentary and deals with the subject that, indeed, most people spend their lives trying to avoid: mortality--for all that, though, it isn't a very good representation of Ernest Becker's actual ideas.

There seems to be a  misunderstanding on the part of Greg Bennick and Patrick Shen, the writers of the documentary, that Becker's life changing and devastating sociological/existential tome ""The Denial of Death"" is a different book than Irvin Yalom's ""Existential Psychotherapy"".  Despite having undeniable similarities, they are two different thinkers.  The majority of the documentary is spent politely blaming religion for most of the wars in the world and most human conflicts, though there are a few times when economic strife is mentioned.  Professor Sheldon Solomon, a colorful commentator and university teacher, says at one point ""My god is better than your god and we'll kick your butt to prove it.""  Then the film cuts to a series of footage with people beating each other up in mass crowds, including a rally headed by Mao Zedong.  Strangely enough it is not mentioned that Mao was a ruthless secularist, or that thousands of people have been martyred in Communist countries for holding religious beliefs.

While I'm not denying that religion has contributed to wars and that ""belief"" in a God has for some been an ""immortality project"", Becker himself often put more emphasis on military force and man's lust for power as being an immortality ideology than religion.  If I recall correctly, ""The Denial of Death"" is more informed by the ideas of Soren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich than it is by any hard line materialists.
The cultural fabrication/collective death denial that Becker wrote about may included some forms of *religion*, but he left a very definite door open to the transcendent, as evidenced by every book he wrote.

After 9/11 a lot of politicans used the word ""evil"" as a way to describe the events, and this is somehow wrong in the view of the filmmakers?  What else do we call it when two buildings full of thousands of people are rammed into by planes?  The reaction to September 11th was not religious in nature at all (here I am referring to the invasion of Iraq, not Afghanistan) but a deliberately deceitful series of political maneuvers by men interested in money and power.

On a more positive note, one is not going to leave this documentary unaffected.  The ephemeral nature of our material existence is driven home with real poetry and force, and one cannot help but be impressed by the plight of the female cancer survivor who greets death not with horror or depression, but with a graceful acceptance.  Commendable also is the depth of thought and the sympathy for the poor demonstrated by Professor Sheldon.  If you're interested in an actual elucidation of Ernest Becker's work, though, I'd suggest reading his books.",1221523200,7,2929,4.995884773662551
2304594,5,B0009NZ77E,"This movie is truly phenomenal, though I highly recommend reading (before or after watching the film) the book this movie is based on: The Denial of Death (E. Becker).

The negative reviews of this film interest me, as most of them come off as rather defensive (i.e., arguing that one does not really fear death)... interestingly, this type of behavior makes sense when viewed from the perspective provided in this film. One of the most difficult things a person can do is ADMIT, or become aware, that at their core, their UNCONSCIOUS fear of death motivates their behavior. When this comes to question, the natural response for people who unconsciously fear it the most is to defend their pre-held beliefs at all costs.

Anyway... keep an open-mind and you will certainly benefit from this film. To feel a bit hopeless after watching it is part of the learning process, as this awareness will open new routes to personal growth.",1201132800,6,929,4.836477987421383

2304602,5,B0009NZ77E,"Flight from Death does not try to tackle the question of what happens after death. Instead, it poses questions that ask how dying and death affect living and life. Questions such as: Why do people try to avoid death? Why is death so feared? Why is it so difficult to even think about the inevitability of our own death, much less discuss it? What role does the fear and anxiety of death have in our subconscious? Is the fear and anxiety of death a root motivator behind everyday behaviors?

I'm not sure how much the film actually provides answers these questions, which is good. What makes this film so important is that it puts these difficult, normally avoided questions squarely on the table for discussion, letting us find our own answers.

Ever since I saw Flight from Death at a special screening two years ago in San Francisco, I've thought of it as the most important film I've ever seen. Over time, waiting for the DVD, I wondered if I'd feel the same. I do. For those of us who have spent part of life surrounded by death, this film helps to make 'impossible' conversations possible.

One last thing that I found so wonderfully refreshing is that Flight from Death doesn't treat death in a slow-moving, somber or sullen tone. Through quick editing, some fast-motion cinematography and lively, thought-provoking interviews, the film treats death as a meaningful celebration of life. As I remember Toni Riss (the breast cancer patient interviewed in the film) saying at the special SF screening in 2003, ""Faced with death, living my life has never been better.""",1127865600,32,1570,4.785977859778598
2304603,3,B0009NZ77E,"I was very much looking forward to this movie -- partly because of the great reviews and mostly because it seemed like a perfect documentary to show in my undergrad sociology course. But, having just watched it, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed. Given the subject matter, I expected something much more insightful and thought-provoking than this. While there are certainly great snippets of footage and commentary here and there, a lot of the footage was artsy filler, the soundtrack was, in some parts, quite unbearable and, most importantly, a lot of the commentary fell short of the in-depth elaboration this fascinating and highly complex topic deserves. The flow and insight improved in the second half of the film, but the first half hour or so was unnecessarily drawn out with  not always relevant imagery and very redundant commentary. The point being made over and over can be summarized quite briefly:

Because we are physical creatures endowed with consciousness and intellect capable of pondering our own death, we spend our lives experiencing extreme anxiety about our inevitable demise and compensate (or, in many instances, overcompensate) for it with creativity or destruction (in this movie, the emphasis is on hostility and destruction.)

The text on the back of the DVD promises a life-affirming film, but I felt that some parts of it were unnecessarily grim and morbid. I am not referring to the disturbing images of violence and suffering -- those are only appropriate in the given context. But then, there are running bits like that of a woman suffering from an advanced form of breast cancer interviewed in a mausoleum. We hear her talking about how she is fighing a battle with the disease -- fighting for her life -- while watching footage of her walking amongst tombstones over and over and over again... Given the artistic ambitions of this film, one wonders if the filmmakers picked this interview locale for the accentuated symbolic effects but that would be insensitive, if not unethical, no? If she herself likes to hang out at cemetaries, we don't hear about it from her (and that, in itself, would make for very relevant and interesting commentary...)

Overall, I feel that this film could be greatly improved if it, on the one hand, did not try so hard to be artistic, while, on the other hand, granted the viewer a less dumbed-down view of the actual theory at hand and its implications. The members of the research team at the heart of the documentary offer the most intriguing insight, but even they seem to be holding back (this, perhaps, is to be attributed more to the editing job than their original input.)I also think that this film tries too hard to be ""beautiful"" and, does it, sadly, at the expense of its content. The way it is now, this film could be much shorter -- or -- would need to fill those 85 minutes with more stimulating and challenging insight (more theory, more background, more  interviews from a wider variety of ""experts"", posing more questions -- even if they are open-ended, etc.)

I gave this documentary three stars because, despite my grumblings, there is still a lot of good stuff there and it appears to have had dramatic impact on some people, which means that it is doing its job for some. But I will not be showing it in my class because it I don't think that it succeeds as an educational documentary (though it does not claim to be one.)",1126051200,11,3420,4.788135593220339

I have not been able to get this movie out of my head - I even went out and bought the book it was based on, Denial of Death by Ernest Becker. Fascinating read, fascinating movie. If you desire to better understand yourself and your place in it, you need to watch this movie. I can't remember the last time a movie made me think this much.",1121644800,22,488,4.041237113402062

8063809,5,B0009NZ77E,"This movie was assigned to me in a death in society class, and it was insanely insightful. It raises a lot of good points about death and our views of it from our own culture to those around us and how we relate to those with different views on death. I never really thought of death and dying as being something so close to the forefront of our minds - I know I don't consciously think about my impending death unless I'm in a risky situation or my son is in one. It's amazing. I would definitely recommend this movie if you're even remotely interested in psychology, sociology, politics, religion, whatever. Just anything. This is a great movie.",1473897600,2,647,4.491525423728813
8063810,2,B0009NZ77E,"I watched this on a recommendation from a colleague, but I'm sorry to say the show did not appeal to me.

It offers some leftist academics with their usual agenda, who don't know how to speak without using profane language (always a tell-tale sign of a liberal, as they don't respect the views or values of others), a two second shot of a priest saying that many wars have been based on religion to help bolster their claims and laboratory experiments, and then plenty of stock footage of wars, violence being committed by who knows who for unknown reasons, probably nothing related to anything they're talking about, but otherwise helps make the viewer feel bad about themselves for fearing death, other cultures, and most everything else.

If you want the usual drivel from liberal academics that reinforce your view that religion causes wars, that introverted people and others with higher levels of anxiety must cling to ancient superstitions and conservative politics to maintain their self esteem in the world, and that only higher-minded educated types in the western world can shine a light to our dark ages, well then this is the show for you.",1473897600,,1152,4.902564102564103
