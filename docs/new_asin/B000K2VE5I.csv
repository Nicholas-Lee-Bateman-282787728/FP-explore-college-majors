My brother, who loves movies like this, also enjoyed it. His only complaints were that there should have been a crow-bar as a weapon, and he wished the one guy hadn't been shirtless for most of the movie (lol).",1370217600,,363,4.432835820895522
8154071,5,B000K2VE5I,"Another low budget shot on video zombie/infected human movie. The difference is that the directing behind this movie makes it. Yes, of course the acting really isn't anything to write home about. The gore was great (thanks to Ricky Lee) and the location of the Red Skulls house was such a great choice. It added that alone, confined feeling that Night Of The Living Dead had.

Check it out, I loved it.",1180915200,,402,4.583333333333333
8154072,2,B000K2VE5I,"The best thing about the Red Skulls DVD is the cover art. I was totally sucked in by the cool artwork and movie description. This is a current movie that tries hard for the look and feel of an old B movie. Part of the charm of those older low budget films was that the effects technology wasn't available yet so the film makers made due with what they had and made up for it with strong characters and a cool story. This movie has neither. The actors sound like robots delivering their lines, I mean you don't even get a sense of their personalities because all the lines are delivered so flat. The lead characters don't have the presence or charisma to make you care at all what happens to them and those are the good actors in this movie. Oh I can't end this review without mentioning how absurd some of the wardrobe was. Seems like every character had something out of grandpa's workshed hanging off his belt or around their neck...a horseshoe, a hubcap, was that a cheese grater I just saw?....yah ridiculous in a bad way. If you think you're in for a B movie experience like the Warriors, Class of 1984 or any of those classic gang movies you'll be very dissapointed.",1180137600,,1172,4.405529953917051

The Red Skulls accomplished this. Now, I am not claiming it is to be put up next to the next Mission Impossible in quality. Heck not even the Devils Rejects or more aptly The Warriors. BUT for what this film set out to be, an entertaining low budget horror film that goes beyond what most expect out of this genre, it passed with flying colors. The effects are a huge leap forward than many I have seen in other films of this level and especially compared to those of this companies previous works. The technical quality is also a big step forward from what you might expect. The writing is also pretty good. The acting, as is to be expected, does sag as well as soar but overall it's not that bad. Bottom line this film DESERVES attention and at least an initial viewing if not several. If you like low budget horror this is definitely for you. If you like gang movies check this out. And if you like seeing an indie film group truly at work trying to entertain the world watch this film!!!  Also the DVD is PACKED with a lot of really cool special features.  Two behind the scenes docs, an outtake reel, a music video, a really funny commentary from the cast and crew, AND a sneak peek at thier new film Cordoba Nights.  Pretty good stuff!!!!",1162512000,3,1415,4.476744186046512
