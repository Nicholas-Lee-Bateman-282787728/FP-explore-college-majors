6517515,4,B00M0GM4DS,"This is a superior movie of its genre.

Denzel Washington reprises the role of Robert McCall- originally played by Edward Woodward in the 1985-1989 television series.

He's an apparently mild mannered worker in a large building supplies store. The first half hour of the film is taken up with character development, then the action revenge theme emerges, taking you on a violent journey as McCall ""equalizes"" the evil done by a Russian crime syndicate which has infiltrated Boston.

If you like this kind of movie, you will enjoy the Equalizer. It is a well crafted example of the genre.

Note that there are some particularly violent scenes.

Washington's McCall is a complex and intense character- a decent, dignified and peaceable law abiding citizen, who becomes a violent and ruthlessly efficient killer in the face of adversity. As I watched the movie, I thought that Mr Washington's character was a personification of the credo: ""Freedom is not Free"".

Certainly he portrays the role very well, combining with a cleverly written screenplay to deliver an entertaining- if sometimes shocking- movie experience.",1411862400,7,1115,5.201117318435754
6517516,4,B00M0GM4DS,"It isn't often that a TV series such as ""The Equalizer"" transitions well into a film,and the same can be said about popular or award winning novels, or even comic books or comic book characters. It all comes down to the writing and if you have enough talent and creativity to to upgrade and update a show such as this one. Denzel Washington has the ability to really bring a character like this to life. Its his natural acting style and personality on screen that can take even a mediocre script or character and ad depth. ""The Equalizer"" ends up delivering on a solid story and script and leaves its cheesier TV roots behind where it belongs. I'm refraining from revealing anything about the film as I feel I may ruin it for others, but The Equalizer delivers hands down and it may possibly be one of the better of the fall film releases before the big Christmas holiday block busters come out. Worth every penny,see it for yourself.",1411776000,5,934,4.5325443786982245

The Equalizer was intense and full of action.  A man believes that he has but his past life behind him and he has dedicated himself to a new life of peace and quite.  That is until he meets a nice young girl who is under the control of some very violent Russian gangsters.  It is then that he decides to go back to how he use to be to help this girl.  The film was based on of a TV show from the 1980's that was written by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim while this adaption was written by Richard Wenk.  This film was directed by Antoine Fuqua who is known for films such as Olympus Has Fallen, King Arthur and Training Day.

This film starts off with Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) going through his daily routine.  He is a very helpful person and it shows because there is this one employee, Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), at Home Mart that is trying to become a security guard and Robert is doing what he can to help him succeed.  Not being able to sleep Robert goes to a local diner every night and he reads a book and drinks some tea.  It is there where he meets a nice young girl named Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz).  She has dreams of being a singer but due to the life that she is in she is unable to really pursue her dreams.

Then one night Teri has to take a call and it ends up to be a client who tries to be a little rough with her so she hits him.  This upsets her boss Slavi (David Meunier) and to teach her and the other girls in the business a lesson he has her beaten to near death.  Robert had grown to like the company of Teri and when he finds out that Slavi had her beaten he snaps and decides to take things into his own hands and help her get out of the business so she can pursue the dreams she always wanted to.

This was a great film to watch and I enjoyed watching it but I can't believe it was as graphic as it was.  Now I know that films from Antoine Fuqua are intense but I did not expect it to be nearly as bloody and  graphic.  I am not going to go into details on everything because then I would ruin the movie but I will tell you one scene I feel I could have lived without.  There is a fight scene where Robert stabs a corkscrew just below this guys chin and you see it all bloody coming out in his mouth. There was a ton of things like this and I am not the biggest fan of scenes like this but somehow Antoine did a good job at making it seem necessary.

Denzel does a great job in yet another film and he connects with everyone well in this film which makes it even that more believable.  Like the scene in the preview where the lady at Home Mart gets her ring stolen and he keeps her calm and then he deals with the guy.

Overall I would give this film a B.  It was a great film to watch and I enjoyed it, but for me personally I couldn't get past all the blood and the issues towards the end.  I think the same film could have been made with about 1/3 of the amount of blood.",1411776000,12,2968,3.9830795262267342
6517518,3,B00M0GM4DS,"Not for the first time, Denzel Washington lends his A-list star power--his regal and stoic gravity--to a mediocre action film.  The latest is The Equalizer, a cinematic adaptation of the hit '80s television series.  The film reunites the actor with Antoine Fuqua, the director of Training Day, the suspenseful drama for which he won an Academy Award for his captivating performance as a deceitful and volatile detective gone wrong.  Any presumed actor/director magic is largely absent the second time, unfortunately.  Washington stars as Robert ""Bob"" McCall, a former soldier and intelligence-agency operative now leading a quiet life as a widower in Boston.  He controls his violent impulses.  He reads.  He is employed at a Home Depot-style store.  And when he cannot sleep, he visits a twenty-four-hour diner.  Another frequent visitor to the diner is Teri (Chlo Grace Moretz), a put-upon teenage prostitute and aspiring singer.  When she is nearly beaten to death by her pimp and his gang, Bob steps in to deal brutal justice.  His actions enrage and frighten the head of the pimp's organization.  He in turn sends an elite henchman (a scenery-devouring and slightly low-rent Marton Csokas) from Moscow to Boston to investigate, inciting a broader conflict.

The Equalizer is at its best near the beginning and the end.  The early scenes establishing the protagonist's moderation-centric civilian life and teasing his ferocious interior self are engaging, well-acted, and exhibit a welcome patience and restraint.  Not restrained in any way, but very exciting is a third-act action sequence set in the aforementioned home-improvement retail store; a long list of their products, including barbed wire and a nail gun, are weaponized before the fight is over.  Between these two highlights lies a problematic film lasting an indulgent 130-plus minutes, including multiple one-after-the-other endings.  There is a generic quality to the tattooed, woman-hating, post-Soviet antagonists, and Moretz is underutilized in her role as their victim; once the foul treatment of her soulful and traumatized character sets the plot in motion, she is discarded until an afterthought of a scene near the end.  And, to be honest, the film tends to overplay its hand in regard to Washington's natural, hard-edged cool.  There are several moments of truly riveting hand-to-hand combat, as well as one or two instances of tantalizing art-of-war mind games, but there is also, for example, a scene finding him almost gliding away in slow motion as a vast explosion engulfs the area behind him.  He does not flinch, of course.  It is the type of groan-worthy, often-spoofed, more-bad-a*s-than-thou image indicating invincibility, and this deflates rather than intensifies the suspense moving forward.",1411776000,13,2783,5.381062355658199
6517519,5,B00M0GM4DS,"The story line is enjoyable throughout the movie.
It's not one of those films where you just want it to end.  It draws you in with all sorts of nuances.
Denzel is living the life of somebody that works at a Home Depot type of store, though they of course make it a slightly different name.
He tells some of his co-workers that he was one of the back up dancers known as the Pips...  if you remember those days of cool music.
It turns out he also was involved in some sort of spying activity...  which of course gave the character an excuse to have all sorts of fighting skills and knowledge on how to do about anything from improvised explosives to setting up electronic remote watching ability.
When a hooker he likes is beat up and he tries to buy her way out of the Russian mob control, they refuse and thus the action plot line is set.
It's a much better movie than your typical Steven Seagal predictable slugfest.
I always liked the old TV show Equalizer.  Although different in certain aspects at least this movie lies up to the script quality of the old series and has even more action than it did.",1411689600,17,1105,4.323671497584541
6517520,4,B00M0GM4DS,"There are quite a few movies like: Interstellar, Fury, Mockingjay Part 1, and many more that I am looking forward to seeing as the months progress.  Today and today only, I finally got the opportunity to see The Equalizer.
Robert McCall is the primary main character here. In the movie, we see that he works at a hardware store, has a nice but notably somewhat empty apartment, and usually spends his nights at a nearby diner. On one of these nights, Robert comes across a girl Teri. They strike up a conversation and a sort of friendship, until one of these nights Terri is revealed to be in the ICU. And so begins, The Equalizer.
Denzel Washington is very respectable and a highly intelligent actor. And it shows in The Equalizer.  He has a wonderful outing as Robert McCall. Reminiscent of his roles in Man on Fire and a little bit of Safe House, he brings the dramatic flair and packs some SERIOUS heat in the action sequences. On to Chloe Moretz, she displays amazing range in her acting ability; and does a Great job as Teri.  The supporting cast involved in the film does a nice job, while the character development held to keep the film on the right track.
The Equalizer not only has a talented cast, but it also has a well scripted story to back it up. And again, the action scenes are really well choreographed; being that they are very brutal and pretty bloody.
By having a successful first and second act and a thrilling third act, The Equalizer is a no-holds barred action packed movie that is very likable and worth the admission. I won't call this the classic that Training Day was back in 2001 with Denzel and director Antoine Fuqua at the helm, but they have not made a bad movie in The Equalizer. GO SEE The Equalizer.

6517521,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Look, nobody has been more critical of Denzel Washington over the last few years than me, and it has nothing to do with the man's ability to command the screen. Washington is one of our great treasures, a timeless star with a seemingly endless reservoir of cool. But fulfilling roles are few and far between. For every chance he gets to star in something like Flight, he'll do three or four mediocre but money-making films like 2 Guns, Safe House, and Unstoppable. On the surface The Equalizer would seem to fit into that latter category. It's a throwback that checks all the boxes in the tortured action hero model. There's even a slow-motion walk away from a gigantic explosion. But there's also something to be said for a film that allows Denzel to do his best Charles Bronson in Death Wish, and even if there aren't many surprises The Equalizer is one kick-ass film from start to finish.

Many will recognize The Equalizer from the cult favorite 1980s TV series led by Ed Woodward, but they'll see few similarities in the bleak and bloody version directed by Training Day's Antoine Fuqua. Something about when Denzel hooks up with Fuqua that brings out the best in him. It's the freedom to show his dark side, and Denzel always eats up those opportunities when they come around. He plays Robert McCall, a genial, helpful stock guy at a Home Depot-type store. This being The Equalizer, we know that no guy can be quite as happy as McCall seems to be. His barely-furnished home reeks of loneliness, and unable to sleep McCall frequents the same diner each morning at 2am. There he meticulously arranges the condiments, reads his book, and converses with Elena (Chloe Grace Moretz), the headstrong yet troubled prostitute apparently using the place as her base of operations. Their conversations are friendly, but distant. She has hopes of something more out of life and he's eager to encourage her out of the business. When a bunch of Russian goons beat her up, sending her to the hospital, McCall does what any average Home Depot employee would do, which is systematically destroy her attackers with a lethal flurry of violence. It's not just that he wipes out four heavily-armed goons all by himself; it's how he does it. Coldly, calmly assessing the situation beforehand, McCall's impulses kick into action. So what if he's a bit slower than he was back in the day (yes, he sets his stopwatch to clock everything), this is McCall in his natural element; not stacking plywood.

This is Denzel in full Man on Fire-mode; confident, brooding, a lean mean murdering machine who makes killing look smooth and easy. His slick demeanor is matched by the bottled ferocity of Marton Csokas, who plays Teddy, a psychotic Russian fixer sent in to discover who has disrupted the mob's operations. What McCall doesn't know is that his moment of vengeance has attracted the attention of some people in very high places, and they want him dead. What ensues isn't really a game of cat and mouse as it is cat vs. cat. McCall and Teddy are pretty brazen and upfront about what they intend to do to one another, and the body count skyrockets before the inevitable showdown. That McCall has a nemesis worthy of being feared is a credit to screenwriter Richard Wenk, who along with Fuqua's unsubtle direction creates a film that glorifies its violent excesses. Fuqua loves tough-guy movies like this and is well-suited to the task. Visual inventiveness has never been his specialty and The Equalizer doesn't demand it from him. All you need to know about Wenk is that he also wrote The Expendables and 16 Blocks. There's not a lot of nuance to be found in the story itself, but Denzel adds what layers he can to McCall's evolution into a street vigilante. He's a man who has always prided himself on righting wrongs, but a promise to never resort to killing again has him torn and seeking the help of old CIA friends (Melissa Leo and Bill Paxton in minor cameos) before embarking on a dark path.

The Equalizer is brutal stuff, and the constant bloodshed could have been numbing if Denzel wasn't such an engaging hero. Even during the wildly ridiculous final showdown which has McCall butchering his foes with power tools (worst product placement ever!!!), you can't help but cheer for the guy. Is he probably just as much of a monster as the people he's killing? Maybe, but that's a question that's never really asked and desperately needs to be explored. Its possible McCall will ask himself that question in the already green lit sequel. Or perhaps not. The Equalizer doesn't bother with the heavy stuff; it does what it promised to do which is deliver an entertaining, action-packed experience and one of Denzel's better recent performances.",1411689600,464,4728,4.784577723378213

6517934,3,B00M0GM4DS,"FIRST...I love Denzel Washington one of my favorite actors. I rented this movie ONLY because he was in it period! But I could only see this movie about halfway through. The reason was because its so filled with fantasy and unrealistic scenesl! Denzel is a great actor and much respect for him, but I felt like I was watching a spider man flick with the way he was killing ans defeating his opponents with ease. Here is an average man killing his foes with such accuracies and perfection. This was like watching a deadpool movie. I couldn't watch it anymore and had to bail out about halfway, it was too silly. 5 Stars for Denzel but this movie gets 3 or less stars for the unrealistic plot and storyline. If their is a school that teaches these fighting moves and techniques that Denzel's character has PLEASE tell me where so I can sign up!  : ))",1528070400,,847,4.42948717948718

6517936,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Oh, My Gosh, this movie is explosive. If there were really men such as this to protect . Denzel played the character without flaw. My Gosh this is the best movie I have seen yet. I understand a second equalizer is to be released soon. I can't wait until it hit dvd. Great movie
Reading the Goofs, well,people don't notice because they are into the  plot of the movies. This seems to be someone who had a lot of time on their hands  had nothing  else to do. but points out  nothing The movie is a great action pack movie. It was clean, it has a punch for reason of the character McCall which is  fighting for the helpless. Believe it or not there is sex trafficking here in the united states. young ladies prostituting against their will. while the justice turns a blind eye. because there are politicians involved. It starts with underhand dealings export /import. This more like trumps world. it's all about money. who would pimp out his own to get what he wants. Our economy is now collapsing, because there is too much money floating around by ways of money laundering here in the united states doing business with foreign countries, Russia is the biggest client for trump, when the country bailed out his businesses, And admission of his trumps son Eric in an interview. .",1527897600,,1276,4.530434782608696

6517956,3,B00M0GM4DS,"First of all, I don't know anything about the show on which this movie is based. I went in hoping it would be a solid, meat and potatoes vigilante movie, and for the most part, it delivers. Denzel Washington plays Bob, a mysterious but good-hearted loner and Home Depot...sorry, Home Mart employee. When his friend Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a prostitute employed by the Boston division of the Russian Mob, is horribly abused by a client, Bob takes on her employers in true vigilante fashion. In addition to its immaculate look and feel - cinematographer Mauro Fiore (Avatar) does some very impressive work here - the other quality of this movie that really kept my attention is its skilled character building. From his devotion to his friends to his Inspector Poirot-like precision when it comes to arranging his silverware, Fuqua proves that showing character building is much more compelling than expositing about it. The movie is predictable to a fault - so much so that my interesting took a nosedive at the beginning of the third act - and while watching Bob do what he does to bad guys is compelling as it is gruesome, his near-invincibility makes suspending disbelief difficult and dilutes the stakes. All the same, I still recommend it, especially if your diet of bloodless superhero movie action has left you hungry for the good stuff. It's also worth watching to see David Harbour's pre-Stranger Things turn as a corrupt cop.",1527033600,,1436,4.889344262295082

6517965,5,B00M0GM4DS,"There is a reason why Denzel Washington is one of the great actors of all time, and I think it's demonstrated in this movie. I make my point by alluding to another great actor and movie. The actor is Marlon Brando, the movie is, well,...The Godfather. It's been commented often that, although Brando is in only about 38 minutes of the movie, when people think of the movie, they essentially think of him. His presence dominants the whole film. It's the same with Washington; from the moment we see him on the screen, all we focus on is him, and how he acts and reacts to the difficult choices put in front of him.

6518062,4,B00M0GM4DS,"When this was first announced, I had my doubts.  Then I saw it on cable and happily my doubts were removed.  This movie was inspired by the tv show, and Edward Woodward was to Robert McCall like Sean Connery was to James Bond.

Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast and crew get your buy in at the very beginning.  This movie has more of a believable edge that the tv show, and Denzel Washington's portrayal of Robert McCall is perfect.  He plays McCall as a man who was just sitting on the sidelines, trying to live the remainder of his life in peace and harmony, and then crime and violence enter his life and he, as his character states it simply, ""Has to hit something stupid.""

The side stories fit into the main story, there is a nod to the original series, yet the movie explores something that the tv show did not.  One can be a force for good by being a coach, a friend, and an active member of the community, but be prepared to stand up for what you believe and hold those who have our public trust accountable.

6518085,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Since both this and John Wick 1 came out in 2014 they were naturally compared to each other. In my opinion, as much as I love John Wick this is the stronger movie. John Wick is a great ""dirty pleasure"" movie seeing a guy put as many rounds into bad guys as possible in as short of amount of time. But aside from that, that is literally all it is.

The Equalizer is a philosophical action movie, about a guy that COULD choose to remain anonymous enjoy his retirement and let evil people hurt a girl he has absolutely no relation to. But as the great quote in the movie says, ""Sometimes something happens to someone who care about and you do something because you can"". That powerful quote and many other messages in this movie are why this is one of the greatest action movies of all time. It is not just about leaving a body count(although that does happen!) it is about sending a message to the Russians that they messed with the wrong person.",1518307200,,944,4.333333333333333

Above-average re-telling of the TV show  not an easy task when 1) there are mini-legions of fans and 2) the original was about a white Brit.

First-time through didn't like the ending ... there seemed to be three or four of them. Second time around was OK.

6518202,4,B00M0GM4DS,"What you need to know: Denzel Washington stars as a man on fire ignited by a Russian mob who spurns his efforts at buying one of their pleasure girls out from their business. His Special Ops training makes him a brutal and efficient killing machine, but he only ever does just enough to make his point, and isn't interested in carnage for carnages sake.

What you want to know: For Washington fans the man plays a cool, intelligent, and confident character much in line with the majority of his roles. He is not showy or flashy, and he actually isn't a threatening figure in this movie (as he was in Training Day and some of his other films). Depending on what you're hoping for this will delight you or leave you wanting more. The violence is brutal, proficient (quick), and gratuitous in what they show. Though there is sexual subject matter/ situations they are light and not salacious or the focus of the film. This shouldnt be surprising to Washington fans as hes never lent his talents to a film that has really strong and overtly sexualized themes that are splashed across the screen but people who are looking for the seedier side in their visuals should look elsewhere.

What you might not expect: Fans of the old The Equalizer TV series starring Edward Woodward aren't getting the same equalizer here excepting that Washington chooses to help a few associates out with their problems that seem to be in need of solving only through violence and death. Hes not a Robin Hood out looking to do good, hes just a quiet guy with a heaviness in his heart who has been keeping his head down and has been caring for and encouraging people he works with and has frequent contact with. If there are overt nods to the old series Im not aware of them but this movie has less in common with a Burn Notice type of ethos than it does with a person who can say, You shouldnt have messed with my friends. Also not expected is how Washingtons character, a warehouse worker, makes use of the tools and the warehouse itself to defeat the bad guys. Washingtons character, though apparently a weapons master, is all about going low rent and making use of his surroundings. In fact he seems to go out of his way to do so as this heightens his heroic actions and makes him seem almost super heroic at times as well as it makes him distinct from the bad guys, but perhaps its also a comment on gun culture? Im likely just reaching, but it makes me wonder.",1509062400,,2439,4.478651685393259

6518232,4,B00M0GM4DS,"This is a very entertaining action film done with style and the usual great performance by Denzel Washington.  I'm rating it compared to others within this genre and not against a broader range of good movies where it's not such a fair comparison.  The film has some serious violence but mostly in fairly quick bursts rather than lingering on brutality and gore. Theres no complex story or deep meaning herejust the pursuit of street justice for the wicked preying upon the weak.  And it does require more than a little suspension of disbelief and forgiveness for cliched characters and sentiments. Washington plays Robert McCall, a retired operative (no detail about his background) with a very high level of skills who decides he needs to bring justice for those who can't fend for themselves, starting with the destruction of a Russian mob with various criminal activities in his city.  He turns out to be a one-man wrecking crew who can't be stopped, even by a vicious sociopath who tries to kill this mysterious adversary taking down the baddies.  I haven't seen the TV series this seems to be based on, but the movie is satisfying on its own. The direction and cinematography are stylish and affecting.  My only real complaint is that the ending is a bit too happy/sappy and the final music is totally overbearing and obnoxious--both the final scene and with the credits afterward.  It's a jarring way to conclude a film that was so well-done until then.",1506816000,,1460,4.839357429718875

6518310,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Outstanding.
I love certain wines, but do not have the words to express what is exactly that differentiates one I find outstanding ... from one that is quite good...

So it is with this movie....

Some combination of the pace, camera angles,  directing, music, the original ways of disposing of villains... in a Home Depot setting, and of course,  Mr. Washington's smooth, believable portrayal of tortured soul that like the Old Man in The Sea, must be and do what he is must do...

Whatever the magic is...this film is an outstanding creation...like a fine wine.  Enjoy",1501545600,6,570,4.824742268041237

The guy is such an amazing actor and I believe him in every role I've seen him in. This film is no exception. Yes, it's very violent, but it's a good kind of violence and the back story is written well enough to make you care about the protagonist. The bad guys even have some good character actors in the roles. It may be a guy thing, but I happen to like a good violent film with great acting, and I found one here.",1500163200,,543,4.180952380952381

However, it is a super intense & unbelievably great action film.  Denzel Washington is absolutely stellar, as usual.  NOT FOR YOUNG AUDIENCE!!!  Vice subject & quite a bit of blood, but it is riveting, & if you can get past the language, it's a great ""stick-up for the little guy"" film. :) jlp",1497484800,,427,4.341772151898734

Characters were introduced with no supporting foundation. The viewer is left only to assume certain things. Action was decent, but there are better action movies out there with an actual storyline. I would not recommend spending any money to watch this.",1489104000,,388,5.174603174603175

I liked it a lot and found a great way to spend a couple of hours just enjoying some great acting on Denzel's part in an action film......and far superior than most we see.  I give him very high marks for his skills at giving the character some depth. Relax and enjoy some action with Denzel.......he makes it work.,1488844800,,482,4.454545454545454

6518777,3,B00M0GM4DS,If you like Denzel and good production value you should enjoy this one though the plot is over the top and highly predictable through out the movie. Youre pretty much in the know on whats about to happen next and when you don't its really not a surprise when it does happen. The ending was excellent and certainly a setup for another film. Its pretty hard to believe most of what happens in the movie and if you're good with someone with the kill sets that Denzel has working in a home center then just sit back and enjoy it. Its just another action hero flick and not too many actors could pull it off and with a straight face throughout. Seems like the ratings on movies you can see on this site are getting higher IMdB scores now that its an Amazon company so Id discount that rating and go more with the 57 Metascore.,1485648000,,821,4.269230769230769

I started watching it with my two college aged girls and we finally had to turn it off.  The language was atrocious.  I just looked it up and there are 100 ""f"" words.  Seriously?  I can let a few slide even though I shouldn't and I knew it was R going in but why in the world would the writers do that?  Ruined the movie for us.

The personality quirks were a nice touch, well thought-out. And I love love love how the Amazon digital videos give tidbits of facts about the film's and actors.

6519389,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I really liked this movie and have watched it a lot.  Denzel Washington plays a great tough guy but is also a nice person that you really like.  He becomes an unstoppable avenger and takes down an entire organization that is steeped in corruption, drugs, hookers and other illegal activities.  This movie seems almost realistic in the way it is written, and the acting is quite good.  The story line is almost believable, and I say almost because  most people that would try to do what Denzel Washington gets away with would be killed in the process.  And perhaps I am being a little unreasonable here, but the authorities never seem to care about what Denzel Washington is doing, which does not pass the test of reason. This is definitely a fantasy movie.  Luck is with Denzel Washington, and the good guy wins in the end.  It definitely qualifies as an action movie with only one casualty of a girl that did not deserve to die.  All the bad guys receive their just deserts, as they say.",1476576000,6,988,4.536723163841808

6519501,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Surprisingly good.  Well acted by Denzel Washington as a seemingly quiet, normal, helpful, regular guy who works at the big box home improvement center (aka Home Depot or Lowe's).  He's also OCD and insomniac.  So he spends nights at the 24 hour diner, reading the top 100 ""must read"" books.  Here he befriends a lonely call girl.  She seems intelligent.  They talk.  He wants to help, especially after she is roughed up by the Russian bad guys who ""own"" her.  Then, basically all hell breaks loose.  We discover he has many skills.  Special skills.  And if he wants to eliminate you; he will.  For remainder of movie, our hero dispatches Russian bad guys, and a few crooked cops with swift and bloody justice.  This movie kept me awake, alert, and interested from beginning to end.  If you like this genre, you'll like the Equalizer.",1475798400,,834,4.701388888888889

Very well acted, fight scenes that are (very violent) and terrifically well choreographed. This movie is also shot well, and just makes it under the wire for suspension of disbelief. And at the end of the day, a decent enough story to hang it all on -- largely because the characters were developed so that you could identify with them and their actions.

He returns to that life because of an incident that happens, which I don't want to give away and be a spoiler. He is a person, who on the exterior seems very quite and cool. But there is on the interior a volcano of violence and necessary killing. But with his great acting there is still a vulnerablity he possess.

I'm not going to write a long review, detailing the movie and certain specifics , you need to watch it for yourself. Why would I ruin a great movie by giving out details that people may read ( Some people read reviews before watching a movie, and a lot of people spoil the movies even with minor details ) before watching it?

I'll leave it at this: It's a well beyond great movie, and although some reviews say some of it is predictable, that does not change the fact that it's an awesome movie. What movie doesn't have a bit of predictability to it? Plus, it's F***ing DENZEL WASHINGTON!",1472342400,,751,4.251748251748252

Ever since Glory, he has repeatedly and increasingly shown himself to be that something amazing. Denzel and his excellent work in The Equalizer is many, many times over the price of admission; being able to spend an evening taking in both his genius and beauty, with drama, revenge and violence with a greater purpose on the side.....is a pleasure commoners like me so rarely deserve. A Denzel does not come along every generation. So grab the moment, watch the movie and turn your ho-hum night into a evening of pure and delicious sensation. I do not hand out 5 stars often, but after watching this I will be smiling til morning.",1471910400,,760,4.67910447761194

6520277,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Our seemingly ordinary working-class hero slowly decides to take on the dreaded evil ""Russian Mafia"" to help clean up clean up his neighborhood. He's experienced and meticulous and oh so resourceful... especially when he finally lures his adversaries to HIS turf... the big-box home improvement store where he works. He's such an accomplished warrior that he hardly ever touches guns throughout the film so there are many nifty weapon-surprises. Amazingly, none of it comes off as trite entertainment because his enemies feel authentic and very dastardly down to their devilish tattoos. It gets serious! But we also see Denzel's warmth shining through. If you're into a competent good-guy action hero fighting evil with a little help from his friends, and you don't mind graphic bloody scenes, this film has about everything you need.

6520718,5,B00M0GM4DS,"The Academy Award winning Actor - Denzel Washington, out does himself in this superb and electrifying, action and adventure, drama. In his magnificent portrayal of THE EQUALIZER, he depicts the character of McCall - a former Washington, D.C. and Military Operative, who was trying to live the quiet life while putting his top secret career, behind him. Content to live in his self-imposed, retired state... that is, until he meets a young girl who was forced into prostitution and is being held in check, by the supremely arrogant and violent, Russian Mafia. Actress Chloe Grace Moretz plays the role of Teri - the unwilling prostitute, who wants to get out of the ""business"" and pursue a singing career but is viciously and brutally beaten by her subjugating captors the Russian Mobsters, for even daring to think that way. Freedom - is not always appreciated by insecure, possessive and jealous people. Why? Because jealous, control freaks, will always try and choke the life out of you, figuratively or literally or both. But not before, she's met and is befriended by: THE EQUALIZER. Seeing, that she is all alone and on her death bed with no one to take up the 'Baton of Justice' and rightful vengeance on her behalf, McCall comes out of retirement to try and settle the score with her brutal and inhumane, Russian pimps. This intriguing plot thickens when he try's to 'buy her out' from that lifestyle, by offering to pay them $9,800 dollars for her freedom. When that fails, he decides to annihilate them. This enthralling, exciting and explosive film from Columbia Pictures, comes to it's audience in color on a single, DVD-disc. And although it depicts brutal violence and graphic human carnage, it is quite appropriate and satisfying. How so? Because it depicts warranted retribution which is definitely, in line with the story's content and theme. This motion picture is so riveting, that I myself..., wanted to jump inside the TV set and start kicking some butt! Because sometimes, the only thing that vicious, hardened, criminals and in this case - the Russian Mafia, understand... is violent vengeance and destruction on their own turf. For the most part, when you ""give them a taste of their own medicine"" and then some, suddenly! they get the  revelation, that you mean business. You can't always be: Mr. Nice Guy or Girl. And for the helpless victims, forceful physical vengeance (a solid beat down combined with a good old fashioned cussing session about who they are NOT!) .... resonates, for the sake of justice and personal satisfaction. Especially, when defending a friend or a loved one. And so, with mesmerizing, special and very deadly effects, this intense film is sure to please and entertain. Particularly if, you believe that warranted and deadly paybacks are a vital necessity to eradicate criminals in defense of another, re-establish justice and restore tranquility. I'm a firm believer that: ""Forgiveness is one thing and stupidity is another!"" Righteous indignation focused upon vile criminals in the form of justifiable wrath and applied vengeance, is an inherent right! And if you feel the same, then you will love this movie. It is definitely a 'must see' and a keeper for your DVD collection. Nina Kish",1468886400,,3240,5.0

6520756,5,B00M0GM4DS,I enjoy stories with an enigmatic hero and this is an excellent example of that scenario. Denzel Washington is the perfect actor to carry this film and Antoine Fuqua is a director with great style who never disappoints IMO. The villain as portrayed by Marton Csokas rivals the talents of the hero making for an intense rivalry which keeps us guessing as to the final outcome. I am a fan of the original series and all too often the reboots don't work but this is definitely a pleasant exception and I found the pacing flawless with a fine film noir flavor. I watched the film a second time to study the framing and directorial approach which truly displays the talents of Mr. Fuqua making this one of my favorite films and one I will watch again.,1468713600,,746,4.492647058823529

6521323,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Do not peg me wrong, but anything Denzel Washington does is worth seeing, but this...an old tv series remade as a modern movie...a tv series that while it was a good idea, but the execution of said series was very poor to start with so let's face facts writers are running out of ideas for movies and are rehashing old tv series for possible movies and sticking big name stars in the roles to sell their revamped tv series / new movie . Denzel's star power makes it a passable movie, but if they changed more things in the transition from tv to movie it would have been a better movie, but it felt so boring in the first half of the movie trying to built a backstory to Denzel's character unlike the Book of Eli which was full of action and awesome characterizations because it was all new stuff, but Denzel's action in the Equalizer was good, but I found myself fast forwarding through the backstory to get to the action scenes. I would recommend this movie if you're a Denzel Washington fan, but if you are not a fan avoid this movie because out of sheer boredom.",1465430400,,1065,4.35678391959799

6521352,4,B00M0GM4DS,"I love a great action movie, and as soon as I saw that this was set in a big box home improvement store, I KNEW the denouement would take place there, with the hero using his wits (and various drills and nails) to outsmart the villains.  This turned out to be true, and it's a great set piece (although it doesn't take advantage of the particular setting as much as I'd hoped).

Denzel Washington plays a kindly (and brilliant) former op (with a touch OCD)  who is living a quiet life but is dragged back into the hero business by a chance meeting with an underage prostitute-  an aspect of the story line that is both too cute and too creepy.  Chloe Moretz' young hooker is either underwritten or mis-directed, as her scenes are mostly annoying.  But Washington's character can't stand by and watch her get hurt and the Russian mob that runs her turns out to be more dangerous and powerful than he anticipated.

Martin Csokas, who plays the super villain, is a GREAT actor, and the script tries (in vain) to give him some back story and dimension, but he's just fun to watch.

Antoine Fuqua isn't a brilliant action director on a par with Christopher McQuarrie but his scripts are workmanlike and his sense of place and pacing is masterful.  His movies are always fun.  (in a violent silly way)",1465257600,,1295,4.51931330472103

6522150,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Better than I thought it would be (if they'd followed the series more closely, it would have been a yawner for sure). Denzel Washington is a gifted actor that brings an atmosphere along with his massive presence that builds into the movies he makes and this one is no exception.

I liked it enough that I honestly hope they're considering a franchise (as long as Denzel agrees--if they replace him, all bets are off).

SPOILER ALERT: I thought the final fight was overlong and slightly overdone. Yes, you want an irresistible force to meet an immovable object--but I think if the bad guy had been shown to have grossly underestimated McCall, it would have played better. Sometimes a long fight scene as a climax just isn't necessary (unless, of course, you're pandering to the audience that requires it--then I guess you do what you gotta' do).",1461024000,,844,4.773972602739726

Denzel Washington has an excellent performance that is very believable and balanced.  There are some stretches towards the end, but those extremes provide the closure that makes the film feel complete.

This can also be thought of as a cross between an early Die Hard movie and the first Taken movie.  Lots of stereotypes employed to move the story along and clever tricks and twists that keep the movie from being predictable.",1459900800,,565,4.793814432989691

Unfortunately, he failed to bring the intensity that Edward Woodward brought to the role. Washington is always calm, even when killing people. Woodward would have felt remorse afterwards, and even felt guilty that he killed so easily. Washington appeared emotionless.

Robert is a terrible insomniac.  He befriends a Russian hooker at an all-night diner while he reads Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea.  The hooker, Alina, known as Teri, takes a trick she doesn't want.  She is beat by him and hits back making her pimps very upset.  They beat her near death putting her in the hospital.  Bob decides it's time to break out his personal can of Whoop-Ass to retaliate.

McCall is a combination of Charles Bronson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B009L7QO6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>&nbsp;Paul Kersey and Denzel's Eli from the 2010&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Eli/dp/B003KRJNBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Eli</a>.

The tension level throughout the movie is ""edge of seat"" and the special effects from the fight scenes is believable and captivating.

What I found refreshing about this is that the writers were unapologetic in their handling of the protagonist, because once he had his purpose, he marched straight through the story unencumbered by the typical Act 2 ""our hero starts to fall apart and needs resolution"" devices that can be super predictable.  Instead, he just keeps mowing people down as calm as can be, and takes us straight through to the dismantling of ""evil"" and then we're done.  Refreshing and fun.",1452902400,,519,4.7444444444444445

6522767,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I am compelled to write a review for this movie that will hopefully take you straight into the purchasing mode.  WOW you say, why does he think that it's that good?  Well it may have been my mood at the time, or that maybe it was pressing all my buttons for a great experience.

I like Denzel anyway even from his early action film days.  But I haven't followed everyone of his films for a while and I was missing him.  Then I caught the film Flight where he was a pilot and that was a different type of movie for him.  But back to this movie.

Some of his movies start out a little slow because of they're setting the stage and getting to know the characters in the story, but then something starts the action off and you know that its going in the right direction.  This movie was uncertain at first, but when I got a hint then I was hooked and everything from that point on was no disappointment.

In the end all the loose ends were tied up neatly and nicely in the proper bows with no storylines missing a conclusion.  That usually means that there is no way to have a sequel, but there is one little teaser for that to happen.

I know that some people out there will take this movie as being unreasonable for the abilities that the lead character has in order to stay out of trouble, but I liked the way it was handled in this case because I wanted the hero to have conclusive control of the situation(s) that happened.

I liked the way this movie progressed and ended too.  It made me very satisfied when it was done.",1452384000,,1523,4.1924398625429555

All his movies keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is coming next. And once again, no matter what kind of role he plays, good or bad guy, you just know he is going to be the hero.

6522802,4,B00M0GM4DS,I've always enjoyed watching movies with Denzel Washington acting in them but this movie was definitely not one of his best. It's not because of Washington but because of the story. The story was to quick and in my own opinion I thought they could've done better with a back story explaining he's previous years before.

6522804,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I have been putting off watching this because I was such a huge fan of the original TV Series and, while Denzel Washington is a fantastic actor I didn't really believe anyone could fill the late Edward Woodward's shoes. Back in the 80s he WAS McCall, Speaking of filling his shoes that was something Nicholas Cage failed to do in the remake of The Wicker Man. Not that I fault Mr. Cage for THAT what with The Wicker Man being such a freakin' weird story to begin with. You have to be familiar with Sir James George Fraser's THE GOLDEN BOUGH and/or Shirley Jackson's famous short story ""The Lottery"" or actor turned author Thomas Tryon's chilling novel HARVEST HOME to ""get it.""

But never mind all that. The point is that Mr. Washington has brought McCall back in Style! The entire cast give great performances but he...HE...really makes it work. He has made McCall an anti-hero for the 21st Century. Yes, an anti-hero. The things he does to people are sometimes cruel but he does them not only so that good people can live their lives without fear but even so that people who have taken the wrong path can have a second chance.
And he never gives up on the people he has chosen to help.

Mr. Washington...if you and the writers can come up with a decent script for a sequel I'd  be delighted to line up for a ticket!",1451520000,,1317,4.433884297520661

6522877,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I don't write long reviews for two reasons, most movies don't warrant them, and other people think highly enough of their opinions they cover that niche well enough there is no need for me to contribute.

I only point that out because I'd like to write a long review here and detail just how incredible I found this movie, especially for the genre it hails from. Action movies are an interesting breed, they can be engaging, from any number of perspectives, but ultimately the question is ""what was the body count?"" The Equalizer, is in my opinion, one of those rare action flicks that engages you on multiple levels and has a sizable body count. Denzel's character is as deep as he needs to be, you get the point, he was a bad man for the Government for a long time, he's a little older now, he's suffered some personal tragedy, and he's just trying to live a quiet life forgetting all that. But, sometimes you are faced with a situation you can't ignore, because you're the only one that cares enough to fix it.

That's the point here.

I really found it very interesting, because it's essentially a tale about how heroes never really quit being heroes, and the worst of us can use our experiences to the betterment of the world. Nearly every action film you see, is the young guy, fresh out of the academy, saving the world and winning the girl. Denzel's character I think is obviously that guy from many other movies, but 20-30 years later. After he got the girl, after he saved the world, after he was tired, after she died, after he just wanted to melt into obscurity. But the right situation calls him out again, he might not be the guy that saves the world anymore, but dismantling a single organization? Yeah, he can do that, and make it wonderfully entertaining.

I highly suggest this film, I'm usually not super smitten with action films, and tend to rate really good ones in the 3-4 star category depending on whether or not the selling point was combat or explosions. This has both of those, on top of great characters (who could have honestly used a little more depth, I would have liked it if they'd explained some of the Russian culture displayed on Teddy) and a lot of very concise, to the point violence, displayed by both the protagonist, and the antagonist, in ways that further display who they are.

He is able to actually become the character he is playing (very similar to the way he did with the character ""Alonzo"" in another great movie of his, Training Day). He seems to enjoy being ""The Equalizer"" and the quality shows throughout the movie. The supporting actors also play their stereotypes well and while this movie probably will not win any Oscars it is definitely an entertaining film.

October 12. 2015 Update Comment:  I have now watched The Equalizer three (3) times and noticed
more details in this excellently scripted movie.  If there was ever a movie which deserves a sequel,
The Equalizer is such a movie (story).  At the very end of this moving episodic story, Denzel looks
at his laptop computer screen. Sees another request from someone needing help, beyond what
police protection can offer.  Earlier in the movie, Denzel's former CIA retired friends comment that
he will never be happy to be married again, that his help for others is the only passion which he has.

6523238,4,B00M0GM4DS,"I used to watch the original television series The Equalizer, which this movie was based on, and Denzel Washington was the perfect person to recreate this story on the big screen. The character Washington played a wonderful balance of the very intelligent, calm but deadly type, who was trying to put his past working for the government as a lethal weapon, behind him.  He was trying to live a quiet, anonymous life, working in a big Home Depot-like store.  You see him at night, the man who lost his wife and is trying hard to keep the old life buried.  But his past is reawakened when he sees a young lady whom he sees regularly at a late night diner, and who is befriends, she is beaten within an inch of her life, as a result of the mobs hold on her as a prostitute.  And the beast within him is unleashed.  Great action!

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five has nothing to do with Denzel Washington's performance.  He is perfect in this role.  But the movie, like so many kick ass movies these days with all the big names like Bruce Willis, Liam Neison, Arnold and all the rest, is that the ending is just a giant explosion that looks like the 4th of July.  It is like the only thing Hollywood knows how to do anymore to end a action movie.  It is still a great movie, but it would have been far cooler in keeping with the Equalizer television series and with Denzel's character, if he had just quietly taken them all out and vanished.",1443312000,,1457,4.304029304029304

I wanted to share this new version of THE EQUALIZER with my grandchildren.  I had it all planned out with an overnight and popcorn etc.
Well, none of that will happen because of the atrociously extreme filthy language.  Over the top word after word to the point of actually being the entire dialogue of some scenes.  The profanity adds nothing to the plot, adds nothing to the scenes, adds nothing to anything.  Now I want you to understand that I don't go pale at the F bombs that occur in just about every movie that's made now days.  I was so disappointed!  There is no way I would allow anyone I know let alone my grands to see this movie.  I have deleted from my video library.  Denzel should really take no pride in this movie, although his acting was spot on.  Indeed he should be ashamed of having his name linked to to such trash.",1443052800,,1115,4.338164251207729

6523364,5,B00M0GM4DS,"This movie for Denzel Washington is like ""Jack Reacher"" was for Tom Cruz.  The theme of the movie is the tried and true action movie theme wherein a ""retired"" highly trained agent/operative/soldier/detective/etc. . . trying to cope with the demons from his past overcomes his PTSD by coming out of retirement to fight for those people who can't help themselves, usually little girls/old ladies/wrongly accused/etc. from the evil bad guys usually engaged in drugs/prostitution/gun running/slavery/patsy/scape goat/etc. . . through an ever escalating display of the ""special training"" to right the wrong.  If that theme appeals to you, this one is one of the best if seen.

Thus, for all those that have criticized the cliche theme of the movie, the movie is not the problem.  You are.  You either ignored the trailer  telling you what to expect or watched the trailer and were, idiotically disappointed that the advertisement for the movie delivered what it told you it would.  A piece of advice. Don't watch genres that your tired of or weren't really interested in at all.  If you do and then don't like it, it's your fault, not the movie makers.  Giving a low rating on  a move because of your ignorance just reinforces what you are

6523410,1,B00M0GM4DS,"This is a 'hate whitey' movie. It is also ridiculous.

Let's consider the ridiculous aspect first. Washington is a fine actor but his recent forays into the action star have been embarrassing. He's too old. He's too small. And he's insufficiently athletic. Consider that the original Equalizer Edward Woodward player the role as a white haired retired agent. But Woodward was five years younger in real life when he played this part. He had a heart attack and retired from the screen before he was ever as old as Washington is here.

Wikipedia claims that he is six one. If so then every other man else in this film is at least six four. He's always the smallest man in the frame. But some other actions stars like Jet Li, Chuck Norris or Jason Statham are all small. True but they can actually move. They were all former athletes. Each is credible as a fighter. Washington only decided to become a screen fighter when he became very old. I think he began to play the invincible fighter in that whacky post apocalyptic film 'The Book of Eli' where is is some kind of Christian Zatoichi.

Washington is 60 - unless he's lying about his age the way he lies about his height. He looks like a man in his sixties and moves like a man in his sixties.  Age catches up with us all but if you are sensible you adjust the characters you play.  John Wayne got old on the screen but when he was about Washington's age he played Rooster Cogburn in True Grit - as a old fat man. He was great. Washington still tries to portray a hero of thirty and he can be convincing as long as he stays completely still.

Real action stars are photographed in full frame. You can see their whole figure in the action sequences at normal speed. But when they get old, overweight and creaky like Steven Segal the camera moves in too close, the cuts are too jumpy, and action is speeded up. In this film Washington is photographed from a normal distance until we get to an action sequence. Then the camera is right on top of him. We can't see much of him anymore. The camera comes in real close there are a lot of bangs and thuds in the sound track and when the camera pulls back again - Denzel has vanquished another bigger younger guy. You never actually see him fight.

It's just as well that we can't see anymore of him. He wipes out vast crowds of villains by barely touching them.  The fight sequences are particularly absurd. In the first one he enters unarmed into a room with five bad guys some of whom have knives and other guns. The guy with the gun is behind him. But Washington doesn't bother protect himself from these experienced mobsters all of whom are half his age. He doesn't try to maneuver so as to achieve some advantage. In fact he continuously sets up situations in which he is at a complete disadvantage.

Then he quickly kills the bad guys who often have automatic weapons with something that is just lying around within reach. So if he is fighting a young professional killer armed with a machine gun Washington will dispatch him with a bottle opener.  Such a confrontation might be believable if Denzel did it once. But Washington defeats grown men who carry assault rifles when he only has a hand tool. He does this over and over again. They are have guns but he refuses to use a gun. He goes into battle with some random hand tool.

In the original Equalizer, McColl carried a Walher PPK like James Bond. Sometimes he picked up a Desert Eagle in .50 caliber. In this loony movie he goes into battle with a popsicle stick.

This shtick is so crazy that you have to laugh.

Now let's consider the racial message.

The original Equalizer (as I remember) was a middle aged British guy who was a former secret agent who was enlivening his retirement by being a private detective who also is a kind of vigilante. He was of course white. He seemed innocuous which allowed him to maneuver a situation such that he could prevail in some showdown. But he didn't resolve problems with his fists against men half his age. He used strategy not Kung Fu.

They go to some effort to make Washington seem smart. There is a running storyline about reading one hundred books. Washington and the black director of this movie don't seem to read much. I read about two books a week. That's a hundred books a year - every year. And I've done that for fifty years. Bill O'Reilly says he reads three books a week. Many white people do. Someone who has only read a hundred books in their whole life is a functional illiterate.

His character also plays chess like Michael Jai White in 'Blood and Bone'.  This seems to be a new clich. Michael Jai White is a formidable looking black guy. I could believe that this big, massively muscle athlete could indeed beat up several opponents. But not old, chubby and creaky Denzel Washington.

The first crime depicted in this movie is pimping and the exploitation of prostitutes. But in the movie the pimps are white and the rescuer in the black guy. Just like in real life - right?. Washington is depicted as super neat and organized white the white guys are fat and slovenly. The whites are all vicious and treacherous. The black hero is a saint that every one trusts and respects.

So the black character is noble, well organized, and trusted. While the whites are vicious, stupid, ineffective and silly.

That's what I like - a movie with a message.",1441152000,5,5367,4.468302658486707

This movie starts slowly but it gets really good. The action is continuous and violent. Denzel Washington plays Bob and he does a great job in the role.

The danger in this movie is that MY 65-year old behind, after watching it [three times] could barely resist the urge to go out and FIND some people to try [TRY!!] to beat up, stab, blow up, torture, and kill--with as BLANK a face that I could muster up.  I'm exaggerating, of course [NOTE TO HOMELAND SECURITY].  But, anyone over 50, after viewing this movie, should BEWARE!!  It's just a MOVIE, not a PRESCRIPTION!!

One of the best aspects of the character is the psychological struggle he suffers, which you can see right at the beginning of the movie, though you don't know what he's struggling WITH.  He is torn, and he's suffering, for some reason [You find out later!]  That struggle eventually comes to an end, when he finally faces WHO HE IS, and settles with that, with the help of some friends and mentors.

But, it takes a while, as you see when, after ending the lives of some bad guys, he sits on the floor, his back against a wall, his face twisted in regret.  And, while bodies are all around him, BLEEDING TO DEATH, he mumbles, ""I'm sorry.""  LOL!!!!  The FUNNY thing is that, he MEANS it.

It's a real, old-fashioned HERO movie, except that he AIN'T the Lone Ranger type.  He's a bit more...ahem...aggressive.  The young woman that plays the prostitute should have received an academy award [maybe she did--or will, I don't keep up with that].  It is almost impossible to believe that she's barely 19 years old, as I recall reading somewhere. She's GENIUS, like Denzel.

The bad guys are...well....REALLY bad!!  The actors are superb, and you DO NOT regret when they lose an eye, or suffer a drill bit THROUGH the back of their heads.

Let me tell you how good this movie is.  I went to see it alone, because my wife CANNOT watch violent, bloody, gory movies.  When I got back home, I was raving about it.  She goes, ""Well...I don't know...Maybe I'll go see it with you.  But, I'm NOT going to watch anything gory!!  I'll close my eyes, or just go out in the lobby.""

NOT!!  Man, we get to the movie, right?  Okay, and Denzel's doing his thing, taking out [in the most BRUTAL manner] the bad guys.  At one point, when something absolutely horrendous occurs to a bad guy, my wife shouts, LOUDLY, ""YEAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

Whoa!!  I turned to her, and she was literally on the edge of her seat, and jabbing her fist in the air!!  I'd made a monster.  More correctly, DENZEL had made a monster!!  Now THAT kind of acting is DANGEROUS!!  Scarry dude, that Denzel!!  If you haven't seen it, do so.  Purchase it!",1439769600,,2578,4.578947368421052

6523669,3,B00M0GM4DS,"The best scene in this film is flawed, in fact makes no sense, and that pretty much sums up the movie.

The scene: the bad guy -- and he's a real good bad guy -- is outside Washington's apartment door. Washington opens the door, he knows exactly who this guy is, knows that, eventually, it's going to come down to killing this guy: so why not kill him then and there? He bvisouly has the advantage -- even has the high ground. Yes, I know, why did Hamlet delay... so there could be a play. But the Washington of the film -- CIA assassin -- would have killed the guy on the spot.

And the security-guard-wannabe scenes are so poor, so unconvincing, it's as if they were spliced in from a different film.",1437955200,,702,4.2706766917293235

Mr. Fuqua is a very good director, and paired up with Denzel, he seems to bring the best out of him as an actor. My favorite part of the movie is the song choice and how it plays at alternating volume levels during the hardware store showdown.

6523831,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Let's start and put the ""action"" and well done violence aside. The film is meditation on a man -thankfully played by Washington. What a treat. The film is shot beautifully, and at a pace by which we get to know his character well, solemnly, and for much of the film's time. Before Denzel even speaks the first line of the movie, you know more about him than most characters in Hollywood roles. The economy of the shots, subtle precursors, and concentration on Denzel's ""normal"" life comes through with tight writing (much is easy to quote and righteously remembered for sure). Something poignant & wise need not be always through long torment, or self-mocking drama. Nor do movies of redemption thru force have to constantly pummel you over the head and burn your eyes. Enduring parables are often classic for the succinct & generally fair moral/s they impart, simple and smart, but it's not easy to achieve. Even-handed symbolism (and wonderful maxims) written & directed, are all clear yet but not abused. The economy of the film give us full-time access to Denzel as his character learns to honor his own sturdy truth & awakening. It's clear Denzel allowed himself to appear old, slight paunch, and conservative. His commitment to the character is so clear and clean and devoted.
Now, you put in those actually brief & inspired (artfully done) moments of action, and the audience is taken ass-total.
John Wick/Taken 1,2,3 may be in the same category as movies, but The Equalizer will be the artful classic.
BTW, 'The Equalizer' has a damn-stellar supporting cast too!",1436054400,2,1570,4.906015037593985

6523911,4,B00M0GM4DS,"'Robert McCall' (Denzel Washington) has long since left his past life behind him, he now works in a D.I.Y store leading a
anonymous life these days.
He often visits a local Diner attended frequently by 'Teri' (Chloe Grace Moretz) who's life appears to be controlled by
Russian Mobsters/Gangsters.
'McCall' notices she gets hit around some by either clients or and her Russian-Masters.......when she lands up in Hospital,
'McCall' seeks out the Russians and offers to buy her out of their clutches, his gesture is rejected, guess they should have
taken the $9800 when offered.
'McCall' will use his deadly skills if he needs to do so despite promising his now departed wife he'd not do so, and that he'd
never be that person again.
He will soon learn that his earlier problem-solving actions are just the beginning, the faces may have changed, but for the
Russians, it's business as usual, and they will seek to even the score.
Things get pretty intense when the Russians try to exploit 'McCall's weak spot.
Brilliantly entertaining no-nonsense and gritty settle-the-score, even-the-odds movie containing several brutal sequences along
with a measure of compassion and humour.
'Denzel Washington' is a cool operator as 'McCall' --Great Role

6523965,5,B00M0GM4DS,"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!! DENZEL WASHINGTON IS SUPERB IN THIS ACTION THRILLER!!!! One of the greatest attributes to watching a great movie, is trying to figure out each sequence and the story line, before and as the plot thickens and expands. This movie has more twists and turns than the best of roller coasters, but has a storyline, that you can watch over and over again and find something you may have missed before!!! Denzel is the greatest actor out there, but I love how they down-played his character this time. He holds no special high political office, nor does he wear a cop's badge this time. He is not playing an evil or corrupt individual, but is portrayed as an ordinary citizen just trying to live life...much like we do, without high stress or confrontation.

BUT...when faced with those high lever stressful situations...well then...OH BOY, THE FIREWORKS BEGIN!!! They may be short bursts of fireworks, or can be a long involved set of fireworks. Just stayed glued to your seats, when the action starts, because you won't be prepared for how he handles each and every situation individually!!!

At my studio,[a special area dedicated to Heigh Definition Sound & Image],I have screened ""EQUALIZER""[a simple way to thanks my friend and his gift]. The disc menu indicates ""DTS HD Master 7.1 ch."",and the Portuguese Sub-title was selected,and them Play... A whole new meaning to the term  reality started,and the Entertainment begins. About the movie,a lot has being said in many reviews, but about the disc mastering audio quality/reality is astonishing,it takes you THERE !  I use 4 ceiling channels/enclosures that are full range ones + Sub Woofer, and 4 ceiling full range ch.related to surround and sur.back ch.,that are part of ceiling information.  So,front stage is composed by left-center-right+2 ceiling[not Height] :middle stage is surround left and right + center ceiling thats includes the subwoofer,the back stage uses surround back left/right and back ceiling[center].  Old guy have ideas against all odds,and a lot of calculations to make it works well according to DTS HD MASTER 7.1 +Ceiling Channels,and other Multidirectional channels systems, Note: I have designed this home theater about 3 years ago,after have seeing Imax 3D experience [Real D 3D].  By the way,I use a front projector leveled and horizontally properly placed to avoid keystone and a fixed flat screen with 50 inches [constant height] with an aspect ratio from 133:1 till 2,40:1[about 10 feet wide] adjusted by a pair of black curtains along side. PS. the sub-title,is corrected positioned over the image,not over the black border : just like the 3D versions. VERY GOOD ! [OPPO Blu-ray players can correct this]  I have notice about 3D Sound by Amazon,and the ""GRAVITY"" DIAMOND LUXE EDITION,that's under analyses by the moment... So,it was very unusual manner to be in front of a really 3D sound demonstration without any advertising to promotion purpose. What good surprise to this movie buff.

Denzel is the level-headed, super-smart, neighborly brotha who does all manor of favors for his uber-diverse co-workers. He even befriends a Russian hooker-with-heart-of-gold who can't stop getting beat up by her White pimps, he helps catch a White stick-up man (is that even a thing?) who steals his Puerto Rican co-worker's jewelry, and goes after a couple of White cops who shake down his Mexican-friend's-mom's taco stand....not making this up.
Finally, the Russian gangsters abusing his would-be Russian gal-pal find out the hard way that its only been his kindly nature that has kept him from breaking their White necks at will. Denzel, don't even need a gun, he uses hammers, ash trays, and staplers...and does it all for time!

6524156,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I bought a ticket to this film on Friday, the day it opened:  My wife was out of town on business, I liked the TV series, and the film started at the right time.  I bought a ticket to this film on Saturday, the next day.  A few days later, I was on a plane to New York City on business of my own.  I watched this film again, not once, but twice.  Bottom line, this is a film that Denzel was born to make and if you see it once, then you will see it a thousand times.  It's not the story or the action.  It's the character that Denzel creates.  He fits the part so beautifully and brings so many interesting dimensions to the character.  He is constantly confronting the bad guys to ""Do the right thing!"" as if they don't understand that they are causing bad things to happen to good people.  This reminds me of Socrates.  He also believed that no one would do evil once they understood that they are doing bad things because evil is as harmful to the criminal as it is to the victim.  One of the final scenes in which Denzel kills the Russian crime czar in his own mansion is brilliant.  All we see are twisted bodies everywhere.  Everything else is left to our imagination.  It takes courage to film an action scene like this, but it is so much more effective and compelling: ""My mind to me a kingdom is.""  Denzel has created a character that it a little bit of Jesus, a little bit of Siddhartha, and a little bit of Robin Hood.",1433030400,,1429,4.141818181818182

6524178,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Want to sink into your couch/loveseat/recliner and watch a film that you've already seen a thousand times in a variety of other incarnations? You're in luck, this is a film you're going to enjoy. There is nothing I can think of in this film that is anything remotely original but nevertheless I enjoyed it for what it was.
The Protagonist happens to be a former government agent with a lethal skill set and some killer dance moves, who after a murky tragedy has chosen to lead a simple spartan lifestyle of solitude and now indulges his more friendly virtues for work-friends (because having real friends would be too painful or summthin).
And then... he befriends a local street rat and involves himself in something sinister and violent after a brief wrestling with the consequences of his actions and enters into a deadly game of cat and mouse where others may pay the painful consequences for his altruistic actions. You may thrill at the final showdown between him and his evil doppelganger while the only people he kinda might like are caught in the crossfire, but you probably won't.
Tbh, at this point I think you can pretty well determine exactly where this movie is going, where it went and how it all ends but if you like yourself some porno-esque storylines with some pretty decent action sequences and a fairly enjoyable performance by the two leads with some pretty good humor, then really you should watch this.
But seriously, if you haven't seen this yet for some reason you may want to check out John Wick first, if for some reason you haven't seen that film yet either. They both came out roughly the same time, have very similar themes but John Wick has better action sequences imo. Also... they both have dark-clothed men holding guns on a rainy night with what looks to be exactly the same shade of blue behind them. Whatever you go with, sit back, relax, eat some *insert favorite comfort food* and enjoy mindless action sequences from a hero you can cheer for.",1432857600,,1983,4.7011494252873565

While there are many changes in detail the retelling of the story is very faithful to the character or Robert McCall. Denzel Washington's pertail as McCall as a retired 'next level' operative was outstanding as most of his work is. Not the typical action hero.

6524337,4,B00M0GM4DS,"hey all
this is going to be one of those good news bad news reviews first the good things about the Blu-ray
The good
first off I enjoyed the movie, it harkens back to the old vigilante movies like the Death wish series. Denzel plays Robert McCall very good Chloe moretz plays Teri the person who starts Robert on his path, and Nicolai the person who is out to kill Robert is truly terrifying. Many of the scenes are well done and while it does take a little bit to get started once it does, it is paced out and gives the movie life. This is a great movie and the special features are ok

The bad
Earlier I said the special feature are ok, which is true but there should have been more for blu ray. you get the standard fare. features about studying to play the characters, fight training, learning about the character, and behind the scenes featurette. For a blu ray there should have been more. Maybe I am spoiled by marvel movie but I believe that if we are going to spend another 4 or five dollars they could have given us some delted scenes or a little bit extra something.

Final verdict
Still this is a good movie, and while the special features are good to watch they are the only thing holding this movie Blu-ray back from being a great pack",1431561600,,1249,4.265822784810126

6524345,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, a man living quietly in a small apartment and working at a place similar to Home Depot. His background is secret, but we learn that he is retired Intelligence agent. He is an insomniac, which leads him to frequent an all night coffee shop and meet an eastern European girl being forced into prostitution by the Russian Mafia. There is plenty of violent action as Robert McCall deals with these creeps. This is much heavier than the TV series the starred Edward Woodward.
McCall is a master planner and gets his revenge in many clever ways. None of his enemies survive their encounters with him.
Michael Sloan, the creator of ""The Equalizer"" TV series, is also involved in the production of this film version.",1431475200,,747,4.7984496124031

6524373,4,B00M0GM4DS,"If you're expecting anything resembling ""The Equalizer"" TV show from the 80s then you're likely to be disappointed. As with every other remake out there, the action is amped up 200%, the plot is basic and the storytelling is minimal. That being said, I didn't watch the movie expecting a drama-based action film with mind blowing plot twists.

I was looking for a fun, action flick for pizza-night and I wasn't disappointed",1431388800,,423,4.875

""Taken"" style movies where one man takes it upon himself to hold a ton of criminals accountable for mistreating one person they saw as insignificant.

6524376,3,B00M0GM4DS,"I'm going to start all my movie reviews this way, because I think it's the most useful to people deciding whether to see the movie.  I'm not writing a detailed opinion on the movie, I will instead list movies I liked, movies I didn't like, and movies that were just OK.  I will try to pick mostly mainstream movies of multiple genres from mostly recent years.  In this way, I'm hoping people will ignore my opinion and instead get a feel for whether the movie is for them or not.  Besides, this is what reviews are for correct?  To see if it is something YOU would like to see :-)

For my general opinion,  the movie was kind of weak.  The plot was pretty dumb, even by my non-super plot requiring standards.  Acting was fine and action was just OK.

Movies I like-All fast and furious, All Marvel, All New Batman Post 2000, Frozen, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Role Models, The Mummy, Stardust, All LOTR, 1408, Haunting in Connecticut, Avatar, Black Swan, Source Code, All the Harry Potters, Tangled, All bond From Casino Royale Forward, First three Pirates of the Caribbean, Kings Speech, District 9, The Social Network, Pitch Perfect

Movies that were just OK-Alice in Wonderland, Buried, Billy Madison, Couples Retreat, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Crank, GI Joe, Hancock, I Am Legend, Priest, Into the Woods,Rain Man, Wanted, The new Total Recall, 22 Jump Street (Credits Very Funny though), Lucy, The Purge, Man of Steel, Limitless, Wolf of Wall street, Devil, The Fighter,

Movies that I Hated- Inglorious Bastards, Kill Bill (All of them), Burn After Reading, Be Kind Rewind, Bridesmaids, Hannah, Prometheus, True Grit (the new one), The Good Shepard, Horrible Bosses, Paul Blart Mall Cop, The Happening, Red, The Other Guys, Watchmen, Brave, Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Pirates of the Caribbean: on Stranger Tides, Night crawler, The Grey, Bad Teacher.

6524477,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Another action movie from Denzel Washington, with Chloe Grace Moretz as the damsel in distress.

 Denzel's character leads a solitary and very quiet life.  The script never does fill in exactly what he did for a living before, but obviously it must have been something very violent, like a Navy SEAL.  After the loss of his wife, he retired from all that and in the beginning of the movie we see him reading a lot.  [Possible mild spoiler alerts]  As he later explains to that damsel in distress, it's because his wife had been reading from a list of the top 100 books you should read in your life.  He had always intended to read them himself, ""someday"", so they'd have things to discuss when he retired.  Now she's unexpectedly gone, he decides to read them himself (hoping maybe to discuss them with her in heaven or something?  Anyhow, for an ex-SEAL (or whatever) clearly this is going to get boring.  So, when a local prostitute who tends to frequent the same late-night diner he does gets beat up by her pimp, Denzel finds himself unable to resist trying to find and rescue her, or failing that, to at least extract revenge on people who use women in such a fashion.

We know the familiar arc of such action films.  The hero, somewhere around mid-film, has to find himself captured and his life in grave jeopardy--
then miraculously to escape from defeat and save the day.  Yeah--that doesn't happen here.  Perhaps Denzel simply didn't want to play a character
in such a vulnerable position, or perhaps the script already had it laid out that way, but he always manages somehow, to stay one step ahead of the
bad guys (of which there are many).  He lends credibility to the non-violent scenes, like when he's talking to Chloe, and he lends credibility to
the fight scenes.  The one thing I'd fault him for is, when directly confronting the worst bad-guys, his face just doesn't look like someone ruthless enough to maim or kill with no emotion (the way they would).  Without revealing what happens with the original damsel in distress (Chloe Moretz, whom I'd never seen in a film before, although she's been in a few), as this movie wraps up we find Denzel's life re-organized yet again.  Instead of
spending all his time reading his wife's top 100 books, he's clearly decided to use his skills in one of those Batman-type jobs: you know, the
outside-the-law protector of the weak and exploited.  Perhaps that's revealing too much, but the interest that this film generates is not so much in
where he ends up as in the process of getting there.  That process was interesting enough that I found myself watching the whole film non-stop

Other than that, it's a story of one man who realizes he has the power to hold the prepetrators accountable for their actions.

6524509,5,B00M0GM4DS,"We're not sure what Denzel's character did before coming to work at a Home Depot - type store, but at one point in the film, the word ""Agency"" is mentioned, and that explains a lot. His character, ""Bob"", or ""Robert"" , is a man who misses nothing. He's always watching his surroundings, like a hawk, and when a situation arises, he times himself with a stopwatch feature on his watch.  You get the feeling that even though he's not involved in matters of international espionage anymore, he's constantly stretching himself and refining  the survival skills that he does have to a razor sharp point. Combining  cinematography, editing and scoring, director Antoine Fuqua gives us an artistically - shot ""ballet of violence and destruction""  , backed by the superb script and acting skills of all involved.  An added bonus is that although the ""bad guys"" use the ""F"" word every other sentence,  Bob never does - his detached emotions and incredible skills put him above the common street thugs he goes up against, and endears him to us even more.  This is a good, solid thriller which I saw as a rental, and then immediately purchased a copy for myself.",1430352000,,1150,4.748743718592965

6524572,3,B00M0GM4DS,"The Equalizer is a movie about a secret agent who decided to leave the game, but wants to help those around him in need. It was originally a series in the 80's and has a book that was released around the same time as the movie. It has a lot in common with the TV show Burn Notice, except the agent in burn notice was forced out while McCall simply quit.

I read almost the entire book before seeing the movie. I was disappointed to discover that the book does not follow the movie. In fact, the two had very little in common.

Movie: Very slow to start off. It took almost half an hour for things to finally pick up. The first section of the movie goes to great lengths to show the normalcy of McCall. The director gave subtle hints that something was different about him (apartment devoid of furnishings or pictures, strange extended stares, odd behaviors, etc.). This part of the movie easily could have been reduced to 10 or 15 minutes without altering the plot one iota.

Fights- There are three main fights in the movie.

1. McCall vs a room full of Russian thugs, maybe 6 total. He manages to disarm and eliminate all of them in under 30 seconds (extremely impressive) without walking into the room with a weapon. He uses his acquired ""skills"" to utilize nearby items for his fighting advantage. Pretty unbelievable, but a well orchestrated scene. Probably the most graphic of all the fights, almost to the point of overkill (no pun intended).

2. McCall being chased by the Russian assassin and his associates. They know he is extremely dangerous but have no idea about his training. They speculate, but cannot find any supporting information. This scene is more of a fight for his survival than anything. Sure his enemies have him cornered and know where he lives, but McCall is too resourceful to simply roll over and give up. He manages to take out a few random associates and escapes from harm.

3. The final scenes of the movie, when the Russian assassin and mercenaries stop by McCall's place of employment (Lowe's/Home Depot type store). McCall sets up several traps for the men while managing to save the innocent hostages. I couldn't help but think this scene resembled the Home Alone pranks, but for adults and much more violent/graphic in nature. He slowly weeds their numbers down until only a few remain. As you can probably guess, McCall is the only one who walks out of the store.

How does it compare to the book? It was entertaining to watch, but the movie went after the solo hero approach rather than a cast of characters. In the book, he calls on people from his past life to help him with his missions. These include Kostmayer, a gung ho ready young bunk; granny, a chess playing maniac ready to back up McCall as needed; and Brahms, an intel genius who owns a computer/surveillance store. This approach recognizes that one person would have shortcomings and need to rely on others to achieve their objectives. The movie had McCall visit one person from his past ""for permission"", she really didn't even provide anything beneficial to his situation. That whole scene felt like filler.

Being about 80% through the book, I think it would have made a better story for the movie. With the zany cast of characters, it could have easily turned into several movies. They were probably afraid of the movie being a flop or how long it would take to introduce his ""friends"" into the picture.

I was a little put off by the advertising of the movie. Before reading the book I thought McCall was a random guy that helped total strangers. All of the people he helped were more in the acquaintance category, not total strangers. The previews made it seem like people would contact ""The Equalizer"" with a description of their problems and he would help solve them with his talents. Sort of like ""The Mechanic"", minus the monetary exchange. The movie sort of ended like this with McCall answering a Craigslist type ad, but it felt misleading and left a bad taste in my mouth about the film.",1429833600,,4003,4.618846694796062

My only issue with The Equalizer comes from the fact that Denzel Washington's character is fundamentally indistinguishable from his role in Man On Fire, essentially the same background can be extrapolated from both characters. This could easily be thought of as having been an alternate reality lived out by the same person in both movies.
Having enjoyed Man On Fire a great deal, it is a bit disappointing to see what amounts to little more than a retread with different antagonists. Sure, the motivations that set events in motion are different, but that is really about the only other change.
Still an enjoyable and satisfyingly violent movie, but it loses points for a blatant lack of originality in having Washington cast in what amounts to the same role he was already successful with in a better movie. Also, there was really no need for this particular movie to be more than two hours long. Also, it lost a step or two from the original television series.
Worth seeing, but it has been done before and better.",1429315200,,1243,4.6289592760181

Hello..if u r able 2 see my usage of Amazon, u'll understand I'm quite new.to Amazon Prime and movies even more recent, and am using the movies very less cuz of malfunctions.
Have been with Netflix and was so interested 2 b with u 2 expand the selections...BUT am seriously disappointed with, I believe , some serious glitches in yr view accessibility after a movie has been boughtn, rented, etc.
Even tonite , Extremely frustrating 2 leave the room , having Bought the movie but having different kinds of  hassles 2 proceed where I left off...even after 10 min!
So far , 4 or 5 times with The Equalizer, every time I start 2 watch again,  the movie starts All Over Again!!
It's called Content error-retry. Here we go all the way back to the absolute beginning.
Pls try 2 find the problem.
Actually, have mostly gone back 2 Netflix as every movie I 've bought or rented has some difficulty.

If you liked early Eastwood (Dollars - I never saw the Dirty Harry series), later Eastwood (Unforgiven - near the end), and what turned into the adult version of Home Alone (once the would-be burglars arrived), you will love this flick. I could've watched this movie 'til the cows came home. I've no idea if this movie is based on that old book series, but it's a winner from beginning to end. The invincible guy with a heart of gold. I'm so glad the great Denzel still had enough spring in his step to pull this off with some believability, despite the utter absurdity of the things he manages to do.

My only complaint is that the climax occurs in relative darkness. My TV doesn't handle dark well.

6524922,3,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington doesn't star in bad movies.  (The one I've liked the least is his Academy Award winning ""Training Day""--but that's me.)  Therefore, this is not a bad movie.  It takes the popular TV series of the last quarter of the 20th century with the same name and turns it into an action movie of the first quarter of the 21st.  Instead of the debonair Edward Woodward, a retired secret agent, we've got Washington quietly working in a big hardware and lumber store like Home Depot and keeping pretty much to himself.  Whatever his past--we aren't ever quite sure--it doesn't take long for us to know that he has special skills that he is hesitant to use.  We also learn that you can push a man too far.  Taking pity on a 'lady of the night' he brings the wrath of a gang of really mean Russian Mafia guys on him and even on the people he works with.  Bodies of the evil are soon strewn throughout including the big hardware store. (Have you ever wondered how many CSI we would need if all those bodies were real?)  But that's not the point.  The point is, that's what we do in the 21st century--lots of bullets and I'll bet more bodies than the whole '80's ""Equalizer"" series of 88 episodes.  Even so, I still get more turned on by Robin Hood or Zorro or that  super vigilante Charles Bronson in the ""Death Wish"" series.",1427846400,,1327,4.39344262295082

6524967,4,B00M0GM4DS,"The Equalizer was one of the most underrated shows of the 1980s, it was a great show, but it always lacked a certain intensity that the lead character needed. In this 2014 film adaptation of the series, Director, Antoine Fuqua, made sure that didn't happen again. Denzel Washington stars and can play anyone, but I find he's at his best when he's playing a dark loner like Robert McCall. McCall, a former CIA operative has retired and is attempting to live a normal life. Everything is going as planned, until he sees a young girl being abused, and decides to take action. McCall believe he's just going up against a local pimp, but discovers it's a lot more complicated than that. Washington continues to be at the top of his game, as the ageless wonder is once again spectacular. This film is everything I loved about the series, with a whole lot more action and intensity. Director, Antoine Fuqua, has been on a role after films like Training Day, Shooter, and Olympus Has Fallen, and he has become THE guy when it comes to action films. Playing off an established franchise and paired with Denzel Washington, The Equalizer has come back to life and is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes with a different team, what was once old, can become new again, and I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. As far as the continuation of the series goes, Fuqua is in the early stages of a sequel. It may not be a new TV series, but it's still something exciting for the fans, and I for one can't wait to see more.",1427673600,2,1563,4.487719298245614

6525030,1,B00M0GM4DS,"Hmmm... ""Equalizer""... That name sounds familiar.  That couldn't refer to the wonderful Eighties urban crime series starring Edward Woodward, could it?  Technically, it could.  Director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington (Training Day) have combined to create a revenge fantasy which has more in common with the ""Death Wish"" films than the television series.  Those who fondly remember the latter will probably turn on their heels and walk out the door as soon as they see what has become of it.

This film could have been more accurately entitled: ""Gunfight at the Home Depot,"" since Washington's superspy-turned-hardware clerk chooses to wipe out the Russian Mafia row by row there.  With the help of a bargain-rent Paul Blart Mall Cop, his Robert McCall uses a variety of Weed Whackers, lawn mowers, fertilizer bombs, ad nauseum to dispatch the poor Slavs.  Having eradicated the Russian Mafia on the East Coast (Who cares about the West?)  he goes to Russia to slaughter battalions more.  Somehow, he fails to pop up on the International Space Station to wrestle a wayward Cosmonaut.  He does pay a price however; he scraped his knee - twice.

Perhaps the problem here is generational; if you like Denzel Washington, go see this.  If you remember the old series fondly... avoid this at all costs.",1427414400,10,1306,5.023255813953488

6525358,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Fantastic Denzel movie. At first I was expecting a straightforward action ride which this is but with more story and background development than your typical ""shoot'em up"" picture. You get to see the main character (Denzel) as a normal guy who is like a lot of people living their lives but not really achieving their full potential or ""true calling"" so to speak. Once our character realizes what he is meant to do and decides to jump into the fray rather than just be on the sidelines the bullets start to fly. Very bloody and graphic movie. Think of ""Man on Fire"" times 10. From different articles I've read this is supposed to become a franchise of movies. I hope so because Denzel plays this role perfectly and oddly enough he has never had a franchise/series of movies. Buy it now!",1426982400,2,786,4.581560283687943

6525389,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Its vital to enter into this film dropping expectations of the original Equaliser series, which was a far more mild mannered affair.  The emphasis in this movie is much more on the vengeance and death than kindness and support but it drives along so efficiently and with a typically engaging performance from Washington, that the Death Wish similarities can be easily forgiven.
Mood in first half builds Washingtons tone and character, as we see a solitary and private man who clearly has compassion and cares for the security of those around him.  His conversations in his night time venue of a quiet 24 hour diner with Chloe Grace Moretz character are a satisfying slow build into his world.  As things progress and he is compelled to mete out his own form of justice (normally using various tools from the hardware store where he works..), the movie changes into a more grim vengeance themed tone as the deadly skills from Washingtons pre-hardware store career are given full reign.  Its the most exploitational movie I can recall Washington take on, but he still brings his trademark humanity to the role helping make what could have been hard to swallow actually an enjoyable journey to take.
The action is brutal and exciting, but while ably and efficiently depicted in a kinetic style, it doesnt feel truly like anything we haven't seen before.  Even the baddies are the current Hollywood stalwart  Russian mob.  That said, the final showdown has some of the more inventive ways of despatching bad guys than have been seen for a while.
No classic then, but pretty enjoyable nonetheless, and if they do a sequel, Ill be in line.

In it Denzel was a retired spy who'd obviously made a promise to his deceased wife that he would stay out of the spy game, but broke that promise when he saw someone in trouble.  He's a stand-up guy.  A guy with specialized skills.  The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  The supporting cast was good.

6526395,5,B00M0GM4DS,"First Off, I am a big fan of Denzel, the man is just a great actor, and being that he is a top notch guy in real life it is just hard not to love the man. This movie is a breath of fresh air in my opinion. As we all know, basically starting in the early 2000's we hit a stride, which has stayed with us, that all movies have to be as realistic as possible, especially when they are action flicks. Gone are the 80's over the top action, with cheesy one liners and explosive packed construction, where everything will go up in a ball of flames.
But this movie is a perfect nod, albeit not as cheesy, to the old 80's action. We have a man with a veiled history, who was obviously someone special in the kicking ass department earlier in his life. Insert reason to take this back up, and bang you have a movie about a good guy, kicking the bad guys into the grave. You have a clear good guy, with clear bad guys, the story isn't bogged down by too much, but at the same time we are given enough that we feel the right emotions towards the right characters. This movie is just a lot of fun!
Now don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the realist approach to movies which is so common now-a-days, but lets face it, Modern Action, is just Modern Day Myth, and sometimes you just have to let go of the notion of ""how is this possible"" and just enjoy the herculean glory that is a indomitable protagonist!

6526526,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Good action film.  The only quarrel I have with it, is why he would not pick up a perfectly good rifle with a night-vision scope, in the dark, to fight bad guys, who all have rifles with night-vision scopes, just so he can use improvised weapons, i.e. there was no other bad guy firing at him at that moment, to prevent him from picking it up, no empty mags, etc, to explain it.  It's cool, but illogical.  The movie was slow to get started, but once started, it was good action, other than that one flaw.  Denzel and Chloe Grace Moretz were good, as usual. How about an Equalizer/Hit Girl crossover?",1425254400,,600,4.378378378378378

6526610,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Over the past few years the children of the 70s and 80s have taken to heart the shows that they grew up with and turned them into full length feature films. Some have been good, some bad and many mediocre. In some cases it shows a lack of creativity, a longing by studios looking to make good on their investments rather than come up with something new or inventive. But then on occasion a movie takes its start from the past, puts a new spin on it and makes it something altogether new. Such is the case with THE EQUALILZER.
If you remember the hit series from the past just know you won't find the exact same thing here. Yes, the heros name is Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) and yes he did used to work for some clandestine organization, perhaps the CIA. But rather than retire with plenty of cash on hand, this McCall faked his death and makes a living working at a big box hardware store. There he has plenty of friends, many that he tries to help in any way he can like fellow co-worker Ralphie who is trying to lose weight and get in shape to become a security guard for the store. Its a simple life where no violence accompanies his day to day life.
But McCall has his problems such as sleeping through the night. To pass the time he visits a nearby diner and reads while there. It is here that he makes the acquaintance of Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young prostitute who works for a Russian bar owner. When she comes in one night beaten and the next ends up hospitalized due to the abuse of her owner, McCall sets about trying to buy her freedom. The mobster laughs in his face, surrounded by his henchmen. As McCall heads for the door they continue laughing. But hes not leaving. Observing the men and the weapons on hand, McCall sets his watch for the amount of time he thinks it will take to change things and begins his attack. Within minutes he is the only one left standing.
You would think this would be the end of it, that he would leave unnoticed and Teri would be free. If that were the case the movie would be much shorter. Instead it turns out that the men McCall killed were members of an east coast Russian mob boss. Rather than find peace McCall is hunted down by the one man who may be his match, the main enforcer of this mobster named Teddy (Martin Csokas). Teddy is every bit as cold hearted as McCall is skilled. Both men know how to inflict damage. As Teddy begins to get closer and closer to McCall, McCall has other things to concern himself.
Other friends like Ralphie need help. It seems his mother is a victim of extortion by two corrupt cops. Without being asked McCall helps. Another co-worker is robbed while working at the store, her mothers ring stolen as well. It reappears the next day. And through all of this Teddy gets closer and closer to McCall until they eventually meets in a showdown that was inevitable.
The original series had a well-mannered, well dressed Edward Woodward in the role of McCall, his Australian accent and upper class appearance making the jobs he took on out of the goodness of his heart in an attempt to make up for all the bad he did in his life seem a bit unreal. But you always wished that there were someone like him out there. For me I think Id rather like this McCall to show up. I think I would much rather have the calm, cool, collected McCall seen here that has no problem taking out someone who does wrong. The times have changed since that TV series aired and a much more violent world is out there. This McCall has no problems that the old one would have dealt with when it comes to holding back.
Washington does what he always does, he turns in a performance that is both believable and well done in every way imaginable. With touches of humor, displaying a caring person at his core and a man who has no problem killing when the need arises, Washington has formed a hero that this world calls for. It might seem an easy thing to do but the combination of peaceful and violent personas combined in one person is not as easy a task as it sounds. Csokas is one of those actors that always seems type cast as the bad guy. The thing is when you do it so well its hard not to cast you in those kind of roles. Once again he does a magnificent job as the near equal to Washingtons McCall when it comes to skills needed for his job.
The movie delivers on all promises made in the trailer that arrived in theaters months before the film was released. You get a solid update on a well-known show (even if it ran back from 1985-89) that takes the source material and makes it fresh. The action you would expect from this sort of film is on full display. The production values are top of the line. And in the end you stop the disc wishing there were more. Word is a sequel is in the works. Heres hoping it gets made and soon. This is one worth adding to your collection.",1425168000,,4845,4.290393013100437

6527020,4,B00M0GM4DS,"The Equalizer pairs the team of actor Denzel Washington with Director Antoine Fuqua in their first project since 2001s Training Day.  The film is loosely (very loosely) based on the late 1980s TV series of the same name which starred the late Edward Woodward as former cover ops agent Robert McCall, who uses his skills to help those in need.

McCall is a seemingly average guy working at a home improvement warehouse where he has become a sort of life coach and mentor to a co-worker who aspires to become a security guard.  McCall leads a highly regimented lifestyleok lets call it like it is, the guy is a massive obsessive compulsive.  One of his nightly routines is a late night visit to a local diner where he lays out his silverware and reading material meticulously.  Another nightly visitor to the diner is a young Russian prostitute name Alina (Moretz).

When Alina fails to show up at the diner for a couple of nights, McCall discovers she is in the hospital after having been severely beaten by her pimp.  He goes to the restaurant run by the Russian mobsters who run the prostitution ring and offers their leader, Slavi, $9800 to buy Alinas freedom.  Slavi laughs in McCalls facebig mistake!  Thirty seconds later the room full of thugs is dead and we know McCall is no mere stock clerk.  In response, the Russian mob sends its top enforcer, Teddy (Csokas) to Boston to kill McCall.

Dirty Harry, John Rambo, John McClane, Rooster Cogburnadd Robert McCall to the all-time list of great screen bad asses.  This is not your usual action film where there is some back and forth between the hero and the bad guys.  Lets make this perfectly clearfrom beginning to end this is all about Denzel Washington wreaking Holy Hell of the Russian mob.  Oh sure there is a half-hearted attempt to make his character seem vulnerable when Teddy takes several of McCalls co-workers hostage to lead him into a trap but even that is no more than a speed bump along the way in McCalls path of destruction.

Some might claim this means The Equalizer simply doesnt have enough conflict and that the characters near invulnerability is unrealistic.  But sometimes its nice just to see the hero faceoff against a diner full of robbers, a high rise full of armed thieves, or a valley full of outlaws, and just unapologetically kick ass!  Other actors could pull of the role but few with the kind of steely calm and unyielding will that Denzel brings to the table.  It might not be his greatest performance but its damn good.  And I have yet to see Chloe Grace Moretz in anything that I haven't enjoyed.  If you want to throw darts you can aim at the one-dimensional villains or the minimal background were given about McCall.

This isn't the 80s TV series other than in name.  Those looking for the more cerebral Edward Woodward version are likely going to be put off by the level of violence in the film but it definitely was one of the better action films of 2014.

6527024,5,B00M0GM4DS,I have always had a great deal of respect for the talent of Denzel Washington. But this movie although a good movie wasn't a movie that would prove to be a challenge for him. He was flawless in this don't get me wrong I don't know anyone who could've done a better job. I'm just say I've seen what the man is capable of. But the movie was good. The bad guys were really bad and of course the good guys were really great. The victims were tragic.,1424995200,,445,4.068181818181818
6527025,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Well its Denzel Washington, apart from the fact that he already played more or less the same man in 'Man On Fire'. Yes, the Equalizer is a classic and has been around long before Man On Fire but Man On Fire came out before this adaptation and Denzel is starring in both and he is being given producer credits for this rendition of Equalizer. I think he should have given more care not to let it develop along the very similar lines right down to what I think were the 2 best punch lines of both movies - needing 'permission' to take revenge and the 'life for a life' proposals. Denzel, you are a great Actor and a maturing smart one too getting involved in the back office work of the movies you star in, but be careful not to type cast your own self leading to overexposure and reducing your stock.

All that said, it is an action movie and both hero and villain deliver their sides well, the moral and sentimental versus the psychopathic. They make their points with their minds, fists and guns. I go for this kind of stuff any day.

The supporting cast is good too on both sides (hero and villain), and their input is well balanced. The director shows maturity in feeling no need to over indulge their supporting roles.",1424995200,,1222,4.378854625550661

I like seeing the bad guy get there but kicked like thy did in this movie and I think it bring to light something else I now it was fiction but I am shure a lot of the girls in escort service like in the movie are probly part of a gang like in the movie I think it should make some guy think twice before partaking in services like that. Looking at it in the story line how many outher girls did he save from that life by taking them down. I highly recommend it there is a lot of swearing in it which doesn't bother me u can hear that just waking down the street now a days. I highly recommend it I also love it just from the entertainment point. If u like lot of vilence and tons of action this is a move for u.,1424822400,,870,3.8121546961325965

Not an Academy award winner but will hold your interest through out as things are a little ""vague"" in the beginning but come together nicely throughout the movie.",1424304000,,417,4.736111111111111

6528120,5,B00M0GM4DS,"In my opinion, the plot was unique and riveting, but the movie contained too many gruesome scenes.  However, the movie's savagery did enrich the movie's purpose and method.  The movie's purpose was to focus on a main male character who anonymously fought and protected the kinder, more vulnerable society members. This heroic purpose was in stark contrast to his chosen methods.  To defend the defenseless, he was forced to kill or maim the perpetrators.  Juxtaposing the main character's altruism to his brutal slayings added to the movie's point and heroic declaration.",1424304000,,571,5.241758241758242

There are plenty of movies with this sort of plot, but The Equalizer is one of the better ones.  It's a long one at over two hours but the pace once it kicks into motion means you don't even notice it.  Chloe Moretz does a brilliant job in the small amount of screen time she has who is the motivator for Denzel to return to ways he swore to leave behind.  She has a nice little documentary on an organisation set up to help real life young girls in the same situation as her character in the special features of the DVD version I watched.",1423872000,,742,4.24113475177305

This wasn't that movie; it was so much more. Although I'd never seen the original, I'm glad it was made. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to see Denzel do this, making his character so believable that I was rooting for the most sadistic ways to kill men without any morale.
The only trait I wasn't buying was his OCD; he manipulated it to fit his agenda, and that is a unique behavior that can rarely be altered.
Lets just say that I enjoyed this.

6528529,5,B00M0GM4DS,"For me, The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington was probably the best all around action movie of the year, just edging out John Wick with Keanu Reeves in it.  The reason it beat out John Wick was because this is also a thinking man's movie.

By that I mean Denzel Washington gives meaning to his character with just the simple expression of his eyes.  He doesn't have to say anything or do anything.  You can actually tell he's giving the situation some careful consideration before he moves into action such as when he first takes out Russian thugs in the office in back of the lounge.  He opens the door of the office to leave two or three times, trying to make an important decision.  It's certainly a tough one to make.  Should he kill the men in the room and then deal with the consequences, or just walk away and hope for the best?  When the camera focuses on his eyes, you can see him thinking long and hard.

This is acting at its very best.

There's a reason why Denzel Washington has won two Oscars during his career, and it's still a long ways from being over.

In The Equalizer, Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, who works in a Home Depot-type of store, selling lumber and supplies for construction, or just fixing things around the house.  At night he has trouble sleeping and visits the local diner where he has a cup of coffee and reads quietly to himself.  It's also the hangout for Teri or is it Elena, played exquisitely by Chloe Grace Moretz, a young prostitute who turns all of her money over to the Russian mafia.  She's inadvertently drawn to McCall because he treats her like a fellow human being and encourages her to better herself.

A limousine stops in front of them one night when Teri is kind of walking McCall home.  Her boss gets out of the car, along with an armed driver, and forces her into the backseat.  Even then you can see Denzel thinking, ""Should I or shouldn't I?""  Teri attempts to resist, but they over power her and drive off.  A few days later she ends up in the hospital, badly beaten.

That's when Denzel Washington visits the Russians at the back of the lounge, offering them everything he has to buy Teri's freedom.  When they refuse, he puts the money back into his pocket and prepares to leave.  As he starts to leave the room, he opens and closes the office door a few times, making his famous ""no turning back"" decision.  When he turns around and faces the men, he's calm and relaxed, knowing exactly what he has to do.  He even looks at his watch and judges the amount of time it will take to kill them all.  Though he's not as fast as in his younger days, McCall still manages to take out everyone in the office without breaking a sweat.  As he tells the head mobster afterwards, ""You should have taken the money.""

Of course, this is only the beginning.  The head honcho over in Russian sends his top fixer (Teddy as played by Marton Csokas) to solve the problem.  Even with him and a hand-picked crew of killers, they're no match for Denzel Washington, especially with the final sequence in a Home Depot.

As Denzel Washington's ex-CIA handler tells her husband.  ""McCall wasn't coming to me for information.  He was coming to get permission to kill them.""  That is when we learn that McCall's late wife died of cancer, and then he staged his own death so could leave the CIA without any problems.  He also has a very special relationship with his handler (Susan Plummer) that reminded of the kind a mother and son usually have.

The Equalizer did so well at the Box Office that the movie studio that made it, green-lighted the sequel.  That usually takes a year or longer, but not this time.  We should hopefully have another Equalizer film out in 2016.

The regular DVD doesn't have much in the way of extras on it.  It certainly has more than John Wick, but what little there is can be watched in ten minutes.  I've read that the Blu-ray has more in the way of special features to watch, so I guess I'm going to have to get that one, too.  Otherwise, a great action movie!",1423267200,,4039,4.440816326530612

Recently he did a movie with mark Wahlberg, two guns, I believe it was called. Very good for both and now we have the Equalizer, I was so skeptical, because I remembered the original series on TV and loved it. So why mess around with it? I went at it as something totally divorced from the TV show and I did really enjoy it, oh, it had its predictable moments but all in all....very good, lots of action and lots of death and destruction.

I like it, some great a$$-kicking moments, but like Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, just lacked a little something - a connection to the audience, the stuff you find out about the past comes to late to make it make sense, and the run up to the action takes so long, and then sprinklers don't really work like that - they are zoned, they sprinkle where the heat breaks the element in the sprinkler head.  The idea is to put out a fire, not ruin the entire building.  Doesn't it seem odd that the average thug with a gun cannot hit a stationary target and these guys that are after him are supposed to be real pros?  Really liked the connection of the main characters.  But why am I complaining?  I was entertained, (nearly instantly though Amazon Video) and I would watch a sequel.  When I watched the original, TVs didn't have remotes and we only had like 4 channels to choose from that came in with any clarity...",1422921600,,1012,4.351063829787234

I'm not gonna sit here and right five pages worth of review on this movie, so I'll make it short and sweet. I thought this movie was very stale, the concept of the movie was good but come on their should be some competition. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. The movie made it seem like he was unstoppable in no matter what he did, but at the same time that could be bad and good at the same time. Bad because their is no one that can stop his just awesome fighting power and what not. Good because it's not like most action movies where the star fights bad guys then something happens then fights back and gets whatever he started looking for. But I still own this movie just for the fact that Denzel is pretty awesome in any movie he does. Would I say this is his best? No not really. Is it his worst? No, but could be a better movie.

I would like to suspend belief and just enjoy the flick, but something is wrong here. Why do we enjoy extreme revenge? Are we secretly this angry at the world? Is it O.K.that we are still taking out revenge for 9/11?
  All movies are teaching us things. It's not just an action movie, it supports an aggressive policy.
  Perhaps we see a corrupt world without justice, and yearn for someone strong to protect us. But, do we really want them to kill everyone who hurt us , or might hurt us? Would the hooker he saved approve of his actions on her behalf? It's all done in secret, without her knowing. This omnipotent vengeful character is so efficient at bringing death, and never kills the wrong people. He does not bring justice, just more violence and  more death....Oh boy, can't wait for the sequel!

There's plenty of action and violence spread out as the story builds to its finale, well paced with good acting all the way, Chloe Moretz also stars but only has a small role throughout, but what a beautiful and talented rising star she is too, if you love a good easy to watch exciting revenge thriller then you know Denzel is always good for the money! highly recommended watch!",1422403200,,1194,4.382882882882883

Let me summarize the basic plot line - Denzel = American = Good guy, helps his neighbour be a better person, individualistic, ex-CIA vigilante who gives bad people their come upance (with extreme force) and maintains freedom & justice where the Government and Police don't. He also saves a prostitute from the mob by being nice to her (and killing those who hurt her). Did I meantion he single handedly took down an entire Russian Mob by himself? The guy is unstoppable. Bullets never hit him, no amount of muscle can stop him. An elite team of specialized killers with M16's and Sniper rifles are no match for his barbwire and garden supplies. Denzel = New Rambo.  Russian Mob = Bad, Collective foreigners, into all things corrupt, oppose freedom, misogynists, and have corrupted the police force. Police = Bad and Corrupt. Violence = the answer for everything. There were more F-Bombs in this movie than I've heard for a long time and they were all in bad taste. The movie was unnecessarily gratuitous - especially the scene where the main Russian Bad guy strangles the prostitute. The whole story seemed like a bad reboot of Rambo.

The Equalizer storyline was as lame as John Wicks , but John Wick had some great  action  choreography while the Equalizer just depends on Denzel Washington's acting with has Him being Mr Nice Guy at a Home Depot type workplace , but really is a burnt out spy agent. Unlike John Wick who coolly out shoots and out fights with His pistol , McCall relies on wit and using practical household appliances to kill His enemies or anything around Him . Denzel is either cool or convincing  . The role should had went to Elba and they should had kept Him British , but I guess Washington had more star power and it did good at the box office at a time when there isn't any good films out .

6528955,2,B00M0GM4DS,"strengths:
(1) acting;
(2) a hero you can care about, who does positive work in his community;
(3) decent dialogue (though thought cussing by crooked officers excessive and dumb. I guess their swearing was supposed to emphasize that they were bad guys too, but it only made them seem dumb. a dumb villain is not scary.)
(4) like how Hollywood is presenting prostitutes as sex slaves, finally.
weaknesses:
(1) story, specifically, the villains. they are either dumb or behave nonsensically/unbelievably. ex: a man uninvited enters their lair. he behaves oddly and yet they don't have a gun up and aimed at him until he's already attacking them. these are 5 violent mobsters yet they act as if they cannot be attacked;
(2) fight scene blocking. one lone man takes out 5 mobsters as they attack him pretty much one at a time. why don't they all attack simultaneously? at the store when the hero's friends/co-workers are held hostage. hero manages to isolate and kill villains who behave as if they have no experience in villainy and separate and go off on their own, yet they know the hero is in the store as he's manipulating the lights;
(3) the hero is sympathetic but unbelievable that he takes on all these guys and succeeds. I have a similar difficulty believing when Liam Nielson does the same type of thing in Taken or one of the Taken sequels;
(4) music is heavy handed;
(5) didn't like the slow motion;
(6) in this time of read-of heightened security monitoring by authorities (phones, computers, cameras, etc.), kinda hard to believe in this old timey kind of Russian villain who seems to have no difficulty running his operation in America from Russia. Think it would've been more believable had the top bad guy been American. The Russian villains in the story seem to belong more in 1980s or 1990s American films. I think this genre needs to be brought up to date. With all the alleged monitoring being done by who knows which agencies, kind of difficult to figure how a major drug kingpin can operate without getting busted. Be nice to see in a fictionalized film how drug king pins can still move their product, own and move slaves and run guns if it is true as alleged that some governments can monitor every phone call in the world (I've read that somewhere, don't know if it's true, but do believe security is big worldwide now and would be interesting if a film showed how security and illegal drugs move in the world and how major drug operators avoid prison.)
Rate it 2 and a half stars. Kinda worth a watch if you like Mr. Washington or if you like the lone wolf, pro-justice enforcer type story, but could've been alot stronger if the villains had been more believably written.",1422230400,2,2696,4.665966386554622

Denzel Washington's Equalizer hero is battling ruthless Russian gangsters to get revenge for the beating they gave a friendly prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz).  There is plenty of extremely vicious action in this film for the action fans.  While the Russians are really bad and covered with more tattoos than the Japanese Yakuza, this McCall is almost as bad.  Perhaps if they had not had him relish as he stares in their eyes and enjoy watching them die I could have rooted more for him.  As someone who has seen more than his share of war I can honestly say someone who does that is a serious psychopath.  The writers should have given him more compassion and made the character a little more cerebral than just a soulless killer.  Ah, just me.  It was a action packed film that action fans might enjoy.

I liked the fact that they kept the cliche's to a minimum and didn't try to turn the character Robert McCall into a caricature of his 80s counterpart. I watched the series from start to finish as a teenager, and I can honestly say that I was rather shocked when I watched this. This is one of the few attempts at modernizing an old series that captures all the important parts of it's origin.

He's a former spy, but he's not wallowing in self pity. You can tell he's affected by his old life but he isn't weepy or self centered about it. He's the kind of hero that I want to see on screen --devoid of stupid catch phrases and trumped up, insane ways of killing bad guys. He's a man to be feared in all respects and the villains were not stupid --they just weren't in his league. I WILL watch this again.",1422230400,,840,4.217391304347826

6529011,3,B00M0GM4DS,"If you ever watch Steven Siegel and van damme flicks, you'll probably like this.  Its an ok film but the plot is too predicable. Its started off good but then gradually went south . What amazed me about the film was how Denzel with no gun was able to take on a bunch of Russian gangsters and kill them  one by one;  .  Of course as always, Denzel's acting was superb .

This film would of been better if the following occurred:  first:  when Denzel encounters the Russian trafficking leader for the first time , there were 5 Russian gangsters in the room; all about too kill Denzel if he was about to attack the leader.  I think if they had maybe 2 or 3 in the room instead of 5, then Denzel would of had a more realistic chance of beating those guys; this to me would of made more sense.......

second: Denzel had like ESP though-out the whole movie. He knew every move by any person that was associated with the gang. Everything was too obvious.

Third: Denzel was like Bruce lee. A hard working man working at home depot to a martial arts expert who should work for a top navy seal team. I felt that He didn't have to be a martial arts expert but rather a witty opponent who  knew how to out smart the opponent.  fourth:  the ending was very dry...typical cat and mouse game where Denzel hides in the home depot shop and he is able too kill the bad guys one by one.  What's even more amazing is that no one of the hostages got killed..  If this happened in real life, most likely 2 or 3 would of have been killed.

Note:  I love watching movies and I compare foreign films vs U.S.A films and my opinion is that foreign films provides a more simple and realistic approach on how we live day by day where as US films are more fantasy driven and animated with the same old plot or remakes over and over again.  I've seen some great U.S A films such as dances with wolves, fargo, frantic, titanic, etc; however, In my opinion as far as the quality movies that are out there, I would lean toward the foreign films.",1422144000,,2012,4.222513089005235

Like anything though, I'm not looking for exact copies. As this movie stands, it's a great flick. Denzel makes this character bad ass, he makes him believable and best of all, you want to root for him each step of the way. He's a guy with a skill set and he's just trying to make the world better around him. This is the Denzel I loved from Training Day. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good watch on movie night. I hope they continue the story of this character with a sequel.",1422144000,,621,4.098360655737705

6529017,5,B00M0GM4DS,This has to be one of Denzel's top three movies in my book. It's right up there with Training Day and The Book of Eli. This is a well thought out action movie that keeps you in suspense from beginning to end. You just want to see the guys get what's coming to them. The suspense keeps your adrenaline going.

Denzel's character is a perfect mix of interesting and mysterious. There was never a dull moment. The plot centers around a Russian gang that Denzel's character crosses pathes with while trying to help a young girl stuck in a troubled life. What ensues is a fun adrenaline rush packed with great action/fight scenes. Anyone who is a fan of Denzel Washington and loves action will enjoy this film.

6529065,5,B00M0GM4DS,"THE EQUALIZER the storyline is heavily based on the 1980's TV series of the same name
Denzel washington plays Robert McCall a retired black ops government operative who becomes a best friend of
teenage girl Teri played by Chloe Grace moretz whose life has been Destroyed as a sex slave by the Russian mafia
one time Teri gets beaten very bad and ends up in Hospital to recover
so Robert feels obligated to go after the Russian mafia & Destroy the russian mafia,
and then in the last scene of the movie before credits roll
Teri gets Discharged from Hospital and starts a new life for herself thanking Robert for what he's done for her
Robert is very happy for her he then puts an Advertisement on his website
ODDS AGAINST YOU, DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN TO, EMAIL THE EQUALIZER
and then the credits come up,
so the film is heavily based on the 80's tv series for sure
there is a sequel in the works

brilliantly written screenplay by Richard wenk who obviously was influenced alot by the 80's tv series of the same name
when he wrote the screenplay and brilliantly Directed by Antoine Fuqua
Denzel washington plays a brilliant Robert McCall for Modern society
Great performance aswell by Actress Chloe Grace moretz who plays the teenage sex slave Teri
Great acting perfomance by Actor Marton Csokas who plays russian Enforcer Teddy who seeks revenge against McCall
The film is extremely violent i must say especially when Robert McCall takes action against the Russian mob
the fighting/killing scenes are very brutal No holds barred at all
Denzel washington plays McCall very very smooth & confident, incredible acting by Denzel
Marton Csokas plays Teddy just as equally violent to
especially one scene where Teddy has one of the sex slave girls in a Head lock to get info out of her about McCall
she keeps dening that she knows nothing so teddy strangles her in head lock until she's Dead
No holds barred
Brilliant Directing by Antoine Fuqua
there is a sequel in the works, Richard wenk is writing the screenplay again,
Denzel washington will reprise his role again

the picture quality looks extremely sharp & clear no grain at all in 2:40:1 widescreen
plus there's no more 5.1 master mix anymore,
most Action films that have come out on blu-ray the last 12months
now have a boosted 7.1 Master audio mix now so the sound quality is amazing
there's new special features to
INSIDE THE EQUALIZER 8mins featurette about the making of the film
interviews with Antoine Fuqua, Denzel washington, Chloe Grace moretz, Marton Csokas,
Bill pullman and screenplay writer richard wenk
DENZEL WASHINGTON-DIFFERENT KIND OF HERO- 7mins featurette interview with Denzel washington
EQUALIZER VISION- 7min featurette, the cast & crew comment on Director Antoine Fuqua
ONE MAN ARMY-FIGHTING & TRAINING featurette
on the set behind the scenes look at the Fight Choreography with Denzel washington
and Photo Gallery
all these featurettes could be played continously as 40mins making of Documentary for sure
for some reason it wasn't, the interviews have been split into small featurettes on the menu, stupid idea.

this blu-ray release is the best to get, the picture quality is amazing better than DVD
the sound quality has been boosted to a new 7.1 master audio mix

6529067,4,B00M0GM4DS,"I enjoy Denzel Washington in most movies, and this was movie no exception. Going into this film, I knew of the Equalizer TV series but had never seen it, so I was approaching this from a fresh perspective. I therefore can't comment on whether or not they added little nods to the series.

I found Denzel's character fascinating, and I love the way he portrayed him. It was just the right mix of compassionate yet tough inscrutability. I found the juxtaposition of his loneliness and his reaching out to help total strangers very moving, and it's enjoyable seeing corrupt, cruel people brought to such satisfying justice.

On the flip side, while I expected this movie to have some violence, I found it gratuitously gory and graphic in places. I think they could have made the same point without being so bloody, almost to the point of B-movie shock death effects.

Still, I'd see it again...the performances and story were that strong.",1422057600,,935,4.795031055900621

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen him in, and one of the best action/suspense films I've seen in years.  There are a few things that are hokey like the Russian villain is almost comically villainous at times with his over exaggerated evil expressions and surly commands to ""find him.""  Aside from that, Denzel's performance carries the movie to suspend any disbelief in my opinion.  I kept having to stop the movie and take breathers at certain intervals, as it's really intense.

6529112,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Awesome!  Character is very befitting of Denzel. He played the role beautifully.  His character was not lacking in depth.  I personally love the 'Hit-Man' genre type of movies where the villains are being hunted rather than the other way around.  I noticed that his character never uses a gun except for one scene at the beginning. Found that to be interesting. The antagonist I found to be cliche' though.  They tried to make the character colorful but, I feel they failed and the interaction between Martin and Denzel was not as involved and was anti-climactic at best.  Nicholi, who, obviously was a dark/twisted individual did things towards the end (won't say what he did so as not to spoil the ending) that were not in-line with his MO. However, my issues with this aspect of the film are minor.  Overall, I found the film very enjoyable and worthy of a re-watch.  Soundtrack for this film was great too.

I enjoyed the acting in the film and the production value. It brought to mind how there are times in life that you see the weak being preyed upon and don't know if you have the strength, courage or ""know how"" to help. This is like a dream for the person that wishes they could go ""balls out"" in protecting the weak. It's a bit bloody for me but I was able to get past that due to how good the story was.

The last scene made me remember why the name seemed so familiar. It's based on the television show from the eighties! D'oh!

The characters were well acted, the story semi-plausable yet the pace of the movie was glacier like.  I blame this more on the director and post editing more than the actors.

6529160,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I was a great fan of THE EQUALIZER television series with brilliant Edward Woodward as the ingenious, reflective, skilled, rigorous altruistic with the highest sense of ethics. He also killed the bad guys with impunity. I did not know what to expect from this film with an African-American as the eponymous McCall  instead of Woodward's European-American. But the wonderful result is that Denzel Washington  fully inhabits the role and would have made the film worthwhile just for his performance alone. However, the plot. although it is not original, is very well paced, the secondary character are well portrayed and the villain is suitably amoral. The violent scenes are extremely violent but also very brief  except for the closing show-down. The film has an air of self-importance that I did not buy. It's violence  as entertainment. Whatever moral lesson the film makers think they are presenting is swamped by the charming characterizations and the ultra violence. But I found the extra length at 2 hours and 18 minutes was necessary because extended scenes which illustrate McCall's unforced and self-effacing altruism. And generous actor that he is Denzel Washington allowed his co-stars to shine in their scenes with him. I find him to be so appealing.

6529165,4,B00M0GM4DS,"After my bad reviews of the last two Denzel movies, I feel the need to give this a review as well.  Denzel has gotten back on track as an action hero with The Equalizer.  This is a good basic good guys vs bad guys story with lots of action and excitement.  His last two movies, Flight and Two Guns, contained meaningless and pointless nudity.  I suppose that was to try to prop up poor scripts.  But, this is a great story about an ex-CIA agent who swore off the violent life and was doing quite well until he was faced with pain and injustice.
  If you liked Man on Fire, you should like this.  It's just a little toned down from MOF, but what isn't.
  Denzel is great at playing the smoldering contemplative action hero, and he shines as such in this film.  Not for children, but I liked it very much.",1421884800,,803,4.217105263157895

6529211,5,B00M0GM4DS,A very good movie.  I suggest buy a copy.,1421712000,,41,3.5555555555555554
6529212,4,B00M0GM4DS,"THE FILM: Directed by Antoine Fuqua and based on a 1980's TV show (which I haven't seen), THE EQUALIZER stars Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a quiet man with a murky past who has a keen sense of justice and helps those in need. While this film could have been a pulpy, ultra-violent mess, the team of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington (who previously collaborated on TRAINING DAY) bring a sense of realism and attention to character that elevate this above your typical revenge action picture. As the title character, Denzel Washington brings gravitas and his usual ""coolness"" to the role of Robert McCall. He's a man of few words, and also one who is methodical and precise. He also has a good sense of right and wrong, which is why he does what he does, and not just in a violent way. He's a very friendly man who helps his friends and co-workers in other ways as well, i.e., training a fellow Home Mart employee for a security guard exam. One thing I really liked was the way in which you could tell what he was thinking by him just giving a look, and in fact, we are introduced to him in a largely wordless opening sequence. The film also stars Chloe Grace Moretz as Ilina/Teri, an underage Russian prostitute. While she did a great job portraying her character, she was little more than a plot device that springs McCall into action. I should also mention Marton Czokas as Teddy, a Russian heavy who is brought in to investigate after McCall kills several Russian pimps in retaliation for putting Ilina in the hospital (of course, after offering them a way out). He was the only other character besides McCall who really had any depth, and he brought a certain lethality and sadism to his character which contrasted nicely with McCall. Other than him, all of the villains were expendable and generic, which is unfortunate considering the quality filmmaking here. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo also appeared in glorified cameos as a friendly couple tied to McCall's mysterious past. They weren't anything special, but it was nice to see them in the film. Regarding McCall's past, though, they don't really go into much detail but it wasn't too much of a big deal because it contributed to his overall mystique and kept the focus on his everyman persona. As far as the action and technical side of the film, it was well-staged and shot, and it looked like Denzel did most of his own stunts. The fights were up close and intimate, but it was still possible to tell what was going on from shot to shot as well as having a good sense of geography. However, for the most part, the violence was restrained and brutally efficient instead of lingering on it in a gratuitous way, which was true to the character of McCall. Overall, despite not delving too deeply into any of the characters but McCall, THE EQUALIZER is a good examination of a down-to-earth hero who does what he feels is right in order to level the playing field for those who are unable to help themselves. There's also a nice sub-message about being who you want to be in life and not letting others dictate that for you. It's one of the best action movies in a while, and a great re-teaming of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington, who appears here in top form.

THE EXTRAS: There are a handful of featurettes which focus on various facets of the production, such as the character of Robert McCall as well as what Denzel Washington and Chloe Moretz did to prepare for their roles. There was also a couple of featurettes focusing on the director and the work that went into the action/fighting. To round things out, there was a short featurette on Chloe Moretz where she plugs for a sexual abuse hotline, Children of the Night, and an amusing 2-minute ""commercial"" for Home Mart that uses clips of the kills from the movie to demonstrate how good their customer service and products are. There was also a photo gallery with production stills and behind-the scenes pictures. Last, but not least, you can watch the film in ""Vengeance Mode"" which has Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua break down the moves used in the various action sequences. Altogether, a fairly handsome package for a great film.

OVERALL: This film was unfortunately one I missed when it was in theaters, but thankfully that has been rectified by seeing it at home. Denzel Washington created a compelling, badass character, and the film manages to be rather smart despite the subject material. Not only that, but there is a decent amount of supplementary material to deepen your appreciation and understanding. If you're a Denzel fan, or an action fan in general, I highly recommend buying this. You won't be disappointed.",1421712000,,4661,4.69682151589242

Robert McCall was a retired intelligence  agent who was brought into a battle with Russian gangsters when a young girl, a prostitute he frequently talked to at a diner was beaten and hospitalized by her handler. Roberts is OCD personified and disciplined to a fault. So when Robert offered the Russian guy $98K dollars to free the girl and they basically laughed in his face.. Needless to say, but I will any way.. Robert had the last laugh.. This movie was violent and crude, but also it was a very good movie..

6529374,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Awesome Denzel Washington action film, and very unique to say the least introducing the ""Home Depot"" element.  Who would have thought that ""Home Depot"" could be so deadly?

 First I must state that Denzel Washington is perhaps the absolute best actor in Hollywood, if not the last few decades.  Place him in ANY film, even if it is bad like ""Pelham 1-2-3"", and the film becomes good because the man really is that talented.

 I waited months on end for this film to come out because I am die hard fan of Mr. Washington and his work, and it seemed to me they delayed the film's release.  Never the less my friend from High School and I got together to see this and enjoyed what we saw but came out with a few issues; a nail gun? How many nail guns do you know can fire a projectile over fifty plus yards with such accuracy?

 The Russian mob boss, slash assassin villain is played up as a vicious psychopath where his exploits and crimes cause him to encounter the path of Denzel.  For all the work the writers, producers, and actors did in building the villainy of this character we are sort of left with a lackluster ending.  Denzel and all of his skills seem to build upon the fact that he is evenly matched up with this psycho, yet they never really duke it out in any dramatic action sequenced ""karate fight"" the way I felt they should confront each other with.  Instead we the audience are given the ""nail gun"" solution to their deadly rivalry.

 Finally being in my 30's I can clearly recall the original show from the 80's, way back, and I had been looking forward to seeing how modern producers could bring that plot into movies with Denzel's take on the character.

 The original show was about a high class, but tough no nonsense military slash secret agent Englishman who brought style and wit into his crusade to help regular people take on the criminals, and Terrorists that the police could not handle alone.  This Englishman had dressed very sharply, drove a nice car, and often used a gun if needed to bring down the villains who preyed on the innocent.  I was hoping that Denzel, whose intellect and veteran skills as an actor could match (if not execute even better) that same role with ease if Hollywood allowed him to, portray an American version of this character from the show.

 But instead these producers rather see Denzel play the role of a quite loner with a mysterious past that rather would use unusual methods of assassination to take down the bad guys, verse use a gun alone.  So what we are left with is almost a complete abandonment of the original premise, and a totally new genre only barely resembling the original work.

  I would have liked to see Denzel not only use his martial arts skills, expertise on assassination, and brain power, but also go back to the original material by using fire arms, driving a cool car, and out classing everyone in the room with charm that we all know he portrays best in all of his roles.

Praying for sequel where they stick much more to the original material of the ""Equalizer"" franchise, and allow Mr. Washington the flexibility and range to combine the drama of his characters with the dynamic ""action adventure bravado"" that the man portrays so well.

If I were to produce a ""Batman"" of ""X-Man"" film I would have the subject hero (or heroes) dress up and behave like the characters those franchises are known for, not place him in a clown suit juggling balls or bowling pins and say to everyone this is ""Batman"" or ""Wolverine"".  Hopefully with the sequel, if there is one, they will do the same the next time with him actually resembling ""the Equalizer"".

6529377,4,B00M0GM4DS,"I really enjoyed this movie for three reasons: The first is that the hero, unlike many Hollywood action hero guys, never loses his temper or acts like an idiot. In too many movies the good guy ""wins"" by getting mad, which is stupid. Second, I like the way the hero is actually a truly decent guy, without being Dudley Do-right (not that that is always a bad thing). He sees the good in people, and he tries to encourage it.

The third is that the violence in this movie is just about right. It's not over the top gory or unrealistic kung-fu madness. The fight scenes remind me a little bit of the Bourne movies, which is high praise indeed. If you like watching a quiet and understated hero dismantling a bunch of villains in a businesslike manner, this is your movie!",1421366400,,768,4.408450704225352

6529393,3,B00M0GM4DS,"Not every film can, or should be, great art. Sometimes great craft will suffice. ""The Equalizer"" shoots for the good craft award but succeeds only moderately.

Here's the scoop. Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, an O.C.D. riddled employee at a home improvement warehouse. He's well liked where he works and helps his fellow employees with various personal endeavors. But he can't sleep at night and heads to the local greasy spoon for some hot tea and a quiet read. He sees a young, female, aspiring singer whom he gets to know just a bit. When he sees she's in some dire straits with some nefarious folk we find that Denzel isn't exactly what we thought he was.

We've seen this before. Most recently with the much better ""John Wick."" But in ""John Wick"" it didn't take itself too seriously so it toyed with the audience. ""The Equalizer"" does and that is part of its downfall. The bad guys here are an ugly lot. Even the chief bad dude, played by Marton Csokas, seems to be the left hand of Satan himself. Even the cops are bad so this is an exercise in ugly. Then, when they spring the big surprise on the audience, it just feels cheap. It's been done too many times. So, now, how is Denzel going to do in the baddies in the big climax? Well, since it's set in the warehouse store, there are all kinds of clever ways the writer could think up to put in Denzel's hand. Yup. How many clever kills can he dish up? And the post script was about as painful to watch as possible. What a rookie way to write an ending.

I generally like director Antoine Fuqua's work. Though he does his usual adroit handling of the material, he's laboring under a bad script. To me, this was a similar problem in his previous ""Olympus Has Fallen."" It makes me wonder if he, himself doesn't see the faults in the script or is he hog-tied by his producers. Either way, it makes for not a great movie going experience.

This is a guy flick that will appeal to those needing a more visceral experience. But this will not go down in the annals of great action/revenge films.",1421366400,,2052,4.420634920634921

Like many responsible people, I watch revenge films because it satisfies, somewhat, that primal urge lurking beneath my conscience - the urge of the violent, unrestrained, savage, masculine hunger.  Denzel plays that part perfectly!!!

Denzel Washington is superb - fastidious, calm, controlled, unemotional, remote, and unspeakably vicious.  He plays Robert McCall on a level of such psychopathic brilliance, that it left me chilled, and oh, so satisfied.",1421366400,,540,5.392857142857143

I typically only kinda like neo-noir films. I watch so many movies that most neo-noir films, by nature, come across too formulaic and predictable. But, on the rare occasion that everyone involved ""gets it,"" you have masterpieces like this.

1. The Feel
The director, Antoine Fuqua--director of Training Day and Shooter!--certainly ""gets it."" You ""feel"" every scene. Not a second is wasted. There is that darkness and intensity that sucks you in - it is flawlessly maintained, and doesn't let go.

2. Denzel
Denzel always ""gets it."" When does this incredibly gifted actor not give us what we want? Every time I see him, it's as if he wrote the script - he's so in touch with exactly what the writer envisioned, and he manifests it to a tee. In this case, his character is a principled and extremely ""talented"" individual that doesn't have to overact to convey his talents - which is always, a million times over, more powerful. It is comical when people try his character, and you can tell he knows it.

3. Degree of Satisfaction in the Retribution
When Denzel ""Equalizes,"" it gets a 10 on the satisfaction scale. Like with Tarantino, there is NO MERCY. Many times writers and directors make the grave mistake of watering down the retribution with quick and easy killings - no creativity or satisfaction. Not here. In this film, the satisfaction is goose-bump inspiring.

4. Fight Choreography
I HATE when filmmakers take shortcuts here, and just make you dizzy because they're too lazy to show you creative maneuvering in the action scenes. Some incredible examples of luminous choreography in this area are The Matrix, The Bourne Identity, and, of course, THE RAID. In contrast, Taken 3 took the easy way out - you couldn't tell what was going on or who was doing what to who; there was a flurry of punches, etc., then someone was dead. Not here. In The Equalizer, every movement is meticulously crafted, creative, clearly shot, and sharply felt.

5. Scale
No spoilers from me. Suffice it to say, the movie does not stay in the small and insular world that it originates in...

This movie was just plain awesome.

""When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.""",1421366400,,2177,4.758620689655173
6529419,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I was a big fan of the old television series ""The Equalizer"" so I was very curious to see how Hollywood would handle what I always thought was a pretty interesting show with the late Edward Woodward starring in the title role.
I'm happy to say that Denzel Washington does the role of former CIA-operative-turned-vigilante Robert McCall proud in this newest incarnation of the show that was originally broadcast on CBS in the late Eighties.
On television, Woodward was a sophisticated private detective who drove a Jaguar and had access to some fairly advanced weaponry as well as a few colleagues who helped him track down and dispense with some very bad guys.
In the movie version, Washington's McCall is very much a loner and this, I think, makes him considerably more menacing than Woodward ever was. Another dissimilarity: Unlike Woodward's talent for acquiring advanced weapons when needed, Washington's version of McCall is as likely to use nothing more sophisticated than a sledge hammer or a power drill as he is a pistol.
Director Antoine Fuqua moderates the pace of this film nicely, never rushing through scenes and, thus, gives his actors a chance to add layers to their portrayals. Of special note are the scenes in a 24-hour diner in which Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays a young prostitute, interact. They have a nice chemistry and Moretz handles what is, for her, an unfamiliar role very nicely. In addition, there is a restaurant scene in which Washington and Marton Csokas - playing a conscienceless Russian mobster - square off in a low-key test of wills that gives both actors an opportunity to display just how menacing each can be with something as simple as a look.

I just didn't sense the overwhelming compassion he had for this young lady that made him want to go back to his old ways and create problems for himself. That missing part made the whole movie blah and pretty much not make sense. It was really unorganized. Some parts made me think ""why was that even necessary. I'm lost"".

Denzel did capture the character but the script was just bad. He did a good job with what he was given. Just one of those movies with cool fighting scenes and no substance.",1421020800,,649,4.408333333333333

6529627,4,B00M0GM4DS,I enjoyed this movie but I thought it was way too long - I really did not think all of the diner scenes were needed for the audience to get the point.

6529640,5,B00M0GM4DS,Denzel's age actually makes this role more believable given the original starred an older gentleman. This is another great feel good movie that has you rooting for the good guys.

The story has been written over and over, this is just another regurgitation of a one man army who apparently would rather use improvised weapons while seemingly never needing to pick up one of the many firearms dropped by the bad guys.

The story was great and there will be more in this franchise as the extras on the DVD talked about they are building a franchise around Denzel and The Equalizer character. I can't wait for the next movie. The story was great and really pulled you in during the whole movie.

This is a Sony movie and they employ that lame Cinavia encryption so you won't be able to make a back up blu ray except to play on players older then Jan. 2012. Normally I boycott purchasing Sony movies for this reason but this movie is so good I'll make an exception.",1420848000,,671,4.2015503875969
6529720,5,B00M0GM4DS,"I'd like to think the late, great Edward Woodward ( the original Equalizer and Breaker Morant star), would approve of Denzel Washington's Equalizer! Denzel is the Equalizer for the modern age. He appears as a very likeable character, a dedicated Home Supply employee, and he leads a simple lifestyle that hides his complexities well. But when he becomes aroused with the need for justice, he reacts with violence of action that totally betrays his usual self. The result is the bad guys get their deserved rewards, Denzel style! Oh, and never mind the usual display of military weaponry, the Equalizer finds favor (near the end) in using various power tools to get the job done! All in all, this is a great action movie that is left open for follow-ups. I loved it!",1420848000,,765,4.7593984962406015

I didn't know how to feel about this remake, but a reviewer compared it to Man On Fire, which I really enjoyed. So I decided to give it a chance. No, this is not the tv show. Consider it a prequel, before he became The Equalizer. Some reviews have said they didn't understand his motives, I guess they were unfamiliar with the show. The movie did have some slow spots, but when it moves ... WOW. A decent remake, definitely did the show justice and makes me want to see it again. Good acting. Great set of bad guys.

Everyone has their ups and downs, but this movie to me was one of his downs. It didn't show what he did to some of the people so it made you guess, did he kill the or just knocked  them out only 2 good fighting scenes were in the movie and why did it start out so random? Make a story line first. My dad loved the movie I just didn't get into it like some of his other movies like out of time or man of fire.",1420761600,,559,3.73728813559322

That said, if you don't enjoy these kinds of movies, I doubt this one will change your mind. It suffers from somewhat contrived writing, cliches at every turn, and some pacing issues.

In this movie he is the good guy and I enjoyed seeing him in that role again as lately he has been the marginal or bad guy. There is a lot of rough language in the film. The F word is used a lot along with M-F which we wished wasn't the case. The only thing I can say is that the language probably does fit the characters using those words rather than being some gratuitous language to titillate teenyboppers. I was going to give it 5 stars and a rave review but after a while I realized that the story is a bit formulaic with the outcome easily foreseen.",1420761600,,731,4.154929577464789

6529808,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington provides the perfect update for the 1980s TV show, The Equalizer. In this film hes a disenfranchised agent of  a secret agency.  The TV show had actor Robert Woodward in the role. This version relies heavily on  advances in computer technology and cell phones.  Its a natural progression for the character whose main objective is to gather reliable intelligence before attacking an aggressor.  Its intelligently written and acted. Hopefully it becomes a franchise.  Its one of those movies where the supporting characters are not just fodder to be eliminated by the villain.  All the actors in story have something to contribute to the tapestry.

The plot was basic.  Denzel, (Robert McCall) meets a young prostitute in a coffee shop who wants to leave that destructive way of life.  Well, it turns out her pimp is part of the Russian mob. They won't let her leave alive. The rest all falls into place as McCall goes about eliminate them one by one.  Its not the most realistic film.

6529846,5,B00M0GM4DS,"This is to date...my favorite action film!!! And I watch a lot of action flicks. At first thought of Denzel as lead I thought....meh.....but then we watched the trailer and were impressed.

Then we watched the film and WOW. The action sequences are brilliantly orchestrated with creativity, music, and badassness!! But what really makes this film the best, is Denzel. They choose not to use the familiar cliches of big muscles, big guns, final fight scene that lasts ten minutes between to leads arch enemies, and I appreciate that VERY much. To boot, they portray Denzel as a regular, normal guy. I mean, the first scene is him clipping his grey hair.

Without giving away the film, I will just say, that his acting is PERFECT for the role and makes the movie. His ice cold stare shakes the very core of the scariest, most evil, russian gangsters. His precision and timing (obviously some due to the artful editing) and calm demeanor bring an entirely new level to badass killer. He doesn't even look like he's trying hard. I LOVE his efficiency.

Anyways, it's a great movie, worth the rental fee.",1420675200,,1099,4.7434554973821985

We get to understand the type of person the main character in the first half of the movie; we learn his characteristics and habits and his mindset that will eventually lead him to his course of action during the second half of the movie.

The movie has a good pace throughout.  The end could have been done a little differently, but I think it was rushed due to the length of the movie. I can't wait for a sequel to come out.",1420675200,,533,4.257425742574258

6529906,3,B00M0GM4DS,"It's not that the acting was bad, this movie was just a bit too slow for my taste. It could have just as easily been made for TV. The action in this film was lacking and when you did see it, it was done quick fast and in a hurry, nothing to really savor. The plot was almost juvenile. Here you have a middle aged man that's plotting along in life in a depressing manor and along comes the young hooker, property of the Russian or Ukraine mob who knows, who gives him purpose in life. I tell you this kind of story has been done to death, HW please let it die!! This is easily for me the least favorite movie of 2014. I expect better and more from Denzel.

Unfortunately this movie includes pieces of a lot of his good films and kind of weaves them into this one. There is even the rattling theme music from Man on Fire played near the end. Also one piece from American Gangster.

The entire plot and script is uneven. Characters introduced and then forgotten. No motive at all for Denzel's character. Basically a lot of violence and situations copied from other movies. Direct to video at it's worst.",1420675200,13,549,4.65979381443299

No human being that I know of is capable of such seamless, powerful execution of their villains in the real world.  This is what makes the movie less appealing to me.  I did, appreciate , however, the great editing, and smooth flowing action scenes.  For a person seeking escapism in a movie, this is the type of movie that will satisfy them.

6530099,4,B00M0GM4DS,I liked it but did not love it.  The movie moved along at a good pace but I felt it needed more back story.  Denzil plays a likeable guy out and is eager to help friends.  He comes across as very lonely turns out his wife died and he seemed to dedicate himself to her memory.  Turns out that he was a hardcore super agent killer in his previous life.  This is where I would like to have seen flashbacks or at the very least a flashback of his wife dying to explain why he is the way he is now.  Yes he goes against the Russian Mob and the movie takes a kind of Jack Reacher tone to it.  Like the fact that the movies ends with the idea of sequel but I would like a Prequel kind of like the Jack Ryan / Tom Clancy movie.,1420588800,,719,3.8175675675675675

It's one of the things Denzel does really well.  (Remember Man on Fire)?  Could he make other more ""meaningful"" movies absolutely!  ---Where are they- the scripts for these ""meaningful movies""?  Not so very many out there these days.  So he is making a living, and doing it with a lot of style!  I loved this movie, corny scenes and all.  He is just so dam good at anything he performs in.  And who does not want to see thugs get what they deserve and then some!!!  Unless you have a special soft side for criminals of this ilk. It quite often does not happen in court in real life because well, that's just how the system works.  So we get to see it in make believe on the big screen.  We forget ourselves for a brief moment in time, have a laugh or two, and there were some very dark humor parts in this movie which I did appreciate thank you.  So lets remember that this is Hollywood, and most of what appears on the screen is Hollywood tinted.  If you want real, then watch documentary films, if you can find any of those that are totally accurate that is.  I give this movie 5 stars because it was entertaining, had imagination,( loved the hardware weapons )  and I like to see the mean guys get crushed.  And no I'm not a GUY,  I'M A GIRL  OMG!!!

Washington has towering strength beneath.  Moretz gravitates towards him and while not asking for his help, you can't help
feeling that she wants and needs it.  Marton Csokas is the perfect bad guy.  He exudes evil.

This movie is grittier, the violence is up front and in your face, the story is timely (Russian mob, human trafficking, police corruption, etc.) and entertaining.

But then, Denzel has to make a living too; maybe no better scripts came along, recently. Oh wait, I think he's a co-producer. Well, perhaps this slam bang action with predictable plot and no character development is a comparatively easier way to make a living than making a film that has a well-written script with good dialog, complex characters, good production values ... oh and LIGHT so you can actually see what's going on. If you want to see a good Denzel film, see the comparatively old ""Deja Vu.""

I learned in this film that we all have the power to make a positive difference in our communities. I love reading and Denzel loves reading in this movie too. Secondly, in this movie Denzel - the chief character reminds us about the essence of time management.

6531298,4,B00M0GM4DS,"If you want action and intensity this is your movie.  After first seeing this I would have probably given it 5 stars because I was truly blown away by what Denzel was offering to the role.  There was something incredibly intense that kept me hanging on to my seat.  I think the trick was the calm over Denzel's character the entire time he's planning his attack and carrying it out.  It's hard to imagine anyone who could do this better.  I would remove 1/2 a star (if it was possible) because I have seen movies like this a bazillion times over again going back to the original James Bond.  It's cool, we get it.  The first Taken movie was just a year before.  Then Taken 2, then the same year The Expendables, then Fast N' Furious, not to mention the knock off copycats right behind them... all in the same year.  It's really not the movies fault, but I can't in good faith give a 5 star review to something Hollywood seems so capable of doing well, and at this point, should be doing more ""interestingly"".  At this point, the Hollywood machine shouldn't have to steal it's ideas from average TV shows made 30 years before, even if they can book an actor who can/will total blow it out of the water.  In reality, it lacked real depth because it was just a TV show where characters aren't really developed, but again, Denzel does make due. I loved it for what it is but also hated myself for giving in to the popcorn fantasy powered by an actor talented enough to carry the movie.",1420502400,,1481,4.368613138686132
6531353,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor and the need for one in this movie is obvious up front.  If it had not been someone as well known or charismatic in the role the movie would have flopped in the first 30 minutes.  It is not an action flick in that there are long sections of philosophical self reflection among all the characters.  The concept is good and does give a background for the successful Equalizer series that preceded it to the screen.  Four stars for Denzel Washingtons acting, the story and slow plot line would only have gotten 2.5.",1420502400,,554,4.565656565656566

We never even learn what type of training he had in the past to become so efficient at killing; maybe I feel asleep during that part? ""Hensethetitleline"" The music at the end of the movie was ripped off from a much better movie - ""Heat"".  The music was used in the scene where Pacino is chasing down De Niro in his squad car, pulls him over and asks to get a cup of coffee. How unique is that? The movie is nevertheless ""entertaining"".

6531409,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Unlike the tepid 80's TV series of the same name Denzel brings it as a modern day Robert McCall, ex-CIA operator with lethal skills and an old school sense of justice.  This movie starts out slow for the first 20 minutes setting up the character but when Denzel enters the lair of some Russian mob bad guys after they beat up a young prostitute he's befriended, hold on to your hats.  The action never really lets up from there and this is entertainment on a par with the original Taken or the Dirty Harry films of the 70's.  McCall works in a big box hardware store (think Home Depot) and has been retired from his past black ops life and is trying to live quietly until he's pushed over the edge and then he's as deadly as Jack Bauer from 24.  It's typical in this genre to enhance the drama at one of more point to place the hero in jeopardy, that never happens in The Equalizer- McCall relentlessly pursues justice and takes on the Russian mafia enforcer and his henchman in a showdown at the ""Home Mart"" store that's very satisfying.

Action scenes were extremely well choreographed, reminiscent of the improvements in choreography observed in the second and third installments of The Bourne Trilogy. The editing was great too.

Liam Neeson's groundbreaking job in Taken I think is the reason for this upswing of veteran actors doing these types of movies. Anyway, the story works here for the vigilante genre but the opening act could have moved quicker, it's pretty slow going showing the repetitive life of Denzel. Once it got rolling it was very watchable. I do like action movies to be shorter than this one was. Denzel was pretty invincible, I was waiting for him to lift a car and throw it over his head or something. But, it's good Friday night entertainment.",1420502400,,611,4.5636363636363635

The movie is great, thanks to Denzel and the great choreography. I don't know how many times I had replayed the ""mega store"" fight scene which was underscored with the ""Vengeance by Zack Hemsey"". In short, a must buy, especially with the special features about Denzel and Chlo Grace Moretz! p.s. I look forward to its sequel very soon!",1420502400,,513,4.526881720430108

6531626,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel at the top of his game.  Pure adrenalin.  Nonstop action with sufficient character development to make you care about the players.  Denzel is absolutely great in this role.  Cool and confident and scary as hell when he unemotionally dispatches bad guys.  And who better to play the bad guys, the Russian mob, which we (America) are all fed up with and have been for years.  This could be an outstanding sequel or two.  Harkens back to the tv show in the 80's only no mercy is shown.  Appropriately violent toward the savage gangsters.  Maybe not a date movie; but, I would like the woman who likes this film.  It is quite badass.  As bad as his role in Training Day (although the bad guy) and as bad as his role in Man on Fire, two of his later action-packed movies where he brought out the dark side but maintained his humanity.  Well, not so much in Training Day, but he was outstanding in it.  This is a guy's movie and a top-notch one, at that.

I have noticed that the critics either love it or hate it and I agree that is how it will be with most people. So here goes my opinion. I think in places The Equilizer seems a bit slow- like at the beginning , but when it takes off it is like a rocket. Make no mistakes this is a violent revenge film. For those who care there is no nudity. To say too much about the plot would give too many spoilers. So I'll just put it this way...If the movie ""TAKEN"" and the comic ""The Punisher"" had a child it would be The Equilizer.",1420416000,,666,3.9776119402985075

Depot type store. When his young friend is hospitalized  by members of the Russian mob, McCall (Denzel) shows us why he is called the Equalizer!

6532349,4,B00M0GM4DS,"For me, this is one of Washington's better movies.  I like the sophistication of his character and the smooth way he acts during the whole movie.  He I tough, smart, skillful and a master of dealing death.  Everyone with the ability to portray this type of character has mastered the steely-eyed 1,000 yard stare.  Stallone, Saldana, Strahan and a few others of the good ones have it but Washington does it as good as or better than the rest.",1420416000,,442,4.556962025316456

6532844,5,B00M0GM4DS,"There are scary movies, there are movies that deeply move you, there are funny movies, there are artsy movies...etc.. Some film critics (professional and layman alike) seem to throw all different types and genres into a pot, stir, and then compare them all with each other on the same level.
""The Equalizer"" has gotten some pretty harsh reviews, and I really don't know why.
This is an action movie, and it is supposed to entertain action fans (and D. W. fans). If you can't stand action movies...watch something else.
Well, I am an action movie fan, and I think this movie is great. Denzel Washington is such an amazing actor; he owns every single role. He again delivers flawless acting in this movie, and there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. I found myself thoroughly and sufficiently entertained, which was just what I had expected and hoped for.
Woody Allen movies, such as ""Carnage"" (which I loved!) have their time and place, too. Just don't compare different genres...it simply does not make sense...",1420416000,,1020,4.8342857142857145

6532865,5,B00M0GM4DS,"The film opens with a quote from Mark Twain: The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.

Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a retired black ops CIA operative, who has peacefully disappeared and retired by becoming an affable and nearly unnoticed employee in a hardware store, where he befriends many of his co-workers and helps out others as opportunities arise.  McCall promised his deceased wife that he'd leave his old ""black ops"" life behind, but is compelled to act after a coffee-shop friend / hooker is mistreated by her pimp. To be faithful to his wifes wishes he always tries to resolve things peacefully, but ultimately more persuasive approaches are required to help out his friends. The plot takes on fascinating aspects from this point on.  In the end McCall is inspired to continue using his skills to help people in need and posts an online ad, identifying himself as ""The Equalizer"".

This is an excellent movie for those who enjoy action films with considerable violence and a good vs. evil plot.  Denzel Washington is outstanding as a low-toned self-effacing (seemingly) common-man, who is patiently persistent in his devotion to helping his friends where ever possible. Washington is also outstanding as a boiling-beneath-the-surface avenger, with the combined skills of Jason Bourne, James Bond, and Sherlock Holmes all rolled into one!

6532978,2,B00M0GM4DS,If you're looking for good action and a good story I would look elsewhere. All i can say without spoiling anything is that the movie felt like it dragged at times. I usually try not to take action flicks serious and enjoy it for what it is But I could not buy into the story and I couldn't ignore the obvious plot holes. The characters connection to each other was a joke to say the least. And the action was okay but could have been better.,1420329600,,441,4.1395348837209305

6533129,2,B00M0GM4DS,"Typical action movie that had a promising, subtle beginning. Then, in the last half of the movie, the bottom falls out and it becomes a paint by numbers cliche that hits every cliche that has been done in an action movie since the late sixties:

1) Baddies scream ""Who are You?!!"" to the hero as they get whacked. (done by Clint in High Plains Drifter and Keaton in Batman, and countless others)
2) Slow-Motion Hero moving through misting water and/or rain, against a bright back light. (done by Chow Yun Fat in The Killer and every other action movie including Flashdance)
3) Cool walking away from a massive explosion set by the hero who is too cool to look back at the explosion. (every action movie since we started filming in color)

I won't spoil the plot because I don't need to. You will figure out the hero's back story with the first action scene. Total waste of the tremendous talent of Denzel Washington. The difference between this movie and a straight-to-video action movie starring Steven Seagal? A higher budget and Denzel Washington. Save your money and watch the far-superior Denzel movie ""Man on Fire.""",1420329600,,1121,4.743589743589744

To be honest when I first saw the trailer I fully expected to be disappointed, thinking that they showed all the good parts. But they definitely did not do that, if you love fight scenes you will appreciate how well done this film was made. This film also has government ties, comedy, everyday jobs and corruption. In other words it has something that everyone can relate to. In this film you will find the ingenuity of MacGyver and the skills of Jason Bourne. One other  reason to enjoy this film is that no matter what happens in this movie, you will always know who the good guys are.

He takes it upon himself to exact revenge upon her pimp.  That revenge escalates to the very top man in Russia.

Man! This was a Good flick! I am glad I waited to see it for the first time at home on my PC cause it is long and I had to put it on ""Pause"" to be able to walk to the other room for a moment so I would not miss any of the movie.

6534580,1,B00M0GM4DS,"Very disappointing.  A lot of dark settings.  The lead character had only one tactic, brute force.  (this is NOT a comment on DW)  The Equalizer had peculiar way of sizing up his adversaries so he could analyze when and how they were going to make their next move.  And it was presented in slow motion to give the effect of him gathering data in a split second before the Equalizer strikes.  It was a boring effect for me, a little on the cheesy side, IMHO.

What's to say about Denzel Washington's acting?  He's a great actor.  I regret they made him a brute rather than a suave, subtle and charismatic character who puzzles events together and nails the culprit with the advantage of information and surprise.  Regrettably, I just didn't see any intrigue or plot twists, and Denzel doesn't get a chance to let his charisma shine.",1420156800,13,831,4.591836734693878

6534599,3,B00M0GM4DS,"I wasn't expecting much, but this film delivered both on the Jason Bourne-esque hand-to-hand action, but also invested time to develop Washington's character. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters are cyphers, with little or no effort expended to flesh them out beyond what's needed to provide the main character with people to save and bad guys to murder. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, but it's not a film I'd watch twice, nor am I interested in the sequel they're obviously setting up.",1420156800,,503,4.8604651162790695

6534655,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington returns to play the reluctant hero (Robert McCall) as only he can.  In the same vein as Man on Fire, and with a similarly righteous protagonist as he played in The Book of Eli, Denzel brings a character to the silver screen who is a real-life, modern-day dark night

There wasn't a dull performance in this film, and since the other reviews get in to great detail concerning plot summary, I won't bother with that here.

This is as much a drama as it is an action movie.  In fact, after only 5 minutes (and no expected action scenes), I found myself saying, This is going to be an unbelievable movie. I was already hooked.

6535032,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Olympus has Fallen, etc) has rethought and adopted the television series by the same name (Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim) with a script by Richard Wenk into a movie that is so well made that it shows every actor in the film at his/her best. Yes, it is violent, but the violence is directed at those evil men who benefit from the misery of others, never being arrested and never submitting to punishment.

Robert McCall (Denzel Washington in one of his finest roles) believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life in Boston, Massachusetts. He is methodical and supportive and works at the Home Mart store, frequently helping his co-workers. Every night, McCall goes to a diner to read a book and drink tea, and he befriends the teenager Russian prostitute Teri (Chlo Grace Moretz), the alias of Alina. One night, Alina's pimp Slavi (David Meunier) brutally beats her and she goes to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the local hospital. McCall goes to the Russian restaurant where Slavi is and offers US$ 9,800.00 for the freedom of Alina. However Slavi does not accept the offer and McCall kills him and his four bodyguards. The Russian mafia kingpin Vladimir Pushkin sends the cruel enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas - in an exceptionally fine performance) to find who killed his men. Soon he finds that McCall is the one who killed the mobster and Teddy begins a war against him. McCall may have a mysterious past but he has become a `Robin Hood' hit man who destroys those people who prey on others and in doing so he changes the lives of those for whom he is the benefactor.

The plot is appropriately complex, involving bad cops, the FBI, the Russian gangs and their multiple crime influences of human and drug and oil trafficking. The excellent cast includes Johnny Skourtis as Ralphie - the obese lad Robert McCall guides to a better life, Melissa Leo in a very brief but poignant role, Bill Pullman, David Harbour, Haley Bennett, etc. After a fine and tense drama the film is all but ruined by the wholly unnecessary noisy Rap music that destroys the mood during the credits. Despite this, this is a very fine film, overlooked for some reason. Grady Harp, January 15",1420156800,2,2273,4.737373737373737

The film need not have been so graphic in its violence, which diminished it. One totally improbable scene in which Washington takes on several adversaries at once could never, ever, have happened in real life. We all expect to stretch reality -- after all it's fantasy in the first place. This scene breaks the faith.",1420156800,,484,4.6395348837209305

6536070,1,B00M0GM4DS,"Although 'The Equalizer' is marketed as the reunion of Denzel with the director of 'Training Day', this movie is actually more like 'Man on Fire', the dull movie of ten years ago that has the same plot, i.e., Denzel kills the bad guys.  In 'Training Day' Denzel enjoyed being the bad guy but no one enjoys anything in this movie - it is all dull and dreary.

It is completely unbelievable that Denzel's character, a retired government agent, could eliminate dozens of bad guys.  Everyone knows government agents don't do field work, they sit behind desks and listen to our phone calls.",1420156800,4,585,4.715686274509804

U want a lil "" taken"" style action with bad directing, unbeliavable characters, horrible dialogue, cheesy plot?
Hey knock yourself out. The inconsistencies and explosion scene alone is worth a good laugh.
Apparently Denzel and Liam neeson have the same ambitions for there career.",1420070400,,385,5.209677419354839
6536118,3,B00M0GM4DS,"In some movies, such as Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, it is acceptable to be grossly unrealistic.  After all, it is Hollywood and only a movie right?  That seems to work well in certain genres such as a comedy slash action spy movies, but it does not work as well in a serious crime slash action movie like The Equalizer.  I don't know what the criminal justice system is doing in Boston, but I know that in Tacoma Washington if you commit those kinds of crimes, the police and the FBI would be taking over.  This movie is entertaining, but if you are a realist like me you might catch yourself saying ""there is no way that would happen"" or ""where the hell are cops at"" several times throughout the movie.  No one gets to be that bad ass, not even you Denzel Washington without a realist like me saying something about it.",1420070400,,841,4.3312101910828025

It makes you want to go to your local Home Depot or Lowe's & look at all the potential lethal tools.  See the movie then you'll understand.,1420070400,,391,4.243243243243243

I love Denzel, though.  The last thing I saw him in was Flight and it may be the stark contrast in film quality between that film and this one that makes Equalizer lack luster to me but I don't think so.

Denzel Washington plays a quiet man who works in a large home improvement center. He enjoys helping people, like one employee who is a security guy, and overweight. Denzel helps the guy get the weight off with no-holds-barred exercising. But he's also a mysterious man. Who is he really?
Often stopping in a diner for late night coffee, he has a friend in a young prostitute. He notices a bruise on her face, then she is brutalized by her pimp. I won't reveal any thing that might spoil the movie. Denzel Washington is, as usual, excellent in a role written especially for him. Very violent movie, but very good. I liked it a lot.

I am hoping for a sequel.  Okay there is a lot of killing, but these bad guys deserve it. And when they describe the top Russian ""bad guy"" as sociopath/psychopath Denzel helps you learn the meaning of the word.  Greatest line:  ""You know what I see when I look at you (says the Russian mobster looking at Denzel)  ""a fleck of dust"".

Very good acting, decent writing, very good production values. I mean, c'mon, you *know* Denzel's character was going to kick some serious butt! For the type of ""linear"", violent, action-film it was, it was very well made. Even my wife, who usually despises action flicks (e.g. ""Taken"", ""Bourne"" stuff) loved this movie.

6536433,2,B00M0GM4DS,"13 years after Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua revolutionized and fully revived the Action genre with 2001's wild charge of kinetic energy, ""Training Day"", the duo reunites with results as leaden as their prior collaboration was a wild and uncompromising roller coaster ride. Fuqua attempts to tell the tale of a man living a quiet and reserved life that is thrown into violence after the disappearance of a young woman (likably and well-played by Chloe Grace Martinez) he speaks to at a local restaraunt by slowly building intensity as the garden variety and underwritten and developed bad guys gradually descend on Washington. This style, a Fuqua trademark, is usually quite effective. The problem is the chain of events, ""surprises"", motives, characterizations are all so routine that the style just makes the snail's pace of the film all the more torturous and the flaws more visible. Not only does this make these primary storytelling angles fail but, even worse, it doesn't achieve the most basic necessity of this type of testosterone driven vehicle: it isn't even reasonably entertaining.

  What further sinks the movie is seeing Washington, who has proven he is capable of a wide range of dramatic and multi-layered roles, play essentially the same character, though a bit more reserved than usual (which is something), he has in the many Action roles he has dominated beforehand. This is frustrating but, his general charm still gives his protagonist more levity than the one-note screenplay gives him to work with. Such is a high compliment to his abilities as an actor and I hope he tackles a work with more depth in the future.

  Washington and Martinez are the only two bright spots amid a sea of performances so contrived and by the numbers that none of them are given enough unique meat to their dialogue or characters to make any impression whatsoever. The same can be said for the surprisingly sparse scenes of uninspired and dull action on screen and the equally tired and predictable finale.

  The cinematography is appropriately grim and Fuqa is confident in his style, even if it doesn't work here, but at 132 minutes the motion picture could've easily lost twenty to thirty minutes and helped the pace, and thus given some life to the proceedings,  tremendously. As it is the movie is bloated, overlong, offers nothing any different from the multitude of blue collar justice films before it and therefore will fade into silence and quickly from popular memory. It's a waste of the talent at hand's time as well as the audience.",1420070400,2,2566,4.974299065420561
6536434,3,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel is always a great actor. This film could have been an hour longer to show a little more of the take-downs and build some more tension and plot.

6536480,5,B00M0GM4DS,"For my short review: watch this movie, cross between Taken and Shooter.

We all know what we're getting into watching this movie. The story line is smarter than your average shoot em' up film as Denzel does his thing as a sharp man with a cloudy past (definitely some sort of military/combat training), obsessive compulsive disorder, and empathy for victims of our cruel world. He seems to be getting along just fine workout violence in his life anymore, now working at a home depot type store, positively interacting with his co workers and taking interest in their lives; helping them at times. He starts to ponder coming out of retirement, so to speak, as he sees innocents falling prey to those who take on a daily basis. The boiling point comes when he has to watch a young, forced prostitute, with dreams off being a singer, repeatedly get abused and mistreated by her boss and customers. Will he look the other way and keep his low key life? Or will he take a stand and before a protector? You can guess the answer to that question since a two hour movie about Washington ironing creases into his pants and organizing his book shelf wouldn't sell very well.",1420070400,,1164,4.6231884057971016

I like a movie that carries a strong message, a redeeming message of righteousness, justice, and vengeance. I like a movie that not only has incredible, well thought out action sequences, but demonstrates a high level of creativity in the process. Some call this ""Death Wish"". Consider it Death Wish X SAW X Taken X  Above The Law (and all the GOOD Steven Seagal movies). Yes, THAT is what this is. But for all the great action, it is lavishly shot. The scenes are shot with such attention to detail that you feel the rain, breathe the air, and live in the moment. THAT is what makes a movie SUPERIOR. If it can pull you out of your world and push you into its world, it is something of a unique and precious quality.  I really loved this movie for the transitional scenes of Boston. Like the movie Half Light, the movie captures real life in the most vivid of colors. The exterior and interior shots are clever and compelling. Of course, with Denzel in the lead, the acting is superb. Chloe Grace Moretz and the rest do a wonderful job. The script was well written and makes sense. You will be on your feet cheering by the end. I am so thankful to have the opportunity to view this fine movie and to share my humble thoughts with the Greatest Community on Earth. I love you all.

But when he meets a young girl (Moretz) under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her.

I never really watched the original TV series, so I only vaguely knew the premise of the original story, although this seems perfect for a big screen adaptation and the type of role that Denzel knows how to play and play well.  Although his role is a familiar one for him and the story a combination of the TV series and some of his recent movies (such as Safe House and Man on Fire), the story of the man helping those in need is compelling enough to watch.  Marton Csokas playing the main villain in the movie is brilliant in the cold calculated way he plays it.

The action is non-stop especially in the 2nd half of the movie and an entertaining watch.  It is a bit predictable of course as most action movies tend to be, but even knowing the outcome, I enjoyed it and most Denzel fans will as well.

6536657,4,B00M0GM4DS,"I purchased The Equalizer on the strength of Denzel Washington and the direction of Antoine Fuqua, as well as the supposed ""retro action"" feel. I was not disappointed. This is a solid action film with great characters and a strong, violent sense of action. If you like retro style revenge flicks you can't go wrong here.

Denzel is always reliable and he does great work here. The main character is a morally conflicted veteran who forums a plan in seconds and executes that plan with ruthless efficiency. Washington plays all this out on his face with expressions, speaking only when he has to and his words feel almost like a punch themselves. There are scenes in this movie that stand up to the best drama writing and performance, like the diner scene between Washington and a young female friend who sets him on his path, or a stunning verbal confrontation near the end between Washington and the film's main villain.

The whole film reminds you of when action movies were as much about the characters and words as they were the explosions. When the action does come, it comes hard. This film isn't as gory as true 80's classics, but it's much more visceral than most modern action fare. You feel the stabbings, you flinch when someone gets a glass to the eye. The action hitting you as hard as it does underlines the sense of righteous anger, as does Washington's barely subdued expressions of inner rage.

The blu ray is great to look at, as any new release film should be. Crisp detail, excellent blacks. There is a scene toward the end of the movie, depicted on the cover, that looks amazing on blu ray. Sound is strong, very good dynamic range without blowing the roof off randomly. Be aware of a strong bass line during the action scenes that is stronger than the rest of the soundtrack. Special features are the normal fare for a newer movie, a few featurettes that cover things in a promotional way. The standout for me was ""rage mode,"" which is Denzel and Fuqua talking about the scene you're about to watch before you watch it. They make some interesting and fun comments, and you can skip directly to these interview scenes if you want to.

Overall I was very happy with my purchase of The Equalizer. If you're into retro 70's and 80's style action and revenge flicks of a the more serious nature then you will probably love The Equalizer. On top of being a solid and visceral action film it also has great writing and performances which bring a movie like this to a higher level.",1419984000,,2495,4.5874439461883405

6536696,5,B00M0GM4DS,"An action movie with skillful characterization, perfect pacing, and amazing violence.  ""Robert"" is one of my new American heroes, right beside John McClane and John Rambo.  The film brings you closer to Robert in small, meaningful scenes.  His small acts of kindness trigger greater and greater evils that only he can overcome.  Evil forces push and push until  the true Robert has to be unleashed.  The black ops Robert.

The acting is superb all around.  The characters are realistic, living realistic lives.  The dialogue is never corny--always down-to-earth, interesting, and true to character.  The bad guys are ALWAYS way more powerful and frightening than Robert.  Watching our hero overcome a lot of dangerous situations is exciting and tense.  In fact, get ready to rewind and re-watch some bloody fun scenes.

Worth buying if you love realistic action movies.  No flips and over-the-top antics.  Just brutal hand-to-hand, knife to throat, stabby to stabby goodness.  Also, you will never view your local hardware store the same way again.

The ending is a bit vague, but I think it may just set up the possibility for a sequel or ten.  Hopefully.

EXCELLENT film.  BUY IT.",1419984000,,1182,5.057291666666667

6536856,3,B00M0GM4DS,"As an action movie, this one is quite enjoyable.  It's light material, to be sure, but the story is serviceable to set up the action scenes, and Denzel carries them off well.

The problem is, this movie is called ""The Equalizer"", but except for the title and the character name ""Robert McCall"", there's nothing here that's about the Equalizer.

A quick history lesson.  ""The Equalizer"" was an eighties TV show about a British spy who spent three decades working for the American government.  Then, fed up with all the Cold War espionage, he decides to retire and do penance by helping people in need.  To sum up the concept in one sentence, the series was ""James Bond in semi-retirement"".  Or more accurately, it was star Edward Woodward reprising his role in the British spy series ""Callan"", except during his retirement years.  Aside from helping average people against gangsters and other criminals, he also occasionally got pulled back into the spy game, very reluctantly.

But while there was violence, the action was spy stuff, not military.  When McCall needed heavier force, he relied on others to supply it.  He almost never used anything except a little Walther PPK/S, like James Bond.  His real weapons were psychological, as he manipulated his enemies into mistakes.

That's where the movie fails terribly.  Denzel Washington is a military man here, not a suave former spy straight out of the sixties.  So the movie fails to capture the most essential spirit of the character it seeks to adapt to film.  That's not a good thing.",1419984000,7,1540,4.888030888030888
6536857,5,B00M0GM4DS,Great movie! Denzel though so it is to be expected.,1419984000,,51,4.2
6536888,5,B00M0GM4DS,"First, I just want to say how proud I was to see Denzel and the director Mr. Fuqua collaborate on another film since Training Day. This movie had several good scenes and a plot that makes you want to take out the trash in your own town. I especially liked the scenes between Denzel and the main villain. The sounds, lighting, and tone of the movie was pretty spectacular. Im really happy with this movie. I also liked John Wick that recently came out. This has been an awesome winter that enabled me to see 2 different movies with my favorite actors. I highly recommend both movies.",1419984000,,582,4.4485981308411215
6536889,2,B00M0GM4DS,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is Denzel Washington who gives an outstanding performance (as usual). The movie was done with way too many very darkly lit scenes. It may be that the writer, producer, director (any or all of the above) felt that his would add an artsy touch or it may simply have been to save money in production costs. The sound was of poor quality as well and the Blu-Ray disk I purchased gave my Blu-Ray player fits causing it to cut-out and come back numerous times (30 to 40) during the movie. Each time it cut out, the Blu-Ray player seemed to be searching for or trying to pin-down how it wanted to play (1080p or what). My guess is that they wanted to put this movie out as cheaply as possible to maximize their profit margin, The problem is they did so on the backs of the customers. Go see this at your local theater but don't spend the money to purchase it for home. ""Man on Fire"" starring Denzel Washington was a similar but far, far superior film and they did not try to make a buck on the customer's back!",1419984000,3,1045,4.23
6536890,5,B00M0GM4DS,"""The Equalizer"" is great! This is how the story goes: McCall, a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. But when McCall meets Teri, a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer.

The cast led by Denzel Washington (also produced) (terrific as usual as Robert McCall) is great. The directing by Antoine Fuqua is great. The story & screenplay (based on the TV series created by Richard Lindheim & Michael Sloan, Sloan also produced the film) by Richard Wenk (also produced) is great.

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is great. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore is great. The film editing by John Refoua is great. The casting by Mary Vernieu & Lindsay Graham is great. The production design by Naomi Shohan is great. The art direction by David Lazan is great. The set decoration by Leslie E. Rollins, set dressings by Christopher Analoro, Risa Uchida Battis, Brian Buckley, Rachel Burgio, Mickey Carter, James Champoux, Jonathan Champoux, Gregory J. Corcoran, Wayne Kimball, Eric Matheson, Katrina Parsons, Adam Roffman, Timothy Rowcroft & Richard Sepulveda, set designs by Amy Heinz-Barrett, Sarah Contant & Jeremy Woodward is great. The costume design by David C. Robinson is great. The stunts coordinated by Keith Woulard & Lin Oeding is great. The special make-up effects by Howard Berger & Gregory C. Funk is great. The special effects coordinated by Jack Lynch is great. The visual effects coordinated by E.M. Bowen & Alyssa Frankel & supervised by Sean Devereaux & Marc D. Rienzo is great.

This is a great and entertaining action thriller that is well-done and well-made (well-crafted, as well, too). This is also a great film adaptation to a TV series, as well, too. This is also a great reunion from Denzel Washington (terrific, yet again, in another well-crafted performance) & Antoine Fuqua, 13 years in the making after ""Training Day"". This is also a great set-up to a possible franchise, as well. This is (or was) one of the best films of the fall season and also one of the best action films of the year.",1419984000,,2497,4.884433962264151

Sure, it wasn't written and directed by Christopher Nolan or based on a novel by Robert Ludlum. But this is still a great thrill-ride. This movie is kind of a Bourne/Batman flick with hints of Taken.

The prostitute with a heart of gold and voice of silver I guess wants to not be a prostitute and to be a singer.

6537156,2,B00M0GM4DS,"Reteaming Denzel Washington with his TRAINING DAY director Antoine Fuqua seems like a no-brainer for getting solid performances as well as a well-plotted, strongly-structured, tight action thriller. However, this unnecessarily gritty and unrelentingly dark 21st century reboot of the popular 1980's Edward Woodward television show is done without any joy in its cold, cold heart and that translates to having zero fun watching Denzel dispatch dozens of bad guys.

Denzel is Robert McCall, a quiet man who spends his days working at a Home Depot-like store where he helps the nice pudgy guy become the store security guard and his sleepless nights reading books and drinking tea at a greasy spoon diner frequented by young working girl Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz). Once she is beaten badly, McCall begins a quest of vengeance against the Russian mobster responsible for her beating that leads him to rely on his ""special set of skills"" he swore upon his deceased wife that he would never use again. Suddenly, McCall finds himself the target of a sociopathic Russian mob enforcer (Martin Czokas) intent on hunting him down all while McCall starts helping all sorts of other people around him.

Fuqua, who started his career in film with a bang bringing Asian action god Chow Yun Fat to the US with THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, cemented his status with TRAINING DAY, followed by a string of hits and misses in equal proportion with films like TEARS OF THE SUN, SHOOTER, BROOKLYN'S FINEST, and OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN hits the skids again with this existential cousin to Denzel's finest actioner MAN ON FIRE. The film works with far too much of a slow burn as we watch Denzel go through his days and nights giving no real momentum or anticipation to his eventual return to a man of action. I have no issues with Denzel in this film, though. He's one of the few actors working that always seems to have something going on behind his eyes, but make no mistake; this is HIS film. No other characters are given any real kind of arc for a film almost two and a half hours in length. The final fight is incredibly clumsy, unnecessarily gory, and tonally off-kilter. It wants you to root for McCall, but it also seems to enjoy making the methods he uses to dispatch his foes as brutal and bloody as possible. Easily the worst and clumsiest part of the film is McCall returning to some old friends from ""The Agency"" (Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo), who pack unnecessary and momentum-crushing exposition in their scene together.

I don't really know who THE EQUALIZER was supposed be for, audience-wise. It seems to be appealing to the TAKEN crowd as another aging actor maintains his badassery for a long time, but it also is nothing like the show, other than being about a former government agent using his skills to protect and help people. It's certainly not playing to the nostalgia angle. While this film could have been at least a half-hour shorter, it also could have been a lot more entertaining and interesting to see them play this with more of a gleam in its eyes rather than a blood-spattered darkness.",1419811200,2,3091,4.784644194756554

6537242,4,B00M0GM4DS,"""One day somebody does something unspeakable to someone else, to someone you hardly knew, and you do something about it cause you can."" Robert McCall (Washington) is a mild mannered employee at HomeMart. He spends his days helping his friends and spends his nights reading at a cafe where he talks to Teri (Moretz), a call girl. Robert like to live a quiet life but when he sees wrongs he fixes them the only way he knows how. When something happens to Teri he decides he can't sit back any longer and unleashes his own brand of justice. I had pretty high expectations for this movie because Denzel Washington doesn't make bad movies. I have to admit that I did really enjoy this and I highly recommend this but it was a little slow in some parts. The only real flaw with the movie is that is seemed to start in the middle and you are trying to play catch up for the first half. That said I did kind of like that rather than being spoon-fed the plot like most movies do. On the other hand this is yet another movie that Liam Neeson usually does, this one has a different actor. I thought Man On Fire was better but this was still very good. If you are into vigilante justice movies like Boondock Saints then you will like this. I did and I recommend this. Overall, a good movie that was just a few steps away from being great. I give this a high B+.",1419811200,,1349,4.252918287937743

6537779,2,B00M0GM4DS,"Has 59 yr old Denzel Washington finished killing off the rest of the Putin's Russian army or what? Taking on forty guys in the movie and killing them all without so much as a scratch or paper cut, is a little cliched if you ask me. His character has a fondness for power tools and equipment at the local hardware store...great. His character is virtually untouchable and easily whips everyone's ass in the movie just like knocking down a bunch of dominos, yeah right. I know it's only a movie but let's have some kind of realism in it please. I think we have, all seen this before from him like the movie Man On Fire, and even that movie had more of a realistic ending. Don't get me wrong I love Denzel greatly He is a very talented two time Oscar winning actor, you are not going to get another talent like him any time soon in Hollywood, but he needs to go back do more mature drama oriented movies.",1419638400,3,901,4.2748538011695905

Reason for one star was Hollywood raised the price of the movie almost 35% of what it used to cost you.  You used to get a box set with Blu-ray disc, dvd disc, and a digital copy for about  $29.  Now you only can buy a one disc dvd or a one disc Blu-ray.  If you want to buy both the total is about$15 for dvd and  $29 for Blu-ray, which equals $45. Plus no more digital copy.  Hollywood has raised their prices.  I guess everyone making a $60 million dollar movie was making  minium wage. The wage went up, prices go up.",1419379200,,608,4.042016806722689

Spoiler: (maybe)
I don't recall the movie ever revealing who or what Washingtons character used to be or work for, but refers to it as the, ""Agency."" The FBI is not an agency and focuses on investigation, so it leaves only one other possibility to my mind.

6539021,4,B00M0GM4DS,"What else can be said about Denzel that has not been spoken already, often so repetitively that it just becomes standard to view him as Standing Room Only? This take on the hit TV series with the same name, is executed very, very well and I will be extremely surprised if a follow up is not done in the next few years. Denzel's performance is so strong, as expected, and if you have not yet seen The Equalizer, his portrayal of ""Do it, Don't do it"" comes through very effectively with the quick, repeated opening, then closing of a door. You'll recognize it so don't worry about missing the moment: it is pure genius. Whether this was written in the script or if Denzel intuitively performed this action, it is simply masterful. In a nutshell, it is undoubtedly worth the money, as my wife asked me the very next day, ""Are you going to watch it again?"" Of course. As a side note, the very beautiful yet extremely subtle references to Michael Jackson were brilliantly included and perhaps I saw these due to the Renaissance I have been enjoying for nearly a year now. He is still making his presence known, but in a movie such as this, I never would have expected it. But it should not come as a shock when we consider that he, both within a group and then as an individual, stayed in The Zone for 5 decades with his music. That is not the sum total of M.J., just the greater portion of him that the public was able to, or better yet, allowed to see.",1419033600,,1449,4.330882352941177

This genre is getting way too familiar and guys getting long in tooth kicking the carp out of all the ""bad guys"" half their age but with half a brain, if at that. We have now seen the resurrection of aging male actors (Liam Neeson of Taken franchise, Keanu Reeves in Johnny Wick, Pierce Brosnan in November Man, Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher, as well as Arnold, Sly, and others all killing their way thru waves of most incompetent baddies around (notice how the Russian mob is the flavor of the month now for dumb baddies?). Yes, the action is well choreographed in these movies and the blood lets out in all it's glory in most imaginative ways. A female character, if there is one, is always a marginal character who is basically an excuse for justifying the mayhem or is a side note of little importance. I actually are not negative towards these movies - they're decent entertainment, well made (forget the acting - you can interchange one old geezer for another without missing a beat, or a beating). However, NONE of them deserve 5-stars, and most don't deserve a four either. Laying waste to bad guys in creative ways shouldn't be confused with cinematic excellence - ones who do must be related to all the low IQ baddies in these movies.",1418947200,8,1325,4.61864406779661

This vigilante-style film was very straightforward, largely lacking the darkness of Man on Fire (apologies for the repeated comparisons, but I know many Denzel fans will have seen that previous film and therefore be able to easily relate to this review in that way). In this movie, he simply (like the TV series) simply cannot walk away from the wrongs that he feels he must right.

It was perfectly paced and action packed but not so much so that it was void of story. The story was detailed even though Washington's character ""Robert"" remains somewhat ambiguous and mysterious except for the fact that he is seemingly meek and works at Home Mart!

Co star Chloe Grace Moritz was really good in her role as the under aged prostitute who's assault pushes Robert to the breaking point and causes him to enter the world of the Russian mafia. Melissa Leo has a small role and she's always good plus the main villain was very easy to root against and hate .

Other than the fact that Chloe Moretz was completely under used in her role, This was a movie that had enough character development and action to get you engaged in the story. I rated it 4 stars and not 5 because you really never get all the back story on the most interesting character played by Denzel. And Chloe was only in the very beginning and literally the very end. Probably a total of 4 minutes of screen time for an amazing actress. I would welcome a part 2 that explores his past, while still pushing the story forward.

The film is fairly entertaining, violent, and, overall, worth the watch.  Unfortunately I did not think the film was that great.  It was overly long and the story was very predictable.  If you saw Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Segal films from years past, you will not be surprised by the plot twists.  You will also not be shocked by how cartoonish the bad guys are.

What I found most ludicrous is Denzel just walks into dangerous places unarmed and is, somehow, able to take a gun away from a bad guy and then handle business.  After a awhile, one has to ask why Denzel cannot make his job a lot easier by just carrying a damn firearm.

Overall this film is three stars.  Overall, it will keep you entertained, but you will be reminiscing about those old Segal and Van Damme films.",1418256000,19,1012,4.475409836065574

6539201,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington is THE EQUALIZER. Finally we get a real blunt Instrument. Denzel Washington is the equalizer and he gets the job done for the underdog. I love this film. Under director Antoine Fuqua's facade of highly stylized gloss is a gritty world where the bad guys lurk and these guys are the baddest of the bad. There is brutal carnage everywhere when Denzel Washington brings them down. Denzel Washington is Robert McCall. Robert McCall is a man of peace today, but there is violence in his past and his future. Robert McCall is the EQUALIZER.

This film is based on the television series The Equalizer of 88 episodes that ran from 1985 to 1989. In the series a former covert operations officer for the ""Agency"" named Robert McCall and played by Edward Woodward ran a newspaper ad: ""Odds against you? Need help? Call the Equalizer. 212 555 4200."" Basically, The Equalizer helped people who could not get help or for whom the system simply could not help. That's where the Equalizer stepped in. In the series the ""Agency"" would always pop up from time to time. Was McCall completely out of the agency or not? In the series McCall always came up against the baddest of the bad. A lot of the violence was implied because of the constraints of the television medium but the audience always wanted to see these bad guys put down. McCall was essentially a blunt instrument getting the job done and we all loved it.

Now we move up to the present and in this version we get a no-holds-barred Robert McCall in the person of Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington posses a personality and has a screen presence that is so winning that no matter violent he takes down the bad guys we cheer him on. When there is no one to help, you need a blunt instrument to get the job done and Denzel Washington truly is Robert McCall getting the job done. In the television series Edward Woodward gave us a kinder and gentler McCall. Here, Denzel Washington plays a Robert McCall who is as equally lethal as the brutal Russian mobsters he takes on.",1414800000,4,2032,4.595041322314049

6539203,5,B00M0GM4DS,This is a remake of the 80s TV character done by Edward Woodward. Denzel makes the character over in his own image and I think this is probably Denzel Washington's best movie yet. Do not go there expecting to see a black version of Edward Woodward. In the original TV series McCall was a 60-something retired CIA operative who still dabbled in company business to support his non paying gig of helping out those in helpless situations. He was a good shot with a pistol and pretty fair in hand to hand combat for a man his age but he got most of his advantage by outsmarting the enemy. Denzel Washington is mesmerizing in front of the camera and the way he quickly sizes up a room and all it's sources of potential weapons adds to the overall excitement of the movie but it is a different take on the original theme,1414368000,5,814,4.3618421052631575

6539230,4,B00M0GM4DS,"There is a long, long, slow burn happening in ""The Equalizer"", the new film from director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"", ""Olympus Has Fallen"") and writer Richard Wenk (""The Expendables 2"", ""The Mechanic (2011)). Based on the television series starring Edward Woodward, ""The Equalizer"" gives star Denzel Washington the chance to build a unique, immensely watchable character, someone we really feel we know something about. Because we have this connection to Robert McCall (Washington), when he starts battling the bad guys we are much more invested in the outcome and the film becomes more exciting.

It's not like we ever suspect Washington's McCall is in mortal danger - this is the type of film just made for a sequel and they aren't going to kill off the star and ruin the chance for future installments. But the fact that you actually feel some suspense as he battles the bad guys shows you how successfully the star and director have been in creating this new character.

For maybe the first half of the film, a lot of film time is spent showing us McCall's life and routines. He is a very organized man and believes everything has a place; after he uses a fork, he puts it back in precisely the same place. We watch him at work, at a home improvement warehouse store, sort of a goodwill ambassador to the rest of the team. He knows everyone and they know him, ready and willing to joke with him. McCall also takes people under his wing, helping them achieve the goals they set. His current project is Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), one of Robert's co-workers who aspires to become a security guard at the DIY store. McCall takes him out for training, monitors his diet to help him lose extra weight, gives him pep talks.

Part of Robert's routine includes coping with insomnia , so he regularly treks out at 2am in the morning to a dive cafe, to have a cup of tea and read books from a list of 100 Books You Must Read Before You Die, a list his wife started before she dies, titles like The Old Man and the Sea"". Because he is a regular, he is well known by the other regulars including Teri (Chlo Grace Moretz), a young prostitute who comes in every night, after servicing clients, to have something to eat. One night, Teri's pimp, Slavi (David Meunier, TV's ""Justified"") tracks her down, upset because she hit a client who hit her. The next night, Robert learns Teri is in the hospital due to extensive injuries. Being a man of the world, McCall is able to put two and two together and confronts the pimp and his henchmen. McCall demonstrates he has some deep training in some nasty skills. Teddy (Martin Csokas, TV's ""Falcon"", ""The Debt""), Slavi's boss, arrives in town to find out who took out his men and to extract revenge. Teddy quickly finds McCall and they engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse .

The best thing about ""The Equalizer"" is the set-up of Robert McCall's life. We watch as Washington shows us what seems to be every move in his daily life. It is strange, but not unwelcome, for an action film to take this much time to introduce us to this character. Because we spend so much time with him, watching his mannerisms and routines, we feel a greater intimacy with him  it doesnt really feel like an introduction, you feel like you are living with him. And this makes the moment when he kicks into action and begins to use his skills to help others even more memorable . When his fists begin flying and the weapons come out, this apparently new side of him doesn't seem so strange or jarring; we know a lot about him by this point and we more or less accept he has an amazing skill set.

It is nice to have this time with a character, any character really, but because the character is played by Denzel Washington, we are spending time with someone who is at a higher skill level than many. And director Fuqua lets the camera linger as we spend this time with him, almost as though we are watching some of the action through his eyes, sharing his POV. As McCall gets ready for work, he sits at a table in his clean but rather sparse apartment and finishes his tea. He puts the fork back, wipes the tables, takes the dishes to the sink. Washes, then dries them, putting them in the drainer. Then he takes the same bus to work, arriving on time for his job every single day. Every evening, he spends time at the diner, taking a tea bag carefully wrapped in a napkin from his home with him. As the diner owner pours the hot water, he carefully unwraps the tea bag and drops it into the water. We see each of these routines a few times allowing us to see they are very practiced and each step has been repeated many times.

Washington seems to be doing all of this to help us realize McCall is trying to use these routines as a method of maintaining his sanity in life, to keep thoughts of past deeds as bay. Also, it seems to take some time for Robert to jump back into action. When he realizes Teri has been hit and abused by one of her clients, he doesn't say or do anything. He talks to Teri like nothing has happened. It takes a little more to push him back into action. And when he finally commits to help her, we can see the wheels turning as he remembers the skill sets he once used so easily.

McCall makes an initial play with Slavi, but when that doesn't yield any results, he takes things up a notch. And this begins a game of cat and mouse  that becomes increasingly dangerous for all parties involved.

It is one of Washington's better performances of late because he seems fully invested in the role. When many actors begin to receive super huge paychecks, they usually take on the same types of roles again and again, and this leads to them phoning in some of their performances. This happens less frequently with Washington, but it happens. With Robert McCall, he seems to be putting his acting skills through their paces again.

Chlo Grace Moretz is very good as Teri, but it is a smaller role than she has been doing lately. She manages to bring us into Teri's mind for a while and we get to know her a little before she is victimized and becomes a cause for Robert.

David Meunier is good as Slavi. The role is what it is; he needs to be a dog in order for Robert to kick into action. And he is just that, a dog. David Harbour plays Masters, a detective who works with Teddy. Masters has a few moments with McCall and the two play well off one another. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo pop up late in the film as a retired power couple McCall turns to for help and information.

Another sign of the skill involved in this film is that all of these various story elements actually come together. The time spent at the diner, McCalls efforts to help train and mentor Ralphie, the crooked cop Masters, all play a part in Roberts life and the overall story. This may seem like a given, but all too often elements like these are simply introduced and then abandoned as the star gets involved in the machinations of the action plot. In The Equalizer, they play a part in how Robert reacts to everyone else.

But ""The Equalizer"" is really about the battle between Teddy and McCall. Both are very determined to stop the other and both engage in a battle of wits to become the victor. It is a credit to the filmmakers that they manage to convince us that McCall doesn't always have all the answers, all the skills to undo his opponent.

Martin Csokas is very good as Teddy. He is frightening, intelligent and moves quickly, determined to achieve his goal. When he first meets Robert, he knows he has the right guy, just on his hunch, but he continues to look for information, to make sure he has the right guy before he begins setting fire to everything.

Throughout the film, Fuqua keeps things escalating at a nice rate. McCall doesn't just let the action happen. It takes a while to get to this point, but when McCall begins to engage Teddy, the action moments start off small and build giving us a more suspenseful film.

What they build to is my least favorite part of the film. The inevitable big showdown between McCall and Teddy happens in a place special to Robert. It has to. Teddy flies in from out of town, so the setting has to be unfamiliar to him, to give Robert a bit of an edge. The people closest to Robert also have to become involved, to make the danger more personal for the quiet, unassuming hero. When this section of the film begins to click into place, it begins to seem much more routine, much more expected, like it should be in an action film starring Bruce Willis or Dwayne Johnson. This final battle still has some interesting bits, some unusual, unexpected moments that serve to hold our attention, but it also serves to draw us out of the cocoon of Robert McCall's life and remind us we are essentially watching what could be a very routine action film.

While it is a disappointment that the ending is not a little more unexpected, Fuqua and Washington do create another interesting, compelling and very watchable portrait of a man willing to help those in need. And for that reason, The Equalizer is worth watching.",1413331200,5,9076,4.437575030012005

If you want to see a movie with good action, a guy that is able to protect the good people and take out the bad guys in hast, then this is the movie for you.

6539266,5,B00M0GM4DS,"The 1980's TV series ""The Equalizer"" gets a terrific movie reboot courtesy of director Antoine Fuqua and lead actor Denzel Washington.  Washington is Robert McCall, mild-mannered older worker in a Home Mart store in Boston, Massachusetts, who helps out his fellow workers.  McCall has an insomnia problem and reads books in an all-night caf.  He takes an interest in a young girl, a prostitute who works from the diner and who gets roughed up by her pimp.  An encounter with the Russian pimp leads to the revelation, if the viewer hasn't already figured it out, that mild-mannered Robert is a retired CIA operative with deadly skills.  The pile of bodies in the pimp's office will bring the unwelcome attention of the Russian mob, in the form of an absolutely ruthless enforcer.  It's game on, with all Boston as the playing field and the Russian mob against Robert and his few allies.

The plot will be familiar for those who remember the television show or have even seen a recent Liam Neeson movie.  However, the fun is in watching Denzel Washington absolutely inhabit the role as a reluctant yet lethally effective guardian angel.

I didn't see the original TV series so I had no expectations for the film. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot details, so I won't get into it much. Like many such vigilante-hero movies, McCall is a man with a mysterious past. Mild-mannered Home Mart employee by day, insomniac by night, he is an incorrigible do-gooder, righting wrongs and bringing justice to those who prey upon the defenseless, often with fatal consequences for the offending individuals. We don't know much about his history, but we do know that he once had a wife and is a highly-trained former military operative with has some friends in very high places (cameo by Bill Pullman). He lives alone, with monk-like asceticism. It's a lot of fun watching the details of his life, his OCD compulsions, like timing the washing of his dishes, and his meticulous folding of a tea bag into a paper napkin, which he brings to the local diner where he reads the top 100 classics of English literature, one book at a time. Very early on, we find out he has a heart of gold, and this is what gets him into trouble and escalating to a confrontation with a Russian organized criminal empire. The good characters are very likable (like Ralphie, his overweight co-worker) and the bag guys utterly detestable.

McCall is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, covert operations, explosives, electronic surveillance, subterfuge, and a whole lot of other tricks. (Seriously, don't mess with this guy.) Even though he is adept with firearms, he prefers to get up close and personal. Expect to see a lot of creative uses of ""non-traditional"" combat weapons, like corkscrews, bags of cement, and home contractor hardware. The final showdown in the Home Mart is a lot of fun to watch, and I won't spoil it for you. I'll just say that the gun you see in the cliche movie poster is not the kind of gun you think it is. There were some Arnold-worthy one-liner opportunities in the film, but fortunately, McCall didn't utter them. Some of the action sequences are slow-mo and flinch-worthy with some nasty exit wounds. As with all such movies, the hero is seemingly bullet-proof, so some suspension of disbelief is required for full enjoyment. There aren't any truly suspenseful moments where the survival of the protagonist and his friends are ever in doubt for longer than a minute. There are also some subtle elements of humor in the movie, like McCall running by the bad guys and taking cellphone photos of them.

Lastly, I'd just like to say that I'm glad to see Denzel in this role. I liked him a lot in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Eli/dp/B003KRJNBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Eli</a>&nbsp;as another silent but deadly hero. Originally slated for Russell Crow, this movie would've been a lot different. It's also good to see an African-American action hero, a demographic that is under-represented in the genre.

This was a smart, fun, taut action film. The movie ends with an obligatory hint at a sequel, which I'll gladly go see if Fuqua is at the helm again. I saw this with 5 other teachers of various ages from 30's-60's, men and women, and we all had a good time.

I was hesitant to watch this. The trailer looked silly in parts. But, I figured Denzel rarely makes bad movies, and I had an itch for an action drama. Very glad I gave this movie a chance. IMO - worth watching in the theaters.

The action scenes, as silly as they may look in the trailers, work really well. Entertaining to say the least.

The pacing of the movie, establishing of the characters, and plot development were done well.

My wife and I are in our thirties. We took my parents, who are in their 60s. We all really enjoyed this movie. The action keeps it entertaining, Denzel's character is interesting, and Denzel's acting is mesmerizing (as usual).

While critics have mixed reviews (as can be seen on rotten tomatoes, which rated it 61% as of this review date), audiences seem to really enjoy this movie (Amazon average 4.6, through 18 reviews, as of this review date). Also, I believe audience polls were very highly rated.

 Yes, this movie is based on the popular TV show of the same name.  The show ran for 88 episodes from 1985 through 1989.  The quietly powerful actor Edward Woodward played Robert McCall, a retired spook who spent his time as a private detective who helped people out of dangerous jams.  The popular show won a golden globe and had a good run for five years.
 In the movie version, quietly powerful actor Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, a retired spook who works anonymously in a Home Depot type of super store.  He exhibits a calm cheerfulness and radiates a benign and wise good humor to his fellow workers.  But all is not entirely well with the retired intelligence agent.  For one thing, he can't sleep very much.  Guilty conscience we would think.  He has as his routine a lengthy very early morning stop at the corner diner to read for a while as he waits the time to take his bus to work.  A very young hooker makes his acquaintance, which changes his quite retirement.
 Chloe Grace Moretz has not as yet quite achieved her 18th birthday but has racked up an impressive record in Hollywood.  The Equalizer is her second major motion picture in 2014 after the recent successful tear jerker If I Stay.  She had another four roles in 2014 and we still have three months to go before the end of the year.  She played Hit Girl, a super hero vigilante, in the two successful Kick Ass action comedies and a vampire in the tragic Let Me In.  She has skills.  She plays the innocent victim in The Equalizer and isn't asked to do any great acting but we know she can act if the script calls for it.  We think of Moretz as an up and comer as an actress and look forward to seeing her in the upcoming Dark Places and The Fifth Wave.  She does stay busy, which we admire in up and coming actresses.  Writer Richard Wenk wrote the role of Teri, the immigrant sex slave, for an adult woman but director Antoine Fuqua liked Moretz so much that he changed things to use her in the role.
 When Teri, the too young hooker, gets in trouble with her brutal Russian mafia bosses, McCall  must put aside his quiet, peaceful retirement to help the youngster out.  Denzel Washington remains one of the half dozen most watchable actors working today.  His recent films include Inside Man, American Gangster (I still cannot believe he got snubbed by the Oscar committee), the amazing The Book of Eli, Safe House (which I gave a gold star for best on screen death scene), Flight-a tale of heroism and moral complexity and the entertaining action buddy movie 2 Guns.  In the first of several confrontations McCall glances at his watch and says to himself 16 seconds.  What he means is that he allows himself that length of time to dispatch five armed Russian gangsters, starting from scratch with no weapons of his own.  Denzel acts with such a certitude that we absolutely believe he can do it.  Even in retirement McCall is one of the most dangerous men in the world.
 And we have fun watching him do his magic on behalf of very ordinary people, his fellow big box workers who also need his help.
 I am just glad that Denzel Washington took the role of Robert McCall rather than the originally chosen Russell Crowe.  I have nothing against Crowe as an actor but Washington did a great job.  Director Antoine Fuqua had directed a string of successful and entertaining action flicks.  His work includes Olympus has Fallen, King Arthur, The Replacement Killers and his artistic masterpiece-also staring Denzel Washington- Training Day.
 Writer Richard Wenk also has experience and success with action films.  He scribed the tense 16 Blocks and the laughable but popular The Expendables 2.
 The Equalizer ranks at top level for action movies and rates a solid four saw blades.  It stands to be a good earner with the $55 million budget matched with a Friday-Monday take worldwide of $51 million.  Writer Richard Wenk and star Denzel Washington helped produce the film.  It runs a good long two hours and 8 minutes.  The very bad language and serious violence earn this movie a strong R rating.
 Melissa Leo has a supporting role in the film.  She also appeared in one of the episodes of the TV series way back in the 80's.
 Washington and director Fuqua should make more films together.",1412035200,2,4284,4.587615283267457

6539291,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washingtons The Equalizer quietly crept up on movie theaters like his character Robert McCall did in the movie. There wasn't a whole lot of buzz or hype, just a simple acknowledgement that one of the most reliable film stars in the world was once again at the helm of a film. The less you know about Robert McCall before going into the movie, the better.

The Equalizer is a pretty simple movie to explain and it isn't anything new or ground-breaking. Robert McCall is a simple man, living a quiet life with few belongings and a blue-collar job at a tool and garden type store. Events slowly begin to work their way into his life that change his mild-mannered course and an Antoine Fuqua action movie materializes.

Fuqua sort of jumped ship after his breakthrough film Training Day in 2001, but has since returned to relatively decent form with his last two works; Olympus has Fallen and now The Equalizer. The thing I like about Fuquas last two movies is that instead of relying on the ridiculous, like has become the norm in Hollywood, Fuqua tries his best to keep things grounded in reality. Even when it gets ridiculous, and it does, it is still feasible and believable. This is the best part about The Equalizer for most of the film.

Denzel Washington brings an extremely interesting and complicated character to a slow and careful realization. As his character becomes more and more involved, the layers that begin to show are the bait and switch to the entire movie and its premise. At 59-years old, he proves that he can still carry an action movie.

The movie is gifted with some outstanding strategy and well-thought out tactics but unfortunately they went a little overboard in the finale. What was a pretty crafty and intelligent filmed cheapened itself with a bunch of gimmicks that we used to see in 80s Stallone action movies. While these gimmicks weren't the end all to the film, they kept the movie from being better.",1411948800,6,1943,4.705882352941177
6539292,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Denzel Washington who plays Robert McCall in this 1980's TV show reboot, must have been closely watching Liam Neeson haul in all that cash from his recent spate of action films.  After all, Denzel's not even 60 yet and Liam's 62.  Then of course there is all those ""Expendables.""  So what we have is a terrific action film with a calm, but lethal former CIA agent with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).

McCall, called Bob at his Home Depot-like job has a hard time sleeping, so he spends many of his very early morning hours at an all-night diner reading books and sipping tea.  But only after rearranging the table settings specifically to his liking.  There he meets a young hooker named Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is pimped out by a local Russian mob, run by Slavi (David Meunier).  Bob wants to help out Teri after her face is rearranged by one of her ""johns."" He goes to Slavi's restaurant/office and offers him $10K to free Teri from her servitude.  Once Slavi refuses and intimidates Bob, well, things don't go well for the Russkies.

With Bob's OCD, he calculates all his moves and uses a stop watch to see how close he comes to accomplishing his tasks.  It's fun to watch, as the camera focuses on Bob's eyes in addition to what he's seeing before going into action.  Bob has an aversion to guns it would seem, so he uses the bad guys own weapons along with whatever else is in the room to accomplish his tasks.  This becomes really fun during the final act inside the huge hardware store.

In between, meaner goons are sent in from Moscow, including a real badass in Teddy, a psycho, well played by Marton Csokas.  Bob has little trouble dispatching the underlings, but more come.  This is where the movie strains credulity.  Do we really think that these new guys are going to be any more effective, especially after the action takes place where Bob works?  Directed by Antoine Fuqua (""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""Training Day""), this is an unoriginal but well-made action flick and nothing else.  I would have liked to have seen minutes shaved off its 131 minute running time but in the end, Denzel Washington proves he's got just as much aging macho as any of those other guys.  Next stop?  Perhaps Putin.",1411948800,,2222,4.6055979643765905
6539293,5,B00M0GM4DS,"Danzel is at his BEST!  This is one of his most stunning performances ever.  In this role, Danzel is an unassuming character who is experiencing a low key existence after the love of his life has been taken from him.
Whatever is in your heart, it will show through your actions.  This is the epitome of the movie's storyline.  In other words, we can never change who we are.  We can only change our behavior.  Robert McCall is the person who tries to be a bystander on the sidelines of life but life has a number of different missions for us to follow.
The greatest battle between the two parallel (Good and Bad) adversaries took place in a restaurant while they were both sitting at a round dinner table.  The sparing that took place between them defined the movie itself.
The analogies between ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway, Don Quixote and Russian Tale were incredible.  The symbolisms utilized in this movie took it to another level of entertainment.
Take the time to see this movie and enjoy an intellectual and visually stunning experience.",1411948800,5,1062,4.641711229946524
6539294,4,B00M0GM4DS,"Trigger Warning(s): Depictions of torture and up close murders

It can be argued that when it comes to Black actors who are well established, like Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Samuel L. Jackson, and Forest Whitaker, that they all have found a certain comfort zone in their acting choices. However, while on paper it may make seeing them in similar roles over and over bland, while viewing the movie you often are reminded why they are allowed this amount of comfort in the first place. For while many will compare this film to Man on Fire, which honestly it only has similarities to since it is Denzel going on a rampage to save a white girl, that is where the comparisons begin and end.

Characters & Story

Robert (Denzel Washington) works at Home Depot and has found himself to be the father figure around the place. The young dudes idolize him, and want to know what he did before working there, the women find him attractive, and he treats them all with respect, a bit of charm and, whether asked or not, he will help them anyway possible. Like with Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), he helps him go from working the floor to being Home Depot security, and then with Teri, real name Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz), he helps her believe in herself, as well as give her a second chance. Something which isn't easy to do for with Teri being young, beautiful, and worth a lot of money, her pimp Slavi (David Meunier) doesnt want to let her go. So, Robert tries to help her. Thing is, as Robert tries to help her he gets involved with the whole business which got Teri to America in the first place. Meaning he has to climb the chain in order to regain any sense of peace in his life.

Leading to the main story of the film which deals with Robert taking on the Russian mafia, headed by Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Julich), a well-connected gangster, and his enforcer/ fixer Teddy (Marton Csokas). But, as well trained and talented as Robert is, he does show signs of aging. Leading you to wonder, in his quest to free one girl from human trafficking, how will he ultimately find peace? With a bullet in the head, but her free? With the snakes head cut off and him going back to being just an unknown face? Or will he find himself without peace for as he tries to climb the ladder, those he loved and wanted to protect end up falling off the roof?

Praise

In this film, Washington reminds you why his career spans over 30 years and why he is considered a legend in the film business. For while the story, as a whole, doesnt do anything drastically new or different from films with a similar premise, Washington puts his mark on it in such a way that he leaves you feeling the genre has found a new standard to live up to. For Robert is a man who you can see is conflicted about what he does, wants to create the sort of normalcy he sacrificed for most of his life, but at the same time he cant stop being the man who takes care of people when in need. Be it this kid at work who wants to be something more than he is, or this little girl who has lived a hard life but dreams that she can escape it and become better.

Now, as for the action elements of the movie, truly if you are squeamish you may want to be careful with this one for this is a violent movie. For with Robert having this Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr.s, version, of slowing down time to analyze things, and then really going all out, including using a wine opener to kill someone and us seeing the wine opener in the mouth of someone Robert just stabbed in the jaw, truly the film does get graphic.

And while Washington deserves much praise, I feel you must also praise Csokas too for being a credible villain. If just because his performance, and the build of his character, is so good you honestly think when him and Washington go one on one, there is a more likely chance of them both dying than Washington being alive after their battle. Something which is hard to do since Washington is at the point in his career where it almost feels like there won't be any surprises when it comes to his character. He is either going to live until the end or somehow come up on top. However, Csokas makes you question Washingtons celebrity having an effect on whether Robert will live or die.

Criticism

First and foremost, Im rather tired of Russian villains with the names Vladimir, Dmitri, and just Russian bad guys period. Its overdone, and at this point feels kind of lazy. Though the film in itself is very basic and only elevated due to strong performances. However, if anyone else was casted as Robert or Teddy, this film would probably be a straight to VoD release. Mostly because, as lovable as Robert is, you don't get any sort of concrete details about him. You learn he worked for the government, had a wife, but pretty much that is where things end. Robert, for the most part, is as unknown to us in the end as he was in the beginning.

Overall: Worth Seeing

Between Washington and Csokas, I feel future action crime thrillers need to take note. For as previously noted, this film takes all the basic elements very familiar to movie lovers and pushes the bar up. Leading to a Worth Seeing label from me.",1411862400,15,5175,4.407329842931937
