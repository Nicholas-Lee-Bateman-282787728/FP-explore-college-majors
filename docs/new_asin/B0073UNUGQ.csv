5053630,5,B0073UNUGQ,"If you like the cardio portion of Gilad's 45 minute Total Body Sculpt series, then you will LOVE this workout.  It's all jab, cross, uppercut, elbow, step, kick, etc.  I can feel this workout in my abs and back muscles, and it's also a great cardio workout.",1350259200,10,257,4.446808510638298

8509469,5,B0073UNUGQ,"When I did this workout for the first time, I had a little difficulty trying to get the moves right. But a few times through, and I rarely have any problem. It is a high energy kick-box workout. It starts with jab-cross, then adds on moves until it reaches a complex sequence. After fifteen minutes on one side, it is time to change sides and repeat the entire workout on the other side. Then, it is alternating, doing the exercise on one side, then hopping to the other and repeating there. The total is about 50 minutes that feel wonderful. The people doing the workout are on the beach, and having a great time.

After adding this to my other workouts, it has quickly become one of my favorites. I look forward to doing it a few times a week. I'm 65, retired, and and trying to fight off the ravages of aging. This workout is an important part of that.",1433635200,3,855,4.3105590062111805

8509471,3,B0073UNUGQ,this was not what I expected didn't fill my abs on fire,1406246400,,55,3.6666666666666665
8509472,5,B0073UNUGQ,I have been working out for a while with bodies in motion.....and this dvd has to be the most challenging cardio thus far..... you will sweat you will cry but trust me work out atleast 4 days a week and you will rule.  I normally switch from this dvd to elite forces to change up routine.  Give it a try,1402444800,,303,4.033333333333333
8509473,5,B0073UNUGQ,"I would not say my abs were on fire at the end of this work out.  If you want a 15 minute quick ab work out where you feel the pain, this is not for you.  If you want an enjoyable work out that does work the whole core without doing one sit-up this is for you.  It does work the abs as well as your sides, upper and lower back, arms, legs and light cardio with constant jump roping (without the rope).  You do a series of boxing type moves on the left side - first half of workout, than the right side, second half of work out.  I enjoy and would recommend the work out.  I use this and another ab work out by Gilad on a lighter work out day.",1401321600,4,642,3.789473684210526
8509474,3,B0073UNUGQ,"If I could keep up with this workout, I know it would be a good one. Unfortunately, it was hard for me to remember kick-box move to keep up.",1394409600,,140,3.8620689655172415
8509475,5,B0073UNUGQ,I have loved Gilad for over 20 years.  He's been my go to work out every week.  I loved Total Body Sculpt series and now love the Lord of the Abs series for added definition.  I am a runner so strengthening and core are paramount.  I truly believe that by doing his workouts my speed has improved dramatically.  Also everyone says they notice the definition in my slimmer body.  For a 55 year old woman that is empowering!,1393113600,,422,4.346153846153846
8509476,5,B0073UNUGQ,This is a really great exercise dvd.  I like most of them but the only thing I wish is that the others were a little longer (each aerobic exercise). This one is perfect.  He is easy enough to follow and this is a really good core/ab workout.,1383091200,2,241,4.1063829787234045
