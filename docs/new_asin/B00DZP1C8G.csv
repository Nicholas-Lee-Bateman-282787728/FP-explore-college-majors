8599478,3,B00DZP1C8G,"This 3-disc DVD holiday release will just contain 3 DVD releases (featuring Tom & Jerry, Scooby Doo, and the Looney Tunes) that were released a long time ago. But it's not that bad of a release, but not worth it if you already have the original DVD releases. I mostly recommend this for families and children who want to buy this for the holidays.
