7307266,5,B010CG2EBY,"This film is Definitely of a different breed of comedy than your typical comedy film. The jokes are solidly written and the performances by the cast members of the film are perfect for the circumstances. I personally found it more than a little bit out of the normal way of things, in how the musical sequences were spliced into the film, and I have not a single regret. Now, granted, I didn't sit down and watch it start to finish (being that I lowered the volume on the music scenes, and cranked it back up for the speaking scenes, it was a bit of a chore), I really enjoyed it in half an hour bursts, in the span of five hours or so.

You have a certain period of time, around five or so minutes, of typical dialog of the characters in the film, and then on comes this rather loud rock/metal music comes into being the only sounds in focus for a bit, and then it goes back to the next speaking scene. If you come at this film with expectations, or judgments as to what comedy should be, you have to be warned that you will be disappointed. If you would like to see a film that will Definitely have you laughing, look no further. While there is quite a bit of nudity, sexual situations and explicit humor, it never goes into triple X rated level.

With that being said, there is no way that I would be willing to watch this video with anyone under the age of adulthood. What I did that made me buy this film, was checking it out on YouTube, and even though the humor was abnormal, found laughter, so I bought this film.",1458000000,22,1521,4.223367697594502

7307271,5,B010CG2EBY,"You'll laugh!  You'll cry!  Because the brain damage of watching this movie has caused your emotions to become random and confused.

Really though, any movie that leaves me this confused has to be good.  It just has to be.  Ok, ""good"" isn't the right word.  Not the right word at all.  Still, five stars for shocking and surprising me.

Don't watch this.  You'll never get that part of your life back.",1450656000,15,401,4.535211267605634

7307273,5,B010CG2EBY,"This was a fun romp in a bizarre alternate reality.  It's one of those movies that get better on every re-watch because this one is dense with information.  I haven't seen Dangrrr Doll in any previous movies.  I hope that she will become a regular cast member, like Erin Brown or Lydia Lael.",1448064000,2,291,4.452830188679245
7307274,5,B010CG2EBY,"Bill Zebub continues his conversation on topics innumerable, with lots of female nudity and silly jokes.  That's what this movie comprises.  If you've seen his movies before, you know what to expect.  He's definitely refining his craft over time, but it's still obviously ""independent film"" levels of professionalism.

If you haven't seen Bill Zebub...he is an independent film maker who hires a cast largely consisting of himself and several attractive women willing to be nude in his movies.  The plot and action of his movies may be odd, but it's also peppered with silly jokes, physical humor, and extended dialogue about social and political ills of the time.  His movies are entertaining, somewhat titillating, and often thought-provoking, with a heavy metal soundtrack.  YouTube is suffused with snippets of his movies (or even whole copies, released by Bill to entice viewers to buy his DVDs).",1446163200,19,901,5.215277777777778

7307289,1,B010CG2EBY,"WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!  I didn't expect much to begin with since it came from the limited grey matter of Bill Zebub.  However, it said it starred Erin Brown (aka Misty Mundae).  Usually, my favorite furry lez can at least make a movie watchable, but not this time.  It doesn't even deserve one star, but you have to give it at least one if you want to write a review.",1471737600,5,367,4.2

7307292,3,B010CG2EBY,"The film has a bunch of would-be porn stars get naked and then raped by puppets. There is a lot of heavy conversations about religion, pedophilia, homosexuality, grammar, Sesame Street, and Mr. Rogers. There are clearly sacrilegious scenes that most Christians would find distasteful.

The movie includes full frontal close up nudity, except for Erin Brown aka Misty Mundae who just goes in bra and panties. At times they had problems reading their lines with a straight face...and didn't. The plot was a mess. What was with the dog running in the snow?",1464652800,5,553,4.946236559139785

8721912,1,B010CG2EBY,"I thought maybe this one in particular would be goofy enough to offset the brand of puke taste that the producer/director will never get tired of. Not enough misty,  too much bill. I've heard of his work before and only Misty not appearing anywhere else lately was enough for me to buy this. Enough of my opinions, let's move onto an objective review of this film.

It sucks.",1521331200,,375,4.5

8721914,1,B010CG2EBY,"Whatever your expecations are, prepare for disappointment. I'll preface this with, I like low budget horror films....this is just garbage. The women are disgusting, you can get Hep C just watching this. I don't know who the long haired guy is, but you'll get motion sickness watching him sway back and forth as he awkwardly delivers his terrible dialogue (I assume writer/director). The plot is almost nonexistant, and they used the muppets, which I'm sure jim Henson's studio might have issue with. In fact, this is so bad, I might just tell them.

Do not buy this film, you are enabling whoever made this.",1503273600,,607,4.836538461538462
8721915,1,B010CG2EBY,"I have never seen a film as bad as this. Aside from pretty naked girls, this film is an insult to the world. I wish I never bought it. Heed this warning if you consider buying it. I may never pass this way again.",1500508800,,212,3.840909090909091
8721916,2,B010CG2EBY,"Just...wow.  I thought this would be a fun blue movie, I'm so glad I watched it before bad movie night and didn't inflict it on my friends.  There are ""sex scenes"" which are puppets on top of unwilling women over thrash metal that somehow makes it so much worse.  In between these are what I can only describe as hardcore alt-right propaganda scenes, i.e. 5-10 minutes of the director explaining to a lesbian that she has a mental illness and is pretty much the same as a pedophile.

Save your money.  If you already bought it, take the loss and just throw it out before you waste your time too.",1496707200,3,595,4.372727272727273
