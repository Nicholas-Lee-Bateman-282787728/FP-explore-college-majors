7956322,1,B00005Y4RI,"Silly propaganda thinly disguised as science to fool non-scientists. It gives a bad name to religion. It's in the same class with climate change deniers, vaccine conspiracy theorists, It would be funny if people who believe in this stuff didn't vote.",1455235200,,250,5.121951219512195
7956323,1,B00005Y4RI,"Is this a joke?  Unfortunately not.  Mr. Liebert has a BS in Chemistry and an MBA in ""Marketing.""  OOOOoooooo!(from where I wonder.)  But apparently hat gives him enough background to professionally scam the ignorant and hoodwink the unsuspecting, but not much more.  With credentials like that, I'm sure this guy knows far, far better than Smith, Hutton and over 200 years of scientific research and discovery in the field of geology.  In reality, me thinks Mr. Liebert is desperately trying to work through the disconnects he's discovered between scientific REALITY and his musty, old book of Bronze/Iron age mythology.",1323561600,2,621,5.222222222222222
