7822541,5,6302183618,"I can't BELIEVE that this utterly fantastic sci-fi/romance/supernatural/crime movie is not available on DVD!  If any of the ""powers that be"" read this review, PLEASE release this film on DVD.  Since Amazon.com has neglected to provide a summary, I'll quote from the box of the 1991 Academy Entertainment VHS release: FRONT COVER: ""Sean Craig was dead for six minutes....Long enough to fall in love.""  BACK COVER: ""Martin Kove of RAMBO and THE KARATE KID is a detective who crosses the boundary between life and death--and emerges to find himself caught up in a supernatural mystery beyond his wildest dreams.  Fatally wounded by vengeful drug runners, police detective Sean Craig dies and experiences an extra-ordinary vision of a beautiful woman--a woman who desperately needs his help.  Reviving from his after-life interlude, Craig begins an obsessive, perilous quest to find--and save--his mystery girl.  But to do that he'll have to die...again.  In the vein of such supernatural hits as GHOST and FLATLINERS, it's an electrifying tale of underworld treachery, explosive violence and unearthly romance.""  This is a GREAT movie!  Don't hesitate to purchase it!",1240531200,5,1164,5.351648351648351
