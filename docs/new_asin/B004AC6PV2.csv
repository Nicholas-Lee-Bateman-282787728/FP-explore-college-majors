4307104,5,B004AC6PV2,"Lionsgate deserves plaudits for their excellent four film collection series on DVD. I usually buy only blu rays now, but at this great price this was too good an offer to pass up. Even with international shipping, it was highly affordable.

I was surprised to find that the four films came in four separate discs, instead of two-fers or flippers. Disc art is minimal though. Lionsgate has not skimped on the extras either, with a decent amount of valuable supplemental material. One of the films had four commentaries, in fact. Again, I did not expect any extras or even SDH subtitles at this low price for all four films. Lionsgate has somehow managed to fit in all four discs in one standard DVD case, so do not worry about shelf space.

As for the movies themselves, the price of admission is worth for Cabin Fever and Descent alone, both excellent movies. The fact that their not-so-well-known sequels are included is a real bonus. Again, don't expect the sequels to live up to the originals, but they are nevertheless a good way to spend 90 minutes or so. The picture and audio quality of all four films are very good, especially if upsampled on a blu ray or an upconverting DVD player.

If you are a true horror/thriller fan and do not have any of the films featured in this collection, you should add this to your cart post-haste. This box set is highly recommended for all movie fans out there. I can hardly wait to sample the other four film collections issued by Lionsgate, which really has an excellent slate of horror movies. Note that some of the films are available on BD and DVD individually for perfectionists, but this is a real bargain that you will not want to miss.",1296691200,20,1685,4.591362126245847

4307138,4,B004AC6PV2,"I'm always a big fan of the film collections like this. All 4 films in this particular collection are definitely worth a watch, though ""The Descent"" films are much better than the ""Cabin Fever"" ones. The original ""Cabin Fever"" was much much better than the sequel, which just tried to capitalize on the success of the first. Both involve a connecting story line where a rampant, flesh eating bacteria has everyone suspicious of everyone else and running scared. ""The Descent"" films were my favorite of the collection. Both films with a connecting story line involving lost and panicked cave divers fighting to survive against a primal enemy who wants them for dinner.",1463356800,,667,4.964285714285714

- Cabin Fever 2 - 3 (This one is kinda.... blah. I'd relate it more to an old school horror movie than something new age)

I would definitely give the Descent movies a HUGE recommendation for any horror fan. (Especially if you're looking for a movie that is able to deliver the thrill and gore of a horror movie without relying on sex to sell. Since there is literally NO sexual situations in the entire movie - though there might be a light shower scene, though I can't rememeber 100%.)",1395619200,4,479,4.382022471910112

4307211,5,B004AC6PV2,"I wouldn't necessarily put Cabin Fever in the same quality bracket as The Descent, but I'm all about any thriller movie, ridiculously bad, or pretty good. And you have both in this packet. Although, Cabin Fever one isn't terrible. It's your typically young folks in the woods getting slayed or dying grotesquely type film. It's the second Cabin Fever that's the gamechanger.... and not in a increasing quality way. Cabin Fever was a B+ exaggerated typical teen thriller... but Cabin Fever 2 went downhill to like... a C... It had fantastic moments of sheer DISGUSTINGness that I will admit were completely unique to horror movies, good and bad.... but everything else was a mishmosh of your typically low budget funnier than scary movie (I like those, though...). The Descent is one of my favorite thrillers in the past 15 years definitely. Both the first and the sequel are pretty darn good. It's a bit refreshing from your typical plague/home invasion/slasher films and has AMAZING ass kicking scenes, both. This quad is SOOO worth the money. I would have easily paid the price for just the Descent of a Descent 1 and 2 duo... but I was very pleased to pay 4 for the price of one refurbished movie (even though these are actually new).",1389312000,6,1237,4.785046728971962
4307212,5,B004AC6PV2,"It's hard to beat The Descent for sheer ""Holy s***"" moments. It's a great flick, & the sequel was pretty good too. Cabin Fever is more silliness, particularly by the time they get to the second movie. Still, the Cabin Fever movies are fun to watch with friends on a Saturday over some beers & popcorn (if you like that sort of thing).

To recap:
1. The Descent (Awesome very scary movie).
2. The Descent 2 (Good movie in its own right, but not nearly as scary as the first one).
3. Cabin Fever (Weird, but enjoyable, backwoods flesh eating zombie disease horror comedy).
4. Cabin Fever 2 (See above, but this time the disease that turns you into a flesh eater is loose at a high school dance).",1388275200,5,693,4.372093023255814

I enjoyed this 4-pack because I would have paid that $8 (including shipping to Alaska) for the The Descent and/or Cabin Fever alone, but this panned out to $2/movie!  Although The Descent 2 didn't get great reviews, I just viewed it as a free extra.  After watching The Descent, though, I was desperate to see more and feel more closure, and even though The Descent 2 wasn't nearly as great, I enjoyed the opportunity to get more out of the film and watch a good, well-made horror film as well.  The only film I haven't watched is Cabin Fever 2 simply because I saw the trailer during the Cabin Fever credits and am definitely going to wait for a horribly boring rainy day to pop that in.",1371168000,4,847,4.445161290322581

4307221,5,B004AC6PV2,"For the price, this collection of four horror films is a solid value.  The movies are the same editions that are available individually, and the four DVD's are housed in one space saving, standard size case.  The movies included are Cabin Fever (2002), Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (2009), The Descent (2005), and the Descent 2 (2009).

Co-written and directed by Eli Roth (the Hostel films), this sick tale follows the misfortunes of group of friends, who encounter a flesh eating disease while vacationing at a cabin in the woods.  Isolated and facing a crisis, the group spirals down a deadly and destructive path.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cabin-Fever-2-Spring-Fever/dp/B002YI9304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever</a>&nbsp;(Rating: 3 stars)
In the sequel directed by Ti West (who now seems to have disowned the film), the source of the infection has made its way into bottled water being sold in the area.  When the tainted water is used in the punch being served at the local high school, the prom becomes a bloodbath, and an event that some are determined to cover up.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>&nbsp;(Rating: 4.5 stars)
The Descent follows a group of women who encounter some vicious creatures, while exploring in some subterranean caves.  Director Neil Marshall's claustrophobic and terrifying thriller became both a critical and financial success.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent-Part-2/dp/B0037E8HNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent: Part 2</a>&nbsp;(Rating 3 starts)
The sequel features a return to the subterranean world, although this time conditions are not quite as dark and tightly constricted, the creatures still have a taste for human flesh.  Neil Marshall does not direct, but serves as executive producer.

The Descent is regarded as something of a minor classic in the creature genre, and the Cabin Fever films also have a fanbase.  Those interested in any particular movie should check out the individual reviews for more detail.  The main point about this collection is that for a modest price, you can own all four films, on individual DVD's.  Even if you already have one or two of the movies, it's such a good buy that you could still come out ahead.",1341014400,,2575,6.237288135593221
4307222,5,B004AC6PV2,"Cabin Fever 1 could have stood alone as a great horror movie but they made a second one. Diffrent from the first in the tone and all around flow. Part 2 does not take place in a cabin (so what). Best part, as in scean that sticks with you is the ooooozy wee wee.....yeah, life like wang dropping puss out. Don't wuss out just watch it. It'll put hair or hives or some thing on your chest. Descent 1 and 2 go together very nicely. try watching them back to back to make one big bloody, slimey, gorey scream fest. It's hot chicks fighting monsters and doing a great job at it.  Side note: don't like your mother in law catch you watching any of these. It's hard to explain what's going on when people are pukeing blood (I belive that's in all four films)",1314748800,6,752,4.186206896551724
