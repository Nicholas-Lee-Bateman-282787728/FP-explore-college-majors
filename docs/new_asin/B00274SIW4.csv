3858185,5,B00274SIW4,"I love to dance and I love to dance with my favorite dancers from SYTYCD. This DVD is great; the hip hop with Lauren REALLY gets your heart pumping; Travis's lyrical is awesome - I had never really done anything like it, and I found, through him, I LOVE lyrical style dancing. Courtney's Disco routine is a whole lot of fun too; great way to end my workout by just getting down into the groove. If you like SYTYCD you'll love this video.",1251072000,,437,4.27710843373494
3858186,5,B00274SIW4,"I have to say, I was thrilled to hear that SYTYCD was coming out with workout DVD's. I have tried other dance work out DVD's and they always end up being really lame; and the choreography is really more like aerobics class rather than dance. This has true choreography in it, and it is FUN!!! I hadn't really found anything that was difficult enough for me in skill level, as well as in the workout, until this one. This DVD challenged me both physically and mentally, and I was exhausted by the time it was over. I have over 10 years of dance experience, and I was surprised how it challenged me still. I recommend this for anyone that doesn't belong to a gym, that loves to dance, and wants to actually get a workout in at home! This is one that you WANT to do over and over again!",1249862400,2,783,4.226666666666667
3858187,5,B00274SIW4,"The two So You Think You Can Dance Get Fit DVD's are the best thing to come out since my favorite summer TV show started five seasons ago!  This one, Cardio Funk, is such a wonderful change from the same old regular contrived ""hip hop"" moves in 10-minute segments, or proliferation of oldies music dance tapes.  YUCK!  I would rate this DVD as intermediate with some impact.  If you are not already fit and haven't done dance workouts before, you will be overwhelmed by the choreography; start out with Petra Kolber.  I consider it an interval workout, considering the slowness of the beginning choreography of each dance segment.  However, each dance builds in tempo until it is being done at full speed and full impact.  Even the 10-minute or so warm up starts very easy and builds up to a cardio tempo.  However, I didn't feel I would have gotten a full workout unless I did the entire tape, which was about 140 minutes long.  I must say, the time absolutely flew by.

Some things you don't get on an ordinary dance exercise tape:  the contagious energy and enthusiasm from the SOTYCD crew.  Also, really creative choreography.  And don't think these guys don't know their physiology as well as say, Kathy Smith.  They have been training for years, and throughout the DVD they point out how to do moves correctly to avoid muscle strain.

Throughout the teaching of each set of choreography (hip-hop with Lauren, disco with Courtney and contemporary with Travis), the moves initially seem confusing when they are taught one-on-one with the dancer.  But they are done again and again, slowly adding more dancers and slightly increasing tempo, then adding the music, and by the end when they are doing it full tempo with music, I totally had it down.  I've also been doing home workout videos for 25 years, mainly dance and kickbox, so again, not for total beginners.  At the conclusion, there is a bonus workout, shorter than the other dances, kind of just for kicks, that uses moves from all three workouts.

This workout is a total blast!  Not my hardest workout; I have 45 minute kickbox DVD's that leave me more winded.  But none are more fun, and if you do the whole thing, you've done a good, core-emphasizing workout.  My only complaint is that the choreography of the warm-up of this one is identical to that of the Tone and Groove DVD, and I think universally everyone is going to buy both.  With all their creative choreography, they could have come up with different warm-ups.  But the rest is so great, I forgive them!",1249344000,34,2531,4.687074829931973
3858188,5,B00274SIW4,Wow - what an awesome DVD - this workout is incredible and the way they teach and breakdown the routines is so cool.  It was really fun.  A true dance fitness workout.  Travis's routine is so dynamic it was just awesome.  Buying the other one now.  I highly recommend this!!,1248825600,2,274,4.4
3858189,5,B00274SIW4,Great Video!  I love these dancers!  The time just flew by and before I knew it I was having a blast and sweating my butt off!,1248739200,,126,3.8076923076923075
3858190,5,B00274SIW4,"I just received the So You Think You Can Dance Get Fit Cardio Funk and Tone & Groove dvds yesterday (I tried CF yesterday and T&G today), so my reviews will be based on my first impressions, and then I'll edit them again later regarding the long term results.

First thought-I LOVE these dvds! Because the routines were explained well and taught in a progression, I was able to pick up the choreography for each dance the first time through, though I felt all of the routines were definitely challenging and VERY effective as workouts! After just finishing the second dvd today; my muscles are sore, I'm sweating, and I feel fantastic (and like I worked really hard)! The dancers were all very energetic, encouraging, and none of them ever missed a beat/step on the routines. It was exciting to see all of these great personalities from the show (definitely 5 of my many favorites) choreographing, dancing, and having such a blast out there-and it's even more fun to dance along with them!

Getting down to business, the menu screen has a 'Play All' option which takes you through the warm-up, all 3 routines (with instructions), and the cool down. In the 'Workouts' section, you can choose between the 3 routines (with or without instructions) and the bonus workout that combines the three styles with some extra steps (also with our without instructions). The Warm-Up and Cool Down sections are taught by the whole group of dancers, switching off. They're the same combination of dance-infused stretches on both dvds and they've got a funky flavor going on the Warm-Up and more of a bluesy tone on the Cool Down. I found them to be fully effective in preparing me for the workouts and cooling me down afterward, as well as enjoyable ways to begin and end the session. For extra entertainment value, the dvd also includes interviews with the three dancers featured on the front cover, as well as with Nigel Lithgoe. The dancers' interviews include behind the scenes clips from their workout rehearsals, taping, and photo shoot, as well as them just goofing off with each other and having fun. I expect that all fans of the show would really enjoy these parts as much as I did. :) Anyway, I chose to 'Play All' and then perform the Bonus dance with instruction and my total workout time for each day was about 1 hour and 40 minutes! That will be reduced without the instructions, though I think it's always good to get the extra benefit of performing the moves slowly and isolating the muscles whenever there's time. Seriously, for only $11?-What a tremendous value for the money!

On this dvd:
-Lauren-Hip Hop: This had a very nice groove to it and you can tell that she really focused on making sure that we got a tremendous cardio workout in her routine (especially at full speed). It's fast, it hits, and it's very fun!
-Travis-Contemporary: I loved this one! Beautiful, flowing movements and stops that if done correctly will give your back, arms, waistline, calves, and abs a great stretch and workout!
-Courtney-Disco: This was so cute! Fairly simple moves strung together into a FAST and extremely fun little number. I found this to be an especially effective on my legs. There's lots of comedy in this one too, ""check you out, check you out!"" :)

The video clip at the top of the screen will give you a nice preview into how the steps are taught and the types of moves you'll be doing. I'm so excited to have added this fitness dvd into my collection and hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did! ***** Difficulty: Intermediate/Challenging (At least a little dance training recommended, if not required).",1248566400,56,3610,4.716323296354992
3858191,1,B00274SIW4,"This is one of the worst exercise dvd's on the market.  The dvd is set up so that you must skip through the instructional portions of each routine before you get to the ""workout"".  Each routine is divided into 3 speeds; slow, medium and fast.  Each section is not repeated enough and the cast members spend too much time talking between the sections to really get a good calorie burn.  Skip this one.",1248393600,12,400,4.438356164383562
3858192,5,B00274SIW4,"Especially while the show is airing, who doesn't want to feel like they can be part of So you think you can dance!  Totally fun to dance with a bunch of dancers from past seasons, and get a great workout at the same time.

Three different styles of dance routines (hip hop, contemporary, and disco), you can pick one or do all three, and there are separate chapters for the instructions to learn the routines that you can skip and go straight to the workouts after you get them down.  Learning the steps is nice and slow, and easy to follow or repeat if you get lost.  Then in the workouts they start with doing the routine counting, and get faster, add music, until it's more like a performance at the end - just music no counting at full speed.  There is also a bonus dance that mixes the styles together.  The dancers on the video are Travis, Katee, Dmitry, Twitch, Lauren, and Courtney.

My only slight complaint is the music is a bit generic, so you aren't going to feel like you are telling any kind of story in the routine like from the show, but after all it is an exercise dvd, so this isn't that big of a deal.  It would be cool if they came out with a couple that were focused more on just dance so you feel more like a real routine though.  But for now I'm pretty happy they did this at all, and I'm looking forward to trying the other one, Tone and Groove!",1248307200,62,1369,4.194656488549619

3858204,3,B00274SIW4,"DVD is great for a quick workout, easy to follow routines, but not was I was thinking for a cardio workout.

3858209,3,B00274SIW4,"I am medium healthy and this workout kept my body warm, but only a little sweat. I was sore the next few days so I built up some muscles.

 I would say get the video if you want short routines to learn. Don't expect great music or to see the SYTYCD set. The music is instrumental in the first two routines. Most of the section is learning the routine and then you practice faster and faster. There are not a lot of steps in each routine, so its not a full songs worth, so they repeat the same routine over and over. The moves were simple to learn. In fact, some were so simple I questioned whether much of it would actually be in the routines we see on the show, except for Travis. (Travis' was the hardest and I didn't really get all his moves the first time through.)Skip the warm-ups and cool downs in this video. It seemed like you could get injured (for example- stretch your back and bend to the ground while swaying your back- back and forth.)However, the routines were safe.

I would say it was okay.  I probably won't do it much, but it was fun enough.",1377907200,2,1061,4.211822660098522
3858210,2,B00274SIW4,"First off I am not a fan of 8 counting. I get thats how dancers do it but I suck at it and am just looking for a fun workout to get my heart rate going.  There was too much standing around watching them count out the moves. If I want to have a routine to show off somewhere this would be great. But, I am looking for a cardio workout while dancing. I did like the moves, they were fresh and the instructors are enthusiastic and from the show which I love.

Honestly I only watched the hip hop routine which was what I was most interested in. I had to replay the same moves over and over. I just wasn't too wild about the format and never finished the rest. Not worth returning, but I'm not sure I will try this one again.",1365724800,,721,3.9655172413793105

3858212,2,B00274SIW4,". . . especially for the hip hop routine.  What is that, easy listening?  I get that the music needs to be generic but it should at least have a beat.  The funk music does not resemble funk in any way, either.  I gave this video two stars because the disco routine does use disco music.  (Pleasant surprise.)  I was hoping these routines would take me back to my clubbing days in Oakland/SF/SJ in the 90's.  Not even close.

If you are hoping to be motivated by music, skip this one.  I have much more fun with Shawn T.'s Rockin' Body Series.",1360540800,2,542,4.235294117647059

I quickly grew impatient with all of the talking... where's the workout?  I did give it a chance and found myself doing my own step moves while all the instruction was going on so at least I was moving.  I will not be watching this DVD again.

3858221,4,B00274SIW4,"This video is so fun! It has a warm up at the beginning, then three segments taught by each of the three instructors you see on the front. There's a hip hop segment first, then contemporary dance, and then disco at the end (my personal favorite). Each segment teaches you all the moves really slow at the beginning (once you get really good at them you can skip these short sections--don't worry, you still get a great workout even if you skip them). Then you do the same moves to count, then a little faster with music, and then you perform them (meaning to music at the same speed but with no verbal instructions). If you want a super-fun, fast-paced dance workout that's exactly what you'll get with this video! I love it and I'm always sweating and breathing hard by the end of each section.",1325980800,,795,4.4520547945205475
3858222,1,B00274SIW4,"I read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing this DVD, so I expected it to be a good, fun workout. I was extremely disappointed.

Most dance workouts are arranged like an aerobics class. The teacher teaches you a move to the music, and then you practice that move while watching the teacher. Then you move onto the next part, you practice it, then put the moves together. This way, you are constantly moving while creating muscle memory.

The creators of this DVD decided it would be better to spend an absurd amount of time having the audience just watch the instructor talk through the dance before actually getting to engage in it. When you do start dancing, it's to the instructor counting out a beat rather than to actual music. After some of that, you finally get to do the dance to music.

This means that over the course of 20 minutes, you learn one short dance routine, and you only dance it to music for 7 minutes. In order to get a workout, you have to just repeat that part over and over again.

I think the whole setup was a really poor choice by the creators of this DVD, and I regret purchasing it.",1323475200,66,1115,4.398058252427185
3858223,5,B00274SIW4,"After some trepidation, looking at those young kids and the shape they are in (I have never watched the show), I tried the video and really liked it.  Like many others have said, they take you nice and slowly building on the routine until you feel you have the hang of it, so I didn't feel like a spaz and actually feel like I am participating.  The kids are cute and likeable, as well as very talented.  I just love Courtney!  If it can get me to consistently put it on in the evenings after work, and give it another try, that's saying something major!  I am not totally out of shape; I do walk a lot, but this is a whole different experience.  Makes me feel just a little younger again!  Definitely worth the money!",1321401600,4,718,4.235294117647059

It does break it down quite a bit for a beginner, and at the end of the dvd there is a special dance jam that is fun too!  I love the show, so of course I loved the dvd.

The steps are taught step by step in a way that is easy to understand. And the routine is not too long, so it is not hard to pick it up. Plus, the routines are done so many times in a row that even if you get lost, it is easy to jump back in at any point and attempt to complete the routine.

3858231,3,B00274SIW4,"I have found Dance is the best way for me to workout and NOT get bored. It fits my body better and I get into shape quicker too. When I found this DVD I was excited, because I have always loved the dancing from the show and thought this DVD would have some great music and dance moves. Also, a couple of my fave dancers from the show where on it.
I watched the DVD and was a bit disappointing on a couple of things- the music sucked. They could have used better music, especially for the Hip Hop section. The music they put to that was very very lame. The other disappointment, the sections for each dance wasn't long enough. I liked that they had different dance styles. I think that was great. It helps people try different styles and find what works for them. For me, the section that worked my body was the Contemporary.  My core muscles were sore the next day. So, I want more of the Contemporary dance workout.
I hope that if they do more of these, they will create a library of dance workouts that focus on one dance style. Hip Hop series, Contemporary/Jazz/Ballet series,...etc. If they do that, I think they would have a real hit here.
I gave this a three star rating because I felt they could have done better with this. They have great talent at their finger tips, they should use it. Oh..if they create a DVD where Mia does the choreo, I will most definitely buy it!!! She is AMAZING!!!!",1290729600,4,1399,4.319391634980988
3858232,4,B00274SIW4,"Overall, I liked this video because the dancers do fun routines, there are a variety of routines, and each dance gets progressively faster.  The setting and wardrobe are bright, and the dancers are energetic and encouraging.  My biggest complaint about the DVD is that there are frequent breaks during each dance and between each routine.  also, the demonstrations are not a separate menu option on the main menu.  So, after you have had the DVD for a while and know the routines, you still have to watch each demonstration or press fast forward.  I would prefer the 'play all' option on the main menu to include only the routines at quick pace with little to no interruption for a better workout.  I prefer Julianne's cardio ballroom DVDs because of this feature.",1285891200,,764,4.793893129770993
3858233,5,B00274SIW4,"I recently got my Mom both So You Think You Can Dance workout DVDs for her birthday and have been using them myself since. Personally, I recommend the Cardio Funk DVD over the Tone and Grove: the routines feel like more of a workout and they're more fun. Lauren's hip hop involves a lot of jumping around so you're really breathing heavily when it's done. Travis's contemporary is my favorite: it's not as fast-paced, so it gives you time to focus on your movements and engage your muscles. My back and arms were sore after performing the contemporary workout. Courtney's disco is just fun and energetic, so you don't mind repeating it a few times.

It's easy to learn the routines at your own pace thanks to the scene skip function on any DVD player. Once they're taught slowly in detail, the routines are done to counts and then to music at three successively faster speeds. I found the routines easy enough that I only had to go through the instructions once to learn them sufficiently. The bonus workout that combines moves from the three routines is done much more quickly and can be a little hard to follow; I haven't mastered that one yet. As others have said, the music is somewhat uninspiring, but the dancers' enthusiasm makes up for it.

I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who's a fan of the show and finds traditional workouts a chore. The familiar faces and fun dance routines are a great way to mix things up!",1281484800,2,1421,4.568627450980392
3858234,3,B00274SIW4,"I would consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness and, overall, I barely broke a sweat doing this.  That said, if you like dancing, it is a fun way to get a bit of exercise while doing something you enjoy.

My major complaint with this is that, for myself, the best way for me to learn any semi-complex routine (more complex than the moves done in any typical exercise DVD that can be copied with barely any thought) is to see the instructor's back and be able to see their front via a mirror (sort of the way a dance class usually has a mirror on one wall.)  I'm sure they could figure out a way to angle the camera to catch the mirror image just right or put a different camera angle in a box on the corner of the screen or something.  I find it unnecessarily difficult because I'm instinctively trying to move the same leg as they are on screen but they are calling out the opposite left/right instruction.",1278806400,2,919,4.294797687861272

3858238,3,B00274SIW4,"I liked but not loved this dvd. I have other dance videos in my collection that I prefer to this one.
The reasons are the following:
The DVD sometimes glitches and it takes longer than my other dvds to work.
The dancers talk too much before they start to dance they make a big speech of what they are going to do and you stand there staring eager to start working out. The girls repeat themselves too much. Travis is great and from the whole dvd his routine is the only one that is more like the show. The routine is beautiful and you really work you legs and side abdominals.
The dancers are slow to start but too quick to follow. They are too much of a dancer all of them. They put a bit too much of they dancer flare and if you are new or intermediate as I am to dancing you will still not be able to do the moves like they do them.

i'm >40 and i'm trying to improve my dance mojo!  i own several dance videos (paula abdul, 10 minute solution, dance off the inches, The Firm, Lisa Wheeler, The Method, crunch...) and have been exercising to videos for >10 years.  dance is an area i've been trying to improve on, and i needed something more fun than Leslie Sansone's walking videos, hence my latest foray into dance workouts.  i still have the Leslie's but just needed to try something with more intensity and challenge.

i've used this video twice and i chose to do the instructional segments both times.  even though they take time, you can still get a good workout with those segments since the movements are very deliberate as you learn the moves.  i used my heart rate monitor and noticed that i can stay in my cardio zone, and even go higher than that in some instances (lauren's segment, for example).

for example, Lauren's hip hop segment has some high impact (side to side ""pony"" jumping).  whether you do it slow or fast, your heart rate will go up.

in Travis' contemporary segment, it kind of reminded me of standing yoga/pilates where you're using your entire body to do the moves.  it flowed well.

Courtney's segment is disco, but not your 70's disco.  the moves are travolta, but the music is contemporary, if you can imagine that.

the disc is chaptered so you can choose just the workouts, and each workout at dance speed, is roughly 6 minutes apiece.  so with the warm-up (11 min) and cool down (5 min?), you've got a roughly 35 min workout.

the great thing about this too is that they mirror cue, even in side profile position.  that means when they refer to ""the right foot"", it's ""your own right foot"", like you're looking in a mirror.

i have never watched the show, so i can't compare whether it's similar.  as a workout video, it's pretty solid.  the warm up is very generous and thorough.  i do the entire workout barefooted, and some of dancers do it in bare feet.",1263772800,4,2170,4.941988950276243
3858243,4,B00274SIW4,I've only used the hiphop dance portion and it was a great workout. I'm excited to try the other types of dance.,1261612800,,112,4.136363636363637
3858244,4,B00274SIW4,"""So You Think You Can Dance: Cardio Funk"" is a workout DVD based on the popular TV show with three of the styles from the show: Hip-Hop, Contemporary, and Disco.  It is led by past contestants who are pretty good teachers and seem to enjoy what they are doing.  I've broken down my review into each workout portion to best explain this DVD.

Warm-Up-The warm-up is rather long, lasting about 13 minutes, but it is really fun each time I do it.  It is led by the three featured instructors as well as the other three from the partner DVD.  It contains the same exercises as the partner DVD which include stretches and some hopping dance moves.  A rather long warm-up, but it is fun.

Hip-Hop-Led by Lauren, the hip-hop routine is full of high cardio hops, knee lifts, and twists.  Lauren instructs really well by being motivating, but not over the top.  Her music choice is not what I'd expect for hip-hop, but it is still nice.

Contemporary-Led by Travis, this routine is the lowest cardio on the DVD, but the best in terms of REAL dancing.  The routine features moves I've never seen before, and Travis does a great job of teaching them.  He is a bit silly sometimes, but he really is a good instructor.  Once again, the music choice was nice but not what I'd expect for contemporary.

Disco-Led by Courtney, this routine is full of shuffles, hitchhikers, and points.  It moves quickly, but the steps are easy to learn and fun.  Courtney is a great instructor, but she sometimes sounds like she's yelling at the TV screen.  She can be quite loud.  The music choice is disco, but it's not a song I recognize.

Bonus-Led by all six instructors, it mixes the basic moves from each routine together.  I was able to get it my first time through, but others could find it a bit more complex.  Fun and great addition.

Cool Down-Once again, this is the same moves as in the other partner video, but they are great and relaxing.  They seem to stretch every muscle, and they really calm your body down.  My one complaint is that the stretches aren't held long enough, but it's no biggie.

Overall, it is a fabulous fitness DVD.  It's so fabulous that as soon as I finished it I had to go order the second one.  It is a tad misleading, however, as it says that it lasts 116 minutes.  About half of that is teaching, and once you get the routines and just do the workouts, the mixture of all six parts will be about an hour.  Great work, So You Think You Can Dance, can't wait to see what you come up with next year!  BTW, you don't have to be a fan of the show to enjoy!",1259798400,8,2562,4.355179704016913
3858245,3,B00274SIW4,"Spend so much time learning the lessons, I'm not really getting a workout.  There is too much stopping and starting.  A dance lesson is good for fun and additional workout but I found this dvd too difficult for a primary workout.",1259539200,3,229,4.560975609756097
3858246,3,B00274SIW4,"In order to get a good workout, you need to be willing to re-do the non-instructional segments which takes some willpower. I think the choreography is pretty simple and anyone could learn it (although maybe not do it as good as the dancers!). I was disappointed in the music selection -- it's pretty boring and for me, having great music is most of the fun of dancing! I wish they had used popular music like they do on the show.",1256860800,15,429,4.375
3858247,5,B00274SIW4,"It's great for anyone who has danced. Even though the movement is simple, you still get a good workout and opportunity to improve your technique while learning fun little combos! It also includes a nice warm up and cool down. There are a lot of options to customize your workout depending on how much time you have or how advanced you are. Each combo is repeated a number of  times which means if you don't get the steps right away, you'll still get a decent workout without having to start the while thing over again. I'd recommend it to dancers and people who are very interested in dance.",1253404800,4,591,4.472222222222222

3858249,4,B00274SIW4,"I've been using this DVD for a few weeks now, and I'm satisfied with it.  It is fast-paced, which I like, though I was hoping it would be more ""dance"" rather than typical exercise workout.  While dance is certainly incorporated, only Courtney's disco really felt like dancing.  Still, it's good for exercise.  Lauren's hip-hop is fun, not too hard, and definitely a good cardio workout.  Travis's contemporary is a bit slower paced than the others, and is much more a workout for your arms and upper body.  Courtney's Disco is my favorite.  It's really fast and really fun.  All of the dances were pretty easy for me to learn, but I do have a little dance background so I don't know how it would be for other people.  (For instance, I couldn't see my mom picking it up that easily).",1252022400,,782,4.5285714285714285
