8556585,5,B00AQQGWPU,"Ron Lemen is a great instructor and one of the best in his field. He takes you from start to finish and you really feel the different planes of the head and face as you watch him draw.

The only downside is he goes quit fast in the beginning like when explaining the rhythm lines. perhaps sped up? It would have been nice if he slowed down and took more time with things. its still a great video. I would be greatly interested in any workshops he holds in the future.

Also most gnomon dvds are flash video files thrown on to a disk. The formats vary but most are not true dvd format. this effects many if not all of gnomon disks and is not specific to this dvd or any of Ron's other dvds. They run fine on a computer and the information is just as good. I did not feel that it took away from the instruction at all.",1373414400,3,816,4.030864197530864
