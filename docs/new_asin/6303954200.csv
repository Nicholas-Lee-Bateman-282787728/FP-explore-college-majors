7856745,5,6303954200,"You Can Normally Tell How Great a B-Horror is by...the creation of a sequel. House is no exception. As a comedy-horror, ""House"" broke ground in the 1980s to set the bar higher for B movies. This was a must see B-horror when it came out. It is still good by today's standards, having stood the test of time.

Good rock-n-roll sound track too. George Wendt as the quirky neighbor is classic, and William Katt, a very B actor, is perhaps in his finest performance (where's the Academy?). The baby sitting scene was one that I enjoyed as he tells the 3 year old, ""How would you like to play with a nice plastic bag?"" It is a must for any B horror movie collection. Notice the shadow of the boom mic in the closet? In fact IMDb lists over 2 dozen such goofs for this movie.

Could make for a good drinking party to list all the goofs and then point them out as the movie progresses.",1290816000,,877,4.245508982035928
7856746,4,6303954200,"This comedy-thriller was so unexpectedly good, I was riveted the entire time to the screen. William Katt is great as Roger Cobb, a writer with definite writer's block. When his Aunt Elizabeth is found dead by suicide, he inherits her house (which he once lived in and lost his son). Now, as Roger begins writing again, he begins having nightmares and seeing terrifying visions which he believes are a sign that his son is still alive. George Wendt is actually very funny as the dozy next-door neighbour. The special effects are very imaginative and actually impressive. Overall, I'd HAVE to give this four stars for it's incredible ingenuity. Wonderful viewing.",1059868800,,661,5.0181818181818185
7856747,4,6303954200,"A novelist (William Katt)moves into a new house,where someone committed suicide. He's working a new novel about his experiences in Vietnam,when the nightmares of his memories come to life. The ghost of one of the guys he was with in Nam comes after him. Pretty good,its been awhile since I've watched the movie,but it's kind of a horror/comedy.",1051228800,,344,4.948275862068965
7856748,5,6303954200,"I originally saw this movie 2-3 years after release with a bunch of friends in college, and marvelled at how this thing entertained.  Frightening, funny, tense, and witty.  Well, many things that seemed like that in college in later, sober (er) years didn't hold up that well.  But recently, I happened to see this again and was delighted at how good I still think it is.  Lots of fun, with a deep and spiritual validity (just kidding about that last part).  See what you think.",972000000,,478,4.576470588235294
7856749,4,6303954200,"This movie will not scare you. This movie MIGHT make you laugh. So why is it entertaining? Mainly because of it's intended self awareness, it's  intended quirkiness, and the INTENDED camp feeling. It reminded me of a  lower leveled ""Scream"" for haunted houses.
PERKS: The setting  the make up effects the humor the  ""nothing-is-what-it-seems-in-this-house"" feel
DRAGS: the acting  The vietnam storyline (to serious to put in this fare) The ending, which  was to over the top and took itself seriously
Watch this if it's on tv.  That's about it.",964396800,,544,5.044943820224719
7856750,5,6303954200,"If you're looking for something truly scary, look elsewhere. Same if you're looking for something visually stunning, laden with brilliant acting, or intelligently funny. The humor and the horror in this flick are  both stupid - but that's the whole point. Here's some math: take a Jason  (Friday the 13th) movie, add a Naked Gun movie, divide the humor by 1.5,  the horror by 2, and the budget by 3, and you've got House. It's hilarious,  unpredictable, bizarre beyond belief, maybe a little bit scary at times,  and weirdest of all in a movie like this, the main character is actually  pretty believable! The film takes any 'rules' for haunted houses and throws  them out the window: an unkillable monster that looks like the main  character's wife for a few minutes comes in from outside, some really weird  looking thing emerges from a closet and tries to grab people, and the  bathroom mirror is a portal to somewhere that both is and isn't a beach in  the Vietnam War. If you have an open mind and can laugh at the bizarre and  unpredictable, I highly recommend this movie.",958867200,2,1078,4.675531914893617
7856751,5,6303954200,"I don't care what any of you think. ""House"" is fantastic! It was a funny and wonderful horror/comedy. It wasn't intended to be deep, or moving, or intelligent in the ways you speak of. And I am not a: a college  student of b: desperate for entertainment and I really enjoyed it. But I  can see where you're coming from when I take in the fact that you need a  sense of humor to enjoy this movie. I thought it was fantastically funny  and enjoyable. The acting was not terrible. This movie wasn't written by  Shakespeare or directed by Stephen Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick after all.  But the director of ""House"" did a fine job. If you do not enjoy  movies that are meant purely for fun, you should not watch this. And if you  are expecting Academy Award worthy performances from a low-budget eighties  horror flick, (though William Katt was wonderful) don't watch this. But, if  you enjoy great horror movies with some strange and low-budget effects and  a darling leading man, watch ""House"". It is a great example of  good work from its genre.",958176000,48,1044,4.553763440860215
7856752,4,6303954200,"Director Steve Miner does good job making this film. This film some good laughs, good make-up  special effects are fine and good actors. My only problem with the film is, the scenes where William Katt Character, remember  about the war, the jungle are really fake, the film needed bigger  budget.
Still is one of the good old days of the eighties.",952041600,,347,4.655737704918033
7856753,4,6303954200,"I must say that I liked this film. Okay it's corny and a bit silly in places, but it is still a good film never the less. Some good music and comedy moments along with some gruesome looking ghouls, I recommend you  give HOUSE a look.",951782400,,233,4.065217391304348
