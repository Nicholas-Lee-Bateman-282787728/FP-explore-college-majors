3555441,5,B001EL6ECW,I Loved this show when I was growing up.  It was on for only for 1 season but it was one of the better British TV imports.  If U are a fan of Either Tony Curtis or Pre-James Bond Roger Moore this is a Must See!!!,1362700800,2,212,3.5869565217391304
3555442,3,B001EL6ECW,"the persuaders is a great show and I was expectin some new aventures of, the special film colecction, but is only a copy of some good episodies from season one and two.",1285113600,5,168,4.28125
3555443,2,B001EL6ECW,"Other reviewers are correct that this product is flawed. All three disks are suppose to be in color -- the studio's own website says that they are -- and yet disk two and three are in black and white. On a more positive note, the color on the one disk that was properly transfered is much richer and deeper than the color on the episode versions contained in the box sets. Shame that the other two were screwed up since they did such a fine job on the first.",1231286400,21,458,4.157303370786517
3555444,1,B001EL6ECW,"well i was disappointed of the dvd i thought it was 3 movies that i haven't seen before, but all it is 6 episodes put together to make three move lengths on 3 discs.one disc is in colour and the others were in black & white which on the cover says colour.its not worth it if you got all the tv episodes on dvd. really not good enough the  show was in colour, they are not movies, just episodes put together, 2 to make one movie length.....not worth it.besides all of this its still a great tv show.",1229126400,48,498,4.081632653061225
3555445,2,B001EL6ECW,"I just received the Persuaders triple movie set and there is a defect. The first movie is in color but the next two are black and white. The packaging says, and the screen shots are, in color.
The opening and menus are in color but the scene selection shots are b/w like the movie. This rules out my dvd reading the disc wrong. What a weird defect. I hope Lionsgate offers colored discs for the second and third movie.",1229040000,17,418,4.30379746835443

8298612,1,B001EL6ECW,"As all the reviews have said, these are not actual movies just episodes put together to make it movie length.  And that is just one of the disappointing aspects of this so called ""3 movie set"", the other is ""movies"" from disk 2 and 3 is in black and white.  I already owned the entire collection, so imagine how silly I now feel thinking I was adding something new to the collection only to end up with something I already own.  Not exactly blaming the seller completely because the sheer amount of 1 star reviews should have encouraged me to read them prior to making the purchase, but as 1 star reviews are given for just about anything, I dismissed them as people just being fussy.  The 1 star is really because it feels like a bait and switch.  Otherwise if you don't own the collection or have not seen the series, this might be a great start.  Really do hope it's not too late to return it.",1430006400,2,896,4.303571428571429

8298614,5,B001EL6ECW,Tony Curtis  and Roger Moore have great chemistry - these 3 selections were very entertaining.  Looking forward to purchasing more Persuaders.,1391731200,,142,5.714285714285714
8298615,3,B001EL6ECW,"The Persuaders Film Collection are actual episodes from the TV Series that are compiled together as one for each disc. To note: the episodes are in color and black/white. Disc 1 is in color, while Disc 2 and 3 are in black and white. I know it's a disappointment, but despite the situation here, if you are interested in getting 6 episodes out of the entire series this would be the place to go. So I would recommend getting this film collection even though it's in color and black/white to anyone who is looking for a smaller set over the entire set. A great show with Roger Moore and Tony Curtis from the BBC. The show ran for one season from 1971-1972 in color. Sorry about the latter part of this film collection being in black and white. That's why I rated it as OK. Thank you.",1372032000,,782,4.326530612244898
