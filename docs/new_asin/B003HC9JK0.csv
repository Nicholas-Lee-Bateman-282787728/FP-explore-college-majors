8396988,4,B003HC9JK0,"The only reason I purchased this product was for the historical content of the TTLiang footage which was selfishly deleted from Youtube. The rest is a unconvincing attempt at cinematography. Apparently, TTLiang was convinced to record footage for posterity, which he did. But, to combine his art with this crap is unfathomable. None the less, I would still encourage Tai Chi practitioners to purchase this product for the TTLiang historic content. Despite the ill conceived attempt to promote the directors mistakes, the Tai Chi footage is priceless! Too bad Demian was compelled to waste disk space with his science project, probably didn't have enough Tai Chi footage or failed to grasp the gifts he received.",1362096000,,711,5.191304347826087
8396989,5,B003HC9JK0,"I wish to thank  reviewer ""tcsail"" for encouraging others to purchase my DVD documentary of Master T.T. Liang.

The Master Liang movie demonstrates the basic T'ai Chi forms that he taught. There also is an interview in which he describes T'ai Chi. This is followed by a demonstration of him (in his 70s) tossing me (in my 20s) backward while I was pushing against him.

The original media was black-and-white, 16mm reversal film, with the audio recorded directly on a magnetic track. Because it was recorded on amateur equipment in 1971, the sound and image are not up to today's standards.

The full movie about Master Liang has never been released by me on YouTube, or anywhere else.

In the past, my movie documentary had been illegally released on YouTube and on individual Web sites. They were removed because those who posted them had broken copyright law by publishing my work without permission.

A free excerpt from this movie, may be seen on Vimeo, my Sweet Corn Productions video gallery, and on YouTube:

Also, a free PDF chart of Master Liang's names for each posture of his solo T'ai Chi exercise is located here:

The second movie on the disc has nothing to do with the T'ai Chi movie. It is a silly, dark-ish comedy about a matchmaking hostess at a house party.
It is on the same disc because it would cost the same, no matter if there were one or two short movies, so thought it more of a bargain to have a second short and it would show off my movie making skills. Or not.

I can, however, guarantee that this disc contains no science experiments, and that no animals (human or otherwise) were harmed in the making of these movies.
