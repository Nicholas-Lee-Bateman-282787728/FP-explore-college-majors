The title and opening scenes show life in a 1912 French foundry where the viewer is treated to showering sparks and gurgling torrents of blazing hot molten metal. This is a metaphor for what is to come: emotional turmoil between top employee Horty (Olivier Martinez) and his wife Zoe (Romane Bohringer), in which it seems all those outside the marriage conspire to set the two young lovers against each other.

Horty, spurred on by Zoe, triumphs over his work-mates in a competition and wins the prize of a trip to London to see the Titanic being launched.

Horty's night in a plush London hotel is shown in such a way as to suggest that his meeting with chambermaid Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) is taking place in Horty's head alone. Luna gives the scenes a heightened, dreamlike quality and makes the meeting so improbable as to cause the viewer to question its reality.

When Horty returns from his trip, his workmates suggest that Zoe has been unfaithful. He gets drunk and each night in the bar tells elaborate fantasies about his encounter in London, using a photograph of Marie as inspiration. Successive retellings are accompanied by scenes of Marie and Horty together in increasingly sensual, intimate and fanciful encounters. This reinforces the impression that the original encounter may also have taken place only in Horty's imagination.

The situation unleashes Horty's apparently natural story-telling ability, and he appears to be falling in love with the girl of his imagination in reaction to Zoe's perceived infidelity.

When the Titanic is discovered to have been sunk, Horty is unable to resolve the conflict between his feelings for his wife and his imagination. He fails to cope with his day-to-day existence.

Meanwhile, Horty's reputation has spread and he is offered an opportunity. He accepts and takes Zoe on the road with him. At the same time, Luna uses the journey to both symbolise and literally describe the interplay of emotions between Horty and Zoe.

In the final scenes, Luna takes us again to a place where he can play with his audience's perception of what is fantasy and what is reality. It includes a penultimate scene of shocking brutality, where Horty confronts his tormenting demons.

Eventually, Luna lets us off the hook, allowing us to see what is real and what is not, in a final twist of fate for all those concerned.
The costumes and locations are beautifully lit and used to extremely good effect. Of course the leads are all too stunning to be true which adds further to Luna's creation of illusion.

To sum up: an enticing film full of sensual tension and imagination. There are two small inconsistencies in the narrative but these hardly matter as Luna's purpose is to show how a director can blur the lines between fantasy and reality in a way which tells us something about the dynamics of human relationships, and is at the same time enjoyable and entertaining.
