1903476,5,B0000A59Z0,"I can't find words enough to praise this album. This disc should become the standard against which all Blues DVDs ought to stand up to, it's almost perfect.

John Lord needs no introduction, after all he is why you're reading this. But the band and the amazing blend between them make this disc stand out way over your average blues recording.

Don't expect much in term of visual production, this is a live shot taken in 2003 at a Sidney blues joint called ""The Basement"".  But the recording is flawless and the music, oh, the music. Don't worry about the sound, it's as good as you'll ever get.  The DVD is about over 120 minutes of the best classic Blues you can find anywhere.  Plus you'll be blown to pieces with electric blues band arrangements for tunes the likes of  Cream's  'Strange Brew', Foghat  'I just Want to Make Love to You' and a personal John Lord version of Booker T. & the MG's  'Green Onions' (!!!)

This DVD has 'MUST HAVE - MUST HAVE ' writen all over it.  Don't miss it for the world.",1095206400,6,1009,4.370967741935484
1903477,5,B0000A59Z0,"This DVD/CD is amazing. Jon Lord has always been one of the best rock keyboards players in my opinion. Up there with Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, Ken Hensley, Tony Banks and many more to name. I've seen him with the great Deep Purple many times, in concerts and/or DVDs but these performance is his best ever on keyboards. Playing the blues, a music style dominated by guitars, the way is meant to be. On top of that, he is back with a first class hard rock blues band. Compared to blues bands or musicians like Tinsley Ellis, Walter Trout, John Mayall and many more, this Hoochie Coochie Men is up there with these bands. This DVD blow me away. Within the 12 great songs played here is very important to mention ""You Need Love"" (Led Zeppelin Whole Lotta Love) and the Deep Purple song ""When A Blindman Cry"" from which even Ian Gillan will be proud and and he will cry when he listens to the way this song is played and sung. There are not enough words to say how good this DVD is. Thanks Lord! and the Hoochie Coochie Men",1094947200,8,1022,4.328125
1903478,5,B0000A59Z0,"Folks all I can say is if you don't have this DVD, and you're an admirer of electric blues, as well as a fan of Jon Lord, you're doing yourself a gross injustice.  BUY THIS DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  Jon Lord is such a humble human being, and seems to be so grateful with the life he's lived.  And oh by the way he plays a wicked Hammond B3.  And the Hoochie Coochie Men are pure traditionalists.  BUY THIS DVD.  Enough said.",1088899200,3,432,4.132530120481928

7996081,4,B0000A59Z0,"This is a much older Leo Sayer than the young man who released 'Silverbird' and 'Just A Boy', obviously, but I quite enjoyed watching this concert from a rather small club in Australia. He still puts on one hell of show, and it was quite nice to see him still loving what he does after all these years! I would have given it 5 stars, but I save that fifth star for things I REALLY LOVE!",1413072000,,386,4.092105263157895
7996082,2,B0000A59Z0,"Leo Sayer has a wonderful voice but his act is spoilt by trying to be a comedian and putting on cheap childish voices. Makes it hard to take him seriously as being a class act. DVD is shot at a cheap club, small audience - Not great",1392595200,,232,3.9574468085106385
7996083,2,B0000A59Z0,this is a performer with great talent at the bottom of his career.  its makes me feel sorry for him to have to perform in such a place with those types of people there.  drunken bar trash and he is looking like a down and out has been.  a poor nightclub act that is not helped by the poor quality of the video and audio.  only buy this dvd if you want to feel ripped off.,1298332800,,371,3.8421052631578947

Agree 100% if the other reviews.
