1073974,4,6305772592,"Although the movie's reviews promised magic and mysticism, it in no way, shape, or form relates to dark arts or supernatural power.  It is a good lesson in how the teenage search for acceptance and belonging can go wrong  easily.  Bairstow's character was perfectly matched for his acting style  and Eric Mabius opened my eyes to just how versitile a role he can portray.  If anything, you can gain respect for the Youth of America as we continue  to struggle to keep our heads above the Ocean of Humanity.  Donnie  Wahlberg's cameo was a longshot from his New Kid on the Block days, but  incedibly refreshing!",936835200,,610,4.679245283018868
1073975,3,6305772592,"Black Circle Boys is an interesting look at how peer pressure can affect decision making and actions.  Eric Mabius was haunting and disturbing as the cult ""leader"".  The film is a very accurate portrayal of how  wanting to ""fit in"" can lead to destructive, and ultimately  deadly behaviors.  The portrayals of the occult ceremonies were very well  done. Low-key, private.  A much more accurate portrayal than the typical  ""Hollywood"" versions.  If you're looking for a statement about  teen cult behavior, peer pressure, and just how dark life can be to a teen,  look no further than Black Circle Boys.  If you are seeking graphic horror  and fast paced action, go back to Hollywood cheese. Be sure to watch the  ""club scene"".  An awesome up and coming band is featured.

1074344,4,6305772592,"I saw this movie on late-night Showtime probably 5 or 6 years ago, and I remembered really digging it. It is ""based on a true story"", that being the one of Ricky Kasso in a 1984 New York suburb. But it's a very sensationalized version of the story.

The real Ricky was a drugged-out dumbass, who killed another dumbass for ripping him off, pretty simple. He listened to Ozzy and Maiden and had a few LaVey books and thought he was a Satanist. He tried to get all the people he knew into it, but they were only there for the drugs. Before he killed the dude he kept telling him to ""Say you love Satan!"" as he was stabbing him, like 21 times, then gouging his eyes out and smashing his head in. There were two other guys in the woods with him; one was his right-hand man, the other was some dude they didn't really know, who was just hanging out with them for the Acid he was on while he witnessed the murder (which led police to not believe his story).

The ""Satanic Panic"" of the media in 1984 grabbed the ""DAMN DEVIL WORSHIPPERS"" aspect of the story and made him into some Cult Leader, but in reality, he was just a dumbass headbanger. He hanged himself in jail, awaiting trial.

Discovery Channel did a documentary on it called 'Satan in the Suburbs' that's also available on amazon (I think). It's pretty much everything from the story. It's 45 minutes, which is too long, and very hokey (sinister narrator dude saying things like ""It was an ordinary day, in an ordinary town, but this was no ordinary crime""...etc.) It does give every detail of it all...just.....very.....very.....slowly. Jim Van Bebber did pretty much a whole Re-Enactment film with a voice-over that told the story in 15 minutes called 'My Sweet Satan'....which is a brilliant little short film starring Van Bebber as Ricky. He updated it to 1995 and used Black Metal, but it's pretty much the story. It's in the extras on the DVD for 'Deadbeat at Dawn'.

Black Circle Boys elaborates on the story, making the ""just some guy hanging out with them for the Acid"" the heart-throb male lead and also the ""new kid in town who falls in with the wrong crowd"". Ricky (Shane in this movie) is a lot more intelligent and sinister than the real Ricky. They added a love interest and all the other crap ""needed"" for a script, and more murder and mayhem than the real story.

The acting is really, really good. The dude that plays the retard, Rory (Chad Lindberg...the real kid's name was Gary"") did a fantastic job, and the other 3 main actors were great. DONNIE WAHLBERG plays the older, creepy, gay, Satanist who teaches Shane everything. There was a real guy named Pat I think, that educated Ricky. I assume that's who Donnie's character was based on.

The story was good, except the love interest crap and the ""teen angst"" vibe of it. It also played sometimes like a Lifetime movie with the sap, but the dirty Indie side makes up for those moments.

Bloodletting, cat sacrifice, lots of imagery and pentagrams, etc. They did the film the right way on this type of stuff; don't go overboard with it, but make sure that people who know what it's all about aren't turned off cause you screwed it up.

The ending was weak and the Final Showdown wasn't really believable, but I'm not complaining. Overall it's a good little movie guaranteed to please the Metalhead within you.

There was another movie made within the last few years on this story called 'Ricky 6', but I haven't made a huge effort to find a copy yet. Ebay is my friend.",1101168000,14,3496,4.510268562401264

1074456,4,6305772592,"Here's a very disturbing little film.  It's about a young guy called Kyle (Scott Bairstow  White Fang 2, The Postman, Party of Five (tv)) whose family moves to a new (and boring) little town and he ends up attending a new high school -- trying to fit in, trying to deal with being the new guy and also trying to cope with the death of his best friend.  He goes from A student to loser in forty-five minutes, giving up being a top athlete in exchange for the acceptance of a group of heavy metal wannabes and large amounts of drugs - virtually everything from pot to lsd to crack.  His life spirals out of control.  He ends up joining the BCB who are a small group of these high school losers who practice an invented brand of Satanism in the wooded state park behind the high school.  The group's leader Shane (Eric Mabius (Party of Five (tv), Lawn Dogs, Welcome to the Dollhouse) is severely disturbed and influenced by drug dealer/fence Greggo (Donnie Wahlberg  yeah, that one -- New Kids on the Block, baby) who is the local Temple of Set devil worshiper who recruits local high school losers and gets them to rob houses for him in exchange for drugs.
The plot moves along slowly as Kyle sinks into this realm of madness, but once there, it spins wildly out of control -- there is much violence (including sick satanic rituals where the Shane kills a cat and then they dig up a skeleton) and even murder.  The acting is superb, and makes the overall effect of the film that much more disturbing.
Where are first it appears to be just another high school nostalgia film (heck, it looked like my high school), it becomes this horror film -- but way too realistic.  One keeps asking, ""where are the parents, where are the cops"" as these lowlifes rampage through the town pillaging and killing and just making all sorts of mayhem.
In the end, Kyle must fight the demons which are pulling him under, and the second half of the film chronicles his attempts to overcome the darkness which threatens to consume and destroy him.",1054425600,16,2022,4.487738419618529
1074457,4,6305772592,"When I first passed by this movie at my Blockbuster, I was intrigued by the cover and decided to investigate further by reading the back of the sleeve. ...About the movie:
The reason I bought it was that the plot had glued me to the screen and was very entertaining. The acting was superb...especially by Eric Mabius (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Crow 3). The story is about Kyle, an All-American High School swimmer, who becomes depressed after his friend dies during a celebratory party. His parents move to a new city and in order to fit in, he begins to spend time with the School headbangers- The Black Circle Boys. This group of Satan-worshipping goths/misfits begin to take up more of the Kyle's time as he becomes close with the group's leader- the fanatical Shane Carver (Eric Mabius). Fun and drugs begin to turn to criminal acts as Kyle becomes deeper involved with the group. Finally all spins out of control and results in murder.
Though some might initially categorize this movie with other teen-pop horror flicks such as Scream (maybe because of Mark Wahlberg and the young supporting cast)... [It] is a movie that does not hold back and will entertain viewers for years to come.",1008201600,,1191,4.758454106280193

I've only seen this one on late night tv, but I must say it is far from a quality film.  It is an unbelievable farce.

1074460,5,6305772592,"Well, let's see it this way.  I've seen many negative views on this movie, but all I have are extremely beautiful words to say about it.
First of all, I must say that I am a pretty hardcore fan of Eric Mabius.  I've been snatching up each and every single movie I can find with him in it.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
Mabius portrays a guy named Shane Carver, who borders a bit on the obsessed fanatic.  We see, ever since we meet him, that he is extremely obsessed with 'pleasing the Father'.  Every move he makes radiates power, and it is just amazing.
I'm not going to say more on the actors, because my main focus, after all, was on Mabius.  I will say this, though:  the acting was so realistic that I could actually imagine this happening.  I got so into the movie that one time I actually believed someone was videotaping the escapades of the Black Circle Boys.
While I found this movie highly amusing at some points, and rather dramatic at others, I'll still say this.  The drug use, explicit language, and the violence is rather extreme at some points.  Not exactly recommended for many of the younger audience.
Nevertheless, if you're looking for a good movie, here it is.  This one will keep you at the edge of your seat.",976924800,5,1271,4.343220338983051
1074461,1,6305772592,"One star for the acting, because that's all this movie's got.  Anyone who finds this movie to be fun or entertaining should go get their head  checked.  Half the moronic stunts pulled off in this movie, in all  probability, wouldn't happen.  No heart can be so cold that you would  humiliate and kill a friend without feeling any remorse. Shane is the  perona of stupidity, and to say that he's cool or any other such nonsense,  is rediculous!  I'm sorry, Kyle, but if I had a girlfriend that looked like  that, I'd ditch the Black Circle Boys in a heartbeat!  The fact that he'd  hang out with them instead of his girlfriend is improbable in itself!  Especially after having sex pool-side!  Come on, people!  Realistic?  No.  Made to be realistic with good acting?  Yes.  Overall, this movie twists  many things to fit the poor plot.  For example, Satanism is nowhere near as  stupid as it's shown to be.  There's actually a belief system involved (no  matter how stupid it may be) and they don't sacrifice or mutilate  themselves anymore, from what I've read.  Also, it wasn't the deaths of  family members that messed these two idiots up, it was the lack of  communication and love within the family during the grieving process.  To  be blunt and to the point: this movie is dumb.  Waste your money on a good  book or something.",966816000,2,1331,4.603448275862069

There is a lot of drug use and  violence in this movie, so if you don't want to see either I suggest you  don't rent this movie. You probably won't like it. There are two or three  somewhat brutal scenes and most of what the BCB does is in relation to how  much drugs they have done or how much they need.

1074549,5,6305772592,"I didn't originally intend to write a review of this movie, but after reading the previous one, I felt I had to input my opinion. I completely disagree with the author of the other review when he says this is 'the type  of movie you wish was never made.' I thoroughly enjoyed the entire show. I  thought the actors were excellent and the plot was quite interesting. The  only problem I found with this movie was that it wrongfully portrays  Satanism, as do many television programs, books, movies, etc. I'm not here  to educate the public about Satanists, but I will just say this. Human  and/or animal sacrifices are NOT a common practice among Satanists. Few  people, much like the boys in the movie, deem themselves 'Satanists' when  in actuality, they are not. But as for the movie, it held my interest the  whole time and, in my opinion, deserves a 5 star rating. If you are the  type of person who is interested in experiencing a different sort of movie  and can handle a bit of graphic content, I would definitely recommend it  for your 'Must See' list.",962841600,4,1060,4.550264550264551
1074550,5,6305772592,"Since when did clean-cut Hollywood hunks become a part of the goth' scene? While the occult has probably never looked so good or so polished, Black Circle Boys is an example of the type of movie that you wish was never  made. From an over-reliance on script clich&eacute;s to a plot that can be mapped  out by viewers within the first five minutes, this is a bad movie, plain  and simple. Except for glimpses of capable acting by the young cast, my  feelings for Black Circle Boys would have gone as low as the religious  figure the characters in the movie come to worship.
Kyle (Scott  Bairstow) lived the happy suburban-American life. He was an All-American  swimmer with a bright future. But then, tragedy hit (let the melodramatic  music roll). During a rooftop party in celebration of Kyle's All-American  selection, Kyle's brother fell several stories to his death. Rather than  talk about the pain and deal with it, Kyle's father packs up the family and  moves to a new suburban town hoping to suppress the family's sorrows.
Kyle begins anew at a school with a pecking order he was not yet a part  of. Before long, Kyle gets involved with the contemporary group of boys  ""from the other side of the tracks"" - the Black Circle Boys. Led by Shane  (Eric Mabius), this is a small, but loyal, cult. Shane seduces Kyle with  promises of drugs, alcohol and great power. With nobody else to turn to,  Kyle goes along with the bad boys and the results are predictable.
You  might be wondering, ""Where's the girl? You can't have a clich&eacute;-riddled film  without a pretty girl."" Well, her name is Chloe (Tara Subkoff), and she  becomes Kyle's link with the ""real"" world. Will she bring him back to the  good side? I'm confident you will figure it out.
Much of Black Circle  Boys' subject matter is disturbing. I still cannot come up with a good  reason why there are scenes such as the tossing of a cat against a tree.  This is pure cruelty, and isn't intended to have comical undertones. While  scenes like these take us close to the world that Shane and the other Black  Circle Boys inhabit, they are excessive and unnecessary. Some might think  the film deserves a plus for realism, but for me, it is just taking things  too far.
The cast of this weak film does deserve some credit. While none  should be clearing a spot on the mantle for a golden statue, there are  glimpses of stars in the making. Since Black Circle Boys was filmed in  1997, Bairstow has gone on to roles in Wild America, The Postman and  television's Party of Five. Mabius has acted in Cruel Intentions, and  Subkoff played the college girl in American Pie. Don't be surprised if  these names pop up on lists of up-and-coming stars in the near future. But  for the present, you'd be well advised to keep Black Circle Boys off your  list of possible renters.",960422400,2,2833,4.586826347305389

Satanism is a  religion which worships life and the bloody practices of the punks in the  movie are not accurate.  A very bad movie.",943660800,,307,4.826923076923077

The actors portray a REALLY authentic, true-to-life state of fresh, original teenage rebellion, anger, and questioning authority.  This movie also is a great depiction of the possible behavior and mind-set of a teenage boy whose brother has just died in an accident and is angry and feeling shortchanged by his loss.  And Eric Mabius is SO seriously hot in this movie to boot!",1498608000,,434,4.917808219178082
7894959,4,6305772592,"This is a good film. I think reviewers tend to rush to a bad review, when the movie is too complex for them to understand. This film was based on a true story, so it would be pretentious for movie viewers to expect a perfect story-line. The truth is stranger and much more haphazard than fiction. It was also apparent the character Shane had a homosexual attraction to Kyle, of which added to his already unhinged demeanor and the complexity of the story. I recommend this film. It is the true epitome of teens going off the deep end and resorting to desperate actions.",1498608000,2,569,4.480769230769231
