8090303,4,B000BOW27O,"the shipping was in a timely manner, new condition, this has help me cultivate my already extensive practice, has also given great deal of helpful tips while learning, and or achieving advanced tai chi skill",1209254400,,207,4.942857142857143
8090304,2,B000BOW27O,"One really dumb idea was to record her sequence while she was standing in tall grass. I know, it's romantic and beautiful and at one with nature etc., but we need to see the feet. Duh.

My second gripe is about the lost opportunity. To do this right, you need two, maybe three views. One view would be with her back to the camera, so we can follow without transposing our left and right. Another would be a moving camera that is always facing her back, so that, as the movement revolves, we can maintain orientation.

I do like the organization and the idea, here.",1206403200,3,564,4.3619047619047615
8090305,5,B000BOW27O,"I have been taking Tai Chi since November, 2006, using the Yang Style Simplified Form, which is the subject of this video.  I was pleased with the depth of the presentation in the video, together with the ""martial basis"" of many of the elements in the form.  Quite frankly, before I started Tai Chi, I thought of it as ""martial arts in slow motion"" or more of a dance than anything else.

Over the months, I have developed a better understanding of tai chi ch'uan, and I consider this DVD to be a useful adjunct to my regular weekly classes.  One thing I feel that I must emphasize is that this DVD video is not a substitute for the organized classes you can take. However, it is an effective introduction to the health benefits available through Tai Chi.  For those who are current students, Robin Linde's style in executing the 24 forms is ""impeccable"" and her explanations of the martial origins of the style are first rate.  Many of those of us who practice Tai Chi are not regular practitioners of other martial arts.  We are involved in the practice of Tai Chi for the advantages it gives us in developing balance, strength, and flexibility.  For those who are regular practitioners, there are psychological advantages in Tai Chi as a form of ""moving meditation."" The health advantages offered by Tai Chi have been documented in medical journals.  This DVD presents both the style and form of Tai Chi, together with background necessary to give a basic understanding of this art.

My Tai Chi instructor has seen the video and is presently recommending it to his classes",1183420800,5,1575,4.673913043478261
8090306,5,B000BOW27O,This DVD is beautiful.  It is the perfect complement to my practice.  i have been looking for something to help jump start a self practice and this is it!  Since i have been using this my practice with my instructor has improved and I am doing tai chi more.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1153699200,8,287,4.2592592592592595
8090307,5,B000BOW27O,"I've been practicing for a few years with a number of teachers. This dvd is great to study and practice along with. Love the additional commentary and tricks for practice...just what my teacher said. Great addition to my collection

8090308,5,B000BOW27O,"There is so much more to this DVD than I thought!  I have to admit that even after a friend of mine recommended this DVD to me, I was skeptical about buying it after reading Mark Zukoff's bad review.  I took a chance and I'm so glad that I did!  I really don't see what Mark is talking about.  Robin Linde's DVD is such a breath of fresh air.  Really there is nothing out there like it.  Its true that she does not ""teach"" you Tai Chi, but rather what she does it provide a beautiful program with all 24 moves for you to practice with on your own.  I really like the ability to repeat a move in various speeds so I can compare what I am doing to her form.  You can watch the entire 24 step sequence with or without commentary.  Robin faces the camera, like Dr. Lam does but she also adds another camera angle thats shot from sorta the side.  I personally liked it because you can see what's going on.  The scenery is beautiful shot outdoors in like a tropical forest or something.  Sometimes the grass covers her feet, but that never really bothered me.  Oh, also her commentary talks about the martial arts applications for each move.  This was fascinating!  I've never heard any of this before.  Its actually kinda funny to think about the slow graceful moves as self defense.  It was a suprise to find that and while I'll only look at that part once, it really helped me to think about what I am doing and why I am doing it.

I also bought the Scott Cole & Dr Lam's videos.  Both have a lot to offer, but I'm not really into the whole ""new-agey"" thing that Cole's video makes you sit through.  The scenery is beautiful, and he is a hunk, but his forms are SO Different from what I've been taught that I really can't use Scott's video in my practice.  Dr. Lam's video is good too, but his long winded explanations are hard to follow and I had a hard time understanding his thick accent.  I'm going to keep Lam's video for reference and to get another perspective from my teacher.  However, Robin's DVD is my favorite.

Ten Reasons Why I LOVE Robin Linde's DVD:

1. I can easily jump to any of the 24 steps and review in detail without long explanations

2. Her commentary on the martial arts applications is fascinating and unique

3. Its refreshing to see a woman beautifully demonstrate Tai Chi (I can relate to her better!)

4. The ""Tips for Your Practice Section"" is very Helpful

5. There is a bonus meditation section with animation and music that at first I thought was goofy, but now I find myself using all the time to relax (its not Tai Chi, but its fun)

Overall, this is an excellent DVD that does exactly what I wanted it to: help me with my practice when I am not in class.  It doesn't replace a teacher and Robin tells you that up front.  Its easy to use and get what I want quickly without having to fast forward, rewind or listen to a lot of talking.  You can't learn Tai Chi from a DVD, but you can learn more about Tai Chi and see the best of the best demonstrate their form.  Sometimes you can get bonuses like Robin offers.  My advice is to buy several DVDs and take the best from each.  If you only buy one, buy this one.",1153353600,23,3145,4.218120805369128
8090309,1,B000BOW27O,"I tried the Scott Cole beginning Tai-Chi(excellent) and figured this was more instruction and all 24 poses. Yes, she does the poses but it is impossible to follow. The camera angles do not allow for the study of the hand or feet positions and she offers no explaination., This is a complete waste of money. I am returning it to Amazon for my 50% loss.",1151539200,10,351,4.415384615384616
8090310,5,B000BOW27O,"This DVD is a prescription for ""anyone"" who seeks the path to peace. Robin Linde is a practioner of transcendancy. Tai Chi is merely her tool to getting you there. More importantly, she practices what she preaches. I have had the opportunity of working with her on multiple projects, where atmospheres were very tense! Her mere entrance into the room produced such a calming effect - Peace! I first watched this DVD while preparing dinner for myself, while going through the dissolution of a relationship. Without practicing a single move, I found myself being restored, inspired and on the road to spiritual, mental and physical rejuvenation. It was just what the doctor ordered. I can't wait to see her next production. Well done!",1130544000,11,732,4.959349593495935
8090311,5,B000BOW27O,"Robin is an amazing tai chi instructor.  As her student I have been able to see her dedication to the art first-hand.  The DVD is a perfect supplement for beginning students' learning as well as a useful tool for seasoned practice.  The break down of steps at various speed makes it easy for any level of student to follow along.  This DVD is a necessity for anyone who wants to progress in their practice of tai chi, regardless of skill level.",1129075200,12,444,4.444444444444445
