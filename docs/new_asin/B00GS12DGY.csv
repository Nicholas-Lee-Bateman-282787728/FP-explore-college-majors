8626586,5,B00GS12DGY,An opportunity to gain a different and more challenging opinion of what the Spanish Civil War was really like as opposed to the current modern leftist propaganda that sullies the principles of truth..,1464048000,,200,5.090909090909091
8626587,5,B00GS12DGY,"An incredible movie. Just amazing. It's the Spanish Cristiada ""For Greater Glory"".
Very Catholic.  I recommend the Bluray edition for pristine video quality. It is worth it.
This will be an automatic Lenten movie. Viva Cristo Rey!
Worth the wait from Spain. You won't find it stateside. Subtitles are in English.",1462752000,2,312,5.117647058823529
8626588,5,B00GS12DGY,This is a great film.  What is amazing to me is that all this happened so long ago and yet we are still there imposing our religious beliefs on others. Now again.,1424217600,,162,4.0625
8626589,5,B00GS12DGY,"Wonderful film that recounts the last few months of life of these seminarians in July 1936, when the war was about to erupt.
Detailed with historical accuracy and verisimilitude the hardships and humiliations suffered by anarchist militiamen.
Irrationality and hatred come it to justify everything.
Here are some of the phrases from the film,
""people have to know that if they are not with us we expect terror""
It contains some extras, including deleted scenes etc...
It is subtitled to several languages, English, French, Portuguese, Italian.
I recommend to all lovers of good cinema and history.",1401494400,5,597,5.229166666666667
8626590,5,B00GS12DGY,Loved it. Liked it even more than For Greater Glory. The film focuses more on martyrdom than on the actual conflict.,1397433600,2,116,4.571428571428571
