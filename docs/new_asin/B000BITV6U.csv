8087080,4,B000BITV6U,"I consider this series to sorta be like a 1950s version of YouTube. Some of the segments are still interesting, some are not. Which is what is sorta cool about this series. It's a fun mix of good and bad.

I write this review simply to leave a note to TV historians interested in getting this DVD: The commercials are intact, and the while the back-cover mentions ABC (which the series moved to during 1952), these four episodes seem to largely date from 1951, meaning they aired on the long-defunct DuMont Television Network, which is sorta legendary in TV history circles as the original ""forth network"", even though they pre-dated both CBS and ABC in terms of regular television broadcasts (starting regular network broadcasts in 1946). The network had ceased broadcasting by the end of August 1956...

My biggest complaint is that the DVD publisher puts a stupid watermark during the opening & closing titles of each episode.",1335657600,,929,4.8734177215189876
8087081,2,B000BITV6U,"I love watching early tv but this show is dated and no longer holds much interest. One viewer asks to see an octopus. Why would anyone do this? Well, this is 1952, television is new, and the Discovery channel is still 45 years in the future. Unless you lived near a major aquarium, this might be your only chance to see an octopus. Other requests include third rate vaudeville acts, a song from from Al Jolson's brother, seeing an eskimo build an igloo (since that takes too long, we see him put one block of ice on an igloo), etc. Boring",1177545600,2,538,4.336633663366337
8087082,4,B000BITV6U,I enjoyed both this and Volume 2.  I can remeber quite well watching this TV show when I was a kid.  It's worth taking the trip back in time.,1174089600,3,141,3.8275862068965516
