7994475,1,B00009ZK6E,"I got this DVD about two months ago and can only now bring myself to review it.  This DVD is just awful.  1 star is the minimum scale on the Amazon scale otherwise I would have given it a 0.

 It has heavy static line that mars the picture up until about the five minute mark.  It clears up but is soon replaced by a blank grey screen which flicks in an out with maybe a couple of seconds of footage between each grey screen.  this continues on until about the 12 minute mark.

 No problems with the picture and Im actually getting to watch something when bang! Grey screen again at about the 15 minute mark right through until the end.  I tried watching the DVD in a few different machines but it just won't work.

This on top of an appaling sound track, total lack of commentary after about the 5 minute mark and the distinct lack, from what I could see between the flickering grey screens, of MAS OYAMA makes this product worse than rubbish.

I am a practioner of Kyokushin Karate and was excited at the thought of getting a rare insight into the master of this style.  But this certainly wasn't it!

My appologies to any who have purchased this product between the time I bought it and placed this review",1095120000,14,1208,4.292035398230088
7994476,1,B00009ZK6E,"I paid 30 bucks for this 23 minute DVD, and only 5-10 minutes (and ten would be very generous) are actually of Mas Oyama, and a lot of that ten minutes is the same footage repeated (guess it must be hard to fill 23 minutes).  What's the rest?  I'd love to tell you, but this DVD was of such incredibly poor quality that the majority of the scenes were unplayable -- just a gray screen with music that sounded like a Japanese John Tesch scoring a porn movie.

Just to give you an idea of the Oyama/Not Oyama ratio and the gross misrepresentation of the DVD's title, imagine ordering a ""Star Wars"" DVD and getting two hours of  people playing shuffle board.  Now imagine every ten minutes or so George Lucas appears on screen and waves a Luke Skywalker action figure back and forth for five seconds while he makes light saber noises.

From what I could see, however, the non-Oyama parts were a combination of tournament footage and various guys breaking stuff.  Maybe they're Oyama students, I don't know.  There was no commentary, and no clues in the pseudo-porn music that may have revealed the performers' top-secret identities.

One really nice touch was the line of static -- much like the ""bad tracking"" static you used to see on VHS tapes -- that obscured those rare times that THE GRAY VOID OF NOTHINGNESS did not consume the entire video screen.  You just can't buy special effects like that for less than thirty bucks for 23 minutes.

I gave this DVD one star because I had to (there's no zero on Amazon's scale); however, it's an easy five stars for any industry watchdogs, consumer advocacy groups, class action attorneys, or law enforcement agencies that are looking for unscrupulous, weasely, DVD distributors to harass.  These guys should be ashamed of themselves.  Oh wait, maybe they are.  Here's a direct quote from the Product Details page: ""Studio: (studio name not provided).""  Who can blame them?

Oh, I forgot to mention.  This thirty dollar coaster didn't even come shrink-wrapped -- a small piece of scotch tape held the case closed.  Pretty classy, eh?",1093046400,17,2076,4.719444444444444
