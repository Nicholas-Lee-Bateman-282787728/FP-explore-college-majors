7912032,3,B00000JGKY,"The mere existence of this compilation package affirms Don Wilson's status as a bankable star within the low budget realm. Wilson is arguably the most successful action hero of the direct-to-video circuit, and for his efforts, he got his own DVD ""Dragon Pack"" - a multi-film collection that hasn't been afforded to other DTV stars like Cynthia Rothrock or Daniel Bernhardt. I'm not a huge fan of Don's, but I'm glad that this package includes some of his better features.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist-III-Forced-to-Fight/dp/630582472X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist III: Forced to Fight</a>&nbsp;is the last starring vehicle of Wilson's to enjoy a cinematic release, though the reduced budget is clear to see. It's a prison flick, though not nearly as bleak and gritty as is the norm for these (though there's still room for a rape scene within the opening minutes). The action features some of the better hand-to-hand encounters that Wilson's enjoyed, though the abortive exchange between Don and fellow kickboxer Stan Longinidis is still lamentable. Wilson's low-key acting serves him well, but he can't hold a candle to co-star Richard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaft/dp/0790743752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaft</a>&nbsp;Roundtree.

(the movie would later be remade as the Jerry Trimble vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-by-the-Fist/dp/B000087F2B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live by the Fist</a>. Trimble's feature has superior action, but Wilson's version tells the story better and showcases superior acting)

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist-IV-Die-Trying/dp/6305824738/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist IV: Die Trying</a>&nbsp;is, among the three, probably the most conventional and well-rounded action flick of the bunch, though the karate content outweighs gunfire and explosions. It's also the most packed with real-life martial arts champions, albeit their utilization could be better: Don's primary opponent is the awesome Gary Daniels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Tiger/dp/B0009ETCZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Tiger</a>), though the fights they have don't come close to the quality of brawl Daniels is capable of. There is a good deal of appreciable humor, however: an important plot point involves nuclear detonators hidden inside Easter chocolates.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackbelt/dp/B00006II6D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackbelt</a>, oddly placed after its chronological successor, is the weakest offering and my least favorite of the three. Wilson plays a bodyguard protecting a rock singer from an obsessive stalker, played by Matthias Hues (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender-2/dp/B0002ISFZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender 2</a>). Hues' character is written as such a weirdo that he should be entertaining to watch, but he hardly has any acting scenes, and his fight scenes - along with Wilson's - are uncomfortable blocked and edited. It's not a boring movie but not exactly an adrenaline-booster, either.

A bigger fan of ""The Dragon"" may rate this collection higher, but even with only three stars, it's a nice set to own for folks who watch his movies regularly.",1393459200,3,3484,7.093023255813954
7912033,2,B00000JGKY,"I guess I can't blame Don Wilson.  He probably needed the money and why not make a cheap cheesy flick or three.  No where near any of Lee's films, or even Van Damme, Norris, Seagall, etc.  Very average or bad acting even with Richard Roundtree in one film.  Wilson lacks any beleivable emotional range and the fight scenes are overly choreographed and come off as slow and fake.",1350086400,,378,4.514705882352941
