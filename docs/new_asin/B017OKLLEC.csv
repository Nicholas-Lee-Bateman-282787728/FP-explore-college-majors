8739967,5,B017OKLLEC,A truly inspiring video with beautiful nature in the background. The video presents very useful new research by Elaine and others. It made me feel much better about me and my son who are both sensitive. I no longer think there is something wrong with us. It's just a personality type. The video gives a lot of good tools for dealing with work and personal live which all of us in the family have already started using with great results.,1448064000,20,437,4.475
