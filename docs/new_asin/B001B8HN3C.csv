The story begins at a cattle ranch where the cowboys sing. A man rides in with a telegram for Buck: the holdups of the stage line require his help at Mesa City. A stagecoach arrives with a wounded driver: another robbery. Buck Roberts arrives in town to get his cattle. Another man walks into the bar, and asks the men to sing. They do! The miners want to change shippers, Taggart will guarantee delivery. This preacher wins at poker! Buck will drive the stagecoach via a short cut. But an eavesdropper overhears his plans. Miss Ruth asks the miners for one more chance to ship their gold. The miners agree. Buck will drive, Joe comes along. The robbers have a plan to blame Buck. They plant empty Wells Fargo money bags in his saddlebags!

The angry citizens fall for this scheme. Sandy Hopkins wants his money for the cattle sale. Buck jumps out of the jail window. McCall tells how the box was switched to save the gold shipment. Steve Taggart's gang got rocks. Some invade the Express office to get this gold. There is a big shoot-out in town. What can Buck do in the saloon? McCall empties the Express office. Taggart doesn't escape justice. There are extra passengers on the outgoing stagecoach. The three Rough Riders split up to return home. We will see them again on another adventure to bring justice where its needed.

This story uses the usual plots of a prominent business man who secretly controls a gang of robbers. And a hero who wrongfully falls under suspicion. It seems better than the average western of that era. The famous Coconut Grove fire in November 1942 Boston killed over 400 people, one of them was Buck Jones. This tavern ignored the fire regulations so hundreds were trapped due to a lack of fire exits. Tim McCoy, an authentic cowboy, rejoined the Army and became a Colonel.",1287878400,,1832,4.630769230769231
