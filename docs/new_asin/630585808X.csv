1105786,5,630585808X,"Tenchi Universe is a complete retelling of the OVA series, only with a few story changes, new twists, new adventures, and of course, new characters. The first new twist is the introduction of Ryoko and Mihoshi. Ryoko being  found injured on the road under a tree by Tenchi, instead of in the cave as  in the OVA series. Mihoshi appearing a lot sooner, trying to arrest Ryoko.  At least the original characters haven't changed. Mihosho is still a ditzy,  clumsy galazy police detective. Whose in the cave this time around? You'll  just have to watch and find out. Charcter designs are the same as the OVA,  but the animation is well ahead. Humour abounds, as does the action. You  won't believe half the stuff that they get themselves into. A tremendous  series.",958089600,24,761,4.712121212121212
1105904,1,630585808X,"I watch a lot of anime.  I mean, a LOT of anime.  When I read all these rave reviews of Tenchi and was told by numerous people it was ""a classic"" I thought, ""Well, dang, I gotta see THAT.""
Well, I rented the TV series on DVD.  I've got it set to Japanese with subtitles.  I've watched over half of it.  I've laughed...uh...once.
I have no idea why people love this series.  I really don't.  Maybe the OVAs are just SO GOOD that people who have seen it and then gone to watch the TV series have been compelled to love it.  But I haven't seen the OVAs, and I can tell you the TV series stinks.  It's just not funny.  It's not even compelling.  The characters I've seen done better on other anime series.  And that blonde ought to be drop-kicked out of the galaxy.  She's annoying, and she adds nothing to the story.
If you love Tenchi, I guess you'll love this.  If you really want a comedy about romantic triangles and strange going-ons, watch Ranma or Fushigi Yuugi.  Stear clear of this title, though.  There's no funny in there.",998438400,4,1030,4.286458333333333
1105905,5,630585808X,"The only reason I've become an anime otaku was because of this series. It was the basis for my love for Japanese animation and its hilarious storylines.
Even though this series differs a bit from that of the OAV, you will definitely enjoy the endless humor extracted from the colorful characters and adventures they encounter. The story begins with Ryoko, who falls down to Earth after being chased by Mihoshi, a bumbling Galaxy Police officer. Tenchi finds Ryoko, who is suffering from a bad hangover. Tenchi reluctantly brings her home. Mihoshi eventually comes to live with them, despite her mission to arrest Ryoko. Mihoshi can be such a ditz ;_;. Aeka, the First Princess of Jurai, also comes to live with Tenchi and all the other girls follow. Sasami, the lovable girl with a hidden past. Washu, the brilliant genius. Kiyone, a determined Galaxy Police officer thirsty for a promotion. Even though she wasn't in the OAV, Kiyone is an essential part of Tenchi Universe.
I recommend this DVD for ages 13 and up. There's some mature content and jokes if you understand them. Especially when Ryoko trieds to get Tenchi in a cave, where Washu is imprisoned inside a meteorite. You'll love this DVD.",998179200,,1199,4.853658536585366
1105906,5,630585808X,"This was my first Tenchi movie I bought. I thought the four episodes were great after watching them. There were great and funny parts, too in the shows. My favorite was No Need For Monsters because it was funny, but Ryoko does some stuff that needs parental guidence for little kids. But not BAD stuff! I also love to look in the art section for a DVD extra, but I was a little dissapointed about the DVD extra for character descriptions. They make you read this little print summary of each person, but the video clip was ok.",996451200,,526,4.377551020408164
1105907,5,630585808X,"Directed by Hiroki Hayashi, produced by AIC (other credits include Gall Force, Bubblegum Crisis, El Hazard...), Tenchi Universe was the remake of the OAV series Tenchi Muyo.  Unlike the OAVs, Tenchi Universe has a  distinct beginning, middle, and ending.  It takes the great ideas created  in the OAV and organizes them, creating a beautiful story that has as much  sadness and depth as comedy and cuteness.
A parody on mainstream science  fiction, Tenchi pokes fun at everything from Star Wars to Sailor Moon to  Bonnie and Clyde.  It begins with a number of attractive female aliens  crash landing on earth and meeting a young boy named Tenchi.  Romantic  rivlary ensues between the female leads; Ryoko the Space Pirate and Ayeka  the Princess of Jurai.  The plot thickens in the second season when Ayeka  recieves word that a coup has taken place on Jurai, and that she is now a  wanted war criminal.  This spurns on a space oddyssey which leads the  characters to discover not only who it is who has taken over the planet  Jurai, but also why fate chose Tenchi as the earthling to help save it.  And, by the end, you know who Tenchi's true love is.  That is something the  OAV can't promise.
All in all, Tenchi Universe is a must see.  And, while  some would argue that the OAV began better, Tenchi Universe has one of the  best endings I have ever seen in any anime series, or any television  program for that matter.  Give it a chance, and I think you'll agree with  me.",964310400,,1476,4.576923076923077
1105908,3,630585808X,"The Tenchi saga retold, this series was made for broadcast television, and sadly, it shows. The animation is more limited than in the original OVAs, and the character coloring, while technically correct, seems too  ""Saturday Morning-ish"". With 7 more volumes to go, the OAV is a  much better investment.
However, this DVD does have its perks. The  finger puppets included with the video are useless, but just the kind of  kawaii(cute) extras otaku(fans) drool for. Also, like other Tenchi DVD's,  this one contains lots of pencil sketches and the openings/endings sans  credits. And if you're a Washu fan, take heart. She shows up by the 4th  episode! ^_^",962409600,11,655,5.0092592592592595
1105909,4,630585808X,"I'll rate that the DVD itself was pretty good (although it didn't have  much in the way of special features). The color and sharpness are stunning;  just as they should be on a good DVD, and the sound is a clear advancement  from the VHS version of Tenchi Universe.  However, fans of Tenchi Muyo  looking for a story just as great as the ""legendary"" OAV aren't  in for much when it comes to this Tenchi TV series. The stories are not  nearly as in-depth as the OAV, and the characters are hardly developed.  Many of the plotlines are toned-down, perhaps to suit a younger audience  for easier understanding. However, the series is still worthwhile to see  for any Tenchi fan.  And for those of you who have seen Tenchi Muyo only  on its Cartoon Network debut-- I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase Tenchi  Muyo, both the TV and OAV series -- as they were originally meant to be;  before all the dubbing and extreme editting.",962323200,8,924,4.5212121212121215
1105910,3,630585808X,"If you've watched the OVA, you're not missing much here. Tenchi Universe  simply doesn't live up to the standards of the OVA. This series is good,  but it's nost fantastic.
What hurts it? The thing that harms it the most  is the really bad characterizations. For instance, in this series Ryoko  went into a life of crime by choice, losing a lot of her softer side,  Aeka's a real witch at times, and Mihoshi's just plain dumb. Washu's devoid  of any characterization whatsoever now.
What else hurts this? Plot. The  plot is rather weak. Over half the series is filler. The ""main  plot"" involving a coup on Jurai is not interesting at all, and ends up  hitting a lot of cliches along the way. Only Ryoko and Aeka are after  Tenchi this time around, so it's now a love triangle. But you'll keep  asking yourself ""why?"" as the reasoning behind why they're after  him is weak and not well thought out.
This is pretty much a dumbed down  OVA series that's no more then a romantic comedy. It's entertaining,  definitly, but it's just not excellent. When there's newer stuff out there  like Cowboy Bebop available at a better price/content ratio then this  rather dated series that isn't even that hot, it makes you wonder why it's  worth picking up. The series itself would get four stars, but due to the  lack of any discount for the series' datedness (I would just be upgrading  older copies) it dropped the grade a bit more. Check out Bebop, Trigun,  Blue Sub, or one of the other new series, or stick to the much better OVA.",959558400,,1522,4.525735294117647

7899099,5,630585808X,"Ryoko the space pirate, Ayeka the princess, her sister Sasami, Mihoshi the cop, and Washu the mad scientist all find there way to a remote lake where a high school boy named Tenchi Masaki lives. His life was peaceful and slow paced, but now he has more than he can handle. They are all connected, as they will soon find out. Their combined strength and their bond will ultimately save the universe.

This was the very first DVD that I ever bought. I saw this show on toonami after school. I immediately went out and bought a DVD player, and the first 3 volumes. Tenchi Universe was the show that got me into watching anime. Now I'm a huge fan and I have over 300 different series. It's all because of this TV series. Tenchi Universe is also, in my opinion, the best Tenchi series. There are around 8 of them or so, including spin offs. If you haven't seen any Tenchi yet, then I recommend starting with this one. It's tons of fun. It has action, adventure, comedy, romance, and drama. It is animated well, and the voice cast is very memorable. All the characters are also unforgettable. You don't want to miss this awesome series.",1353024000,,1130,4.458937198067633
7899100,5,630585808X,`Tenchi Universe' is the third Tenchi Muyo series... volume 1 shows how Tenchi met Ryoko and the others (very comedy themed and a lot of irony). If you haven't seen the original OVA series or Tenchi In Tokyo... no need to panic.  Very entertaining.,1283644800,,248,4.636363636363637

7899102,5,630585808X,"Tenchi Universe is 26 episodes, starting with the first four on this DVD.  This DVD is important because it does bring in most of the major characters that will be starring within the series itself.  We first meet Tenchi walking along in his school uniform.  Seconds later there is a explosion as a spaceship crashes.  He finds the blue haired Ryoko, who is drunk, and claims she is being chased by a space pirate.  That's when the powered suit pops up and starts blasting.  We later learn that this is Galaxy Police Detective Mihoshi and Ryoko is in fact the space pirate.  Let me add that the powered armour suit looks VERY cool, but doesn't do well against wooden swords.
Things become calmer after Ryoko refuses to allow Mihoshi to arrest her.  Mihosho sends off a SOS and soon Princess Ayeka arrives.  She and Ryoko have bad blood between them, get into a space battle with their ships and both ships end up damaged which makes Mihoshi cry.  But soon Princess Sasami shows up to save them all.  And her ship is wrecked also.  Mihoshi cries.
Now that they are all trapped on Earth, they all decide to help with the chores; Sasami cooks, Ayeka and Mihoshi do house work and Ryoko goofs off. After learning about the monster in the shrine, from Grandfather Katsuhito, the gang end up releasing Washu.  Well, it's Ryoko's fault but let's not point fingers.
The first DVD is funny, allows us to get a good idea about the characters and really hooks you into the whole TV series.",1087603200,,1478,4.553030303030303
7899103,5,630585808X,"Tenchi Universe is the best Tenchi TV series.  It stars everyone from ""Tenchi Muyo!"" and it's longer and better.
  Tenchi is a teenage boy that finds two women from outer space. One of them is a space pirate, the other is a member of the Galaxy Police, looking for the space pirate Ryoko.
