3729436,3,B001OBBR38,"Voltron Volume 8 is a three-disc DVD set that includes the final sixteen episodes of the Vehicle Voltron series.  It is packaged in a box that features Krik's vehicle on the front.  The first two discs in the set contain six episodes, while the third disc contains four episodes and trailers.  The trailers included on the disc are for Alteil, Berserk Remaster, Ah My Budda, and Tweeny Witches.  I was extremely disappointed by the fact that the only ""special feature"" included on this set were trailers.  I sincerely wish that the features included on Voltron Volume 6 had been spread out between the three sets, so this situation didn't end up happening.

As for the episodes themselves, it becomes even more obvious on this set just how much World Events was having to either cover up or remove completely when it came to content, especially visual content having to do with death.  Unfortunately, a lot of the covering up that was done made very little sense, and ultimately weakened the story.  For example, in one episode, it was claimed that the Explorer was heading to a Drule base for peace negotiations.  However, it's very obvious from the visuals that they were there for an attack from the get-go; the peace negotiations were covering up the fact that our heroes were being the aggressors.  There were also times in the episodes where the tone of voice and words being used in the English dub did not match up with the expressions on the characters' faces; as a viewer, I found this to be a distraction.

The worst cover-ups, however, came in the last couple of episodes in the series.  For example, the edits made to the end of the second-to-last episode created a continuity error at the beginning of the final episode.  Also, the cover-ups and changes also watered down the intensity of the action that is readily apparent in the visuals.  In a lot of respects, I was personally disappointed with a lot of the episodes on this final set.

Personally, I would only recommend this box set to die-hard fans of Vehicle Voltron who want to own the entire series on DVD.
