8166179,5,B000M4C1II,"It is a drag that the movie has been altered. For instance, in the great opening scene, it is a different, live version of the song ""nightclubbing"" playing, At least 2 other songs are also not the same. I read Lech Kowalski is very unhappy about this. Still, this is such a great classic movie. The main focus is the Sex Pistols tour of America. The footage is spectacular, and there is really cool footage from the UK bands and scene at the time, as well as California. The movie is like a mish mash of a bunch of things, I like that there is no real plot or focus, its a lot of cool footage of the punk scene at the time, and lots of footage of fans and other people, its a fascinating time capsule. Though this dvd release is flawed, Id still recommend it. The bonus feature of a full length documentary is great; I would have liked  commentaries though. I found it irritating that I paid 27 dollars on amazon when this came out, now its 8 or 9 dollars cheaper. Why should real fans, who want to buy things right when they come out, have to pay more money? IN the future I will wait a few months to buy new releases as the price seems to drop.",1519257600,,1146,4.139013452914798
8166180,1,B000M4C1II,"Buyer beware...This is not the same cut as the original. The Augustus Pablo song at the end credits has been replaced with another reggae song which I don't even think is a dub song from the 70's era. Also the tape hiss on the transfer is almost unbearable. It sounds like they just transferred the film off of a VHS copy. Mind you this is a great document of the time, but it is a little pricey. I only recommend buying if you are a die-hard Pistols fan.
Other than that it's not really worth it...",1518739200,,499,4.208333333333333
8166181,1,B000M4C1II,"""Reissue - repackage -repackage"" so sang some wit of the 80s about the cynical treatment of fans towards their 'idols'. It applies here, of course. I owned this fascinating slice of history when it finally reached the seller's shelves in the early 80s. It's a good look at the famous British band as it lurched across the U.S.A. The footage of two zonked-out herion fiends on a bed trying to appear 'normal' is Classic and worth the price alone. Unfortunately the price is too much for a 'normal' person to consider, so if you can hire it a store than please do. What the Media labelled as Punk at its verging with the Mainstream in the late 70s was already finished by its supposed 'height' of 1978 (when radio really started playing 'watered-down punk - or PunkLite).
 The film is rightly a classic.",1516752000,,801,4.601398601398602
8166182,5,B000M4C1II,"A must for EVERY Sex Pistols fan!  This is the Sex Pistols documentary that you never heard of.  Grab it now while you can.  Also features cool performances by the Rich Kids, Generation X abd X Ray Spex plus a whole lot more.  Great documentary on the making of the documentary is included too!",1515628800,,294,4.388888888888889
8166183,3,B000M4C1II,"Decent documentary, not great. Was a bit of a struggle to get through, but an important historical document nonetheless.",1515456000,,120,5.368421052631579
8166184,3,B000M4C1II,"When the punk music scene began I was never a huge fan. It was only after time that I began to enjoy the music, at least some of it, and to appreciate what the genre was trying to accomplish. There was one thing about it that I noticed and that was the fact that it was only a major musical genre if you lived on either coast. Certainly there were band across the US that took to the style but the only areas where it was of major influence were New York, LA and England. Did it influence bands after? Perhaps but more so because of the press than because of actually seeing the bands perform.

That being said D.O.A. is a documentary about one of the biggest bands of the genre, the Sex Pistols, and there short tour of the US in 1978 that ended with the band breaking up. At least thats whats at the center of the film. In addition to that it takes a look at the entire punk rock scene. Interviews with various punks at the time as well as those who just didn't think much of the scene are mingled in with performances by other top bands as well.

Among those bands are The Dead Boys, Generation X (with Billy Idol), The Rich Kids, the X-Ray Spex, and Sham 69. All feature that hard edged, fast played, guitar driven sound that is synonymous with punk rock as well as lyrics that display an anger towards the world. The fact that so few of these bands have found their way to film, video or discs makes this film one that punk rock fans will want to pick up.

While the movie is supposed to be about that ill-fated tour it jumped around far too much for me to enjoy. One moment were watching the band get ready to tour, then they're performing, then we move on to a different band, then the interviews and then somewhere else. There is no cohesive timeframe being followed here. The film is more Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; than straight documentary and that adds to the confusion for more mainstream viewers. Its an observation rather than an attempt to tell the story of what happened.

One of the most notable things included in the film is an interview with Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen in bed together. That piece has been used in numerous films about the couple. Its inclusion here, even though it took place after the band broke up, gives an insight into the band and the issues that drove them apart while at the same time not making note of the influence of Spungen towards that end. Interviews with the leader of the band Johnny Rotten aka John Lydon are nowhere to be seen here, perhaps because he wasn't interested.

Fans of punk music will want to make sure that they include this disc in their collection. The amount of live performance footage by some of the biggest names in the genre makes that worth it in itself. But there is more for those fans to enjoy as well. Included in the extras are a 12 page booklet with liner notes written by John Holmstrom the founding editor of PUNK Magazine, Dead On Arrival: The Punk Documentary That Almost Never Was a feature length documentary about the making of the film, reversible artwork for the sleeve, a 2 sides poster, the original theatrical trailer, a limited edition retro Video Store Style slipcover for the first pressing of the disc and a rare Sex Pistols photo gallery.

If you love punk music then youll want to pick it up. If its not your thing you might find the film a curiosity at best. Of note is that this is the first film as part of MVDs Rewind Collection, a series of films from the golden days of video stores with more to follow. Its nice to see some recognition for those films as well as the businesses that were there in the past offering more than just mainstream movies for fans on their shelves. Heres looking forward to the next release.",1515024000,2,3735,4.397973950795948
8166185,5,B000M4C1II,"Excited to see this coming out. Only saw this once back in the 1980s, ironically rented from a video store in the Islamic State of Brunei of all places. Never seen or found it since. Can't wait. A brilliant snapshot of the time.",1506038400,10,228,4.325581395348837
8166186,5,B000M4C1II,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest punk rock movie ever made. From the interviews with seminal bands i their earliest stages (Generation X, Sex Pistols, X-Ray Spex etc.) to the live coverage of the first Pistols show in America, DOA: A Rite of Passage is thus far the ONLY film to truly capture the feel, spirit and philosophy of the era. A near-comatose Sid Vicious is hilarious, as is the truly terrible, ersatz punk band Terry and The Idiots, whose leader is interviewed about the scene throughout the film. The depictions of a very bleak, ""no future"" England sum it all up as succinctly as the music itself. A treasure that should have been heralded with a DVD release long ago.",1293840000,13,686,4.631147540983607
