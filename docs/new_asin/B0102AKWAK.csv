7304947,1,B0102AKWAK,SPOILER SPOILER ALERT the cover and trailer make it seem like a creature horror but it is only a serial killer movie,1438992000,3,116,4.318181818181818
7304948,1,B0102AKWAK,"If you are watching this because you specifically want to watch a ""Creature Feature"".  Without spoiling a ""twist"" just pass on this one.",1438732800,3,136,4.913043478260869
7304949,1,B0102AKWAK,"I was lured in by the prospects of a good monster movie. Not so. This could have been a good film except for the terrible writing. This concept is good but the writers created characters that were either insane or incredibly stupid. The main characters seem to spend most of the film either screaming at each other or running through the woods screaming in terror. There is not a single character that I liked or could identify with.

Don't waste your time or money.

If you are looking for a good monster movie, try ""Dark was the night"".",1438732800,,538,4.479591836734694
7304950,3,B0102AKWAK,It wasn't what i expected at all. But its true the only true beast is mankind. I wish it would have been a found footage film. I like those for some reason. Thats what i thought it was going to be. But it was a pretty good story.,1438560000,3,229,3.7916666666666665
7304951,2,B0102AKWAK,"Storyline was okay, but the over dramatic constant yelling by Georgia killed it.  In the dark forest where a serial killer lurks, let's yell at each other for 20 minutes.  ""RUN!!!"" I expected to see a T-Rex emerge from behind a tree.  Acting was horrible.  A lot of the scenes that were intended to wow, just didn't make any sense.  Definitely a bait and switch on description.  I was looking forward to seeing an A-pex predator have dinner.",1438473600,3,441,4.589743589743589

7304953,2,B0102AKWAK,For effect it's dark but so dark you have to rely on what you hear because you can't see a thing! I believe the storyline isn't half bad.,1438214400,3,137,3.9285714285714284
7304954,3,B0102AKWAK,Not what the trailer led me to believe. Good movie but wish they would have been more honest about the premise.,1438128000,,111,4.333333333333333
7304955,3,B0102AKWAK,"An American couple (Georgia) and (Matt) go to Exmoor,England to look for a wild animal that is by legend called ""The Beast of Exmoor""

Which in reality is supposed to be a big ravennous member of the cat family that has been mangling and eating sheep in the area. So they set off to try and find it and collect the big reward that's being offered for it's capture.

Along the way they hook up with (Fox) an experienced hunter and set up cameras in a remote section of the Moors. What they find is much more disturbing than any cat! There are some twists and suprises that arise that make for interesting viewing .

There is some nice camera work and cinematography but there is quite a bit of night footage and  although It adds to the creep factor it also makes it hard to see certain things .At times they use some of the camera  monitors as a source of night vision lighting and it's a nice effect. The acting is one of it's strongest assets and makes it easy for the movie to play it straight all the way through.

There isn't much gore ,just depictions of violence ,disturbing images and a couple of bloody scenes. The third act is really exciting and gives us some great cat and mouse action and some very tense situations.",1438041600,8,1229,4.344978165938865

15 minutes and I had enough, unlikable characters, unlikely situations, stupid behaviour - in the bin waste of money.
I now find out that though it was called XMoor and supposedly set in Devon it was filmed in northern Ireland - says it all really.

7304984,3,B0102AKWAK,"When you learn of the legend of a previously unknown cryptid, I suppose a film is not all bad. In fact, the 2014 film ""The Beast of X Moor"" is occasionally good with a twist that will keep you entertained. This low-budget horror is aided by terrific on-location filming in Belfast, Ireland. This film evolves into a derivative beast, borrowing far too much from better genre films, but sometimes location is everything.

A youthful American couple (Melia Kreiling, Nick Blood) enjoys traveling the globe as pseudoscientists to track down cryptids, and they arrive in Ireland with the hopes of discovering the beast of Exmoor. Based on actual folklore, for decades English residents claim a hybrid of the puma lives in hiding in the moorland, killing livestock in the dead of night. Photographs of the creature from afar - they are always from afar and always out of focus - appear to show a grainy black cat about the size of a tiger, though it could also be a lounging Bigfoot.

They hire a salt-of-the-earth tracker appropriately named Fox (Mark Bonnar), who would absolutely give Quint (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws/dp/B007STBUHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws</a>) a run for his money. Unshaven, grumpy and adorned in a leather jacket, Fox leads the feckless duo into the moors at dusk, checking for tracks while squinting his eyes at the foreboding horizon. Will they strike gold and find the hissing beast? Or will they come up as empty-handed as Les Stroud during his ill-advised&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survivorman-Season-6/dp/B00VK2UQ6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survivorman Season 6</a>&nbsp;search for the Sasquatch? Well, if they find nothing, there's not much of a movie now is there?

I'll be the first to admit what they eventually discover caught me completely off guard. The story then spun into unexpected directions with its share of thrills. The film was written and directed by Luke Hyams, a determined lass who cut his teeth in British TV. He has a knack for atmosphere, even if the film did not play out as well as it could have. Once you show the menace, the fear is dramatically decreased. I also thought the conclusion was too frantic and implausible for its own good. Subtlety takes you a long way, and it's a shame Hyams couldn't keep the expedition on track.

It's interesting that even bad British B-films are superior to American works of the same ilk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anaconda-Blu-ray/dp/B00K31RC52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anaconda [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Mountain/dp/B000JYW5UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch Mountain</a>). The dialogue is sharp and the performances strong. And the incredible on-location filming in Ireland is captivating. ""The Beast of X Moor"" is monumentally silly but, like the elusive cat of cryptid legend, it's not stupid.",1444694400,4,3017,5.928735632183908

The story line was dull and it is a SLASHER type of movie! So don't watch this movie with the hopes of it being original, it's the same plot that every murder film seems to go with!!",1444176000,,357,4.042253521126761
7304986,1,B0102AKWAK,"I am a huge cryptic and paranormal fan, so I've been tracking down and watching some films on creatures that I am familiar with. Lately I've been tricked into watching movies like this one where a creature is on the cover and even on the trailer, and yet it never appears on screen. People like to say it is a good twist, but I feel like if I've been getting the carpet pulled from right under me. And that pisses me off! If I would have known that it was gonna be another mediocre serial killer thriller I would have totally passed on this garbage. I saw the movie until the end, and I was pretty upset by that point, but imagine my frustration when in the last scene the ""Beast of Xmoor"" or panther like creature shows his face on a motion detection camera set up in the woods! I lost my mind! It was as if the director kicked me in the junk and laughed in my face for watching his stupid movie! Please, no more false creature feature movies. It either is or it isn't! And please no found footage films too! Those are crap as well!",1443916800,,1033,4.17
7304987,1,B0102AKWAK,No beast here. Just a terrible story with unlikeable characters. 90 minutes wasted.,1442275200,,83,5.461538461538462
7304988,2,B0102AKWAK,"Georgia (Melia Kreiling) is an undiscovered creature hunter. Matt (Nick Blood) carries the equipment. She wants to hunt a large cat that has been killing animals on Xmoor and there exists the fuzzy picture. She has hired as a guide a man named Fox (Mark Bonnar) who comes across as mentally unstable. When they get deep into the Xmoor, it turns out that Fox has a slightly different plan as their trust in him diminish and they discover there is more out there in the Xmoor they need to worry about other than a big cat.

The film starts out as a typical film that one might expect from the hand held genre. Then everything happens at night. The film took several twists which could have made it more interesting, but didn't.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.

Plot Spoiler. The opening scene of a girl running in the Xmoor wearing fishnets had me scratching my head as I considered this a cheap ploy by the director. It was actually a clever clue. I only wish the film has measured up.",1441756800,2,984,4.455555555555556
7304989,5,B0102AKWAK,"This has been in my queue awhile, but the cover art turned me off for some reason. Looks a bit cheesy. But the film itself was a nice little find.

You know the plot by now and I don't want to give away any spoilers. Suffice it to say that it had some twists that really took us by surprise and kept us glued to the screen. A pretty novel plot, imho, nothing that I've personally seen before, and there were lots of outcomes that you could try to guess. We weren't right on any of them :) (which is rare).

The cast was ok, but the sound was kind of funky. In the beginning half hour it sounded like the actors were dubbed. That was a turnoff but we got used to it, and the sound improved, about 20 minutes in.

There's a bit of rambling in the first half hour, but once the action starts it goes fast and doesn't stop. Highly recommended for a fun horror movie night.",1441497600,2,868,4.064327485380117
7304990,1,B0102AKWAK,"This movie is a carnival of mediocrity.  Not a single character makes a single rational choice the entire movie.  Don't get me wrong, the acting is good, as well as the cinematography, but every character, without exception, is so stupid, so blind to any suggestion of a more practical course of action, it strains credulity.  It is like watching someone fall on their sword, not because they are bound by honor, but because they are careless.  Just dumb.  Plain, old fashioned, unadorned dumbness.  Stupidity.  Yeah.",1441497600,,517,5.011764705882353

7304994,4,B0102AKWAK,I thought this was a really good surprise of a movie.  A couple from America are looking for a mythical creature that lives on the moors.  They'll document what they find.  A guide/tracker is brought along to help them.  Only he has a hidden agenda.  All three end up finding out that not everything is as it seems.  Something else is hunting on the moors.

7304995,4,B0102AKWAK,"Although I enjoy the ""found footage"" type of films it was refreshing that this is NOT one of those. I really enjoyed this film and the roller coaster ride it took me on. At first I thought ""oh no not another carnage in the woods movie"" but I quickly learned it was far from it. I don't want to ruin it for anyone so I'll just say that the writer throws a plot twist at you that you sure as hell won't see coming. It took the film in whole new direction. The acting was in the A+ category and really helps pull you in to the story, hence the title of this review. During my rental period I watched it a second time which I don't normally do with this type of movie since the jump scares have little effect the second time through, but this one mostly works on a second go round.
