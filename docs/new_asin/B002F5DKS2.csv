8368801,5,B002F5DKS2,This recording is a wonderful cross section of the music of the 1960s.  Music from one's youth brings back a million memories.  This is one recording no boomer should be without.  Highly recommended.,1499385600,,199,4.96969696969697
8368802,5,B002F5DKS2,"Loved this DVD with Ron Dante, and Jackie De Shannon coming off best. Ron sang his great Sugar, Sugar superbly. Jackie did Put A Little Love In Your Heart, nicely, and What The World Needs Now Is Love, her best song. Originally on PBS this is a fun DVD to own.",1369526400,2,260,4.117647058823529

8368804,4,B002F5DKS2,"This show is part of the My Music series which has been playing on PBS since the late 90s.  It's not the best of these shows but appears to be the last original show they've put out.  There are several solid performances, some of which were taken from other shows (such as Roger McGuinn), which seems to be happening more and more as the years go on.  I still enjoyed it as a whole, although Vanilla Fudge and Iron Butterfly do absolutely nothing for me.  My favorite performance was Bobby Boris Pickett doing Monster Mash, which is on the bonus section of the DVD.  If you enjoy the music of the 60s, you will enjoy this show.
