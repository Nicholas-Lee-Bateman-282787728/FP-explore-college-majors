1900358,4,B0000A02U8,"I'm into time travel movies and thought this wouldbe another good one.  It is but targeted for the 12-15 (or so) age group, but that's okay I still enjoyed it. The downside to this purchase was (and wasn't all that bad) was that there was no coverart - oh well.  Get this movie for your kids.",1351987200,,292,4.196428571428571

1900361,4,B0000A02U8,"This movie kept my kids entertained.  They are 9,7,and 4.  It was a great movie that the kids could watch and i didn't have to worry about the content.  It had both my daugters and sons engrossed with the 4 four wheelers and the horses and how the kids put peanut butter on things.  They thought that was funny.  It's a good movie that you should buy.",1221696000,5,351,4.17910447761194
1900362,5,B0000A02U8,"OK - I got a little bored after watching the movie for the 17th time, but my kids (ages 7 - 12) thoroughly enjoy it EVERY time.  Lots of fun for them... and the adults, too.  It's a clean movie with good moral messages.  Highly recommended.",1207353600,7,240,4.173913043478261
1900363,2,B0000A02U8,"Colorado's San Juan Mountains from Durango to Silverton to Ouray is my

favorite place to vacation in the USA.  So when I saw the preview of

Durango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix.  It is

one of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, while

cute, outsmart all the stupid adults.  The first 30 minutes showed some

nice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that's

why I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to save

Ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore,

intended for young and undemanding children.  Don't bother unless you

love Durango as much as I do.",1176336000,,673,4.508333333333334
1900364,1,B0000A02U8,"The dynamic Root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children's comedy.  My advice to Root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash.  The only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child Curtis.  Big props to my man for his preformance.  Hope to see you in more movies to come.

p.s. I think Taylor Root is still a virgin.",1124064000,,373,4.3478260869565215

7995071,3,B0000A02U8,"Cute for the age group of the kids involved in the movie - fun concept.  A bit hokey in some places for adults, even those (like me) who enjoy this type of movie.  It's worth what I paid for it, probably won't watch it again, but will give it to my young teenage and grammar school age grandkids.  Was particularly enjoyable where happenings and scenes took place in areas I've been over the year.  Appreciated it not trying to sexualize any character and keeping the kids within the realm of good clean fun.",1408406400,,508,4.43010752688172
