8044835,1,B000767R8A,This DVD does not work on American DVD players so it is of no use to me.  It will cost me more to return it than I paid for it so I guess I am stuck.  I didn't see anywhere a notice that it was not a local disc.  I don't know if the seller even knew.,1467158400,,250,3.3508771929824563
