7904984,5,B000006QYY,"This video production - Joan of Arc: Soul on Fire (from A&E's In Search of History Series) - is, in my opinion, is one of A&E's best. It has been aried on the History Channel and is 50 minutes in length. As far  as documentary-style video productions go, this one is probably my  favorite. The filming and photographic arangement is good (which includes  some great shots of paintings of Joan of Arc and also some acted sequences  that serve to add color, emotion and excitement to the production), the  music is good (well suited for this documentary), and the information is  well presented.  Guest appearances include that of female historian (the  late) Regine Pernound (who has also written some fantastic books on the  life of Joan of Arc).  This is a great introductory video to the life of  Joan of Arc.  If you have already seen A&E's Biography series on Joan  of Arc (or have yet to see it) this video is a must-add to your collection!  Keep in mind: this is a documentary, not a Hollywood movie, but it is a  very well produced video.  Recommended viewing, appropriate for the whole  family.  Kick the lights off, grab some popcorn and check out this cool  presentation.",951782400,18,1181,4.645631067961165
