8518114,4,B007IXS7R0,"Plot: Virtual Computer Generated building of the Lower Fuhrer-Bunker~1943-1945.

The last place Hitler Lived. And where he died.  1943 and the Brits have a very successful air raid on Berlin. With complete Allied mastery of the skies over Germany,  Der Fuhrer Hitler decides he needs an even better and deeper bunker.  He helps design the plans with a few idea of his own. There are few photos or plans of the Lower Bunker so much of the plans are based on ""measurements"" taken from the actual bunker by the East German Secret Police AND Personal accounts by the last living occupants of the Bunker. This is Completely done with a Virtual Tour and how they built it. You will love it or hate it depending on how much you like history. This is well done. The narrator IS German and speaks very good English. Choice of language narration is English or German. This starts with the demolition of part of the Winter Garden and adding an even deeper and bigger BUNKER that Hitler ""hopes"" will keep him safe from the Bigger Bombs dropping on Germany at this phase in the War. Construction began in late 1943 and goes into 1944. Included are the general lay out of the rooms and purposes, air locks and ventilation shafts. Added is the highest grade of cement in density and added combo of steal beams and iron beams that help ""reinforce"" the ultimate safe bunker for Hitler inside Berlin. Interesting if you like World War 2 history. I give it 4 STARS~",1488585600,,1446,4.593023255813954

8518118,4,B007IXS7R0,"I give four stars because the virtual reconstruction of the Fuhrer bunker is just great. The commentary is also very informative on the subject. However, I deplore the fact that we have to pay twenty bucks for a DVD who doesn't last even an hour. Part one (1935-1942) and Part two (1943) should have been included in the same DVD. I suspect Christof Neubauer used a market trick just to make more money out of it. Another sad thing is the fact that the interior of Hitler's bunker was not detailed like the Vorbunker from Part one.",1435104000,,531,4.484536082474227

8518120,4,B007IXS7R0,"I've already written a reasonably comprehensive review of the first dvd in this series, The Fuehrer Bunker 1935-1942: A Virtual Reconstruction, so there's no point rehashing it all again here.
This second dvd covers the modifications and extensions that were made to the bunker in 1943, when the Vorbunker was extended to create a second bunker.
The second bunker was constructed at a lower level than the first, hence the name Tiefbunker, (deep bunker), which has since become better known as the Fuhrerbunker.
Both the visuals and the information provided in the narration are of the same exceptionally high standard as those in the first dvd.
The only reason I have marked it down one star is because unlike the first dvd there is no virtual tour, which is a shame because let's face it most people would be more interested in looking around the Tiefbunker where Hitler spent his final days than they would the Vorbunker.",1370131200,12,924,4.89171974522293
