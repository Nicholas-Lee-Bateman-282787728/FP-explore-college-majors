1830220,5,B0000897A6,I saw this when it aired on Cinemax and was blown away.  I can't believe anyone was brave or crazy enough to take on this assignment but I'm glad they did.,1048118400,,155,4.0
1830221,5,B0000897A6,"This documentary was aired in november on cinemax probally 3 times. What a shame. Every american, no matter what thier stance with iraq, should watch this. It totally changed my mind. It is a complete documentary of the man. It is a shame that men had to die in order for this to be made. That's right: people died in order for you to be able to see it. I won't tell you what my stance is, and the reason why is that you owe it to yourself to find out how you feel given this rare glance into his world. I've read 3 biographies of the man over the years, and this is a good documentary.",1047427200,30,586,4.017094017094017
1830241,5,B0000897A6,"Saddam Hussein was a vicious, heartless dictator. This video looks at him and shows the pre-liberation nature of ruthless dictatorship, the cult of personality that surrounded the man and the waste of his lifestyle... the palaces built while his people starved, the gold-plated guns (I saw several of these in the Special Forces Museum) and the endless paintings and other depictions. When I left Iraq in 2005 you could still come across some of these ""heroic billboards"" of Saddam and GIs bought leftover paintings of the dictator at local suqs.

Definitely a keeper.",1196380800,,568,5.10752688172043
1830242,5,B0000897A6,"I repeat, to the naysayers:

While attempting and succeeding to sound smart your review is rubbish. For on thing, this film wasn't supposed to be a documentary per se, it's a French guy who went to Iraq with the pretense of showing what sanctions had been doing to Iraq, only to solidify in his mind that there was plenty of money to go around and the more that Iraqi people suffered, the more Saddam's regime gained sympathy, and it almost worked. You didn't like the film because it didn't make the West look bad. You cite opinions from liberal news sources who want to blame the USA for Saddam and his chemical weapons. The fact is, it was European companies, to include Sweden, who supplied Iraq with said materials not the US govt. Joel Soler could have been far harsher in Saddam but wasn't. Listen to his interview at the end of the DVD, he is lucky he wasn't killed. But yes, there are other things he forgot to mention (because they hadn't happened yet) like the fact that the UN, which he claims is a great organization, was being bribed by Saddam, more specifically, bribes were being taken by countries that all of a sudden reneged on their word to Powell that they would go along with enforcing the umpteen billionth resolution. As stated before, thousands if not millions of Iraqis died because of the UN sanctions. Duelfer's report clearly stated Saddam had every intention of gathering world sympathy to get the sanctions lifted and once they were he planned on building back up his arsenal, to include nuclear. Despite Jow Wilson, Saddam did in fact look into yellow cake from Niger and he sought and received aid from N. korea as well. So to look at the current peacekeeping/rebuilding war in Iraq in retrosepct: if so many Iraqi kids were dying due to sanctions, as tragic as it is, the UN sanctions are now lifted and people are dying to an equal or lesser extent. The real bad guys here are AQ, non-Iraqi terrorists who are trying to take over Iraq as their own ever since Afghanistan was taken from them; they are doing the killing now. At least they are lining up to get shot down like fish in a barrel there and not on US soil. The UN failed to uphold its responsibility and was sidestepped, and if Saddam didn't have any weapons, his bluff was called and good riddance. The surge is working, yet you won't here that from your local news channel.",1193443200,4,2370,4.537383177570093
1830243,5,B0000897A6,"Like many people, I'm frusterated with the way the Iraq war has gone, so even though this documentary seems datad because Saddam is long out of power, it did me good to see this comprehensive review of the evil that was removed from the planet.

This documentary is everything a documentary should be.  Well narrated, fast paced, filled with information, and organized.  It begins with some funny stuff and then gets into the serious evil of the Saddam regime.  There's a lot of file footage that most viewers have likely never seen before, interspersed with interviews (way more fun than interviews interspersed with file footage).  It's got a great soundrack too!

Finally, be sure to watch the interview where the creator explains the risks he took to make this film.  Or maybe, watch this first, then the documentary itself.",1192665600,,828,4.913669064748201
1830244,4,B0000897A6,"Watch the interview with the director at the end.  Taken together, this is one of the films that struck me both on my ironic funny bone and also informationally and emotionally.  Humor and tragedy do go together -- to protect us from the ravaging impact of tragedy.  The black irony in Solzhenitsyn's 'The Gulag Archipelago' allowed me to keep reading accounts of absolute horror.  Uncle Saddam keeps me laughing and helps me not to go into the depths of despondency, but it sends its message across nonetheless!  And afterwards, when directer Joel Soder tells his personal tale of the production, and of the people that he interviewed who were killed after he left, the reality of what was happening hit me all the more.

I will have to see Barbet Schroeder's ""Idi Amin: A Self Portrait"" (which on Netflix is called ""General Idi Amin Dada,"" to make a comparison and see if the two films were even supposed to be similar!  But I, having grown up in the Middle East, had never seen or heard of everything that Joel Soder put into his documentary, and I thought the presentation was what documentaries need to be:  fast, witty, and NOT boring.  Because this sort of stuff matters immensely: it is all exceedingly interesting at some point, and the presentation needs to deliver the interest to its target audience.

The documentary combined with the Directors Interview: 4 stars.",1168387200,,1377,4.796610169491525
1830245,5,B0000897A6,Uncle Saddam is a great documentary of the dictator Saddam and his terrible regime.  It's funny and so true! I love the film,1128816000,2,124,4.391304347826087
1830246,3,B0000897A6,I say they should sodomize this guy with pork sausage links before sending him to his reward.,1104451200,2,93,4.529411764705882
1830247,1,B0000897A6,"This documentary is bad on so many different levels that it's difficult to know where to begin. ""Uncle Saddam"" is directed like a particularly egregious episode of ""Hard Copy,"" or some other tabloid news program. The writing is simply inept: sarcastic, but not funny. In fact, no part of this documentary is remotely original. It reveals no information that hasn't already been known for years. (Surprisingly, many of Saddam's stranger idiosyncrasies are not even mentioned.) The historical overview is superficial in the extreme; the film seems to gather footage of Saddam that is already widely available; and finally, while an irreverent approach to the subject matter might be appropriate for a documentarian like Morgan Spurlock investigating the fast food industry (""Super Size Me""), such an approach seems pretty callous in a film about a murderous dictator.

The director fails in his obvious attempt to replicate Barbet Schroeder's brilliant, ""Idi Amin: A Self-Portrait."" Even if Soler could have secured the kind of access enjoyed by Schroeder, the sheer incompetence demonstrated by this embarrassing film makes it seem unlikely that ""Uncle Saddam"" would have ever lived up to the challenge. ""Idi Amin: A Self-Portrait"" is a cinematic masterpiece: a documentary that explores the chasm between the decorated military dictator and the human misery he causes, an inquiry into the personal psychology of those who crave political power, and, finally, a portrait of a deluded, narcissistic, sociopath. ""Uncle Saddam"" resembles a poorly constructed, sensationalized, dumbed-down ""A&E""-style documentary about Saddam and his family.

It should go without saying that Soler makes every effort to excise those portions of history that are currently regarded as unacceptable -- those irritating facts that crop up, every so often, in the middle of articles that appear on page A19 of the NYT or Washington Post. Those interested in the history of Saddam's curious relationship with the West, as well as the eccentricities that appear to be the source of so much amusement for the other reviewers, should check out Said K. Aburish's ""Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge"": basically, a case study in hypocrisy.

1830248,5,B0000897A6,"Undoubtedly the strangest documentary I've ever seen, the footage of Saddam  is more like watching a comedian do a ""dictator skit"" in the manner of Charlie Chaplin's Hitler, than an actual human being. In an array of ill-fitting hats, we see Saddam at rest, at play, and having lots of fun dancing. He looks totally insane, and most likely on some serious ""medication"". It also goes through the family tree, some of whom we are familiar with because they have graced the famous ""deck of cards"". Son Uday obviously either had the same genetic madness, and/or the same chemist.

French filmmaker Joel Soler risked his life to get this footage. Using the subterfuge of making a documentary on Iraqi architecture, he gained rare access into many areas not normally shown to anyone with a camera. We do get to see the many astounding, grandiose palaces, which he contrasts with the filthy conditions in the Children's Hospital, where the flies are fat, and the children skeletal.

One of the more bizarre sections is the ""Saddam Art Center"", which contains nothing but wall-to-wall portraits of the Evil Madman, and all the tours are led by glassy-eyed fawning subjects, full of praise for their fearless leader, and who would dutifully kiss him in his preferred spot, his armpits, which brings about Saddam's lecture on hygiene and body odors. One has to wonder how anyone retained their sanity surviving decades of this man's iron-fisted rule, and how those born under it, who have known nothing else, can learn to live in the real world.

Interspersed throughout are flashes of the true horror behind this veil of Saddam's happy Iraq, and commentary by exiled Iraqis of their experiences.

The musical choices for the soundtrack are excellent, and if you like Arabic music as I do, you'll find the score enjoyable.

This is a riveting documentary, totally unique in its presentation. A true-life black comedy, and a rare piece of filmmaking. Total running time is approximately 63 minutes.",1100304000,10,1987,4.969879518072289
1830249,4,B0000897A6,"This is a remarkable documentary to watch, especially since I watched it the night before Saddam was captured.  This was definitely one of the most egotistical dictators on the face of the planet, focused largely of himself and little on anyone else.  It is this reason that dictators of this sort loathe listening to different points of view; to them, it is a sign of weakness to admit that they are wrong.  They hide in caves or a rat hole, in the case of Saddam Hussein.
Saddam Hussein is no different than any other dictator: larger than life when in power, nothing but a meek, self-seeking flaterrer in captivity.  A brutal, ruthless man.  Yet this documentary is certainly not the best portray of what happened, nor is it of high quality.  Still, it is a start.
It was rather odd to watch as they interviewed people such as the woman running the Saddam Hussein art musuem.  You could tell that she was tired of seeing Saddam's face everywhere, but couldn't freely state that she was tired of him.  This documentary certainly shows what it is like to live in an unfree state and have everyone meekly agreeing with the ruthless dictator, even though, deep down, they deeply disagreed with his idiotic policies.

7980208,5,B0000897A6,"This wonderous tapestry of a documentary chronicles a simpler time in Iraq.  A time when Saddam Hussein wasn't ravaged by the American devil for supposedly possessing imaginary yellowcake uranium.  A time when the great benevolent leader bestowed the wisdom upon his female citizens that they should take two showers for each taken by their male counterparts.  How different it is now (P. U. stinky!!!).  This documentary shows how he really cared about the people - he melted down all of their gold into a gold carriage for the benefit of the entire country.  No country needs a few gold knick-knacks when they can pool them into one really cool gold object - a carriage!!!!  He was ahead of his time, we in America had to wait for the likes of Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders to see this kind of progression!  Anyway, I'm glad the filmmakers didn't try to make Saddam look bad like all the news and Bush's did.  Those same people are the ones who showed Gadhafi getting poked in the butt!!!  On the news!  For children to see!  I only like positive news stories like dogs with fake legs and special needs kids that raise a bunch of money running milk stands in the summer.  It's tragic when jealousy over a thick mustache makes people so jealous they ruin your life.  It's just like Taylor Swift said when she sang about Saddam ""the haters gonna hate, hate, hate"".  How flattering to have Taylor Swift crush on you like that - way to go Saddam!",1468368000,,1446,4.575875486381323

7980210,4,B0000897A6,"A very revealing look at how the vile and mass murdering dictator built massive monuments and palaces all around Iraq and lived the most lavish life of self-aggrandizement imaginable while his people suffered and starved. Contrasted with his obscene palaces and the rebuilt Babylon with each stone bearing Saddam's name is the Children's hospital in Baghdad with its death and horrifying and filthy conditions.
Proves contrary to Saddam's and his apologists in the Wests propaganda that there was a surplus of money to go around that could have fed every child in Iraq and given them the best care but was instead spent on Saddam's insane schemes of self-glorification.
Begins with tracing Saddam;s childhood and youth. He was taught by his uncle that there were three thing God should not have created : Jews, Persians and flies
After becoming President in 1979 he re instituted public hangings of Iraqi Jews , and gassed hundreds of thousands of Kurds and Marsh Arabs as well as pressing ahead with the Iran-Iraq War.
The second half of the film documents his control of his cronies and family, using fear and millions of dollars.
Saddam was in the process of building weapons of mass destruction when he was overthrown by the allied forces in 2003. He was a mass murderer and tyrant who would have killed millions more had he not been removed. Whether the WMDs were found or not were irrelevant and most absurd is the claim that the war against Saddam was launched by America for oil!",1382918400,,1487,4.8352941176470585

7980213,1,B0000897A6,"Poorly made anti-Saddam Hussein propaganda film. It's not that the guy is lovable or anything, but the film plays fast and loose with the truth, takes quotes and film clips out of context and demeans the history of Iraq and the Arab culture. The narration and on screen titles are amateurish. And the film tone changes from silly to brutal and back again several times. I would recommend reading a book about the region, Saddam's regime, the initial US support for it, the Gulf War, the Iraq war, etc., rather this watching this piece of junk.",1275177600,,543,4.666666666666667
7980214,3,B0000897A6,I ordered this about a month ago and sent the 1st one back because the sound quality of the interview with the Director was terrible.  I had to turn the volume up to max and try to listen over a white noise sound.  The 2nd REPLACEMENT tape that they sent me had exactly the same problem.  I am very irritated as the company sending out the new DVD did not check that the same flaw was not on the Replacement tape.  I wonder what I will do as the company clearly does not care and this could happen again and again.  I quite liked the DVD but the interview is important as it tell what the Director had to go through to get the footage that he shows.,1268179200,,649,4.0390625
7980215,3,B0000897A6,"ground, & managed to really piss off the Bush administration-twice. Nepotism run amuck. It seems that every friend & shirttail relative got a government job from Saddam, or somehow got their snouts in the public trough of Iraq. He also killed a lot of them when his paranoia got the best of him. This documentry manages, thru sometimes strained humor to trace the the history of Saddam Hussein, his career & sucess in seizing & pillaging Iraq. He also transformed Iraq into a culture of his image. His maniac ego made him a near-god. His picture was on the front page of newspapers every day. The movie ended before his final chapter which was execution. As good as the movie was which, become tedious at times, better was a dvd extra. Sort of a rogue's gallery of modern dictators such as Hitler, Stalin, Castro etc. with a brief humorous synopsis on each. Mel Brooks once indicated that one of his purposes in lfe was to ridicule Adolf Hitler every chance he got. One example of this was the faux musical & showtune,
 ""Springtime for Hitler"".
  As historians, we acknowledge these poor excuses for humanity for what they were. We know the damage to mankind & the the atocities they've committed. Much of that can never be undone. We may feel helpless as we condemn them. Let's turn instead to merciless ridicule. Their less than human characteristics, personal inadaquacies & impotence. Do it to the point than nobody with a shred of intelligence can ever admire them. In fact, I think there is very little support in most of the countries they oppressed. How many except a lunatic fringe rever Hitler or Idi Amin or Mussolini? Does Castro actually believe he will be celebrated after he & brother Raoul leave the scene? Even revered tyrants like Lenin & Mao are slowly drifting into the dumpster of history.",1249603200,,1810,4.7215189873417724
