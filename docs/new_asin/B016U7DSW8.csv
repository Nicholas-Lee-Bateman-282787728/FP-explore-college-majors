8737273,5,B016U7DSW8,"I received a free copy of this movie for my honest review.

The Reconciler is a great movie that kept my interest from moment one. It was cool how some of the stories connected and the music gosh it made you really think that you were watching truly a scary movie. The ending was unexpected. I totally did not see it coming.

At a time when there is a lot of hate, fear, and uncertainty in the world, this movie was a refreshing addition to our summer! I watched the movie with my teen children and we discussed the importance of forgiveness, trust grace, and mercy. One afternoon of watching this movie proved to be critical to their lives as they are often faced with the decision of whether or not to reconcile with someone they care about.",1468368000,,491,4.466666666666667
