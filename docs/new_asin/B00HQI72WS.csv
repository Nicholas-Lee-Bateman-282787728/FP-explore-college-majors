8634277,5,B00HQI72WS,"In a world where magic and mundanes co-exist, Haruhi watches a young boy help her from bullies and decides to follow the path of the mage.  Now years later on Valentines day she meets a young man named Yuna who looks like the boy she saw years ago, but he says he does not like magic.  But when the Magic section of the school explodes mysteriously, she and her friend Anri transfer to the mundane section and meets Yuna, Hachisuke (a total letch), and Jun (a pretty girl who isn;t) and learn while the Magic section is rebuilt.  Can these two groups of students learn to co-exist without someone being turned into a frog, can Haruhi find the boy she so desperately wants to meet, and is Yuna the one, and can we figure out WHY Jun prefers the girl uniform over the guys?

This was a good series.  It works more on the characters and story than fan service, while not unique in the story, it still has a refreshing feel over the series of Ecchi shows lately.  Give it a shot and now I am off to watch Familiar of Zero.",1397088000,5,1018,4.248704663212435
