3881135,4,B0029WLJFC,"Over the years, I have seen many productions of this magical musical tour de force by the incomparable Gilbert & Sullivan. This production is one of the best. The performers were uniformly strong, with special kudos to Mabel, and the Major General. The Pirate King, although the performance was strong, was a little too Johhny Depp look-alike-sound-alike for my taste. While it is certainly a comic role, this show is not the Pirates of the Caribbean and the imitation of a popular movie screen character, although effective with the audience, was a little too flamboyant for me.
That said, the show was very well sung and very well acted; the sets were effective; and the orchestra excellent. Excellent show!",1245628800,7,709,4.966386554621849
3881136,5,B0029WLJFC,"I haven't seen the Blu-ray version of this but greatly enjoy the standard DVD version. The Blu-ray is filmed in high def - not made from an inferior conversion of a standard into a high def master, which can never be true high-def - so I am anticipating a super experience. All the Opera Australia G&S have very high quality audio and video; and the performers are of the very highest standard. Seems somehow that G&S should come very naturally to the Aussies.

To diss an unseen film (see review below) because it's not the one you thought is absurd. That's like hating it because it was damaged in the mail; I've seen THAT used as a reason for a  one-star review before.",1242864000,10,672,4.455284552845528
3881137,5,B0029WLJFC,"This is a wonderful production and is the best dvd ever, in my opinion, of Pirates of Penzance, starring award winning Anthony Warlow and La Boheme star David Hobson. I suggest you rent this from Netflix before you offer such outlandish statements. Please,try again.

My only criticism is that the description of the disc indicates that it will NOT have the optional sub-titles. The Australian and British regional dvds have the optional sub-titles which are ESSENTIAL to the understanding and enjoyment of Gilbert and Sullivan. Even though they speak the King's English on this disc,I still have trouble understanding some of the lyrics. Trust me on that.

Gilbert is considered by the British and many scholars to be a great poet and his words contribute to at least half of the enjoyment of the show. That being said, I can hardly wait to get the blu-ray disc.",1242864000,14,863,4.863945578231292
3881138,1,B0029WLJFC,"Wrong one.  Still waiting on the Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt, and George Rose version.  My only copy is on LD.  Guess I'll have to burn my own DVD as MCA seems reluctant to issue it on BluRay or DVD.  Too bad.",1242518400,,226,4.186046511627907
8358324,5,B0029WLJFC,"This is just great fun.  And this Blu-Ray features a top-notch cast.  If you like G&S and want the great visual fidelity and sound of Blu-Ray, here you are!",1433203200,,156,4.344827586206897
8358325,2,B0029WLJFC,"This seems to be (have been) a delightful and wonderful performance of one of G&Ss best.  Unfortunately, the video-director (Brian Best - where is the once-ubiquitous Brian Large when you need him!) was so intent on creating his own version of the show with extreme close-ups and early-MTV-like montage that we don't get to see most of what the director (Stuart Maunder) and choreographer/assistant director (Elizabeth Hill) created.  The frenetic changes of images were dizzying, even vertiginous.  In the opening number, Pour, o pour the pirate sherry, there were 36 camera changes in the 60 seconds from the first sung word to the end of the song.  For Oh better far to live and die (For I am a Pirate King), there were 42 camera changes in the 80 seconds it took to sing the first verse.  And in With cat-like tread, there were 34 camera changes in the 63 seconds it took to sing the first verse. Fleeting glimpses in all three of these numbers told us that we were missing some wonderful choreography.
  TV producer-video-directors, like film composers, should strive to enhance the creation of the original creative team without being noticed themselves; here, you notice hardly anything but the TV producer-video-director.
  I would suggest that stage directors put a clause in their contracts giving them control over the DVD content of their productions.  Directors have already used their compositional skills to direct our attention to where it should be, to what they want us to see; why do TV producer-video-directors subvert that and feel the need to create different visuals and focus?  I do love occasional close-ups and the variety of a different angle; but what I really want the TV producer-video-director to give me is the best seat in the house, even if that mythical-ideal seat may change from scene to scene.  But I want to see what the creative team - librettist, composer, director, conductor, choreographer, costumer, set designer, lighting designer - have already created.  And that is what Brian Large did so masterfully, perhaps because he was also a stage director and musician himself.  What I especially don't want is a TV producer-video-director who hides with his/her montage what the creative team has already put on the stage; and that is what happens here.  I will give just a couple of examples.
  During the chorus sections of I am the very model of a modern Major-General, the chorus has been given what fleeting glimpses seem to indicate  is very clever and funny choreography; instead we are given irrelevant and extreme close-ups of individual characters.  When the foeman bares his steel is one of the wittiest parodies in all of Gilbert And Sullivan - a ritorna vincitor gone awry.  As the policemen try to muster their courage to fight the pirates by singing of the trumpets martial sound, the Major-Generals daughters (wards)  try to send them off with valedictions of go, ye heroes, go to glory! Though you die in combat gory...Go to death, and go to slaughter...Go ye heroes, go and die!...Go to glory and the grave!  The men, understandably, become somewhat unenthusiastic about the impending confrontation with the pirates.  Sullivans overlapping of the two sentiments in a brilliant tutti chorus, with Major-General Stanleys interjections that the men say they are going but they don't go, is one of the comic highlights of all G&S.  And when staged brilliantly, it can be one of the most hilarious and unforgettable moments in theater.  And it may have been in this production; but we in video-land will never know.  Once again, the fleeting glimpses we are given of the staging indicate that it may have been brilliant; instead we are given irrelevant and constantly changing close-ups.  When the song ended I felt nothing but frustration at having missed what the director and choreographer/assistant director had intended me to see.
  There are numerous other instances of this frustration: When a felons not engaged in his employment; With cat-like tread, upon our prey we steal; Sighing softly to the river; and the Poor wandring ones Finale.  All are marred by extreme, irrelevant close-ups instead of mid-level shots which would have allowed us to see the staging we were meant to see.  In G&S, everyone is a straight-(wo)man for everyone else; reactions are essential to the humor.  Pirates is truly an ensemble piece, and we are meant to see the reactions of the ensemble  and not just a close-up of the person singing or speaking.
  All of which is to say that we missed seeing a great deal on this DVD, which is a great pity because the actors/singers in this ensemble give excellent performances.  The entire production is suffused with joy - just watch the curtain call!  There are even some exceptional performances: Richard Alexander as the Sergeant of Police and Anthony Warlow as the Pirate King are simply amazing - even W.S. would be pleased that his words emerged through Sir Arthurs music to reveal the comic genius of them both - ambiguity intended!",1407888000,2,5024,4.959378733572282
8358326,4,B0029WLJFC,"Good production. Especially Act II.  Well acted, well sang and fresh feeling.

This production takes the mid-road between the traditional and the modern.  Somewhat like the Papp version but without the apologetic or campy touches.  And having it in Blu Ray with all that means for sound and picture makes it an especial winner.

Highly recommended!",1385683200,,348,5.142857142857143
8358327,5,B0029WLJFC,"If you love Gibert and Sulivan, you will love these productions by Opera Australia.  They do an excellent job.  This is one I will watch over and over.",1358985600,,151,4.357142857142857
8358328,4,B0029WLJFC,"This was AMAZING! I love it!  The best Pirates of Penzance performance I've seen yet.  Yes, I am even rating it above the Jon English, Simon Gallagher production from the 80's.  The voices are ALL top class, the sets are simple yet effective, and changing of the sets does not distract from the performance.  What I especially liked was the acting.  There didn't seem to be any 'emptiness', where the singer at the time is just singing into 'space' for the sake of getting through the song, which so often happens on stage in a musical.  However, in this show, all the company was engaged in every word, in every song. The Gilbert and Sullivan comedy really comes shining through.  Frederick and Edith were especially enjoyable to watch with this, but so were they all.  Having said that, I do agree with some of the comments on here, that some of the diction, particularly from the ladies, was difficult to pick up.  (I'm Australian, and I have been in a stage performance of Pirates of Penzance, so I know the words of these songs, but I can see how a general audience would have a little difficulty.)  As for the comments on David Hobson's (Frederick) age, I think he gives such a sublime performance and such an energetic one, that one forgets he is not actually 21!  He is just wonderful!  As for Anthony Warlow .... what can you say .... the man in simply a genius!",1309824000,,1371,4.506072874493927
8358329,3,B0029WLJFC,"In my opinion, this is a superb performance - apart from importing a song from Ruddigore (and it fits quite well so I'm not complaining), there are no great changes to the work, the orchestrations are pretty well as Sullivan wrote them and the performance is fresh, alive and very enjoyable - highly recommended. You'll need to have seen Pirates of the Caribbean to appreciate the pirate king's mannerisms but it's all done in good taste and with real Gilbertian spirit.

The major disappointment is the blu ray. ABC's DVD of the same performance has lots of extras - documentaries and interviews - and gives you the option of stereo or 5.1 surround sound. The blu-ray has no extras and just stereo. I have the DVD which I shall continue to play in preference to the blu-ray because, with a decent sound system, the surround sound track adds greatly to the atmosphere.

Despite what Amazon say, both DVD and blu-ray are 16:9 anamorphic widescreen.

I assume that the extras and second sound track were sacrificed to save a few pennies - maybe so that it would fit on a single layer disc. If so, Kultur, the disc's American publishers, should be ashamed of themselves.",1305936000,,1167,4.71078431372549
8358330,4,B0029WLJFC,"It seems that all the Australian G&S DVD's are not available in region 2 format.  Does any one know why this is??
I am sure that the UK G&S market would buy very many if in region 2 format.

8358331,3,B0029WLJFC,"This disc amply illustrates the weaknesses of performances recorded on stage.  No producer of a movie version of The Pirates of Penzance would cast a 50-year-old in the role of Frederic, especially now in the era of high definition.  Combine Hobson's obvious age with his mature tenor voice, and he comes across as a middle-aged rake instead of the 21-year-old he is supposed to be.  Mabel looks younger, but hardly a ""maiden.""  (Her voice, however, is wonderful.)  Seen from a theater seat, these casting problems could be ignored; the Blu-ray picture makes them a constant distraction.

Sound quality is a second weakness of stage recordings, and other reviewers' comments about the difficulty of understanding the dialog may simply reflect this.  Certainly the sometimes muffled sound of the chorus, especially when they are clumping around on the stage, is a typical---and unfortunate---artifact of stage productions.  The uneven balance between singers and orchestra is another.  There is, after all, a reason that most CD recordings are made in a studio rather than on a live stage.  Some listeners may prefer the vitality(?) of a live performance; I'll accept some obvious lip-syncing for the better sound quality of studio recording.  Unfortunately, movie productions of opera and operetta are rare, presumably because they are expensive to produce.",1266278400,2,1357,5.323943661971831
8358332,3,B0029WLJFC,"The Bluray highdef is excellent, and the singing, acting, and staging are very good and in the humorous spirit of Gilbert & Sullivan.  However, to fully enjoy Gilbert & Sullivan one must be able to understand the lyrics; in this performance it is frequently impossible to understand what the singers and especially the chorus are saying. (I have found that this is frequently a problem when G&S is performed by opera singers.) Because of this, I only give 3 stars to what would otherwise have been a 5 star recording.",1263686400,2,517,4.7444444444444445
8358333,3,B0029WLJFC,"It's a very good performance, although the Pirate King seems to think he's Captain Jack Sparrow.....

My real complaint is that it's only Dolby Pro Logic (2 channel) and 720P! I have a 1080P 67"" set and I can tell the difference with this. Plus, the miking was frequently off.

They should have/could have done better.",1249862400,2,318,4.660714285714286
