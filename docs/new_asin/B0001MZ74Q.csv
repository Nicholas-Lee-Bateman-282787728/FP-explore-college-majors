2016492,5,B0001MZ74Q,"'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Volume 10: Secret Origins' contains four episodes on one disc. We get the conclusion of the ""Turtles in Space"" story arc with Part 5 - ""Triceraton Wars"", and the three ""Secret Origins"" episodes.
I absolutely hated the ""Turtles In Space"" episodes, which almost made me give this DVD a 4-star rating instead of a 5, but those ""Secret Orgins"" episodes are so good that I couldn't possibly give this anything lower than a 5.
The ""Secret Orgins"" line of episodes are probably the best that this show has ever had. They include some funny references to the old Turtle's cartoon, and the story is so shocking, exciting, and entertaining that you'll love it.
If you get any of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles DVD's, make sure to get this one first. Don't worry if you haven't seen the previous episodes, they do a pretty good job of narrating and explaining what previously happened.",1086739200,3,908,4.753164556962025

8014860,3,B0001MZ74Q,"This is the second chapter of season two of the 2003 TMNT cartoon. It features the final part of the five-part Turtles in Space saga, then the complete Secret Origins three-parter.  It does its job decently well, though having only one part of a five-parter seems like a poor choice. The main complaint about this disk is that the opening recap narrations have been cut from Secret Origins parts 2 and 3. Now, true, they're mostly letting you know things you already know, but they're done in-universe and give little glimpses into the characters' psyches. The season two box set (part 1) does a better job (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Season-2-Part-1/dp/B0010X8NGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 2, Part 1</a>), as it doesn't split up any multi-parters and includes the complete narrations. It's sadly out of print and a bit expensive though.",1371600000,,947,5.81294964028777
8014861,5,B0001MZ74Q,"The turtles finally manage to make it back to the TCRI building after their adventures in another galaxy.  But there's just no rest for our heros.  The turtles finally learn the truth pertaining to the utroms in an amazing Vr simulation.  They are taken back to futile Japan and witness the arrival of this peaceful alien race.  But they also run into someone who is shockingly familiar.  Now the past and present are about to collide.  For outside the Vr simulation, the Shredder and his foot ninjas begin an asalt on the TCRI building.  Its a fight to the finish.  Shredder and the foot verses the fab four...  uh five counting Splinter.  So check it out!",1146700800,,657,4.586206896551724
8014862,1,B0001MZ74Q,"I recommend not purchasing this video tape.  The storylines and animation are top form, as usual.  I rated this tape low because there are 4 or 5 minutes missing from the second episode on the tape - a fair sized omission when an episode is only about 20 minutes long.  The last 4 or 5 minutes of the ""Secret Origins, Part 1"" episode are not to be found on this tape. I contacted 4 Kids Entertainment about a problem with another tape (see my review of ""The Ultimate Ninja""), and received prompt and courteous replies.  After reading Lunn's review, I wrote to 4 Kids Entertainment asking if there were any problems with this tape such as Lunn described.  4 Kids Entertainment's response was that there were no problems, and Lunn was the only person to indicate that there was a problem.  Imagine my surprise when I received my copy of this tape, and the tape had the same problem Lunn described in their review here on Amazon.com.  No response so far from 4 Kids Entertainment when I wrote to them about there being a problem with my copy of this tape.  I'll update if I do hear from 4 Kids Entertainment.  Amazon.com provided excellent customer service about my problem (as they always do!), but of course Amazon.com cannot do anything about the missing segment.

Again, my rating solely reflects the quality of this tape, i.e. the missing segment of the episode ""Secret Origins, Part 1"".  My opinion of the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series remains very high.  I just didn't realize that when I became a fan of this new animated series purchasing DVDs and a DVD player were prerequisites. Or that getting all, and/or all of, the episodes described on the tape sleeve would become a hit and miss proposition.  :(",1098835200,2,1724,4.65016501650165
8014863,3,B0001MZ74Q,"This DVD contains the last episode of the ""Turtles in Space"" story arc (which frankly, we should've gotten on the last dvd) and the complete ""Secret Origins"" 3-parter.

Unfortunately, I disagree with the previous reviewer. Yes, if you're a fan of the new series, you NEED to see these episodes - a shocking plot point concerning the Shredder is revealed here, which seperates this series from every other TMNT continuity before it. There are also some hilarious references to the classic toon from the early 90's that older fans will appreciate.

However, Secret Origins is badly written and poorly paced. The major revelation is broadcasted so far in advance that even the youngest fans will pick up on it. The Turtles spend a little too much time in the virtual reality simulator, which is somewhat amusing but really pointless. And Baxter, for no real plausible reason, has been coerced again into working for the Shredder. These episodes are still a lot of fun, but don't come off quite as strong as the ""Return to New York"" arc from season 1, which I feel is the best.

But enough with that. Ninja Turtles has never been about strong writing or plot, but lots and lots of cool action. Get this disc.",1093910400,5,1204,4.723809523809524
8014864,1,B0001MZ74Q,"I purchased this video and, as long as you aren't expecting to be able to watch the entire episode, it is okay.  I contacted the company to complain about a missing segment and they won't even acknowledge there is a problem, let alone replace the tape with a good one.  Maybe you will have better luck. . . .",1092700800,,308,4.203389830508475
