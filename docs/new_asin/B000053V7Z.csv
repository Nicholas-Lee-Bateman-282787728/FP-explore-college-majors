I don't watch many dubs, but before I discovered the subbed Sailormoon S I was a dubbie. :p  Baka me!  Anyway, on to the movie.  It was *okay*.  I didn't give it one star because I liked the ep where they defeated Jedite.  (Jadeite is the CORRECT spelling)!  I wish they had this movie subtitled and in my beloved Japanese.  :)  I am not Japanese (most of us on here aren't) but I am learning it and I've fallen in love with this language.  Sailor Mars is *okay* but I like her better in the Japanese.",996796800,,595,4.176991150442478

1389788,4,B000053V7Z,"Matchpoint for Sailor Moon was the very first episode I ever saw of this show, and it got me hooked forever. How can you not fall in love with a character stuck inside a huge tennis ball being bounced around? This collection is by far my favorite, and if you're a Sailor Moon fan, you have to agree these are some of the best.  This video has it all-  action, intrigue, romance, and meatballs.",976147200,,393,4.297297297297297

7930021,4,B000053V7Z,"In this third volume of the first season, we get two important episodes to the main story arch. As several other reviewers have mentioned, the title to this tape is misleading. Sailor Mars debuted in the second volume.

Episode 9: Cruise Blues - Jedite sets up a fake cruise to lure couples and steal their energy. Raye wins 2 tickets and takes Amy, prompting Serena to sneak on board. This is a fun filler episode that has some good chemistry between Amy & Raye.

Episode 10: Fight to the Finish - Queen Beryl is tired of Jedite constantly failing to steal energy. With one more chance to prove himself, Jedite challenges the 3 sailor scouts to a final battle. This becomes the toughest fight yet for the girls as they give it everything they've got. In the end, good triumphs over evil.

Episode 11: Match Point for Sailor Moon - 1st Appearance of Nephlite, Zoycite. With Jedite gone, Queen Beryl allows Nephlite to take over. He attempts to steal energy from one of Molly's friends, who plays tennis. Meanwhile, Serena is angry at Raye for doubting her scout ability. Serena faces down Nephlite's monster by herself to prove her strength to the Sailor Mars.

Episode 12: Unnatural Phenomena - one of the local parks is set to be torn down and replace with buildings and parking lot. Nephlite attempts to steal the energy of the park's gardener. Meanwhile, Raye attempts to seduce Darien and Serena shows signs of jealous.",1104192000,3,1424,4.706827309236948
7930022,4,B000053V7Z,"Just thought I'd tell that to everyone thinking this was the video where Raye became a Sailor Scout.  This video contains episodes 9-12 from the first season of Sailor Moon.  I recommend it to anyone who missed the first season when it was on TV.  Here is basically what each episode on the video is about:

Cruise Blues: Serena wants to go on a cruise more then anything else in the world.  That's why she is upset when Raye wins tickets to go on a dream cruise, and invites Amy instead!  Time to use the Luna Pen...

Fight to the Finish:  It's Jedite's last chance to prove himself to Queen Beryl, and this time, he's calling the Scouts out!

Match Point for Sailor Moon: Nephlite is going to prove that he is better then Jedite was, and he has found a new way of collecting energy...one victim at a time, starting with Serena's friend Molly's role model, a tennis player with ""hidden"" potential.

Unnatural Phenomena: Amy is more then upset when builders threaten to destroy the beautiful park in which her gardener friend works.  At the same time, Nephlite sees his chance to steal more energy, by turning the wildlife of the park against the Sailor Scouts!",1098403200,,1161,4.5603864734299515
