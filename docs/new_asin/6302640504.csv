487360,5,6302640504,"How Green Was My Valley. One of my favourite films. I ran this motion picture in the 'New Theatre' West end Terrace, Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire in 1970.
Despite all the rubbish that has been written about this classic  John Ford production and Richard Llewellyn (author of the book).This was  also the favourite film of my grandfather, the late John Joseph Price, who  worked in the South Wales mining industry from 1911 - 1963. Many times he  and I watched it on television and my grandfather was able to advise me  what was in fact true and what was pure Hollywood.
Also working  underground, as my grandfather's 'boys', were the late Ron Evans - former  parliamentary agent for Aneurin Bevan and Harold 'Tootsie' Jones. From  knowing these people also I was able to learn, that despite this film's  shortcomings John Ford managed to capture the spirit and the essence of the  Welsh mining valley communities. This classic motion picture, made during  the golden era of cinema when directors, producers, stars, technicians  really knew their craft because they had to work at it to survive, and the  word 'star' was not easily tagged on to any actor/actress as easily as it  is today.
I recommend that anyone really interested in cinema should  study this film in depth because it presents an excellent example of the  working. social and political conditions which once existed in the valley  towns and villages of South Wales, which, has now entirely disappeared.",961286400,5,1465,4.914285714285715
487361,5,6302640504,"One of Ford's best.  1941 was a magical year for film and ""How Green"" was one of the reasons.  Ford was a master of the B&W medium and his use of shadow, light, and detail in ""How Green"" is  nothing short of absolute genius.  Every single frame of the 169,920 total  is a masterpiece.
I envy anyone who will see this film for the first  time.  It's pure joy.  I've seen it more than a hundred times and marveled  at its magnificence each time.",951868800,4,443,4.178571428571429
487362,5,6302640504,"Grown tired of today's insipid action films heavy on raw violence and special effects and lean on believable plot?  If so, this film is one to consider because it is the opposite of today's moronic films.  John Ford brings to life Richard Llewelyn's poetic tale of the travails of the Morgan family in late-Victorian Wales.  Simple, vital emotions pour out in front of the viewer's eyes- the sorrow of a mother whose boys gradually are forced to leave home due to the economic stresses of the coalfields, the raucus drinking after one of the boy's wedding, the death of ordinary, wonderful men in mine accidents etc., etc..  Ford is probably America's greatest director and this is probably his greatest work.  END",887068800,6,714,4.867768595041323

487481,5,6302640504,"How Green Was My Valley is the story of Welsh miners in the late Nineteenth Century, centering on the large Morgan Family, which is headed by Gwilyam Morgan, played by Donald Crisp, who won an Academy Award for the role. John Ford won his third Oscar as best director for this film, and it also won Best Picture, which has created some controversy over time (more on this later). It was hugely successful with both the critics and the public and was the biggest box office film of 1942. It has been preserved in the National film Registry as one of the films preserved for its cultural, historical and aesthetic qualities that make it an important part of America's film heritage. Besides that it's a heartwarming picture that portrays the sorrows and joys of working people and their essential dignity and worthiness.

The point of view is that of Huw (Roddy McDowell), the youngest member of the Morgan Family, who recalls it all in retrospect as he is about to leave years after the events of the story. Putting such a major picture on the shoulders of a boy who had done only one major film in America was taking a great risk, but he was up to it. He was also supported by an excellent cast including a nineteen year old Maureen O'Sullivan as his older sister, Sara Allgood as his mother and Walter Pidgeon as the local minister. The Welsh are known for their choral singing, and there is a great deal of it in the film by a genuine Welsh choir. It's as much singing as you'd find in most musicals, though it is used in an entirely different way. The film is also supported by one of Alfred Newman's sweetest and most well thought of scores, full of the high string passages he was known for. Twentieth Century Fox built a Welsh Village on eighty acres in the hills above Malibu and the cinematography and art direction also won Academy Awards. If you enjoy classic black and white films, this is one of the great ones of the era and is not to be missed.

EXTRA: Refuting the unfair criticism of How Green was My Valley.
Despite the continued praise, this film comes in for some heavy, and most often misguided criticism from people who don't seem to understand the film's era and criticize it for not being the type of film made decades later, in essence criticizing it for being a Forties film. Some pan it for its sentimentality, its sweet vignettes of daily life and even its sweet score, saying it should be grittier, meaner and ""more realistic"". I've even seen criticism that said it should be like the gritty British ""kitchen sink films"" of the early Sixties, as if it didn't take two decades for those films to be possible. This is an early 40's film and it contains all the feelings, style and conventions of a 1940's film and if you don't get that you're being clueless.

The film is hated by some, especially film students, because it won the Best Picture Oscar over Citizen Kane. But How Green Was My Valley was exactly the kind of film that everyone loved and was just the type of film that would win and is of the highest standard in every department and no embarrassment as some winners have been in retrospect. Citizen Kane is beloved as a directorial accomplishment by people powerful in the film world: critics, directors and ardent film buffs, but it has never been taken up by the public and garners more respect than love. Kane was not a big hit film and its reputation was gained only as years went by. How Green Was My Valley also won the New York Critic's award for 1942.

Other criticism is clueless. Those who have read the book say the book had so much more in it. Of course it did. It's the book. The book always has a lot more than the film. This was a sprawling novel that was originally planned as a Gone Like the Wind, four-hour film but which was later cut down. There is a valid argument that the adaptation is weak in parts. The characters make important life decisions seemingly without any motivation. People who have read the book have explained to me why they did these things, and a few sentences in the film could have cleared things up. This is an oversight by the film's creative team, likely because they were so familiar with the material.

More criticism is nit-picking. ""It wasn't shot in Wales!"" It was originally planned to be but a little thing called World War II got in the way. ""The accents aren't Welsh"". Hollywood only had about three accents to cover all of America at a time when regional accents were much stronger than they are today. They just weren't interested in such details, and if they didn't get the U.S. right, I wouldn't expect them to get the British Isles right, either. Besides, outside the U.K. virtually no one knows what a Welsh accent sounds like anyway.

Roddy McDowell shouldn't have been the only actor playing Huw. This does create problems. Though the film takes place over several years, he never ages. On top of that, though he was thirteen, he looks ten throughout. This has the effect of making it seem it all takes place in one year and also creates questions why a child is doing some of the things he does. In the original four-hour idea, Tyrone Power was going to play the grown up Huw. But they decided to do one section of the book and it was probably thought that the continuity of one actor was better than two or three young actors.",1468627200,2,5330,4.495356037151703

487531,4,6302640504,"Shares the theme with Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"", of the previous year, of conflicts between labor and management in the setting of an extended family. Also, a lament  of the Faustian bargain between the costs and benefits of industrialization. .
  Centers on the sizable Morgan coal Morgan coal mining Welsh family. Donald Crisp won an academy award for his portrayal of the family patriarch. The plot includes the growing pains of the youngest son: Huw, who has problems with the school master and bullies at school, in trying to fulfill his father's ambition for him to seek a higher status career than his coal digging older brothers. However, we see him working in the mine, moving in with his brother's widow, trying to help support her: a very awkward situation. In the book this film is based upon, Huw, by then , is a young man, so not as awkward.
  Huw's older sister is pretty enough to marry the mine owner's son, but doesn't love him. Instead , she has eyes for the new minister, eventually causing a gossip-fueled incident. The minister decides it's best if he leaves town, after chewing out the congregation for not trusting his morals. But, just then , a mine explosion kills papa Morgan. Now, Hug is the only male Morgan left in town, his brothers having left after their older brother died in that mine accident.
  Too many loose ends at the end for me. Does the minister still plan to leave town, after taking part in the miner rescue operation? Does Huw, still a juvenile as portrayed, leave town , as he says in the beginning of the film.  What is the fate of his widowed mother and sister-in-,law? The book this film is  based upon continues with several sequels.
  The film ends with a montage of how things were in the happy past of the Morgans, when all lived  in this green valley, before it was defiled by piles of coal, coal waste and coal air pollution.
  First-billed Walter Pigeon's forte was eloquent speaking and a tall slim patrician presence. . Thus, he is OK, if not overly charismatic, as the minister. He also apparently has a decent singing voice, but preferred straight drama. He even turned down the lead role in the film ""Showboat"".
  I prefer fast moving musicals and adventure/western films over this mostly slow-moving drama.",1460505600,,2272,4.685138539042821

487559,3,6302640504,"Admittedly I watched this with the idea that this movie was such a classic and had great performers in it. It wasn't quite as good as I had expected.

People have panned this for the performers not having proper Welsh accents or the scenario looking too much like California. But the truth is that even without World War Two going on, the Hollywood film industry was actually in bad financial shape during the Great Depression like everybody else, and it would have been too expensive and difficult to make everything properly look and sound like Wales, let alone go on location. The idea was to show essentially a poor mining town, even if the settings didn't match the interiors of actual Welsh houses.

I have not seen the book, so I cannot say how well the movie follows it. Admittedly the major problem was that the script was rather disjointed. It starts off with the protagonist talking about leaving his village and describing how it was when he was growing up. The first part has the miners going on strike when their wages are cut, and the father denounces the idea of his sons joining a labor union (though not explaining why). Later on, the mine owner's son wants to marry the family's daughter, and she is in love with the local preacher but marries the son anyway. Huw, the son who tells the story, is sent to the local school, gets bullied by classmates and teacher, fights back, and eventually graduates with honors, but chooses to work in the mine. That is never explained either.

The movie's fundamental problem is that things happen one after another, but without explanations about people's attitudes and why they are what they are, or why people make certain choices which seem illogical. In the end, we don't even know why the protagonist finally leaves the valley when he does, or what he plans to do.",1455494400,,1825,4.661490683229814

487575,3,6302640504,"I remember that when I was in high school I struggled through the book on which this film is based (for required summer reading) and didn't enjoy the process one whit.  So I had my doubts about the movie--and, in fact, its ending does leave viewers a bit up in the air about the fates of two of the major characters.  Yet it's also an engaging story of family bonds and trials.  Around 1899, young Huw (Hugh) Morgan (Roddy McDowall in his first major role) lives in a Welsh village where ""the colliery"" has only just begun to change the land and the lives of the people.  His father Gwilym (Donald Crisp) and brothers Ivor (Patric Knowles), Ianto (YAN-to) (John Loder), Owen (James Monks), Davy (Richard Fraser), and Gwilym (Evan S. Evans) are all coal miners and proud of the work they do; his mother Beth (Sara Allgood) and big sister Angharad (an-GAR-ad) (Maureen O'Hara) are the glue that holds the family together.  After Huw is very nearly crippled for life in saving his mother from an icy pond, the whole family resolves that he shall have a better life than the mine has to offer, and with the help of the new pastor, Mr. Gruffydd (Griffith) (Walter Pidgeon), he's prepared for the ""National School"" in one of the nearby valleys.  But a tyrannical schoolmaster (Morton Lowry) and the scorn of his mates for a ""dirty"" miner's child make him choose the colliery even after attaining honors.  Meanwhile there are moments of joy, such as Ivor's wedding to Bronwen (Anna Lee) and his summons to a command performance before the Queen with his choir of singers; of conflict, such as Huw's brothers' advocacy of a union, which Gwilym Sr. condemns as socialism; of tragedy, such as Ivor's loss in a mine mishap and the gradual fracturing of the family, with the older boys, one after another, discharged from the mine and leaving for America and points beyond; and, astonishingly, of great honor, as Iestyn (YES-tin) Evans (Marten Lamont), the son of the mine owner, asks permission to court Angharad, and marries her despite her love for Gruffydd.  (Exactly why he takes her to South Africa instead of staying on to run the mine--or returning after his father's death--is, frustratingly, never explained; maybe that sequence ended up on the cutting-room floor.)

Crisp won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Gwilym Sr., and deserved it; he creates a strict but loving paterfamilias who insidiously works his way into your sympathies.  (McDowall should probably have gotten a special award for his role.)  The reproduction of Welsh life, the distinctive lilt and grammar of their speech, and their beautiful spontaneous singing (done in Welsh by actual Welsh singers) are high points, and Gruffydd and Angharad's understated romance is nicely done--but it would have been nice to know whether they ever got together in the end.  (I suppose I'll have to read the book again to find out.)",1451692800,,2900,4.824596774193548
487576,5,6302640504,"Heartwarming, relevant story even by today's standards about a large family & its struggles in a small Welsh coal-mining town narrated by its now quite old - youngest son Huw Morgan, played here wondrously by a young Roddy McDowell - who seems to set the tone for the whole movie & cast, including the great Donald Crisp, Sara Allgood, Maureen O'Hara, Walter Pidgeon & everyone else I've left out.  John Ford created imagery, mood & narration so unforgettable, it only becomes more poignant & meaningful with age.

487781,4,6302640504,"A very young Roddy McDowall plays ""Huw Morgan,"" who provides the viewer with retrospective narration as an adult in this heartfelt drama, a deserving 1941 Oscar Winner for Best Picture, about growing up as the youngest of 7 children in his Welsh family, which includes his lovingly ardent parents (played by Donald Crisp and Sara Allgood) and 5 older brothers and 1 older sister, ""Angharad,"" tenderly played by Maureen O'Hara, a film heartened by its unwavering soundtrack (which other movies should strive to match).  Walter Pidgeon (Oscar Winner for Best Supporting Actor) plays his sister's true love, ""Mr. Gruffydd,"" the town preacher (who even reserves a spot in his caring heart for little Huw, his potential brother-in-law, as Huw recovers from an accident), but will their love ever have a chance, especially when Mr. Gruffydd tells Angharad to pass on him because he can't sufficiently provide for her? Are the Morgan brothers destined to be coal miners, like their father? What will become of little Huw, especially when he's bullied at school?  McDowall successfully fulfills his opportunity to carry this entire picture on his dimunitive but capable shoulders, a rarity on film for such a young actor.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a grand, emotionally overwhelming spectacle that tugs on every familial heartstring.

487853,5,6302640504,"This is a beautiful movie. The performances were great. It is a nostalgic recollection by Huw, the youngest son of the Morgan family. He narrates his memories of a pristine Welsh valley, living in a strong, traditional family. He has good role models in his father, mother, older brothers, and the minister who is a  mentor to Huw. The lowering of wages from the coal mine, and the differing opinions in the family of how to deal with the mine owners is a conflict between father and sons. Despite the conflict, the family loyalty and love remains steadfast. The coal slag encroaches on the beautiful valley, and will eventually cover even their home.
There is stunning music from a Welsh men's choir. There is a beautiful rhythm to the dialog, which gives a feel for the pattern of the Welsh language.
It is a bittersweet movie, but powerful and uplifting.",1413936000,2,857,4.713333333333333

HGWMV is portraying Wales life as so simplistic that I almost forgot the crushing poverty, the class system, starving kids, early death, mines that are death traps and homicidal depression and many more injustice's waiting in the dark, waiting to strike. I give HGWMV  2.355 thumbs down, down in the dirt, right where the defective company saw had cut them off, blood dirt and sawdust coated the thumb bits. Yes HGWMV, well lets see.

The story was sad, and judging from the very beginning of the movie and maybe even the title, one was prepared for the sadness that was to come.  A great lesson in human nature and history.  The boy's valley was green but as a child who had the potential for a wonderful life ahead of him, the harsh realities of life as they were, nipped his potential in the bud.

488101,3,6302640504,"Hmm.  Close to 190 reviews of this, as of January, 2014.  That makes ""My Valley"" still a pretty popular item--rare, for a b&w feature that is now (gasp!) over 70 years old.

I am pretty familiar with Ford's bio and his westerns, knew about this movie, but can't recall ever watching it.  Did so last night. In fact, I watched the ""backstory"" feature and decided NOT to watch it alone, but wait until my 59 year old wife came back from work so we could enjoy it together. My mistake...and my surprise.

First question from her as the credits rolled: how OLD is this movie?  When I told her she groaned.  Ten minutes later.  ""I'm bored now.""  Give it time, I suggested.  She did.  We had scarcely reached the point where young Huw is bed-ridden, when she said, ""Still bored,"" and I removed it and we watched an episode of the TV crime drama, A Person of Interest.

I couldn't help feeling sad about this--I'm a real film fan (she likes them, but isn't so ardent)--and the experience taught me a lot. She didn't care that it was Roddy McDowell's first film performance. Nor that Donald Crisp (""which one is he?"") won Best Supporting Actor Oscar. She didn't care about the nuances of pacing, of the painstaking recreation of the mining town, the great Award-winning cinematography.  To her, it just seemed a slow and old fashioned way to tell a story (I didn't dare mention that Ford's usual ""comic"" episodes and his typical song-and-dance scenes were kept to a minimum, here. Lord knows what she would have thought of The Quiet Man!)

I was also reminded of the anger and frustration of a university film course professor who rolled The Searchers for his students, and watched them laugh and sneer at the movie, its premise and its performances.  ""They just don't get it,"" he fumed.  Hmm.

It was good to get her perspective--it stopped me from giving this film 4 stars--and maybe put this film into perspective for most millennium viewers.  Time passes.  Many films were ""classics"" of THEIR day...but that ""day"" isn't our day, any more. I'm watching the rest of this movie--alone.",1390435200,,2078,4.65934065934066

How Green was my Valley relates the various experiences and adventures of the Scottish Morgan family in a mining village seen through the eyes of the youngest son Huw. What grabbed me most is how they all had such a strong sense of community, regardless of their differences. Even when the daughter and older sons grew up and went their ways they still took the time to keep in touch with each other. In other words, they were still together in heart and mind.
I understand there's been a lot of controversy over this movie winning Best Motion Picture of 1941 instead of Citizen Kane. They are both equally terrific but very different films. Kane's subject is political, Valley's is familial. Kane is relentlessly serious, Valley goes back and forth from grave and serious to warm and sunny. They both feature fine acting, direction, great photography and writing. If it had been one or the other winning, I would have been fine.

Roddy McDowall doesn't put much of an impression on the screen but it doesn't really matter since this is one of those movies where the main character is only an observer and the secondary characters set the scene. Walter Pidgeon is wonderful as the zealous, upright Rev. Gruffydd. My favorite of his scenes are:
1. When he stands up to his deacons at church when they try to single Angarhad Morgan out for a false accusation of adultery. He says they are a cowardly, hypocritical bunch who only go through the motions at church for fear of the wrath of God and forget that God's mercy and forgiveness is just as real as his wrath and judgment.
2. When he goes down the flooded mine shaft with Huw and the boxer in search of Mr. Morgan.

Over the past few years Hollywood and television has acquired a habit of making preachers look like complete fools so How Green was my Valley is a real treat in the sense that it shows there are saints as well as prudes in Christendom.
Best of all is Donald Crisp (who won a well-deserved Supporting Actor award) and Sara Allgood as the true blue parents who always put the interests of their children and friends before their own. Maureen O'Hara and Anna Lee are beautiful and not asked to do much else.

The cinematography and set design are absolutely gorgeous and deserved their Oscars but once again, like Best Picture, it was a tough call. Alfred Newman's mixture of choral and orchestral melodies is magnificent.

All in all How Green was My Valley is great and inspiring entertainment.",1384905600,,3006,4.986027944111776

It was an early film treatment of a Welsh family and its social and economic problems with its coal industry.  A treatment not yet as mature as today's films, or at least a different outlook.  It would seem more like a high school play, not really because of its acting, but its approach to the problem.  A family too solid, but not able to cope with present struggles, yet a sentimental look from a youngest son now grown looking back with feeling on how green his valley was as he grew up, not yet stained by the economic problems of the industry. A poetic look into a real social problem.

488172,5,6302640504,"John Ford's masterpiece ""How Green Was My Valley""(1941) comes laden with Oscar glory from the Golden Age of the Hollywood studio system. It was the richly deserved recipient of the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Black-and-White Cinematography and Best Black-and White Interior Decoration Academy Awards. Its main Oscar competitors were ""Citizen Kane"", Orson Welles' wildly overrated (by the AFI, among others) and self important take down of William Randolph Hearst (see Pauline Kael on the subject) and ""The Maltese Falcon"", John Huston's brilliant but bleak portrayal of mankind at its greediest and most treacherous. ""Valley"", while not blinking in the face of death, cruelty and destruction, opts for a far more positive attitude about life and the human species. The merit of ""Valley's"" Oscars is evidenced by the loving Blu-ray transfer from 20th century Fox.
""Valley"" is a memory piece, imperfect as all memories are; it is also a coming of age story of a young bibliophile who emerges as a writer himself and provides the voice-over narration which informs the story. It is set in late Victorian Wales, with working people as its central characters for the second straight time in a major Ford production. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940) is perhaps the definitive fictional depiction of migrant workers. ""Valley"" serves the same function for coal miners. Ford details this world both in the boy, Huw's, sentimental retrospect and in its harsh reality. Huw, endearingly played by Roddy McDowell, attends a national school where class prejudice and brutality inside and outside of the classroom are prevalent; he is one of a number of pre-adolescent boys who work in the coal mine; gossip and self righteous shunning pass for morality in a world dominated by an antiquated sexist and unloving code. ""Valley"" shows us a Celtic patriarchy in decline because of changing economic conditions and social attitudes. It also shows us an industrial system grounded in environmental hazard and the exploitation of the workers.
The 2 dominant institutions in this ""Valley"" are the colliery and the church. They are artfully juxtaposed in the massive set constructed on an 80 acre site in the Santa Monica Mountains. This Blu-ray captures the very texture of the stone cottages, which house the workers in close physical and emotional proximity, and the interplay of light and shadow on the low hung ceilings which shelter and circumscribe their inhabitants. (Take that Gregg Toland and ""Citizen Kane"".)
Chief among the villagers are the Morgans, a family of 6 sons and a daughter, Angharad, played by Maureen O'Hara, new to the Ford stock company but one who would evolve into the quintessential Ford heroine in ""The Quiet Man""(1952). The father (Donald Crisp) is the head of the family and the mother (Sara Allgood, Oscar nominee and Abbey Theatre veteran in the role of her film career) is its heart. She risks life and limb in a wintry landscape to defend her husband's honor at a strikers' rally in the hills. The lightly erotic interplay between Allgood and Crisp (she calls him ""boy"" and he her ""girl"") is a charming depiction of a long and tradition laden marriage.
Crisp's Oscar winning character, Gwilym Morgan,  is the polar opposite of the brutal father who terrorizes his perpetually virginal waif of a daughter, played by Lillian Gish, in D.W. Griffith's ""Broken Blossoms"" (1919). Here he is stern but loving, a leader both within his family and within the mining community, a man who reveres his Bible yet is intellectually inquisitive when being tutored in math alongside his youngest son. Crisp's death scene, due to a mine cave-in, is the emotional high point of the film and exhibit number one in the presentation of genuine sentiment, as opposed to sentimentality, which suffuses the film. Ford's triptych presentation of Huw's father figures in the lift, balanced against the 3 black shawled Madonnas of mother, daughter and daughter-in-law, is both emotionally and visually striking.
This densely textured, virtually speck free Blu-ray is a glory of black and white cinematography and profits from an enhanced Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. (I was startled by the depth and clarity of such a small sound as the opening and closing of a door.)
The film is 72 years old and full of traditional family values, yet it lives in the collective memory (and what else is film?) of film fans, especially those of the Celtic variety. Never has such a vision been as articulately spoken as it is in this splendid 20th Century Fox Blu-ray.",1371600000,3,4566,5.079893475366179

488200,5,6302640504,"""How Green Was My Valley"" is famous as the film that beat ""Citizen Kane"" for the 1941 Best Picture Oscar. That has dampened the film's reputation, undeservedly. ""How Green Was My Valley"" is one of Ford's greatest achievements--equal to ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or ""The Quiet Man""--and, as the ""Making Of"" documentary of this DVD tell us, it was Ford's personal favorite of all his films.

""Citizen Kane"" is the more daring and innovative film, but ""How Green Was My Valley"" has the greater emotional impact. It's a great example of old-fashioned Hollywood filmmaking at its very best. Ford, working with screenwriter Philip Dunne from Richard Llewellyn's book, created a film that combines rollicking humor and tearjerking tragedy with remarkable seamlessness. The actors--from the veterans Donald Crisp, Barry Fitzgerald and Sara Allgood to 13-year-old Roddy McDowall, making his film debut--could not be better. The black-and-white photography by Arthur Miller is breathtakingly beautiful, most notably in two scenes: the scene in the meadow in which Walter Pidgeon encourages McDowall to walk again after a terrible illness, and the hellish subterranean scene of the flooded, caved-in mine at the end.

The ""Making Of"" documentary contains a lot of fascinating information about the fraught but fruitful relationship between Ford and Darryl F. Zanuck, two hard-headed control freaks who understood each other very well. It also contains an illuminating quote from Peter Bogdanovich, who was friends with both Welles and Ford. ""Citizen Kane,"" he said, is a movie from the head, whereas ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a movie from the heart. In the end, the only conceivable objection to awarding a Best Picture Oscar to ""How Green Was My Valley"" is that the prize did not go to ""Citizen Kane."" Which movie should have won? That's a matter of opinion.",1369180800,4,1847,5.194630872483222

488215,5,6302640504,"It has become the in thing to denigrate this film over other films from 1941 such as THE MALTESE FALCON, THE LADY EVE, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, SERGEANT YORK and especially, CITIZEN KANE.  You see, this is the film that beat out the Welles film for Best Picture and everything else at the Oscars that year, and to cineasts, that is an unpardonable sin.  A film that has gorgeous cinematography, pitch-perfect performances, flawless direction and a literate and witty script like KANE should have won everything hands down that year.  But you see, this film also had those same ingredients plus an ending that will touch your soul, and as technically astounding and rule-breaking as KANE is, I think missing that emotional punch at the end is what made this film win Best Picture.  Is this Ford's greatest film?  Not sure-STAGECOACH and THE GRAPES OF WRATH, from less than two years before, are probably better, and you should include MY DARLING CLEMENTINE, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, THE QUIET MAN and THE SEARCHERS in that mix, as well.  However, Ford managed to elicit one of the finest child performances ever with Roddy McDowell, brilliant work from such stalwarts as Walter Pidgeon, Barry Fitzgerald, Sara Allgood and especially Donald Crisp (who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor that year over Sidney Greenstreet in MALTESE FALCON, and I would have been hard pressed to choose between either one) and a look to the film from Arthur Miller, one of the greatest cinematographers in the history of the medium (although again, choosing between this film and Gregg Toland's work on KANE probably would have had me flipping a coin) along with tossing a shout-out to unionization, I really cannot see what all the fuss is about anymore.  Those who see KANE and no other film as being worthy from this year really ought to give this film another look, and if by the end they can still only prefer the Welles film after drying their eyes, then those people have no hearts.",1366675200,6,1965,4.813056379821958

488266,5,6302640504,"January brought two John Ford masterpieces to Blu Ray for the first time and the results are stunning to say the least. Olive films released the long awaited Ford classic ""The Quiet Man""(1952) on blu ray for the first time in an impression 4K scan restoration that puts all other DVD & VHS versions to shame. Likewise, Fox has released the Oscar winning ""How Green Was My Valley""(1941) in a new Blu Ray transfer that's not only stunning, but a wonder to behold. To be honest, I was a bit hesitant to upgrade from my regular DVD of ""How Green Was My Valley"" because of Fox's recent less than steller blu rays of ""Titanic""(1953) and ""The Grapes of Wrath""(1940, another Ford classic). But when I thought of their excellent blu rays of ""All About Eve""(1950), ""Gentleman's Agreement""(1947)and ""The Hustler""(1961), I decided to take the plunge. I'm glad I did. Like Warner's recent blu ray of ""Mrs. Miniver"", ""How Green Was My Valley"" looks just beautiful on blu ray. There are no scratches, dirt, white specks, hair or debris of any kind on the film. I don't know if they used the original film negative but it sure looks like it. Although filmed in black and white, you can still get a sense of the green valley that the coal miners live and work in from Arthur C. Miller's superb cinematography. Blacks, whites and greys look stunning and every frame is crystal clear(Bitrate: 35.73).  ""How Green Was My Valley"" has been unfairly targeted over the years as the film that did not deserve the Oscar for Best Picture of 1941. Many film historians and so-called Oscar experts think that the award should have gone to ""Citizen Kane"". The same argument could be made the year before when Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" beat John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Except for ""Citizen Kane"" the other three were based on popular novels of the time and all of the films can stand on their own as filmmaking at it's best. The one thing that separates Ford from other filmmakers is how he casts the actors in his films that make you believe that you're watching a real family. Whether it's the Joads of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or the Morgans in ""How Green Was My Valley"" or the frontier family of ""The Searchers""(1956), you really believe the actors are a family. That was one of Ford's qualities as a director. Donald Crisp and Sara Allgood are superb as the heads of the Morgan family and they get great support from Ford regulars Barry Fitzgerald and Maureen O'Hara to name a few. But it's little Roddy McDowell that really touches your heart in a winsome and heartbreaking performance. It's a picture that touches on many human interest themes including daily living hardships both personal and working, conflicts, bullying, romance and even tragedy. But through it all it's the family that holds everything together. ""How Green Was My Valley"" is 119 minutes long(Aspect ratio: 1.33.1) and has the following subtitles: English SDH and French. Audio includes: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English Dolby Digital 1.0, Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0 and French DTS 5.1. Extras include ""The Making of"" featurette. If you like classic films from one of the masters then you can't go wrong with Fox's blu ray of ""How Green Was My Valley"".",1360195200,15,3212,4.756272401433692

488273,5,6302640504,"I cannot recommend this movie highly enough!  The photography is a work of art by itself, and the rich story lines, suported by brilliant directing, make this classic movie one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.  The authentic theme of the dignity and beauty of the human spirit, and of a close and loving family and its ties to its surrounding community are timeless, and especially relevant in this irreverent and irrevelant age of movies.  I especially value the simplicity of the story, where a small Welsh village becomes enthralled to the coal mining industry, becoming so dependent on it for their existence that they eventually become destroyed by it.  The true hero of the story is the father, who tries to maintain his role of  authority for his family in an effort to keep a balance between an amoral, heartless business and the deep unrest of his sons in wanting to join the union to bring about change, but with his death, the family is finally undone, the sons have moved to other countries and the mine has spewed enough slag to cover the once beautiful little village.  I feel the role of men in our modern society is under a very similar pressure, and as the influence of the last of the 'manly' men of my father's generation is finally made entirely redundant we will find our families similarly destroyed and uprooted. I must also add that the pastor of the film (Walter Pigeon) to me represents the weak and ineffectual 'cultural elite' of today.  His very unconvincing excuse of not marrying Morgan's daughter (Maureen O'hara) because he didn't feel he deserved her because of his poverty and a previous decision to serve God reflects that of so many modern men who are perpetual little boys who choose not to be fathers or take on responsibilities.  He wasn't a priest, and there was no obstacle to their union. He ruined both their lives through his selfishness.  I felt the only weak link in the movie was Pigeon , who didn't portray a convincing authenticity of a faith deep enough to resist Maureen O'hara.  In trying to appear saintly and high-minded,  he was reminiscent of Rock Hudson's romantic foil to Doris Day, where kissing her looked like he was embracing last week's fish.",1357344000,,2217,4.702842377260982

488299,5,6302640504,"This movie, based on the book, is one of John Ford's best, if not the best, movies he made.  It is an interesting character study and it is the story of a family and how outside influences can bring a family to disperse over time when their world begins to fall apart around them.

The story is told in retrospect by the youngest son and child, and is viewed through his eyes as his family changes and his hometown and surrounding valley in Wales is irrevocably changed by the coal mine that dominates the life of the village and the valley in which both exist.

The end of the movie is heart-wrenching, showing the love of a father to his youngest son, who at this point represents his entire family.  And as the father dies in a mine accident, the valley dies along with him.

488301,4,6302640504,"Walter Pidgeon is the new preacher, Maureen O'Hara is the only girl in a family of six boys, and Roddy McDowall is her youngest brother. The setting is a small coal mining town in Wales, the time is Victoria's reign. There's a coal miner's strike, which rouses the Morgan clan, and their mother goes out into the snow-covered country to challenge a meeting of miners. On the way home, she and her son fall into the river, and nearly freeze before they are pulled out. This puts McDowall and his mother in bed for an entire winter and into the spring, making it a question whether McDowall will ever walk again. But with the preacher's help, her goes up into the hills to gather daffodils for his mother in the spring, and the preacher persuades him that he can walk, and he does.

There are scenes of McDowall going to school, and his sadistic SOB of a schoolmaster, who gets his comeuppance from the local prizefighter. But instead of deciding to go into law or medicine, as his father wants, he goes down into the mines, like his brothers and his father.

There are two bad accidents in the mines, one which kills the oldest son, and another that kills the father. The rest of the boys leave for America, South Africa, and Canada.

I'm not telling this in the proper sequence, and there's lots, lots more. It's a good story, well told, and I can recommend it to anyone. I especially loved the music and singing; we are told that singing was as much a part of these people as breathing.

488326,5,6302640504,"John Ford's ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a towering masterpiece of American cinema. To label this film a tear jerker by many reviews here is to miss the point that yes, a tear will come to the eye watching the dissolution of the Morgan family, but just as quickly, John Ford will bring you to laughter and back again faster and more than any other director in cinema history. There is a reason How Green Was My Valley beat out Citizen Kane for best picture in 1941. It makes you feel something on a human level (not just the dazzling bravura of Orson Well's style, technique and vision) and reminds you of what is truly important - not just sadness and laughter. It makes you feel wonder (at both what is happening in the life of the story being told AND at how Ford manages to tell it), longing (for a family like the Morgans and the feeling we have watching them torn apart by circumstances) and a sense that you are watching something that is the ultimate in cinematic story telling and direction but also very real. How Green Was My Valley stays with you. When Maureen O'Hara rides off from her wedding to a man she does not love, and the true love of her life, Walter Pigeon, exits the side door of the church and stands there in long shot watching her go - well, that is a memory and an image that I have never forgotten. That Ford does not resort to a close up of Pigeon in his anguish, but let's him just stand there, small in the back ground after O'Hara leaves the frame informs us of how he feels, and let's us feel it as well. The master of composition, notice how Ford frames the characters in his shots to show us their importance in the family (as when Donald Crisp lines up his sons to meet one of their new girlfriends, he is larger than the others), then how he recedes in the frame as the film goes on, to illustrate his diminishing authority, reflecting the shifting balance of power in the family. This is a peak moment of movie making in America that few films today can match for it's emotional wallop, complete mastery of the elements at hand to tell a universal story that everyone can identify with, where it all comes together to produce a truly unforgettable viewing experience. If Ford had made only this one film, he would still be in the pantheon of American directors. To think he also directed The Searchers, The Grapes of Wrath, The Quiet Man, The Informer, Fort Apache, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande, The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance and My Darling Clementine is almost beyond belief.  the only winner of four best director Oscars, How Green Was My Valley was Ford's personal favorite.

The starting lines of the movie by Roddy Mcdowell's character evoke forgotten memories and nostalgic sentiments every time I see it. The whole movie is from the view point of the youngest son played by Roddy. Sara Allgood is the mother here and when her husband gets hurt by people who pelt stone at her house she goes out with her son and addresses the workers their showing them how mean and cruel they have been. When returning she and Roddy get hurt and are bed-ridden for days. This scene is really remarkable where a wife goes out in public defending her husband.

Donald Crisp renowned and much loved actor from movies like National Velvet,Jezebel (where he picks up Henry Fonda when he faints) and Lassie Come Home plays the father here. His view point on not striking as it would hurt people stand out. His relationship with Roddy is depicted really well. It won the Best Picture Oscar and is one of the best of John Ford.

There can not be one person that does not identify with his mistreatment by the schoolmaster, the later schoolmaster's taste of his own medicine and Hugh's gentle love for his sister-in-law.

488331,3,6302640504,"The hard life in a Welsh mining town in the late 19th century through the experiences of a family of miners. Filmed in Hollywood in a huge movie set and not in Wales (for obvious reasons, since in 1941 Britain was through the most critical stage of World War II), this sentimental movie is quite dated but still worth seeing. Competently directed, the most amusing thing about it is its very reactionary politics. For instance, the scene where the stern patriarch of the family jumps in joy after hearing that his sons will be singing in front of Queen Victoria can only bring guffaws today (obviously, this family is totally pro British and has no use for Welsh nationalism). Or when the same patriarch adamantly opposes his sons joining the miners union (which he sees as socialist and god knows what else). Or when he kowtows to the mine boss, hoping that his daughter will marry her son (and why, in that class saturated era, would the boss like his daughter to marry a worker's son?. The patriarch is very stern and harsh toward his children, but totally submissive towards the boss of the mine, despite the terrible working conditions there). And what about the subplot about the church elders making a ruckus about the supposedly adulterous (although not consummated) relations between the priest and the patriarch's daughter. All this look very ridiculous to a contemporary viewer. And it jumps at you when you are watching it, I'm not trying to see what is the ideological undercurrent here, it's very much upfront. I have seen little of director John Ford's movies, I admit, but what little I've seen seems both maudlin and conservative to the point of reactionary now. It could be that our social mores have changed so much in the last decades (and not always for the better) that he seems reactionary now, but I guess that even to his contemporaries Ford might have looked very conservative.",1298592000,2,1903,4.787234042553192
488332,5,6302640504,"A review of the movie How Green Was My Valley? by Gerald T. Westbrook

1. Introduction. I had not seen this movie when it first came out, but I had heard about it. As such it was the inspiration for the title of my second book: How Green Are the Gorons? Clearly both this movie and my book asks the ""How Green"" question, and the quick answer in both cases is ""not very."" More on this shortly.
2. Mythical Concepts. Before completing this comparison one needs to define ""the Gorons."" In this book a Goron is an alien from the planet Gore, the third planet in the Alpha Centauri system. It is believed they invaded Earth about the time of the flying saucer incident near Roswell New Mexico. The very first American they captured and converted was none other than Albert Gore Jr.
Surely the ""Gorons"" are a mythical concept. And in a sense ""The Valley"" in this movie is almost mythical, as the movie is shot in black & white. One never gets to see the grandeur of this valley. One never gets to see it in the many shades of green that undoubtedly existed throughout this area. Further, as the movie progresses, there seems to be more and more haze or smoke or emissions from the coal mine that made this valley even more mythical.
3. Life in the Valley. The movie ""How Green Was My Valley?"" is a story of a coal miners life and that of his family. The head of this family, Gwilyn Morgan (is played by Donald Crisp, winner of the best supporting actor Oscar). His wife, Beth (is played by Sarah Allgood, a nominee for the best supporting actress Oscar). They had five sons and two daughters (the oldest, Angharad, is played by Maureen Ohara). All sons were coal miners, albeit, the youngest (Huw, played by Roddy McDowall), could have avoided that pathway, but chose not to. As such, this family saw more than its share of coal dust and grime and occupational safety and health issues. And these miners couldn't sit down anywhere after work until completely scrubbed down and clothes changed.
This is a story of great family love, of family strength and integrity, but also includes family stress and trauma and more stress. The family minister, Merddyn Gruffydd, (is played by Walter Pidgeon). He is much more than just the minister. He serves this family well, and is a positive force in the community. As time passes, the chemistry between Angharad and Merddyn grows stronger and stronger. However, this bond is interrupted, at least in part, by her forced marriage to the mine owners son, a marriage that has no chance of success.
This is a story of the family's odyssey through hell and back, loosing one son, and at the end of the movie, the patriarch of the family, both in mine accidents.
4. Life in my valley. I have had my own journey, but with more moving around, more interactions with big businesses, more exposure to more environmental issues, but far less trauma. I also have had a rather amazing couple with coal and coal dust, particularly for a non miner. However, these are no way as major as the Morgan family. My odyssey through life on coal and coal dust is presented here as part of this comparison. I have had many exposures to these substances, particularly in Saskatchewan and in Michigan.
In Saskatchewan, I was born into a coal fired house, which meant a big basement coal bin, and monthly coal deliveries. I also lived  mile from a coal fired power plant, which had much smoke and emissions. And I also lived a half block from railroad tracks that featured a dozen or so coal fired trains a day, with much smoke and ashes. When I was 18 I took a summer job in construction. The contractor was engaged in the renovation of a large building. My first job on this project was tearing down an old coal bin, complete with much plaster and lathing in the walls and ceilings. This meant an incredible amount of coal dust could accumulate, and did. I would come home as black as one could get, and couldn't get into our house until completely hosed down. Of course there were no occupational health regulations back then.
In Michigan my first environmental exposure, in working at a huge chemical plant, was not chemical, but coal based. This plant was fueled by coal fired power plants. These were old and lacked any flue gas clean-up systems. This led to frequently seeing the top of my car turn black. It also meant putting up with coal dust on both the outside of our apartment window sills and also on the inside. I told this company that we would have to leave if this problem was not fixed. It took a year. I am now 77 and going strong, so my health was not greatly affected. However, the teachings in my life, and in ""How Green Was My Valley?"" is that use of coal, without appropriate environmental control systems can lead to pretty unacceptable conditions.
5. Environmental Controls. Surely there was need for some environmental protection of the natural surroundings in the Gilfach Goch area of southern Wales, a beautiful, but very poor area. I cover a similar area in the Goron book, specifically the ""pristine village of Springdale, PA, north of Pittsburgh"" the home of Rachel Carson. She was born in 1907, and she was reported to have wandered her valley, the banks of the Allegany, with her mother. As she grew up she watched as Springdale was slowly transformed into a grimy wasteland, its air fouled by chemical emissions, its water by industrial wastes.""
There was much about Rachel Carson with which I can salute. She was surely a lover of nature and could see that society was not doing right by nature. I would have little trouble saluting the aspects of her career that demonstrated insight, courage and tenacity. She was also something of a maverick, with no official scientific laboratory or governmental agency to support her views. I would also have little trouble supporting her original macro environmental views:
* as she watched her hometown of Springdale being destroyed;
* as she saw the near destruction of Chesapeake Bay by industrial drainage;
* as she learned about ocean pollution in Japan, specifically on Mercury and Cadmium, and
* as she found out the pesticide industry did not do adequate testing nor provide appropriate application instructions.
Initially her interests concentrated on the sea. Her first three books were on that subject. However, as time passed, her interests shifted to her concerns on pesticides in general, and on DDT in particular. As she moved further down that pathway, she went beyond the point of diminishing returns. As a result her legacy will not be her book: Silent Spring, but the millions that died in Africa and elsewhere, due to an inability to obtain DDT.
6. Conservation. Surely there was also a need for natural resource conservation in the Gilfach Goch area of southern Wales. I cover similar areas, in the Goron book, in the early west of the United States. Perhaps this can best be described by the story of Theodore Roosevelt (TR). TR knew first hand about the need for conservation. He knew about the insanity of buffalo hunting, with the bison being slaughtered and nearly eliminated. He knew about game, in general, being severely over hunted and pastures being badly over grazed. Clearly conservation efforts were needed.
A bit of the history of TR is of utility here. TR, while a mainstream easterner, lived for parts of three years, in western North Dakota. This was triggered from the loss of his wife, (who died of undiagnosed Bright's disease), and mother, (from typhoid fever), both on February 14th, 1884. These deaths occurred two days after the birth of his first child, Alice.
I was struck by his courage, and his wisdom to get away from everything of his past life, at least for awhile. In June he headed to the wild lands of North Dakota, on the far western side of that state. He was all of 25 years old. Here he learned how to be a cowboy, a rancher and a rough rider. He grew to love the beauty, vigor and challenges of the Dakota badlands and the frontier life. Clearly his life on the North Dakota frontier, and surrounding areas, is where he learned of the magnificent beauty and fragility of the west.
His major accomplishments, as President, were in the area of conservation. Included in his many contributions were the creation of 150 national forests, 3 national parks, 20 national monuments, and 55 national wildlife refuges. The three national parks were Crater Lake in Oregon, Wind Cave in South Dakota, and Mesa Verde in Colorado. He also made major contributions to the founding of Yellowstone National Park National Park and the Grand Canyon National Park.
His original environmentalism and original conservation included:
* Conservation of natural wonders: parks, monuments and wildlife refuges.
* Conservation is for the people as a whole. Results are not to be reserved for the elite.
* Conservation includes development as much as it does protection, including water power, flood control and land reclamation. ""Water flowing unused to the sea was `wasted'.""
* Corruption must be fought on many fronts including corrupt and unprincipled editors.
TR surely did much good in all of these efforts. Yet some have accused him and his government of going beyond the point of diminishing returns. Over 250 national items, parks, reserves etc, is a huge number. Some of these might have been better left for state or local government, or for free enterprise. However, TR, the father of conservation, clearly loved big government
7. Conclusion. I have noted many areas in this review where more conservation and more environmental protection have been needed. I have also noted that two very well known and highly competent individuals have gone beyond the point of diminishing returns in these fields. However, a balance is needed, and in the ""Valley"", it was not in balance. However, only a tiny bit more could have been tolerated, or the mine would have closed down, which would not be of help to anyone. My thesis in my book is that environmentalists in general tend to go beyond the point of diminishing returns. When they go far beyond this point, where there is no sense of balance in their position, they become ""Gorons.""
At the start of this review I had noted that the ""Valley"" wasn't very green, and got less green as time passed. I would argue that the Gorons also have got less green as time passed. At one time they argued they deserved the whole green spectrum, that is 100 percent. However, I have argued that that is far too broad, that out of a million or so shades of green, perhaps they can only have one shade, or 0.0001 percent.",1297641600,,10577,4.7229437229437226

488362,5,6302640504,"With the strength of a four-hour epic yet the packaging of a two-hour family drama, `How Green Was My Valley' may very well be...perfect.  There are few films that have captured the ability to create something so epic in stroke yet small in frame; so grand in its embrace yet intimate in its structure.  The Academy Award Best Picture winner of 1941 is just that kind of film, and I laud it and will continue to laud it for all times for accomplishing something so masterful and so rare.  Without ever ONCE overstaying its welcome, `How Green Was My Valley' manages to say so much in less time than most epic films.  This is due to John Ford's brilliant direction and his smart construction, always using the most of the elements at his disposal to create something fluid, engaging and memorable.

The film tells of a very close-knit mining family in a small Welsh village.  As economic times weigh heavy on the town this family finds themselves being torn in two by their surroundings.  When the miners go on strike it poses problems for this family, as the patriarch wants no part of it.  The film basically tells nothing more or less than this one family's story of survival in a world very real.

As their story is painted across the rich black and white backdrop (whoever says that black and white film is secondary to color has just seen the WRONG black and white films) we meet every nook and cranny of their extended family, from drinking buddies to employers to village preachers and grade school teachers.  The family suffers from disagreements within their own household (especially with regard to their working situation), from death and sorrow as well as a fair share of scandal (involving a handsome young preacher at that), but it is how this family stays together and actually grows stronger that makes for the most compelling and richly developed story.

Told through the eyes of young (well, old now) Huw, `How Green Was My Valley' is a beautiful tale of youth and family and the wonderful way that memories can create in us a nostalgic look at times past.  Despite all the `hard times' this family (their surname is Morgan by the way) remained together and never lost the love they had in the beginning.

`How Green Was My Valley' is a very reflective piece, exposing the beauty of childhood and the sheer importance of a loving household.

The performances by the ENTIRE cast are spot on, but the Oscar's got it right nominating Donald Crisp and Sara Allgood.  They are the true standouts here, mastering their take on the paternal graces of the Morgan family.  Crisp well deserved the Oscar he received and I applaud the Academy for making such a beautiful choice.  Maureen O'Hara, Walter Pidgeon and young Roddy McDowall are all standouts as well, delivering stunning examples of control and charisma.  O'Hara is stunning in every scene, even when she's merely there in the background, and McDowall has a very strong presence for such a young boy.  Each actor compliments the others around him and they all contribute such delicate strength to the overall effect of Ford's masterpiece.

Some have baulked at this film winning the Best Picture Oscar over the likes of `Citizen Kane', a film that is considered by MANY to be the best American film of all time.  The two films are hardly comparable when you think about it since they are both drastically different in design, scope and subject; but there is no doubt that BOTH films are classics.  I adore them both and consider them to be brilliant portrayals of the `craft' of filmmaking.  Orson Welles was a genius, as was John Ford, and while they each had their own unique and very different style of approaching filmmaking, they both nailed their craft.  I cannot say which film I prefer at the moment, since both are so unique and so marvelously done.  They both also carry a very weighty message (this one being the importance of family and `Kane' being the importance of individuality) and so as wonderful and pristine as each film is, they are also very important films.

See them both; that is all.",1251676800,3,4078,4.716502115655853

488391,5,6302640504,"When plans were being made to turn Richard Llewellyn's 1939 novel ""How Green Was My Valley into a motion picture director John Ford had big ideas.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" was to be a two-reel epic drama shot entirely on location in South Wales in glorious Techincolor.  But the outbreak of World War II intervened and Ford's plans had to be scaled back dramatically.  Instead, ""How Green Was My Valley"" was filmed in California in the hills of Malibu and because the vegetation was markedly different from what one would expect to find in Wales Ford chose to make his film in black and white.  No matter.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" is widely recognized as one of the finest motion pictures ever made.  This is a spellbinding film that grabs your attention from the outset and just never lets go.

""How Green Was My Valley"" features an all-star cast and was nominated for an impressive ten Academy Awards.  The film stars Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Anna Lee, Donald Crisp, Barry Fitzgerald and an inspiring young actor introduced in the opening credits as ""Master"" Roddy McDowell.  The film essentially depicts life in this poor South Wales mining town through the eyes of ten year old Huw Morgan (McDowell).  When Huw was a young boy the mine had just recently opened and as such the landscape around the town was still largely unspoiled.  Over time we begin to see the devastating ecological impact that mining has on a community.  We also gain insight into the extremely difficult, dangerous and dirty work that coal miners are asked to do each and every day.  You will come to understand why the mortality rate is so high among those in this occupation.  In spite of it all these miners are proud of the work that they do.  ""How Green Was My Valley"" also explores the area of labor-management relations,  It would appear that the mine owners are holding all the cards.  When management decides to cut wages it has a devastating impact on families.  In fact, three of young Huw's older brothers make the difficult decision to leave town and seek employment elsewhere.  Huw's parents are heartbroken.  Walter Pidgeon stars as  preacher Mr. Guffydd who is the spiritual leader of the community.  Huw's sister Angharad (Maureen O'Hara) falls for the handsome fellow but much to her dismay Guffydd resists her romantic overtures.  Much like the epic motion picture ""Gone With The Wind"" this film offer viewers a little bit of everything.

For me,  one of  the most impressive things about ""How Green Was My Valley"" was the innovative set that was created for this film.  John Ford certainly succeeded in making me feel like I was a part of all that was going on in this film.  I felt a tremendous amount of empathy for what a great many of these charactors were going through.  Tremendous writing and fine acting all the way around combine to make ""How Green Was My Valley"" a film you do not want to miss.  My wife and I have a stash of favorite films we watch again and again.  You can rest assured that ""How Green Was My Valley"" will be added to that collection.

488392,4,6302640504,"I fully agree with the other enthusiastic reviews, although, having grown up in the Welsh valleys, I probably have a slightly different perspective.  I think Ford captured brilliantly the sense of the very close-knit mining community, and the special bond formed by the men's choir.  The love story struggles a bit, and, while the local phrasing is accurate, the Welsh accents are sometimes questionable (especially Walter Pidgeon's, unfortunately).  The miners' cottages are substantially more spacious than anything I have seen in Cwm Rhondda, with its long lines of slate roofs glistening in the rain, and the countryside has been somewhat ""Brigadooned"", but I suppose this is inevitable Hollywood.  For anyone interested in learning more, I strongly recommend reading Alexander Cordell's ""Rape of the Fair Country"", a brilliant description of life in the valleys.",1233878400,4,867,5.496240601503759

This Best Picture of 1941 has become a classic and deservedly so.  The hard life of the miners contrasts with the warmth of family and neighbors, and the respect and loyalty of the Morgan family is inspiring.  Roddy McDowell is adorable as the youngest in the family; he gives a restrained performance that is sympathetic without being too sweet.  Donald Crisp is perfect as his simple yet wise father.  Maureen O'Hara is lovely as the sister, even though her storyline isn't fully developed or resolved.

This is a sentimental look back at a simpler time, a man's memories of his loving family.  It's quite touching and makes me wish there could be movies made like this today.",1229904000,,950,4.640718562874252

So I can close my eyes on my Valley as it is today - and it is gone - and I see it as it was when I was a boy. Green it was, and possessed of the plenty of the earth. In all Wales, there was none so beautiful."" ~from ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941)

One of my favorite films of all is the John Ford masterpiece ""How Green Was My Valley."" Based upon the novel by Richard Llewellyn, the film follows the travails of a Welsh coal mining family in the late Victorian era, as seen through the eyes of the boy Huw Morgan, played by Roddy McDowall. John Ford had the gift of making every shot into a work of art, using the contrasts of light and shadow, snow and coal dust, sunshine and smoke from the colliery, to tell the tale. As the wages are decreased, and the quality of life declines, the film grows darker.

In the beginning of the film the Morgan family live in thriving simplicity in one of the row houses provided for the miners. The table is laden with food, their basic material needs appear to be met as the father and brothers are able to provide adequately for the family by their labors in the ""colliery."" The Morgans enjoy the support of the close knit community, led by a rather utopian-minded young minister Mr. Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon.) Welsh songs punctuate the film, especially at weddings and other festivities. Life was plain and toilsome but there was magic to be found in the very ordinariness. However, as the industrial revolution churns along, and the greed of the mine owners grow, the wages decrease, there are strikes, the work becomes more laborious and dangerous than ever. The villagers become distrustful of each other; the Morgan family begins to break apart as the sons must leave the Valley to seek employment elsewhere.

The poignant romance between Angharad Morgan, Huw's sister, and Mr. Gruffydd the minister swirls at the center of the drama. Mr. Gruffydd rebuffs Angharad, heartrendingly portrayed by Maureen O'Hara, because he does not want her to have to share his impoverished lifestyle. She marries the mine owner's wealthy stuffed-shirt of a son; the stony expression on Angharad's face at her wedding bodes no good. When she returns to the Valley after being away for some years, the women of the village begin to circulate calumnies about her and Mr. Gruffydd. The fact that Angharad and her lost love have had absolutely no contact with each other does not keep the gossip from besmirching the good name of her entire family. Mr Gruffydd confronts his congregation, rebuking them for their hypocrisy in one of the most scathing film sermons of all time:

  ""Why do you come here? Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black and parade before your God on Sunday? From love? No. For you have shown that your hearts are too withered to receive the love of your Divine Father. I know why you have come - I have seen it in your faces Sunday after Sunday as I've stood here before you. Fear has brought you here. Horrible, superstitious fear. Fear of divine retribution - a bolt of fire from the skies. The vengeance of the Lord and the justice of God. But you have forgotten the love of Jesus. You disregard His sacrifice. Death, fear, flames, horror and black clothes. Hold your meeting then, but know if you do this in the name of God and in the house of God, you blaspheme against Him and His Word.""

After the mine explosion, when Mr. Gruffydd descends into the depths to search for the injured Mr. Morgan, his eyes meet Angharad's; their hands clasp for an instant before he disappears into the pit. Light pierces the clouds, as Mrs. Morgan sees her husband, killed in the accident, in the place of glory. It is then that young Huw, the narrator, says of his father: ""Men like my father cannot die. They are with me still, real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved forever. How green was my valley then.""",1228521600,2,3985,4.511080332409972

One wonders if the idyllic village life was truly that beautiful or if that was the way the author wanted to remember it.  Anyway, realistic or not, it is refreshing to see a tight knit community, in this day of alienation.  I found the singing of the coal miners as they marched to work to be very touching.  Can you imagine marching to work with your friends, singing, in three part harmony?!

Of course bad things happened to mar the happiness and that is part of the human experience.  The story doesn't gloss over the hardships but they are all met with such heroism that one is heartened to see them.  Truly these folks were not trivialized by watching too much Seinfeld.

The cast is perfect.  I had never seen Roddy McDowell as a child and was amazed at his flawless performance.  Obviously John Ford had a way with actors.  He loved them, (the Special Features says) and it shows.  There is a natural innocence to all of them.  Maureen O'Hara was fresh over from Ireland and in full beauty.  Walter Pidgeon is the embodiment of strength, charm and integrity as the parson.  (No wonder the O'Hara character fell for him!)  Donald Crisp certainly deserved the Oscar he won for his performance as the father!  Anna Lee as the big bosomed mother who has her own strength and humor is impressive, too.  She makes
you realize what it is to be a mother--to bring babies into the world, only to lose them.

There is a political theme, of the exploitation of the workers by the mine owners and the necessity for the formation of unions.  But the human drama is the main focus of the film and one isn't oppressed by dreary polemics.  There is a bit of preaching by the preacher when an unwed mother is castigated by the church folks, but it is certainly deserved and, again, it isn't too much.

The film was made at the time when America was about to enter WWII and the audience was ready for such a hearty and comforting tale about human strength in the face of adversity.  But it is, like all fine works of art, a film that has something for all of us at any time.  Basic human values and virtues never go out of style.",1206144000,,2291,4.397619047619048

So it was with some considerable anticipation that I sat down to enjoy this DVD. Yet I had to wonder which valley they are talking about. Having some familiarity with the South Wales coalpits area, I could not believe how unlike Wales the setting is. Just shoving a feeble impression of a coal mine on a hill gives no indications of what Wales is like. Nor does a group of guys bursting into song every five minutes.

If the setting is hopeless, the attempts at Welsh accents are worse. We have an intriguing mixture of mainly Irish, sometimes American dialects. The adaptation is hopeless; just picking odd scenes from the book with no continuity results in a disjointed and hesitant screenplay with no flow at all. I love old films but this one is as bad as it gets. Did it really beat Citizen Kane to those Oscars? I give it 2 stars to compensate for Roddy McDowall's excellent performance. The rest of the cast, including the very American looking and sounding Miss O'Hara, you could give away with a lucky bag.",1185926400,7,1121,4.577114427860696
488436,5,6302640504,"Released in 1941, based on the popular novel by Richard Llewellyn, the legendary director, John Ford, known more for his innovative Western films, brought a little 19th century Welsh town to life during a time of harsh transition from an idyllic rural setting to the callous reality of the sudden onslaught of the Industrial Revolution. This may be the historic backdrop to this story, but it more concerns the memory of a man sentimentally harking back to his family of hard working coal miners and those basic values of love, family loyalty and the at times cruelty of life in general. The tale is told by the protagonist, Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowall), though is narrated by an adult voice, which unfortunately, the credits of the film have left anonymous. That said, there is something extraordinary about this story and I believe it is the notion of a close-knit family, sticking together, no matter what may be thrown their way.

Roddy McDowall was an exceptional child actor. The utter sensitivity and innocence in his expressions reveal a boy of truly great talent.

One of the most memorable scenes is Huw's first day at school. The teacher played with authentic sadism, Mr. Jonas (Morton Lowry) brought back images of my early school days: bully students and bully teachers. Little Huw is humiliated in front of the class because of his lowly status in the community. During recess, the boy's bully him further leading to a fight on the playground. Huw is of course blamed and given a sadistic whipping with a yard stick with relish from Mr. Jonas. The boy staggers home and father and his brother's discover the truth and pay a visit to the school. After this encounter, it is possible that Mr. Jonas will think twice about cruelly hurting a ""Morgan"" boy or any other child for that matter.

The dialogue in this 40's film is also superb, for example, Walter Pidgeon as Mr. Gruffydd, when poor Hue is laid up sick:

""You've been lucky, Huw. Lucky to suffer and lucky to spend these weary months in bed. For so God has given you a chance to make the spirit within yourself. And as your father cleans his lamp to have good light, so keep clean your spirit... By prayer, Huw. And by prayer, I don't mean shouting, mumbling, and wallowing like a hog in religious sentiment. Prayer is only another name for good, clean, direct thinking. When you pray, think. Think well what you're saying. Make your thoughts into things that are solid. In that way, your prayer will have strength, and that strength will become a part of you, body, mind, and spirit.""

One of the most memorable passages of the film.

How Green Was My Valley gave us a glimpse into this Welsh community and the trials and basic day to day hardships of the period with realism, pathos and a pinch of lament... and that so-called simplicity in our modern era could well be lost.

488441,5,6302640504,"How Green was my Valley is a tale of the joys and hardships (mostly hardships) experienced by a mining community in the Welsh Valleys in the late Victorian era.

The story centres on the Morgan family, an archetypal Welsh mining family consisting of a strict but loving (in his own way), father, a subserviant but nevertheless strong-willed wife and mother, many strong sons and the ubiquitous semi-servile daughter but still with a mind of her own, and of course, a far younger son, the baby of the family.

On first viewing, anyone who does not know the director, will soon know it is John Ford by the classic Fordesque characteristics screaming out at them. In fact, it could be said to be the pre-cursor to his even more lauded The Quiet Man, made some years later.

Taking both films together, it is obvious that Ford could and did utilise to maximum effect the characteristics and foibles we all rightly or wrongly associate with the two communities featured, both Gaelic, and both alien to, and alienated by their current or former Masters in Whitehall. But Ford does this magnificently across the two films as he does have to highlight the differences. With this film, he glories in the work-ethic heavy, dour, chapel influenced life of the Welsh at that time, with what humour there is very sparse in contrast to the rain, grime and coal dust tinged production for the most part. Later, in The Quiet Man, he had to turn this on its head and portray the work undertaken by those featured to be nothing but a vehicle for enjoying life to the full once the hooter went. Whether Ford believed fully in these sterotypes is hard to say, but whether he did or not, let us be thankful how he knew to best maximise both blarney and misery to bring us two great films.

Before I return to this film alone, I would like to add that although circumstance at the outset, his casting of several of the same people from the 'stable' in both films, cultural differences in the stories notwithstanding, was an act of sheer genius.

So, I've digressed enough. The plot of How Green was my Valley is heavily dependent on the fact that the Establishment virtually owned people; I know people would say 'what's the difference now?', well, maybe they are right, but in this era, in this place, it was more evident than most other places of any era. Despite this, the film is not overtly party political as many people mistakenly believe, but it does in part act as social comment, with the Establishment manifesting itself in the all powerful mine and mine owners; and in this region in this era shows them as only too willing to take advantage of the strong work ethic of the family Patriarch, who will not sanction action despite suffering greatly at the hands of his employers.

Now, I have to disagree with another reviewer who said that Ford cleverly kept the film devoid of Pathos and over-emotion. Well, there are some scenes that I think lessen the film, and these are when the whole village gather at the family's gate with a song in store, for anything from someone from the Morgan's breaking wind, to getting wed, this lacks logic and will scream out at you the first time you see this.

One other thing of note, the mining scenes are brilliant, and capture the conditions, frequently dangerous ones. You feel as if you are there, getting blackened, soaked and at times chilled to the bone. And, gate-gathering not withstanding, the miners' choir will have you wanting to sing Bread of Heaven as loud as you can on the mearest hill side you can find. All in all, a great, great film, if you haven't seen this, then do so.",1167523200,,3619,4.6102484472049685

In particular, I was fascinated to see Walter Pigeon playing the role of a preacher with a romantic interest.  I've always thought of him as the mad scientist in Forbidden Planet, and the mad captain of the Seaview in the original Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.  I love Walter Pigeon, and the speech his character gives to his congregation toward the end is priceless.

488470,5,6302640504,"Richard Llewellyn's poignant, nostalgic novel ""How Green Was My Valley"" appeared in 1939.  Hollywood was quick to work on a film adaptation, requiring a top director and producer, the recreation of a Welsh mining village in California, assembling a Welsh male choir and all the other essential requirements.  Its success might be measured by the swag of academy awards and nominations it received, triumphing over such contenders for best picture as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"".

There is an appeal to the heart here.  Homely, sturdy values and speech idioms of long ago are displayed in their best light.  There is also an appeal to the mind.  Political issues are examined, as are the effects of capitalization, worker exploitation and unionism.

Because a reading of the book and a viewing of the film have always moved me deeply, I have avoided them for many years.  I recently watched the DVD version however, and can report that the DVD remastering has been completely successful.  Although 1941 was a good year for cinematography, sound track quality was far from satisfactory.  Some slight enhancing has been done here to render the choral singing and orchestral sound at least tolerable.  Dialogue is clear.

The film immortalizes the work of veteran actors Donald Crisp and Sara Allgood, who play the parts of Gwillym and Beth Morgan, the parents of the mining family.  It also best shows the child acting talent of Roddy McDowell, then aged 13.  And it is Irving Pinchel who provides the unforgettable narration.",1132531200,11,1535,5.0396825396825395

The story is set in Cywm Rhonda, the famed Welsh coal mining valley.  Despite the gorgeous cinematography and a soundtrack just full of fabulous Welsh men's choral singing, ""How Green Was My Valley"" is a real tear jerker, almost infinitely sad.  No good milestone in young Huw's life is untouched by grief.

488473,4,6302640504,"I admit to having put off watching this film for some time, and only did so finally as ""homework"".  Given that background, I was pleasantly surprised by How Green Was My Valley.  On the plus side, I was totally blown away by the realistic look of the 19th century Welsh mining town (recreated right in the hills of Malibu!).  To my utter surprise, the sets looked absolutely convincing throughout.  Roddy McDowell, so uncharismatic as an adult, is fairly benign here as a youth, and his screen time is mercifully inconsistent.  Donald Crisp (born in 1880) gives the standout performance as the Morgan family patriarch.  While some might find this dated, my favorite part was when he called the organization of a union ""socialism"" and ended the entire conversation.  Ford loved to evoke such old-fashioned Victorian morality, which although severely out of favor since around 1914, was the dominant worldview during the 19th century, the setting of so many of his films.  This authenticity, despite however ""dated"" it may feel to us today, is one of the things which imparts such relevance to his films.

On the less than positive side, however, I must admit that Maureen O'Hara's acting was frequently terrible.  She sounded like an undereducated American girl only half-trying to work a British accent.  And Walter Pidgeon (aren't appellations like that what prompted the whole idea of stage-names in the first place?), despite an otherwise good performance, didn't even try to sound English, let alone Welsh.  For heaven's sake, he didn't even sound Canadian!  As for the story, while it had some wonderful moments, it could also be dull and unengaging.  And Ford's characteristic preachiness occasionally showed up, as sure and as welcome as a drunken and disorderly uncle over the holidays.  Finally, to me the ending felt a little contrived.

My recommendation: By all means see this film for yourself.  Ford's marvelous tableaux images of the mine over the village alone merit at least one viewing. But I do feel it's primarily for diehard fans of 1940s cinema, readers of the novel, or the John Ford faithful.  How Green Was My Valley is not a bad movie at all, it's just not a truly great one.",1094947200,,2201,4.934782608695652
488474,5,6302640504,"""How Green Was My Valley"" is one of John Ford's best films, the sentimental story of the Morgans, a family of Welsh coal miners.  Adapted by screenwriter Philip Dunne from Richard Llewellyn's best-selling novel, this is the story of a close-knit, hard-working family at the turn of the last century that sees its livelihood at the mine start to slip away and the family starts to fall apart.  The story is told in flash back by the youngest boy, Huw (Roddy McDowall, with the actual narration by Irving Pichel), who wants to grow up to be just like his father (Donald Crisp, in his Oscar winning role) and older brothers, at a time when that way of life is no longer viable.
This is a gloriously beautiful black and white film, with several foundations for that beauty.  First, there is the Oscar winning set design of Richard Day, Nathan Juran and Thomas Little, who recreated a totally believable Welsh town on the side the Santa Monica Mountains at Brent's Crags, near Malibu (plans to film the movie in Wales were abandoned when World War II broke out).  This is one of the most memorable built sets in Hollywood history.  Second, there is the Oscar winning photography of Arthur C. Miller, who would go on to win Oscars for cinematography of ""Song of Bernadette"" and ""Anna and the King of Siam.""  Third, there is the singing of the Welsh Singers, who set the tone during the opening credits of the film (the same song that is song in a great moment in ""Zulu,"" except this time it is sung in Welsh).  Fourth, there is the young Irish actress Maureen O'Hara as the one daughter in the Morgan household.  The only regret that this film is not in color comes from being denied the sight of O'Hara's red hair.
Beyond director Ford, who also won an Oscar, the key to this film becomes McDowell in terms of both his character and his performance.  Huw is the character that brings the various episodes and plot threads together, and despite the deaths and departures that come during the film, the greatest tragedy in the film belongs to Huw.  McDowell's simple and earnest performance is indeed the lynch pin of the film.  The socio-political tone of the novel with regards to the labor union issue is toned down considerably, although the harsh realities faced by these Welsh coal miners are clearly represented.
""How Green Was My Valley"" was the film that beat out ""Citizen Kane"" for the Academy Award for Best Picture (not to mention ""The Maltese Falcon"" and seven other films), although if you know the story of Orson Welles' masterpiece then you really have to be surprised the film was nominated (I bet it would not have been if there had been only five nominations allowed).

I was sure I would be bored with this movie.  Was I ever wrong.  This movie touches you in every way.  It is quite possibly the saddest and most emotional movie I've ever seen.  The cast is very solid: Maureen O'Hara, Anna Lee, Walter Pidgeon, and Roddy McDowall.  There is something special about How Green Was My Valley that I cannot explain.  I am glad it won Best Picture at the Oscars in 1941.  I hope nobody tries to remake this film because no actor or director could do a better job.

488486,5,6302640504,"Frankly, I had forgotten how excellent this film is until seeing it again recently. (It received the Academy Award for best film in 1941in competition with Citizen Kane and the other nominees.) The impact on me of a film at a given time is almost wholly dependent on how accessible I am when seeing it. I first saw How Green Was My Valley as a child and then again several years later. Probably because since then I have become a father and then a grandfather, I am much more appreciative now than I was before of what director John Ford achieves in his portrayal of a Welsh mining town and of a specific family there which struggles so courageously to enable one of its own, not only to escape from the mines but from the limits of a culture (albeit loving and supportive) to fulfill his human potentialities which would otherwise be denied. The film covers a 50-year period as an adult Huw Morgan recalls it (he is played by Roddy McDowell), with the primary focus on his ordeals as the youngest of several children. Donald Crisp received an Academy Award as best actor in a supporting role as Morgan family's patriarch. Many believe this is Ford's best film and I would be hard-pressed to disagree with them. It really has everything. With Philip Dunne's screenplay based on Richard Llewellyn's novel, How Green Was My Valley combines superior acting and cinematography with Alfred Newman's complementary musical score. For me, this film's greatness is found in its graphic portrayal of hardship and despair in a bleak mining town which are offset by a proud family's enduring faith in Huw and their determination to protect and support him. Ford affirms their essential dignity with a respect and admiration he invites us to share.",1065744000,62,1735,4.767441860465116

A young Roddy McDowell sees his family go though loss, redemption, hatred and love.  If nothing else, the movie shows the strength of th family and in particular the English people.
An outstanding cast almost makes you feel like you are in old Wales.  You can almost feel the coal dust on your tongue as you watch the miners traverse the dangerous coal mines.  You can feel the suffering and the happiness of the family as they deal with trajedies and triumphs.  Watch it-one of the greatest movies of all time!",1061942400,3,641,4.482758620689655

""All About Eve"", ""Gentlemen's Agreement"", ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"", ""An Affair to Remember"" all qualify for this offer.
""How Green Was My Valley"" is not a happy, feel-good movie.  It is about many different tragedies that befall a family in Wales.  It is poignant, touching, a masterpiece from one of the great directors of all time.",1056931200,,665,4.593220338983051
488489,5,6302640504,"Welsh Author Richard Llewellyn's classic (1940), in 1941 won an Oscar at the Academy Awards over 'Citizen Kane' for Best Picture. Also to recieve an award for Best Supporting Actor, Donald Crisp and Best Director, John Ford. Ford had previously won an Academy Award for Best Director in 1935 for 'The Informer' and in 1940 for 'The Grapes of Wrath.' With this track record it a wonder that the 1941 film's success claimed all the awards at the Oscars. Ford went on later to capture again the Best Director category in 1952 for 'The Quiet Man.'

Most movie-goers and critics who have seen both, 'Citizen Kane' and 'How Green Was My Valley' in comparation choose 'Citizen Kane' as the greatest American film in movie history. According to the American Film Institute (AFI) had been selected as one of the top 100 films of all time. Was it such a disappointment at the 1941 Oscars that left 'Citizen Kane' empty-handed in it's artistic achievement? Concerning at the time the approach of the film's story and Orson Welles are not to go unnoticed. The differences that probably considered at the time, that 'Citizen Kane' approach was a more documentary-type looking at the life of a newspaper mogul. Whereas, 'How Green Was My Valley' is a narrative look at one Welsh family seen through the eyes of the 10-year-old son. My guess that's what the public can relate to more of family values at a time in the early 40s just after the Great Depression and the beginning of World War II. That's what 'The Grapes of Wrath' did. It related to real people the same as 'How Green Was My Valley.' Maybe 'Citizen Kane' in some public's point-of-view at that time left a bad taste in their mouth. Or, maybe we can all just relate more in our life experiences. Isn't that what life and art is all about? If you've read Llewellyn's book you can hear the Welsh speak and the events that affect the Morgan family like that of a soap opera. The same is geniously done in the film.

Ford does a beautiful job creating this memorable drama about a loving, spiritual Welsh family of coal miners. It's gentle portrayal well deserves it's reward in this coming-of-age story in the best and worst times that hold a family together. A true masterpiece, that Hollywood could use as an example in their film notebooks of how a great film is made. There's a great cast that makes a great movie. There's plenty here. The story focuses on the events as seen through the eyes of 10 year old Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowell). His father and mother (Donald Crisp and Sarah Allgood) and five other brothers has seen the best and worst times when tensions of a miner's union causes some turmoil between the Morgan family members and the other villagers as they begin a long strike. Huw Morgan also learns the tougher side of life under the guardianship of local preacher, Mr. Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon). Mr. Gruffydd has also developed permanent affections towards Huw's sister, Angharad (Maureen O'Hara). Crises arise throughout the film, like the cruel schoolmaster, the bully and the unfortunate accident of a fall causing Hwu to lose the use of his legs are endured. Even when the family are separated because of change or tragic loss the story just unfolds into a moving, lush family portrait of durable strength and sound morals. It was a time that was simple and innocent. The fondness of memory and the journey from childhood to adulthood we all have in common. Such a beautiful classic to cherish. If you like to read more about Richard Llewellyn's work try, 'None But the Lonely Heart.' You may also enjoy in the same gnere as this film, 'The Corn is Green' with Bette Davis.",1056672000,2,3642,4.6890625
488490,5,6302640504,"""How Green Was My Valley"" is a rare, quality entry into that classic genre, the movie that is an unfettered, sentimental love letter to ""days gone by.""  This particular Brigadoon is a small Welsh mining town, where every cause is righteous , where money corrupts and the very poorest have the purest of hearts and where the salt of the Earth earn their keep by digging deep in the coal mines.
If you are in the mood for it, if you can check you modern cynicism at the door, ""How Green Was My Valley"" is an excellent film.  John Ford (The Searchers, The Quiet Man) is a master director,  and creates an incredible authenticity of feeling and homesickness, especially for a man born in Maine.  Young Roddy McDowall is a feisty Huw Morgan, and Maureen O'Hara is the tragic beauty Angharad Morgan.  The film presents some interesting lessons on church morality, poverty and fighting back, though not always in the way expected.

488491,3,6302640504,"""How Green Was My Valley"" is a story about the celebration and disillusionment of family.  It takes place in a Welsh mining town (actually a Twentieth Century-Fox set built in California) and centers on the Morgan family, mum, dad and five adult sons and one child, played brilliantly by Roddy McDowell.  The whole story is seen through McDowell's eyes. Director John Ford cuts a masterful swath in telling this tale.  Maureen O'Hara and Walter Pigeon, as the ill-fated lovers, are superb.  Donald Crisp and Sara Allgoode are brilliant as the elders of the Morgan clan.  This is a wonderful, timeless film to share with your family and friends.  A genuine classic in every sense.
The transfer from Fox is pretty much the same as the previously issued DVD.  Contrast levels seema bit low at times but the black and white picture is pretty much pristine, especially when it comes to the stunning close ups.  The remixed soundtrack is a bit too aggresive in its side channel output, often drowning out the more soft spoken bits of dialogue with music.  Not to worry.  The film's original mono audio is also included and it is properly balanced.  Dialogue, though dated in fidelity is nevertheless well represented.  On this incarnation we get a documentary on the making of the movie that is all too brief and some theatrical trailers that don't  add anything to the enjoyment of the over-all film experience.  BOTTOM LINE:  If you have the previously issued DVD you might want to think twice before going out and rebuying this title again.  The extras aren't worth it.",1049155200,19,1566,4.830827067669173
488492,4,6302640504,"John Ford's 1941 film How Green Was My Valley tells the story of a Welsh mining family, the Morgans, through the eyes of the youngest member of the family, ten-year old Huw (Roddy McDowell).  Mr. & Mrs. Morgan (Donald Crisp & Sara Allgood) have seven children and struggle to keep their family afloat.  Mr. Morgan is a miner, but he refuses to join a newly formed union and join in on their strike.  This creates tensions within the family and violence erupts.  Through it all the family survives, but their hometown and culture begin to decline.  Mr. Ford poignantly portrays the fading of childhood innocence and the good side and down side of life in a small town.  The film is still relevant today as Mr. Ford shows how technology dehumanizes society as machinery that is more efficient and cost-effective starts to replace many of the mine's best workers and renders them unneeded and forces them into unemployment.  The film beat out what is considered the greatest movie of time, Citizen Kane, to win the 1941 Academy Award for Best Picture and Mr. Ford beat Orson Welles to win his second consecutive Best Director Award (and the third of his total of four).  The film won three other Oscars including Best Supporting Actor for Mr. Crisp.  The film was to be shot in color on location in Wales, but due to the escalation of World War II, filming was moved to California and shot in black & white to help create the dreariness of South Wales.  This worked out brilliantly as the lack of color helps create more a bleaker mood and Arthur C. Miller was rewarded with an Oscar for Best Cinematography.",1045785600,111,1605,4.639575971731449

488494,5,6302640504,"There is a genre of films whose underlying theme is the continuity of the family.  In such movies, the family unit is placed at the dramatic center, often facing challenges from the external world that threaten the solidarity of its internal cohesiveness.  Such a film is HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, which traces the evolution of one middle class Welsh family over a period of many years.  The narrator is an adult whose memories of his youth form the basis of the film.  Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowell) recalls his life beginning when he was about thirteen.  What he sees and relates is not only the changes that his family goes through, but he also notes the symbiotic interaction that society has on them.  At the start of the movie, life for the Morgan family is pleasant.  The family unit is cohesive, loving, and disciplined.  His father Gwilym (Donald Crisp) controls them with a stern but loving hand.  His mother Beth (Sara Allgood) is the loving mother who seems to spend most of her time as an eternal washerwoman.  He has five older brothers and a sister Angharad (Maureen O'Hara), who silently loves the unapproachable village vicar Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon).  Soon enough, a changing society exerts a corrosive effect on the Morgans.  The villain is not any one person, although the mine owner has been unfairly castigated for that.  Rather, the creeping evil is a changing society that slowly is evolving from an agricultural base to a mechanized one.  Workers at the mine are being downsized so they strike, and this strike sets is motion other wheels which further flatten the once strong solidarity of the Morgan family.  The Morgan sons quarrel with the father over the strike and move out of the house.  The daughter Angharad loves the vicar Gruffydd, who must reject her because of his clerical collar, so she is pressured into a loveless marriage with another.  And there are several tragic accidents at the mine that are fatal for some of the male Morgans.  While all this is going on, Huw sees the changes and feels the pain of their consequences.  His schooling is a disaster as he is beaten mercilessly with a cane by his teacher.  He suffers but does not know how to reconcile his suffering with the words of patience doled out by the vicar. There is no traditional happy ending, except that some of the Morgan family adjust to changes in their macrocosmic and microcosmic universe.  Huw hears the words of endurance and tries to live by their meaning. At the end of the film, Huw is now an adult, with an adult's vision, but it is not clear if the joy he feels at the telling of his story is the joy only of joyous memories or the clarity of vision that his youthful pentitences have so painfully taught him.
  HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY was a deserved winner of an Oscar for Best Picture.  Donald Crisp won Best Suporting Actor for his role of the crochety but understanding Gwilym Morgan. What this movie suggests is that the inspiration one needs to overcome adversity need not be found only in the wisdom of others.  Sometimes, it can be found within one's own heart.

Five of the six sons work in the mine alongside the father.  All get good wages and there is plenty of food on the table.  The townspeople even have a choir and there is singing throughout.  The sixth son, a child, played by Roddy McDowall who was then 13 years old, narrates the story as events change their lives.  He observes his brother's marriage, a strike at the mine, the unrequited love of his sister, played by a youthful Maureen O'Hara with the Minister, Walter Pidgeon, and some terrible mine accidents.  Donald Crisp plays the father and Sara Allgood the mother and I could easily sympathize with the joys and trials of holding their large family together.
As this film was adapted from a novel, it was packed with many episodes, not all of which were fully developed.  However, there was enough to hold my interest throughout.  Filmed in black and white without any of today's special effects, the cinematographers did an excellent job of depicting the small town as well as the work inside of a coal mine.  While watching the video I couldn't help thinking about the particular changes that time has brought to the movies.  Specifically I thought about the actors, most of them now dead or elderly and the power of film to capture them in time. I personally felt a distance from this film. My emotions stayed restricted to analyzing the actor's performances and thinking about how the film was made.  Perhaps the story was a bit too sentimental for my tastes, but I never really got caught up in it.  So even though this is a fine film, I don't know if it has stood the test of time well.

He comes off as an effete wimp, and as he becomes older in the book he continues to look like a 12 year old.  Someone needed to switch him out with an older actor when the story demands it.  In the absence of that a classic movie became only mediocre in my eyes.  But there is good, is the book.",1512604800,,421,4.2125

Here are the hard working Welsh,  dying in coal mines,  trying to start a union.  they wash after work,  they eat big meals,  they sing,  they fight and some of them die in the coal mine.  A sad love between a preacher
and a woman whom he will not pursue takes us away from the happy childhood played by Roddy McDowell in his first and best film.  he was a darling child but he grew up to be kind of creepy looking.  Joy and Sorrow.  whole lives lived in the coarse of the movie.",1510876800,,553,4.065420560747664
