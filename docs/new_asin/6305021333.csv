Travolta and Walters are great, and walters really brings the music to life and makes it seem realistic, like neone could play the way he plays. It was a good movie, and is worth watching",1040774400,4,249,4.1020408163265305
954711,2,6305021333,"Don't expect any life changing experiences from watching this piece of cinematic fluff.  Shout is banal, historically innaccurate and very predictable.  So what.  Not every movie needs to reveal some hidden truth or angst.
OK, so why two stars? The cast is very good, really a waste considering the script.  Travolta gets top billing but the movie is really a vehicle for then teen heart-throbs Jamie Walters and Heather Graham.  Predictable emotionally mixed-up bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks sets out to seduce the headmaster/warden's beautiful daughter for a bet.  She's falls for him, someone spills the beans on the bet, she gets mad but he finally exposes his sensitive and vulnerable side, confesses that he has fallen in love with her, too...what tripe!  The script doesn't make any exceesive demands on their acting abilities.  But, who cares!  Heather Graham is a babe worth watching.
Who ever did the shooting/directing of the movie knows their craft.  The photography is excellent through out.  The movie has that slick, deeply saturated color look...lot's of nice atmospheric shots with with simply perfect lighting.  Add in the attractive cast and you have eye candy that is easy to enjoy.
My reaction to Shout reminds me of listening to Abba songs.  So easy to pan and forget, yet a guilty pleasure to enjoy.",1039219200,6,1334,4.981900452488688
954712,1,6305021333,"The only reason I continued to watch this movie was to see whether or not it would get worse. It did, much to my amusement. Not only is the movie historically inaccurate, but it paints a false picture of life in the 1950s. That the movie takes place in a dry, dusty part of Texas makes it seem as if ""yes, life was really rotten back in these days.""
The story celebrates a troubled youth (Jamie Walters) embracing rock 'n roll as a new music. Fine, but why trash every institution in sight? The Boys Home, for instance . . . this movie makes it look like a prison. And the town sheriff . . . as if all local police officers back then were mean, nasty white guys out to get somebody. (...)
The only bright spot in the film is watching a young Heather Graham and Gwyneth Paltrow make early film career debuts. Travolta looks lost (the film was made in 1991, before his film career resurrection in 1994's Pulp Fiction). Jamie Walters strangely plays the exact same role as his character Ray in Beverly Hills 90210.
I won't recommend that you not watch this film, just for the reason that it's so bad that you might actually get a kick, or a shout, out of it.",976752000,6,1155,4.2785388127853885

The star studded cast did a great job of portraying the effect that freedom of music can have on self esteem, personality, and friendship. I feel that  the movie also shows that it is good to stand in the face of adversity.  Simplistic in it's storyline, it was easy to watch and heart touching.  Bravo!",948067200,,376,4.666666666666667

954784,2,6305021333,"Shout (Jeffrey Hornaday, 1991)

It should say something about my reaction to this film that what I find most amusing about it is that a guy named Hornaday directed a movie about a music teacher and his charges. And that is the best thing about this otherwise generic, Lifetime Original Movie-bait inspirational romance claptrap, one of the movies John Travolta made during the long lull in his career between Blow Out and Pulp Fiction, presumably because he needed the money. It could have, should have, been Travolta's return to the musical-comedy roots that had made him a household name almost fifteen years previously, except, well, pity about the script. The only reason this movie is still remembered, and still available, is that it was the film debut of a young actress by the name of Gwyneth Paltrow.

The film, set in Texas in 1955, concerns the youths who inhabit a boys' home, technically an orphanage but run more like a reform school, with the sadistic Eugene Benedict (Logan's Run's Richard Jordan) at its head. The boys' home has a new charge, a dissolute rabble-rouser named Jesse Tucker (The Heights' Jamie Walters; he may be best-remembered as the lead vocalist on the show's theme song, How Do You Talk to an Angel?, a top 40 hit in 1992) who seems destined for life in prison. Adding to the chaos are two events that happen simultaneouslyBenedict's daughter Sara (From Hell's Heather Graham) comes home from college for summer break, and Benedict hires a new music teacher, Jack Cabe (Travolta), to whip the school band into shape for their annual performance at the town's Fourth of July shindig. The two kids, obviously, take a shine to one another immediately, though in true genre-romance-novel form, there must be many mishaps on the road to jumping between the sheets, while Cabe finds himself attracted to the sexy sister (The Last Seduction's Linda Fiorentino) of one of the local redneck constabulary. Which is doubly troubling, because Cabe is a fan of that new-fangled bop stuff that really doesn't play well in racist Texasunless, it seems, you are an inmate in a boys' home, because once the kids hear it playing from his room at night, they beg him to drop Benedict's curriculum and teach them that stuff.

Ah, the inspiration, it bleeds. In hindsight, there are some really interesting choices here. Linda Fiorentino, especially, before getting typecast in her post-Last Seduction hard-[censored for Amazon consumption] roles, is a breath of fresh air. (Paltrow, by the way, has a minor role as a girls'-school love interest for one of the other boys' home inmates.) Unfortunately, the principals are all phoning it in, especially Walters; he's trying to do his best James Dean, and here, at least, he's too young to realize that often imitated, never duplicated isn't a crock. There are certainly flashes of Grease-era Travolta, especially in one early scene when he breaks into an improvised song while good-naturedly taunting Jesse, who's working off punishment for one of his many infractions by digging a ditch. That scene, that single scene, gave me some hope that this movie might decide to drop the predictability, the inspirational nonsense, blah blah blah, and turn this into a good old musical fantasy romp Xanadu style. Hopes that, unfortunately, were dashed with every minute of film that unspooled after that. **",1394323200,,3362,5.0

954788,5,6305021333,"This movie gets five stars.  While this story line has been ""done"" a millions times, the actors are all top notch.  And yes, the acting is a bit dramatic but that's the genre, and I love it in this film.  But, maybe, just maybe, it's the music that puts it over the top.  I am buying a copy of this for my collection right now.  If anyone has a legal copy of the soundtrack, I'm looking!  btw - lots of kissing and suggestions but no foul language that I can remember.",1336953600,2,468,4.087912087912088
