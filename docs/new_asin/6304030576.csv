7859096,5,6304030576,"I bought this video tape last summer at a yard sale.  My son was only 16 months at the time.  Now he is 21 months and absolutely loves this video.  He loves the music and constant changes of the animals.  I think the narration is fairly decent.  It's definately geared towards smaller children, probably 5 and under.
I got online to see if I could purchase other videos within this series.  Way to Go Sony!",1012694400,,406,4.346666666666667
