3964746,2,B002PLPQME,"Ok, before you go believing all the hooplah about how ""comedic"" Judd Apatow's newest film is, just know that this is nowhere near a real comedy as it is a drama. Maybe a dramedy with very little comedy.
The film stars Adam Sandler as the famous and super-rich George Simmons, a famous comedian who's of older middle-age, still single, sleazy, and completely self-serving. This is a departure for Sandler who usually portays the poor and noble slobbish nice guy in previous films. Anyway, Simmons learns early on that he has a form of Leukemia that will lead to his eventual death, so he decides to keep the news undisclosed to the media and hires a struggling stand-up comedic, Ira Wright (Seth Rogan) to write Simmons some material for a Myspace.com show, later on keeping him hired to be more of a friend than anything else - being rich and famous for Simmons may lead to plenty of money and sleeping with pretty much whatever woman he wants, but as is usually the case, this is not enough to lead to lasting happiness. No, THAT happiness he tries to recover with his former girlfriend Laura (Leslie Mann) who happens to now be married to an australian businessman played by Eric Bana, and also has 2 daughters. Wright (Rogan) lives in a studio apartment in LA along with his two roomates, also up-and-coming comedians Mark Jackson (Jason Schwartzman) and Leo Koenig (Jonah Hill) who are pretty much worthless characters who come off as nothing more than obnoxious jerks who are also so self-focused you wonder how Wright can continue to live with them. I swear, the thought that people actually live and think this way is both ridiculously saddening and discouraging. I kept thinking throughout that if these are the types of poeple America idols, this country is in seriously bad shape.

ok, the film pretty much plays (or drags really) on until the climax where Simmons and his hired friend Wright go to visit his ex and try to make something happen. This intermixed with his illness you'd think that Simmons would try and live his life better and turn a better cheek. But disgustingly enough, he still remains the same, if not worse. Writer Apatow ignores a chance to show that humanity can be both hopeful and appreciated. Anyway, of course later (and this is not a spoiler considering it's been advertised to contain this) Simmons finds out that he actually is not sick anymore because his doctor gives him a clean bill of health and that the illness has ""been beaten."" Anyway, the only reason I describe the plot until this far is because the movie doesn't actually become somewhat interesting until the last 1/2 hour or 40 minutes, when Simmons and Wright visit the ""girl that got away,"" Laura (who shall I say is also completely uncharming and a gross example of what women in this country have become - are children or marriage not even valued anymore??). The conflict between the 4 at the end couldn't have been done without background and characterization first, but there MUST have been a better way for Apatow to do this without dragging the audience thruogh almost 2 hours of overlong uncomedic and bland dialogue, constant obnoxious and unnecessarily perverted language, and characters so pathetically immature you wonder when anyone in this movie will ever just GROW UP and STOP acting like a bunch of selfish smart-alec whiny teenagers and drunken college students. I'm so glad I don't have any friends like this.

Apatow uses his usual brand of ""subtle contemporary-pop humor"" to try and sneak in laughs, but in the end Apatow once again proves that constant F-bombs and references to people's gentials does not make for good or creative comedy, just a sad showing of what sick values poeple, especially rich people, in this society who have never really labored for their wealth hold. Somehow and beyond my knowledge this writer became famous from movies with more comedic flair like the 40-yr Old Virgin and SuperBad and yet still can churn out such garbage such as Funny People and still recieve admiration - it seems a writer can get to a point of fame where they cross a certain ""point of no return"" line and can practically defecate into a paper bag, film it for 2 hours and it'll recieve raving reviews from equally stupid critics. Do any of these people in Hollywood live in REAL life? I don't think so, and it's plainly seen in this overlong and cocky movie that's just plain ol' full of itself.

Wright (Rogan) seems the only one in this entire movie who holds some redeeming character quality (he's the only one I actually liked), as he tries to thoughtfully put things back into prospective to a bunch of disgusting, selfish and whiny characters (not ironically, he's the only one in this movie who actually WORKS for a living), even though he himself comes off as just an insecure moron with crappy taste in women. Still, he seems the only one raised with some sort of values, sentiment and human compassion. If it wasn't for him, I probably would've walked out of this film way before it ended. As for the rest of the cast, if they had all been stricken by some disease and die it would probably bring improvement to the world. Even if you're the type that proudly thinks you're not offended by anything, you'd probably still be turned off by this - no matter what you value, as a human you just know the encouraged actions of ALL the characters in this movie are dead wrong.

Judd Apatow, you're not bringing anything productive to film or art anymore (you hardly ever did), just more horrible values and disgusting recycled garbage. It seems the creme-de-la-creme famous rich people of our society can do whatever they want as long as they hide it behind emo haircuts, quick-witted smart-alec humor, Armani suits, and pop-referenced dialogue.... and the average schmuck will continue to envy it, pay overpriced movie tickets, fake laugh throughout a 2 hour jerk-fest, and continue to support self-righteous writers who receive admiration and rewards from a society that foolishly and sadly makes idols of uneducated, unemployed morons who somehow fell into lots of money.
I'd suggest to avoid this movie.",1249171200,7,6141,4.790566037735849
3964747,4,B002PLPQME,"It's a well known fact that comedians get their comedy from pain. Richard Pryor was able to joke about his drug abuse, his numerous marriages, his heart attack, and running down the street engulfed in flames, and audiences laughed right along with him. I wonder why that is. Maybe it's because if they don't laugh, then they will cry, and crying is a lot less fun. I worry, however, that it comes at too high a cost. Are comedians using humor as a form of therapy, or are they trying sidestep the problem and not deal with their emotions? In ""Funny People,"" successful comedian/actor George Simmons (Adam Sandler) learns that he has a rare form of leukemia, and his one shot at beating it is a series of experimental drugs that come with no guarantees; all of a sudden, everything in his life becomes a struggle, and what's worse, he doesn't have the tools necessary to cope. He can't even joke about himself in front of an audience.

""Funny People"" is Judd Apatow's most engaging film yet--funny and surprisingly heartfelt, with believable characters and a carefully structured screenplay. It might not have worked were it not for Sandler, who doesn't play George as a terminally ill clich but as a person we actually have sympathy for. In spite of his fame and fortune, in spite of the many films he has starred in (mostly lowbrow entertainment), he's not in a relationship and he has no real friends to speak of. He all but forgot about his family after moving to Los Angeles. Now he's told he may not have very long to live, and all he can do is keep telling jokes. It doesn't seem to be helping, however; underneath it all, he's lonely and desperate. The more he re-evaluates his life, the more he realizes how unfulfilling it has been.

He soon meets an up-and-coming standup comedian named Ira Wright (Seth Rogen), who sleeps on a sofabed in the apartment of another comedian (Jonah Hill) and an actor (Jason Schwartzman). Quiet and good-natured yet equally desperate, his jokes are really no better or worse than those from your average raunchy teen sex comedy. Nevertheless, after hearing some of his material, George hires Ira as his comedy writer. He does tell Ira about his condition, but that doesn't mean he considers Ira a friend; even with the possibility of death hanging over him, George continues to be the same self-serving man he has always been. The only difference is that now, his needs are greater--as he lies in bed trying to fall asleep, for example, he forces Ira to sit in a chair directly next to the bed and tell funny stories. It seems George wants that human contact without the added hassle of emotional attachment, which is all well and good until the other person begins to feel manipulated.

The anger and bitterness notwithstanding, it can't be denied that George is bonding with Ira--becoming his mentor, if you will. It also can't be denied that Ira, despite being younger and less experienced, is helping George go through the process of finding peace in his life, of getting him to see what's really important. He knows early on that George must reach out to family and friends for emotional support, even if he's not ready for it. There's only so much Ira can do, and it's not as if he has gone through anything like this (""All my grandparents are still alive,"" he muses, trying his best not to cry). But who can George turn to? How can ask for support when he has shown love to so few people?

As it turns out, there has been only one person George has truly loved: His ex-girlfriend, Laura (Leslie Mann), who now lives in Marin County, California with a husband and two children. In spite of the events that led to their breakup, Laura still has feelings for George, and they only intensify when she learns that he's sick. But can she leave her husband, an Australian businessman named Clarke (Eric Bana)? He's not a perfect man; his temper certainly isn't always under control. In many ways, he's exactly like George, which is probably what attracted Laura to him in the first place. But the fact remains: She has a life with him. And yes, she does love him. What can George do at this point? How can Ira make him see that it would be in his best interest to let Laura go?

In spite of the fact that much of the creative team have known each other for years (Apatow and Sandler were once roommates, Apatow is married to Mann, Rogen has been cast in all of Apatow's films), the reality is that every actor in ""Funny People"" is perfectly cast, which is good because it makes the story that much more compelling. Sandler and Rogen give their best performances to date--the former continues to refine the raw emotions he utilized in ""Punch Drunk Love"" and ""Reign Over Me,"" while the latter reveals a subtler, more relatable side to his personality. They add considerable depth to a film that easily could have been just another formulaic buddy story. This is only Apatow's third film, so we probably have yet to see his greatest achievement. But this will do for now.",1248998400,3,5009,4.617283950617284
3964748,4,B002PLPQME,"George (Adam Sandler) is a successful comedian that finds out he has a blood disease and isn't given long to live. He becomes depressed and lonely and latches on to a struggling stand up comedian named Ira (Seth Rogen). He makes him his assistant and has him write jokes for him, as well as sit by his bed until he falls asleep lol. George starts to think of what his life could have been like if he didn't cheat on the love of his life (Leslie Mann) 12 years ago and tries to reconnect with her.

  The movie is touching and very funny but it didn't have to be so long. There's a lot that could have been cut out. The movie has an edge because of George dieing but it loses that edge long before the movie is almost over. Funny People is still an entertaining and fun movie about dieing, friendship and love. It is occasionally depressing but it's a lot more funny than it is depressing.

  Despite Sandler and Rogen showing more ability than we're used to from them, the movie has it's flaws. I mean there's no good reason for Ira to even go with George when he's visiting his ex. He's only there so they can share more scenes together. Plus there's like a million penis jokes that could have been cut out too. Judd Apatow is one of the best comedy directors, but he could be even better if he left out scenes that weren't needed. Despite that, I can't say he has made a movie I haven't liked. Plus he managed to make an Adam Sandler movie that I enjoyed. Sandler for once was actually excellent. While Rogen showed he can do more than just play a stoner.",1248998400,,1557,4.261016949152542

It also raises the question, ""what would modern comedians write jokes about if they couldn't use reproductive organs as source material?"" Oops, should I have given a spoiler alert? You can also tell they used a laugh track in this film, as most of the jokes were not funny. Sandler and Rogen have starred in genuinely good films.

3964754,2,B002PLPQME,"The good news is that it was two movies in one.  The bad news is that first one was pretty bad, and the better one (the second one) was not given enough time.  For about the first hour of this movie, I kept wondering whether Leslie Mann is actually in it.  Then she comes in and essentially a whole new film begins.  For example, the first hour of Funny People takes places over several days or weeks but then the second half (the Leslie Mann part) takes place over an evening and then just a few days.  In addition to the striking contrast between the two parts of Funny People is the marked lack of compatibility between them.  The first part is just about very crude sexual humor and the second part is more of a potentially rekindled romance.  Anyone who likes the first half of this movie will be completely disinterested in the second half and vice-versa.  So someone in editing/story writing needed to make the either the first part or the second part of this 2 and a half hour movie much shorter.  Pick one type of movie to be, stick with it, and let the chips fall where they may.  Otherwise, you're left with two bad parts.  I gave this film two stars only because the second half of it was good, but it was just so underdeveloped that it really is a shame to have wasted that good storyline on a film like this.",1491350400,,1322,4.290322580645161

I knew that Apatow and Sandler were friends before they were famous and had always wondered when they would do something like this together. I always thought that when they did it would be a straight up comedy like both are more commonly known for. Instead we got this great film that as funny moments but has more heart than anything else. I had also known that Sandler could pull off roles like this since he has done some serious films but this may be his best performance.

Sandler plays a comedian who is very very successful but is dying due to a rare blood disease. After learning the news he starts to realize that the life he has lead has left him a lonely man. So in his depression he goes to a comedy club longing for his younger days or something and notes a comedian that he likes, Seth Rogan. He hires him to write for him and to also be his assistant. He also longs for his ex but he lost her during his time indulging in his fame. So as time goes by and he draws closer to death he finds he needs people more than he thought.

I knew this would be good based on who wrote and directed it but I wasn't expecting some of the acting to be as good as it was. Like I said Sandler was going to be good but he did possibly his best job here playing the struggling comedian. What surprised me was Rogan and crew as they all did very well with the dramatic stuff. Of course by now we all know Jonah Hill is the best actor to come out of the Apatow troop and this may have been the first time I noticed it.

Also this is probably Rogans best turn as well since he always plays the same character basically. He is still kinda the same character here but the flashes of the dramatic acting is what made me a fan. Like Hill he would go on to more dramatic films [while still having the comedic element] like 50/50 and such. Also I have always loved Leslie Mann and as usual she is great here.

This is a really good film and one of the best from all involved, maybe not the best but one of. On the 2 disc DVD you get all kinds of special features from behind the scenes making of stuff to old videos of Sandler and them but it is the commentary from Apatow, Sandler and Rogan that I enjoyed the most. I do recommend this flick to anyone who is a fan of anybody that was involved in the film.",1421884800,,2308,4.07488986784141

Seth Rogen is believably funny, and when coupled with Adam Sandler, it makes for a wildly entertaining tug at the heart.  A friendship developed under extenuating circumstances.  Apatow had trouble letting these characters go, and it shows.  The film is filled with comedic moments, like a cameo with James Taylor, but he keeps them going too long.  A great film that went about 30 minutes longer than it needed to.  Still a must see comedy.

I am curious about the level of collaboration between Judd Apatow, the writer and director and Sandler, because the character seems so obviously based on Sandler, but with a dark side none of us have seen.

I think Sandler was outstanding in this role, and wonder how he felt about taking the risk playing a character that is based on him, but is SO unlikeable.

I wonder if this is an unconscious reason so many viewers gave this movie such bad reviews.  They just weren't ready to see him, especially in an Apatow movie, that was so dark.",1411257600,,745,4.455882352941177

Regarding the humor, it's a typical Apatow movie, so if you don't like that brand of humor, don't watch.  I found the story to be very creative, and I loved how they weaved in actual stand up in the storyline of the movie.  I saw some reviewers who said they didn't laugh once during this movie.  If you didn't laugh once during this movie, then you either have zero sense of humor, or your sense of humor is SO obscure and demanding that you shouldn't write reviews in which you advise other people.  Yes, it's crude; yes, there's a lot of cussing.  Apatow has made enough movies now where one would think the viewer would know what they are in for.  It's also rated R.

I also think people looked at the cast list and the title and expected a laugh-a-minute- type of comedy.  The movie is somewhat dark and definitely has its slower moments, but I feel that the style is intended to be laid back and casual, a much more slower pace than other comedies.  If you're looking at the ""from the director of Knocked Up"" thinking it's that type of comedy, you're in for a shock.  But if you can consider this more of a comedy/drama, you can really start to enjoy it.

As a standup comedian myself, I also feel that the movie is a good reflection of the life of a comic; 2 minutes of hilarity followed by 30 minutes of a normal life.  You'll also notice that the comedians pepper random jokes in their daily conversation.  The cameo apperances end up being a nice treat in addition to the main cast.  Thankfully, the story and script are such that they don't rely on the actors to carry the film.

The extended version does include more of the slower moments, but also includes the funnier ones as well.  Basically, if you liked the theatrical version, you'll enjoy the unrated one as well.

You'll notice that the price on this is lower because it never got the following from other movies of 2009.  I say, take advantage of that.",1393977600,,1481,4.4646840148698885

While some points in the movie had diologue that sounded forced, they were few and far between and the rest of the film completely made up for that.  Ultimately, my biggest complaint that there wasn't more stand-up comedy.  Having a number of DVDs of stand-up specials, I enjoy those very much and would have liked to see more in this film...in fact, they ought to make full-length comedy specials for all the characters...they've got the film somewhere, I think.

3964845,5,B002PLPQME,"""Funny People"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: George Simmons is a famous stand-up comedian, who learns that he has a terminal illness and less than a year to live. When, he meets Ira, a struggling comedian at a comedy club where both the comedians are performing, George hires Ira to be his personal assistant and opening act at his performances. The two forge a close friendship as George helps Ira with his career and Ira helps George find closure in his legacy. However, when George learns that his disease has gone into remission and an ex-girlfriend re-enters his life, he's inspired to reevaluate what is important to him and what truly gives meaning to his life.

The cast led by Adam Sandler (in a career-best performance as George), Seth Rogen (also executive produced) (impressive as Ira), & Leslie Mann (great as Laura) are excellent! The directing and story and screenplay by Judd Apatow (Mann's husband) (who also produced) (he has also produced, wrote, and directed ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005) & ""Knocked Up"" (2007), both which also starred Rogen) is excellent!

The music by Michael Andrews (who also did the music to ""Donnie Darko"" (2001, which featured Rogen) & ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" (2007, which was also produced and written by Apatow) & Jason Schwartzman (who plays Mark in the movie) is excellent! The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (who has done the cinematography to Steven Spielberg's movies since ""Schindler's List"" (1993) is excellent! The film editing by Craig Alpert & Brent White (both of them did the cinematography to ""Knocked Up"", separately & recently, Alpert did the cinematography to ""Pineapple Express"" (2007, which Apatow produced and co-wrote the story with Rogen, who also executive produced), White did the cinematography to ""Step Brothers"" (2008, which Apatow produced) is excellent! The casting by Allison Jones (who did the casting to ""Knocked Up"" & ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", she also did the casting to ""Step Brothers"" & ""Superbad"" (2007, which Apatow produced and Rogen executive produced and wrote the story & screenplay) is excellent! The production design by Jefferson Sage (who also did the production design to ""Knocked Up"", ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" & ""Year One"" (2009, which Apatow produced) is excellent! The art direction by James F. Truesdale (who also did the art direction to ""Drag Me To Hell"" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Leslie A. Pope (who is doing the set decoration to the upcoming ""Get Him To The Greek"" (2010, which Apatow will either, executive produce or produce) is excellent! The costume design by Betsy Heimann (who also did the costume design to ""The Ugly Truth"" (2009) & Nancy Steiner (who also did the costume design to the upcoming ""Paul"" (2010), ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009) & ""Youth In Revolt"" (2009) is excellent!

This is an excellent comedy-drama that hits all the right notes. Sandler amazes with his best performance of his career, so far. This movie is a little long, but it gets the story settled. This is Apatow's best movie so far. This is one of the best movies of the year, thus far.",1369526400,,3116,4.9655172413793105

Now what I will say is the runtime is a bit extensive and the ending gets monotonous, I would have shaved 20 - 40 minutes off, but what I think people don't like the most about the film is how real the picture is.

A lot of people went into the movie thinking ""I'm gonna get to watch a hilarious comedy with some of the funniest people in the business"" when the film is just too real for that. Truly brilliant comedy does shine through, even from a somewhat cameo by Eric Bana (who spent the first 10 years of his career as a comedian), throwing in Bana was kind of a cool nod to the reference of him in Knocked Up ""If any of us get laid tonight it's because of Eric Bana"".

But one of the things I enjoyed most was the whole life of a stand-up comedian from the big time to the small time, not to mention all the actors used were real comedians. Also Sandler's character (really just playing himself almost parodying his recent terrible movies) has a ridiculously awesome house.",1356393600,2,1207,4.36

'Funny People' is a (very) full-bodied (and smart) DRAMA first and foremost but without ever voiding the plot of Apatow, and Sandler's, comedic sensibilities which are still seen and felt throughout. It's still a FUNNY movie underneath it all. I call it Apatow's BEST film and it's quite a shame it actually LOST money at the box office! Perhaps it's the way the film was advertised or the expectations movie-goers had going into it; or maybe even the LENGTH of the film. To those who say it 'went on too long' SO don't appreciate the artistic statement at-hand! The whole 'extended' sequence involving Sandler and Rogen's characters visiting the former's ex (Leslie Mann)/ staying in Marin County is what MAKES this film! A more-than-2-hour film is ONLY a 'bad idea' if it's a BAD or mediocre film. If you've only seen it once and weren't satisfied, do yourself a favor and see it at least a couple more times. Like 'Freaks and Geeks' ten years prior which gained much belated acclaim in all the years since it unjustly/criminally went off the air after only 18 episodes, this one shall become more and more appreciated in the years/decades to come as well.",1352592000,,1443,4.73015873015873

George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.

I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame.

I consume the content of stand-ups like C.K., Cross, Tompkins, Glass, Jeselnik, Ansari, Posehn, Miller, and Holmes-to name a few. If you lean that way in your comedy preferences then my review will likely be applicable to you.

I love this movie. You must go into it not knowing what to expect i.e. don't assume you know the movie will have the same feeling as knocked up. The characters are hilarious in their struggles and their actors are superb. Great director, great cast, and a hell of an perspective on alternative comedy.

However, if you go into this film thinking it will be like 40-yr old Virgin or Hangover, then you will be disappointed (which is where all the low rated reviews come from).

This film does a great job of showing us the life of a Comedian/Actor who is dying from an illness.

The film has a whole lot of levels going on which is over the head of most of the people who rated the film low.

It is a comedic form of the movie Inception.  You have actors playing comedians who have dual lives where they alternate from being ""on"" and ""off""....

The problem is most people have a misconception of how comedians live their real lives.

Anyways, great movie.  Go in with the mindset that you are watching a drama and this movie will blow you away.

The problem with this movie is that it has too much going to have a consistent plot to it. The talents of Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen are totally wasted here. Jason Schwartzman, who I thought was entertaining in Fantastic Mr. Fox, also has his talent wasted here. The part with him being a TV actor on a show called ""Yo Teach!"" was laughably bad.

3964880,3,B002PLPQME,"***Spoiler Review*** (If possible)

Adam Sandler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sandler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.

I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying ""tweet"" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you.",1287014400,,997,4.564245810055866
3964881,5,B002PLPQME,"One of the best surprises of 2009 is this beautifully written character study of comedians with subtle but realistic humour and original narrative. The Blu-ray transfer is gorgeous, which is very important because the producers have taken great lenghts to photograph the film in a very cinematic way. This is not a typical script with predictable motivations and predictable story development, it has an original voice and at 2 and a half hours, it takes itself quite seriously.

I don't give away plot points in my reviews, I just share key factors of the films' strengths, as per example the way it's filmed and the way the story is told. Funny People succeeds on all counts and at the same time is one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see! This is a journey worth taking in the world of movie-making and definitely Adam Sandler's best performance and the most interesting character he's ever played since the film SPANGLISH. Also a very juicy part for Eric Bana in a supporting role that he conveys with great energy and will be remembered for years.",1284163200,,1063,4.7771739130434785
3964882,4,B002PLPQME,"This is a great movie, flaws and all. While I give it a very solid 4 stars, it was rife with 5-star moments many of which come in the form of very funny moments especially if you like stand-up, vulgarity and all.  Adam Sandler is a funny guy on and off stage and there is quite a bit of on-stage time here.  This movie was so much better than some of the tripe he's done (Billy Madison, Anger Management, etc) and is in the league of some of his better work, closest in tone to say ""Punch Drunk Love"" - a great movie.  This movie is not quite the seemless piece of art/drama/comedy that that one was, and it suffers from flaws.  ""Meandering"" as some have put it does accurately describe the second half somewhat, though I still found it interesting and entertaining.

The other reason it's good is the subject matter it deals with.  Yeah, it's been done before - man finds out his life's due date is approaching - but it was fun to see Sandler do it.  I mention this 'cause I just saw a Michael Douglas movie which had a similar theme (The Solitary Man - also not bad).  I think this is a fascinating topic (and a brave one) for Hollywood to dig into.  I find movies that consider these themes educational and therepeutical in the highest sense.  And I give credit to this movie for being so simultaneously funny and thought-provoking.  There are some other gems as well, speaking of therepeutic - a thought coming from the Australian husband who said ""Underneath anger is hurt, but underneath hurt is love"" - bang! Hit that nail on the head.  I suppose people know that already, but for him to realize it right at that moment was an enlightening epiphany (both for him and for me).

To sum up, it's not a movie without flaws but if you like a sly sense of humour and don't mind movies that go beyond slapstick, give this one a try.  Sandler is in good form and the guy that plays his hired friend (and his friends as well) did a pretty decent job in a movie that I found at least entertaining.

It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior.  I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior.

It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.

There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.",1280016000,,708,4.086330935251799

No knock to 40yr OV, I liked that movie to, but, I think we must have different definitions of ""worth while"".  This movie is intensely funny, dramatic, sad, silly, complex, vulgar, and the list could go on... It's real life and I loved it.

3964886,3,B002PLPQME,"The movie Funny People has baffled many of Sandler and Apatow's fans because it's very different from each man's respective work. But that doesn't mean that the film is weaker by any means. Yes, the film is flawed, it's too long, and draggy in parts. The last 45 to 60 minutes seem disjointed, compared to the first half of the film that focuses on Sandler's relationship with Ira, Seth Rogen's character.

But it's also a very clever blend of comedy and drama, which is very difficult to put together in most contemporary films. I really believe this is Sandler's best role, a mature man filled with loneliness and regret. It's an honest examination of how far a man will go to correct all of the mistakes he's made in his life.

Sandler is the star of the show, and anyone expecting the caricature that Dennis Dugan has created of Sandler should walk away. Sandler isn't doing Billy Madison, or Little Nicky here. This is Sandler playing a comedian with more depth.

The relationship between Sandler and Rogen is explored really well. Of course, I would rather see Apatow focus the whole movie on their relationship, rather than his relationship with Leslie Mann, but at least you can't fault Apatow for his ambitious vision.

The film bites off more than it can chew, but I really do believe it's one of the best comedies of the decade, and the highlight of Sandler's career.",1277856000,5,1378,4.681818181818182
3964887,2,B002PLPQME,"Around 110 minutes into this Judd Apatow marathon I started checking my watch.  And then I found myself rooting for an ending. . .any ending.  Just end movie, end.  Yet FUNNY PEOPLE mercilessly droned on for another half hour, culminating in predictable endings for the story's alleged love triangle and friendship between the two central male characters (Adam Sandler and Seth Rogan).  Which begs the question:  If everyone watching knows what's going to happen, why not wrap this puppy up and be done with it?

Granted, Apatow is attempting a darker story than his zany earlier offerings.  Sandler plays a comedic superstar who learns he's ailing from a deadly blood disease; accordingly Sandler deadpans this role, which only makes him completely and irretrievably unlikable.  Rogan as the nobody friend of Sandler actually has some funny moments as he develops his standup routine over the course of the film, yet unfortunately there are too few of them to salvage a movie that meanders and sloshes its way to a yawnfest ending.  Eric Bana is actually refreshing playing the hubby of Sandler's former love interest (Leslie Mann, anyone?), yet he arrives too late for his energy to create any positive effect.  The ensemble cast (including Jonah Hill, Aubrey Plaza, and Jason Schwartzman) even looks tired and bored as FUNNY PEOPLE enters its second hour--quite the contrast from Apatow's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>, a comedy Apatow has yet to successfully replicate.

3964888,3,B002PLPQME,"Funny People HAS to be the strangest movie Adam Sandler ever starred in.  It's also one of the most vulgar films in the ever growing long list of Sandler movies.

I swear the entire first half of Funny People had absolutely no storyline whatsoever.  Even the way the film begins is honestly just a bunch of pointless nonsense.  It consists of nothing but highly offensive stand-up comedy routines at night clubs involving the main characters, but the amount of crude humor becomes so tasteless that the entire first half of Funny People ends up being nothing but a big distraction.

At least the film improves by actually GOING somewhere during the second half- we find out that Adam Sandler had a girlfriend a long time ago, and he wants to be with her again.  Unfortunately for him, the woman has a family now, but he tries to win her over anyway (even though her Australian husband doesn't care for any of Sandler's nonsense one bit).

Funny People is also quite offensive in that Adam Sandler's character is supposed to be a portrayal of someone who is sick with a deadly disease (leukemia) and yet, if that were the case, then why in the world are all those disgusting sexual references *still* taking place?  Wouldn't a person dying of a disease, you know, STOP acting like an immature disgusting weirdo every second of the day?  I realize this is supposed to be a completely fictional comedy, but still, it's not realistic in the slightest.

So to put things into perspective, Adam Sandler doesn't do a particularly good job portraying a sick person because in reality nobody would act that way if they were really dying of a horrible disease.  People with leukemia wouldn't find this movie funny at all, and rightfully so.  Weird.

So basically the first half of the film is nothing but a terrible display of really crude humor as part of frequently stand-up comedy performances from the main characters, and the second half -while still pretty disgusting and inappropriate for anyone under the age of 18- at least delivers with a typical SOMEWHAT satisfying Adam Sandler performance (he's not exactly my favorite actor of all-time, either).

I can't recommend this film to anyone, really.  It's not a quality movie, the humor is highly inappropriate and disgusting for the majority of it, and the storytelling suffers from taking WAY too long to actually get going.  I'm disappointed in Adam Sandler even going along with something like this.",1277510400,,2451,4.827751196172249

3964890,3,B002PLPQME,"Judd Apatow's  third film after The 40 year old virgin and Knocked up ventures in to serious cinema territory. Supposedly Adam Sandler was his former roommate and the film's opening scenes show them making crank calls to people.
Adam Sandler plays George Simmons who is a top stand up comedian and revered by young aspiring comics because of that he is disconnected from reality and does not have a real friend. He lives surrounded by yes-men and a lot of women. Suddenly he is diagnosed with a fatal disease which is similar to leukemia. George Simmons meets a struggling comic Ira Wright aka Ira Weiner (Seth Rogen) at a local club and hires him to do his writing and become his almost live-in attendant for 1500 dollars a week. Ira is not so funny and has been struggling a lot so he quickly takes up the offer much to the chagrin of his roommates (Jason Schwartzman & Jonah Hill) who had been moderately successful till Ira landed this job.
Ira gets to travel with George and gets to experience firsthand the privileges that come with success and also face the tantrums and mood swings that successful people are expected to have. Ira does a good job despite being humiliated constantly by George Simmons. Unexpectedly an old flame - the one that got away enters George's life again, Leslie Mann, she still loves him but she is married.
Seth Rogen as the assistant Ira delivers a great performance as the submissive, yet helpful attendant to George Simmons. I thought the performance was great because he could have been pathetic in many scenes but is not. I have not seen many Adam Sandler movies but this was great acting as he played it with such great care. In my opinion, the role of a dying man who is famous and does not have any friends could have been a flop, but Sandler does a great job. Leslie Mann as Simmons former girlfriend is good as someone who is caught between old love and the security of a family with children. Eric Bana is the surprise of the movie- Loved him as the obnoxious husband to Leslie's character. The movie tries to offer a realistic portrayal of a standup comics carrer and has been strewn with appearances by many celebrities such as James Taylor, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, Ray Romano, Eminem (Hilarious) The music is great and has great tunes by Lennon & Warren Zevon. I am thinking of buying the soundtrack. This is not the best movie you can watch but it is still watchable considering it is almost 2 hours and 26 minutes long.

3964891,5,B002PLPQME,"'Funny People' is a masterpiece. A tender, profound, truly moving and deeply human story that has a great abundance of depths, it is also often indeed very funny. A story about a rich, successful, comic actor who has lost himself (or never found himself) it deserves to be a major global hit, and I suspect the only reason it isn't is that it is if anything too perceptive and subtle for the market at which it seems to have been intended. The script is witty, endlessly inventive, the direction and the story itself give you a sense of watching a slice of life more than a heavily plotted tale (though don't worry, there is plenty of story going on). The acting is wonderful: Adam Sandler is a joy to watch, very moving, compelling and funny too. Seth Rogen has a great chemistry with him and is perfectly convincing as an ambitious yet a genuinely caring employee and friend. Leslie Mann is the emotional core of the film just as she was in '17 Again' and her character in 'Funny People' is a deep and convincing portrayal of a woman who to some extent is as lost as the Sandler character. The supporting performances are wonderful: the two daughters of the Leslie Mann character (in fact Leslie Mann's kids in real life) are extremely accomplished young actresses, and the other support performances are all tremendously good.

Well done to everyone concerned for making a truly remarkable movie that will repay repeated viewings.

3964892,4,B002PLPQME,"Funny People stars Adam Sandler as an old pro comedian, along the lines of, say, Robin Williams, who learns that he has a fatal disease. Because of this diagnosis he decides to go back to his stand-up comedy roots and does a bitter and depressing impromptu set at The Comedy Club, which is where he got his start. While there he sees Seth Rogan, a newbie comic starting at the bottom of the ranks and working in a deli during the day. Sandler likes Rogen's set and asks the Rogen character to write jokes for him and be his assistant.

The movie is fairly raunchy, both in the stuff that happens in the lives of the characters, and in the material they use on stage, so if you're easily offended, stay away. As a once-upon-a-time aspiring comedian, however, I found the look into the lives of beginning and old-time comedians educational. It felt to me that this is the way it probably is for a lot of comedians. There are Rogen's comedian roommates, Johah Hill and Jason Schwartzman, the latter having a lead role in a B-level sitcom (Yo, Teach!), the fame of which he uses to screw everything that moves (though he has a 10-day rule to give Rogen a chance, which makes me laugh, just thinking about it). Sandler has the same propensity for using his fame to his sexual advantage, which is probably why at this stage of his life he has no family and no friends, friend being another thing that could be added to Rogen's job description.

There are tons of cameos including one by the glasses-wearing, Eminem, who bullies an innocent, just-standing-in-line Ray Romano.

So, get it if you're a fan of stand-up or any of the actors (Leslie Mann is Sandler's old flame and Eric Bana is her new husband). Stay away if you're offended by lots of swearing, raunchy jokes and behavior, and an over-all lack of morals by most of the characters.",1274659200,,1836,4.540785498489426

People saw the cast - Adam Sandler, Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, etc - and thought this was going to be a ""laugh-out-loud"" slap-stick comedy that would be reminiscent of Apatow's previous hit movies.

Funny People is hilarious, but it doesn't ultimately give you the same experience as ""40-year old Virgin"".  The humor is dry, mostly sarcastic and as well it should be.  Remember, folks, the comedian is DYING.  Supporting actors who are also real life comedians perform stand up in the movie and it's funny.  Some people may be disappointed with the stand up routines, but again, remember that the comedians are SUPPOSED to be struggling amateurs, trying to make it big.

The story of a comedian facing his demise is something of a cruel joke and Adam Sandler plays the character well.  He alternates between being a great, friendly, likeable guy and a disenchanted, grumpy jerk. I think this is one of Adam Sandler's best and most complex roles since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punch-Drunk-Love-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Superbit-Collection/dp/B00000G02H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punch-Drunk Love (Two Disc Special Edition) (Superbit Collection)</a>. Seth Rogen and Leslie Mann also deliver great supporting roles to help flesh out the movie.  The bit part played by Jonah Hill is also endearing.

While Funny People makes an interesting drama it starts to drag its heels towards the end and the movie could've probably been twenty minutes shorter and just as good.  The amount of the time and the depth dedicated to the romantic subplot between Leslie Mann's character and Eric Bana's character is a bit unnecessary.  I get that they're married and that it poses a problem, but I don't need the details and those details didn't add much, if anything, to the movie. (And frankly, it couldn't have been that important to the movie since I don't even remember those characters' names.) The movie is best at the beginning and when it sticks to the main storyline of George's eventual demise.

I'd recommend this film to Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow fans as well as viewers who enjoy dramas.  If you're looking for laugh-out-loud moments and non-stop jokes, this isn't the movie for you. But if you're a fan of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;and other uncomfortably-awkward movies, this might just be the movie you need to watch.

Funny People is certainly too long (though so was Knocked Up, if push comes to shove) and often feels incomplete--as if the director hadn't quite decided which scenes to cut and which to leave in--but it's worth nothing that the film develops real characters and puts them through a storyline that doesn't rigidly follow the romantic comedy template as Apatow's previous works did; it may be a film in which Apatow's reach exceeds his grasp, but it's also the first time he's reached high in the first place.

This movie should have been entitled Revolting People Who Are Not in the Least Bit Funny.  The movie is pathologically unfunny.  It is so unfunny, it is very hard to tell where the humor is supposed to lie.  Instead, the movie is a bleak yarn about stand-up comedians whose material is... supposed to be funny, apparently, judging by title and by the tittering of the comedy audiences in the movie, who constitute a kind of living laugh track.  But I cannot begin to fathom what is supposed to be funny about this material.  ""If the guy from MySpace (big MySpace logo in background, clearly a product placement) and the guy from Craigslist got in a fight, I wonder who'd win.""  This is one of the ""jokes"" in the movie that is supposed to be funny.  Then James Taylor features in the movie as a kind of commercial for himself, to no purpose whatsoever.  The only way I could make sense of this movie is as an anti-comedy: a movie that is supposed to be funny only because it is so completely unfunny.  However, this subtle type of humor is rarely intentionally perpetrated.  But if you want some genuine anti-comedy stand up material, here it is:

(COMEDIAN GETS UP ON STAGE, COMES TENTATIVELY TO MICROPHONE) ""Uhh... hi.  The um, the scheduled comedian is stuck in traffic and he sent me over here to fill in for him till he gets here."" (LOOKS NERVOUS, CONSULTS PIECE OF PAPER, SAYS TREMULOUSLY) ""So uhhh... he emailed me some of his material and I'll ask you to bear with me while I get through it the best I can... (SQUINTS) But it's kind of hard to read.  My printer is low on toner.  I don't know if you've noticed, but Brother printers seem to eat toner.  For a couple years I had an Epson, which somehow lasted a lot longer on a single toner cartridge... though I might have been using it on the low-toner setting... I'm not quite sure.  You know how you can set the printer, through the computer, to be in toner-saver mode?  I think I might have done that with that other one... I don't know why I've never bothered to do that with the printer I have now but umm... Anyway, let's get started on some of this material and hopefully we can work through about half of it before Joe gets here.  But (CONSULTS WATCH) since I've been talking I see about five minutes have elapsed and so I'd better go through the material at about one and a half times normal speed in order to catch up... but then, that might not be very funny... on the other hand it might make it funnier... show of hands, who out there thinks that speeding things up makes them funnier?  C'mon now... okay, one... two... three... only three people?  Okay, well, I guess I could ask now who DOESN'T think speeding things up makes them funnier... but then I already know the answer, don't I?  I mean I could just subtract three from  the total number of people in the room... but then I suppose some people might not have an opinion one way or the other and so that approach might not work.

3964902,5,B002PLPQME,"This film is remarkable for just how much it blurs the lines of reality in the service of fiction.  Apatow and Sandler have have been friends for a long time and lived with each other for awhile on the comedy scene.  The movie opens with vintage footage on his offtime from the Ben Stiller show.  That being said there are certain things known to be different from Sandler and his character, but you do wonder how he feels about the negative aspects of fame and fortune.  I would say most of those things are true for him, but he enjoys it more.  The other younger characters are there to show you the way it is from the ground up and Apatow has interesting things to say about it.  Jason Schwartzman's character says so much about ambiguous nature of fame that's out of your control.  He's made a rich man by doing clearly bad work, created by bad writers, but in the service of supposedly being hip and socially conscious.  What's he to make of it, though, when he's rewarded for being terrible and consenting to it.  It's hard for people who even recognize this, to not become conceited and that's exactly what happens.  The film makes an interesting rumination on things people hardly consider when trying to make it in show biz, you take what they give you, not necessarily what you want.  Technically, it makes that statement about life as well and for those who don't find it funny even though it does achieve that, if you go back it does make that statement repeatedly.

3964903,5,B002PLPQME,"Any churlish citizens waiting for Judd Apatow to make a bad movie in the wake of his successful and solid first two--40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up--will be disappointed by Funny People. It is very, very good, emotionally satisfying, funny on a number of nicely nuanced levels, and best of all, a film aimed directly at grownups. Of course, anybody who's watched a film from the Apatow cabal with anything like a discriminating eye will have noted a consistent theme--underneath the extremely crude sexual and scatological humor, male bonding and fantasies of perpetual adolescence lies a call for responsibility, wisdom and discretion. Very cannily, Apatow recognizes his audience and doesn't disappoint; he draws in the beer and bong crowd with the promise, always delivered on, of rude hijinks and memorably pornographic dialog, then delivers the medicine. Boiled down, his message is this: Grownup can be sexy, fun and tonic too. His male point of view characters begin as feckless kids and, somewhere along the line, don the mantle of responsibility and adulthood along with the love of a good woman. Ultimately, Apatow's vision is a conservative one, made easier to digest with gallons of silly fun.

In this one, Adam Sandler's character George Simmons, a highly successful comedian, has a near-death (or maybe that should be near-life) experience. Living the high life without ever really touching other lives in a meaningful way, he's adapted himself to the cocoon of fame, with all the attendant glories (groupies, tons of tuff) allowing him to stay insulated from real emotion. Then he finds out he has a rare blood disease, a form of leukemia, comes to terms with ""the one that got away"" (the always-lovely Apatow regular Leslie Mann) and his family. With the help of Seth Rogen's Ira Wright, a struggling, up-and-coming comedian, he discovers himself, deepens, and gains perspective. I won't rehearse the rest of the plot; all I will say is, this movie will last a long time. Long after the beers and bong hits have been downed, Funny People will continue to resonate in adult hearts. It's a bittersweet valentine to the profession of comedy and a heartfelt, smart tribute to the virtues of growing up. Apatow's stable of actors display dimensions you've rarely seen them portray.

My main gripe was that the film's main character, George Simmons(Adam Sandler), was an overbearing narcissistic heel.  But it dawned on me that this was purely intentional and that Apatow and Sandler are taking a leap in expecting their audience to accept this reality.  This is a hard film to like but ambitious viewers should admire what Apatow is attempting here.  In this epic of sorts Apatow gives some choice parts to the immensely talented Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill and they run with it.  It's kind of like Sandler is passing the torch or at the very least sharing the spotlight with these newcomers.

Adam Sandler does a great job of portraying a cynical, cold, veteran king of comedy who has had it all and done it all (not too much of a stretch). The supporting cast is pretty good, and the comedy within the movie seems real enough, but I really enjoyed Sandler's performance for most of the movie. The only problem I have really is the fact that for me the buildup and climax of the movie was the weakest part of the film - a little boring and overdone, though it ended strong afterward. I found Seth Rogen to be good in some scenes but also boring in others - he seems better suited to play a more raunchy and cynical character himself rather than the relatively innocent guy he tries to portray here.

This is half drama and half comedy, not a ""mainstream"" type of movie, but Sandler's performance anchored the film and I recommend it.

WRITTEN BY: Judd Apatow

DIRECTED BY: Judd Apatow

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy / Drama
Release Date: 31 July 2009

I wasn't very enthusiastic when I saw the trailer for Funny People; writer and director Judd Apatow's third film. I loved Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin is easily in my top five favorite comedies of all time. Also, I'm huge fans of Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen, so naturally this caught me by surprise.

Whoever put together the trailer desperately tried to make it look like as much of a comedy as Apatow's first two films. I wasn't too excited to see the film because I didn't think it looked very funny. It's no wonder the comedic elements seemed scarce - it's more of a drama.

One reason I am such a huge fan of Apatow's work, is that his films feel less like movies and more like real life. Nearly every single element of them could actually happen. This all stems from his passion for writing of his own personal experiences. Furthermore, all of his films are consistently relatable to one's own life in one way or another.

In addition to his great writing, Apatow is a master at pulling real heartfelt feelings out of his entire cast and displaying them on film. Even when the characters are being funny or crude and vulgar, you can't help but believe this is exactly how they would act if the character were a real person.

The movie shows us the dark side of a famous comedian and the rough underbelly of the world of stand-up. It also addresses how fame and fortune won't ""keep you warm at night."" It's called Funny People and it's about comedians, yes; but I also sense a double meaning in the title as it goes to great lengths to expose how ridiculous people are in general.

The story is centered on Adam Sandler's character, George Simmons. George is a huge comedic icon who has made several successful films with other well known celebrities. He lives in a huge mansion in L.A. and has more money than he knows what to do with. Sounds like he has the perfect life, right? Wrong.

George finds out within the first five minutes of the film, that he has an illness and doesn't have very long to live. If that's not bad enough, we soon learn he virtually has no-one close to share this information with; no family, no friends, no-one.

This is one of Sandler's best performances. There is a scene in about the middle of the film where he breaks down, loses his temper and makes a comment about how he pays for all of these things and none of them work; a play on words about his fame and success and how lonely it is. You really buy that he's a sad man who's made a lot of mistakes and owns them.

We are constantly reminded of George's massive fame by all of the movie paraphernalia in the background, and his uncomfortable run-ins with fans. The film is also deliciously scattered with moments of real footage of Sandler's younger years in comedy and we get a few samples of his lyrical talent through humorous songs as well. George constantly makes jokes about how famous he is and how it's his job to entertain the world. However, it is evident that he is not happy with this.

Upon hearing the unfortunate news, George decides to get back into stand-up. At a small comedy club, he meets Ira Wright, played magnificently by Seth Rogen.

It's not very often that you see a comedian try to be less funny and that's Rogen's task here. He plays a young comedian who thinks he is funnier than he really is and Rogen nails it. He's normally the obnoxious and arrogant stoner who never really grew up and he plays that beautifully too; but here he is a sensitive guy with insecurities and a bitter awkwardness.

George sees a bit of himself in Ira and hires him to write jokes for him. Ira's two roommates are funnier and more successful than him, so he jumps at this opportunity. His roommates are played by Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman.

It's easy to tell that Apatow specifically writes parts for the actors he has in mind and it makes you appreciate the character that much more. The scenes with Ira and his roommates are classic and realistic of how young bachelors can be towards each other.

Ira has been looking to further his life and is more than happy to spend less time at home with these two. Soon he and George hit it off and George hires him to be his personal assistant to do all sorts of things in addition to writing. Ira is the only person George can seem to communicate with and soon he lets him in on his secret.

At well over two hours, you get a lot more out of a Judd Apatow movie, than you do most comedies. There is plenty of time to get to know all of the characters; especially in the director's cut, available on video. In addition to this, there are several different subplots happening simultaneously.

We learn that George did at one time have a love in his life, but she is ""the one that got away."" Leslie Mann plays George's ex-girlfriend Laura and he finds a way to get back in touch with her after several years. She is now unhappily married to another man who fathered their two kids.

Mann and Sandler have great chemistry together, which is understandable as they have known each other for years and worked together in Big Daddy. Their characters hated each other in that film but here they share truly deep feelings that go way-back, and remind us of choices we made in our own pasts.

Ira becomes George's wingman as he goes to visit Laura in hopes of winning her back.

If you didn't know, Leslie Mann is the wife and mother of Judd Apatow's two kids, who play her kids in this film and in Knocked Up as well. Talent clearly runs through the Apatow family. I wouldn't be surprised if both of their daughters grow up to be stunning actresses just like their mother.

Again, because of the real-life chemistry that all of these people have together, it only makes the scenes that much more genuine and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure Seth Rogen has gotten to know the Apatow family over the span of his career as well and Sandler and Apatow have been friends since before either of them became famous. There are some really nice moments in this section of the film and as if things weren't going well enough, they only get more interesting when the husband unexpectedly shows up.

Eric Bana delivers one of the best comedic performances I have seen this year as Laura's obnoxious Australian husband, Clarke. You like him but you hate him at the same time. I learned that Bana is a big fan of comedy and did a lot of it in Australia and he has been waiting for the right opportunity to do more. What greater comeback could he have than an Apatow film?

Eventually Clarke catches on that George is after his wife and the two get into a hilarious fist fight in the front yard. Sandler delivers one of the film's funniest lines in reference to him not being qualified to fight back because he's a comedian.

It's so enjoyable to watch these movies. You laugh until you are blue in the face and you really care about the characters by the end of the film because you are so invested in them.

Apatow is an amazing filmmaker. He perfectly maps out each character and every single scene is filled with wit and humor.

Whether the movie is about losing your virginity (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) or having a child with the woman you love (Knocked Up) or trying to accept the fact that you let the love of your life slip through your fingers and you may die alone (Funny People); if it's an Apatow film, you know you will laugh and go on an emotional journey with the characters because we can all relate to them as people.

He isn't a very likable from the beginning of the movie or the end, or anywhere between that two-and-a-half hour window.  Or is the protagonist Seth Rogen?  He comes off as a sweet and sensitive character

If this wasn't a comedy movie, then what's the take home message?  How someone would think and act differently facing their upcoming mortality?  That concept has been beaten to death by books, Reader's Digest articles, bumper stickers (today is the first day of the rest of your life), and yes, other movies!!!  If you are interested in more of this concept, I recommend The Bucket List, Running Out of Time, or Rudy for god's sakes!

3964928,4,B002PLPQME,"Judd Apatow has made a name for himself in producing and directing amazingly hilarious, raunchy R rated comedies. While he's had a long career which includes the well reviewed and prematurely cancelled TV shows Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, his name really came into prominence when he produced the movie that launched the leading man career of Will Ferrell in the 70's newscaster spoof Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. In 2005 he directed his first feature film launching the movie career of Steve Carrell with the movie 40 Year Old Virgin, a movie I count as my favorite comedy, and list in my top 10 favorite movies of all town. After that he launched Seth Rogen's career in the superb Knocked Up, Jonah Hill's career with Superbad, and Jason Segel's career with Forgetting Sarah Marshall my second favorite movie in the bunch. With Funny People, Apatow adds Adam Sandler, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Bana, and even Eminem to the mix. The question is, how did it stand up?

Funny People is the story of George Simmons (Adam Sandler), a superstar comedic actor with many hits under his belt, and is beloved superficially by almost everyone. In reality he is a troubled, loathsome, lonely man who doesn't allow anyone to get to close, and those that do he drives away. After being diagnosed with an advanced blood disease similar to leukemia, George realizes just how lonely he is and decides to start doing stand up again. Enter in Ira Wright (Seth Rogen). Ira is a struggling stand up comic, who does stand up for free at improv nights, works at a deli, and lives on the sofa sleeper of fellow comics Mark Taylor Jackson (Jason Schwartzman, also doing musical duties behind the scenes for the movie) and Leo Koenig (Jonah Hill). After seeing Ira's stand up one night, George Simmons hires him as his writer and personal assistant, aka his best friend. Through out the course of the movie we see George Simmons trying to reach humanity again. As he comes to the realization that he's dying he reaches out to friends and family he hasn't been in contact with for years, and tries to reclaim love with his former fiancee Laura (Leslie Mann, Judd Apatow's wife) who is now married to a philandering Aussie named Clarke (Eric Bana), and now has two children Mable and Ingrid (Maude and Iris Apatow, Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's real life children).

It should really be said that Funny People is not as completely a comedy in the way that 40 Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up are comedies. Funny People is a much more naked, emotional affair than either of the previous movies. That's not to say that the film is not funny, it has more than it's fair share of comedy, bringing in many superstar comedians including Dave Attell, Ray Romano, Sarah Silverman, Norm MacDonald, Andy Dick, etc. There's also some great stand up to be seen from the likes of Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Aubrey Plaza (who steals nearly every scene she's in as Daisy), and of course Adam Sandler. Seeing the inner workings of comics and funny people trying to break their way into the business, and their interactions with each other gives our characters and the writer a lot of comedic material to mine, and they mine it well.

Comedy is not at the forefront of the this movie though. In reality, the movie is about finding life in the midst of death, and to that end the writing and the acting is superb. As a dying comedian trying to find his humanity, Adam Sandler finds a funny and serious streak unlike just about anything we've seen him in. While we've seen him do serious before in Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, and Spanglish this is arguably the best performance he's given so far, mixing in the old Adam Sandler we've seen in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison with a much older and mature Sandler. Seth Rogen, also does a much different role than that of the pot smoking slacker schlub than what we're used to from him. Playing a confidant, assistant, and writer for Simmons, Rogen plays Simmons last link to humanity and his conscience. Seeing both of these characters somewhat out of their element and playing the characters amazingly well is a very nice change of pace.

For all it's strengths, there is one major weakness: running time. At 146 minutes, Funny People can drag a little bit in the more serious dramatic areas, especially when you really want more of the strong comedic material you've seen throughout the movie. In all honesty though, I couldn't tell you what should have been cut to make it shorter. The arc of George Simmons really needed the running time to help flesh out the characters. All in all, I would say that Funny People is a great movie definitely worth seeing, if not in the theater, definitely on DVD where you can get up and move around when you feel like it.

-A heart-wrenching look into the lonely life of a celebrity comedian: ...huh?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When it comes to Adam Sandler starring in his few ""dramedies,"" I usually watch these films like one would watch a Slinky. It seems like it's going to be really entertaining, but ends up a bit anti-climactic. Then you slap yourself in the face for wasting that little bit of time and money in your life. Then, a few years later, you find that Slinky again and say, ""Hey, let me give this another shot,"" but get the same result. Then a few years later...well, you get the picture.

  So it's been with films like Punch Drunk Love and Click. They were good tries, but something always seemed to go wrong. Click was a little too vanilla, and took itself too seriously. Punch Drunk Love was too hard to follow to complete the full extent of the comedy. And yet, I can't not watch these movies if they randomly come on, whether it be on television or someone's DVD player.

  So when I heard that Adam Sandler was giving it another try with Funny People, I was a bit excited. I thought, ""Finally, he's gonna dooo it!""

  Sorry.

  The previews showed the film to be a bit dark, but it was a Judd Apatow movie, complete with Seth Rogen and that fat guy from Superbad. This can't lose.

  And you know what? It didn't lose.

  The premise is relatively simple. Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a stand-up comedian turned Hollywood mega-star. Upon learning that he has a rare and lethal disease, he begins a journey of deterioration to vent about his misfortune, without actually telling anyone about it. This leads to some very dark and unfunny stand-up acts. Seth Rogen plays Ira Wright, a fledgling stand-up comic who does open mic nights and sleeps on the couch of the apartment that he shares with Jason Schwartzman, who broke into Hollywood with a sitcom everyone loves to hate, ""Yo Teach,"" and Jonah Hill, who is on a little higher tier in the comedy world than Ira.

  Simmons hires Ira as a joke writer and personal assistant, and takes the young comic into the world of celebridom, with all of its quirks. A ""bromance"" seems to ensue, except on the occasion that Simmons reminds Ira that he just works for him when he's getting really crabby.

  The story, for the most part, flows fairly well. Those of us not in the limelight are able to perceive what happens behind that bright light that star comedians shine in, for better or for worse. The dramatic intent of Simmons' illness is also very well done. It is because of this foil that we truly care about him and the people he cares about. When we see how lonely Simmons is due to a lack of real relationships with real people, it tugs at the heart-strings. We also see the back-drop of the stand-up comedy world, which helps you appreciate it a little bit more. Granted, it was no Punchline with Tom Hanks, but it was good enough.

  The problem seems to be the romantic involvement. In the movie, Simmons contacts his old flame Laura, played by Leslie Mann. This in itself is not the problem. It helps steer the drama. The problem is that it drags on way too long. This movie is almost 2-1/2 hours. About 20 minutes could have been cut from the climactic finale of the Simmons/Laura story to keep the audience from falling asleep. Yes, it was that bad. Not bad enough to ruin the movie as a whole, but it sure came close.

  I think the comedy of the movie suffered because of this drag. Yes, I did laugh at quite a few scenes, but I seemed to have forgotten that I had laughed at all. References to the ""Yo Teach"" sitcom and the visits to the doctor's office were some of the most memorable.",1260230400,,3838,4.624260355029586

Want to know how many wanna be actors and comedians trek up that path and contemplate the pain of life? A lot!

I have to believe this was a tough role for Adam Sandler, and it was nice to see him put himself out there. If you doubt that he did that, look at his facial expressions. Well done, and I liked the cinematography as well. Finally, some insanely good cameos, with Eminem's perhaps being the finest cameo moment of all.",1260057600,,719,4.286764705882353

I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for ""Bruno"" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it.",1259625600,,634,4.38135593220339
3964933,2,B002PLPQME,"I'll admit that I am a huge Judd Apatow fan. He has an extremely distinct style that he manages to stamp on every one of his films. What makes him such a unique director is his ability to somehow weave together sincere and heartfelt storytelling with a seemingly perfect amount of obscene, gross-out, and often hilarious humor throughout. With Funny People, the first hour and a half is vintage Apatow--witty, crude and hilarious. The second half is where the film takes a complete nosedive.  The laughs are scarce, and when they come up, they're enough for a chuckle at best.

  The film follows George Simmons (Adam Sandler), a stand up comedian since his high school days, who has just been diagnosed with a life threatening disease.  We are given glimpses into his past that shows how he turned his success in stand-up into a career of ""sell-out"" big-budget movies that have made him millions. He begins to reflect on his life and quickly realizes that his self-absorption has left him with a mansion full of things he never uses, no real friends, just a circle of actors whom he sees every now and then, and the love of his life, Laura (Leslie Mann) married to another man.

  With little time left, he reaches out to the people he's lost touch with through the years and goes back to doing the thing he loves most; stand up comedy. Along the way, he meets his first true friend in Ira (Seth Rogen), an up and coming comedian whom he hires to be his personal assistant and write jokes for his routine. The film stresses how truly important it is to have close-friends in your life. If you don't have someone you can truly open up to and talk with, then all the money, expensive cars and fame won't add to anythingGeorge's life is about to end and he doesn't have a friend talk to about it.

  There's the potential for a great film here, but Apatow couldn't quite put it together. It feels like you're watching two different movies. The first half is hilarious, raunchy, and has just the right mix of drama. The latter half is awkward drawn out and feels completely out of place. As a whole, Funny People is a mess.

3964936,2,B002PLPQME,"This was a movie that reached a bit beyond the director's talent level. Apatow for all his praise of his last two directorial efforts, is basically a formula director. His formula is basically alot of penis, masturbation, and oral sex jokes masking the promotion of conservative morals & family values (No sex before marriage with 40 Year Old Virgin & the responsibility of fatherhood in Knocked Up). That might sound bad but his first two films were effective comedies. Not so much with this one.

The first hour of this movie is actually pretty great. It establishes the two main characters well, Seth Rogen's trying to find a way through the door comedian Ira, and Sandler's character of George Simmons which is mostly meant to mock his real life success as a movie star. Rogen is essentially playing the same character he has played in most of his starring comedic roles up to this date (minus Observe and Report) so its mostly Sandler's show in this one. They do a great job at lampooning his career with him but also let him be an interesting character in his own right with the look into his hollow existence and self realization of it. Its quite entertaining as they develop a working relationship and go on the stand up circuit.

The Movie kind of falls apart after the first hour after a plot device from that hour is dropped and so the film goes off a completely different tangent. Now Sandler's character is contacts with his ex-fiance who is married and has children, and Sandler is now focused on reconnecting with her and the rest of the film revolves around that pursuit and the whole stand up comedy part is dead in the water, and alot of the minor characters from earlier in the film are for the part written out of the flick (given a few minutes of screen time at the end to wrap things up, like a small budding romance Rogen has with a comedienne and his funny yet adversarial roommates.)

I don't know why Apatow did this, maybe he fealt vain and show off his wife and children again like he did in Knocked Up (even worse here as he even brings in a home video of his daughter at a talent show and gives them a ton more face time here) or whatever, but for for the rest of the movie we have another one of formulaic tricks, the conservative family values part. So you basically you know how this little endeavor ends. Another problem is that this is way way way too long. This movie shouldn't have had to be 2 hours long let alone its 2 and a half hours running time. Its just too much.

With a brilliant first half hour ruined by the next hour and half this movie was disappointing. It exposes Apatow for the mediocre talent that he is, that he isn't nearly as good of a director or writer as he is as a producer. Its good when he hands over the reins to better talents like Jody Hill and David Gordon Green because he can't seem to handle all the processes at once.

3964937,5,B002PLPQME,"Funny People: 8 out of 10: What is amazing about Funny people is considering its set-up and storyline it manages to deftly dodge a veritable minefield of bathos laid out before it. The story is about comedian, who is super rich after a string of really bad comedies (Adam Sandler playing himself), finds he has version of leukemia and well is going to die soon. Therefore, he reflects back on his life makes amends and chases the girl that got away with the help of new assistant, a thin Seth Rogen.

Yes, it is what we hipsters would call Narm city. Yet this Judd Aptow directed flick is so self aware of the pitfalls that it not just avoids them for the most part but in a true stand up comic style calls them out. This is at its heart a very smart and aware film. What could have been Terms of Endearment with dick jokes turns into an occasionally funny and somewhat touching film. It is also a very real film about real people and I am going to repeat myself here but it is truly smart.

The only real downside I see is that I really do not see myself watching this film again anytime soon. It is a great ride but it never reaches that next level. The movie consists of some very funny bits, but do not come aboard expecting belly laughs.

I love Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore too, but this is not like those movies.  This movie mocks those movies.  This is a meaningful work of art, not a passing fancy.  These are well-drawn and well-acted characters -- Sandler's best performance ever, as it is for Seth Rogen and certainly Lisa Mann.  I love Apatow's sillier comedies too (although most of his films do work on an emotional level), but this is a nuanced and beautiful masterwork.  Like a song by Loudon Wainwright (whom Apatow cites as a major influence in the liner notes to the Knocked Up soundtrack), it makes you laugh, cry, and back again until your heart and stomach muscles are exhausted.  It is also the most realistic depiction of the world of stand-up comics you are likely to see, and very revealing for that.

I'll tell you.

ANYTHING.

Sandler plays a big-shot famous comedian who just finds out that he's dying.  Through a strange set of coincidences, Rogan becomes very close to Sandler's character and...well, I don't want to give too much away.  But, throughout the movie, there are multiple scenes that actually take place in comedy clubs, where these people who are supposedly great stand up comedians are doing there stuff.  In the movie, the audience watching them is crying as they laugh.  In my theater?  Everyone had the same confused-dead-pan-what-the-heck-is-supposed-to-be-funny-about-this look on their faces.  Were those supposed to be jokes that they were telling?

Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting any ""why did the chicken cross the road jokes"", and I knew that because the movie was rated R, there would be plenty of crude body jokes, but come on!  Rogan's character's jokes revolved only around his ""manliness"" and farts.  Even Sandler's character pointed out that Rogan would never get a girl if he kept talking about things like that.  I personally got so tired of the repetitiveness of Rogan's jokes that whenever he got up to perform, I would zone out and start paying attention to the people sitting around me because, honestly, they were more entertaining than what I had paid nine dollars to go and see.

When it got to the second half of the over 2 hour long movie, the ""funny parts"" disappeared completely.  It wasn't even pathetically funny.  No, in the end I would've called this movie People, because the said People were definitely not Funny.",1259366400,10,1783,4.886666666666667
3964940,4,B002PLPQME,"The last few projects from writer/director/producer/comedy guru Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) have been well-received by critics and audiences alike. Funny People is a bit of a departure from the formula established in the other two movies directed by Apatow. The end result is his most polarizing movie yet.

Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison) stars as George Simmons. Simmons is a hugely successful comedian and actor who receives some bleak medical news early in the movie. This role was written with Sandler in mind, and his own film career somewhat parallels that of this character. After getting the bad news from his physician Simmons realizes that the last several years of his career have been incredibly unfulfilling.

Seth Rogen (Pineapple Express, Observe and Report) is Ira Wright, a struggling comedian Simmons takes on as his assistant. Rogen lives with Leo and Mark, played by Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Invention of Lying) and Jason Schwartzman (Bored to Death, I Heart Huckabees) in excellent supporting roles. Schwartzman's narcissistic D-level actor who is very proud of his starring role in the hilariously awful Yo Teach...! steals every scene he is in. Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation, Mystery Team) is underused as a love interest for Wright. Aziz Ansari Parks and Recreation, I Love You, Man) shines as Randy, the hyperactive, raunchy comic who actually has a feature length film in development with Apatow. The supporting cast is definitely a strong point of this movie.

This movie runs about 25 minutes too long, which is a real shame because it does a lot of things really well. Simmons and Wright go on a road trip to visit Simmons' ex-girlfriend who he still has feelings for. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann (17 Again, Knocked Up) plays Laura, and Apatow's two daughters play Laura's children. This entire final portion of the movie feels a bit like a tacked-on Apatow family showcase. Having said that, Eric Bana (The Time Traveler's Wife, Munich) plays Laura's Australian husband, and he does not disappoint in this rare chance to display his comedic chops.

This release is loaded with special features. An unrated, extended cut of the movie is included along with the theatrical release. The unrated cut just extends some scenes and is entertaining but not too much of a departure from the theatrical release. It runs seven minutes longer than the original version. Two gag reels, deleted and alternate scenes, and a commentary featuring Apatow, Sandler, and Rogen are all included. Additionally, a feature called Line-O-Rama is outstanding as it features some of the movie's funniest scenes, with the actors ad-libbing punch lines rapid fire. There are four documentaries in this release, one of them chronicling the career of the fictional comedian Randy, played by Ansari. Another documentary is about Apatow's high school radio show that featured interviews with many famous comedians. The Funny People Diaries is a four-part documentary which delves into the filmmaking process.

Funny People is a very polarizing movie. People I have talked to who saw the movie in theaters either love it or really dislike it. It has real characters and an engaging plot. Watching Simmons' relationship with Wright blossom over the course of the movie as he comes to terms with his own mortality is a real treat. Sandler hasn't looked this good in years. While full of humorous moments, it lacks some of the over-the-top hilarious moments that Apatow fans may have come to expect from his movies. However, this movie is extremely honest, and that is becoming more and more of a rare commodity.",1259366400,,3643,5.115966386554621
3964941,3,B002PLPQME,"Not sure if Apatow is trying to be the next Woody Allen in using the same ensemble players movie after movie, but it's getting old. Same actors, same basic jokes, and even when Apatow tries to switch things into serious mode, as here, it all feels overly familiar.

Rogen is likeable as always, as is Sandler, even when being a ""mean"" guy. Kinda hard to get involved with any of these characters, though. I did think this movie is made as much for other stand-ups as it was for the general public, so some of the inside stuff might be funnier than it seems. So, that's great for Apatow's pals' enjoyment, but reaction from the money-paying public to this flick is mixed at best, and I'd have to agree. Some funny moments make it worth watching, but in general it's too long and too scattershot. It's fine to try to dig deeper than the predictably successful Apatow semi-tripe, but it just doesn't add up to any sort of fulfillment here. But when you're making that much cash for everyone, they no doubt line up to lick your latest script.

The best part is Eric Bana's brief turn; he's funny as hell here and reminds one how much fun a great performance can deliver. Sadly, he's the only real highlight. The lowlight was Apatow using his own kids and making us listen to one of them butcher ""Memories""; clearly he's a proud Dad, but please. Puh-leeze! Is this a harbinger? If so, it was a great run, but you are now the Hollywood cliche you've made a fortune mocking, Judd.

The film is much more serious than silly with good performances by all and has a sense of reality and truth throughout the story. Sandler leaves his goofy bag at home and lets his character become a more likeable and interesting person. The film avoids the many pitfalls of such films and leaves you satisfied and wanting more of these types of films.

3964946,2,B002PLPQME,"There are some genuinely funny parts of Judd Apatow's longest film to date, and most of them involve a truly awful network sitcom Jason Schwartzman is starring in called ""Yo, Teach!"" That accounts for about five minutes of this film; you keep wondering what Apatow thought he was doing for the other 148. The first half involves a famous Adam Sandler-like stand-up comic (played by Adam Sandler, showing almost no distance whatsoever from his usual persona) who discovers he's ill with a variant of leukemia, and who starts mentoring a young nebbishy comic (inevitably played by Seth Rogen) as he also seeks to make amends for his horrible behavior throughout his life, his lack of connections with his family, and (in particular) chasing away the great love of his life (Leslie Mann). Then the Sandler character unexpectedly responds to his treatment, and the rest of the film is mostly a (lengthy) shaggy-dog story of a weekend trip he and the Rogen character take to the San Francisco Bay Area to perform a comedy gig so he can hook up again with the married lost sweetheart.

You keep waiting for the point of the movie to be revealed, and it's not until the end that you begin to see how you're supposed to make sense of the characters. By this point the patterns we see them in are so familiar from Apatow's other films that we can almost color in everything ourselves. A man has to grow up and stand on his own two feet; selfish people will eventually become lonely; a man's best friends are his freakish loser roommates... all this will seem dully familiar. Mann does not embarrass herself as Sandler's lost love; and the two charming daughters she and Apatow share, Maude and Iris, steal much of the movie as her character's daughters. Rogen does everything we've seen him do before by being shambling and lovable, and Eric Bana seems in the wrong film as Mann's studly Aussie husband. The ""Laugh, clown, laugh"" first section of the film would be truly intolerable if not for the brief comic bits with Schwartzman and (again inevitably) Jonah Hill as the loser roommates, and for the absorbing decorating details of the Sandler character's fabulous oceanside palazzo.",1259280000,2,2176,4.802666666666667
3964947,3,B002PLPQME,"The psyche of the stand-up comedian is the subject of Judd Apatow's third and most ambitious directorial effort, but the elliptical, rather skewed characters that inhabit this serious-minded 2009 comedy obscure the personal revelations that he ironically attempts to mine. In certain ways, it's a dramatically audacious film, yet in others, Apatow comes back to the comfortably off-kilter humor of his previous ensemble efforts,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>. Sometimes the balance feels very off here, primarily because the protagonist is so hard to read from the outside. It was inevitable that the director cast his former roommate Adam Sandler as George Simmons, a comic who has become a major movie star based on the type of juvenilia he constantly ridicules. Sandler accurately captures both the demented comedy mind and the innate cruelty that keeps everyone at arm's length. It's a tricky part that has quite a few autobiographical elements for both director and star, but he plays it with melancholic deftness.

The meandering plot begins with George receiving bad news. He finds out he's dying of a rare blood disease and recognizes a need to reassess his priorities. George spots a struggling young comic, Ira Wright, at a local comedy club and hires him to write material and become his gopher. They bond quickly, and Ira becomes George's confidant, the only one who knows of his fatal diagnosis. Ira also has two roommates, another stand-up comic and an actor who has already caught his break starring as a teacher in a high school-set sitcom. Both become envious of Ira's budding relationship with George. Meanwhile, an old flame reenters George's life, Laura, a former actress who has turned into a suburbanite married to an Aussie exporter and raising two daughters in Marin County. Sparks are rekindled, and relationships start to get messy all around. As both writer and director, Apatow handles the situations dexterously but excessively. The film runs on far too long at a marathon 153 minutes and then simply trails off.

Newly trimmed down, Apatow protg Seth Rogen plays his familiar dweebish persona as Ira, although he brings more depth to his submissive character with each humiliating act. Leslie Mann, Apatow's wife, has been promoted to leading lady this time as Laura, and she excels with her endearingly brittle style. In another justified act of nepotism, the director recruited their children to play the two precocious daughters.  Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman play the roommates with their usual deadpan aplomb. The film's biggest surprise is the usually dour Eric Bana (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Munich/dp/B000F1IQN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Munich</a>) lightening up quite a bit as Laura's suspicious husband. Cameos from well-known comics (Ray Romano, Andy Dick, Paul Reiser, Sarah Silverman, etc.) and even comic turns from the likes of Eminem and James Taylor are sprinkled throughout to give the film an air of Hollywood-style realism. The esteemed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00001ZWUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>) provides the film a bright, sharp look throughout.

The two-disc 2009 DVD set smacks of overkill, but there are highlights to consider, chief among them the amusing commentary from Apatow, Sandler, and Rogen, in which they hilariously separate fact from fiction. The first disc also contains a four-minute gag reel. Disc Two contains 21 minutes of deleted scenes; six extended and alternate scenes; another gag reel; and a line-o-rama, a standard extra on Apatow's DVDs where the actors riff on the same lines for maximum comic effect. A lengthy, one-hour-plus video diary from the director is the centerpiece of Disc Two. Other featurettes center on Aziz Ansari's obnoxious stand-up comic; archival footage of Sandler and a thirteen-year-old Rogen; and a faux-documentary on George Simmons' film career. There are also music clips from Taylor, as well as Sandler performing with musician Jon Brion.",1259193600,20,4562,6.202211690363349
3964948,4,B002PLPQME,"My wife and I watched Funny People tonight on PPV. It was better than I expected. Back when it was in the theaters, I joked on Twitter that it should be called ""Funny"" People. While the observation underlying this criticism is indeed correct - that is, a dramatic representation of comedians misses the mark when the comedians fail to say things that actually make people laugh - there were enough dick jokes to give the story some verisimilitude. The only truly funny person in the movie is Jonah Hill, and following his character would have been way funnier than observing the golly-gee-shucks Seth Rogin be the bitch of the I-hate-everything Adam Sandler. Aziz Ansari is in it as well, and he plays a stand-up, but he doesn't do anything than anyone else couldn't have done. Also, Jason Schwartzman plays a womanizing sitcom actor; I think that he has forgotten that he got famous by playing Max Fisher and instead he thinks that he was Jordan Catalano.

The business about Adam Sandler's character being diagnosed with a terminal illness left me neither shaken nor stirred. It might be that he is too abrasive to elicit sympathy, or, more likely, his wealth, which the movie showcases gregariously, makes it impossible for the audience to really pity him, no matter how much his character is desensitized to how awesome it is to be rich and famous. His wealth and his fame - and the women that wealth and fame get him - form the basis of Seth Rogin's character's admiration of him, which is sad, because I would hope that an aspiring stand-up would seek to emulate a comic celebrity because that celebrity is particularly funny, not because he has a big house, a fancy pool, and extra televisions on the wall (BTW: Is this something that people are doing now? Are they putting three or more televisions up on their living room walls? This movie is the first time I've seen this phenomenon, except, of course, for Back to the Future 2). Still, despite whatever down side there might be, being rich and famous is just great. I don't care what this movie says.

The part of the plot that matters is the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Leslie Mann's character. Long story short, they used to be in love, but, after he cheated on her, they went their separate ways, and she went on to get married and have a couple of kids (played by Apatow's and Mann's real-life daughters). Early on, we learn that they are still in love. Thus, the real tension of the movie is whether or not these two characters will end up together - that is, whether or not Mann will leave her husband for Sandler. - spoiler alert - She doesn't, and I'm glad she doesn't. The main message of the movie, then, is that past relationships, while they are important in shaping our present selves, and while they are sometimes heart-warming to reminisce about, must remain in the past. There is no future for past relationships, and that is how it should be.

The other nice aspect of the plot is the gradual growth of Seth Rogin's character, as he loses his golly-gee-shucks admiration for Sandler's character, and he eventually learns to see people as people and to stop feeling starstruck, subservient, and second class.

Compare this film to the documentary The Comedians of Comedy, and you'll see clearly that Rogin and Sandler are merely actors. The movie suffers from the same problem that undid Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Namely, you can't use exposition to tell an audience that someone is funny; the person has to actually be funny.

Lastly, the movie is quite long. I've not checked to see exactly how long it is, but it definitely feels long. I credit the movie's length to something I call ""The Rowling Effect"": when an author is just starting out he or she is heavily edited, but, after the author gets famous, he or she can go on and on interminably (that's why the Harry Potter books got progressively longer and longer). Similarly, now that Judd Apatow is well-known, there's nothing to stop him from cramming everything into a movie that he wants to cram into it.",1259193600,,4069,4.685314685314685
3964949,3,B002PLPQME,"Judd Apatow has been consistent in releasing hilarious films over the last few years as a writer, director, and producer. Funny People, his third film as writer/director, gave me considerably high expectations, especially with the talent behind and in front of the camera. I saw the film as possibly being a return to form for Adam Sandler, who hasn't made a well-written, original, or truly funny comedy in some time now. Funny People is not a typical Apatow comedy and is an example of the director broadening his range as a filmmaker. Despite the title, this is much more of a drama than a comedy and is easily Apatow's most mature effort as a filmmaker.

The film opens with actual footage of Sandler making prank phone calls when he and Apatow were roommates. It quickly changes gears and introduces us to George Simmons (Sandler), a famous stand-up comedian diagnosed with AML, a blood disease similar to leukemia. George doesn't have much longer to live and he's got no one to help him cope with it. He has a large mansion overlooking Los Angeles and he's recognized in public all the time, but George lacks any real human connection. Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) is an aspiring stand-up comedian who isn't very funny, but George sees him at a club, likes him, and commissions him to write jokes for him. George latches onto Ira for emotional support, while never really letting him in to his life. Their relationship is summed up with George's line ""I don't have a best friend. You're my best friend and I don't even like you!"" As George struggles with his mortality, he reconnects with Laura (Leslie Mann) the one he let get away, now married with two children.

The film also stars Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman, as Ira's roommates and is littered with celebrity cameos (the most amusing being Eminem and Ray Romano). Funny People runs about 140 minutes and this bloated running time gives Apatow a lot of material to fit into the movie. While I applaud the man for trying something different, he has a lot of room to grow as a dramatic filmmaker and there are moments of this film that it seems he's taken a few steps back as a comedic filmmaker. The movie has scattered scenes of stand-up comedy that are really, almost ridiculously unfunny. Initially, this made sense as a way of illustrating the fact that Ira isn't particularly funny...But every scene of stand-up comedy, including those with George Simmons weren't funny. And I don't just mean that the comedic style didn't appeal to my comedic palette, I mean the jokes are horribly un-funny and poorly written. They are jokes that sound like they were written by teenagers and there doesn't seem to be a reason why they're so bad. There's nothing smart or witty about any of the jokes in the stand-up scenes. If this was intentional, I stand by my reservations about the jokes because how often did Apatow have to subject us to un-funny scenes of stand-up?

There are some strong performances in this film and you see several of them growing as actors. Seth Rogen is not far removed from his usual role, but he is certainly trying to play a different character here. He has a smaller physical frame, yes and sideburns which should've been given screen credit, but this performance is much more human than his performances in other films. Sandler has been showing lately that he's very effective in dramatic roles and he brings moments of genuine pathos to his performance as George Simmons. I don't think Apatow fleshed-out Simmons as much as he could have, but I did get the feeling that Sandler is more like Simmons than other characters he has played. Jason Schwartzman (who also does the music for the film) abandons the quirky, sarcastic character he usually plays for the quietly arrogant wannabe actor. It's hardly a big change, but it's nice to see him playing something slightly different. Finally, in a film with some very funny people it is Jonah Hill and Eric Bana that really bring genuinely funny moments to the film. Hill has a comedic style he brings with him from film-to-film, but his awkward, shy sarcasm brings some much-needed humor to the film when you don't expect it. Bana is the real surprise as Laura's Australian husband Clark and his performance is the most memorable and certainly the highlight of the film.

What could have really salvaged this film is a rewrite of the script or some editing. The script isn't bad, but it doesn't seem like Apatow wrote more than one draft and he could have taken more time to flesh out his characters and find a better story arc. Editing, at the very least, would have drastically helped this film and if the plot had focused more on the internal struggle of George Simmons it could have brought the filmmakers some awards. I found the first scene with Sandler and Mann together worked very well as a drama. There's a sense of realism and plausibility to the idea that the two are former lovers who still have strong feelings for each other. The scene is very subtle, there are no dramatic exchanges and it was this scene that showed me how Apatow could one day be a very good dramatic filmmaker, but he's got a little more to learn.

The film's biggest flaw is really its running time and, from someone who has nothing against long movies; this movie is way too long and I'm not entirely sure what Apatow intended people to take away from Funny People, nor am I entirely sure what his intention for the film itself was. It's not meant to be hilariously funny, but it never quite takes itself seriously enough to be taken seriously as a drama. Funny People is not a horrible film, although many will think it is just like Sandler's other ventures into drama haven't been looked on with affection. However, mature or not, this is Judd Apatow's weakest film and will have the shortest shelf-life of the films he has made thus far.

-The whole ""Dying comedian"" plot. Andy Kaufman would roll his eyes it was so stupid. It's basically like a fictional version of Andy Kaufman's life.

-The Eminem cameo was so out of place it was unbearable. He did great at acting in ""8 Mile"", but what he doesn't seem to know is that it was a one time deal!!!!

-Too many [...] jokes.

-The movie was so depressing that how it got called a ""comedy"" beats me. Is this seriously the best Apatow has to offer after stellar movies like ""Anchorman"" and ""Pineapple Express""????

-Too long for what it was, but not long enough for the amount of material crammed into it. The movie basically ends at like 1 hour and 40 minutes, however the rest seems like a 45 minute after-the-credits sequence but placed before the credits. I am not lying, I thought it was over so many times. It was like the movie ended and the sequel already began.

-It's not a movie, it's a drinking game. Adam Sandler makes a [...] joke? Take a drink. Depressing ""Yadayadaboohoo"" about being sick? Take a drink. You won't last before the end of the movie though, so be warned.

There's loads more but I'm just cringing thinking about it. Rogen is basically the highlight of this otherwise overlong and depressing movie. So I guess the two star nod goes for Rogen alone.

3964953,2,B002PLPQME,"Despite its title, ""Funny People"" is not a comedy in the traditional sense.  It has some top comedy talent in the persons of Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, and director Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up""), but the movie looks beneath the veneers of men who make their living doing standup comedy, exposing some darker elements.

 George Simmons (Sandler) appears to have all that money can buy -- a beautiful home overlooking Los Angeles, a garage full of merchandise he's received free of charge just because he's a celebrity, and a never-ending collection of young women eager to jump into the sack with a star.  But George has no significant relationship, no friends, and a rare, life-threatening disease.

 When he sees aspiring comedian Ira Wright (Rogen) perform at a comedy club, George asks Ira to write him some jokes for an upcoming corporate gig and eventually hires him as his personal assistant, partly as joke writer, partly for company.

 Though ""Funny People"" is only his third feature film as writer/director, Apatow has established a trademark of creating natural dialogue and having his actors deliver it effortlessly.  His ear for dialogue and flair for inventing colorful supporting characters makes his work stand out.

 This time around, however, Mr. Apatow has ventured into rough territory with a film about a comedian and his problems that's not very funny.  We get glimpses of both Ira and George on stage.  While it's understandable that Ira will be rough and unpolished, we expect that George will annihilate the audience with spot-on jokes and observations.  This never happens.  Instead, Apatow allows Sandler to mutter, utter a few lame gags, and mug as the on-screen audiences guffaw at nothing especially amusing.

 It's tough to empathize with Sandler's George.  He has made his life what it is, becoming wealthy and famous in the process.  Faced with the uncertainty of his illness, he mopes around, leaning on Ira in the absence of the usual support system of family and friends.  He is desperate to connect, but can't.

 Mr. Rogen, slimmed down from his earlier movies, plays the struggling artist with integrity, a quality his wide-eyed-innocent face immediately conveys.  Ira lives with roommates Mark Taylor Jackson (Jason Schwartzman), currently starring on a hit TV sitcom, and Leon Koenig (Jonah Hill), a sometime standup comic more proficient at making wisecracks with his pals than igniting audience laughter when he's on stage.  This is a strange trio: three men living together even though one is being paid handsomely for TV work.  But it allows the competitive pals to share their concerns, complain and moan, and air their views on the trials and tribulations of the comedy business.  The chemistry among the three actors works well.

 Two other supporting actors deserve mention.  As Chuck, fellow deli counterman at Ira's day job, RZA is very funny as a friend who will attend his coworker's standup gig only if paid to do so.  This is a guy with perfect comic timing and a look to match.  He's on screen for just one scene, but he steals it.

 Dr. Lars (Torsten Voges) is George's physician, who must convey sobering news to the comedian and outline the rigorous treatment he must face.  As straight man to Sandler, he is a joy to watch, since he gets his laughs by staying in character and letting his appearance and Sandler's barbs create two first-rate scenes.

 Leslie Mann is on hand as George's former girlfriend, Laura, and Eric Bana plays Clarke, her Australian husband.  Ms. Mann is a pleasant, attractive actress but has a tough role here.  Married, with two children, her Laura is pitched into a situation of renewed intimacy with George, a development that pretty much sinks the film, reducing it to clich&eacute;, predictability, and tedium.

 I have never been a fan of Adam Sandler's movies. As a sketch comic on ""Saturday Night Live,"" he was wonderful and portrayed many terrific, offbeat characters.  But a little of Sandler goes a long way, and when he anchors a feature film, he often overstays his welcome.  ""Funny People"" attempts to modulate his boyish hijinks and have him rise to a level beyond his customary celebration of male immaturity.  ""Funny People"" accomplishes that, but the film itself is unremarkable.

 Rated R for language and sexual humor, ""Funny People"" is two hours and sixteen minutes, far too long.  Scenes go on too long and several stop the movie dead.  There are too many scenes of George hang-dogging it in his lonely hilltop mansion.  Had some of these indulgent sequences been replaced with genuinely funny standup routines, the film would let the viewer see and hear the routines that made George Simmons a star.",1258416000,2,4730,4.9884910485933505

3964955,5,B002PLPQME,"Judd Apatow's Funny People is going to divide audiences (it certainly has divided critics). Those going in expecting a comedy along the lines of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up or any other of the films in the Apatow-verse will enjoy it but not love it. But that reaction may be more a product of the misdirection in the marketing of the film than anything else. Funny People is going for something more emotionally complex, and it succeeds on that count.

Without dwelling on plot, the film focuses, by and large, on the professional and personal lives of a group of comics and comic actors at various rungs of the show business ladder, from Adam Sandler's George Simmons, a hugely successful film comedy star who came out of the stand-up comedy world, to Seth Rogan's Ira Wright, a novice comic who is drawn into George's world, to Ira's friends, who are his roommates, who are his competitors.

The common thread running through these characters is anger and aggression, both explicit and sublimated. They steal jokes, jobs and women from each other (listed here in order of importance to the comics). The relationship between the performers and their audiences is similarly complicated (it's become a cliched observation that comics talk about ""killing"" the crowd).

Interestingly, although all the comedians share this anger and aggression, it's only those who ride those dark emotions into similarly dark comedy that have preserved their spark. The farther the comics stray from their anger, the worse their comedy - as evidenced by Sandler's character, who churns out family-friendly claptrap and co-star Jason Schwartzman's Yo, Teach!, a self-important sitcom (both brilliantly captured in clips woven into Funny People).

In Funny People, comedy is the universal language by which these emotionally-constricted characters communicate. There are awkward hugs and half-hearted attempts at compassion, but the most tender moment, coming late in the film, involves one character expressing love by writing jokes for another.

All this aside, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that this is a funny, entertaining, emotionally-involving film. But that said, in an odd way, Funny People echoes Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Both films are about angry and aggressive people who channel those drives in socially acceptable ways. (Even more oddly, Billy Crystal's horrific and mawkish Mr. Saturday Night attempted more overtly to be the Raging Bull of comedy, and the less said about that effort the better.)

It wasn't until the ride home from the movie that it occurred to me that the ""funny"" in the title Funny People could have two meanings; there's funny ha-ha, and funny-odd. Here, the people are intentionally, compellingly both.",1257033600,37,2743,5.208616780045351

SETH ROEGEN certainly recovered from the retched OBSERVE AND REPORT. He's back to normal hilarity. The movie makes ADAM SANDLER'S character so vulnerable and easily felt sorrow for then to almost loathed and back again. I didn't want to watch the movie at first because it seemed so sad, sort of like CLICK. Granted CLICK wasn't the saddest movie, it just really had my emotions going wild. I didn't want to feel that way again. But I watched FUNNY PEOPLE anyways and really enjoyed it. This is a far cry from his days of BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE. SANDLER has completely evolved from that. He can do these ""dramadies"" as good as anyone. This is a little more comedy than drama, but you definitely connect with his character I felt like.

3964958,1,B002PLPQME,"The critics loved this piece of dreck but the only reason I can see for the paeans of praise is this is life as they know it.  It certainly describes the life of the movie colony.  This was alleged to be a movie about comedy and comedians -- in reality it was a movie about disgusting people obsessed with sex and totally unable to relate to anything resembling life, conversation, or even humor.  Every conversation, line, and bit was laced with profanity and sex but totally devoid of humor or anything resembling real people.  Apparently this was Adam Sandler's attempt at acting but it was a total failure.  He was never much of an actor to start with but this shows him at his worst.  He has no facial expressions, little inflection, and no effort to be anyone but his own pathetic self.  There was not one person in this movie who was likeable.  Not one was capable of any thought or feeling outside of sex, which was described in the most scatalogical terms. TERRIBLE MOVIE",1252281600,7,980,4.528409090909091
3964959,2,B002PLPQME,"Adam Sandler/George Simmons is going to die, so what does a famous actor to do? Go back to his roots and realize the world has passed him by. Sure, he gets the ladies, a large house, and a ton of money/great stuff, but he lost his love to his selfishness, and he has no real friends. Enter Seth Rogen, a struggling comedian who's simply not funny, and happens to be in the right place at the right time to be Simmons's right hand man/joke writer. That's only the first half hour, and trust me, it only gets more tedious and unwelcome after that.

It's always a bad idea to set an expectation in a movie title, and 'Funny People' burns in this regard. There's a lot of comedy, but there's very little funny. In fact, when Eminem & Ray Romano provide what is probably the film's funniest moment (James Taylor comes a close second), you have a serious problem. I tend to surround myself with a lot of stand-up comedy, and in studying the comics of today I get a general idea of what works and what doesn't. Guess what, Funny People's comedy doesn't work. Whether it's cameos, Jonah Hill, Adam Sandler, or Seth Rogen, they all come off very awkward and not funny, at all. Another very awkward/uncalled for scene is the one you may have seen in the ads with Sandler brutally roasting a European guy. As someone who also makes some pretty racy jokes, even I found this scene squeamishly uncomfortable.

At one point, Sandler chides Rogen's character for using too many d**k jokes because it guarantees chicks won't sleep with you. Apatow should have taken this advice because 95% of the jokes in this movie are about the d**k, and when he's going for this striking personal drama about Sandler stricken with cancer, all emotion is lost with these jokes. It's just uncalled for, and sort of kills the momentum & the movie. No I'm not prudish, I just don't think it works in this context.

This brings us to the drama/story. I learned two things from this movie. Everybody in Hollywood is a large a-hole because they let the fame go to their head, or you'll become an a-hole because you want the fame. Make no mistake about it, at some point in this film every character is an a-hole. This not only turns you off from liking the characters, but I found myself cringing or shaking my head several times in this movie because they're just so dumb, or such a-holes. Again, it's awkward. Sandler's character alone starts off an a-hole, gets better, becomes a large a-hole, then comes back down again.

Casting is a rather mixed bag. Adam Sandler gives his 2nd best performance (his scene as an old man in 'Click' still wins me over), and the role is almost perfect for him. Sandler's done a lot of stupid movies like the character, and he knows comedy, drama, and being an a-hole. Rogen on the other hand was awful in his stand-up persona, then balanced throughout the film between being a jerk and being the voice of reason for George. In the end, Rogen couldn't win me over to like his character. I personally thought Leslie Mann's best scene was when Sandler went down on her. Besides that, it's always a mistake for the director to cast his wife, and by the time the character shows up in the movie it had already worn out it's welcome, and she helps run it into the ground. Jason Schwartzman also gives a good performance as a jerk, and Jonah Hill is just underused. Eric Bana? Could've done without him.

After leaving the theater, I was deeply depressed & conflicted over the movie, then as soon as I looked at my iPod my mind sprang to John Mayer's ""In Repair."" Listening to this song was really the missing piece for me since it describes George Simmons. He's in repair at the end of the film, he's not together but he's getting there. It certainly works better than a b-side John Lennon track. Still, with the exception of a few moments in the film & the last five minutes, I found little I liked about the film & it still left me rather depressed.

If anything 'Funny People' is proof for me that Judd Apatow is purely lightning in a bottle. It worked in '40-year old virgin,' and to a lesser extent 'Knocked Up,' but aside from these, and displayed prominently in this movie Apatow's is a good producer, a hit & miss writer, and an atrocious director. It's painfully obvious Apatow fully expected the drama and comedy elements to mesh together, but they never did thanks in part to a barage of d**k jokes and as a result I was wanting to leave the theater over 40 minutes before the film ended. 'Funny People' is just too moody/messy to recommend.",1250640000,,4547,4.505454545454546

If this had been on DVD, I would have shut it off within the first 20 minutes.  Even my rude, crude, and socially unacceptable husband didn't find it amusing.

Why?

Way too many references to male genetalia.  And it's hard to get the gist of a movie when you have to mentally filter the four-letter words. (Come on, Sandler, you're over 40 now - it's not cool anymore!)

I think Adam Sandler has seen his better days.  He can't run with the young dogs; and trying to just makes him look...well, like an idiot.

But his new search for love and happiness ends up going astray when he and Ira visit an ex-girlfriend in San Francisco.

I've been a fan of Apatow since his ""Freaks and Geeks"" days. So I appreciate this effort to add some emotional depth to his usual comedic style of film making. The first 1 1/2 hours works great. The characters are well developed and it contains some big laughs. But the trip to see the ex drags in spots and makes the movie longer than it should have been. With some better editing this film could have been a classic. But the end result here is something that shoots for the moon and only partially succeeds.",1250294400,,946,4.597633136094674
3964962,5,B002PLPQME,"Don't let anyone tell you differently.  At center, this is a movie about a man with a deadly illness and the theme and plot revolve around can a deadly illness transform one man's character so that he is a better human being.  Yes, there is stand up comedy galore but it is secondary to that deadly illness thrust. So if this premise turns you off, think again about going to see it.

Prior to this film, I have generally not liked Adam Sandler's films.  The exception was PUNCH DRUNK LOVE, which was done with a first rate director, Paul Thomas Anderson.  This film was also done with a first rate writer and director, Judd Apatow, and it shows. Virtually everyone in this film is a stand-up comic.  Sandler plays George, who is both a stand-up comic and a film star, just like Sandler himself. The film starts with George (Sandler) receiving a medical diagnosis, that he has a rare form of leukemia that will not even respond to conventional chemo or radiation.  The only thing that can be done for him is to put him in a new clinical trial using new drugs.

With this terrible diagnosis,  George evaluates his personal life, which is a complete vacuum.  He has no friends.  He just hangs around with other comics, all of them specializing in insulting one another continually. He lost the one girl he was in love with due to his cheating.  As he puts it, when you are a major star, everyone wants to hook up with you and it is impossible to say no.  He certainly didn't say no.

So he makes a best friend, Ira (Seth Rogen), another comic, who isn't making it.  He also reconnects with the old girlfriend who is married with two children.  While George is ""dying"", he behaves himself with his new best friend and his old girlfriend.  Even when he is behaving himself though, it seems like the most George might be able to hope for is a friend.

Good as the movie has been up to this point, where it really soars is when George discovers the clinical trial is actually working, that the disease is no longer showing up in his blood.  This doesn't mean it will last or that he is totally out of the woods but it is a lot better news than he or his doctor were expecting.

This is the point where George is presented with two forks in the road. Will all this new self knowledge, his newly examined life, be used to improve his life or will he sink back into being the same egocentric, self absorbed star he has been all his life?  This is Sandler's movie all the way.  I've always been fascinated by comics and their very dark sides.  Sandler discovers and shows his dark side in this movie and it is just wonderful to see.",1249948800,2,2622,4.371900826446281
3964963,2,B002PLPQME,"Dear Mr. Apatow,

I would like to give you a gift. I will hire an independent editor to work on your next film and trim out all of the scenes they think are unnecessary or repetitive. Perhaps, if you accept this gift, Mr. Apatow, your next film will be the masterful comedy everyone expects you to make.

You are a funny guy. No one can dispute that. There are scenes of pure comic genius in each of the three films you have directed. You are also very good at creating funny situations out of normal everyday circumstances. Two keys to creating memorable comedies.

But all of your films are too long. Even the films you produce need to be trimmed. In ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", the problem was less noticeable because I think we were so thrilled to be experiencing the ride Steve Carrell and Catherine Keener were on, or to experience the lives of Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, becoming a part of their world made up for some of the excessive length of these films.

In your newest film, ""Funny People"" Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a famous comedian and movie star living in a huge, fancy house. On a routine visit to the doctor, George receives some bad news; he has a rare form of leukemia and has just a few months to live. They also want him to take some experimental medicines, offering him a slim chance of beating the disease. Naturally, George becomes introspective and quiet, facing his large empty house, he begins to wonder why love has eluded him for years. Then he decides to start doing stand up again, visiting various comedy clubs only too happy to have a star of his stature drop in for a set. Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) is a struggling stand-up who lives with Leo (Jonah Hill) and Mark (Jason Schwartzmann). Mark just landed a highly lucrative gig on a television sitcom called ""Yo, Teach!""  and can't resist leaving his paychecks on Ira's pillow. One night, Ira is thrilled to receive the news he will be able to perform for 10 minutes (double the usual) at a comedy club. Just as he is about to go on, he learns that George Simmons has shown up and wants to go on. Ira has been bumped again. George fails to impress the audience. Ira watches from the wings and when he goes on, he does some material on George's set, which George, in turn, watches. George asks Ira to write some jokes for him, for an upcoming appearance and the two begin a relationship. Eventually, George asks Ira to become his assistant and shares the news of his illness with Ira. But George has other unfinished business; he pines for Laura (Leslie Mann) a girlfriend who broke up with him and moved to Northern California. He tries to contact her, but she is still very bitter and has a husband (Eric Bana) and two kids. Eventually, George and Ira drive up to San Francisco for a gig and Marin, where Laura lives, is just a hop, skip and a jump away.

When the story centers on a bunch of comics, the film is funny and introspective. When the story tries to turn more dramatic, and centers on all of the unrequited loves in George's life, it becomes less interesting, slightly maudlin and incredibly slow.

There are certain comedians I can only take in small doses and Sandler is one of those. In his typical Sandler films, his characters are far too broad and over the top to make them remotely believable or engaging. In his two non-typical films, ""Punch Drunk Love"" and now ""Funny People"", he works with directors who know their craft and can help him create something more real, less broad, and more dramatic. Of course, if you ask an Adam Sandler fan about these films, they hate them because they don't contain the frat boy humor, the antics the comedian is so well known for. That is exactly why I appreciate them more.

I think the key difference between ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Funny People"" is that his first two films dealt with the lives of 'normal' people; a service tech in an electronics store, a woman working her way up at a basic cable channel. These are people we can relate to, people who make sense to us. Because of this, Mr. Apatow, you have to work less to help us identify with them. You can concentrate your efforts on making them interesting and crazy and funny. You can reveal all of their foibles and idiosyncrasies and we can identify with them.

In ""Funny People"", you set up George Simmons as a famous film comedian, the type who commands $20 million dollar paydays. He learns he may be dying. He has remorse and sets about making his life better. Even though Simmons is dying, Sandler has to work that much harder to make us feel anything for him, and it is all but impossible to identify with him. This is a problem as he is the main character and we should want to follow him on his journey.

I think you want us to substitute our feelings to Ira and his crew and expect them to become our surrogates in this story. Ira becomes associated with George, the public can identify with George through Ira, and we're all set. But that isn't exactly right. Ira is a struggling comedian, but he never really seems to struggle. He's living with his buddy who just landed a job on a network sitcom and he never seems to want for anything. Sure, he is extremely amazed when George hands him a few thousand dollars, his payment for writing the jokes for him, but once Ira enters George's world, he becomes a part of this and the struggle seems to end.

It also doesn't help that despite all of George's protests and ruminations about how he wants to change his life, little happens and he doesn't seem to make any changes. He talks a lot about Laura and even meets with her a few times. Then, when they travel to San Francisco, she invites them over to dinner and they meet her two little girls. And so on and so forth...

This brings me to the other problem with ""Funny People"". It's too long. Way tooo long. It is interminably long. Worse, this could have been easily remedied by some good editing (of both the screenplay and the film) and the end result would have been so, so much better. After George asks Ira to become his assistant, there are at least two conversations about Ira selling George's cars on Ebay and donating the proceeds to charity. Why? We don't ever see the cars and yet they keep talking about it. George decides he wants to mend some fences, so he talks to his sister, trying to reestablish a connection with her. It doesn't go well. Yet later, we see her family (husband and child) in the pool while George talks to his elderly dad and mom. It is a nice image, but even this short scene seems to long.

Then, George decides to attend Thanksgiving at Ira's house, visiting with all of his friends and roommates. This could've been a very interesting, challenging scene for all involved. But ultimately it only seems to be challenging for us, the viewer. George walks around, observing everyone and interjecting a joke on occasion. Finally, he gives a toast when they sit down to dinner. The scene is too long and doesn't really seem to contribute to the rest of the story.

After spending what I am going to guess it about 100 minutes (it seems a lot longer), the story suddenly shifts to San Francisco. George performs his act to a packed crowd and asks Ira to keep Laura company. After the show, they go to her house in Marin and meet her kids. Some scenes of both George and Ira acting like human toys for the girls, while Laura looks on endearingly follow this. This is followed by many conversations about Lara's family life and her suspicions that her husband (Eric Bana) cheats on her during his many business trips. It is almost like a second film, a second story with just the slimmest connection to the rest of the film.

This might work if the story were put into motion earlier, but as it comes at what would be the end of most films, it just makes the experience almost unbearable.

Because we were able to readily identify with Steve Carrell, Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in the two earlier films, the excessive length of these films was less noticeable. In ""Funny People"", there are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Sandler does an interesting job, trying to make George dramatic and introspective, but he isn't entirely successful, making it difficult to have any empathy with him.  Because we don't really care for him, you have to wonder what the point of the entire film is? What the point of all 145 minutes of the film is? When you start to think this way, you start to squirm in your seat and wonder why you ever bought a ticket for the film in the first place.

Mr. Apatow, I plead with you to do some very critical editing on your next film. Make sure the story moves and the characters are believable. When we combine that with the laughs you will have no trouble generating, I am sure we are all in for a treat.

But ""Funny People"" is no treat.

Yours truly,
thornhill",1249948800,,8892,4.463669950738916
3964964,3,B002PLPQME,"Director Judd Apatow seems to be slowly trying to make a niche for himself as a guy who can masterfully mesh the heartfelt and emotionally poignant comedy of a ""chick flick"" with the raunchiness and acerbically tinged comedy of a ""guy movie."" This film is not so much a step forward in that direction as it is an excuse for him to get his family and friends in a movie that tries, emphasis on ""tries,"" to point out the importance of family.

Adam Sandler co-stars w/ Seth Rogen in ""what-if"" scenarios of their own lives. Sandler plays a version of himself that never got married and had kids but instead went the route of lonely movie-star bachelor. Rogen plays a version of himself that went out to Hollywood and started as a stand-up rather than a comedic actor. Both characters are flawed and in some cases downright unlikable, but neither is ever fully developed and shown as a whole person.

The film seems to want to point out that most, if not all, comedians (funny people) are somehow deeply flawed, but it doesn't do so in a way that the audience can really connect with the characters and rarely in a way in which they can laugh with or at them---not such a good thing in a movie with ""funny"" in the title.",1249689600,,1216,4.448430493273543
3964965,5,B002PLPQME,"This movie has Adam Sandler as a bitter comedian who only cares about himself.  As he learns he is soon to die from ALS, he hires Seth Rogen, who is a struggling comedian living with two roomates (Jonah Hill and an actor from a grade B sitcom).  Sandler caught Rogen's act and thought he may be good to write some jokes and act a personal servant.  Rogen may not have much (he supports himself by working at a deli counter in a supermarket) but he has a sense of principals, which neither his roomates or the selfish Sandler have.

Sandler had one woman that he had loved but she left him for an Aussie (Eric Bana) when Sandler had cheated on her.  She shows up back in Sandler's life when she hears about his illness.  Sandler is determined to get her back and wants Rogen to help him.  Rogen realizes that Sandler's plan is a ""trainwreck"" about to happen and he tries to diffuse it as best he can without getting Sandler mad at him (he doesn't want to give up his exciting gig to go back to work at a deli counter).

The movie is an excellent character study with Sandler in one of his best roles ever and Rogen (looking a lot better slimmed down from recent films) in his most sensitive role ever.  The exchanges between Sandler and Rogen are excellent and many of the exchanges between Rogen and his conniving roomates are hilarious.  One of the best films this year!

3964966,3,B002PLPQME,"...especially when it's the one thing I hope would deliver the goods.

Judd Apatow, to me, is like a lighthouse: he's a beacon of light that shines in front of me, but he must turn around and shine at the murky distance while I hope that he'll look back and shine towards me once again.  Uncertain analogy aside, I expressed my love for two of his directed films, ""40 Year Old Virgin"" & ""Knocked Up"", and even enjoyed all of the films he produced; by ""all"", I mean only one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Losing-Veronica-Mars/dp/B001C0JCBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Losing Veronica Mars""</a>.  It's been another two-year gap, and I was eagerly anticipated for Apatow to helm the director's seat once again to work his comedic cinematic magic, and thus ""Funny People.""  The light emits back at my presence, although it seems dimmer, more flickery, and shifting towards Andy Dick.

George Simmons, played by Happy Gilmore himself, has experienced a fall to his rising stardom by having a terminal blood disease.  That lead him on the cynical path of Denis Leary, and when he got dissed by a very inexperienced comedian named Ira, played by Apatow ""Yes Man"" Seth Rogen, oddly George decided to hire him to write funny material for his stand-up.  Along the way, there's a dialogue sketch, followed by another dialogue sketch, then the reveal about George dying.  After that, more dialogue sketch, special guests to contribute the dialogue sketch, and George trying to reclaim his lost life in the form of Leslie Mann-Apatow, which lead to babysitting moments and concluding with a dialogue sketch.

Excuse me for being amateur, but I'm not joking when I'm implying this movie distracts itself from the premise of 'guy gets leukemia.'  The film had so much down time with Simmons and Ira gawking each other, rambling with their friends, and prolonging established scenes with witty banter (like the European doctor scene).  The direction became even more disjointed when there's an upside to the situation, and Simmons wants to get back Leslie Mann's character from her strict Oos-trah-lian (Australian) husband played by Eric Bana.  I thought Bana's role was good, and it did have some adorable moments with Apatow's children, but that family sequence didn't quite mesh with prior scenes; not to say the film forgot its premise during that sequence, but it delves into hiding secrets, unrequited love, the silly games, these scenarios felt out of place. I also don't like how it ended: there was a terrible conflict between two characters in the climax, and it just resolved itself.  I respect the film not relying on cliche montages, but it could try to build up from that conflict.

There's also the cameos, and I presume this film doesn't have enough celebrity one-shots: Andy Dick, Sarah Silverman, Ray Romano, that guy from ""Mad Men"" to name a few; in fact, considering Adam Sandler leads in this film, I'm surprised Rob Schneider didn't have a cameo.  I understand the need to incorporate comedians as a theme, but I think the film focused too much on them, and it even had one moment that felt random when Sandler met the foreign doctor again and joke away during the cameo exchange; the whole scene's like one big wrap party.  Truth be told, I did like that one cameo moment with a famous rapper, which gave me a good laugh.

While on the subject of laughs, the humor here is lukewarm.  I had a couple of yokels, like the sex scenes with George and the two groupies, and though I'm not a fan of stand-up, Jonah Hill's 'ball' joke got a good laugh from me.  Otherwise, the jokes in this film felt familiar, with the usual penis jokes and vulgar humor that are almost too traditional for Apatow.  Granted, I was aware ""Funny People"" takes a serious turn from Apatow's previous films, but even then, the drama didn't quite deliver.  There were a few compelling moments, like the 'nothing works here' scene which had a surprisingly touching performance from Adam Sandler, but when I hear this film will have serious moments, I thought of ""Terms of Endearment.""  This film doesn't have any more poignant moments than Apatow's previous film, ""Knocked Up""; in that film, I was moved with the Las Vegas scene when Seth Rogen was yelling at Paul Rudd for him not caring for his wife, or when his wife was distraught about growing old.  The two films are at the same level of drama, which makes ""Funny People"" more disappointing out of expectations, not to mention the serious moments don't seem all that memorable.

Heckling is something I don't like to do towards a favorable man, but this is the one film I had to rant about.  ""Funny People"" had some charm and it was funny at times, but I felt indifferent throughout the viewing, and I probably wouldn't have if it didn't lose some momentum.  I conclude this review with an issue most people would complain about: the film's length.  2 hours and 26 minutes, that is pretty long; honestly, I don't mind if a comedy movie lasts 90 minutes or 150 minutes as long as it keeps up the pace.  The film does too much setting up and too little deliveries, all due to the verbal down time; in fact, that's the same complaint I had about the the extended versions of Apatow's last films, and this is the theatrical cut.  If ""Funny People"" has an extended cut on video, that is something to fear.",1249344000,,5379,4.835332606324973
3964967,4,B002PLPQME,"FUNNY PEOPLE is no 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN or KNOCKED UP.  The key thing to know about that:  it isn't trying to be.  Some have called FUNNY PEOPLE a failure because it fails to live up to the sheer comedic bliss those two movies provide.  While it is VERY funny and has thrice the laughs that most comedies provide, it has a bit more serious business to attend to.

VIRGIN was a comedy about a shy man who was almost deathly afraid to get to know women because of this giant ""virginess"" hanging over his head.  The movie was mostly funny, but succeeded because their were genuine moments of tenderness and understanding.

KNOCKED UP was a comedy about two VERY different people who get drunk, conceive a child and then decide, against all odds to not only bring the baby into the world, but to try to be a couple for that child.  It showed, in a side story, the on-the-edge marriage of another couple, who were filled with seeming unstoppable bitterness at each other.  There were some sobering moments, but overall, it was a feel-good film that explored some tough subjects but found generally congenial ways to move on.

FUNNY PEOPLE refuses easy answers and ""happy"" solutions.  It deals with heavier subject matter, and doesn't shy away from them.  Therefore, it is sometimes less ""fun"" that Director/Writer Judd Apatow's other films (above).  It is sometimes uneven in tone, and there is a bit too much wallowing in the old idea that behind the mask of a comedian lies the face of sadness or tragedy.  Any film that asks us to feel sorry for a wildly successful, famous person has a bit of an uphill struggle.

But Apatow still mostly pulls it off.  He's got a tough juggling act, and seldom looses sight of the balls...although his act goes on about 20 minutes too long (the film is two hours & 25 minutes long, and doesn't quite earn the ""extra"" time).

FUNNY PEOPLE stars Adam Sandler as a highly successful, very famous stand-up turned movie star (much like a certain Adam Sandler in real life).  He's made a lot of terrible movies, but they've given him a luxurious and decadent lifestyle, one that has also isolated him a bit from the world.  When he receives a poor diagnosis from his doctor, and seems almost certain to die soon from a form of leukemia...he starts to take out his feelings on one of his audiences at an amateur improv night that he has crashed.  The unknown comic who follows him (Seth Rogan), ends up making up some jokes about Sandler's meltdown...and he slays the audience and gets the attention of Sandler, who hires Rogan to write jokes for him and to serve as his assistant.

Rogan essentially becomes Sandler's confidant...because Sandler has no friends.  While he lives a hedonistic lifestyle, he clearly pines for the ""one who got away,""  Leslie Mann.  Mann is now married to Eric Bana, has two lovely daughters (Maude & Iris Apatow...essentially reprising their roles from KNOCKED UP), and is unavailable to  Sandler.

The growing relationship between these two men makes up the first half of the movie, as Sandler goes through various ways of coping or planning for his demise.  Rogan is also able to ride Sandler's coattails a bit, and begins to mature as a stand-up himself.

Into this mix we also have Rogan's two roommates, Jonah Hill, playing another aspiring comic, and Jason  Schwartzman, another friend who has just landed a starring role in what looks like a terrible sitcom on something like ABC Family or Disney network.  The dynamics between these three roommates are hilarious, believable and would almost make their own movie.  In fact, it's easy to say that they should have been left out so that the film could focus more...but this would make the movie TOO insular, too isolated & lonely.  Rogan HAS a life...a dysfunctional one, true...but a life.  Sandler, by contrast, has STUFF.

Things take a probably not too surprising turn at roughly the midpoint of the film.  (If you've seen the trailers, you know what I mean.)  And thus, it is required to take off in a different direction.  Sandler's character, in particular, is given some real opportunities (Rogan is something of an afterthought for awhile)...and his opportunities sure look like they're going to play out in a very predictable manner.  But Apatow has some genuine surprises hidden up his sleeve.

In the end, almost no one gets quite what they expected, and yet everyone HAS been given a gift of some sort as well.  As the film wrapped up, the mood was somber, sad even...but not without hope.  As our two leads trade crude jokes across a dining table, the film fades out on our laughter...laughter that we're glad to use to cover up the sadness we're feeling.

As I mentioned, the idea of the comic as some sort of tortured soul is a bit hard to buy hook, line & sinker.  Apatow and his whole team are very funny people, and they want the audience to ""feel their pain,"" I suppose.  And we do, as we become engaged with the characters, but still, I always felt just a little removed from the idea that blistering, funny comedy can only be masking ancient hurts and raw emotions.  Isn't anyone funny just because they're happy?  For every tortured comedian out there (Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason), aren't there some who are a little more stable (Bob Newhart comes to mind)?

Yet Apatow is also pretty daring in some ways.  He makes us feel a bit sorry for Sandler, but he also lets us see that Sandler is an a**hole.  We think that underneath the exterior we see of a jerk, there must lie a gentler, more human heart.  And there does.  But truly at the core, there is still an a**hole.  Sandler doesn't shy away from that reality...and in the end, it is his performance that makes this film work.  Everyone is very good in the film...but it is Sandler whose journey we're really following, and he knocks it out of the park.  One can argue that his role is within his comfort zone, but from what I understand, Sandler is actually happily married and has been for some time.  He even has friends.  So he's playing the version of himself that COULD have been...but however you care to characterize it...he's allowing himself to show some raw emotion that is occasionally very effective.

Leslie Mann is always a welcome, sparkling presence...but her character also goes places we might not expect.  Jonah Hill & Jason Schwartzman do riffs on their usual personas, but in the end, they reach just a little deeper and find something true.  Rogan (thankfully skinner & healthier...although still a schlub) reigns himself in when appropriate and feels more like a real person than he has before.  And Eric Bana, in what should have been a cardboard role, is allowed to both have fun at his own expense and to show some real emotion.  (And James Taylor makes a brief cameo in which he is given one of the funniest lines in the film.)

So there is much to admire, indeed.  But I can't quite give the film my most enthusiastic embrace because it's a bit too long, and that length feels like unneeded navel gazing.  I recommend it, but I doubt I'll be returning to it very often in the future.",1249257600,5,7103,4.65008025682183
3964968,3,B002PLPQME,"Even though his name is at the saturation point, I still like it when a Judd Apatow production comes to the theatres...I think of it as his due, since he's spent the last so many years trying to make his projects work in Hollywood (I'm still disappointed that the TV shows Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared were cancelled before their prime).  And, truthfully, I've enjoyed a high percentage of his films, both directed and produced.  I've also really enjoyed his two previous directed films (The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up), so I was really excited to see Funny People.

Funny People looked to be the perfect Apatow film: funny and comedic bent, but a serious drama about life, death and love.  To an extent, this is true.  But, unfortunately, Funny People is a bloated mess at times that ignores what it's supposed to be about.  Bloated in the sense that Transformers 2 was bloated.  Bloated in the sense that my ass was numb and I wanted to go about 30-40 minutes before the film was over.  Funny People has a very promising start and I'd say that the first 30-40 minutes of the film were every bit as good as his previous films.  But then Funny People loses focus.  It has a pretty standard general plot line which the trailers have already spoiled so I don't feel bad talking about it.  Man is told he's going to die from a rare illness, so goes on a life-changing path but at the mid point when he discovers that he isn't going to die, reverts back to his old, selfish and ungrateful self and doesn't ""Learn his Lesson.""

Which is fine, except that the film gets messy by trying to force a romance story in the mix.  Of course he has a previous love interest, ""the one who got away,"" who is now married to an Aussie bloke who, like Sandler's George Simmons did, cheats on her.  This relationship is very briefly mentioned in the beginning of the film but it's not until halfway through the film that it's even discussed at any length and from there it becomes more of a romance comedy/drama than anything else...until the very end in which the romance gets pushed aside for George's relationship with Ira, Seth Rogen's stand up comedian who's been writing jokes for Simmons and becomes his friend.

If the above sounds like a mess, it is.  And it's also poorly edited.  There's this weird portion where Leslie Mann's Laura tells George about 50 times not to mention the fact he's no longer sick to Laura's husband.  I mean, it's repeated at least three times in one or two sentences, right after another. Towards the end, the entire film deflates and I can't even tell you what the point of it is.  It was about two and a half hours and I'd say that there's a great movie under all the fluff somewhere.  But it needed to be edited and more fully explored.  There's some good stuff here and some great performances, with Sandler again proving that his forte should be drama and not slapstick.  As it is, there's a lot of pieces to the machine but none of them are developed enough for the machine to actually do what it's supposed to.

Really disappointed.",1249257600,3,3066,4.494584837545126
