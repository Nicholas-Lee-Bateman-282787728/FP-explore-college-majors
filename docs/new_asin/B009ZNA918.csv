5374239,4,B009ZNA918,"When I first heard this series was finally being released to DVD, I was ecstatic! Duck Dodgers is one of the few Looney Tunes spin off tv series (outside Tiny Toons) that has proven funny and witty enough for both children and adults. Sci-fi fans like me can especially appreciate all the references and genre jokes. I pre-ordered it and popped this DVD in the moment it came in the mail.

The DVD set is just the episodes plus a bonus of the original 1953 ""Duck Dodgers"" cartoon; This is fine by me, although anyone else hoping for some extras might be a bit disappointed. While the DVD itself is nothing fancy, the sound and clarity are great, and the episodes are in widescreen, which is an unexpected plus!

However, I do have one gripe, and that is that there's an episode (They Stole Dodgers' Brain) with a missing scene! I have the complete episode on my computer from when I recorded it on its first few runs. Later reruns were shortened, and I was hoping to see the complete uncut episode on the DVD. Alas, it was not the case.

Other than that, I don't have any other complaints and I look forward to watching the rest of the collection. Hopefully, this DVD will generate a lot of sales so that Warner Bros. will release the other episodes, any maybe even some extras such as the original pilot (whose scenes are were shown briefly on Cartoon Network and later interspliced in the opening intro of the show.).",1360886400,,1419,4.492248062015504
5374240,5,B009ZNA918,"I want to start out by saying I LOVE Duck Dodgers & this series! I just wish they would just get it over with & release the COMPLETE series! I know they just want to make as much money as they can so they will probably put out one season per year before they do that. I AM glad that the original 1953 short is included in this set. I can only hope that they include the 1980 (Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th Century), 1996 (Marvin the Martian in the Third Dimension) & 2003 (Attack of the Drones) sequels in future releases. The Tiny Toon Adventures segment titled ""Duck Dodgers Jr."" (in the episode ""The Return of the Acme Acres Zone"") would be nice too.",1358640000,3,663,4.1875
5374241,5,B009ZNA918,"Everyone knows the classic Looney Tune ""Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a Half Century"", one of Daffy Duck's greatest hits. Now they've turned it into an honest-to-goodness TV series as seen on Cartoon Network ! Daffy himself plays Duck Dodgers, once accidentally frozen over time, now a proud member of the Galactic Protectorate. With his eager young space cadet Porky by his side and with the aid of chief scientist Dr. I.Q. Hi, Dodgers will stop at nothing to defend the universe from evildoers if he can actually focus on a mission for once. It's a big universe out there and there's lots of sinister space scum to defeat such as, first and foremost, Marvin Martian as X-2 the Martian Commander who follows the orders of the all-powerful (and admittedly alluring) Queen Tyr'Ahnee of Mars plus many others.

So anyway, the full first season, cleverly entitled ""The Dark Side of the Duck"", is finally available on a two-disc DVD set ! Join Dodgers in these exciting episodes:

""The Trial of Duck Dodgers"" - Captain Star Johnson accuses Duck Dodgers for his misdoings. Dodgers must prove his innocence by any and every means possible.
""Big Bug Mamas"" - Dodgers encounters a tribe known as the Catapiods unaware that they're more than just pretty faces (And fabulous figures to boot !).
""The Fowl Friend"" - A robot named Agent Roboto joins Dodgers' crew, but after a while, it turns out Roboto has become too helpful for his own good.
""Duck Codgers"" - Dodgers and the Cadet inhale pollen that makes them age faster by the minute. They must find a fountain in order to reverse the process.
""K-9 Kaddy"" - In this special episode, the Martian Commander enjoys a rousing game of golf. But his sidekick K-9 contends with a pair of goofy gophers.
""Pig of Action"" - The meek Cadet discovers a bizarre rock that turns him into the brawny Pork Piggler who attempts to defeat the Klunkin army.
""The Wrath of Canasta"" - Dodgers and the Cadet visit a Western-themed planet where an intergalactic bounty hunter named Nasty Canasta tails him down.
""They Stole Dodgers' Brain"" - In an attempt to learn Dodgers' secrets, the Martian Commander switches Dodgers' brain with a mechanical device. Is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
""The Green Loontern"" - There's a new face in the Green Lantern Corps and it's... Dodgers ?!
""Hooray for Hollywood Planet"" - Dodgers is thrilled that he's gonna star in his own movie ! Unfortunately, it's all just a setup by the Martian Commander.
""Duck Departure"" - Dodgers quits the Protectorate and applies for a job at a restaurant hoping for the better.

Along with the 13 episodes, you'll also get the original ""Duck Dodgers"" cartoon that I mentioned earlier making this deal even sweeter !

So this is a nice original series and I hope the rest of Duck Dodgers' adventures will be available on DVD soon. Remember: ""If he's our future, we're history.""",1355270400,3,2868,4.73

5374243,5,B009ZNA918,"I admit it!  I am among those that really enjoy Duck Dodgers, also.

Good animation, and great dialogue (along with homages to other science-fiction themed shows that came out in the mid-60's (Star Trek - please note: Dodger's spacecraft actually looks like the StarShip Reliant from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - 1982) and late 70's (Star Wars - But, the fans of this show already know that!].  Oh, and don't forget the Green Lantern (DC Comics') parody!

A little something for everyone!

Assuming the planet is still here after the Winter Solstice [December 21, 2012 - For you fans of the movie ""2012"" with John Cusack], I definitely intend on getting my copy of this fun show!

P.S., For the record, some nights I'd beat it home from work just to catch episodes on the Cartoon Network (just as I did years before for repeats of Star Trek on KCOP-13/Los Angeles).  Yes, I could've recorded them on my VCR - and stayed at work later - but, where's the fun in that?",1352419200,16,970,4.508571428571429

PROs:

  -Cleverly written, voice acting is on-target
  -Reinvents old favorites with a new 24th and 1/2 Century spin, and creates some new ones
  -Makes Porky Pig one of the more lovable sidekicks you'll see in a cartoon

Building a series out of what was essentially a one time short ""Duck Dodgers in the 24th and 1/2 Century"" is no small feat.  The show creators made it work wonderfully.  Its also nice to see other characters make returns too (the Goofy Gophers, Nasty Canasta, Dr. Woe aka Dr. Frankenbeams).

5374305,4,B009ZNA918,"It's about time a cartoon of this calibre made it to DVD; all 13 episodes of season 1. Lets hope WB doesn't take too long to release the other 2 seasons.

Two small gripes for me though - Firstly, ever since WB released Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation back in August 2012, they've started using recyclable DVD cases and printing the discs with single-colour pictures. While this may sound and also look unprofessional, it certainly gets the job done in these difficult times. They also decided against releasing a digibook for Looney Tunes: Platinum Collection, Vol. 2 like they did with Vol. 1. It appears that WB is trying to save money, and we're the ones suffering.
Secondly, along with the cheap boxes and discs, the menus have also taken a beating. Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, Tiny Toon Adventures: Vol. 3 - Crazy Crew Rescues! and Duck Dodgers: Dark Side of the Duck - Season 1 all have menus that look like they were made using the most basic of tools found on Microsoft Windows - particularly the episodes selection screens. While this isn't a major problem, it's even more obvious that WB is desperately short of cash and cannot afford to give us the standard of quality that they used to.

I'm very disappointed in you WB. Still, the video and sound quality of your DVDs are great and Duck Dodgers is no exception. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of the show or classic cartoons in general.
