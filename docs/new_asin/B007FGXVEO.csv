5082379,5,B007FGXVEO,Wonderful and scary entertainment without being repulsive!  In good taste AKA Hitchcock- and really fun for the family - well - over the age of 12 in my opinion. :),1395360000,,164,4.466666666666667
5082380,5,B007FGXVEO,"Short and sweet, good endings too! Since they were 21 minutes long, they had to cut all of the B.S. out!",1375142400,4,104,4.0
5082381,3,B007FGXVEO,I wasn't able to stay interested in this program. There wasn't really anything substantial. It was really more of a history lesson than a ghost story..,1358121600,4,151,4.846153846153846
5082382,3,B007FGXVEO,"This series was ok, kind of boring but good for the price. If you like B grade you'll love it",1355184000,6,93,3.7
5082383,5,B007FGXVEO,"I somewhat remember this series,but can't place the exact timespan.
  These creepy stories are well acted as well as written. Some are even equal to Tales from the Crypt as some people get exactly what they deserve.
  There are no major stars which I found made the stories all the more interesting.
  Some of the stories are sweet and some are even amusing,but all are worth a look.
 With 44 stories there is surely something for everyone.
  Try this and see for yourself.
 I enjoyed these shows immensely. Perhaps you will,too.",1352419200,22,529,4.714285714285714

5082387,4,B007FGXVEO,An old series with light spooky stories.  Each episode introduces new characters and a new story line.  Some stories may be too scary but overall an enjoyable time.,1448755200,2,164,4.821428571428571
5082388,5,B007FGXVEO,Excellent series.  I really have enjoyed watching them with my grandchildren.,1448236800,2,77,6.0

5082390,1,B007FGXVEO,The are touting these stories as true ghost stories but the truth is they are more science fiction than either true or ghost stories. The majority of the stories are just preposterous.  Cheesey isn't even the word for it.  Don't waste your money.,1440288000,4,246,4.6976744186046515

5082394,2,B007FGXVEO,Not what I expected. Acting is pretty bad - makes it hard to watch.,1424044800,,67,3.857142857142857
5082395,2,B007FGXVEO,"Tacky story lines and I'm not sure they're even real since the ones I watched before giving up were improbable. If you like real first account ghost stories this is not for you. If you like scary stories, and I emphasize the word story, then go for it.",1422144000,,252,4.270833333333333
5082396,4,B007FGXVEO,"As a fan of anthology series, I always enjoy hearing about a show that I may have missed the first time around.

The series Ghost Stories is one of those shows and is suitable entertainment for the whole family. While there are scares to be found, there is very little violence and no gore.

The series consists of 44 episodes (30 minutes each) and the complete series set does contain them all, uncut.

The picture and sound quality are excellent, for a mid-1990s TV series.

I highly recommend to fans of a good ghost story and/or anthology shows.",1421971200,6,549,4.571428571428571

5082400,5,B007FGXVEO,"I remember this series years ago after watching it on the Horror channel. Enjoyed it back then and enjoy it now!

It really is a great show. Each story has it's little scare to it. I was really happy when I learned it had been released on DVD.

Excellent deal - four unseen episodes. Great price for an excellent show!

Really proud to finally own a copy!",1405814400,2,355,4.268656716417911
5082401,5,B007FGXVEO,"I love this series from back in the day! I never got to watch all episodes, but now I have the set and I will enjoy them now! I recommend this buy to anyone that interested in campy style low budget but highly entertaining back-in-the-day shows!",1401321600,8,245,4.3478260869565215
5082402,4,B007FGXVEO,"My mother hates these shows, she thinks they are too cheesy. However, I remember watching them growing up and I find them quite fun and entertaining. They are very cheesy, dubious filming and average acting -- nothing to take too seriously, but still family friendly and kids love them!",1400803200,6,286,4.857142857142857
5082403,5,B007FGXVEO,"This is a great collection of short ""gotcha!"" stories that won't bring ""Emmy"" material to mind, but they are fun to watch.  They are a big group of ""oooooooo --- spooky!"" stories that you can watch a month or so later and enjoy them again.",1397174400,11,239,4.311111111111111
8515717,5,B007FGXVEO,"This series presents tales of the supernatural, each of which has a moral. Found each tale to very interesting, and well worth picking this offering.. Originally shown on Fox Family, now every one can be seen on DVD. If you are interested in Ghost tale, this is one to add to your watchlist.",1529107200,,291,4.509433962264151

8515720,3,B007FGXVEO,"Its a great series for whats it worth. Have to remember its a low budget series, that does a pretty well job of telling the stories! I would have gave it a 4 stars but the video transfer is very bad blurry from time to time.",1509235200,,224,3.891304347826087

8515723,2,B007FGXVEO,"only watched a couple episodes, from the other reviews i thought it would be better. perhaps my expectations were to match such other tv shows like ""a haunting"" or ""my haunted house"". some of what i have seen was really boring and really terrible acting but maybe when i have time i will try to watch more just because i am hoping there must be one that makes me satisfied",1497225600,,372,4.328571428571428
8515724,5,B007FGXVEO,I liked these stories a lot. Others may not be as impressed. Good solid stories. Good twist endings on most. Special effects were a little cheesy. I saw some of the episodes on late night TV .Most were new to me.,1481846400,3,212,4.195121951219512
8515725,5,B007FGXVEO,"This is such a fun collection of ""scary"" short stories. It's good while drinking wine all alone at night, or just as fun with the whole family without the fine spirits of the bottle.  ;)",1477612800,3,186,4.314285714285714
