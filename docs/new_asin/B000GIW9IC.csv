2614514,3,B000GIW9IC,This movie was sooooo boring. It started off with a lot of action. I thought it was going to be a keeper totally boring and not worth the money. I wish I would have gotten it used or something. It was so not worth the pricey price tag. Maybe half of the lowest used price.,1168819200,,272,3.963636363636364
2614515,3,B000GIW9IC,"I could see this film gaining a small cult following based on some of the antics it contains. For example, when the funny character dressed as the Incredible Hulk helps out with a wheel barrow full of pumpkins he does a quick flex, ""and.. tight!"" I cracked up.

It's the tale of a kid who is a talented pumpkin carver (though we never get any back story until later), who kills his sister's boyfriend in defense of her during a halloween prank gone awry. That part was pretty good. They move out to a small, country town, where they meet up with some local kids at a halloween party featuring a pumpkin carving contest.

During the party our lead character starts having some strange episodes, imagining his sister's dead boyfriend is coming after him. He meets a local cutie and starts hanging out with her, then meets her jealous, hot-shot x-boyfriend. A creepy old man is lurking around the place too. Seems it is his land, and he is a pumpkin carver too.

We're not sure who's doing the killing - the old man, an angry lover, or the ghost of the dead boyfrend - but one of the girls gets carved up. Another kid loses his head in the pumpkin patch, then all hell breaks loose and our lead man's love interest gets killed too. I was kind of saddened by that loss. I was hoping she would end up surviving in the end, but that's not the case.

There's a twist ending, and plenty of gore, and I think there may be room for a sequel, but I'm sure that depends on what kind of response this first movie gets.

Pumpkin Karver gets three stars from me because, while the story is clever, it seems a little sloppy in the end, and I never did understand the need for the electricity effect, seems like someone got carried away with the digital effects technology. The acting wasn't top notch either, especially the lead character, but in all it wasn't too bad.

I would watch this movie again, mainly because it had some humorous moments and some great scares. All in all it's a pretty good movie. Hey, I've seen worse.",1166486400,7,2012,4.409703504043127

Going into this movie I didn't have high hopes of a movie that was even watchable, to my suprise I enjoyed it from beginning to end(mostly). Saying that it was the same formula with parts interchanged from past movies, like most from this genre of movies. The thing that really turned me off was the ending it reminded me of Halloween 5, but ultimately seemed an unnecessary twist. It also contains it fair share of overacting, with that said it didn't detract from the movie because some people drinking alcohol do overact in real life so it is completely pausible. Still there are quite a few moments of chessy nonsense that I can overlook. At least give it a rent it is a decent horror movie with some good kills.",1162080000,2,727,4.507575757575758
2614517,4,B000GIW9IC,"I've read nothing but negative reviews of this film; I haven't even found a single horror reviewer with anything good to say about it.  Certainly, some of the criticisms are valid, but I still thought Pumpkin Karver was a pretty darn good horror movie.  I don't know why it's so hard for some people to sit down and enjoy a slasher film these days.  They decry the formulaic nature of modern horror films, then complain when a film like this one doesn't follow the same old tried-and-true formula they claim to despise so much.  Worst of all, they criticize the lack of gore in Pumpkin Karver.  Now, as you might already know, I crave blood and gore as much as anybody out there, but it's not the be all and end all of every single horror movie.  I don't judge a slasher film by the number of dead bodies it stacks up over the course of an hour and a half.  I also don't demand that every horror film I watch explain everything to me at the very end - a little ambiguity isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Okay, so the ending of Pumpkin Karver is a little goofy, I'll grant you, but at least it wasn't written in blood from the very beginning.

The opening scene of Pumpkin Karver ranks right up there with Scream, The Ring, and maybe even Halloween, if you ask me.  I won't give you any details, but I will say it takes place on Halloween and involves a babe, a murder, and a surprise - and it leaves one young man rather emotionally scarred.  So how do you move on from a pumpkin-related tragedy?  Apparently, you move to a town called Carver and take part in a big Halloween party with a bunch of silly teenagers with names like Bonedaddy and Skinner.  Things are definitely looking up for young Jonathan Starks (Michael Zara), as his seriously hot sister Lynn (Amy Weber) has hooked him up with a hottie named Tammy (Minka Kelly).  There's just something about Tammy; she isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer, and her voice is a little on the squeaky side, but she definitely has IT.  Unfortunately, not everyone is in a partying mood.  Tammy's former boyfriend still thinks he owns her, this weird old dude keeps popping up and going on and on about the art of carving and how he likes to carve the evil out of people, and there's also a Pumpkinhead dude who seems to be haunting Jonathan.  In case you're wondering, drunk, goofy kids in silly costumes will definitely die on this night.

I don't have a problem with the gore and special effects.  It's all pretty well done (with one dude meeting with a most ignominious end), even though the whole ""carving"" aspect of the murders seems to come and go.  The weird old farmer dude is a bit of a problem, though.  With all of his monologues about the art of carving, you know he's either the killer or the biggest red herring you've ever seen.  Then you've got Jonathan having all these weird visions of old Pumpkinhead, so you don't know if he's just nuts or if the dude really exists.  These facets of the story do make the whole story a little bit on the lame side, but at least they keep you guessing as to the true identity of the killer.

Basically, Pumpkin Karver is just a fun, little slasher film that dares to be a little different.  I found it more entertaining than many a film in the genre, but it's obvious that a lot of horror critics think it's a stupid waste of time.  Call me old-fashioned, but booze, babes, and blood is still enough to entertain me.  If I enjoyed this film, I'm confident that many other horror fans will, as well.  Just don't try to overanalyze it - it's a slasher film, for Pete's sake.",1162080000,10,3585,4.390909090909091
2614518,4,B000GIW9IC,"Almost every year during October, Syfy airs Pumpkin Karver throughout the month as part of their 31 Days of Halloween program and it's one of my favorite Halloween themed horror movies to watch! Most reviews I've seen on here and other websites have negatively criticized this movie, and while it's understandable to an extent, it's enjoyable nonetheless. Sometimes I think horror movie fans aren't opened to any Halloween themed horror movies, unless the name Michael Myers is in it. The film's plot begins with Jonathan Starks accidentally killing his beautiful sister Lynn's clown of a boyfriend with his carving knife, after a Halloween prank went wrong. The movie then skips to a year later, around Halloween, where Jonathan and Lynn have moved to a small town called Carver (go figure). As soon as they settle, they meet some local teens who invite them to their Halloween costume party. Jonathan ends up meeting a cute girl and begin talking to each other, but her jealous ex jerk boyfriend (douchebag boyfriends seem to be a common trend in this movie).

Just when things seemed to be going right, Jonathan begins getting stalked by a demonic like entity, dressed in all black with a pumpkin for a head. We're also introduced a demented old man who's apparently a former carver himself and tried to crash the teens' party, and seems obsessed with Jonathan in some way. It's only a matter of time before the rambunctious teens start getting killed off, one at a time. The question is, who is doing the killings?? Is it the jealous jerk of an ex-boyfriend? The pumpkin headed figure? Or the sociopathic old man who seems hellbent on intimidating every person he crosses paths with? The ending of the movie has a twist that's confusing at first but makes sense after you think about it.

Pumpkin Karver features plenty of blood, gruesome deaths, and profanity. I may be a bit bias, but I give the film a 4/5 simply because I love it so much. Although certain aspects of the film I'd rate a bit lower, such as effects, I find it enjoyable nonetheless.",1380585600,,2055,4.769662921348314

Now I rarely ever write book or movie reviews (basically I don't) because I think movies and books are to each their own. What one person likes may not float another person's boat and vice versa so I am not one to bash on movies or books.
But I really felt the need to write a review for this movie for a few reasons.

For one, as I stated in the title, this film is a B level movie gem. By that I mean it is a campy, independent, low budget film that nails the B level movie genre smack dab right on. For people who are a fan of B level movies you will love this and it will gain a cult following in that area.

As far as this being a good movie goes it is not. Many people have already pointed out the acting in this film is not good. This is not what bothered me as it seems like people were expecting Oscar worthy acting. The thing that bothered me was how genuinely boring and slow this movie was. The plot is not moved along at all. Despite that rather short run time of this movie it managed to drag itself along. The film desperately needed more character development along with more original ideas. This film had a solid idea behind it that I feel could have made a decent slasher/horror film but it just wasn't.

Having now pointed out the low points of this film I feel as though many of these amazon reviews are not really fair. It seems like people went into this film with way too high of expectations. Like I've stated many times before, this is a low budget, independent film. What did people expect?

Overall, this film may or not be for you but it is far from the worst film ever made.

Overall: 3/5 stars",1352505600,2,1638,4.135220125786163
2614522,2,B000GIW9IC,"Jonathan (Michael Zara) has nothing better to do on Halloween night than carve pumpkins. Alec (David J. Wright) is Lyn's (Amy Weber) douche-bag boyfriend who puts on a mask and scares Lyn. Jonathan, believing she is actually being attacked kills her boyfriend. A year later they go to a Halloween party out in a field with a bunch of Lyn's friends, none of which we get to know other than by their 2006 costumes.

Jonathan is having flash backs and sees weird things associated with Alec in his pumpkin mask. There is an old creepy pumpkin carver (Terrence Evans) who mentions other carvers. Jonathan gets kicked around by a steroid pumped ex-boyfriend of a girl, who his sister is attempting to fix him up with (nice going sis).

The characters have some colorful moments, but they are far from funny. The lack of character build up and suspects turns this who-dun-it slasher film into a lame 2 star attempt.

2614523,1,B000GIW9IC,"WOW!  I am not going to mince words.  This was the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.  The cover was the most outstanding part of the whole movie and I am now afraid of buying anymore horror movies ever, because of it.  Lets just say that the plot was good (I mean it wasnt, but lets just say) the acting was probably the worst, I have ever seen.  BAD F- there is no B here.  This movie doesnt deserve the meer mention I am giving it, but someone has to warn you.  By you I mean those of you who see the awestome cover, and decide that this is some sort of, must have for your collection, Its not.  I remember when I was in third grade, this kid kept having to stay in the same reading group because he read in a monotoned non descriptive sort of way, like he stoled any meaning from the words, so they wouldnt let him move on, even though he could read fine.  This is the best way that I can describe the acting in this movie it wasn't acting, it was as if the actors and actresses understood the concept of reading, but did not neccesarily comprehend the words or nuances of acting itself.  They just read there scripts and regurgitated exactly what they were supposed to without ever giving any thought to the meaning itself.  I am not just talking about emotion either, but every day emphasis on things like pauses between phrases for transition and to make people understand what you are talking about, that was not there.  And maybe they were bad actors or maybe it had to do with the fact that although the plot is easy to pick out.  Nothing else, none of the transitions from one part to the next could really be linked in any logical way to understanding character or sub plot.  It was just a bad, and stupid cheesy horror movie, that dissapoints its whole genre.",1318896000,,1775,4.259701492537314
2614524,5,B000GIW9IC,"The Pumpkin Karver is a cult-indie film classic. It belongs in a punk rock cult-film collection and turned on during a Halloween Party.

The soundtrack is great. It's authentic dirty LA Rock at its best. The acting is pretty terrible, but yet compelling, and the storyline is there. The ironic combo is what makes the film.",1309737600,,323,4.767857142857143
2614525,2,B000GIW9IC,"The Pumpkin Karver starts out with an interesting premise.  Two actors who can't possibly be related (attractive but not particularly good actress Amy Weber and mopey Michael Zara) play the Stark kids, their lives forever changed on Halloween night. It seems Lynn (Weber) has a very poor taste in boyfriends (David J. Wright as Alec). He's one of those hyper-offensive jerks that's so ridiculous you can't imagine him surviving for very long in the real world.  But never you mind, because this is a slasher film, and Pumpkin Karver puts neon flashing lights around those of weak moral character so we know they're going to die.

And die Alec does.  The twist here is that he dresses up as a pumpkin-faced killer (see the connection?) and assaults poor Lynn. Convinced she's in danger, Jonathan (Zara) stabs Alec to death.  What was supposed to be a prank turns into a terrible tragedy. There's something to be said for mimicking Terror Train.  It's what Pumpkin Karver does with it that matters.

Continuing the too-stupid-to-live trend, the Stark kids go on a trip to a town named Carver known for its pumpkin carving - because it makes perfect sense to go to a Halloween party surrounded by knives on the anniversary of your sister's boyfriend's murder.

And so we have a cavalcade for cretins, all there to die for our amusement.  The difference is that in Pumpkin Karver the actors all seem to be trying to outdo each other by chewing as much scenery as possible. There's the drunken frat boys who are so ridiculously focused on getting high that they make Shaggy look tame, so they of course deserve to die; the hot chicks who shamelessly tease boys but slap them just when things are about to get R-rated, so they of course deserve to die; the fat guy who's funny but secretly lusts for the Final Girl, so he deserves to die; and the psychotic ex-boyfriend of the love interest who isn't above physically assaulting her, so...you get the idea.  In short, there's not a single redeeming character here, including the love interest who switches boyfriends at the drop of a pumpkin.

Unfortunately, director Robert Mann isn't really sure what to do with his slasher.  There's no room for another generic killer that hasn't already been covered by Voorhees or Myers, so new kids on the block need to have a shtick. If your killer's specialty is to carve people's faces up like pumpkins, then he'd better do just that.

The Karver doesn't do that though.  Instead, he shows up as a nightmare sequence, skewers and beheads people, shoots lightning bolts out of his eyes, and otherwise tries to be really spooky without sticking to what he does best.  There's also an old man thrown in for good measure who makes a half-hearted attempt to connect Jonathan's father with a tradition of carving pumpkins.

Oh right, the whole pumpkin carving thing.  What that has to do with the price of a gourd is a mystery, but Old Man Wickets (Terrence Evans) is there to remind us that this movie has a theme tied to Halloween. This is a movie that was hoping you'd watch it on Halloween.

Notice I didn't write ""rent it.""  Pumpkin Karver really commits to trying to scare you, complete with the villain showing up during the credits and reminding you how scary it will be when you walk to the parking lot. Unfortunately the killer is kind of a moron.  He's much scarier with his mask on.

And that's the thing about Pumpkin Karver.  When the mask is torn off, it's just another lame attempt to cash in on Halloween moviegoers. It's less concerned about having a coherent plot and more concerned with teenagers connecting the movie to a date.  This trick works precisely once, and now that Pumpkin Karver is on video it's no treat.",1288742400,4,3717,4.693374422187982
2614526,2,B000GIW9IC,"After a promising opening set up, this film falls victim to horrible dialogue and bad acting. It's not a total loss though as I thought the murders in this film were much better than the usual fare and showed some sense of style. If the dialogue was better this could have been a pretty good little Halloween film, but decent gore sequences can only do so much. I do not expect grade A writing from these types of films, but when the dialogue takes away from the story, then it becomes a problem.

Any semblance of a good movie ended there. Not only did the plot fail to even partially materialize, the character development was entirely nonexistent (and most likely hindered greatly by the lack of acting talent); I found myself trying to sympathize with any character onscreen, but the only time I came close was in the opening scene when I almost felt sorry for the guy who got killed accidentally. The pop-up scares were cheap and, after the first two or three, too predictable. The makeup was atrocious. Editing could have been much better. The ambiance could have redeemed the picture a little, but considering the film was set in a pumpkin patch/pumpkin farm, every attempt at creating a creepy undertone was over-ridden by its own kitsch.

By the end of the movie, I felt like I'd just watched an hour-and-a-half long porn with all of the nudity and sex edited out.

2614530,2,B000GIW9IC,"The Pumpkin Karver (Robert Mann, 2006)

Somewhere inside the bland, predictable, unscary mess that is The Pumpkin Karver is a brilliant meditation on trauma, mental illness, and coming of age just waiting to emerge. And that makes it all the more annoying that we got this movie and not that one. But what really gets me was the big plot twist at the end. Not that it was handled badly during the big reveal, but that it was so badly handled during the rest of the movie that I couldn't believe they were using it as the big reveal; I really had no idea that they hadn't meant the identity of the killer to be obvious from about ten minutes into the movie. In other words, yeah, I was going to talk a lot in this review about the disappointment of failed potential until I got to the last scene. Now I don't know where to go with this at all.

Michael Zara stars as Jonathan Starks, who, in the opening scene, makes an understandable but fatal mistake resulting in the death of his sister Lynn (Son of the Beach's Amy Weber)'s boyfriend Alec (David J. Wright). Fast-forward a year. Jonathan's family has moved to a new town after the police cleared Jonathan of any wrongdoing, but he's still suffering from crushing guilt. Jonathan and Lynn are on their way to a Halloween party where Lynn is hoping to snap Jonathan out of his funk by fixing him up with her lovely college friend Tammy (Minka Kelly, currently on TV in Friday Night Lights). While Jonathan is certainly interested in Tammy, he still hears in his head the voice of the Pumpkin Karver, the monster Alec was dressed up as during the murder. Then the Pumpkin Karver appears, and the bodies start piling up...

Jonathan's character is fascinating, and were it presented well, as a high-pressure drama or a thriller instead of the straight horror film Mann and writer Sheldon Silverstein went for, this might have been a real sleeper hit. Unfortunately, they went for the straight horror film. Character development is sacrificed to the (tame) gore effects, leaving us only three halfway-developed characters and a bunch of cardboard cutouts who exist for the purpose of getting killed. Even when we do get some depth to the characters, we get almost no chemistry in their interaction. But even this pales in comparison to the way the big ""mystery"" angle is handled. I'm not even sure what phrase to hang on the treatment of it-- ham-handed? incompetent? nonexistent?--because the flaws in it are so fundamental and so pervasive that it's almost impossible to approach it from a critical perspective. When I say I really didn't realize the ""secret"" wasn't supposed to be obvious to us from before the big Halloween party even starts, that's not an exaggeration. It's not just that it's obvious, it's not even disguised, really. And it's not as if Silverstein (The Killing Jar) and Mann (Trapped) haven't done this sort of thing before. They should know how to write a thriller to make the killer a mystery. And yet they fail here, in the largest and gaudiest possible way.

And thus The Pumpkin Karver leaves me more confused than anything else. I can't recommend it, but it does have a certain auto-accident drawing power to it. Once you start watching, it's impossible to stop until you see just how low it can go. **",1233964800,,3280,4.679376083188908

With that said, there are three saving graces: a creepy old man who takes an absurd amount of pride in his ability carve pumpkins, and the two greatest frat/party guy characters I have ever seen in any horror movie: Bonedaddy and Spinner. Their names alone are great enough to rank them highly in ths category, but from the very outset they make it clear they are only interested in booze, drugs, and maybe sex (although they may prefer each other to any female characters in the movie). These two are a constant source of intentional and un-intentional humor, and Bonedaddy's death is one of the greatest I've seen in a horror movie. He is beheaded while taking a drunken piss, and ends up pissing in his own mouth. Spinner's escape leads me to believe that perhaps the directors will make the greatest decision of their lives and make The Pumpkin Karver 2: Spinner's Revenge, full of partying and Bonedaddy-revering.",1215734400,2,1062,4.684491978609626

IT DOES HAVE ALL THE THINGS YOU WOULD EXPECT IN A SLASHER. THE KID HAUNTED BY HIS PAST. SEX, BEER, TWO DORKY CLASS CLOWNS, BAD MUSIC, BAD JOKES AND A BUNCH OF DORKY KIDS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE.

ONE PART OF THIS MOVIE JUST MAKES ME LAUGH AND SAYS OH MY GOD WHAT. REMEMBER THE DEATH OF ROSE MCGOWEN IN SCREAM IN THE GARAGE, WELL THEY RIP OFF FROM THAT BIG TIME EVEN DOWN TO THE WORDS, WHERE AS ROSE SAYS OH MISTER GHOST FACE, THIS ONE SAYS OH MISTER PUMPKIN FACE. THIS MOVIE IS JUST A LAME CORNY TREAT FOR THE EYES AND FOR THOSE THAT LIKE A LITTLE EXTRA BLOOD.

(possibly some spoilers, but it's hard to spoil a rotten movie)

There's just no way this movie garners anything above a star or two. Just no way.

The redeeming value of this movie is that it illuminates the difference between a so-bad-it's-good movie (such as Troll 2, as explored in the documentary Best Worst Movie Ever) and a just-plain-bad movie, which, to The Pumpkin Karver's credit, walks the line, creating an interesting space to explore. But that's about it. This is a very low budget, goof/flaw-ridden, one-location (okay, two locations), horrendously-acted, trope-ridden film. It concerns a man who resembles Paul McCartney-meets-fetal-alcohol-syndrome, strangely-affected to begin with (is he autistic? delayed? medicated?), who in saving his sister from a Halloween prank gone wrong, kills the sister's boyfriend. He then spends the next Halloween, one year later, dealing with the trauma at a low-budget Halloween party outside Los Angeles in Lancaster, California, an area that Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, and skater/musician/visual artist Joe Ryckebosch are from.

We soon meet the people who we know will be slowly-picked-off victims: two obnoxious party leaders in Toga costumes; a token Black girl (sample line: ""we don't have outhouses in the hood""); a white bully and ex to the squeaky-cute Minka Kelly; the creepy ol' coot who owns the land and farm where the killings will occur; et al. A punky band plays, the actually-fairly-good Dust Poets. Stone Brewing Company of San Diego made the mistake of donating beer to this production, but make no mistake, this is no Cabin Fever (the original Eli Roth film).

One of the distinguishing things about so-bad-it's-good movies, and I know it's ultimately subjective, is that unintentional things get created from these films: memes, funny moments, lines of dialogue that penetrate the mass culture. Pumpkin Karver has a few, such as a Trash Humpers-esque moment when one of the Toga Bros drunkenly mimics copulation with a common field pumpkin. The Ol' Coot also has some great moments where he says the ol' ""evil's comin', you can feel it!"" line and nastily hacks up a lung from smoking. He sort of steals the show, not unlike Sandy Baron's stand-out performance (one of his last) in the so-bad-it's-good Leprechaun 2. What this shows is that older, experienced actors blow the kids out of the water, which isn't hard to do in such an overall terrible film as this. Minka Kelly is easy on the eyes and one of the more tolerable actors (and ultimate victims). But apart from that this is cookie-cutter horror that makes little difference if you watch in real time or fast-forward in ten-second increments, which I had to do at points. I hate to do that, but it speaks to tighter editing.

It follows the format that even a critically-acclaimed movie like Get Out (2017) follows: an opening sequence of action/suspense/horror, then a passage of time (implied or explicit) and the development of the characters, slowly building up to more action/suspense/horror that constitutes the bulk of the film. I mean, we have to care about and connect to them so that we can feel something when they get slaughtered, right? I have noticed this structure used in far too many movies -- some good, some not so good.

One of the weird things about Pumpkin Karver is its overall ambience: it utilizes what I guess is a low-budget film stock, giving it an older feel than its 2006 release date. It's like a horror genre Afterschool Special. Though supposedly set in the early 2000s (when it was made), it feels more like the 1990s. The other thing is that it looks like a high school spirit squad did the decor for the film, with a tiny budget and by shopping at a Dollar store. Further, the special effects are anything but special, including one scene where a slutty girl gets ""karved"" up and it's groaningly obvious she has cheap makeup on her face to simulate a laceration. I mean, we all have seen better Halloween costumes than the props used in this stinker. I guess reshoots were too expensive, no one noticed this in the daily rushes, no one cared, or the filmmakers didn't have a good eye. Having a good eye is one of the whole reasons to make a film in the first place, so it's inexcusable. Seeing this cheap makeup effect fairly early on was a turning point in the film for me when the film just became bad, not even so-bad-it's-good, and made it hard to go on. But go on we must.

Pumpkin Karver then falls into the tried and true formula of creating suspense about who the killer is and what is going on (are things real? or in the lead actor's head?). The killer is a man in black with a cheap vocal effects growl and a rotten pumpkin head. (If you wanna see a truly disturbing rotten pumpkin-esque head, see the great Southern writer Harry Crews in the documentary Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus. I mean this in the best way because I love Harry Crews, but he was looking rough toward his life's end and in said documentary.)

One of the Toga Bros has a great line where he reveals many of the party revelers are underage, but this surprised me because it's a case of actors in their 20s and 30s playing teens. He also says the phrase that people are ""raging on brew [beer]."" First of all, who says ""raging""? And who in their right mind says ""raging on brew""? There are many lines like this from different characters doing their crappy acting, including some gems from the crazy ol' coot who is obsessed with the dark tradition of [pumpkin/human] carving, altho it feels like he's the only one talking about something the others, and the audience, are clueless about. The effect is that it feels like Pumpkin Karver is a really bad sequel to a first film that doesn't exist. Thankfully, I doubt there will be a sequel or prequel, but you never know. Pumpkin Karver 0: Dark Pumpkin Blood-Juice Beginnings, anyone? There was perhaps potential in Pumpkin Karver showing how Halloween is a pretty weird tradition, but it just doesn't come across successfully.

There are some cheap special effects to suggest the killer, whoever it is, has supernatural powers that are laughable, then the predictable climax where we learn the killer's identity (is it the weird lead actor? the ol' coot? the dead prankster? the love-scorned bully? the artsy-cute Minka Kelly? the supportive sister? someone we least expected? yawn, sorry). In cliche horror fashion, we learn horror never dies, it just mutates. But why can this be done well, such as in the recent film The Witch (a New England Folktale), but also done so horribly, as in so many bad horror films?

Cue up a really bad nu-metal song with too much treble and compression and roll credits. We learn that the actors stayed at the EZ 8 Motel in Lancaster while filming, which sounds like a fun place. We learn a social worker and teacher/tutor was on set, which is actually a smart move. We do not learn why the word ""carver"" is spelled with a ""k"", but then again this is a long tradition in America that I have yet to hear a good explanation of. But Pumpkin Karver is like a Kwik-E-Stop, particularly a Kwik-E-Stop bathroom that's neglected.

I have tried to be fair in this review. I made it all the way thru Pumpkin Karver. I enjoyed the ol' coot (who had this cool way of having a cigarette in the very corner of his mouth) and the cute Minka Kelly (who compares eating pumpkin seeds to eating cockroaches -- not sure how she knows how cockroaches taste). I actually kinda enjoyed the setting, since it was all filmed on location and some of the desert-y places outside Los Angeles are interesting to me. I enjoyed the Dust Poets. I appreciate that a decent brewery's beer was used rather than crap beer. But I think this film was in trouble even in the script stage, because a film that has a line like ""Yo, Tams, you ready to spew a brew?"" is already in trouble early on. The overall effect is that Pumpkin Karver feels like a high school Senior project. If it were made by high school seniors, it would actually be semi-impressive. But this movie was made by adults. I would be suspicious of positive reviews, because they may have been written with vested interests by people involved with the film. (I once helped cast an indie horror film, but I feel I was still able to see the film fairly objectively.) Again, Pumpkin Karver is either so bad it's good, so bad it just plain sucks, or a little o' both. You decide. Then rage on some brew.",1502150400,,8543,4.714668452779638
