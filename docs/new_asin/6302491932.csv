472949,4,6302491932,"Danger: Diabolik is one of those rare movies where situations and characters are so completely ludicrous that you'll end up in the emergency room being treated for cracked ribs and torn abdominal muscles from  excessive gleeful laughter. Never mind the movie's presentation on MST3K; on  its own Danger: Diabolik is wonderfully entertaining because it tricks your  brain into thinking of ways to deride it, and I happen to love films that  can do that. One notable cast member is Adolfo Celi, whom James Bond fans  will recognize from Thunderball, but he appears here sans eyepatch and  speaking with a less-than-amusing voice.  Though on this outing while he's  not throwing his fellow criminals into shark-infested pools he does have  the inclination to drop those who disagree with him through a trap door on  his aircraft, thus increasing fuel efficiency and lightening the workload  for his ditzy, shapely flight attendant... One of the movie's greatest  assets is its soundtrack. It's pure 60's. Listening to it is like taking a  trip in a time machine and arriving in some world whose inhabitants did  everything they could to brighten it up without all the comforts, gadgets  and  insights available to today's world. Totally awesome, man! This videotape  is recorded in EP mode, so your tracking may need adjusting in order to  maintain Stereo-lock.  And sadly, it's in pan-and-scan format, so you can't  get a really good look at Diabolik's underground lair with its rotating bed,  seperate showers, gold-testing workshop, and its many painstakingly-crafted  artificial stalactites dripping from the roof of the cavern like the tears of  mirth from audience eyes. First-time viewers are in for a treat; repeat viewers  will  likely end up in the hospital again...",939340800,4,1773,5.180212014134276

He's the reason this movie is so charming.  Oh, those gorgeous eyes!!",1169510400,,147,4.538461538461538
7826641,5,6302491932,"An excellent movie for people of all ages. It may sometimes seem like they are laying it on a little bit thick but if we keep in mind that movie is based on a comic book character, it all makes sense. The movie has a strong 60s James Bond feel to it but Diablolik isn't another one of those crime fighting heroes; he's a suave Juaguar driving thief who's next crime is always more spectacular then the last one.
Like most of Mario Bava's work, this movie provides a very cool visual experience and is loads of plain simple fun. I hope they release it on DVD very soon.",1067212800,3,568,4.220183486238532
7826642,4,6302491932,"Once upon a time films were made with low budgets and heaps of imagination, and this is one of them. Though given a whopping $3M by the ego-maniac Dino de Laurentis (King Kong the atrocious remake) the genius Mario Bava brought this 60s beauty in at $400K. Even converted into today's hard currency it would be hard to conceive of a modern day director either struggling out of bed for such a miniscule sum, or ever bringing a film in under budget. Instead Bava treats the eye and the mind to a dazzling psychedelic modernist fantasy.
There seems to be a common notion that many directors of the past were somehow more stupid than the giant intellects of the cinema of today and that they had no comprehension of what they were doing. Bava knew exactly what he was making with this movie version of a popular European comic and that was to make a film that was fun.
Pitted against a world of old stilted politics, bumbling police and chalk-stripe-suited Mafia villains Diabolik, a cool ultra-thief with an underground lair to be envied by Dr No and every other evil genius, outwits his pursuers time and time again with a manic laugh, a delicious girl-friend and his 'n' hers Jaguar E-Types.
This film is a two-hour trip; the score is superb and the images have a vivid organic feel unachievable with today's over-processed CGI FX. If you love the visuals of Barbarella you'll love this. Bava, though, has a more cynical view of the world and in one scene presents us with a nightclub where villains ply the ""innocent"" hippies with drugs making them dance in hysterically funny ways that is just as an incisive critique of that era as it would be of some rave scenes today. Some things just don't change.
Sure if you want to adopt the brave stance of the post-modernist and assume the sophisticated position of The One Who Laughs At Bad Old Films then you'll get some kind of kick out of this. But you won't get anything like the kick you will by just relaxing into the brilliantly-lit mad world of Mario Bava where nothing is quite what it appears and baddies win - almost.",1029715200,23,2074,4.563002680965147
7826643,5,6302491932,"I really enjoyed this movie!  The effects are very dated, but watching it transported me to another time!  You can see how different things where just 30 years ago!",1015891200,,164,4.620689655172414
7826644,1,6302491932,"Danger: Diabolik had the dubious honor of being the last film ever to be torn apart mercilessly on MST3k. As is the case with most of their films, it cannot be stomached by any decent movie fan any other way. The title character seems to be who we're supposed to root for, even though he kills lots of innocent people, at one point just to get a necklace for his girlfriend. He is played by the villain from Space Mutiny, and believe me, no one can mwa-ha-ha quite like him. One thing I'm not quite clear on: throughout the film, a lot of people say that no one has ever seen Diabolik. However, it doesn't seem like he even tries to stay out of sight when he pulls his robberies.  ...
The villain is played by Adolfo Celi, who Bond fans will recognize from Thunderball, and MST3k fans will recognize from Operation 007. He has a helicopter with a bowlling ball attached to one of its runners, and his leg becomes one dimensional when he falls out of it. Also, he gets the line which was destined to become MST3k's last stinger: Is that stud coming? I forget everything else about him, and I guarantee you will too.
In short, only watch Danger: Diabolik on MST3k. It's the best episode of the last season, and the movie by itself is just terrible.",999993600,4,1246,4.370689655172414
7826645,3,6302491932,"Italian director Mario Bava, better known for his  horror films, seems to be playing off the whole spy  spoof genre, only this time he adds a little twist. The  ""hero"" of this film isn't trying to save the world;  rather, he's a thief and killer dreaded by the world.  He isn't fighting for the government, but against it.  John Philip Law plays Diabolik, a criminal out to  steal billions from the government, swingin' sixties  style! And with the help of his steamy, wig-wearing  girlfriend, no one will get in his way, not even the  innocent. Check out Diabolik's hip underground  pad and his huge bed of money. WOW! This movie  is more appreciated by the senses than anything.  The fab sixties decor will make your eyes light up  and the swinging soundtrack will make your ears  ring with delight! So if your interested in some eye  and ear candy, rent this. But if you want something  with a meaningful script that will get your mind fired,  keep looking.",974505600,3,960,4.613095238095238
7826646,4,6302491932,"This is an amazing little film. Obviously a spaghetti spy offering,
the film was produced by Dino De Laurentiis. It has Bond rip-off
written all over it, but that's half the fun!
The music is great
(too bad it ain't on CD!), and very 60's. The english dubbing has the
same laughabillity as other spaghetti pictures. Not to mention the
cornball lines (""Don't worry.  With this [heat-resistant] suit, I
could swim through the heart of the sun!""). It also has Terry
Thomas (best known for being a comical villain in Disney pictures and
""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"") as a
supporting cast member.
I think you'll get a kick out of this one
if you like ""In Like Flint"", ""Matt Helm"", or
""Austin Powers"". Only this isn't a spoof... at least not on
purpose. And the hero is really a bad guy, robbing, and going around
killing innocent people and cops!
The cool is everywhere, from
near-death escapes, Bond-like villain lairs, fancy cars, awesome
stunts, sexy chick/s, neat gadgets, and the hero out-planning
everyone!
The opening sequence involves an interesting
""chase"", where a caravan of cash is followed by
Diabolik. The caravan drives by, then his swank sports car moves by in
the background like a predator stalking its prey (I always thought
film students could learn a trick or two from these kind of pictures,
the same way the Hong Kong action style has influenced the newer US
action pictures).
Retro-Bond-like 60's fun!  Great for MST3k
parties, or just a guilty pleasure in your collection.",958867200,19,1512,4.8565891472868215
7826647,5,6302491932,"Long, long before there was Austin Powers, there was Diabolik, brought to us as only Italian schlockmaster Mario Bava could bring him.
And it was good.
Think BATMAN (1966) bent a little. Okay, bent a lot.
Remember  how bad John Phillip Law was in The Love Machine? As Diabolik he's every  bit as awful ---it's PERFECT! Throw in Adolfo Celi, and Michel Piccoli and  can ""International Man of Mystery"" be far behind?
The cherry on top is  one of the best (original) musical scores--right  up there with Thunder  Road.
And it was very good.
Action, fun, farce and quirky  (defined).
Always the highest recommendation from me.",949622400,,622,4.811320754716981
7826648,4,6302491932,"What is with some of these reviewers? Don't they get it? How can you compare this movie to Austin Powers or to Rambo or Ninjas? Who knew what a ninja was in 1966? This is a cool, classic, campy 60's caper movie. Who  cares what Diabolik really is? He's cool as hell! That outfit. That Jag.  Think of all the other 60's spy-isms that are present...The secret  hideaway, the trippy spy-rock (great Ennio Morricone music) the bizarre  sets, the psychedelic atmosphere. This movie's influence is all over (i.e.  fellow gen x-ers - remember the video game SPY HUNTER?). This flick is  right up there with Ipcress File, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger and The  Pink Panther as a classic of the brezzy/cool 60's spy/caper genre.",946339200,5,723,4.736
