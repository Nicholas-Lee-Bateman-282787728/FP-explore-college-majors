958633,5,6305009589,"Like a previous reviewer stated, the title didn't catch me.  The cover (I was 8 and judging by the cover was the way to tell) looked bored and showed off a boring deal.  It didn't help that it looked rural.  It just looked dull!
How wrong I was!  I haven't watched this movie in probably five years, but I remember it's magic.  It was just a great, simple movie.  You could relate to Jay-he was the troublemaker, yet often felt ignored.  Corey Sevier is one of those actors that you see everywhere but you can't quite put your finger on it--but he's great!
The highlights of this movie are simple scenes, really.  Unlike most, there's no HUGE event that leads the movie.  That said, it's a simple movie that even young kids can enjoy.  Kids who's favorites movie list upon the Fast and the Furious, may not like it because it's not that kind of movie-but sensitive children are sure to love it!",1088035200,18,894,4.429447852760736
958634,1,6305009589,"I always try to be fair to movies where the book is involved.  Movies like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are perfect example of a faithful adaptaion of the book.  Summer of the Monkeys sadly does not measure up.  I am forced to ask the question: how far from the book can you get and still use the same title?  Obviously really far.  The two biggest glaring errors are the main character's age.  From the book, very first page and very first line, ""Up until I was 14 years old.""  In the movie he is 12.  This is what really bugged me; the book specifically placed the setting in the Ozak Mountains on the banks of the Illonis River in Oklahoma.  Hmm... I don't think that was a prairie yet the movie filmed it in what looked like Nebraska.  I would recomend renting this movie. Buy the book, as it is one of my all time favorites.  Even as an adult I come back to read it and enjoy it thouruly every time.  In short the movie makers did not come even close to capturing the book and it is not worth buying.",1085443200,7,1015,4.122448979591836

959030,5,6305009589,"I can't believe it!  I've actually found a movie that I actually enjoyed MORE than the book.  I would watch this movie any day over reading the book and I can't think of any other books with movie adaptations I would say that about.

So you know where I'm coming from:

- I previously have read and watched ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" which was another book written by the author of this one. In that case, both movie attempts were notably worse than the book (esp. the Disney remake from a few years back)

- I watched this movie first before reading the book.  I enjoyed the movie as a movie in its own right and thought: ""Wow! If the movie is this good, the book must be STELLAR!  So I ordered the book and read it and I felt ""let down"".  By the time I was done with the book, I had already forgotten much of how the movie compared with the book, so I re-watched the movie within a day of finishing the book and am now writing this review after having just finished the movie again.  My point is that both book and movie are very fresh in my mind right now as I write this review.

Now let's get down to business:

First, for the movie they changed things that really needed to be changed in order to bring it to a movie format - esp. for a movie made in modern times.  So instead of 29 monkeys with 1 chimp as the leader (30 total) in the book, we get 4 chimps for the movie. Presumably they used chimps instead of monkeys because they are easier to train/work with for movies, so that doesn't bother me.

Instead of the boy wanting a pony and a gun really bad in the book, he only really wants the pony in the movie.  A perfectly understandable decision for modern family movie-going audiences.

In the book, there's a major part where the boy (Jay Berry) and his dog ""mistakenly"" get drunk along with the monkeys and the boy loses his pants through the process (and subsequently spends days recovering in bed from his drunkenness).  In the movie, only the monkeys get drunk.  Again, while it is somewhat entertaining in the book, I believe changing this was an appropriate decision for the movie.

The book is ""grittier"" - the boy is more rugged, the sister is more of a pain/pest, the mother is more hardened, etc. There's much more antagonism in the book between the boy and his mother/sister (and actually girls in general) than appears in the movie.

In the movie, all the characters seem much more ""balanced"" to me.  The boy is not so rugged as to be a put-off to modern audiences.  This sister is more endearing and easier to relate to (this is important given the final scenes).  The mother, while still a concerned mother, is ""softer"" which I greatly appreciated because she's also big on teaching the Bible and in the book, it just came across wrong to me as a Christian - she was portrayed too harshly in the book.  The father and grandfather both are portrayed less aloof and as having more wisdom in the movie.  Again, everyone's just a bit more ""balanced"" in the movie.

The basic ""heart"" of the book is in tact in the movie, but I believe that it actually does a better job of getting that ""heart"" across than the book does - in other words it ""amplifies"" the messages/heart of the book.  The movie takes numerous liberties - even adding several other characters and scenes - but it mostly serves to help draw out that ""heart"" rather than take away from it.  I even enjoyed the ending better in the movie than in the book!

Now the biggest reason I prefer the movie.  As a Christian, the book bothered me a bit.  There is a great emphasis on a character ""The Old Man of the Mountains"" as well as a magic fairy ring, which grants magical wishes.  While there is a vague tie-in with God in both cases, it comes across much more as everyone got what they wanted based on wishing/hoping for it, rather than trusting God.  Basically the Christianity in the book is a very watered-down, folksy, liberal, superstitious, ""religious"" Christianity.  In the movie, while they kept the references to both (I actually wish they didn't), they're much toned-down and ""The Old Man of the Mountains"" is explicitly stated to be God watching out for the animals, and the ""magic fairy ring"" isn't described as such and only the sister gets in it and she is shown to be praying rather than just ""making a wish"".  With that said, there is 1 scene in the movie that along these lines bothered me a bit that WASN'T in the book.  There's a scene during a big storm where the mother is reading Psalm 23 from her Bible, which is nice, but just as she's talking about the peace of the Lord, etc. we see all the windows being blown out, etc.  It could easily be seen to be sending a message that God doesn't care at all and that the Bible isn't really a comfort, etc.  Almost like ""See what reading the Bible and believing in God gets you?  A bunch of broken stuff that will need to be repaired and cost you money.""  I don't think it likely that this was intended by the filmmakers - it just came across a bit that way.

The book was quite amusing.  But even with all the changes in the movie (and there are quite a number), they still managed to generally keep that amusing quality - though definitely less in comparison.

I do wish that they had provided some closure with the ""bully kids"" that they added for the movie.  The other thing that bothered me some was them killing off the other main character they added for the movie: the old moonshiner that ran the still.  The movie makes us feel something for him, and then kills him off.  On the other hand, the character was a great visual of how our choices affect our lives, and his death was a ""growing up"" experience for the boy (Jay Berry).

Basically, in the final analysis, I felt they did a reasonably good job with this movie.  They left out various stuff from the book, but I believe most of those to have been very wise decisions.  Likewise, they changed things, but mostly seemed to only change stuff that needed to be changed to work in a movie format or to work with the locales, etc. that they had to work with.  And the stuff they added was stuff mostly necessary to help ""tie everything together"" and really ""make it work"" in a movie format - to add feeling/dimension, etc.

All that to say, I doubt I'll ever read the book again.  But the movie I'm sure I'll watch for years to come.  I realize that's not ""politically correct"" to say for many, and I mean no disrespect to the author who certainly knew how to write a compelling book (i.e. ""Where the Red Fern Grows"") but in this case the movie was just plain ""more satisfying"".

Note: There are a couple of different releases of this movie which differ some.  The ""Feature Films for Families"" is the best in my opinion as it is minorly edited to make it even more family friendly over what is in the Disney release. The Disney release has some brash talk and a camera pan on a dead body that the Feature Films for Families version doesn't have.",1335744000,4,6957,4.3602484472049685

959033,5,6305009589,"A delightful family film where the family (including the 2 children) show that they care for and love one another. The boy has some disapointments and sucesses and grows through these learning to put some sibling rivalry behind him as he becomes more selfless and devoted to others. He learns wonderful lessons that any parent would want their own child to learn, and understand. The heartwarming story takes place on a farm, a small town, and along a river sometime around 1920 or so, give or take a decade. The values are exemplary and any child could watch this probably without the parent having to worry. Watching it as a family however would be more rewarding, and I think little boys would especially appreciate the film and lessons.",1309046400,,740,4.7890625

959065,4,6305009589,"I have not read the book, so I have no point of reference there, but I did enjoy the movie very much.
It really is touching, and I thought it was well done all around.
HOWEVER, there is no way I'd give this a G rating. I was pretty regretful to have let my child watch this one, without skipping over parts. I don't think she caught the part where an old bootlegger is described as one who would shoot you and put your head up on a stick as a warning to others, but I am sure she did notice the dead body shown later in the film. It was unnecessarily gruesome, imo, panning slowly up the cold, pale hand, over the body, crushed by a tree, and focusing on the horrible, pale, dead face, with eyes open. I didn't say anything and I hope it won't haunt her. It probably will me though!
I'm learning the hard way that just because a movie is rated G, doesn't mean it is suitable for young kids.

I don't think she caught the part where an old bootlegger is described as one who would shoot you and put your head up on a stick as a warning to others, but I am sure she did notice the dead body shown later in the film. It was unnecessarily gruesome, imo, panning slowly up the cold, pale hand, over the body, crushed by a tree, and focusing on the horrible, pale, dead face, with eyes open. I didn't say anything and I hope it won't haunt her. It probably will me though!

959069,1,6305009589,"The book ""Summer of the Monkeys"" is one of my favorite classics. Reading how Jay Berry and his faithful hound Rowdy would try to catch the one hundred little circus monkeys hiding in the ""bottoms"" (the woods) was extremely fun and hilarious. It was also a great ""coming of age"" tale. When I first heard this movie was being made, I was ecstatic. Imagine my disappointment when this HORRIFIC movie was actually viewed by yours truly.

First thing to notice are the monkeys. There are only four. That's right: FOUR. Four chimpanzees...and they are not even MONKEYS. They are APES. The book wasn't called ""Summer of the Apes"", Disney. And what is the fun in only four ""monkeys"" being on the loose? They even left out (probably for good reason) the extremely laugh out loud part where the monkeys get Jay Berry and Rowdy drunk by the old man's sour mash in the woods.

Jay Berry's sister Daisy, in the book, is his twin sister. Here, she is an annoying younger sister that is so cliched in movies. They threw in a bullying gang that likes to pick on Jay Berry, that wasn't even in the book. School wasn't even in the book if I recall, I'm pretty sure they school at home. I haven't read it in a while, so I could be wrong about that.

They couldn't even get the dog's BREED right. Rowdy is a purebred Bluetick Coonhound in the book. So of course Disney drags in some kinda collie-shepherd mutt instead. Being an avid dog lover, I was highly disappointed in this. How hard can it be to get a certain type of dog on the set? They used the same breed of dog in Homeward Bound 2: Lost in San Francisco, so why couldn't they use one here?

Many memorable scenes and stories from the book are missing from this movie. I had wondered many times if the writers of this film even READ the book, or only just listened to people talked about what they remembered about it and then just threw some crap together to form THIS.

I guess little kids might enjoy, since they obviously can't read a high-school age book, but if you are like me and LOVED the book, skip this movie. It is without a doubt the WORST book-to-movie adaptation I have EVER seen.",1250035200,5,2134,4.3924050632911396

959131,1,6305009589,"My friend and I have a tradition.  We get together on the weekends, go to the video store and rent whatever monkey movies we can find.  Having already watched Most Valuable Primate, Most Vertical Primate, Most Extreme Primate, King Kong, Mighty Joe Young, Spymate and a few even more forgettable than any of those, we saw Summer of the Monkeys on the shelf and said ""hey why not"".

From the moment the movie started, I knew we had grabbed the wrong movie.  This is a movie where a young boy who loves horses gets a gang of trained circus chimps instead.  After he has a bit of ""monkey trouble"" he begins to get along with his new ape overlords.  Things are going great until young boy decides he needs that horse.  After some crying and montages, young boy makes the most stupid mistake a kid with a bunch of chimps could make.

HE SELLS THE CHIMPS FOR A HORSE!??!?!?

Sure, King Kong and Joe Young didn't fare all too well in the end, they weren't sold back into slavery in favor of an inferior species!

Ridiculous.  What hurts most is the lack of respect.",1196812800,,1058,4.402061855670103

959133,3,6305009589,"Set in the 1800s on the sunkissed prairies of Canada, Summer of the Monkeys follows the story of Jay (Corey Sevier), a young boy who dreams of getting enough money to buy a pony named Annie. When Jay finds four chimps (played by Henri, Antoinette, Jacques, and Dominique) who have fallen off a wrecked circus train and become lost, he realizes that if he turns them in he can collect a big reward -- money enough to buy Annie. Conflict enters the picture when Jay gets attached to the silly simians, and doesn't want to return them to the circus. But then his sister falls ill, and family needs money for her operation.

The movie is not as good as the book, and there is a lot less on the horse plot than equestrians will hope... still, it's a solid Disney movie.",1181865600,3,764,4.380281690140845

959136,1,6305009589,"Having read the book and loved it, I looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed in several ways. The portrayal of some the characters was different from the books - and not always in a good way. Jay Berry, instead of being just a lively, inquisitive country boy, was a feisty kid who was always getting in trouble of some kind. His mother came across as a Bible-thumper who was always quoting scripture in a way that even I, as a born-again Christian, found very irritating. It was also out of place, because at that time in many Bible-believing families, the father was considered the spiritual head of the family, and would have usually been the one leading the family devotions.

In the book the monkeys consisted of one chimp - the one that was known as the ""hundred-dollar"" monkey because he was worth the most money, and lots of little cappuchin monkeys, which I think makes the story funnier, more interesting and more original. But apparently the movie producers couldn't, or didn't want to come up with that many monkeys, so they settled for four chimps instead, which took something out of the original story.

The setting was a dissapointment too. The book is set in the Ozarks, but the movie looks like it was made out on the prairie somewhere, like Nebraska or Kansas. And in the scene where the kids nearly fall into the creek and drown, the parents obviously played favorites with the daughter -- while both kids were equally guilty of disobeying their mother, Daisy gets off the hook and Jau Berry gets in trouble.

Even the ending was a dissapointment. The fairy ring gets left out altogether, and while Jay's decision to give up the horse he wanted so that his sister's lame leg can be fixed was noble, the book ending was much better. There, everyone got what they wanted - Jay got his horse and his gun, his sister's leg gets fixed, and everything turns out wonderful.

If you are looking for a good experience with Summer of the Monkeys, read the book instead. This movie is nothing but a sorry imiation of the original story.",1154908800,10,2081,4.646739130434782
959137,4,6305009589,"I liked this movie.  The movie is full of fun and lots of little lessons for young and old alike.  I only have one small complaint.  There are no monkeys in this movie.  Monkeys usually have long tails and the word excludes apes, including chimpanzees.  My complaint comes because too many people already think of gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees as monkeys, and children should learn better.

Jay Berry Lee (Cory Savier) is a young boy on the Great Plains just past the turn of the century.  Jay Berry has his heart set on a beautiful mare.  However, money is tight and Jay Berry quickly realizes that working Grandpa Sam Ferrans's (Wilford Brimley) store will not earn him money as fast as he would like.  Help comes in the form of a troop of chimpanzees.

A circus train derailed near town, and now their owner is searching for them.  Jay Berry accidentally finds the chimps in the ""bottoms,"" where he is not supposed to go.  The bottoms are adjacent to a river, and the land is marshy and treacherous, and scary-looking moon shiner Bayliss Hatcher (Don Francks, a veteran of dozens of television and movie appearances) makes his home there.

The movie alternates between the life that his parents, John Lee (Michael Ontkean, a veteran actor that has worked with Disney before) and Sara Lee (Leslie Hope, another veteran actor) think Jay Berry should prepare for, and the fantasies that Jay Berry seems to have.  Thrown into this mix is that Jay Berry's sister, Daisy Lee (Katie Stuart), is handicapped and relies on Jay Berry a lot.  Perhaps is would be more accurate to say that Jay Berry's parents rely on Jay Berry to watch over his younger sister.

Through the movie, we watch as Jay Berry fights with himself over the meaning of right and wrong.  We watch Jay Berry get into situations that always seem to happen to us when we are young.  While we would like to save Jay Berry, we also know that Jay Berry must conquer these situations on his own in order to grow up.

This movie does fall into the category of a ""coming of age"" movie.  However, the use of the chimpanzees as a tool to aid in that growing up and the era in which the movie make this movie an enjoyable experience.  I have watched this movie twice now.  The second time I watched it I appreciated it better than the first time, which I usually find to be a good sign.

This movie was based on a book with the same title by Wilson Rawls.  However, I have not read the book.  Other reviewers have noted that the movie follows the book poorly, and have criticized the movie for its divergence.  If you have read the book and you think you might be disappointed if the movie departs significantly from the book, you may wish to pass this movie by.  If have not read the book and you like coming of age stories or family movies in general, then this movie will likely appeal to you.

This movie has some stylistic similarities to the Wilderness Family movies of the mid to late 70s, and if you liked those movies you would probably like this movie.

I think this movie is an excellent choice for a family film collection.  There are a few tense moments, but those moments are short and this movie should be fine for even the youngest members of the family.  Enjoy!",1154822400,4,3238,4.493150684931507
