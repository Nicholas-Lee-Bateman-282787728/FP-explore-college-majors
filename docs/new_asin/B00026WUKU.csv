8023028,5,B00026WUKU,"a bully for binky - when I get Lost at sea with arthur , buster  binky, rattles, carlos,bo, molly, andthe brain.  this was written by my son with autism when he was 5.  he loved the book, just wanted to let his words stay.  It was a good book for him to begin learning stories instead of memorizing the telephone book.

My other Son Liam with autism loves Arthur too, but he can't read or speak and he treasures these books. They are stacked up next to his bed.
I hope you like it too!~",1125014400,,486,4.073684210526316
