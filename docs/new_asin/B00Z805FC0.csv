8719598,1,B00Z805FC0,"This was the worst movie. It contained a series of badly shot stills and poor recorded video. Many of the featured landmarks had garbage cans and dumpsters blocking the views. The music was the same loop that took up the first half, then suddenly changed to others. Last, the narration was a computer voice with English accent reading in a monotone cadence. Serious you would have to try really hard to make a movie this bad. We had hoped to see modern Palm Springs but instead we saw a tram ride up a desert mountain.",1489968000,,518,4.463157894736842
8719599,5,B00Z805FC0,"I loved the Video.  It gave one full hour of over view of LA, Santa Monica beach and Palm Springs.  I didn't realize how beautiful Palm Springs were until I saw this Video.  Must buy for someone visiting the area.",1437955200,,213,4.275
