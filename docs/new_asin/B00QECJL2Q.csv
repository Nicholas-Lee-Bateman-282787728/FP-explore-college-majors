6866209,5,B00QECJL2Q,"I laughed, I cried and was thrilled that it had a great ending. I really liked and enjoy the work of the two lead actors Jang; right along with the supporting cast, especially Grandma Wang and Secretary Tak. I was laughing right along with Gun, they all had me laughing out loud and they were all fantastic. It is by far my favorite Korean Drama.",1445299200,3,346,4.338461538461538

6866213,5,B00QECJL2Q,"A fun story. The actors are interesting characters-with some silliness. The  Jang Hyuk laugh annoys some but it is part of the character as a nervous laugh. Some endearing moments and sad ones, too. Engaging and heartwarming.
A favorite comedy.",1438992000,,244,5.1
6866214,5,B00QECJL2Q,"It is a comedy but has lots of emotional drama and all. When I watched it, it felt as if there were two stories in one. The first part ends when the main female character goes to study Arts in France. The second part is more a drama than a comedy and some episodes will just make you cry.

I did not like much the main male character but the actor is really good. The actors in this drama are, as noted by another reviewer, light years better than any American or Western actors indeed. They are superbly talented.

I particularly loved the episode 17 and the music is just incredibly in synch with the story (Ailee, singing ""Goodbye my love"", won the Best Soundtrack Award at the 2014 Korean Drama Festival). This is when the main female character finds out how much and how truly she is loved.

There are funny parts like scene parodies of other Korean movies, like The Classic's scene of the couple running in the rain with the exact same song playing in the background and many references to other Korean TV series.

I highly recommend this one. The subtitles are mostly good with some acceptable mistakes, but this does not compromise the understanding of the dialogues, which are also very good.",1437523200,3,1201,4.52073732718894
6866215,2,B00QECJL2Q,Too many ads that was distracting,1436659200,,33,4.666666666666667
6866216,5,B00QECJL2Q,"The characters in this soap opera are people you would enjoy hang out with in real life.  It is PG rated, nothing like USA soap operas. If you watch it several times, you will find you know what they are saying without reading the subtitles and you can concentrate on their faces.  US actors are wooden puppets compared the these actors.",1435276800,5,337,4.508196721311475
6866217,5,B00QECJL2Q,"I love this KDrama!  Now I can watch it forever whenever I want.  I find the English subtitles a bit large, but when my eye sight goes, it will be ok - LOL!",1433289600,2,156,3.696969696969697
6866218,5,B00QECJL2Q,"I saw this movie on a video streaming service and became hooked so I had to purchase it for my personal library.  I've watched the series 3 times already and fall in love with it more each time.  It is a truly wonderful and compelling story that masterfully weaves comedy, drama, sacrifice, and romance.  Although it is in Korean, the story transcending nationalities, language and race.  It tells the unexpected love story between a quirky, successful but lonely CEO and a kindhearted but often overlooked office worker.  The two primary characters meet over the weekend under trying circumstances (failed proposal and cheating lover).  The events of the weekend lay the ground work for the remainder of the 20 episode series weaving in stories of unexpected pregnancy, corporate espionage and sabotage, familial difficulties and problems, class struggles, genetic health problems, the lose of a child, and romantic love triangles.  Each approximate 60 minute episode will leave you wondering what will happen next, something quite unique in today's storytelling environment. (I was 11 episodes in before I realized it.) The chemistry that the main characters share and display throughout the movie is amazing.  The acting by all cast members is superb. I absolutely fell in love with the entire supporting cast.  Their supporting roles help to give depth and dimension to the story and provides the right amount of levity and humor...hamo, hamo!  After watching the series, you'll completely understand and appreciate that reference.",1429660800,8,1535,5.305785123966942
8691060,5,B00QECJL2Q,I love this story and the actors. I have had this for about 2 weeks and have already watched it twice. I laugh part of the time and have tears part of the time while watching it. It's everything I could ask for.,1503964800,,211,3.9302325581395348

8691063,1,B00QECJL2Q,"I am not sure about this drama.  I have mixed feelings.  I love Jang Hyuk, always easy on the eyes, that is why I bought it.  I loved the first drama that Nara and Hyuk starred on and I thought this would be just as good.  HOWEVER, while watching this drama, many times  I thought this drama was a direct transfer from the TV transmission.  There is an episode which shows what looks like election results.... Another problem is that the translation is white font and this made it really hard to read at times.  Now, one thing that I could not understand is that there is no continuity in the appearance of Hyuk.  First he shows up with short hair, then in the middle of the story, his hair is long, then short again.  The drama does not explain any of this.  Also at times, the drama got really silly and hard to believe. It looked like the director was trying to extend the drama with unnecessary scenes.  I would not recommend this drama.",1455840000,,941,4.32
