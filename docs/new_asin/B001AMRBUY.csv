8278060,4,B001AMRBUY,"Available in either VHS video or DVD formats, this 32-minute instruction is perfect for the beginning upright bass player. What better way to learn than from IBMA's Bass Player of the Year for 1998-2001? Missy Raines' seven short lessons cover left and right hand positions, the fingerboard, scales, intervals, I-IV-V progression, timing and tips. She'll tell you such things as how important it is to rest the bass against the mass of your body to get good tone, relieve pressure, and avoid injury. There are tips about how to carry the bass, understand elementary music theory and a major scale, and the proper way to hold the instrument to deal with hand cramping and relieve tension in the thumb. In her discussion about visualizing the fingerboard and scales, it would have been helpful if Raines had used chalk to show some imaginary frets on the instrument.

Originally from West Virginia, Missy began playing guitar at age ten but switched to bass at age 12. She has a great deal of experience as a professional musician, and her instruction is straight forward and easy to understand. Thirty-two minutes are not much time to teach playing techniques for the instrument, so she merely scratches the surface with some very ""bass-ics."" A useful tool for the beginner, this video or DVD closes with some humorous bloopers that occurred during the filming. (Joe Ross)",1314316800,,1371,4.960869565217391
