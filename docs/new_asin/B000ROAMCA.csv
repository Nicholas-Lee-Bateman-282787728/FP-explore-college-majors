8201847,5,B000ROAMCA,"To talk about Godard is to talk of one of the old oaks of the French New Wave. Breathless was his first and possibly his most irreverent film of the year, when Godard pays homage to the Noit genre, but blended with a caustic irony from start to finish. Les carabiners os a breathtaking movie about the war.

But Notre musique shows a Godard with new visions; his always inquisitive style describes three chapters; the war and its demons, and the master displays the war around the great War films, blended with notable sobriety in doculemtal style. The second chapter is by far, the mpst interesting, Godard acts and invites us to think about a set of vignettes about the process of creation as well as the future of cinema. Sibelius 'Fifth Symphony and Tchaikovsky's Patetique fit so well in the modle of the urban jungle with that well known touch of class, si typical of his style of the eighties.

I really like to invite you to get close around the unique and original style of this efervescent creator.",1211414400,6,1008,4.594444444444444
