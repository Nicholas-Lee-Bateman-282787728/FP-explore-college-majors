8621418,5,B00G9BBY9K,"This modest, powerful film tells how the art program at Ohio's Bittersweet Farms-- the country's oldest farmstead community for adults with autism-- has tapped hidden talents in the residents, and given them a voice through art.  People unable to explain themselves have been liberated.  Art has offered a window into their psyches, allowing staff to understand what's troubling the people they serve, and to see, for the first time, who they essentially are.

In the documentary style perfected by Ken Burns, the story is told with the help of interviews with Bittersweet staff.  Apt quotations about the value of art from such luminaries as John Updike and Freida Kahlo frame each individual story within the larger tale.  Focusing on five longtime residents-- ""The Historian,"" ""The Illustrator,"" and so on-- this professionally made film, produced and directed by Cora and Richard Walsh, the mother and brother of one of the subjects, is beautiful and deeply moving.  And it seems utterly fresh.

In the Bittersweet art studios we meet Joe, ""The Historian,"" who draws his life from memory, always through the perspective through which he first saw something-- a bus, for instance, viewed from a window above.  Through art Joe ultimately revealed a childhood trauma: his near-drowning at Lake Erie.  (Joe's painting of the accident is childlike, haunting, and devastating.)  Bronwen, ""The Storyteller,"" expressed her grief about the death of her father through a series of landscapes that at first seemed innocent.  Canvas after canvas showed green grass and blue sky. Then one day a brown swathe punctured the serene landscape, plunging deeply below the grass.  Above the earth, in primitive handwriting, were the words ""Daddy Dirts.""

Again and again, the art studio becomes a sanctuary, a therapist's chair.  We learn that Conor, ""The Illustrator,"" and the filmmakers' family member, worked through a period of anxiety when his mother was in Ireland.  Staff understood the change in his behavior when he began drawing a series of terrified-looking portraits of his mother.  Steve, ""The Recluse,"" found safety in a corner of the art room after a cancer battle.  And Patra, ""The Realist,"" created a whimsical series of critters that have become the basis for some ceramic designs made and sold at the farm.  As Patra's talent emerged, her longtime temper tantrums subsided.  She gave her critters a home and named it Twitter Forest, a place, like Bittersweet, where beings live protected from the dangers of the outside world.

Though the film dwells on how adults with autism have expressed their suffering through art, it also shows the inner joys that have been released in the art studios-- through drawing, painting, ceramics, and weaving.  Much of the work produced at Bittersweet is gallery-worthy and stunning.

This is an important film.  The shame is that it has not been shown in wide release--or on PBS.  At a time when adults with autism are entering the adult world-- and a society unprepared to serve their needs-- in greater numbers each year, art is something that works.  It is meaningful.  It can even help autistic adults earn money through the sale of their work.  And you don't necessarily need a farm-based program, big grant funding, or professional artists to achieve the miracle being played out on this Ohio farm.  But you do need to listen to what ""A Thousand Words"" is telling you--whether you have an autistic family member or not.

8621419,5,B00G9BBY9K,"So inspiring!  Not only, the use of art as a communication outlet but the fact that caregivers GET IT!!  If you are connected in any way to a caregiver who works with individuals with ASD this is a super awesome gift.  Caregivers' talents often get overlooked because this occupation is often under-rated and ignored as ""something anyone could do.""",1383782400,,348,4.864406779661017
8621420,5,B00G9BBY9K,"Even for someone like myself, who is the parent of an adult with autism, and who is president of an association dealing with the adult autism issue, this film was a revelation.  It cogently and beautifully demonstrates the various ways in which art is not only important, but truly essential, to many people with autism.  Above all, art provides a means of expression and communication for people who have limited or even no ability to express themselves in words, and who often suffer high levels of frustration when we ""normals"" can't grasp what they're experiencing.  But there's more.  Watch this film, and learn for yourself.  It will be SO worth it!",1383782400,,655,4.864864864864865
8621421,5,B00G9BBY9K,"It was a pleasure to be a part of this project, and to watch it come to fruition. The vision and devotion of the producer and director were force that brought this film to life. It is a joy and a privilege to work with these wonderful artists every day. This film is a testament to all of the benefits that art has to offer to individuals with autism.",1383696000,,351,4.101449275362318
8621422,5,B00G9BBY9K,"I have a friend autistic; he has opened a different world to me, a world on one hand painful yet on another funny and maybe a bit wild. You will see in this documentary how art has helped greatly in the lives of the residents at Bitter Sweet, but also how people with Autism have changed the viewer - you, you cannot view this and not be impressed with the content, the compassion, art, and artists
This is a must for all, especially the friends and family of those with autism, there is a lot of help available, you are not on your own, reach out.
How do we get this to the decision makers when funds are being allocated?

Last note to the Director, many thanks and brilliant job, well done",1383696000,,691,4.234848484848484
