8677109,3,B00NB23F6U,"This DVD should be used together with the latest edition of the book which would rate a 5 star rating.  The latest edition book is an excellent collaboration between Master Liang and Dr. Yang.  The DVD is good, with three stars for the following reasons.  First, there is a lot of wasted time on discussion, oral secrets, and the introduction to the DVD which is an unnecessary repeat of material clearly presented in the book.  The DVD is probably used by most Baguazhang Practitioners to review material as well as learn the forms in detail that may have been presented in class.  This is difficult to do with the unnecessary oral discussions, such as oral secrets.  At times the techniques (ex. 8 palms ) could be broken more in addition to performing them 2 or three times at a slower speed.  Yes, as presented it would be OK for students with a good amount of Baguazhang experience and the opportunity to attend at least two classes each week on a regular basis.  Yes, we are very impressed by the woman in the purple uniform who does the 8 palms beautifully but in these DVD's it should be remembered that they should be mostly instructional and not more of a demonstration.  Eliminating oral discussions etc. would allow more time for actual physical instruction.  Master Liang's presentation throughout is outstanding but in some places such as applications more time should be spent in instruction.  Some parts of the DVD would certainly be a 4 star, however the 3 star rating is to hopefully encourage future editions to have more instructional material, i.e. broken down techniques and at times more slowly as well as eliminating unnecessary discussions found in the book.  Though this DVD and the XingyiQuan DVD are presented as an YMAA DVD publication (many of which are very good),  I was surprised that the intro was so overdone with YMAA information.  As I understand it, Master Liang is the Baguazhang and Xingyiquan master and as far as I know his school is independent from YMAA schools and on these DVD's Dr. Yang is assisting, yet he is 1st author on the Xingyiquan DVD?? (an error?).  Dr. Yang's expertise is in Tai Chi, White Crane, Northern Shaolin and is certainly a master in these arts.  Most of us purchased this DVD for Master Liang's expertise.",1447804800,4,2274,4.748091603053435
