I have been waiting for this DVD Release FOREVER and even wrote to HBO begging them to release it on DVD.  This is Damon Wayans at his best.  Whatever it costs, just buy it.

8124039,2,B000FKO3TO,"""Still Standing""..that's the one you want. Although ""Last Stand"" has it's moments, my friends & I found ourselves laughing about 1/3 of the time..where as his later special ""Still Standing"" is just about hilarious all the way through. Don't buy this, rent it...buy ""Still Standing"" instead. You won't be disappointed.",1252368000,2,317,5.36
