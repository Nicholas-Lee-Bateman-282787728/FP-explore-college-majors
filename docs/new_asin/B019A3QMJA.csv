7565948,4,B019A3QMJA,"Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its - her actually - chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?

7565949,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar does it again! They deliver a wonderful movie in every way for audiences of all ages! I had the pleasure of taking my oldest daughter to see this (her first time seeing a movie in the theater), and seeing her facial expressions was priceless. This adorable story is one of the funniest Pixar films I've seen, about an old man who just lost his adventurous wife (in what, I may add, is one of the saddest Pixar montage scenes ever made). In order to fulfill his promise to her, and avoid submission to an ""old folks home,"" Carl Fredricksen uses about a thousand or so balloons and takes off for South America where he will retire to live out the rest of his days at Paradise Falls -- the place his wife so desperately wanted to go before her death. Along the way, though, he is joined by Cub Scout Russell, the very depiction of youth that Carl both envies and at times despises. Along the way they befriend a rare bird, come across ""talking"" dogs and run into their nemesis --  Carl's childhood hero, Charles Muntz -- who's been trying to kidnap the bird and hence thwart their mission.

As usual, Pixar throws in so many slight ""Easter Eggs"" story lines that it would take more than just one viewing to pick up on all of them. One example of an ""Easter egg"" storyline plot is the fact that when Carl and Russell first meet, Russell, reading from his Cub Scout guide, asks Carl if he can help him cross the street, cross his lawn, cross anything -- anything so he can get his final badge of helping an senior citizen. Of course, most viewers will/should pick up that Russell helps Carl do another sort of ""crossing"" by near movie's end. It's a theme that's central to Carl's character and storyline: crossing his heart. Keeping that promise that's so important to those closest to us in life. And what results is one of the sweetest, most touching endings to a Pixar movie. Of course, this comes from a guy who teared up when first watching the ending of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsters-Inc-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JKDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, when Sully pops that final splinter into the door, steps through and hears Boo's voice, ""Kitty!"" Oh. <sniff> Oh, man. <sniff, sniff>

Now that I'm a father, those emotions and little cute moments in most of Pixar's movies appeals to me, and touches me, much more than it did before parenthood (although it was still good back then too). ""Up"" is one of my favorite movies of the year so far; I'll continue to entrust Pixar with the quality they produce.",1249776000,,2622,4.848214285714286
7565950,1,B019A3QMJA,"This review is not for the movie itself but for the price of this Blu-ray. Over 41 dollars!? Are they insane? No movie should cost more than $20; and with so many DVD's these days being bargain priced at $10, this film is way overpriced. As if the company is ashamed to ask for so much $$$, they've even included a label that reads ""a $74 dollar value""? Really? How is that possible when all I want is the movie? I could care less for the 3D glasses or the extra special features or the on-line bonus material or the digicopy disc. Does anybody really care about all that stuff? Doesn't 90% of the population just want the movie and maybe a decent documentary to go with it? Does Pixar really think so little of its fans that it thinks it can pull the wool over our heads like this?

I had planned on completing my Pixar collection on Blu-Ray since the transfers look fantastic but now I have to reconsider. We are currently in a recession and I don't have the extra money for this. Of course, this begs the question, why? Why does Pixar have to charge so much extra for their movies? Surely, a popular title like Up will be mass produced to sell a bazillion copies, therefore allowing for more economic pricing. Could it be that the greed that sank the Disney Corp. after ""The Lion King"" topped the box office has now affected Pixar? Has Pixar succumb to its own success? I prayed the day wouldn't come. I was a HUGE Disney fan, to the point of near religious devotion, before the company sold their heart and soul (Cinderella 2, anyone?) for a cheap buck. Please, John Lasseter, give us reasonable pricing and try to remember what made your company special in the first place---caring more about the art and less about the money. Does money have to corrupt everything? Don't make the same mistake as Disney.",1249603200,22,1809,4.448795180722891
7565951,5,B019A3QMJA,"To say the least, ""Up"" is a fantastic movie that has something to say for all ages, even for adults. I believe Up sets itself apart from all the other movies in the Disney/Pixar catalog.

So far all of Disney/Pixar Blu-rays have had stunning picture quality. I am expecting the same for ""Up"" and hope that it's filled with plenty of extras, commentator(s) tracks, and possibly shorts as well.

Still though, the movie alone is definitely worth a buy!",1246060800,,450,4.6835443037974684
7565952,5,B019A3QMJA,"Well after taking my nephew to see land Of The Lost ,we walked out of it and the manager asked us if we would like to see Up Instead and we did. Let me tell you going from a piece of smut like land Of The Lost to a wonderful film like this is just the ultimate rescue. What can you say from the opeing short film which makes you feel so good with the stork delivering the babies,to the feature film which show the goodness that is inherent in everyone. If people think Ed Asner legacy is The mary Tyler moore show they are wrong his legacy is right here as the voice of the main character in Up. I cant egin to tell you how good I felt to see no Cursing or other foul mouth words in this film unlike land Of The Lost. I have already preordered the film on blu ray,and I hope disney will put the short film with the reales also.

7565953,5,B019A3QMJA,"Warm, wonderful, beautiful, allegorical, moving and heartfelt. Pixar do not seem to do run of the mill. Thank God they are not the child of their parent company!

Up is fantastical tale of Carl Fredericksen, an old man with nothing left to lose letting go and following his childhood dream. Hitching a ride on Carls flying home is Russell, a young widerness explorer scout and together the mis-matched pair set off in the footsteps of Carls childhood hero, daredevil explorer Charles Muntz (wonderfully voiced by Christopher Plummer), to Paradise Falls in darkest South America.

As with Wall-E, Up does not start like a kids movie, adults of an emotive disposition will be in tears within the first 10 minutes and most of the first quarter is scene setting, done, like Wall-E again, with a minimal amount of dialogue. Revealtions, when they come, will also mean more to an adult audience; the very real perception that we are all too busy chasing the dream to realise the dream is what we already have in everyone and everything around us; the moral that one should never meet ones heroes because even heroes are fallable. And, of course, for the kids, the triumph of good and friendship over evil.

However, Up is a genuine family film. Pixar have really mastered the balance of enjoyment for all ages and the reward for the little ones to sit patiently through that first quarter is plenty of cute and comical once our heroes land in the jungle. Dug the clueless golden retriever and his pack, Squirrel! and Fred the bird are a joy. Not manic, or over the top, or Disney stupid but well rounded fall guys that you warm to immediately. Subsequent adventures may see septuagenarian Carl turn into some kind of Indiana Jones (the only incongruous note to the film considering his previous incapacitation) but Up is still head and shoulders above anything else produced outside of the Pixar stable. It is beautifully well observed and loaded with deft touches; the animation is, yet again, impeccable.

So there are plenty of morals to be taught and lessons to be learnt and good will out etc. etc. But there's talking dogs (dozens more than Bolt (and a dozen times funnier!)), a flying house, a chocolate addicted bird and a crazy scientist explorer. The dark bits are not excessively so and many of the funny bits are laugh-out-loud funny. If it is perhaps, too plodding for younger audiences then that is to Pixars credit for not dumbing down and chasing the pandering parent pound. Up is another addition to their impressive catalogue of genuine family classics.

Another great film, a film that's for life, not just the holiday season.",1244160000,,2639,4.816777041942605

7565999,3,B019A3QMJA,"Like a lot of movies in the last 25+ post Star Wars era from way back in 1977, this film is formulated to be an event, and has a quasi psychiatric and psychological manipulation formula with a Disney flourish at the end.

I mean the long of the short of it is that you should go on your adventures when you can, but the movie says ""no, you need to settle down regardless"".  And further, that hunting, for the film makers, comes in one flavor; hunting for sport, which shouldn't be done, but there are people who hunt to put meat on the table because that's how they live.  But this is an issue that's never addressed in the film, and could have been a watershed moment if the screenwriters were half as bright as they claim to be by the production values of this film.  Because otherwise the movie is pretty thin in its sociological message to today's children in terms of how we value animals.

The other big sociological message is that values have changed since the 1920s when hunting big game on safari was the wealthy elite pass time to partake in.  The classic socialite hero from the society column and theatre News' Reels is paraded for all his worth.  As well as his target of ambition, a befabled ""gooney bird"" of sorts.  I suppose that's a positive, but it's fairly one dimensional as per my previous paragraph.

I guess the thing that gets me about this film is that it's incomplete as per my first paragraph.  I don't like hunting, nor do I appreciate people who use terms like ""harvest animals"" as a supposed defanging of the term ""hunting"" to make it socially acceptable to slaughter wild animals, especially when you can well afford meat at the butcher's counter at your local supermarket.  But, there are people, a very slim minority (my assigned father thanks to the United States Army and maybe even the CIA) who hunt to help feed either themselves of their friends.  Again, we're shown the wealthy trophy hunter from days long gone, and not much else.

This movie also says to me that to settle down is better than to live out your dreams as you desire.  That's one of the poorest messages I've ever seen conveyed in a children's film, because the message goes on further to state that you can always live out your dreams later on.  Eh, well, no. especially if this movie is any example.  Oh sure, the story mechanics allow for wish fulfillment, but I think a better message would have been for the main character and his wife to go on their adventure and go through the same plot, only together without the emotional weight.  It would have been much in the same vein as ""The Incredibles"".

Instead we're given a pretty sour film that tries to allow an elderly man a second chance at adventure, when he should have had it all along with or without the woman he loved.  That's why I'm giving this movie so many stars instead of what it really deserves; one, maybe two, probably zero.

But, PIXAR-Disney production values offset the poor screenplay, but only just.  Some of the characters, notably Doug the dog, are likeable for who they are, and I'm sorry the antagonist or villain got the classic Hollywood ""evil at the core"" treatment instead of a more intellectual Miyazaki approach, and thereby wasn't allowed to evolve as perhaps he should have.

A pretty bland movie that lacks a lot of wisdom in the writing department.  Some wit, some sight gags, a little bit of intelligence, this is otherwise a pretty poor story.  See it once to enjoy it as a visual experience, but even then there's not much flash to it.

I'm sorry I rented it, but I'm glad I saw it at least one time.",1529971200,,3600,4.510015408320493

7566179,2,B019A3QMJA,"I recall this being a great movie, but my review is specifically for anyone who purchases this DVD and intends to play it on their computer. Disney uses a protection scheme that prevents the DVD from loading on a computer or, if it loads, prevents playback without freezing and skipping every few seconds. It is super frustrating to drop $20 on a 9-year old movie and not be able to play it without buying a TV and DVD player. If you watch your movies on a computer at home, I do not recommend buying the DVD version.",1514764800,,517,4.34020618556701

I liked that one of the protagonists is a senior and  one of the enduring narrative threads is how much he loved and missed his wife. The animal characters provide lots of humor and really add to the story. The 2 short on the disc are funny and I recommend that the viewer take the time to watch them. This is a PG rate film and it does have some moments that a child might find scary when a kid is in jeopardy and the villain meets his just reward.

  With this movie, Pixar offers up a RESOUNDING rebuttal to all of those close-minded, misguided souls who insist that ""cartoons"" are ONLY for children. Case in point: the montage very early in the film that shows many of the major events in Carl's life is some the most emotionally moving film-making  in ANY medium (using either ""real"" people or animated characters)  that you will EVER see! And, that doesn't even include the action, adventure and humor that follows! Though it is ONLY a ""cartoon"", this movie is an amazingly touching, and sweet, rumination on the joys and sadness of relationships  and, by extension, life. So, the lesson here is: just because the kids like it, does NOT mean that it has nothing to offer us poor, jaded adults. Buy it today, and watch it with your kids  heck, buy it today, and watch it EVEN if you don't have any kids. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

VIDEO: 1.78:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (29.7 Mbps)

  This movie's image, while featuring vivid well-saturated colors, and sharply rendered, finely-detailed objects, has  in quite a few scenes  some slight banding on large areas of the same (or nearly the same) color. Aside from that, it also has very good, to frequently excellent, contrast; and, it has very good shadow detail (as seen in the many dark and shadowy areas, such as the night scenes, and the dark scenes located in Carl's house). Also, fine detail is frequently evident in the brighter scenes (such as those in the jungle settings), and in the many close-ups of the ""rare"" bird and of Charles Muntz's dogs. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations (obviously, because this is a CGI-based, animated movie). Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has very good picture quality; and, it should satisfy the vast majority of viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  The sound quality of the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack for this disc, was pretty good (not great, but still pretty good)  while, it is NOT amongst the very best examples of the art, it is still better than many of the audio presentations out there. The film's dialog is clear and well placed, and the rear and side channels (I used the Dolby PLIIx mode on my processor while listening) are sometimes active and fairly directional; with clear, well recorded, sound cues and (on, all too rare, occasion) a decent amount of bass. Overall, the audio for this movie is a pleasing affair, that should satisfy all but the pickiest of listeners.

7566469,5,B019A3QMJA,"I think by now most people have seen Up, but if there is one thing to know about this movie is that it's one of those Pixar classics that you can watch over and over again. Is this review a tad clich? Perhaps. But when you're shoving Friday night pizza into your mouth, trying to silence the sobs threatening to escape, and using the same grease-stained napkin you used a second ago to wipe the BBQ sauce off your fingers for the tears that are quickly dripping onto your sweatpants, then you know this movie is legit. Nothing like the first 10 minutes of this movie to remind you of the #couplegoals you and those instagram people you follow dream about. 5/5, always.",1482192000,11,668,4.439024390243903

7566480,3,B019A3QMJA,"I stop shy at 3 stars because (spoiler alert) the villian is killed. Granted, the villian in this case was cruel to the child and tried to kill him first. (which I thought went too far in an otherwise great story). Disney also killed off the villian in Beauty in the Beast, (this disturbed my 11 year old daughter) and pretty much every other movie they make. I see a trend here!  What's wrong with this? Think about it. There is no chance at redemption for the villian. The bad person dies a bad death - unrepentant. It's brutal, it's final - and it's a bit vengeful or vigilante. There's really no good lesson that can be taught from it. In life good people die too. Everyone dies. But in Disneyland, the bad die and the good live happily ever after. Period.

This movie is perfect for that! I wish I had the time to show the whole movie to show that by helping Russel, Carl is able to find integrity and Russel is able to find Industry.
It's an adorable movie for big kids too! After teaching this for many years now I can finally get through the opening scenes without tearing up. And even when I do, it's a great discussion for my students about how my life stage of having a family is different from their life stage of finding their identity. :)",1479427200,,664,4.362903225806452

7566630,5,B019A3QMJA,"Well crafted Disney-Pixar animation hits all the marks:
- Technical quality.  Great colorful animation with amazing computer generated lighting effects.  An apartment room is set ablaze with all the various color of the thousands of balloons that pass by the window as the house lifts off the ground.  Wonderful landscape animation of the Paradise Falls location.

- Charming storyline.  Without spoiling it, it is a heart-warming story of a couple sharing a love for adventure, growing old, and never having had a chance to fulfill their dream adventure trip together.  The man decides to go it alone (but has a stowaway attention-craving child who has lost the affections of his father).  Together they discover that all of life is an adventure (not just the far and exotic), and they learn to value the ""boring things"" and each other.

We watched with our 7 year old, and there are deeper emotional elements that they seem to get.  There are humorous scenes as well.  Family friendly and a memorable movie.",1472342400,5,1009,4.9523809523809526

Yet ""Up"" also respects its audience rather than being too obvious, which is especially rare in animated films. Wonderfully impossible, the plot is alternately gentle and thrilling, a great vacation from the usual limitations of gravity. Front and center are some unforgettable and unique characters, rounded out with an unusually complex villain and his comically fierce dogs. There is a depth here that makes it worthwhile for old, medium and young to watch. My family kept talking about it afterward, and we will watch it again soon!",1471046400,,666,5.0636363636363635

7566761,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar has gotten it right yet again with UP. The initial previews for this movie had me skeptical as to whether it could live up to it's other Pixar counterparts, but I couldn't have been further from wrong! UP is a movie that I can sit and watch with my husband after a day at work and connect to on an emotional level, and at the same time is a movie that I can watch with my sons knowing that it will fill them with joy and laughter.
The beauty of Pixar (and specifically this movie) is that they are able to take a movie, make it appealing to younger viewers, while at the same time adding deepness that only adults can really grasp, emotionally investing members of the family of all ages in its story.
As far as this movies specific packaging goes, the 5 disc combo is awesome. The packaging is simple, sturdy, and looks very nice. There are literally 3 discs that have some form of Bonus features on them, which makes for hours upon hours of UP outside of the movie itself. If you want everything UP, than this combo pack is definitely the one to buy.",1466208000,,1058,4.268656716417911

7566997,4,B019A3QMJA,"This is a charming little film which has a bit more going for it than humanized cars or planes. Mr Frederickson is elderly and recently bereaved. His house is under threat from developers and he is being hassled by a boy scout of sorts. Prompted by a discovered note from his wife urging him to be adventourous, he turns his house into a flying home and sets sail for South America. Though starting alone, he accumulates passengers. Firstly, Russell, whos ardently seeking a badge for helping the elderly, then others. Theres a hic-cup or two and a surprise villain, whos quite deranged. Theres also a huge pack of dogs, who through highly technologically advanced collars, are able to articulate their thoughts. Conflict and daring-do follow and adventures are had in spades!

Please note that while intended for children, smaller ones might find the death of Mrs Frederickson and the latter swashbuckling (violence) a bit much. My five yo old had mixed feelings, though he enjoyed the end, so all was well. I thought it was a lovely idea about continuing to seek your dreams and not letting age and the associated events get you down. My personal favourite, was the well conceived and exececuted idea of the talking dogs. Despite their best efforts they were still dogs and the portrayal of their expressions and foibles was wonderful. A good family film, with something for everyone.",1456617600,,1386,4.897872340425532

7567099,5,B019A3QMJA,"I was very happy to learn that Disney had decided to re-release
UP for Blu-ray as a 3D presentation.  I have always had a soft
spot for this wonderfully charming, touching adventure story that
proves once again that nobody makes animated features quite
like Pixar.

In one of the most poignant animated sequences ever filmed, we learn
the story of a young boy named Carl (Ed Asner) who dreams of
embarking on great adventures.  This young boy stumbles upon the
love of his life, Ellie (Elizabeth Docter), who becomes his fellow ""adventurer.""
The two marry and grow old together, putting money away in hopes of
being able to visit Paradise Falls, a place that Carl swore he would one
day bring Ellie to visit.  Unfortunately, that dream is never realized, as
Ellie eventually passes away.  Now, a grumpy old man, Carl finds that
he is about to lose his home to a commercial construction company.
In a last-ditch effort to fulfill his promise to Ellie, Carl uses balloons to lift
his home and journey to South America.

UP excels in both story and animation.  This beautifully crisp HD transfer
brings out all the wonderful textures within the artistry accented with
exuberant and stirring colors.  None of the deep, well saturated coloration
seems to be hindered by active shutter eyewear.  Black levels are
exceptional.  Chalk this up as another outstanding, flawless rendering.

I wasn't quite certain if UP was originally conceived for or later up-converted
to 3D.  Something seemed rather odd to me when watching the Blu-ray --
it looked too damn good to be a simple up-conversion, particularly for the
fact that there was quite a bit of protrusion.  Upon doing some research, I
was delighted to find that UP was actually Pixar's very first film to be presented
in the newly introduced 3D format.

There is a predominant amount of depth to be found here which gives a keen
sense of giving proper size to foreground and background objects.  In the
beginning of the film, there is a clever shot of Carl sliding down his electric
stairlift.  Take a look at the contrast between the wall and the front railing.
It really provides a realistic sense of spacing.  Many of the best 3D moments
of the film involve Carl's home flying over a city street or just gliding amongst
the clouds. Those shots provide exceptional view master-like moments that
greatly illustrate size amidst various objects.

As I recently mentioned, the one aspect of watching UP that convinced me
that this wasn't a simple up-conversion was the amount of objects that protruded
from the screen.  As we watch Ellie lying on her back next to Carl describing cloud
formations, her fingers seem to extend beyond the borders of the screen.  There
are many similar moments where Carl's thick black-rimmed glasses, nose and
chin poke outward.  Even the snouts of dogs find themselves popping forward.
Now mind you, I wouldn't consider these real ""In Yo' Face"" moments, but the
jettisons are so tastefully done, that one can't help but still be admired by it all.

Disney's 5.1 DTS-HD MA is a real pleasure to listen to, particularly for Michael
Giachinno's wonderfully soothing score with touches of waltzes and anthems
which immerses and seemingly lifts the viewer as if attached to a string of
balloons. I rarely hear a score for an animated film that perfectly captures
the adventure on-screen than this one. Of course, the rear channels do an
exceptional job of relaying all the surrounding scenic and weather elements.
There is a good amount of rumbling LFE response to be found here whether
it be during a thunderstorm or when Carl's home is flying too close to the ground.
Clean, clear and crisp are three words that come to mind when describing how
well the sound is translated to the viewer.  A exceptional HD experience in both
picture and sound.

UP arrives as a 4-disc combo pack that includes 3D/2D Blu-ray+2D Blu-ray
Bonus Features+DVD+Digital Copy. It even looks as if all the extra features
of the original Blu-ray release have been ported over.  There were no trailers
included on the 3D disc.

The Blu-ray case is sleeved in lenticular packaging.

UP is yet another masterpiece from the Pixar animation team. In 2009 it was
awarded two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Score.  If
you have not had the opportunity to see this film in 3D, it is definitely time to
take a second look.  UP looks even more uplifting than ever before thanks to
a 3D presentation that is nothing less than perfect.",1453075200,,4488,4.822454308093994

This is one of the most enjoyable movies you could ever watch.  It has so much heart and soul, it just reaches out and grabs your inner kid.  This is right up there with the Incredibles, Brave, and Toy Story 3, if not better.

The plot, in addition to being outrageously implausible, seemed muddled and forced into a ridiculous conflict with a horrible resolution. I think the problem was, in a large part, the pudgy kid who shows up and ruins the old fellow's plot to fly the house to an isolated location and slowly die. The kid was an irritating, obnoxious distraction and brought to an instant end what could have been a very fascinating final flight of the old balloon man. The subsequent sequences with talking dogs and the far too convenient encounter with the remote old adventurer was just too much to follow without shutting off your brain.

The animation was fair yet lazy. Old man's head was like a giant square and the kid was basically an animated circle blob, not too dissimilar from the blob from Mosters vs. Aliens. The music was notable - albeit frequently melancholy and depressing, much like the experience of sitting through this film.",1448582400,,1001,4.819767441860465

So, instead of smiling and pretending I knew what they were talking about, I decided to actually watch the movie.  I don't have young children anymore, so watching animated movies has fallen by the wayside. Well, I ended up crying--dripping tears and snot all over their essays---I'm just kidding about the tears and slimy stuff but not the crying. It is a tear jerker in the beginning. I genuinely enjoyed the film because it teaches so much about human interaction and friendship. It is really such a good movie for adults and children, and now I get ""Squirrel"".""",1438646400,,678,4.697478991596639

7567481,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up is a computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by Pete Docter. The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen,voiced by Edward Asner; and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell,voiced by Jordan Nagai. By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year-old Carl sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America and to complete a promise made to his lifelong love. It was co-directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.

Carl Fredricksen is a 78-year-old balloon salesman. His entire life, Carl has longed to wander the wilds of South America. Then, one day, the irascible senior citizen shocks his neighbors by tying thousands of balloons to his home and finally taking flight. But Carl isn't alone on his once-in-a-lifetime journey, because stowed away on his front porch is an excitable eight-year-old wilderness explorer named Russell. Later, as the house touches down on the world's second largest continent, Carl and his unlikely traveling companion step outside to discover that not only is their new front lawn considerably larger, but that the predators therein are much more ferocious than anything they ever faced back home.

Funny and poignant and full of life, Up easily qualifies as one of the best computer-animated movies ever released. The pacing is perfect, the animation looks terrific, the emotional range is wide, and there are a few sly jokes you might not catch the first time around. That's okay; you'll want to see it a second time anyway. It was obviously another masterful work of art from Pixar, it is an exciting, hilarious, and heartfelt adventure impeccably crafted and told with wit and depth.",1433721600,,1748,5.173144876325089

 Both thumbs go up for Up.  This is another home run for Pixar, the latest in a lengthening string of major box office hits.  Ed Asner, a very nice old dude, supplies the voice to the cranky old dude who is the main character in this animated family film.
 For the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie we are introduced to the life of the 78 year old protagonist.  We follow him from his first meeting with Ellie at age six or seven through their courtship, marriage and her eventual passing on after many years of happy companionship.  The two people are clearly enthralled with on another and adore each other.  It is a very touching part of the movie.
 The now widowed old man encounters an eight year old scout who needs only his helping the elderly badge to complete his requirements for promotion.  An unlikely adventure ensues.
 I was able to see this fabulous family film with my own baby boy, now 21.  We both enjoyed it a lot, although he didn't cry twice like I did.  The movie is popular with the tots to middle school demographic.  Surprisingly, it is also just as popular with adults both younger and older than the 25 year old movie graphic mark.  Young, old and in-between this is a film well worth seeing.
 Up pulled in an invigorating $68 million in the first three days.  This film will surely gross well over a half billion dollars world wide, as several of the other recent Pixar offerings have done.  This is a banner year for the movies.  Of the top 10 movies, Night at the Museum, Star Trek and Angels and Demons are all over the magic $100 mark. Up and Terminator soon will be.

7567708,5,B019A3QMJA,"Since catching the Frozen bug, I've been looking for another animated feature that is as compelling. For my money, most honestly aren't but this one is. Jaded as I am, I get through most dramas without crying and most comedies without laughing out loud - this film made me do both.

The storyline is quite unorthodox. It starts with the happily ever after! The montage depicting Carl and Ellie's happy married years is absolutely astounding. Ironically, given the film's title, it's very down to earth. It's some of the most masterful and touching motion picture work I've ever witnessed - animated or live action.

The adventure segment kicks in at the absolute least likely of junctures: the morning a cantankerous old Carl is scheduled to get trucked off to assisted living. The premise - rigging his house with thousands of balloons to turn it into an airship - is comically absurd. Perfect for an animated fantasy.

I'm not much for dogs in real life but here they really cracked me up. (Especially all the ""Dogs Playing Poker"" references...) The golden retriever Dug is easily the most funny and least annoying of all comic relief sidekicks.

Overall, this is one of the most brilliant and original things I've ever seen.",1424476800,13,1227,4.856459330143541

7567747,5,B019A3QMJA,"I felt that this movie is sort of the capstone of Pixar's great trilogy which started with Ratatouille and WALL-E.  These three movies stand independently and deal with topics that are of interest to all ages.  This movie is full of great optimism, adventure, and fun characters.  I especially liked the homages to the old era of exploration, with the old man growing up listening to tales on the radio of South American explorers.  This movie is also pretty funny.  The appeal to all ages is clear in the rating too--this movie, almost silently, was rated PG, I believe primarily due to a spot of blood and some hard family problems.  Like most Pixar movies, it falls apart a little at the end with a contrived action sequence, but this movie kept even that to a minimum, which I greatly appreciated.",1422230400,,801,4.6453900709219855

many scenes that were far too violent or intense for our kids. The killer dogs (especially the doberman), the evil man trying to kill them, the house on fire, and many more scenes were not consistent with the theme of the movie we wanted to watch!! Some parts
were funny, but overall the sense of danger and violence really turned us off to this 'kids' movie. Don't know what the producers
were thinking in marketing this as a cute movie. It wasn't.",1421625600,,571,4.607843137254902

7567760,4,B019A3QMJA,"I'm not entirely certain any court can order an elderly person to move into a senior center.  It's a chilling thought if they could.  But that's the premise behind Pixar's film UP.  Which forces the main character Carl, a miserable curmudgeon if ever there was one, to attach balloons to his house and head for Paradise Falls South America.  Through no fault of his own, he ends up with a hitchhiker of sorts, Russell (a Wilderness Explorer desperate to earn a merit badge for assisting the elderly).  With Russell's help, they do make it to Carl's destination.  They also get more than they expected when they discover a BIG bird Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug, a pack of talking dogs, and a psychotic explorer named Muntz bent on killing them and capturing Kevin.  The plot isn't as happy-go-lucky as one would think.  The film opens joyfully with a wonderful montage of Ellie and Carl......they get old, she dies.  And then we have a clich shot of their tiny house dwarfed by skyscrapers (like that hasn't been done before).  Yes, some of the imagery was magical, some of the characters were fun, some of the action sequences were exciting................  But I had a difficult time getting past the unpleasant old geezer who took forever to become unbelievably kind.  I'll never understand the film industries' fascination for crabby old men.  Attitude is everything.  It's not that amusing watching someone scowl and grouse.  (I truly believe they killed off the wrong character.  Ellie would have brought joy and wonder to the expedition.  All Carl brought was excess baggage.)",1421280000,2,1598,4.902985074626866

7567880,5,B019A3QMJA,"This was a UPlifting movie with plenty of humor in it. Its a good family movie with no real negatives things in it that I can think of. It does have some happy and sad moments but it can leave you with an uplifting feeling at the end.

Spoilers:
One of the funniest moments was when Carl (the old man) asked Doug (the dog) what to do (because they were smart dogs with collars that let them speak) and even as a person watching the movie I expected the Dog to know what to do (as he usually did) but instead he was chewing on a tennis ball (which reminds us he is just a dog after all). This gave Carl the courage to decide what to do and used that weakness for tennis balls against the pack of dogs trying to get them.
One good lesson from the movie is when Carl leaves his belongings behind to go rescue his friends. Previously he had chosen his house over his friends, but eventually he had a second chance and chose his friends (and still got to keep his house).",1417305600,,966,4.111111111111111

7567917,5,B019A3QMJA,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already...probably not much. I'm not usually one for Disney movies or cartoons...I enjoy action and thrillers and superhero movies, and typically Pixar and Disney don't really satisfy my interests. Up is definitely the exception to this. I suppose one might consider it to be an action/thriller/superhero movie in it's own right. It's got everything a girl could ask for: giant birds, talking dogs, flying houses, lots of balloons and Ed Asner. The first 5 minutes are sweet, funny and sad, so be sure to have a box of tissues available. After that, it's edge of your seat action and adventure as Carl, our protagonist, sticks it to the man and takes his beloved house on an adventure to Paradise Falls, to honor his best friend and partner-in-crime, Ellie. Hilarity and misadventure ensues, and Carl realizes he doesn't need Paradise Falls to honor Ellie's memory. There's another way. This movie does not disappoint.",1415836800,,962,4.9813664596273295

Definitely rated G.
I had seen this previously and now that my kids are a little older we decided to watch again. They LOVED it!
It is a little sad at parts (main character is an old man that loses his wife and misses her deeply), but the humor makes up for it.
Starts off a little gloomy, but gets better, give it a chance.
Has a lot of positive life messages in it. John Lassiter was the executive producer of this film, so if you liked Toy Story, you will probably like this.
Hope this helps.",1415059200,,581,4.150442477876106

In Blue-Ray, it is divine, everything is sharp, well defined, sound is top notch, maybe too good. As for the story, it can be sum up in three words, circle of life. An aging man who lost his wife of so many years, is now on a journey of completing his wife life long dream, but in the process, it becomes his journey as well. Helping a small child, bird and dog, he recharged his life to start all over again.

It dips into 4 star territory for me up until the part where the house and movie takes flight again, briefly back up into 5 stars and then once the movie hits the 'twist', it seems to change into something entirely different.  One talking dog and a crazy bird were kind of fun.  The rest of the dogs seemed to come out of left field and were explained much too late for my liking.  This portion of the movie vacillated between 2 - 3 stars for me with a few peaks of 4 stars.  The animation was top notch, and the main characters were mostly fun, but the story just wasn't well set up and the middle portion dragged too much for my tastes in addition to shifting into something very different from what I anticipated.

He calls Kevin the ""Icka bird"". I have no clue why, but this has become the ""Icka bird movie"" in my house. This Blu-ray/DVD combo was cheaper than just the DVD at my local retail store, so it was a no-brainer to order. From an adult standpoint I still enjoy the movie as much as my son. It's a touching story with fun characters and downright hilarious writing in some places. I've enjoyed all of Pixar's movies, but this is one of their best.",1409097600,,595,4.0508474576271185

7568052,5,B019A3QMJA,"""UP"" is one of those rare movies that uplift (no pun intended) the spirit and present older people and children in a positive light. The messages of kindness, fortitude, courage, persistence, and respect for elders, as represented by Mr. Fredericksen and Russell, are ones that need to be shown more frequently in film. Issues of loneliness, death, and single parenthood are also touched upon in a moving way. It is one of my favorite movies, and the colors are so brilliant and lively. The child who voices Russell is particularly adept at capturing a child's natural inquisitiveness along with demonstrating a respect for others.",1408924800,,631,5.076923076923077
7568053,5,B019A3QMJA,"Amazing - a great story, beautifully told, and fun, with a totally sweet (tinged with bittersweet) ending. Kids younger than 6 or 7 won't quite pick up on the depth of feeling and loss expressed in the opening 3 or 4 minutes (which is fine, of course), but they'll still make it through that intro, because the subject of the opening is a lifelong romance starting in childhood, which inevitably ends. But instead of sugarcoating the pain or hiding it, these amazing storytellers actually address it head-on, and matter-of-factly, so it seems more natural than scary. And of course, all that is softened almost immediately by fun and adventure which has a more 'authentic' feel, thanks to the frank, honest intro. Great storytelling, with surprising villains and incredible vistas. Grownups will appreciate the multiple levels here -- watch for a quick moment when the world's worst 'dogs-playing-poker' art gets an animated homage. And speaking of dogs (literally), I won't ruin the joke, but, well, you'll never say, ""Speak, Fido"" in the same way again. Ed Asner completely kills it as the lead voice. Fantastic, funny, literally up-lifting.",1408924800,,1143,5.117647058823529

7568063,1,B019A3QMJA,"What a horrible, dark, movie!!!!! I cannot believe that this movie was produced by Disney/ Pixar. True it grossed over $750,000,000 worldwide. However, I, for the life of me, cannot understand what were people thinking?
Is this entertainment?
Forget about feel good!!!
I felt worse after this movie than after any dark comedy or drama
Yuch!!!
Am I the only one that found the story absolutely depressing with no redeeming qualities?
* spoiler alert*
In the first half of the movie Ellie dies. With No children. The second half was even more depressing.
Grumpy old man Carl (Ed Asner) finally gets to fulfill Ellie's dream of going  to Paradise Falls with Russel. Without giving too much away, this movie was not bittersweet, it was plain and simple bitter and sour.  The main characters, Carl and Russel just had misery.  Carl loses his home that he loved so much, and poor Russel did not have things houng his way as well. His father did not show up for his honor at the Boy Scout when he finally earned the ""assisting the elderly"" badge.

Depressing, and Dark. If that's your ticket to entertainment you will enjoy.",1408320000,3,1117,4.742268041237113

7568163,5,B019A3QMJA,"Disney Pixar's Up is a classic masterpiece for children and adults. It is about an elderly man named Carl Fredrickson who ventures out to South America in his house tied to a bouquet of balloons, to fulfill his deceased wife's childhood dream. It is truly a tear jerker and will make you cry, because you can relate to the movie's portrayal of the elderly and the everlasting friendships of the people we meet in life.",1403913600,,418,4.586666666666667

7568171,5,B019A3QMJA,"The title gave very little away and even sounded a bit underwhelming, but this is one unusual movie that must be seen despite its title. The picture is very charming, even sad and yet there was fun, humor and even danger. The story begins as a back story of a grumpy Elderly man known as Mr. Frederickson who has lived his entire life in his small house in the city, His backstory includes his childhood obsession with a place called Paradise Falls in South America and to follow in the footsteps of his childhood explorer hero Charles Muntz and shows his love for his late wife Ellie, who shared his dream while she lived. After an accidental assault on a city worker over his mailbox, he is then ordered into a retirement facility, but chooses to close out his life in one last grand adventure as he has tied thousands of balloons to his house and on the day he is to go into the home, launches his house into the sky and heads South. He discovers -to his dismay that he is not going alone. Russell, A young Wilderness explorer scout has been caught up in the launch and ends up going for the ride. Along the way he and Russell get to know each other a bit better and when they get to South America, Mr. Fredrickson finds both his patience and courage tested when they meet the Denizens of the Tepui on which they have landed. They meet Dug, a dog capable of talking, Kevin, a huge colorful bird and Fredrickson finally meets his childhood hero Charles Muntz -only to find he is half mad and obsessed with finding Kevin- to the point where he will kill anyone who gets in his way and tries to kill them in order to capture Kevin. It is up to Russell, Dug and Mr. Fredrickson to save Kevin-and themselves and somehow- get to Paradise Falls.

I'm no techie savvy guru but I feel mislead by the 'digital copy' claims of being a movie anywhere/ on the go.  It would be nice to know where to look to see if your tablet or phone is compatible(or an app that's needed) if using windows media player route to download. My guess is unless you have Apple Mac laptop & Ipad & Iphone your limited to only watch  'mobile' on your PC/ laptop.

7568224,4,B019A3QMJA,"This animated film from 2009 (a surprise to me that it's been around so long, by the way) is a combination love story, action film, and social commentary. Odd bedfellows but it works for me. The love story forms the backbone of the story: our protagonist's long-running relationship with a childhood sweetheart. Very cute and sweet. (OK, I'm a sentimentalist; Full Disclosure!) The action film involves, among other things, talking dogs (not as in cartoon characters but rather as made possible by the technology of the Evil Antagonist), whose hilariously doggie-centric interests inform, not to say derail, the action every so often. The social commentary has to do with how urban development, about to take the home of our hero by eminent domain, is neatly thwarted. I love the animation: while the figures are caricatured (the one thing I objected to was the overly chubby Boy Scout, but it's well done), the movements and facial expressions are very realistic. Yay Pixar!",1399766400,,975,5.062111801242236

7568226,5,B019A3QMJA,A wonderful fantasy with a lot of appeal for both adults and children.  Probably plays better for adults.  The behavior and antics of the dogs are worth the price of entry by themselves.,1399507200,,186,4.606060606060606

7568239,5,B019A3QMJA,"There are too many animated films out there that are cheap useless comedies, but this film is mature, profound, sad, endearing, and an excellent commentary on the joys and tragedies of getting old. It is perhaps one of the best animated films made, barring Spirited Away, The Wind Rises, and Castle in the Sky. Up offers the audience a moving portrait of a former child nerd who grows into a grumpy old loner. Pixar does this in a delightful way, showing his early life in quick cuts and then him alone and sad. Then the major action begins as he decides to go away and realize his childhood dream of finding this land in South America, but this annoying kid ends up on his porch, ruining his fantasy escape. However, he learns better and in the end appreciates the boy and becomes his unofficial adoptive grandfather. Everything in this film is wonderful, there is no fault in it that I find. It is just glorious throughout. Even those who hate animation will realize from Up that animation is a worthy art form.",1398470400,,1013,4.571428571428571

7568244,5,B019A3QMJA,My Kids 5 and 3 yrs were hooked onto the TV for the full length of the movie..They loved it..,1398211200,,93,3.7
7568245,5,B019A3QMJA,"In my mind, this ranks up there with the best Pixar flicks - and that's saying a LOT.

This is story telling at its best. A story that works at a kid's level while able to handle more serious topics only adults would key in on. Namely, how we can't really move on with our lives if we're weighed down by our past (in this case, Carl's home and all it's memories of Ellie).

All of this is wrapped in a hilarious movie with talking dogs (""Squirrel!!""), an overzealous boy scout, a bird named Kevin, and a crusty old codger.

There's a better love story in the first 10 minutes of ""Up"" than the entire Twilight Series had in FIVE whole movies... and they did it with no dialogue.",1398211200,,677,4.232558139534884

7568251,5,B019A3QMJA,"The most wonderful movie.  Involves an old man whose life with his beloved wife is traced from when they meet through their growing old together.  It turns out the old man is, surprisingly, a rebel; and when he performs his big rebellious act, he doesn't realize that his actions have also affected a little boy scout.  So the two of them are bound together, much to the old man's dismay, in a very heroic and wondrous journey.

I can't recommend this movie enough and give it 10 stars, especially for families. It is highly creative with a beautiful unfolding relationship between the boy scout and the old man, full of adventure and great problem solving.  There are some scenes with some threatening dogs, so watch it first to decide if those parts would give any of your little ones nightmares.",1397865600,2,798,4.671428571428572

It certainly didn't seem like a children's movie.  There were some very ""adult"" themes early on, like the trials of life, that would probably lose children's interest early on.

All of this movie is just wonderful and Ed Asner plays the role of a lifetime, even though it's just his voice...and an animated him.

That look of surprise, wonderment and joy is the embodiment of this film. The inexplicable depth of imagination and intellect that created a cartoon storyline that is as inspired as this one hasn't been matched since the early Disney days.
The brilliance imbedded in the character of Russell, although wiser than his years, is emotionally youthful, sincere and just hysterically funny. The entire movie from beginning to end is refreshing, intelligent, thought-provoking, imaginative, surprising and most of all unexpectedly delicious. Every member of the family can truly enjoy this film, and not just once, as you might very well find that it is a very good movie to watch when others fail to impress. One of those movies that you have in your treasure vault that gets taken out maybe twice a year or so to sadden, then gladden and finally delight in the most beloved way.",1386374400,,1041,4.853932584269663

All he has left in the world is the house he grew up in...and he and his beloved wife lived in.  When developers buy up his property, he leaves in the MOSt unexpected manner and the adventure begins, but NOT before a little boy named Russell becomes a stowaway!

He had told her that the love story in UP! portrayed more about love in 8 minutes than most 2-hour movies. She surprised him with some UP!-themed touches on their wedding day and this movie. They took on their honeymoon and watched on one rainy day. Perfect gift for newlyweds deeply in love.,1382918400,,382,4.394366197183099

7568514,5,B019A3QMJA,"I've never been much of a fan of animated kids' movies. So, when I watched ""Up"" I was a bit skeptical at the start. However, my attitude quickly changed. This is truly a movie for people of all ages. And it contains a number of important messages. First, take advantage of your relationships while you have them, for nothing on this earth is permanent, as Carl discovers when Ellie, his wife, dies and they have never fulfilled their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. Probably every one of us have wished that we could have done something with a spouse, a parent, a child, or even a close friend who we will never see again. Second, age is no barrier when it comes to establishing a close bond, as Carl finds out when he and Russell befriend each other. Russell is a boy scout in need of a father figure. And Carl, who by now is a crotchety old man and is initially resistant to Russell, finds in him the companion with whom he will finally journey to Paradise Falls, albeit in a rather unconventional way (as he, Russell, and his entire house are carried by hundreds of balloons to their destination). Finally, don't give up your dream. Some day it will be fulfilled, even if it is in a way you never suspect.

This has turned out to be one of my favorite films. I've seen it twice, and I hope to see it again. Adults will resonate with its deeper messages. Kids will love its humorous and more fantastical moments.",1382745600,,1416,4.425287356321839

7568516,5,B019A3QMJA,"I missed seeing Up in theaters unfortunately, but I did get to see it on dvd after it was released. I bawled many times and was amazed at how only 15-20 minutes of a love story could effect me so quickly. Not only that, but I didn't expect a story about a senior citizen could be filled with so much adventure and fun. I picked up the movie on Blu-ray after showing my 18 month old daughter the Pixar Shorts Collection dvds where she was completely enraptured by Dug's Adventure short. Mix him in with Kevin the bird and the colorful balloons used to move the house across the world, and she loves watching it just as much as my fiance and I do.",1382572800,,645,4.209677419354839

I don't know if Amazon does not carry the 3D version or what, but I specifically ordered 3D and did not get it.  Because we are were looking forward to a 3D version, it made the movie a little disappointing & perhaps even distracting, as we kept waiting for the 3D to kick in.",1381968000,,401,4.181818181818182

7568535,5,B019A3QMJA,"I bought this for a friend who loves and trains dogs, because no one who loves dogs should be without this. By now I'm sure everyone knows the story, but if you just arrived on this planet, Ed Asner is the voice of a grumpy grieving old man who has lost the love of his life and is about to lose his home. He and a stowaway boy are plunged into an exotic adventure which is of course great fun. But the moving part comes from the back story of this grumpy old man, from when he was young and full of vague dreams, then older and in love, through the pain of not being able to have children and the desolation of losing his wife. It is terribly real and it is so surprising to find it in a child's animation. And yet it seems incredibly worthwhile that children should be exposed to the idea that the ""old"" people they know have real lives with real joys and sorrows. And that even old people have room to grow and love to share. Bring the hankies.",1381104000,,947,4.096774193548387

7568581,4,B019A3QMJA,"All the factors that make Pixar the best of the computer animation studios are present in UP. Not only do they produce the highest quality animation but they consistently produce the most sympathetic and believable characters. Although it's true to say that all the obvious buttons are pushed here no one does it quite like Pixar, and a touching story about love and loss becomes truly life-affirming in their hands. The casting and voice acting are first rate, as one would expect, and the story is inventive and compelling. UP is poignant but also funny, and provides classic all-round family entertainment.",1377993600,,609,5.03960396039604

Even though they had seen it before they were engrossed in it again both on the trip to and from our destination. It is truly an up-lifting story that spans the years of youthful anticipation and elderly disappointment. The characters connect so intimately as the ""circle of life"" unfolds before you.

It tells the story of a couple who marry and live a life together, eventually parting when the wife dies as an elderly lady. It is sad up through this part, then the story launches into life without your first love and creating a new adventure.

It was fantastic. Down-to-Earth (well, except when he is above earth, flying... It is called Up), and portrays life as we can relate.

This film was definitely more about analyzing the goals we set out to achieve and the disillusionment we encounter through struggle while growing older, i.e. the human condition, rather than flight and adventure, per se; nonetheless, a most wonderful journey for all ages.

7568710,5,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Carl Fredricksen spent his entire life dreaming of exploring the globe and experiencing life to its fullest. But at age 78, life seems to have passed him by, until a twist of fate (and a persistent 8-year old Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell) gives him a new lease on life.

The voice cast led by Ed Asner (as Carl Fredericksen) & Christopher Plummer (as Charles Muntz) is excellent! The directing by Pete Docter (who also did the story to ""Toy Story"" (1995) & ""Toy Story 2"" (1999), he also did the story to ""Wall-E"" (2008) and wrote the story and directed ""Monsters, Inc."" (2001) & Bob Peterson (who also wrote the screenplay and who also did the voice of Dug and Alpha) (he also wrote the screenplay to ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) is excellent! John Lasseter executive produced, he has executive produced almost all of Pixar's films, with the exception of ""Toy Story 1 & 2"" (wrote the stories to both of them and directed them), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998, also wrote the story and directed) & ""Cars"" (2006, he also wrote the story and screenplay and directed), he will also executive produced the upcoming ""Toy Story 3"" (2010).

The music by Michael Giacchino (who also did the music to ""Star Trek"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Land Of The Lost"" (2009), he also did the music to ""The Incredibles"" (2004) & ""Ratatouille"" (2007) is excellent! The production design by Ricky Nierva is excellent! The art direction by Ralph Eggleston (who also co-wrote the story to ""Monsters, Inc."", he also did the production design to ""Wall-E"" & ""Finding Nemo"", he also did the art direction to ""Toy Story"" & ""The Incredibles""), Bryn Imagire, Harley Jessup (who also did the production design to ""Ratatouille"" & ""Monsters, Inc."") & Don Shank is excellent!

This is another hit and a masterpiece from Pixar and Disney after ""Wall-E"". This is another impressive achievement in animation. This is also the best film of the year, so far, by far.",1369526400,,1963,4.750733137829912
7568711,5,B019A3QMJA,This is such a cute story! I rented it to see what all the hype was about and it did not disappoint.  You follow the journey of a young boy who falls in love and grows old.  One of my favorite animated movies!,1369526400,,209,3.8372093023255816
7568712,4,B019A3QMJA,"Watched Up today for the first time in years (maybe since it first came out), and my memory of it has shifted somewhat. I still think the movie's strength is in the first 15 minutes or so, but the ending is more effective and emotional than I had remembered.

Up is a strangely unique film in that it has very well-defined characters, but not a very engaging storyline. The two heros, Carl Fredericksen and Russell, are brought to life so vividly and organically, they are literally three-dimensional personalities.

Russell, one of the most delightful creations to come out of Pixar Animation Studios, is perhaps more interesting because so much of his tragic backstory is hidden, and we hear just pieces of it. He throws in comments like how his father doesn't have time for him anymore, or how his mother won't let him have a pet, but these clearly sad circumstances are expressed with the earnestness and surface-level indifference that a young boy would have in real life.

Where the movie lets us down is in its overall narrative; there are many amusing scenes with the exotic ""snipe"" bird Kevin and the talking dog Dug, but the whole conflict surrounding Carl's childhood hero Charles Muntz is, to me at least, not particularly interesting or compelling. It seems to slow down the ""real"" story, of Carl and Russell, rather than contribute to it.

Fortunately, this doesn't take up too much of the movie - the last 15 minutes or so bookends the stellar opening with their life back in the city, and how their friendship continues even after their adventure. Up, at times, is painfully moving and emotional, which unfortunately gets lost in some extraneous narrative. It's worth sticking through, though, for the satisfying ending.",1369440000,,1736,4.894557823129252

7568732,5,B019A3QMJA,"What can I say, but yet another Disney movie that our family loves! Heart touching moments that Disney has come to be known for and some really funny ones too. The beginning is sad to watch as the old man grows up with the love of his life who he marries. They enjoy adventures and wanted to live on top of a certain mountain someday. They find they can't have children which is heartbreaking for them and she becomes ill and dies. After mourning her loss and developers are forcing him to move, he decides to move his entire home to the very mountain they dreamed about, using masses of balloons. The movie becomes funny once the young boy shows up to try an earn a merit badge by helping the old man with anything that will earn him the badge. The old man of course just wants him to go, but the boy is determined to help and accidentally finds himself stuck on the house once it gets airborne.

This movie is all ""in the feels."" Good and sad. My husband and I both alternated in tearing up and laughing. It's a great mix of profound emotion and innocent humor.

7568751,5,B019A3QMJA,"I'm a fan of all things Disney and all things Pixar but this movie certainly ranks in my top 5.  Pixar manages to tell an amazing story weaving through an amazing love story along with 2 coming of age stories.  It's easy to see how/why this movie won awards.

In addition to all of the above are the plethora of non-human characters...Doug is my favorite (by far)!",1366761600,,364,4.402985074626866

7568756,5,B019A3QMJA,"This is one of Pixar's best films.  Like any great kids movie it deals with very heavy adult issues and it does so in a way that is easy to explain to children.

The use of 3D hasn't stood up as well as the story however.  While there are good uses in a few scenes Up does not stand up well against Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc. which were converted to 3D a few years later.

If you're looking for a quality movie that both children and adults can enjoy, look no further.  But if your looking for a kids movie that will show off your 3D tv, I would suggest a more recent Pixar movie like Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.",1366675200,,617,4.024590163934426

I still get emotional at the beginning and I have seen the movie over a dozen times...  That specific scene was handled in a perfect way for children, and some adults, to understand and process.  Kudos to the writers for this!  Currently shares the #1 spot in my mind with Finding Nemo.",1366243200,,391,4.542857142857143

7568766,5,B019A3QMJA,"That is a strong statement coming from someone who has watched Toy Story since he was a small child.  But I truly believe that UP is Pixar's finest achievement.

The movie starts with the most heartbreaking and tear-jerking opening I have ever witnessed in a film. Not many things, in film or otherwise, can just push me to cry out of sheer emotion, but by god, UP had me in tears more than once during its 96 minutes.  The opening shows how the protagonist,  balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, met his future wife, Ellie, as a boy.  She is adventurous and energetic, and shows Carl all her secrets about what she wants most direly to do when she gets older: build her dream house on the edge of Paradise Falls, a beautiful waterfall in South America.  The film then goes on to show a summary of the couple's life, from marriage to old age, and finally the death of Ellie, leaving Carl a bitter old man.  This scene only lasts about ten minutes, but it had me sobbing.  It was probably the most touching thing I've ever witnessed in a film.  As Nostalgia Critic said, they probably could have ended the film right after that scene and it would have still been amazing.

Carl begins his dull day, and we meet the boy scout,ahem, ""Wilderness Explorer"", Russell. He's a determined kid who wants to earn his final badge, Assisting the Elderly.  He reminds Carl not only of himself as an adventurous kid, but as the son he never had. (Oh, did I mention Ellie couldn't conceive? Did I also mention how sad that opening is?) Anyway, Carl is annoyed by him at first, but over the course of the movie, they form a strong bond, trust me.

That's as much of the story I'll give away, as I would like to say a little about the animation.  It is unbelievable.  Pixar always demands high expectations, but lord, this film is gorgeous, especially on Blu-Ray.  The colors are beyond vivid and pleasant to look at, and the attention to detail is astounding.  As the movie progresses, Carl begins to grow white stubble on his face, as he doesn't have the time to shave.  The fur on the dogs looks so real, but the dogs themselves are cartoony in design.  It makes for a perfect blend of realism and cartoony-ness that makes Pixar's animation so charming.

This movie is quite perfect, from its characters to its story to its animation.  It is paced extraordinarily well, hitting you with powerful emotions one moment, and having you chuckling or outright guffawing at a well-placed joke the next.  It has all the quality Pixar is known for times ten.  I not only believe this is Pixar's greatest masterpiece, but it is certainly one of my favorite films of all time.  I cannot recommend it enough.",1365984000,,2679,4.546972860125261
7568767,5,B019A3QMJA,Whole family loved this one. Have watched it so many times we can and all do quote it. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.,1365897600,,119,3.8

7568769,3,B019A3QMJA,"The movie was ok but not great. Compared to movies like despicable me and The incredibles it takes a back seat. Not enough funny moments as I had hope. That said,my daughter loved it.",1365724800,,183,4.411764705882353
7568770,5,B019A3QMJA,"The story was quite an adventure.  It followed an lonely old may and an equally lonely child looking for something and finding it in each
other.",1365638400,,144,4.538461538461538
7568771,5,B019A3QMJA,my wife really wanted this film because she is still a very big kid at heart. so i got it for her and with in the first 10 mins of the movie she was crying becasue is was so sweet and sad. SPOILER the wife dies early on. but the film as some really funny parts to it. but like i said just didn't have the normal disney feel for it.,1365638400,,331,3.676056338028169
7568772,5,B019A3QMJA,"When I first saw this movie I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I can't really say why, perhaps I was in a crappy mood that day.  But, when I saw it again, it truly amazed me.  Maybe the experience of watching it in 3D at home just seemed more personal and this is probably the most personal Pixar movie to date.

Whatever the reason, this movie is awesome.  I loaned it to a friend who text me 15 minutes into and was angry at me for making her cry.  But after the end of the movie she was thanking me for introducing her to such an ""amazing"" movie.",1365638400,,549,3.9454545454545453

7568774,5,B019A3QMJA,Great 3D movie! The kids love it and the visual presentation truly takes advantage of the 3D technology. Objects pop from screen to living room gorgeously. Brilliant.,1365465600,,166,5.185185185185185
7568775,4,B019A3QMJA,"originally saw UP in the theater in 2D.  This type cartoon is improved by the 3D process.  If you like this type kid, adult friendly, cartoon then you will like UP.  I recommend the 3D version to maximumize the experience.",1365379200,,222,4.5
7568776,5,B019A3QMJA,The video was excellent I like how you can buy movies from amazon and watch it instantly my children love it,1365292800,,108,4.190476190476191
7568777,5,B019A3QMJA,I like this adventure. it's quirky. the hero is kind of an anti-hero. the little boy isn't perfect and good-looking like so many stories. everyone is flawed. and there's also a great sense of loss that is very touching. but it's fun to watch and I think adults and children like the idea of flying away with balloons and fulfilling a life-long dream.,1365206400,,350,4.571428571428571

7568781,4,B019A3QMJA,"I chose this movie cause i like disney movies for the most part.  I would say its for children 7 and up more so  cause its a little dark in its content.  meaning in the first several minutes a boy meets a girl, they show them growing up, getting married, they try to have a child but cant, they grow old and then the wife dies.  I think a kids movie should be more upbeat than that.  An then later one of the boy/old guys heros from childhood is meet  and it starts off good but then it turns and he is tring to kill the boy/old man.  So i liked it but If you are thinking about showing it to your kids you may want to give it a test drive first.",1365033600,,646,3.81203007518797

7568795,5,B019A3QMJA,"I, previously, purchased this movie on Blu Ray and I loved.  This is not just a children's cartoon but it works for kids.  It tells you all that you need to know about Love, and Life. It shows, the Ups and Downs of Marriage and Life in General.  How, we set goals and do not always reach them because of external factors.  It shows selfishness and unselfishness.  The ideals of saving and putting others first, even when it costs us our dreams. Showing, it is wrong, wanting to just possess things and not thinking about the consequences and harm.  That is just part of the story.  I would say that 3D, as it is done right, makes the movie 100% more interesting. Loving it, start to finish.",1363996800,,690,4.3858267716535435

It's difficult to describe without spoilers, but I can say this:  The back story - the context for the plot - is a masterwork.  The thought that went into the characters is phenomenal and the entire movie glows with the same polish.

7568885,3,B019A3QMJA,Up: The advertising hype was more than the movie.  The premise was good but the movie was disappointing for me.,1358726400,,111,4.55
7568886,4,B019A3QMJA,"Ed Asner as Carl the Curmudgeon-y widower is very impressive. Jordan Nagai as Russell is actually not too cloying. Bob Peterson steals the show as Dug (and Alpha). The history of Carl and his wife is a pretty painful pill to swallow, as is the amount of sentimentality constantly represented by the souvenirs left in the house, but it's thankfully balanced by the lighthearted comedy that the dogs provide.

While I don't think the movie was great, the reminders of Carl's wife Ellie frequently somber the mood and often Russel tip-toes into ""too dumb to live"" territory, the lush scenery and Ed Asner being Bad-ass Senior really raise a run-of-the-mill adventure into something majestic. Surprisingly, there was no extra about what happened to Muntz considering he was last seen on the house.

As for the extras, Dug's adventure is more slapstick hilarity involving the dogs while Partly Cloudy was a disturing tale of a psychotic cloud.",1358640000,,938,5.006410256410256

7568890,5,B019A3QMJA,"though my review isn't going to be as awesome and thorough like a lot of others, i just have to comment on how beautiful this story is.  i agree with a lot of others that even though its a pixar animated movie, its just as much for adults, if not more than it is for kids.  not ratings-wise but content wise.

the story follows the old man through his love, loss and promises, and the journey along the way.

I will admit, i started crying in the first 10 minutes of the movie, its so incredibly sweet, and it reminded me of my own grandparents in that they were each others first and ONLY love, and my mama just recently passed, so the movie reeeally connected with me on that level because i can see my papa in the old man in the movie.

it's definitely a little different than your typical animated film, but if you're into the kind of more mature animated subjects and dig a sweet story, then definitely give this movie a shot.  you won't be disappointed.",1358467200,4,959,4.2707182320441985

Heck, it tackles many of life's issues better than a whole marathon of sappy Lifetime Channel dramas and it will not wring you out, it will lift you up!  While watching this movie, everyone in the room will find someone to identify with, from the smallest child to the oldest adult and anyone in between.  It's one of the movies that needs to be watched a couple of times because it has so much packed into it.  It's funny, inspirational, and even surprisingly sad (kids won't catch the sad parts the way that adults will understand them).  Watch this one together...you'll miss out if you use this one to simply entertain the kids while you cook dinner.  It's well worth the whole family's time and attention.",1358380800,4,791,4.574468085106383

7568894,5,B019A3QMJA,"I was talking about the movie to a friend and I decided to send it to her myself. This is a perfect example of an animated movie that is definitely more for the parents than for the kids. It was funny and sad and imaginative, it makes you look at life and all the things that can happen and how it's never too late to pursue your dreams.

7568970,1,B019A3QMJA,"Well, everybody has to jump the shark sometime, right? The A-Team had Stockwell, MASH had Alan Alda as a director, Firefly had the entire fourth disc (The last four episodes have their moments, but let's be honest: They're not anywhere near as well written as the episodes on the previous discs. The Bounty Hunter and the Brothel villains were so 2 dimensional you could use them to split atoms and not initiate a nuclear event.).

And Pixar has Up. WARNING: THE FOLLOWING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.

Savvy credit-watchers will note that Up does not boast the involvement of John Lasseter at all, and Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird except in the role of ""Executive Producers."" ""Executive Producer"" is a Hollywood term that means ""I'll give you some money and take the credit for your success, but I'm not doing any work.""

This is understandable. Lasseter, Stanton and Bird have been practically living in the studio since Toy Story. They have families, and they've made a pile of money. I don't blame them one bit for wanting to spend more time with their kids. Unfortunately, like Jim Henson's death, they took all the magic with them and what remained was only someone trying desperately to imitate what was uniquely inimitable.

Like all Pixar movies, Up is technically impressive. The visuals are stunning in some places, and the animation is exquisite (whoever researched the dogs earned his money.) Unlike Pixar movies, however, the writing leans too heavily on sight gags and shies away from character exploration almost entirely. It's like a Dreamworks movie got lost and Pixar kidnapped it. (Hey-yoh!)

There are a lot of things wrong with the movie, but I think the fundamental problem is the lack of empathy. Every other Pixar movie has been the manifestation of some passion or affection that men like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird had for something. Toys and Finding Nemo were about their kids. Cars was about their parents. Ratatouille was about their own passion for creation. No matter what the movie, either Bird or Stanton (or both) were speaking through the main characters. It's why the movies were so good, why the characters rang so true. They were honest.

The creative heads behind Up not only fail to empathize with the main character, they don't even seem to like him at all. Let's have a look at what happens to the main character through the course of the movie.

1) He meets the love of his life in a decrepit, run-down old house, and falls through the ceiling and breaks his arm. (They later buy the house and fix it up as a married couple)
2) He marries the love of his life, and they attempt to have children but an apparent miscarriage leaves her barren. (I say ""apparent"" because that scene is part of a musical montage of their relationship that takes up about 10 minutes of the first reel.)
3) During the musical montage, they decide to follow their childhood dreams by setting up a savings jar to go exploring, but on three occasions, they have to use the money in the savings jar to pay for emergencies.
4) During the musical montage, the main character buys plane tickets to the Amazon so they can fulfill their dreams of being explorers in their retirement.
5) But before he can present the tickets to her, she has a heart attack and dies. During the musical montage.
6) The neighborhood around the house he and his wife rebuilt from the ground has gone commercial. Surrounded by glass and steel monoliths, he is the last holdout and won't sell to the developer.
7) A construction worker backs over his mailbox, which he and his wife hand painted during the musical montage, and though well meaning won't let the old man repair it himself.
8) The old man gets evicted from his house after hitting the construction worker who wouldn't let him have his mailbox over the head with his cane.
9) The old man flies his house to the Amazon, following the footsteps of the childhood hero he and his wife shared, and the reason why they wanted to explore the amazon in the first place.
10) Only it turns out that his childhood hero is a homicidal lunatic who sets his house on fire and subsequently tries to kill him.
So in the course of the movie, he loses his wife, his house, and his childhood hero. But it's all okay because he helped a small, annoying kid rescue a large, annoying bird.

Furthermore, nobody in the movie listens to the main character or seems to care about him at all. The land developers won't listen to him. The guys from the old folk's home won't listen to him. The annoying kid that accidentally tagged along on the trip to the Amazon won't listen to him. His childhood hero won't listen to him. The talking dog, who is the lone bright spot in the movie, won't listen to him. The only person in the movie who gave a rat's rear end what the main character thought about anything was killed off in the first ten minutes.

His character isn't even well written. When we initially meet him, he's shy. Almost timid. Under his wife's influence, he's happy. But after her death, he turns into cranky old coot stereotype number 7, Asner variant. Sure, his house is surrounded by skyscrapers and construction workers, but his transformation from mousey balloon vendor to crusty old fart is so sudden that I can't help but wonder if the only contact the writers had with old people came from watching Abe Vigoda and Wolford Brimley movies. Memo to Pixar: Not every old person living alone is perpetually cranky.

And he's not the only character who's taken directly from the Saturday Morning TV School of Character Stereotypes. The other primary character is a chubby boy scout who is seeking his ""helping the elderly"" merit badge. He's your standard annoying, wise-beyond-his-years preadolescent whose innocence will show the old man the error of his ways. At one point, the kid is talking about his estranged father (Aww! He lacks a father figure. And look! The main character lacks a son! I wonder where this is going...) he remarks that what he really remembers is the little, boring, everyday stuff that he did get to do, not the big, important stuff that he didn't. That thud you hear is the message being delivered like a sack of tainted meat into a dumpster. Pardon me while I gag myself with a screwdriver.

The villains aren't particularly fleshed out either. The land developer has no dialog, and exists primarily as a man with a cell phone who stands in for corporate soullessness (lessness... lessness... lessness.) I won't harp on him, because he's not really supposed to be a fleshed out villain, though I will point out that Pixar has done the Corporate Villain so much better in both Monster's Inc and The Incredibles.

The other villain, which you could see coming from the start of the movie if you pay close enough attention, is the main character's childhood hero. A celebrated explorer, he is disgraced when scientists dispute his findings of a seven foot tall bird that roams the remotest regions of the Amazon rainforest. He sets out for the rainforest, vowing to return only when he has positive proof that he's not a liar. When we find him next, he is not merely bitter at his mistreatment at the hands of the press, but downright bat-guano insane. It is strongly intimated that he murdered any explorer/archaeologist/botanist who he ever encountered in the rainforest because he suspected them of trying to capture his bird and steal his glory.

The main problem with the villain is that the writers think that ""bat-guano-insane"" is a substitute for personality. Every other villain in a Pixar movie has had human motivations, and has been sympathetic to some degree. Even the Aussie dentist in Finding Nemo was more clueless than evil. This guy is just completely inhuman, and not in the ""I believe what I was programmed to believe"" way that the Wheel was in Wall-E. He's just... one-dimensional. It's like someone said ""Oh, let's just make him a hunter who kills people. That's good enough, right?"" and everyone just nodded.

The one character, or group of characters, that are well written and fully realized are the dogs. The villain has an enormous pack of dogs at his command, and he has outfitted them with collars that translate their thoughts into English. This opens up the inevitable ""I would like that ball!"" and ""SQUIRREL!"" jokes that actually work. They're the only thing in the movie that does.

I'd be more willing to forgive the cardboard characters if the rest of the movie wasn't taken whole cloth from the clich factory as well. The whole denouement is so laughably derivative I would accuse it of being brilliant parody if they weren't taking themselves so seriously. The villain sets the main character's house on fire as a distraction, because the main character is defending the large bird. Seeing his whole life go up in flames, the old man rushes to extinguish the flames, leaving the villain open to waltz off with the bird. How the main character was supposed to stop the villain, who at the time was flanked by his army of vicious dogs and carrying a rifle that acts like a shotgun, isn't discussed. But the annoying kid is very disappointed at the main character for just letting the bird go.

After the kid yells at the old man for acting like a human being instead of some paragon of selfless giving (+1), the old man reverts to full on grouch mode and takes his house to finish what he set out to do in the first place. And he does it, by jiminy. The house sets down right where he and his wife planned to build their retirement home.

But it's all hollow. We know this, because as he puts the furniture back where it belongs and rehangs the pictures on the walls the score plays sad music, and the color scheme is just slightly muted, even the photograph of his wife seems to look down on him in disappointment. All that was missing was him looking at a mirror with a melancholy expression, only to turn away in disgust at what he had become. And quite frankly, I'm not altogether certain he didn't. By this point in the movie my eyes were rolling so much I'm sure I missed some things.

When the kid shows up and steals some balloons so he can chase after the bird himself, the main character finally ""gets it."" He expunges the house of everything inside, so the withering balloons could lift what remained skyward once more. The last we see of the furniture, as the house flies away, is his chair sitting neatly next to his wife's chair on the ground as the triumphal music swells and eggs the old man onward and upward. (Yeah! You dump that old crappy symbol of the life you had with your wife. Forget her, it's time to go save some kid you don't know and a bird you don't like!) He chases after the villain, who has captured the annoying child and left him tied to a chair and ready to drop from the loading dock of his blimp to the ground so many thousands of feet below. The villain and the main character have a climactic battle that employs a clumsy version of the ""I threw my back out"" joke that was so much better in The Incredibles. See, it's funny because they're both so old. Also old people smell like prunes.

Seriously. That's how the dogs find him as he sneaks aboard the villain's airship. They smell prunes. They couldn't even spare the cash for some additional syllables and use the word ""liniment.""

Needless to say, the kid is rescued. The villain was dispatched through the use of a high-fall the likes of which I haven't seen since I watched every movie that ever came out between 1985 and 1999.

Finally, we're treated to a scene where the annoying kids finally gets his helping the elderly merit badge, with the main character standing by his side because the kid's father couldn't be there (all together now: Awwww!) and then they go share ice cream and count different color cars, just like the kid used to do with his dad (and again: Awwwwww!) and apparently the court order remanding the old man to a home has been rescinded, or at least it's unenforceable because he now lives in the villain's airship.

Oh, and just to throw a bone to those of us who understood why it was important to the main character to keep a promise he made to his wife so many years ago, the last we see of the house, it just happened to land right where he wanted to put it. What a coincidence.

I suppose Up was an accurate enough title for the movie, given the infatuation with flight. But if they wanted to make it more accurate and a whole lot more descriptive they would have called it ""Trite.""

That's not something I ever thought I'd be able to say about a Pixar movie. Usually they come right up to the edge of being trite without actually falling off the precipice. This one just points the car at the edge of the cliff and lays down rubber.

I have more complaints, like about how this movie is a violent departure from Pixar's classical themes about how nostalgia is a good and fundamentally human emotion, and the fact that it's not only okay, but admirable that people have attachments to physical objects. Heck, if the people who made Up had done Cars, the residents of Radiator Springs would just pack up and move to California, because it's just a road, right? Move on.

But I'm running long, so I won't. In conclusion, I just want to say that I will no longer buy a Pixar movie on DVD just because Pixar did it. It was my last vestige of fanboy mentality, and Up snuffed it out. I don't know whether I should be angry or grateful.",1355097600,10,13469,4.6040016673614

Charles Muntz the guy who's after a rare bird...wait a minute! They already did that with McLeach in ""The Rescuers Down Under."" McLeach was much more interesting than this guy.

7569020,5,B019A3QMJA,"I am grateful to Pixar who have elevated animation from incipid to incredible.  Pixar remembers that you have to get the audience to care about the characters so they developed these ones very carefully.  They tell a carefully crafted story that is so original, so funny and so moving that you forget it is animation.

I am not a spoiler reviewer so I want to say as little about the content as possible.  This is not because the content is lacking but because it is lively and robust and I want you to experience what I experienced when I pressed ""play"".  I think that too many people have forgotten the love of movies, just watching one without watching all the trailer.  You just watch without knowing what to expect and enjoying the ride.

My only critique is a technical one in that I couldn't get the menu button to work so I don't know if there are any special features or behind the scenes.

This far exceeded my expectations and runs the gambit of emotions with a witty, hilarious and sweet story that will have you guessing until the end.  I hate that most animations have in the back of their heads that there will be a sequel.  This story is the story without any pretense of sequels that can ruin the storyline.

The voice acting is wonderful, the characters funny and experiencing a journey, and the jokes don't get too trite or overly simplistic. Great fun for everyone whether you've got kids, want to watch something fun on a quiet night in, or are looking for a nice group movie. Highly recommended! The Amazon streaming quality was quite good, although occasionally a little choppy. However, I'm not sure if that was their fault or the internet connection.

Every curmudgeon was once an adventurous and wide eyed child but as life takes you on its unpredictable path, you can lose sight of that and forget. Up is an adventure story of the best kind. A disillusioned old man realizes that true joy, the stuff of life, isn't about the destination but lies in meaningful companionship while on the journey. The movie has serious undertones but young Russell keeps things lively. His youthful enthusiasm initially annoys the old man who is set on reaching his life long destination spot at Paradise Falls. At the outset of their unplanned adventure together, the old man is grouchy, impatient, and sees the kid as a nuisance. Later, in the true spirit of adventure, the old man discovers that he and Russell have something in common, they need each other.",1342483200,,828,4.7972027972027975
7569053,5,B019A3QMJA,"To be honest, the first time I saw Up in theatres, I liked it, but I just did not see what everyone was so excited about. I kept thinking to myself, ""What's the big deal?"" I am very happy to say that I finally see what the big deal is. Up is a beautiful, heartfelt story. It captures the life of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) perfectly from his youth, to his golden years. The montage near the beginning was one of the most wonderful things that I have ever seen, and probably the most wonderful thing that I have seen in a Pixar film to date. The scene itself set a variety of moods, from sad to joyous, but the music really brought it to life. It was perfectly set to another great score by Michael Giacchino, who also blew me away with his Star Trek score. In my opinion, Up has to be the best Pixar film yet. They have done nothing but good things for the last couple of decades. It seems like everything they make becomes a classic. Until I saw Up for the second time, I would never have imagined myself ever saying that it was the best they have done so far. But it is the truth. The imagination is a beautiful thing, and those guys over at the Disney Pixar studios have plenty of it. I loved the maturity in the tone of the story, even though it remained a children's' movie all the way through. I'm sure not too many kids would have picked up on the little hints like, *Possible Spoiler* why they were sad in the pregnancy doctor's office, or why Ellie couldn't make it up that hill, etc. But those are the kinds of things that make both children and adults love these movies so much. There is something in it for every single person in the crowd. Everything in the film is well done, but this story is undoubtedly character driven.

The characters were all delightful. Carl reminded me so much of my own grandpa. So sad deep inside from the lost of his wife, and so grumpy because of his sadness, but also so caring for others and eager for adventure. Russell, I'll admit he annoyed me at first, but I soon realized that's what he was supposed to do. We were supposed to feel what Carl felt. Then over time, as we heard Russell's story and saw how nice of a person he was, we grew to care about him like we did for Carl. Doug and Kevin were great from the start. Even though Doug started off trying to capture Kevin for his master, he was always so sweet and funny that we never disliked him for it. Kevin made me laugh out loud a couple of times, especially when he mimicked Carl. Charles Muntz was an unlikely, yet great villain. He was the sole motivation for Ellie and Carl's fixation on South America, but his dedication to his quest drove him crazy. This was just an all around fantastic movie. The only reason I cannot give it a full score is the little things that I didn't like, like the dogs flew the airplanes and tied Russell up. The explanation for them being able to speak was acceptable, and the fact that they could speak added dimension to them as characters, and ultimately the story itself. But then they did those things that pulled me out of the story. Yeah, I do understand that the whole premise of a floating house, and everything is not really based on anything practical, and nor does it try to pretend that it is possible. Of course it's a children's movie, and they are expected to be like that. I just didn't like those aspects of it, but they didn't take anything away from how brilliant the overall film was. It was a masterpiece. I cannot wait for Toy Story 3, and whatever Pixar has slated after that.",1341792000,4,3555,4.29806259314456

I love that there is nothing offensive in it at all and its not the usual characters; it shows the journey of two people who start out as young children.  they meet and grow up together, get married, have a life, and grow old together.  the elderly man from that relationship is the main charector in this CHILDRENS film!  finally a film brings the relevance of the older generation back to the youth!  so much focus is placed on children ""playing"", and - face it - in movies the ""older generation"" is either boring or villains.  the older gentleman and a young boy unwillingly partner up for a great adventure, learn to bridge the gap between their ages, and discover that they can identify with one another and become friends.

7569096,5,B019A3QMJA,"A nearly perfect ballet of simplicity and complexity, one that permeates the technical, emotional, and thematic elements of the film.

Although the premise may seem deceptively shallow, UP flourishes on its own ability to express a hell of a lot without saying much at all.

This stands as Pixar's most emotionally shattering film to date, as well; only the most stubborn of souls won't be roiling in quiet sorrow as early as fifteen minutes into UP.  There are some moments in which it seems rushed, particularly after the duo meets their sole antagonist, but this decision ultimately helps the simple concept from compromising itself, as well as keeping the attention of youngsters (who will adore this movie, by the way).

I didn't think that things could get much better with Brad Bird having helmed films such as Ratatouille and The Incredibles, and my expectations weren't terribly high after discovering the directing talent behind the movie (Pete Docter, who was partially responsible for Monsters, Inc. - the one Pixar film I found more than a little unappealing) but, alas, this absolutely superlative company has surprised me yet again.

7569098,5,B019A3QMJA,"Probably the best animated film this decade. Up is one of those films that makes you look at yourself, at all the promises you made to yourself that one day, that magical day, when you have enough money, when you win the lottery, when you get a break in your schedule, you're going to take that trip, treat yourself out to that nice dinner you deserve, do that thing you've always planned from the time you were bold enough to dream. Once upon a time you were a cub scout, the world was a magical place awaiting exploration. Then one day you woke up, looked in the mirror, opened your front door, and realized that you were old and all you have left are memories and old pictures of the way you used to look when you were young.

This is the perfect family movie. I say this because usually when you hear the words ""family film"" it's usually a film that is very basic, basic and safe enough to take your kid to see. Rarely do you see a film that is basic enough for a kid to get into yet sophisticated enough for an adult to relate with on a level that a child who hasn't been through life's changes cannot possibly understand. Up is that type of film, about an old man holding on to the past, to an old dream, resisting the changes occurring around him. Ed Asner of Mary Tyler Moore fame plays the gruff irascible Mr. Henrick who, along with a stowaway scout named Russel set out for South America's Paradise Falls by way of a cloud of colorful balloons anchored to an old house full of old dreams.

The animation in this movie is very colorful, vibrant, realistic, and reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films in this respect. In fact, the characterizations in this film, particularly the part played by Asner, the main character, is downright scary at times, seems like a live action movie, not because the animation's all that, but because the emotions and humanity are so damn real and don't seem forced. This, along with another one of my favorites, Wall-E, shows why America stands heads and shoulders above everybody in this medium. Sorry went on so long but there aren't enough superlatives to say how fantastic and beautiful this film is. A true work of art, art that you can feel as well as see.",1320624000,6,2208,4.409313725490196

Yeah, the old man learns and grows and the messages in the film are fine, but the journey, is rough and fearful for the very young.

7569111,5,B019A3QMJA,"This computer-animated feature won all sorts of awards when it was released back in 2009. In the film, Carl Fredricksen (voiced perfectly by Ed Asner) is heartbroken over the loss of his wife, Ellie. The last holdout in a city block destined for high-rise office buildings, Carl is ousted from his home. Rather than turn over the house where he and his late wife enjoyed many years together, Carl ties thousands of helium balloons to the structure and lifts off for a grand adventure.

Unbeknownst to Carl, however, over-eager scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) is trapped on the porch of the floating building. Begrudgingly, Carl teams up with Russell for a hair-raising, heart-warming caper through South America.

I loved this movie. LOVED. I laughed. I cried. I was completely charmed.

I'm not sure that very young children would understand many parts of the movie. Integral to Carl's character is the loss of his wife, which may make for some difficult explanations. However, the movie offers touching comment on love, loss and the true spirit of adventure.

This movie is sooooo worth seeing.",1312588800,,1093,5.0220994475138125
7569112,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up

 The adventurous, animated comedy, titled ""Up"", was released on May 29th, 2009 and it instantly captured peoples' hearts. Up was produced by Pixar Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Pete Docter. Since Up is animated, it doesn't necessarily have actors, but the main characters' voices are played by Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagal, and Bob Peterson. By the time this movie was in theaters for a few weeks and widely popular, it had already brought in a world wide income of $731 million. With all the popularity, Up won two Golden Globe Awards. Up is certainly a movie that all ages would enjoy. The characters are hilarious, the setting is unique, the plot is heartwarming, and the theme is one that everyone could use. It is rated ""PG"" and is a must see for everyone!

 The setting revolves around the characters and what their individual mission is. Carl Fredricksen is a shy, grumpy old man, played by Edward Asner. Although he is portrayed as stubborn in the beginning, as the movie goes on, you begin to see that he is just sad about losing his wife and is lonely. Carl meets a little boy named Russell and thinks he is annoying at first but begins to love him in the end. Russell shows up at Carl's small, quiet home asking Carl to help him with one of his Wilderness Explorer Badges. Russell a clumsy yet caring boy who wants to help, but sometimes makes things worse on accident. His character is voiced by Jordan Nagai. When a serried of events happens and Carl's house floats away in the air, Russell tags along and the house lands in South America facing Paradise Falls. In the jungle on the way to Paradise Falls the two meet a bird which they name Kevin. They feed Kevin and the colorful bird sticks with them. Along the way, the group finds out that Kevin is actually a mom and is looking for her babies. On the adventure they find a talking dog named Dug, who is played by Bob Peterson. Dug is very loyal and sometimes a little spacey. All in all he is a very comedic character and makes the feel of the movie a little less heavy. The characters in Up have personalities that you easily begin to care for and the setting is important to the story.

 The plot of Up is very emotional and although it is sad in parts, it is also very funny in other parts. The beginning of the movie starts off with a flashback of Carl in his child hood. He meets a girl named Ellie and when they grow up they end up getting married. Ellie finds out she cannot have kids and so they make it their mission to save their money to go to Paradise Falls, which is their childhood dream place. They also shared the same childhood dream to meet the famed explorer Charles F. Muntz and that is where they hope to find him. Unfortunately, they must keep paying expense after expense and they never get to complete their dream. Ellie and Carl grow old together and eventually Ellie dies of old age. Carl is left and is very lonely. One day a construction worker comes to Carl's house demanding him to move. They get in a fight over his mailbox and Carl ends up hitting the worker with his cane. The police get involved and decide that Carl needs to go to a retirement home. Meanwhile, a little boy named Russell comes to Carl's door asking if Carl can help him with a badge for his Wilderness Explorer Troop. Carl says no and begins to work on a plan to move his entire house and all its belongings. He comes up with a plan to inflate thousands of balloons and tie them to his house. It works and right before the retirement home people come to get him, he floats away in his house. In the middle, Carl goes on the adventure to get to Paradise Falls and carry out the dream he promised his wife years ago. Suddenly, while in the air, Carl hears a knocking at his front door. He opens it and finds Russell. Carl reluctantly lets Russell in and the two float together. They end up getting caught in a storm and when the house lands, it lands facing Paradise Falls. Carl, who remembers his mission, sets off determined to get to the falls. Along the way they find a bird, in which Russell names Kevin. They also find a dog wearing a translating collar and they discover his name is Dug. Dugs owner turns out to be Charles F. Muntz's. As the group continues, they encounter Dug's pack and they try to take Dug back with them. Dug doesn't want to go though. The group leaves Dug to fend for himself and they are able to get the house to Paradise Falls. Carl sets it down in place and then realizes he needs to save Dug. Carl and Russell lighten the house so they can fly and catch Charles F. Muntz's aircraft. In the end, they save Dug and are able to get Kevin back to her babies. The house makes it back to Paradise Falls. The plot is emotional and may sound all sad, but in the movie there are lots of very funny parts that make it so you just want to keep watching.

 Being a Disney movie, Up of course, would have a good theme. I think that the theme is that you can't accomplish anything unless you get out there and go for it. Ellie and Carl had the dream of moving their clubhouse to the gorgeous Paradise falls. When they were little this seemed possible. As they grew older they saved their money little by little in hopes that someday they would make it. They didn't just sit there and hope it would happen on its own. Carl and Ellie really tried to make it a possibility. Unfortunately things got in the way of their dream, but when Ellie passed away, Carl remade it his dream to accomplish the move. He didn't just sit there then either. Carl thought of a plan and because of his love for Ellie, he had the drive to accomplish it. He pushed through his obstacles and in the end was able to complete his mission. This movie really teaches that you can't be lazy if you want to make something out of your life, you need to get up and work towards it.

 My opinion of this movie was a great one! Up is one of my favorite movies. I absolutely love the meaningful storyline and how the characters really touch you with their personalities. The plot was one that was very adventurous. It kept you wanting more. Although there were sad parts, I still thought this movie was good. The sad parts make it more memorable and you begin to feel for the characters. However, there was a great deal of funny parts as well. The pronounced theme helped make the story a good one for all ages. Anyone could learn from this movie. When I first watched this movie, I was instantly hooked. I can watch this movie over and over again. I would recommend Up to everyone!",1308441600,4,6594,4.344967532467533

7569114,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar Animation Studios is well known for their great movies with original plots and endearing characters. Wether is a non talking robot, an underdog ant, scared monsters, forgotten toys, chef rats, selfish cars or superheroes trying to fit in, they've always have took this inconceivable premises and make instant classics of every and each one of this films. With Up, they took an old man and make him an adventurer. Have you seen anything like it? Well with Up you are going to and have a wonderful time watching it.

As usual with every Pixar film, the plot is awesome and very touching. The beginning of the film is so poignant and perfect that you will be reduced to tears within the first minutes. The characters are so well rounded that you will easily relate to them. Also the score (academy award winner) is spectacular, the animation is awesome and the humor is impeccable. An instant classic through and through.

Video & Audio

Up on BD is absolutely spectacular. All the Pixar catalogue has been release on HD in perfect quality and Up it's no exception. The level of clarity, textures and the animation is superb. You won't found any artifacting or compression in this BD. Completely demo-quality.

Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is the equivalent of the picture in audio. Simply enveloping, clear and mesmerizing.

Bonus Features:
This is a loaded 2-BD discs set that have a lot of goodies. First, you have cine-explore which acts like a PIP commentary track with the director and co-director. Also you have a featurette called ""Adventure is Out there"" which deals with the locations on the film, also you have ""The Many endings for Muntz"" which discusses the many endings the crew wanted to give to the villain. Also you have two shorts that are delightful.

On disc two you have 7-mini documentaries that deals with many aspects of the making of the fil like creating Carl, creating Russell, Dug, Kevin, the score, designing the house and more. Also you got an alternate montage of the opening scene and trailers. Everything is great, insightful and fun.

A DVD and a Digital copy are also offered.

Closing Thoughts:

7569115,3,B019A3QMJA,"I like ""Up"". The things it does well, it does extremely well. Its ""sad"" scenes, the ones centering on Carl's (voiced expertly by Ed Asner) personal journey of dealing with loss and recognizing the facade of his childhood dreams, are really quite beautiful and unreservedly recommended.

The other stuff, however... Well, at the risk of making a pun, it could've probably used a little more time on the drawing board. Dug the dog, for instance, does a Stimpy voice that proved the be the bane of my existence during the scenes in which he is prominent. Be you 5 or 50, there's just nothing cool or funny about a Stimpy voice, and it killed a lot of the already spread-too-thin comedy of the film.

Speaking of 5 or 50, this film is directed at kids, but I would advise parents to watch it first to determine how they feel about it before sharing it with the younger set. I know it's a Pixar cartoon, and Pixar cartoons are universally assumed to be kids' movies, but this film has absolutely NOTHING to do with childhood. As I mentioned, it's about dealing with loss and recognizing the facade of childhood dreams. Are these really problems that kids face? Perhaps I define ""kids' movie"" differently than some, but I just wonder if I were to rotoscope ""Chinatown"" and run commercials for it during reruns of ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" whether or not it would be hailed as a kids' movie. I see the distinction thematically, not aesthetically, is all I'm saying, and I would advise parental discretion.

As for a specific recommendation, my take is that this is not a film that needs to be watched over and over again. While it is good enough to watch once, a DVD or Blu-Ray copy of the film would be extraneous and would inevitably end up just collecting dust on the shelf, with each glance in its direction conjuring memories of the film's weaker moments rather than its strengths.",1307145600,,1880,4.622754491017964

7569117,4,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar can always be counted on to release a cute movie.  This was definitely cute although a little out there in the storyline.

After his adventurous wife of many years dies, Mr. Fredericksen turns somewhat recluse.  It had always been their dream to go to Paradise Falls and live there and when he's about to be shipped off to a retirement home, Mr. Frederickson gets an idea.  When they come to collect him the next day, he and his house take off while tied to hundreds of balloons.  The only problem is the local Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell was on his porch and is carried along with him.  They manage to land, but not quite near Paradise Falls and with the house still floating they decide to drag it around to the falls.  But some strange characters show up, a wild colorful bird, and a talking dog, and things start to get a little more interesting.  Namely when the talking dog turns out to belong to a old hero of Mr. Frederickson's and is desperate to get ahold of the strange bird and take it away from its babies.

For characters all the voice actors did a great job.  I really liked Mr. Frederickson, he was a great character and while surly, still lovable.  Russell on the other hand drove me nuts, its a bit harsh but I kept hoping Darwinism would kick in for him as he just kept doing such stupid things for a kid his age.  I loved the bird and the dog, the dog especially since it could talk really sounded and acted like what I thought a dog would.  The other talking dogs were great as well. *Spoilers ahead*  Another problem character I had was the crazy explorer after the bird, he was really evil for being in a child's movie and trying to kill a child in it.

For a plot it was pretty simplistic but charming all the same.  Sure there's a lot of unbelievable aspects but it is a kid's movie and fantasy elements can be accepted.  I have to say that my favorite part of the movie was probably in the beginning where it showed snapshots and Mr. Frederickson and his wife's life together.  Since it was pixar you know the graphics were good, and they really did a wonderful job on the animations.  It was very colorful.

Not a bad Pixar movie, there are others out there I like better, but this one was rather sweet.  Definitely a good kid's movie.

7569130,1,B019A3QMJA,"I can't believe that disney made this depressing movie! I didn't think it was really geared toward children; more toward adults. I found it very sad & depressing.
First off, the movie was described horribly in the preview! The preview looked like a movie about an old man wanting to go see the rainforest, so he attached a bunch of balloons to his house. A young boyscout came up wanting to earn a ""Helping the Elderly"" badge. He got onto the house right at the time of the ""Lift-off"" and comes with him. It shows them in the rainforest and it looked like it was going to be a fun movie about getting back home.
How did the movie start out? He (Carl) met a girl when he was young, they got married, then they wanted children. They go to the doctor's office to find out she is unable to have a child. (Depressing point number one) After that she wanted to go see a waterfall in the rainforest. When he finally got enough money to go, she collapsed and died! (Depressing point number two)

7569133,5,B019A3QMJA,"Just when you think Disney-Pixar animation has hit the ceiling, they come up with another engaging film. ""Up"" ranks as one of the most original tales the team has come up with, featuring one of the most unlikeliest heroes. Carl Fredericksen (perfectly voiced by Ed Asner) was a young boy who idolized Charles Muntz, a revered explorer whose discovery of a rare South American bird fossil turned out to be faked. Forcing him back to the Amazon, Muntz vanishes for years. Carl unexpectedly finds common ground in his dreams of flight & exploration with a sprightly girl named Ellie. In one of the most touching episodic montages I've ever seen, Carl & Ellie live out their lives together: From marriage to daydreaming on a grassy hill to the ""Paradise Falls Fund Jar"" (which keeps getting raided when emergencies arise) to Ellie's illness & subsequent death. Now alone, old and beside himself, Carl is facing the mothballing of his remaining days in a retirement home. What to do? Simple: The retired balloon salesman attaches thousands of colorful balloons to his quaint little home & sails off to Paradise Falls, the place him & Ellie had long ago dreamed of going to. Unfortunately, Carl has picked up a passenger cowering on his porch: Russell, a pudgy Wilderness Scout who's trying to earn a merit's badge for helping the elderly. Russell is soon driving the old curmudgeon crazy.
Upon arrival, Carl soon learns that this expedition is more than he bargained for as Dug--a cute dog fitted with a human-voiced collar--and ""Kevin"", the rare bird of Muntz's obsession--are along for the ride. Sure enough, Carl encounters the elderly Muntz, whose hero worship of him soon turns deadly once the half-crazed Muntz discovers Carl is harboring Kevin. And so, the movie's tempo shifts from a reflective, whimsical tale into an action-packed adventure full of offbeat twists & turns.
In the ""adventure book"" that Ellie leaves behind, she writes to Carl: ""Thanks for the adventure. Now go have a new one!"" And that alone sums up what the film is saying: Never stop living, and be there for the younger generation.
DVD extras include the charming & amusing original short ""Partly Cloudy"", and the new short ""Dug's Special Mission"", an extension of the movie's plot.

STARRING: The Voices of: Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, Delroy Lindo and Jerome Ranft

WRITTEN BY: Pete Docter and Bob Peterson

DIRECTED BY: Pete Docter, Bob Peterson and Thomas McCarthy

Rated: PG
Genre: Animation / Adventure
Release Date: 29 May 2009

What a beautiful film. When I say this about Disney and Pixar's Up, I mean it both for how the film makes us feel as well as the way it looks. It's filled with glorious animation and spectacular colors. This is the kind of film that will inspire you to buy a Blu-Ray player, if you haven't done so already. Vibrant does it minimal justice.

Much like Wall.e, Up is something kids will have a blast with, but will also force them to think. It's not a mindless bouncing off the walls disaster, like so may cartoons have been in the past.

Like most great films, Up centers around a love story. Two kids meet and fall in love at a young age, due mainly to their shared common interest in being explorers. They are Carl and Ellie and we see their relationship grow and prosper and eventually turn into a wholesome marriage. This is all shown to us in what I considered to be the film's most original and touching moment. It's all done without dialogue, and is accompanied by a heartfelt score.

Sadly, Ellie passes away and leaves Carl alone and heartbroken. They had plans together to travel to one of their favorite places: Paradise Falls. They had a jar with their life savings set aside and everything. But as is too often the case, life got in the way of their plans and with unforeseen bills and expenses, the trip was never had. In case it's not blatantly obvious, you're crying your eyes out by this point in the film.

We see that Carl has turned into the sweetest old man imaginable, complete with a full head of white hair and a set of large, dark, square-framed eye glasses. He lost a piece of himself when Ellie died and his beloved home becomes a valuable keepsake for him to remember her by.

When he is threatened with losing his sacred home to a rich tyrant, Carl must act fast. Having several hundreds of balloons stored in his home (which is meaningful to the story) he remedies a brilliant plan. He will take his house, with the help of those balloons and a whole lot of helium, and will fly away to Paradise Falls!

His plan works, but he soon realizes he has unintentionally brought someone along with him; a small boy-scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai).

The two befriend one another and embark on an incredible adventure, involving a classic villain voiced by Christopher Plummer, and several other interesting creatures. Marking it as only the second animated film to ever be nominated for an Oscar for best picture of the year; Up is sure to become a timeless classic.",1296432000,2,2781,4.584677419354839
7569138,5,B019A3QMJA,"Truly a family movie: if parents like it, if senior did it too, and most important, the kids, it is a family movie, loyal to the definition of such. Specially I think the facts that one of the main characters was the senior, makes this movie more unusual (and battling ageism in the society, good thing). The beginning is the senior's story, an old widower is dealing with the sense of isolation and loss, so, smaller children may have trouble to relate,as is to grown up for them. But for sure they will be taken by Kevin, the bird which is represented as very cartoonish character, humorous situations tailored to little ones naive/crude sense of humor. But Kevin is also a mother, and needs to protect her little ones, as a note about empathy. The dog will please everyone, a more complex and grown up character. And there is a story of positive transformation, and victory over the one who is a bad one. Exciting tale, teaching clear ethics too.",1296000000,,949,4.588235294117647

7569142,5,B019A3QMJA,"Disney Pixar's Up is a beautifully animated -though atmospherically quiet and occasionally slow-moving- movie intended mostly for children.  Hey I guess that makes me a big kid for watching it, lol.

It's about an old man who takes a special journey to South America to visit a place he and his wife talked about visiting while the wife was alive.  Well after the wife finally dies, the old man decides to take the journey himself by actually lifting his house off the ground by way of thousands of floating balloons.

It's funny because throughout the film, a crucial element to the storytelling is the old man constantly dragging his floating house around everywhere he goes, lol.  To join him on the adventure is a young boy scout looking for a badge that's awarded for helping the elderly.

Is it just me or does the old man look almost identical to Joe Paterno, Penn State's football coach?  It's almost too hard to believe it's just a coincidence.  Back when I was watching previews of this film from the TV commercials last year, I could have sworn Disney actually designed the old man to look like Joe.  Maybe not...

I don't know about anybody else, but the beginning segment involving the old man as a child and introducing himself to the woman who would turn out to be his wife is REALLY emotional and downright devastatingly sad.  I was seriously sitting there crying as the film quickly went through the motions of the man and woman starting out as children, then growing up and getting married, fixing up their house, not being able to have a baby, growing old, and eventually leading to the wife departing.  Maybe it's just me but the amount of sadness in this particular segment is really unbelievable.

Upon landing in South America, the old man and the boy scout meet up with some animals and have the adventure of a lifetime.

Up is a really good animated film for anyone looking to spend a little entertainment with their family.  I highly recommend it.  Just be warned when watching the first 10 minutes- make sure you have some tissues available, lol.  Really effectively well done bit of storytelling there.  Incredibly touching on so many levels.  The film never goes in *that* direction ever again.  Great movie.",1295568000,4,2237,4.716494845360825
7569143,5,B019A3QMJA,"Grab your husband or significant other (after packing off the kids for a sleep over, if applicable), pour some F.A.B.s (frosty adult beverage) and snuggle up on the couch to watch UP! A wonderful, touching movie about a widower who takes pleasure in circumventing those who would have him move to Shady Acres nursing home and give up the home he and his wife, Ellie, made. Walter, our protagonist, is known as a crotchety old man. What most people don't know is that Walter is a lonely man since his wife and life-long love died. They never made their dream trip to Paradise Falls. Like most of us of a certain age, we plan and dream, hoping to fulfill that dream one day. One day never came for Ellie and Walter; but now that the powers that be think he should be in a retirement home, Walter has a Plan. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, a young scout (Russell), trying to achieve a badge for Elderly Assistance, is caught up in Walter's plan to foil the well-meaning social worker.

This is a Disney/Pixar Studios film, so the images are just spectacular. I have seen the behind the scenes video (included on the discs) where the team of artists travels to Tepui in South America, the area Walter (& Russell) have their adventure. It's amazing how realistic the animation depicts the natural beauty of this area! I don't normally watch the ""Extras"" that come with a dvd, but in this case, made an exception and throughly enjoyed them. From the 3 shorts (including alternate endings) to the aforementioned trip by the artistic team to South America. Another disc is devoted to in depth behind the scenes and documentaries showing their studies of geriatrics to dog breeds. Everything very informative and not boring. The set also includes a digital copy of the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-Four-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001KVZ6G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>]. There is also a game (Global Guardian Badge game--a geography skills game that can be set for different skill levels), a 'deleted scene' piece on married life and a montage of stills (kinda a blooper reel feel) of various characters doing funny things/situations. Very funny stuff, especially for children.
All in all, this is a lush, amazing movie--both the story line as well as the animation. Characters are well developed and mostly (with one notable exception) likeable...especially the dog! Lots of life lessons included, par for Disney. A great way to spend a day or night (or both for all the discs!). Amazon has a GREAT PRICE on this set, better by far than any local stores. Combined with the awesome shipping and customer service, you cannot go wrong purchasing this Up set!

7569149,5,B019A3QMJA,"Never being a big fan of Disney films, with the rare exceptions of only a handful of movies, the film ""Up"" had always gone underneath my radar.  That is until recently while browsing through channels on my television when I encountered the film rolling its opening credits.  I decided to watch the film, and I must admit, I was completely surprised by what the film had to offer to its viewing audience.

The general story of the movie is actually a rather depressing one.  Revolving around an old man by the name of Carl Fredricksen, it begins by depicting the man's childhood.  As a child, Carl was obsessed with exploration, planes, discoveries, and an explorer by the name of Charles Muntz.  He meets a little girl by the name of Ellie, who is basically a female version of Carl.  Like Carl, she has an obsession with exploration and the greatly renowned explorer Charles Muntz.  The two of them make a vow to one day venture to Paradise Falls in South America, the location where their hero Muntz discovered the skeleton of a new species of exotic bird.

Years go by, and eventually Carl and Ellie get married.  As time progresses, complications in their lives (such as a miscarriage of their only child) prevent them from ever going to Paradise Falls despite the promise that they made to one another.  Until the one day when Carl decides to purchase flight tickets to South America in order to fulfill his promise to his aging wife.  The two never make it though, seeing how Ellie dies that very same day, leaving Carl alone.

One day, Carl meets a Wilderness Explorer by the name of Russell, who wishes to receive his ""Assisting the Elderly Badge"", and asks Carl if there's anything he can do to help him.  After convincing Russell to leave, Carl gets evicted from his home after assaulting a construction worker.  In order to avoid giving up his home, Carl turns his house into a giant hot air balloon, by utilizing thousands of balloons that are tied to the roof.  He begins his journey to Paradise Falls, in order to fulfill his promise to his now deceased wife.

What Carl didn't know was that Russell had stowed away on the flying home, and now the two are stuck working together through their adventures in South America.  The two begin to bound, as they fight for their lives and meet new friends, such as Doug the talking dog, and Kevin the giant blue bird.  The story depicts the problems that arise as the group begins to see things turn for the worse with each passing minute.  They all learn to put their differences aside.

The film provides great sequences of laugh inducing jokes, many of which come from the group of talking dogs (Doug the Golden Retriever, and Alpha the Doberman Pinscher).  There's plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy and the story touches the audience on several levels.  ""Up"" is a movie that provides such a wide range of emotions that it's sure to please any member of the family, from the young to the young at heart, there's sure to be something in the movie for everyone.  Portions of the film can be cute, others can be funny, while others can be quite sad.

The animation is stupendous, and every actor did a great job providing voice-overs for every character.  The plot is original, and the viewers never truly know what is going to happen next.  Overall, Disney did an excellent job providing a child friendly film that can be enjoyed by adults as well.  ""Up"" is definitely a film worth checking out.",1293753600,4,3457,4.604575163398692

The movie is great, I love it, I think Pixar is great in making heart-touching movies with good family values, but this review isn't about the movie, is about the DVD disc. I'm from Guatemala (Central America) my native language is Spanish, when you see the product's description it says, and I quote:

Language: English (DTS 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)
Subtitles: French, Spanish

So I was expecting that the DVD will have Spanish subtitles as well, but it doesn't, it only has English for the hearing impaired, my blu-ray player doesn't work and I planned to watch the DVD movie while I fix it but now I can't. Today as I was writting this review I saw a review that said there was no Spanish subtitles in the DVD, I didn't saw it earlier but still Amazon should have a separated product description for every disc, after all who has the time to look for a detailed comment to see exactly how the product is?

7569160,4,B019A3QMJA,"Perhaps I should begin this review with some interesting facts about 2009's Up before even beginning to break down the nuts, bolts and personal opinions of the film.  Up represents director Pete Docter's first Pixar project since 2001's Monsters Inc, it was Pixar's first ever 3D film, it was the first Disney collaboration to earn a PG rating since Pixar's The Incredibles, it features Pixar's first Japanese/Asian-American character, it was the first Disney/Pixar film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (only the second animated film ever to do that), and until Toy Story 3, it earned notoriety as the second most commercially successful Pixar work (behind Finding Nemo).  Now that's quite a bit of distinction!

So what's with all the hype you ask? I can't be positive but in my opinion it is the least Pixar-like of all of the Pixar films.  How so? Well I typically associate the company with plot concepts so overly clever that they would be charming even if every other aspect of the film bombed (which has, to date, never happened in case you're wondering).

Up is, well, different.  It starts out by recapping a very-human couple's lifespan then transforms into a fairly straightforward adventure story.  No monsters here, no robots, living toys, and even the talking animals are explained scientifically!

Up is a comedy adventure about a 78-year-old widower and retired balloon salesman named Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), who finally fulfills a rather unorthodox lifelong dream of great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and sails toward the wilds of South America.  It is this flying house gimmick that will forever stick in the collective minds of the public (and inspired the film's title) but beyond the superficial there lies a pretty charming tale of the human condition that harkens back to vintage Disney in their 2D prime.

Up opens by telling Carl's story with extraordinary tenderness and a sense of pacing that hints of a brisk, consistent emotionally charged story. However, the balloon driven air-abode represents the introduction to the second half of the film, which essentially transforms our gray-haired heart string tugger into a bit of a geriatric action hero; a sort of Indiana Jones' great grandfather if you will.

Fortunately this is Pixar here people, and any doubts of pointless exposition are offset by the unique dynamic established when Carl finds himself an unintentional guardian of a boisterous young scout precisely 70-years his junior.

This young Wilderness Explorer (think boy scouts without the legal snares for rights), Russell (Jordan Nagai), provides some wonderfully humorous moments that act as the perfect catalyst to bring out the comedic best from the ever-grumpy Carl.

The visuals, which as is par for the course with the companies involved, are appropriately awesome with photo-realistic texturing, mind-boggling lighting effects, and characters positively charged with personality.

The score comes from none other than living legend Michael Giacchino (no stranger to Pixar's scoring demands, having worked with them on The Incredibles & Ratatouille).  It is appropriately epic when need be and charmingly intimate when the film's proverbial heart calls for it.

In all Up provides a very charming emotionally laced 96-minute joyride that manages to pack a whole lot of charm into what really boils down to a fairly straightforward adventure piece.  Like all of Pixar's works, it succeeds in providing something appealing to viewers from any conceivable age groups and does so with an effortlessness that hints to the reality that Pixar could very well be the best place to work in the whole world.",1289692800,,3695,5.204047217537942

My son didn't seem interested in it, so I just popped it in when he wasn't looking and now he loves it!! We watch it often. Its totally relatable as many know a grumpy old man. But it shows great story behind why he is grumpy and how happy he once was to now becoming a sad old man. I absolutly love the Big bird and the talking dog- they almost make the movie to me. They are both fun to watch and are just plain adorable. I have so many lines that come to mind when I think of the movie that are cathy and funny! Everytime I see my dog jerk his head and look out the window I think ""SQUIRELL""!!! It is just plain cute and has a great message behind it.

7569164,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up is probably one of the funniest Pixar films, and I had to wipe my eyes frequently to clear the tears of laughter. There are three reasons why Up was supremely satisfying.

First, the movie is visually breathtaking. I watched the film in 3-d, which meant that I wore the goofy glasses. This was the first movie I have ever seen in 3-d, and it was awesome. I was like a little kid seeing a lightsaber fight for the first time. In addition to 3-d, the storyboards and animation was beautiful. Vibrant colors and exotic scenes dominated the screen, and I was completely absorbed in the art.

The second reason Up was a great movie was the humor in the movie. As I've already mentioned, the film was hilarious. Not just a few laughs, mind you, but whole-theatre laugh-out-loud-for-several-moments funny. The main two characters, grumpy old Mr. Fredricksen and young and clumsy Russell, are wonderfully dynamic with each other, each completing the others comedy. Plus, Kevin and Dug are hysterical.

Finally, Up succeeds because of the story. Like books, movies often fail if the story is weak. The writers for Up created a heart-wrenching but soul-laughing story, and the director knew where and when to stir each emotion. Mr. Fredricksen is a widower and Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer looking to earn a badge for his scout troop, and the two form an unlikely duo. The development of their relationship propels the plot with a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, this was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I'll even confess that not all of the tears that came to my eyes were from laughter. The film was fantastic, especially in 3-d, and I urge you all to go and watch it. Take your special someone, your kids, your friends, or your robot-nanny and watch it. Unless you have a heart of stone, I guarantee you'll feel your emotions tugged, too.",1288828800,3,1864,4.708588957055214
7569165,2,B019A3QMJA,"SPOILER ALERT

At the risk of committing heresy, I did not like this movie.

A child is inspired to dream by a man, who is a world-renowned explorer and zoologist.  The child's future wife is inspired by the same man; who is tangentially responsible for the two meeting.

The explorer is then accused of faking a discovery and vows to return with a living specimen or not at all.  The children remain inspired by him, however.

Life intrudes for the children who grow up, marry, grow old, and never have the chance go exploring on for themselves.  The wife eventually dies, and her husband is seemingly consigned to a life of no consequence to himself or any other.

He seizes one last chance for adventure, though, and through a series of events floats his house (and a young child) down to the location he and his wife always dreamed of.  It is still a remote jungle, full of adventure and excitement.

They discover a heretofore undiscovered species of bird, and it what should have been a powerfully emotional moment, they also find the disgraced explorer who originally inspired the now old man.  Instead, this even older man is full of hatred and bitterness for the world that rejected him oh those many years before.

And this is what I couldn't get past.  The inspiration behind an entire life is revealed to be an empty shell and nothing is ever as it seems.",1288742400,7,1367,4.599173553719008
7569166,5,B019A3QMJA,"Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.

This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.

Saying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.

The rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.

I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.

Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that ""Up"" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.",1288656000,8,3290,4.467554076539101

Obviously, I bought the DVD.",1286409600,,393,4.397260273972603
7569173,2,B019A3QMJA,"Up isn't actually my first Pixar disappointment. I didn't really like A Bug's Life or Cars, and in my opinion The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and WALL-E fell short of their potential. Up has really gotten a lot of attention though, absolutely adored by critics and constantly popping up in pop culture. I feel like if DreamWorks or Blue Sky Studios (who don't have such polished reputations) had made this film, it would be called ""fine but unremarkable"" or ""underwhelming"".

Up gets off to a promising start. After their childhood back-story is established, there is a long montage of the married life between Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie. It evoked real emotion, as I watched time pass in their world, it reminded of how ""time flies by"" in the real world, and a lot of the regret that comes with long-term procrastination, with distant dreams that you want to happen but secretly know won't.

Carl somehow lifts his house off the ground using balloons. It's required I guess, the lifting of the house is a huge part of Carl and his character. You need it for him to even get started on his journey. It even adds a layer of adventure, makes it *epic*. But then the movie feels the need to have an antagonist.

Charles Muntz is a poorly handled villain in a movie that didn't need one. He's spent years in South America looking for this cryptid bird, and he's become so afraid that someone will steal his glory that he's ready to kill. It's ridiculous think he wouldn't want to join up with other explorers and make his life easier. He may want all the credit, but to turn evil? He's rather vengeful toward to the bird, which seems to be outside the nature of this kind of character. He cares about his dogs, but not a bird that has pretty much dominated his life for years? How could he NOT have caught this thing by now? If he's never owned chocolate, how come Beta and Gamma could recognize its smell? Why doesn't he show the world his other amazing discoveries and become famous again? He could have been portrayed as a willing but broken old man who just wants to do something meaningful. He could even have symbolized what happens to a person when they can't admit to themselves that some dreams can't be realized.

Ed Asner was great as Carl, and Jordan Nagai was pretty good as Russell. Was I emotionally involved in their ""I don't have a son, and I don't have a dad"" relationship? No, I found it tired and sentimental.

Up is rather barren, you don't see much of anything. There's a bird, a zeppelin, dogs, and that's all. At one point Muntz mentions how he's lots so many dogs to the labyrinth. Suddenly I got really interested. ""Wow, a giant maze out here...that just sounds so cool!"" The labyrinth is sort of seen, but they don't actually go in or anything. The film's whimsy doesn't remedy this and works against it. One would expect a movie set in a jungle (or rather, a tepui) to be atmospheric, but talking dogs don't exactly allow that. They are unfunny and unwelcome. It gets too fantastical to really fit with the tone previously set up.

I was surprised that I didn't like Up very much, and at first I found it hard to admit to myself that I hadn't liked it. It doesn't work as a character study, nor as an adventure film.",1285977600,,3247,4.51360544217687

Now that Ellie is gone, Carl just wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, Russell, a local scout trying to earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, is pulled into the adventure too.

They head for Paradise Falls and end up battling the famous explorer Charles Muntz who is trying to capture a rare bird assisted by his band of dogs who can talk with the help of special collars.

The rewatch values of these movies are so high that it makes me want to collect them.  I literally mark on our calendars when their new movies are to come out.  I cannot wait for ""Toy Story 3"" DVD to be released.

7569187,5,B019A3QMJA,"I'm not sure if this is the best movie I've ever seen, but for the life of me I can't think of one better.  I'm not usually a watcher of Pixar stuff for some reason, indeed the last one I'd seen was the first Toy Story.  No good reason why that's so, I just never got around to them.  But something about the premise of Up grabbed me, so when I saw it in a used DVD bin, I snagged it.  Two watchings in two days later, and I ordered this particular Blu-Ray copy of it, after bragging about Up to anyone and everyone I came across.

What's great about it?  Where do I start?  First, there's the house made of balloons.  It makes for amazing cover art, and arouses curiousity.  Petty you think?  Not really, the eye likes what the eye likes, and that's not to be discounted.  The characters for another.  Carl Frederickson isn't some to good to be true hero or precocious kid, he's a crotchety old man who actually behaves like an old man.  Go figure eh?  He doesn't look much like voice talent Ed Asner, but Asner's voice is letter perfect for the performance.  His sidekick, Russell, voiced by Jordan Nagai, acts just like a little kid would act.  He's very observant at times, but naive and obtuse a lot of the time as well, just like a real life version of Russell would be.  The two of them make for a great team, even if Carl is a little slow to grasp that.  And that's what's terrific about the roles, neither of them know everything, or instantly figure out what to do.  They have to think, and the movie shows them thinking. Not a lot of movies have the patience, or the sense, to allow its characters to think.  But Up does.  The supporting characters, like Christopher Plummer's Charles Muntz, the dog Dug, and all the rest are excellently handled as well.

The highlight of the supporting characters, for me, was the young/old versions of Ellie Frederickson.  The young version is voiced by the director's daughter, and she has the right bit of spunk and adventure for the shy and callow Carl (they look to be about 8-10 years old in those scenes).  The adult version, who marries Carl, is done without a voice, and is part of the most touching montage I've ever seen on screen.  We watch 50 years of their lives in a few minutes, with no dialogue, yet it spoke volumes.  This is why the cliche ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is so relevant even today.  I think I've watched it five or six times and I still tear up during it.

The computer artistry is what one expects from Pixar, even someone like me who isn't a habitual watcher of their films.  The balloon house, the airship, the dogs (don't laugh, they're a riot), all of it was done with amazing technical proficiency, and always adds to the story.

But it really comes back to Carl and Russell in the end.  I cared about them, what happened to them, and more importantly what they took out of those adventures.  I've not heard anything about an Up sequel, and there's nothing on its Wikipedia page, but I would love to see another adventure with the two of them in it.  Either way, Pixar has made a fan out of me for a long time, I hope they can keep it up.

I was not thrilled with UP, but the odd, creative and totally unique moments make it worthwhile.

The beginning is long, slow and depressing... and I almost stopped watching.

The following elements won me over eventually:

an old, old man trudging endlessly through strange adventures in South America forest and mountains attached via a garden hose to his floating house, which is held aloft by helium balloons.

A huge troop of dogs wearing collars with translators that allow us to hear what they are saying. Funniest thing is the Alpha Dog is a doberman and his translator is broken and he sounds like a chipmunk.

Even though the dogs are wearing translators they are still dogs and they are constantly distracted by the thought of a squirrel running by.

7569193,5,B019A3QMJA,"This 2009 flick is Pixar's most imaginitive film to date.
 In the 1930s, a wide-eyed lad with glasses, flight goggles, and a helmet over them named Carl Fredericksen(Jeremy Leary)sits before a movie screen in a cinema full of equally awed viewers, watching a newsreel featuring his personal hero, aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz( Christopher Plummer)have his career chronicled in an episode ending with his discreditation over a discovery he claimed to have made. Muntz vows never to return from the jungles of South America until he can prove his discovery valid.
 Upon leaving the theatre, Carl's young life skips merrily along, until, to his great surprise, he meets the wild, red-haired Ellie(Elie Docter), with whom the staid and quiet young boy shares a passion for flight, and develops a desire to travel to Pardise Falls in South America, since Charles Muntz is her personal hero, as well.
 Eventually, they grow up, and marry to the delight of Ellie's boisterous backwoods family, and Carl's elegantly staid family.
 They go directly to their dream house, the old boarded-up cottage where they used to pretend they were exploring in a dirigible.
 Over the years, Carl is employed as a balloon vendor at a local zoo, where Ellie works as a guide. In their spare time, they picnic on a hill and describe what they see in the clouds.
 After learning that Ellie cannot have children, Carl brings her out of her depression by reminder her of her dream to visit South America, and they begin saving for it. Their dream is waylaid by unforseen expenses, and Life's calamities. Life continues, and they grow old together. Sadly Ellie passes away  before their dream can be fullfilled.
 Carl retired to the house he and Ellie shared. But things will not be quiet for very long.
  The city literally begins to spring up around the Frederickson's cottage. Danny Mann's construction worker, Steve, working on behalf of his foreman, Tom(John Ratzenberger), unsuccessfully tries for the umpteenth time to buy the property.
  At the same time, a Junior Wilderness explorer named Russell( Jordan Nagai), arrives at Carl's door, hoping to acquire his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge. Carl declines the offer, and diverts the boy.
 Legal trouble results in Carl's being committed to an assisted living home. Two male nurses(Donald Fullilove, and Jess Harrell) arrive to escort him to his new home.
 But guided by Ellie's spirit, he trumps them all by releasing a mountain of balloons tied to the roof of his house, which pull the house away from its moorings, to the astonishment of the nurses, of a little girl playing in her bedroom in her apartment  highrise, whose world is momentarily but gloriously bathed in an array of colors by the balloon's reflections, and by sundry townspeople.
 ""We're on our way, Ellie!"" Carl solemnly declares as he steers the flying wooden vessel, making his late wife's childhood imaginings a reality.
 He is given an unexpected companion  for the journey. Young Russell was caught on the porch when the voyage began, and while Carl is initially reluctant to let him in, the chatty lad is soon given a chance to earn his badge for assisting the elderly in a way he never expected.
 They reach South America with a thunderous jolt, and manage to tie themselves to the floating house as they explore the jungle.
 They encounter a rainbow colored flightless bird, whom Russell entices with chocolate and names ""Kevin"", and a mysterious dog with a talking collar named Dug (Bob Peterson). Once again, curmudgeonly Carl accepts the company of both, only reluctantly. But the companionship of both will be invaluable.
 The old man and the boy form a bond during their adventure. The widowered septegenarian learns why the young scout is in need of a father figure who will stand beside him when he receives his final badge.
 As they doggedly approach Paradise Falls, the spot where Ellie had dreamt of having a house, since childhood, they find themselves diverted by a pack of canines, who, like Dug, have collars enabling them to talk. The most notable of these are the Doberman, Alpha( also voiced by Bob Peterson), and Beta (Delroy Lindo), a bulldog, and another dog named Gamma(Jerome Ranft).
 The dogs'owner, as it turns out, is Charles Muntz, and Carl is delighted to meet his boyhood hero. But Carl and Russell realize Muntz's sinister designs on Kevin and must fight to save the bird. Despite Carl's initial refusal to get involved when Kevin is seized, Russell's derring-do forces him to act, ultimately giving the phrase, ""Spirit of Adventure"" a whole new meaning.
 In the end, we see how a lonely widower's life is renewed after loss, and how sorrow gives way to new adventures, new hope, and new joys, if we allow it.
 I would give this delightful fantasy the Ellie Badge.
 In the final analysis, ""Up"" is simply ""Up-lifting""!",1280102400,,4859,4.931288343558283

7569199,5,B019A3QMJA,"Movie - 5.0

Continuing to build on their hefty rsum of animated excellence, Pixar presents us with their next masterpiece in Up, a film that manages to further teach, amaze, and entertain audiences everywhere with its touching story, adventurous characters, and always-appreciated detail to attention and nuances. When I first saw this in theaters, I was bewildered in a lot of ways. This was the first Pixar movie I'd seen in theaters in a looong time, it was also my first 3D viewing, and it also reminded me of why I haven't tried watching said movies in a while (<-- noisy kids distracting me). But in buying the Blu-ray and having a chance to watch all the extras in the comfort of my own home, I dare say the movie left such a long-lasting, subconscious resonance, that I just about instantly remembered and picked up on so many of the wonderful themes addressed in the film's spectacular screenplay: age, dreams, preoccupation with life, feeling a sense of fulfillment, loneliness and separation, the hardships of death and the eventual resolve of letting the past go, companionship, and last but not least, the spirit of adventure(!). The movie itself succeeds on many levels, and a lot of that has to do with fine, fine voice acting from Ed Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and the various sound effects cues of Kevin via Tom Myers, the sound designer. The script thoroughly and deservedly reflects that innocence I mentioned and evokes something of an almost goofy, yet chummy quality throughout the film. Right from the get go of Muntz's opening film reel to the very end when Carl awards Russell the Ellie Badge are we captivated in such amorous ambiance. Literally, the movie is a wondrous adventure within itself. Up is a masterpiece. But in saying what I've already said, it's really just a matter of seeing and believing it for yourself. Certainly, everybody's interpretation or opinion on the film will vary, but here's hoping this writer's take will help some of you to see the great qualities that make this film so very, very enjoyable. Up is definitely one for the ages.

Video - 5.0

Presented by Disney/Buena Vista in glorious 1080p using AVC and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, it shouldn't be any surprise that Pixar-to-BD equals a perfect score. They're world-renowned for their art and animation as it is, so a direct digital transfer should be a no-brainer. The plethora of color schemes is fantastic. Vibrancy amongst the different locales, isolated locations, and various environments/characters are perfect. Edges are as straight and smooth as a computer can make them. Contrast and black levels have zero discrepancy, and there's not a single sign of aliasing, saturation, banding, EE, DNR, artifacts, noise, or bad editing. The transfer is flawless and worthy of CG demonstration to your guests.

Audio - 5.0

As with most Pixar/Disney movies, a lot of the sound relies on dialogue and music, with environmental and incidental sound effects on the side. With that said, Up's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track is as crisp and clean as the video. Dialogue is crystal clear with directionality and effortless noise distribution across the front stage. Separation between voices and the uplifting score by Michael Giacchino is also spot on. Surrounds are subtle at first until Carl actually gets his house up and flying into the air. The creaking of the house and inflation of the balloons are great and all, but I'd say the funner parts are during their trip into the storm and dog fight sequence towards the end. LFEs are especially prominent when that thunderstorm starts thundering. It's so scary and ominous, yet so cool and sexy for audiophiles. This is yet another outstanding audio effort from Pixar Studios to demo your systems with.

Extras - 4.0

Yes, as spectacular as the movie and A/V specs are, the Extras, while cool in their all-HD-ness, only get a 4 from me. The Cine-Explore takes commentary beyond commentary with it's innovative P-i-P approach using storyboards, CG composites, etc. to give audiences a more in-depth look at the film's construction. It's really cool, and I really appreciate Pete Docter and Bob Peterson's insight. I also really enjoy the Pixar shorts and idea of an interactive game. But only 48 minutes of production documentaries? I expected a little more than that. What about interviews with Asner and Nagai or Tim Myers and the rest of the sound crew? The documentaries, while extremely intriguing and informational, feel a bit too short, in my opinion, and very truncated in terms of the scope they could've achieved. Ah, well. Kudos to the production and art staff for their efforts anyway.

Overall - 5.0

Movie, Video, and Audio are on a level of excellence I think we've all come to expect from Pixar and Disney/Buena Vista these days. While the Extras leave just tad more to be desired, I can't see any reason in the Milky Way why I wouldn't recommend this intriguing work of art known as Up. It's a heartwarming, uplifting, and fun-for-the-whole-audience-adventure movie that will have you crying, laughing, and cheering all sorts of things.",1277164800,2,5105,4.940559440559441
7569200,4,B019A3QMJA,"A very outstanding film featuring an unlikely hero who is old and offers us many lessons about love, life, loss and heroes having clay feet. Some of the best movies in the film industry are being made by Pixar. In my opinion the first fifteen minutes of his life were fantastic and actually brought a lump to my throat such was the power of this animated movie. Some of the scenes other than the first fifteen minutes stay with you, such as the house's final resting place after the balloons have snapped- simply superb. Ed Asner who simply is Carl Fredricksen, Jordan Nagai as Russell and Christopher Plummer nailing the role of Charles Muntz. Four stars 6/18/10",1276992000,,663,4.6752136752136755
7569201,5,B019A3QMJA,"Time and time again, Pixar has showcased to the world their ever-growing and nearly limitless talents to the world of animated filmmaking. From Toy Story to Finding Nemo, from Monsters Inc. to Wall-E, their craft and skill has expanded and deepened, and their stories have been sealed within a generation. With their newest film Up, I believe that they have once again reached new heights (pun intended).

Directed by the masterful Pete Docter, who previously wrote Wall-E, Toy Story, and who wrote and directed Monster's Inc, Up opens with the meeting of two young children named Carl and Ellie, who both want to be explorers one day. The film then transitions to what is by far the finest sequence Pixar has ever shot, showing us how these two destined souls fall in love and marry, move into their dream house, and experience hope, hardship, tragedy, and death. The opening is startlingly moving and poetic, which is due in large part it being silent, aside from a beautiful and heartbreaking score by Michael Giacchino. It is the most daring and ambitious depiction of marriage and life that I've ever seen in an animated movie.

There is a flash forward, and Carl Frederickson (voiced by Ed Asner), who is now a widower, has become a cranky, impatient, and cynical old man. He has been stricken by loss and disappointment to such a great extent that on a good day, he will leave the house only to get as far as his own front porch, where he sits and watches the city he lives in grow and expand without him.

After a government agency, headed by a man wearing a suit, sunglasses, and a cell phone, threatens to take Carl's house away from him and put him in a ""retirement community,"" Carl decides to finally escape. He isn't going to let anyone take Ellie's dream house away, so he ties hundreds and hundreds of helium balloons to it and sets afloat toward the legendary Paradise Falls, the place where he and Ellie's beloved hero, explorer Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer), went missing decades earlier after finding the bones of a lost creature and being accused of being a fake. This is also where Ellie and Carl always dreamed of going, and Carl now seeks to fulfill that dream for her.

Carl is joined on his journey by a Wilderness Explorer Scout named Russell, who is one of the finest child characters I have ever seen, mostly because, although he annoys Carl like he is supposed to, he never became tiresome to me. That is a rare thing.

The action sequences that follow when Carl reaches his destination are quite entertaining, and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film. Pixar's films are always very good at tickling the funny bones of both adults and children alike, and this is certainly no exception. There are dogs with faulty voice enhancing collars, a giant colorful bird-creature named Kevin who loves chocolate, and of course, Charles Muntz's beautifully crafted airship. The look of the film is dazzling, particularly the brilliant flock of balloons that carries the house across the sky. The use of color here is sublime.

My girlfriend of nearly four years, Courtney, recently lost her grandmother, to whom she was very close. Her grandfather took his grandson to see Up shortly after his wife of 40 years passed away. After watching it, he called Courtney to tell her what a tremendous affect it had on him. He said that he cried many times throughout the film, and that afterwards, he felt uplifted and comforted by its message. I myself nearly fell into tears after hearing that, and the movie means more to me for it having helped him as it did.",1276905600,,3608,4.709984152139461
7569202,5,B019A3QMJA,"This was overall just an excellent movie. There is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie so I will just jump into a few of the things that I really liked about it. First, Doug and Kevin where so charming. Well, to be frank the entire movie is amazing charming in its own way, but Doug and Kevin especially. The movements of the bird are just amazing, and the things that the dogs say and do are exactly what you would expect a dog to do, they captured it perfectly. They were quirky and funny and loveable all at the same time, something that the guys over at Pixar are really good at.

The beginning of the movie was a bit more dark than I was expecting it be, but it set up the rest of the story so well. I felt like this was an animated movie, but really had a lot of meaning to just about anyone who watched it. There were some really hard-hitting moments, most in the early part of the movie, that really got the viewer emotionally attached to the characters. And I think that is important for the movie to work.

The only negative is that som of the events that occurred once they landed were a bit predictable. But it was still a fun ride the whole way through. None of this movie felt like filler or boring for even a second from the opening to the credits. The whole adventure feeling of the movie was exciting and engaging. And the progression of Mr. Fredricksen throughout the movie was heart-warming and satisfying.

Overall, this is just an amazing movie, and unquestionably my favorite animated movie I have ever seen.",1276819200,4,1547,4.346020761245675

7569209,5,B019A3QMJA,"Like a lot of people, I was skeptical when I first heard about the story for Up. An old guy taking his house to South America, via balloons, because his wife wanted to go there before she died? It didn't sound dumb by any means, just kinda weird. Then I realized how weird the stories for WALL-E, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille and a few others sounded, and I knew I'd be seeing it no matter what. I may not like everything Pixar's done, but they have a good track record, and just like with WALL-E, they knocked another one outta the park with Up. If you ask me, I think this movie has the most heart of all Pixar's films, and that's pretty hard to do given the amount of heart that most of them have.

Up is the story of Carl Fredricksen, a balloon salesman who lives alone in an old fashioned house now in the middle of a construction site. He runs into a little trouble one day when he's encouraged to sell his house, and takes off with thousands of balloons tied to it. He wants to go to Paradise Falls, a beautiful location in South America that he and his now deceased wife were going to go, but things keep preventing them from taking the trip when they were younger. Everything seems to be going to plan at first, but Carl soon discovers that he's not alone. Russell, a boyscout, was on the porch when the house took off, and is now along for the ride. The two make it to South America, and try to make it to Paradise Falls, but discover a rare bird, 'talking' dogs, and someone that Carl used to admire when he was younger. What's in store for these guys is the definition of adventure.

Personally, eventhough kids obviously loved this film, I think Up is a little more for adults than children, kind of like how The Incredibles was. The theme of an old man trying to fulfill a promise made to his dead wife is pretty emotional, and seeing the couple grow old in a montage is sure to tug at anyone's heart strings. The cast of characters here is great, and since the cast is fairly small, everyone gets their share of time. Russell and Dug steal every scene they're in, and the humor is typical Pixar, with a lot of little jokes that anyone can enjoy. Having a boyscout out in the middle of a South American jungle is pretty hilarious on its own when you think about it. I can honestly say that this is one of the few movies in the last couple of years that I enjoyed every minute of. I was never bored, and didn't want the movie to end. The final scene did bring a tear to my eye, not because I found it sad, but because of how beautiful it was. Up deserved every bit of that Best Picture award nomination it got, and it's a shame that it didn't win it.

Simply put, the picture and audio quality for the blu-ray are perfect. There's NOTHING bad I can say about either, though it might've been even better if there were a 7.1 track in addition to the 5.1 DTS-HD Master. Either way, if you're looking for an animated movie, or any movie at all, to show off your home theater system, Up is sure to impress.

And just like the audio/visual quality, the extras are great too. First you get the dvd and digital copy, and both are good to have since you can have one in the car and the other on your computer or portable media player, then keep the blu-ray for home. Disc one, the blu-ray disc, has a good number of extras. Partly Cloudy is the short that played before the movie in theaters, and Dug's Special Mission is a brand new short where we get to see what Dug was doing before Carl and Russell meet him. There are also two featurettes about the animators going to South America for ideas for the scenery, and one involving the movie's antagonist and a kind of alternate ending with them. There's also an extensive commentary track that'll cover everything not given its own feature on either disc. Very informative, and I liked that they'd point out extra jokes that you might've missed. Disc 2 has even more, with featurettes for the four main characters (Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin), an extended montage scene of Carl and Ellie when they were younger and growing up (get ready to cry during this one), and more extras covering music, promos, trailers and much more. Basically, the only possible thing missing from this set is the 3D version of the movie, which I'm sure will come out on its own when 3D tvs start to sell better.

If you like Pixar, you'll get Up regardless of the reviews. It's definitely a worthy follow-up to WALL-E, which is to me, Pixar's best movie to date. This is definitely one for the whole family, or anyone who just wants to watch a great movie with an excellent story and memorable characters. For the movie itself, or the blu-ray, there's nothing bad I can say at all. This is one of those rare perfect sets.",1275955200,17,4753,4.335955056179776

I love that Pixar is brave enough to roll with such ingenious ideas that go completely against the norm when it comes to making children's films. ""Up"" is a great story that will touch the hearts of kids and adults alike. In fact, the first 10 minutes of the movie are so incredibly touching and heartbreaking that they left me, a 30-year-old woman, literally in tears.

Greydanus, which first appeared in the National Catholic Register, Up is ""a love story. A tragedy. A soaring fantasy, and a surreal animated comedy. A three-hankie weepie and a cliffhanging thriller. A cross-generational odd-couple buddy movie; a story of man and dog. A tale of sharply observed melancholy truths and whimsically unfettered nonsense....Up opens with an eloquent, economical prologue that is among the most arresting tributes to lifelong love that I have ever seen in any film, let alone a cartoon....Up is a film about life that makes realities of adult and even geriatric experience universally accessible, even to the youngest viewers.

I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, ""Just how is this a kid's movie?""  The plot was just too grown-up.  Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children.  It was uncomfortable.

Don't get me wrong.  The introduction was engrossing.  The animation was great.  Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin.  But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.

For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them.  And I truly love Pixar.  But this film just didn't sit right with me.  The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids.  Very confusing.

However, at the end of the day it's their warm, heartfelt stories that truly resonate with people.  And these aren't just stories for children.  These are stories for young and old alike.  These are stories for the child in us all.

Up is no acceptation.  Once again Pixar knocks it out of the park with this charming, touching family tale.  My son, wife, and I absolutely love this movie, their best to date in my opinion.

If you have a Blu-ray player, you owe it to yourself to buy this edition.  The picture is beyond amazing.  We are talking reference quality here.  If you don't have a Blu-ray player, do yourself a favor, buy one now and watch this film.  You can thank me later.

Those who refuse to watch animated films because they feel they are cartoons aimed solely at children are missing the boat.  I challenge you to watch the first 10 minutes.  If you're not truly moved and completely drawn into the story, call a doctor because something is wrong with you.

Although the Title ""Up"" left me clueless I borrowed her copy to watch and figure out why they named it ""Up"". When I was a small girl (which was nearly a 100 years ago) the theme for movies like Disney made were pretty standard old childhood stories filmed like cartoons and later animated.  However, ""Up"" with all of its lively characters was delightful to watch as they all took on their original roles and played them out to perfection.  The sound, color, story and animation drew me into the film very easily and kept me there.  What was interesting also. was the fact that this story was more true to life then most.  Stuff happened, danger was present, competition was obvious, strong emotions, and goals (good and not so good) were ever present driving the characters foward. And in the end each character came away with many lessons learned. I have seen this movie twice now and plan on seeing it again soon. What was my favorite lines in this movie?

---------------

Have you ever wondered how many balloons it takes to lift a real house?  Over 20 million!  Carl Fredrickson, a widowed 78-year-old curmudgeon and main hero in the uplifting Pixar 3-D movie ""Up"", has the curiosity and courage to try it!

While heading toward his dream home in his floating house to the remote ""Paradise Falls"", the lost world in South America that he and his deceased wife Ellie always wanted to go, Carl finds an unwitting stowaway on his front porch: a chubby 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell.

Together, Carl and Russell explored the forest with their newly-discovered exotic friend that Russell named ""Kevin.""  Soon, they discovered that the faded hero and nature explorer Charles Muntz has been chasing Kevin for over 50 years at Paradise Falls.  To save Kevin, Carl and Russell must go through an unimaginable adventure that changes their lives forever.

When I asked Pete Docter, the tall and ""animated"" director, why he chose balloons to float the house instead of seagulls (or other flying devices), he responded, ""There is something very magical and poetic about the balloon for me as a child.  When I let go of it, I'm not getting it back.  It is a bit like Carl's relationship with his wife Ellie."" Jonas Rivera, ""Up"" producer added, ""And balloons are much more colorful than seagulls too!""

My favorite character is Russell because I always want to be an explorer myself.  I love exploring the Torrey Pines State Reserve and Carmel Creek which inspire me to write poems.

I love the dazzling actions, amazing visual effects, and the beautiful music.  ""Up"" is about escape, friendship, and connections.  My favorite scene is the last scene.  After their long and arduous quest to explore nature's wonders, Carl and Russell each found someone to love.

7569254,5,B019A3QMJA,"This package includes a BLU-RAY Disk, a DVD and a disk to allow you to download it to your computer or smartphone or IPOD which is nice depending on what technology you have laying around the house.  The movie itself is a great family movie.  It was wonderfully done.  It deals with love, the grieving process, what is the nature of a family and has lots of adventure and action scenes with enough comic relief to break up the tension when it gets to stressful.  One hint to look for is that the movie is divided into four sections.  Section 1 is introducing the main character and has dialog and seems to be set in the 1930's and shows few months of the main character's life as a child.  Section 2 is done silent movie style and zoom through about six decades of the main character's life.  Section 3 is probably what most folks think as the ""movie"" and does take up most of the running time even though it actually occurs over the space of probably less than a week's worth of the main character life. Section 4 is a little sneaky as it is contained in the credit section and shows a series of family snapshots along side the credits and lets you know what happened after the ""movie"" ended.  The animation is wonderful. The story is fun.  You really wonder sometimes why kids movies do not win oscars for best picture after watching a movie like this.  It certainly was better done and much deeper, more thought provoking than most of the movies nominated for best picture and maybe better than some of the movies that won best picture.  But I guess UP is just a little too much of a ""kids"" movie to be taken seriously by the Hollywood elite.  Oh well.",1270684800,,1655,4.372549019607843
7569255,5,B019A3QMJA,"What an inspiring and yet, another genuinely enjoyable feature film from the artists at Disney & Pixar studios. I went into this having high hopes as I'm a massive fan of all Disney/Pixar collaborations with the exception of Wall-E which I simply did not enjoy for reasons I honestly cannot explain. I have to say my expectations were not only met, but surpassed. This not only warmed the heart but tickled me to the point I was in genuine tears of laughter. These types of films have developed a way of telling a story through the art of pictures; there is no need for words but music and moving images can tell just as much of a story than an entire script could. Even though I didn't enjoy Wall-E, this is something that I will praise it for. The makers have developed a way of telling a story without needing to explain it to you through dialogue. Well paced and well depicted animation is all you need to really tell a story and this is why I appreciated this that little bit more.

The movie tells the story of Carl Fredricksen an elderly man who, as a child, idolised explorer, Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz, while Carl was a young boy was discredited as a fraud by claiming to have discovered the bones of a giant bird which he found at Paradise Falls in South America. Determined to prove himself, Charles vows to not return until he has brought back a living specimen of the bird. Meanwhile, Carl meets Ellie, a feisty young girl with the same explorative dreams as Carl and they become fast friends. Then begins the silent homage to their life as it shows them becoming married and living their lives together still as in love as the day they first fell for one another. Sadly, Ellie, in her old age passes away and Carl is left alone in the home they bought and decorated together and around the home skyscrapers are being built with Carl being constantly pressured to sell his home to the company building the skyscrapers. After a series of more annoying events, Carl decides he's had enough and wants to go on that adventure to Paradise Falls him and Ellie always wanted to go on. But instead of just jumping on a plane, he fills his house with balloons and decides to fly there and take his house with him.

After the initial launch of the house, there is a lot more to the story as we are gradually introduced to Russell, a wilderness explorer aiming to achieve his ""help the elderly"" badge so he can become a senior Wilderness Explorer and in order to do this he is determined to help Carl with anything he needs help with. Then, when they make it to the wilderness we meet Kevin the giant bird and a talking dog named Dug. These are characters, although extremely different from one another, blend well together and actually make for a heart warming good guy ensemble cast. Some of the contents of the film are actually quite clich. The grumpy old man who's grumpy because he never accomplished his dream and the young boy who has all the ambition in the world and just wants to impress his family. These are character traits indicative of the Disney genre, although that is no bad thing. The setting, although at times filled with vibrant colours, is actually quite bland and unimaginative, though that doesn't take anything away from the animation which, as you'd expect from a Pixar movie, is superb.

The comedy, again as you would expect, is very witty and at times unusual but always funny. The bizarre traits of the animal characters dragged along for the ride are both genuine and hysterical, such as the typical dog traits for Dug, but fitted with a human voice amplifies those traits to a comically terrific level. The voice acting of all involved is, again spot on. Although not voiced by major names, the voices fit the characters well; from the loveable old man Carl voiced by Edward Asner, to the adorable Russell voiced by the young talent new on the scene, Jordan Nagai. One of the voices, I wish to point out for personal reasons really took me by surprise as I only realised who this man really was through simply browsing Wikipedia, and I was overjoyed to discover who this man was. Christopher Plummer was the voice of Carl's hero, Charles Muntz. Now the name may not ring any bells with most modern film fans, but to those fans of the old movies, especially fans of musical, The Sound of Music you will recognise this man as Captain Von Trapp himself. That's a little nerdy joy for me, so I hope you'll forgive me for getting a little carried away.

Overall, there's nothing bad I can say about this film. It's got originality to it that you see all the time with the Pixar outings, yet it keeps to the same old formula Disney has made famous since its creation, yet the mixing styles never get boring. Sure, to some the formulaic layout of the Disney movies may get a tad tedious, and they have even grated on me from time to time, but I adore the Disney/Pixar collaborations simply because they're fun and remind me of the simpler time when I was a kid. This is another strong outing from the team and I would strongly recommend it to all film fans of all ages, as there's something there for everyone.",1270684800,2,5142,4.513948497854077

The pricing of digital copies should be less, significantly less than the hard copy. And there is no way in hell that the itunes price should be MORE than the Amazon price for BD/DVD/Digital! At $17.99, Amazon is facilitating purchasing of this at all. The movie companies need to be realistic in their prices if they want to discourage people from copying DVDs, ie. stealing them. The Amazon price seems more than fair. Bottom line is that if customers pay $19.99 for digital copies, then the price will stay the same. I hope movie execs read this.

7569267,5,B019A3QMJA,"I was surprised to find that this film goes beyond animation in its design execution and even its visuals.

We see Carl Frederickson (voice of Edward Asner) spending his life planning a great adventure. His boyhood girlfriend Ellie shares his dream, they grow old together, and many local adventures drain the big adventure funds of money and time. Soon Carl finds he is alone in an alien world and makes an effort to fulfill his and his late wife's dream.

The story gets a little more complicated as he finds an unexpected stowaway and new friends. Soon he is forced to realize what is important in life and finds that he has already fulfilled, Ellie's new adventures by living  a lifetime together.

There is so much depth of thought and dimension of story that you could forget it is animated.

I only saw the Blu-ray version and there are more than enough extras and adjustments you can make. Luckily, you can ignore all this extra stuff and just play the movie if you like

If you haven't seen it, it's a very grown up movie which kids absolutely adore. My daughter loves the action scenes.
Truly amazing, I had very little expectation after being disappointed by Wall E and teaser trailer looked so infantile, but man was I wrong. I am so glad they made the combo pack affordable so we could have blu-ray at our house and dvd and grandparents.

also on a side note, studies show for younger kids anyway, better to watch same thing over and over than variety, as they anticipate what's coming and they learn phrases etc.. I can't think of a better movie to emulate and learn from.",1269561600,,714,4.5271317829457365
7569271,5,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is definitely one of Pixar's greatest films to date.  As with all Pixar films, ""Up"" has so much depth and such strong characterization that it can be enjoyed by both children and their parents.  This is one of 2009's best films.

The first two discs of this  four-disc set are Blu-Ray.  Disc 1 presents the movie, and picture and sound quality is top notch.  Also included are two short films, including ""Partly Cloudy"" (a brilliant short which was shown in front of ""Up"" in theaters).  Disc 2 contains bonus material, including multiple documentaries about the creation of the film.  Disc 3 is the DVD version of the movie.  Disc 4 is the Disney File Digital Copy, so you can download the film to either iTunes or Windows Media, and watch the film on a portable device.

Overall, ""Up"" is a great movie with a high-quality blu-ray release.",1269475200,2,844,4.641891891891892

7569274,5,B019A3QMJA,"NOTE:  This review was posted to the 4-disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo version of ""Up"".  If you are reading this with a different version, be aware that Amazon does this from time to time and reviewers have no control over it.

""Up"" is an enjoyable film that proves once again that Disney/Pixar can take an oddball story and make it entertaining, heartwarming, and endearing all at once.  The events are a childlike fantasy, with only a few dark edges around them.  The action, while fast-paced, is never too scary for little ones, and the laughs are many.  There is some intensity to ""Up"", with death bracketing the beginning and end of the film, but the tale told in between makes this easier to take.  Each of the characters has some depth to them, and we learn enough about them in the story to truly care and be drawn in.

The Four-Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo + BD-Live version of ""Up"" is crammed from end to end with just about anything you could imagine wanting from the home video experience.  In this decently-priced collection we have a Blu-Ray disc of the movie, complete with optional online-accessible content; a DVD edition of the film, the ""Extras"" disc with ""making of"", ""bonus materials"", short films and more, all of it representing an amazing Disney/Pixar production.  I was pretty impressed with all the featurettes that explained where most of the story's ideas came from and how they were researched.  The Blu-Ray is bright, colorful, and detailed, with textures being probably the most noticeable effect.  The DVD scales quite nicely, still managing to render well on a player with upscaling.  Extra features include stuff for the grown-ups, such as an explanation of why the story ended the way it did and some alternate ideas that the writers explored.  Last, the BD-Live content changes periodically, and can be accessed through a computer or through a Blu-Ray player that is Internet-enabled (such as the Playstation 3 I used to watch this collection).

If you missed ""Up"" in the theaters, you'll find this to be just as charming and fun as Disney/Pixar's previous offerings.  If you saw it in theaters and want to own ""Up"" at home, I have to say that this Blu-Ray looks just as good to me as it did in the theater, with the added bonus of a DVD (for compatibility) and extra goodies to enhance enjoyment of the film across the board.",1269388800,3,2347,4.758024691358025

7569276,4,B019A3QMJA,"While this movie had a few moments that upset the youngest grandchild... when the dogs got really nasty.... it was really enjoyed by the whole family.

7569277,5,B019A3QMJA,"Though it was a long time coming, in the case of ""Up"" it's almost a shame that the Academy created a separate category for feature length animated films.  In a word, it was one of the best films of 2009, period.  Aside from terrific visuals and a great story this film makes cogent observations about aging and loneliness as well as the value of friendship.  My parents, in their seventies now, loaned this movie to me.  They bought it after taking the grandkids to see it.  I conclude this review by saying, ""Thanks, Mom and Dad!"".",1269129600,,532,4.5
7569278,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up is uplifting in more ways than one. It's the adventure of an old man (Carl) fulfilling his wife's dream and a cub scout (Russell) accidentally caught up in the adventure and forming a bond with the old man. The movie is moving, charming, funny and always enjoyable - no dull spots at all. The beginning is an exposition of Carl's life with his wife (Ellie) who he meets as a pre-teen and marries; they have dreams of adventure that gradually fade as life takes over. As is true on almost all films by Pixar this background story is moving and brilliantly done. If the rest of the film wasn't so much fun the introduction of the pre-teens 'til Ellie's death would have been the deserved highlight. But the story takes off when the old man attaches a huge numbers of balloons to his house and flies away! Our cub scout friend happens to be on the porch at liftoff. Their goal is a waterfall in South America where a famous explorer (Charles Muntz) was last seen. The first big surprise is Doug, a dog who wears a collar that allows him to talk in several languages. Doug is very funny, but it turns out he is only one of many dogs with the collars. A strange and wondrous bird, sort of a cross between an emu and a bird of paradise adopts them. Of course, this bird, Kevin, is what the missing explorer, Muntz, has been trying to capture for the many years he has been missing - which explains the talking dog collars. Not that anything in the film needs explaining. In an early sequence after meeting Doug, the dog is suddenly hilariously distracted when he thinks he sees a squirrel. This comic device is used to great effect in the film. In a scene where the menacing dogs have them trapped, our heroes point and shout 'squirrel!"" which sends them off in a tizzy. The final use of the joke is in a scene of real tension as the dogs piloting their airplanes (I told you nothing needs to be explained) attack Russell in the flying house and it looks like the trouble is unsolvable. The kid shouts ""Squirrel !"" and the dogs collide with each other attempting to find the squirrel. It is a great payoff for using the running gag. Another dog gag is the use of ""Fetch!' to escape. No need to tell you the ending except that the Kevin is a mother who goes back to her kids as soon as she heals from a dogbite. ""UP"" is as good an animated film as any I have seen - and I'm in my 70s and have seen them all starting with Bambi and every other Disney film. The humanity and humor in this film puts it high up on my list. Very high UP.

7569279,3,B019A3QMJA,"Well, I decided to see what all the hubbub was about this film, and I can honestly tell you it's not the Oscar masterpiece it is made out to be. Is it entertaining? Of course it is, but it is no ground breaking CG cartoon. It's easy to entertain children with some funny gags, but that's all you have in this film strung together with an over used theme seen in previous Pixar films. Its nothing terribly new and honestly I found the story itself realtively borring. I think that it could have been allot better without the annoying ADD chubby Asian kid Russell. I can see having the ""comic relief"" with the dim witted dog ""Doug"" and well, the rest is really just ""filler"" and ""fluff to make an hour+feature. How it beat out Coraline I'll never know? I am only left to guess that the Oscar Committee plays favorites when it comes to voting on ""best of"" films. Coraline was a far more impressive film just in its scope of pushing stop-motion animation further in its technical achievements and all that ""Up"" gives you is a flat Disney cartoon that is nothing near the entertainment caliber of Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. See it once, but I certainly wouldn't spend the over bloated Disney price to buy this DVD, it truly isn't worth it.",1268870400,4,1264,4.476190476190476
7569280,4,B019A3QMJA,"The first 10 minutes of this movie and the last 5 minutes of this movie are the most touching, romantic, and tear jerking moments in this film.  There's also some great metaphors sprinkled throughout the movie, too, especially about learning to let go of the past in order to appreciate the present.  I especially liked the scene where all his furniture comes flying out of his house and I took note of how the furniture landed on the ground.

It surprised me that a kid's movie would be so meaningful.  I'm sure the meaning will be lost on little kids, but they should still appreciate this movie given the imaginative aspect of it (a flying house, a talking dog) and will probably think the little boy and dog are funny.  And adults will be reaching for the tissue box.  So this is a movie I see both adults and kids liking.

The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars (that was a hard thing to do since I loved this movie so much) was because it was slow moving at parts and the whole villain with attack dogs didn't quite work for me for some reason.

In the case of ""Up,"" this is absolutely true, as the previews only show a few sight gags that would be funny and entertaining to young children.  That's where fantasy ends and the serious theme of this movie begins.  IMHO, ""Up"" IS NOT for children under 10 -12, as it deals with the human cycle of life, including aging, and the eventual sadness involving the death of one of the spouses, and lingering depression.
This is not Bugs Bunny, where a character is hurt, maimed or killed, only to revive in the next scene.  In other words, I would classify ""Up"" as almost a dark drama, especially if viewed through the eyes and limited experience of a very young child.
This is a VERY good movie, despite being a cartoon, for tweens through seniors.  I would even venture that it borders on being a ""chick flick"" because of its emotional aspects, yet should be just as appealing to most males.
Finally, I would say, don't rent/buy/borrow this if you are looking for a cartoon with non-stop laughter, you will be totally disappointed.  Choose Bugs, Wylie, Taz, or other cartoon features instead.",1267920000,,1125,4.714285714285714

7569305,5,B019A3QMJA,"The best picture of 2009 wasn't a movie about giant blue aliens with a plot stolen from DANCES WITH WOLVES.  Nor was the best picture of 2009 a low-budget film about a military bomb squad in Iraq.  Both of these movies are good movies. However, neither can compare to the elegance, beauty, and simplicity of UP.

Though there are other characters in the movie, UP is the story of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner).  The first fifteen minutes of the film touchingly tells the story of Carl's life.  He grew up wanting to experience adventure, married the girl of his dreams, and together they lived a very happy-though sometimes bittersweet-life. By the time the opening sequence has concluded, we already have an appreciation for Carl and a longing to have known even more about his deceased wife, Ellie.

Carl is old, but he's also determined.  Skyscrapers and strip malls surround the old house that he and Ellie so painstakingly restored and though the land developer has offered to pay Mr. Fredricksen handsomely for his home and property, he refuses to sell.  However, in the end, through a careless act on Carl's part and a huge wrangling of the judicial system by the developer, Carl is forced to sell his property and ordered to move.  But, good old Carl is stubborn and sets about turning his entire home into a giant airship through the use of thousands of helium-filled balloons.  When the men from the retirement home come to take him away, Carl leaves them behind as he flies up, up, and away.

Carl thinks he's alone as he begins his journey to see Paradise Falls in South America, the dream destination he and Ellie always wanted to go.  However, there's a stowaway aboard on the front porch, a Wilderness Scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) that Carl thought he had gotten rid of by sending on a snipe hunt.  Carl reluctantly agrees to take Russell with him, but on the condition that Russell will go home once they reach Paradise Falls.  But the journey to paradise is filled with all kinds of strange and even dangerous adventures: terrifying heights, thick vegetation, talking dogs, rare endangered birds, and an ancient explorer bent on capturing his prey no matter what the cost.

Unlike 2008's WALL-E, UP doesn't have an agenda.  Instead, it's a story about one man's redemption.  Carl is a good man who lived a good life, but the death of his beloved Ellie not only turned him crotchety, but caused him to lose his way.  It takes the unbridled honesty and passion of a child to get Carl back on track and face what he could become, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer).
Of course, if that's not enough for you, UP also features all kinds of comedy for all ages.  Kids will love Dug and the rest of the talking dogs.  Adults will appreciate the zingy one-liners Carl delivers.  There are also all kinds of allusions throughout the movie (e.g. the dogs in the airplanes repeat lines taken directly from STAR WARS).

UP has great characters, moving story, and witty dialog.  Simply stated, it's the best movie of 2009.

The regular DVD includes the shorts ""Partly Cloudy"" and ""Dug's Special Mission"". ""Partly Cloudy"" features a stork sent to deliver dangerous baby critters.  The stork longs to have a regular delivery like the other storks, but in the end realizes just how important his job is.  As a side note, in watching UP you can catch a glimpse of a few of the clouds from ""Partly Cloudy"".  ""Dug's Special Mission"" illustrates what happens to Dug immediately preceding his discovering of Carl and Russell in the Jungle.",1267401600,2,3539,4.740196078431373

However, I'm only giving it a 2 star rating because of the packaging.  My 8 year old Godson is hearing impaired.  He can't go to the movies because most don't provide earphones or closed captioning for the deaf/hearing impaired.  He had ""heard"" about ""Up"" from friends and wanted badly to see it, so I promised him a movie night when the DVD came out.  Unfortunately, when I went to the video store to rent it, I discovered that it came without subtitles or closed captioning.

7569309,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar has done it again. Up is possibly the best animated movie of the year and it could even be considered the best movie of the year, live action or animated. And Disney has once again produced an outstanding package, with a bonus DVD and Digital Copy. The blu-ray is simply mind-blowing, but Disney has taken care to produce a top-quality DVD and digital copy as well, within the constraints imposed by the two standard-def formats. The soundstage too is simply amazing, whichever version you choose to watch.
The story is original and takes the viewers on a rollercoaster (sorry, balloon) ride to a little known corner of the world. We can identify with the lead character, as we are all adventurous in our minds, but time and monetary constraints do not usually allow us to explore such regions of our world. There are plenty of thrills and spills on the way and perhaps no live action feature could do justice to a story of this nature. All the characters, man or animal, are lively. The dialogue is witty too. The supplements are good, though not exceptional. There are some moments which may be somewhat scary to very small children, so parents should watch it along with them.
This is not only a film for kids, it is a film for all ages. And I mean it also in the sense that it will stand the test of time, long after we are gone. The 3-D version will eventually find its way to homes via the new 3-D blu-ray standard, but until then this 2D release will do just fine. It will lift you up every time you view it - and you can view it many times. This movie is a `blind' purchase - you don't need to think twice before hitting the order button.

Okay, now the movie review: I am a long time fan of well done cartoons, either traditionally cell inked (or watercolored, as with ""Lilo & Stitch"") or computer generated, and for many years Disney and then Pixar have set the standard for animation quality.  ""Up"" succeeds where some recent CG cartoons like ""Cars"" have, in my opinion, failed, because good animation alone is not enough.  Not only is ""Up"" beautifully crafted, it has a strong and engaging storyline that, in typical Disney tradition, operates on two levels: one for the youngsters (the histerically funny bird, the dogs), and one for adults (the grieving widower).  Are there holes in the plot?  Of course there are: in a movie where a house is pulled off its foundation by helium-filled balloons, what do you expect?  It's a cartoon!
I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for some quality ""escape"" time, either in standard definition DVD or Blu-ray (which I treated myself to for the improved graphics).

Now I saw this movie on a plane, without my son.  My thought was this: I am tired of adults talking about how excellent pixar movies are.  And then I thought about adults talking about Harry Potter and Twilight, and how ... good they are.  Neither are that good, unless you haven't read Bram Stoker's Dracula or... well pick a book.  I can forgive teenagers and pre-teens for reading these books, I can't forgive adults who seem to pride themselves on their appreciation of movies that were meant for kids. There is no literary parallel.  Pixar is not to film what Watership Down is to literature.  No.  If you are an adult and Up resonates with you- then you are truly not grown UP. If you can appreciate it for your children that is different, but really - your kids don't need this. What I mean to say here is grow up.",1266883200,6,999,4.294117647058823

7569316,5,B019A3QMJA,"I'm always keen to see the Pixar films. For me (and my girlfriend), they are the pinnacle of 3D animation films. All people involved seem to understand that the animation side is secondary to character development and depth. Although I enjoy 3D animated films from other studios (Sony, Dreamworks etc), they always seem to fall into the typecast bucket. For example: token black guy/girl who says things like ""That's what I'm talking about"", or ""You can't touch this"" etc etc, whether they're a hippo, a zebra or a mammoth. Then there's the central annoying white guy/girl, who usually does something to annoy all his/her friends, and ends up redeeming his/her self. And at the end there's always the obligatory terrible dance tune like ""I like to move it move it"". Tiresome, obvious jokes, that do sometimes hit the mark and genuinely make me laugh, but more often than not reek of White Trash-inspired dumbness.
But Pixar has a way of avoiding all these cliches and pot holes, and instead bring stories filled with depth, true humour, sadness, and all ranges of visual and emotional splendour that leave you feeling great (and usually quite thoughtful!).

Way to go Pixar. You may be the only part of Disney that isn't out to exploit all children for their parents' money!",1266710400,,1274,4.870967741935484
7569317,4,B019A3QMJA,"Up / B001KVZ6G6

I wasn't sure I'd enjoy ""Up"" - the previews all seemed like a stereotypically Grumpy Old Man who comes to appreciate the life that he turned his back on through the Power of Friendship, or something equally wholesome and two-dimensional.

Of course, this is a good example of how previews just aren't everything. Our grumpy old man has a name, Carl, and it turns out he's not so grumpy after all - but he has suffered a terrible and heart-wrenching loss. Pixar is to be congratulated for managing, again, to really flesh out a character in scenes that involve little-to-no actual dialogue, and in such a surprisingly short time - after the first 15 minutes of the film, I can almost guarantee you will care more about Carl than you have for the protagonists of the last dozen films you've watched. (OK, mileage will vary there, but seriously, Pixar does a wonderfully direct and succinct job of making you care for Carl as a person.)

There's so much to like about ""Up"". There's such a strong theme here of journeying to capture what you ""lost"", even if what you're trying to capture is something you never actually had. His tag-along friend, Russell, is also searching for something he has lost-yet-never-had, as he hopes that by finishing his merit badges, he might somehow regain the love that he remembers having from his father. If that doesn't break your heart, then nothing will. And the comic relief, Dug the Dog, is actually funny and heart-warming as well.

To my surprise, I really, really enjoyed ""Up"". I'm not quite sure how to rate it, though - I'm very glad that I've seen it, but...I strangely don't feel the need to re-watch it, which is unusual for me. Maybe it's just that ""Up"" burns itself into your memory so indelibly, or maybe it's just because it's a real tear-jerker, and I hate to cry, but for whatever reason, I'd recommend this as a rental first, and not necessarily a buy. Not because the movie isn't wonderful - it is! - but because ""Up"" might leave such a strong impression on you that you might not *need* to see it again... at least not without a box of tissues nearby.

This takes the step of ripping the original DVD to back up my copy for personal use out of the equation, and I don't have to feel like I'm doing something illegal. (Backing up something you have paid for, and want to last, is only prudent) This review is twofold, in that I personally really enjoyed this film. Also I want to commend Amazon for resolving an issue, literally within a minute of my complaint. First: This film is both going to tug at your heart strings, as the depth of the film reaches into the universal inevitability that we all are going to die. That we all love someone who is going to pass, and that it is a painful process. It will bring tears to your eyes. At the same time, the promise of new, different, and rewarding relationships are possible throughout life, and that all we need do, is be open to them. What a wonderful, funny, entertaining, and fulfilling story. It's colorful animation will entertain the kids, and the underlying 'grown-up' content is there for Mom and Dad. You will not be disappointed. As for the second part of my review, this deals with the professional side of Amazon, and why this company continues to be the success that it is. I ordered this film as a gift for my wife, for Valentines day. I was remiss, and found I was looking for a gift way late in the process. However! Amazon, offering Saturday, (Next day in my case) delivery would get the gift to my home, with one day to spare. This service was of course at a premium. I'm a Prime Member, and feel the service is well worth it. So I paid the $6.99 to get the item here by Saturday. As you may have surmised already, it did not make it on time. I was disappointed with Amazon, who has served me so well, for better then 12 years. The package arrived, Tuesday the 16th. With Monday being a holiday, I could understand that it did not get here then. But it was still later then promised. I found the contact by email button within the 'My Order's' portion of my account, and sent an email to Amazon, explaining my situation. I kid you not, within One Minute, they sent an email back to me, indicating that I would be receiving a refund of the $6.99 I paid, back to my MasterCard. That's customer service. Thanks Amazon.

7569325,4,B019A3QMJA,"Up is a remarkable film. From its outrageous and exotic setting to the touching story between a boy Russell and a man, Carl, this movie is great for all ages. The story is not only kid friendly but portrays an important story for all to know. Dreams are great to have and in knowing this adults can have the same reaction to the film as younger children.

 It starts with a classic romance among two childhood sweethearts, Carl and Ellie, who both share the same desire to explore just as their role models have. Where they plan to go is a place called Paradise Falls, an escape from reality. Sad to say as the story unfolds Elle passes before their chance to explore is even brought up. Now many many years later, Carl is a clear example of the ""grumpy old man"" image. His new individual goal in life is to bring his house to Paradise Falls where he believes Ellie has meant for them to be. So his mission began, first with the numerous helium filled balloons lifting his house and guiding him on his way to Paradise Falls. Much to his knowledge this was a trip all to himself, little does he know, a Wilderness Explorer Scout named Russell ends up on his front porch when carl releases the balloons to start the adventure. Russell wants to finish his Wilderness training and in order to do that he needs an assist the elderly patch. To do this he is constantly asking to help with anything and annoys Carl very much. From that moment on it's a true adventure for the two of them on their way to Paradise Falls. Here they meet new creatures, talking dogs, a crazed explorer and finally the true bond of friendship is formed.

This Disney and Pixar movie was directed by Pete Docter. He has also directed Monsters, Inc, wrote toy story, and a co-writer for the film WALL-E. Knowing the reputation and past history with these mentioned films this director has a clear vision when comes to animation. Just like in the movie Finding Nemo, the colors throughout this film are spectacular. Such detail went into the presentation and it is clearly shown.

7569328,5,B019A3QMJA,"Well..My review title may seem a bit pretentious at first, but there is a reason for that.

Calling this a ""movie"" or ""kid flick"" just doesn't seem to cover the bases here. This is indeed a film in every sense of the word. Yes, it is a Pixar film, but it is far more than your average Disney fare and, to my mind, the best film Pixar has done to date.

I can't begin to express the pure and raw emotion this tale evokes. If you have ever loved and lost, or known the real joy/heartache of true love, this will move you in ways you will not expect. While there are plenty of prat falls and comedy to make this a joy to watch with the kiddies, the true heart of this story is told within the first ten minutes...and it does so with very few words. To me, the heart of this film lies within the story of Carl and Ellie Fredrickson. Bonded by youth and a love for an intrepid explorer, they found each other...Carl is the shy and timid kind, where Ellie is a seemingly endless fountain of energy and enthusiasm. It is a kind hearted exploration of the human condition...and it is profound in it's simplicity.

Enter Russell...Wilderness Explorer extraordinaire. He's the lad many of us were in our youth, wide eyed and naive enough to see the world as one big adventure. It's in his naivity, despite a broken home and uncaring father, that we fondly remember the rose-colored glasses of youth...and he embodies that time in our lives when it was all going to be okay.

Dug is the most accurate portrayal of a dog I have ever seen on screen...animated or not. He shows the unconditional love and loyalty that we all come to expect from a perfect canine companion. I have to give kudos to the animators here, because I could see every single (yet matted) hair on him with incredibly life-like precision. His expressions and over all painted (or pixelated) enthusiasm left me wanting to reach out to the screen and give him a great big hug and a Milk Bone.

The voices could not be more perfectly casted...Christopher Plummer as Charles Muntz is incredible and I had to store away my images of Baron Von Trapp. Ed Asner as Carl Fredrickson may seem type-casted as the crotchety fellow..but he does it with as much panache as he conquered the role of the lovable Lou Grant. Through all of the digital computer designs and colors..you see THE MAN. Beyond that..you see the person inside of us all.

I won't go into the story..as I am sure most have you have seen the film already. What I will say to those who have not, PLEASE see this film as it is my pick for the best that 2009 had to offer. I would even go so far as to say it is my personal pick as the most moving film of the decade. In a world as jaded and cynical as we live in now..this is 90 minutes of pure joy that will easily make you remember that, despite all the politics and ills of today, there truly is the capacity for warmth and love...even in a silly little ""kiddie flick"".",1266278400,,2936,4.329090909090909
7569329,5,B019A3QMJA,"I bought this 4-disc BLU RAY version of ""Up"" yesterday - Monday 15 Feb 2010 (its UK release date) and watched it last night with the kids.

I'll not bore you with its genius, its beautifully scripted storyline, its staggeringly real themes - but I will bore you with the PICTURE QUALITY - because it's simply off-the-charts astonishing.

We've got ""Monsters Inc."", ""Cars"" and ""Wall-E"" on Pixar BLU RAYs - but this takes the gong. To say it's beautiful to look at - is a wild understatement. If ever a film showed how good HI DEF can be, then ""Up"" is it. The man-hours that must have been put into this - the detail is gob-smacking.

The faint stubble increasing on Mr. Fredricksen's chin as the days go by (he wouldn't have shaved), the scuffing on the caps of his shoes, the fingerprint smears on his goggles as he watches the Munz footage as a child in a cinema, the dust particles in the beams of light as the young Carl wanders into an abandoned house on hearing a girl's voice (the love of his life, a young Ellie), the grown-up Ellie, her hair blowing gently in the wind (viewed from the back) as she sits in her chair having been given the awful news about...

I don't why it's all so touching, so funny or so charming - it just is.

Other brill things include Ed Azner's perfectly cast voice as the grumpy old man Carl, the constantly chattering and whining Russell, the 8-year old Wilderness Explorer boy scout who latches onto to him, his house and his dreams, Dug the soppy talking dog, Kevin the tall South American bird who mimics everything and races across the screen like a demented gangly Road Runner, Christopher Plumber's fantastically sinister voice as the elderly Munz the Explorer - it's all magical stuff. ""Up"" could even win an Oscar as best film?

Disc 1 also contains the wonderful short that preceded the movie ""Partly Cloudy"", trailers to ""Toy Story 3"" and ""The Princess & The Frog"", a making of ""Up"", alternate Munz endings, while Disc 2 contains loads of exclusive bonus material. Disc 3 is the DVD and Disc 4 is a CD (complete with code) that you load into your Mac or PC to get a digital download copy of the film (portable). It's all fabulous stuff and a genuine joy to look at.

Pixar has set ludicrous standards before, but ""Up"" is just 'so' good - major-league kudos to all involved.

It all begins very much like It's A Wonderful Life. Young Carl Fredricksen and friend Ellie have a shared passion: adventure. Specifically, they both idolize adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who travels the world in his gigantic airship, the Spirit of Adventure. But when Muntz can't prove that a unique skeleton he brought back from South America's Paradise Falls isn't a fake, he is publicly disgraced. Vowing to go back and find the proof to clear his name, he boards his airship in anger and disappears into the clouds.

Meanwhile, Ellie tells Carl that she wants a house on top of Paradise Falls, and Carl innocently crosses his heart in promise to give it to her. When they grow up, Carl and Ellie marry, and, as in It's A Wonderful Life, they move into the rickety old house they once played in. They fix it up and live there for many happy years until Ellie passes away. Carl ends up as a crotchety old widower with an enormous building project going up all around him - and they want him out. So, remembering his promise to Ellie, and to escape his gloomy fate, he ties a zillion helium balloons to his house and takes off for South America and Paradise Falls.

This is an adventure par excellence, very European in feel, with the charm of Ratatouille. But it is an odd assortment of characters. Besides Carl, who looks very much like Spencer Tracy and is played by Ed Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), there's a stowaway: boy Wilderness Explorer, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's working on his Helping Old People merit badge; a canine named Dug (Bob Peterson) that they meet in South America, and who has an electronic collar that allows him to talk; and Kevin... There are a pack of dogs, all with talking collars, but three main ones besides Dug: Alpha (again, Bob Peterson), Beta (Delroy Lindo) and Gamma (Jerome Ranft). Alpha has trouble with his collar, so that it produces a very high-pitched voice, which for an alpha dog is very embarrassing.

Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., story for WALL-E et al) and Bob Peterson (screenplay for Finding Nemo, story artist for Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life) co-directed this tale from a script by Peterson. It's a very sweet and funny story, full of poignant reminders that, while we need to seek adventures in life, the most important adventures are the ones we go on in our daily lives: such as marriage and parenting. The importance of fatherhood resonates in the relationship between Carl and Russell. Then there's Kevin...

I think the biggest laugh comes when Russell's face is slammed against the window of Muntz's airship, and then is dragged across it making a streaking sound, while Muntz's eyes follow it inside. Of course, Russell is funny in general, being so naive. Then there are the dogs, who refer to Russell as ""the small mailman"" because of his Explorer uniform. Just about every dogism is used, from their love of balls and hatred of squirrels, to the dreaded ""cone of shame."" Dug is especially enjoyable because he is the quintessential dog every kid loves.

Visually, the film is stylized in a very lovable way, similar to a children's book. My favorite part are the balloons - they're terrific. This type of imagination and adventure builds strong values in kids. Contrast it with the previews that precede the movie of Disney fare that do little more than teach kids to live in out-of-touch dream worlds. It's hard to understand how Pixar and Disney joined forces. Disney doesn't seem to have a clue, and Pixar has every clue. I thank God for Pixar. They are just about the only bastion of good-quality, family-oriented movie-making left. Walen Media, who is so into books,  should borrow a page from Pixar's. May Pixar's tribe increase.

Unfortunately, three of the last seven US blu-ray titles that I purchased have been spiked to stop them playing on all region blu-ray players from overseas.  Fortunately this set includes a regular DVD that I can still play.  This means that although I paid for blu-ray quality, I have to be content just watching UP in standard definition.  I guess the message is clear.  My all region blu-ray player has now stopped being an all region player for new releases and I won't be able to shop on Amazon.com for Blu-rays any more.....

The old codger is the cranky fuddy duddy you would shy from checking the mail if he was in the front yard next to yours. I don't want to hear it. The wilderness explorer kid is a slap in the face contrivance to the boy scouts of America that they are a herd of cutsie wootsie beings trying to be a flame of gosh golly gee goodness. Wrong. Boy scouts are a serious bunch of explorers that surround themselves in fun with what they are doing. Learning to be a better American, and not a bothersome kid. The dogs should have taken over production as the short animation extra, Special Mission, proves they were more adorable, original, and could hold their own turf away from the dreary humans. Even the extra Partly Cloudy was a milestone in comparison to the main feature. I mean what is with these features. The artists conjure up some finally drawn character, give them some rather cliche typecast traits and expect the audience to fall in love.

7569349,5,B019A3QMJA,"From my wife Sarah: Adults - Don't miss this movie. I was completely surprised at how touching and emotional this movie was for me as an adult. I expected the usual level of ""Disney cute"" - and I got it to the extreme, but I had no idea how deep this movie would go to pull at my heart strings. I've never cried when watching a cartoon, but I cried several times during this movie.

Towards the beginning of the movie, without giving anything away, I'll just say that you watch something deeply beautiful unfold, and then something deeply sad happens. Young children most likely won't even realize what happened, but adults will get it. It was done so well, that it was really touching. By the end of the movie I was crying because I was so touched and uplifted. It was more moving than many adult movies I've seen lately, and so well done. There was ultimately some very positive messages in this movie. I was surprised at how meaningful it was.

Then there was the whimsy. What a creative story. It was truly a work of visual art, and a wonderful, well-written and conceived original fantasy. There was so much creative genius - from the house carried away by balloons to the collar on the dogs that could make them talk. There were many surprises that had me laughing gleefully. There was sensational character development. In fact, I found myself really caring about what happened to them. The writers and animators have an uncanny ability to make the characters just so cute! The actors did a fantastic job as well.

All I can say is that I loved this movie. It was precious, adorable, beautiful and so worth seeing for adults and children alike. I know I sound like I'm ranting a bit, but I think it's not to be missed. I do wish I had seen it in 3-D in the theater, but it was still wonderful on DVD.",1265414400,,1807,4.42042042042042

The idea of having your Pixar movies there is good, but eventually you run out of space. If you have all Pixar movies you will be out from the get-go.

Then theres the lighting... When the lamp is turned on the top of the lamp lights up too, because the plastic is so thin. This means that half the lamp is glowing plastic and the rest is dark, as it should be. This does not IMO look very good, so I keep it off.

The positioning of the lamp is also very limited because most joints only have spring action, but no fastener... So you can position it pretty much any way you want, but it will snap back when you let go.

It had a few funny moments, but overall, I found it rather sad and depressing.  It was marketed as an uproarious comedy, but somehow an old man losing his wife and being forced out of his home just aren't funny subjects.  I know sometimes in entertainment, bringing the audience down makes the funny parts seem funnier, but this movie just fell a little flat for me.

A lot of the story didn't make sense.  Not that everything has to make sense, but the childhood idol of that old man should have been long-dead or at least approaching 100 years old, so the character just didn't fit.  The thing with the dogs was entertaining at times (SQUIRREL!!!) but largely didn't hit it for me either.

7569388,5,B019A3QMJA,"From the beginning, Pixar has made films based on premises that I thought were going to be bad. A film about toys? A film about bugs? A film about fish? A film about talking cars? A film about a cooking rat? Yet, time and again, they've not only made the premise work, they've made it exceptional. (Actually, I didn't personally like the cooking rat film, but my point still stands.)

So by the time that I saw a preview for Up, I knew not to dismiss their weird premises. A film about a house flying because it's tied to a bunch of balloons? Eh, they've done weirder.

What I was not expecting, but should have, was that this flying house would provide the backdrop for a deeply poignant film about overcoming grief and embracing life. While all the films carry important thematic elements, I'd say that this is the first of the Pixar movies that adults can actually appreciate more for the adult themes than kids will appreciate for the fun parts. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of fun stuff for kids ... but the story is something you have to be a little bit older to really grasp.

From the first few minutes, where we see a montage of Carl Fredrickson's (played by Ed Asner) life, adults especially connect to him in a very personal way, because it's clear that he's led a rich, full life ... but also that many unanticipated, tragic things have happened to him. He is now an old man, a widower, and about to lose everything. So, in reaction, he decides to go on a final adventure ... and take his house along with him.

The adventure, though, is really the old adventure he (and his wife) had always longed for but never achieved. It was not intended as an affirmation of his life, but a conclusion to it. It was not about boldly stepping into the future, but about connecting to his past. And, through the course of the film, Carl realizes that life isn't over until it's over.

It's a powerful message, woven into a film which kids will appreciate for the cute chubby Wilderness Explorer Russell, the talking dogs (some of whom fly airplanes), and the big crazy colorful bird. But someday, when they're much older, they'll realize that they had very different adventures from the ones they once dreamed of ... but that doesn't make them any less valuable. And maybe they'll think of Up, and realize there was a lot they missed in that film.",1264809600,,2353,4.488317757009346

I had the exact opposite experience. I found Wall-E to be so-so and The Incredibles to be a wonderful film because of the human element attached to it. Also, both The Incredibles and this film, UP, had a PG rating and not a G, which might mean that deeper, perhaps disturbing things, made this film carry more emotional weight. And it most certainly does.

Edward Asner plays Carl Fredricksen, a man who's loved and lost. Yes, we ACTUALLY get to see an old person pass away at the end of their life ...in an animated feature. Imagine that. Reality. This gives Up more bite and we empathize with Carl on a very basic human level. Whereas with Wall-E, we're trying to gain empathy for a machine that's acting like a human. Not the same thing.

Into Carl's lonely life comes wannabe boy scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's trying to earn a merit badge. But Carl wants none of his help, nor does he want to help Russell gain the badge.

Amidst Carl's life is his understanding that his now dead wife Ellie never got to have any adventures. She married Carl and bought a home, which took over their lives and made them home-bodies. They both grew up worshipping adventurer Charles Muntz and wanting to go and find out what happened to him. But Ellie never made it. So, when Carl's house is being threatened by developers and his life steered toward Shady Oaks retirement facility, Carl attaches a mass of helium balloons to his house and floats away. Trouble is, that pesky boy scout is on-board, too.

Eventually they make their way to South America and discover dangers, foes, friends, and, yes, adventure. Talking dogs with an obsession for squirrels add a high amount of hilarity to several scenes, as does a unique bird that befriends Russell and loves chocolate.

More telling is the friendship that blossoms between Russell and Carl as the generation gap closes, and Carl learns to open his heart (and mind) to new experiences. Also learning to let go of Ellie's memory adds an incredibly deep plot-line to an amazing story.

The animation, like most 3-D style animations, is impressive. The colors, shadows, and depth made the scenes come alive. But it's the story that makes it all worthwhile. Just like The Incredibles, this is a tale about human beings doing unique things but with regular challenges and mental hurdles. It is this that drives me to see complex animated films, not a robot .",1264291200,2,2904,5.2613390928725705
7569395,5,B019A3QMJA,I really enjoyed this movie. It was a christmas gift. I have watched it over and over. It has some depressing parts but I love the overall mood of the story. It makes you feel good inside.,1264291200,,188,4.108108108108108

My older player (Magnavox) played it just fine, but the HCT player got stuck in a loop right after the previews. This has only happened to one other Blu Ray movie, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.",1264291200,,376,4.026666666666666
7569397,4,B019A3QMJA,"Like most people, I expect, when I sat down to watch ""Up"" I believed I was going to see a funny cartoon. Fortunately for me this movie turned out to be so much more.
Now I understand that animated movies aren't all ""just for children."" There have been animated movies made for a more mature audience for as long as movies have been made. But I don't see ""Up"" as being made for a mature audience, merely for a thoughtful one(besides, anyone with children know just how much they resent being talked down to).
""Up"", to me, is about dealing with loss. Each of the five main characters has to deal with some type of loss and this is the meat of the movie. There are comedic moments and they are wonderful but I found myself being engaged by the cast as each struggles with his own issue and does, or doesn't work through it.
I found this an enjoyable movie, very entertaining.",1264204800,,872,4.355828220858895
7569398,4,B019A3QMJA,"Everything about the latest Pixar release, Up, sounds like it shouldn't work.  The main character is a curmudgeonly senior citizen (voiced perfectly by Ed Asner), the villian is an even older crank (voiced by Christopher Plummer) with an army of talking dogs at his beck and call and the movie begins where many stories would end:  at what appears to be the conclusion to a rich and fulfilling life enjoyed by the now bitter and lonely main character.

The grumpy old man in question is Carl and as the movie begins, we are treated to a brief but brilliantly crafted prologue that shows us how he met and married his childhood sweetheart Ellie.  In a much talked about 4 minute passage of the film that contains no dialogue, we watch their life together from their wedding day to Ellie's death.  It is a beautiful segment that speaks volumes about the joys and disappointments of life without a single word being spoken.

Flash forward to the present, where Carl has become an angry shut-in desperately clinging to his home and the memories of his past life with Ellie. With developers pressuring him to sell his home, and facing the prospcet of being carted off to a retirement community, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his beloved home and float away to Paradise Falls, an exotic locale that he and his late wife always dreamed of visiting but never quite got around to.

Ok, so the whole floating house thing requires the willing suspension of disbelief, but that's really not a problem since as soon as Carl is airborne, we are swept up in the story which, as it turns out, is fairly conventional. Carl is unknowingly accompanied by Russell, a jovial wilderness scout who is attempting to earn his ""assisting the elderly"" merit badge.  When the two arrive at Paradise Falls, they are joined by Doug, a talking dog who has rebelled from his pack, and Kevin, a rare and exotic bird that is being hunted by the movie's villian.

Again, the plot is fairly conventional.  Carl finds himself becoming very close with Russell and he learns that life is always full of new beginnings.  He also has to foil the plans of the would be bird hunter and his canine minions.  Nothing that happens in Up (aside from dogs flying fighter planes) will come as much of a shock to anyone.  What will stay with you, however, is the generosity of spirit and adventure the film offers and the surprisingly powerful emotions that it stirs up by merely showing us that life doesn't have to end when the people we love are lost.  That's a bold statement for any film to make, let alone a cartoon about a man and his floating house.",1264118400,,2622,4.610752688172043
7569399,5,B019A3QMJA,"Soon after starting the movie, I came to the conclusion that this was geared more toward adults than children.  There were several serious momemts which out weighed the few funny ones.  Ed Asner was great as the old man, you couldn't help but feel all the same emotions as the old man did.  Really liked the scenes with the bird and dog, these parts help to lighten up the mood of the film.  Wish I could write more but don't want to give away what happens in the movie.  Overall, this was a great film, it made you look back on your own life and dreams yet unfulfilled.",1264032000,,570,4.2407407407407405

7569405,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar as of late seems like it can do no wrong with some of the best and most original films of recent years. Up fit that mold perfectly. It centers on a cranky elderly man named Carl whose intent on fulfilling a dream of his late wife of taking a trip to an exotic place in South America. Unintentionally a wide eyed kid, Russell, tags along, and Carl has no choice but to deal with the annoyance.

In truly unique Pixar fashion they make the totally impossible believable, like that a house could fly with helium filled balloons, or that a device could be made to allow dogs to speak. There are wonderfully funny and inventive things abound. But it's the compelling characters and heartfelt story are really what makes it so great. There's a five minute montage at the beginning that, without the use of dialog, encapsulates the life of a married couple, and it's truly a most brilliant accomplishment. That sets the tone for the rest of the film, and while it doesn't end quite as strong as it starts it never losers its heart and sense of wonder.

Ratatouille was one of my favorite films of 2007, Wall-E one of my tops from 2008, and now Up ranks easily as one of 2009's best films. I love Pixar.

The special features in the four disk set leave some to be desired. I'm not sure why Disney can't do commentaries for these Pixar masterpieces. The blu-ray extra disk in the four disk set basically includes only a short making of documentary and a few other small things. Nevertheless, the four disk set is definitely the one to get. Even if you don't have a blu-ray player the DVD version is also included, and once you do go blu-ray you won't have to buy the movie again to watch it that way. The digital copy is also included which I gave my mom because I personally don't care about watching movies on my computer.",1263772800,,1821,4.429850746268657

But Up manages to accomplish this feat in such a fully realized way that I consider it the best movie I've seen all year.  It's marketed for kids (mostly), and they will certainly be able to enjoy it on a much more basic level, but all adults should see it too.  I promise that you will not be disappointed!",1263513600,,462,4.75
7569414,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up is a film that is buoyed by fantasy but anchored in deep human emotion. Carl is a recent widower who decides to set his house afloat and take it and himself to Paradise Falls, somewhere in South America. Chance has young Boy Scout Russel on the house with him, and when close to their destination both decide to work together to get the house right where it needs to be. In comes Kevin, a massive ostrich/peacockesque creature, along with well-meaning pup Dug, and together the foursome work to beat the evil Charles Muntz who is bent on using Kevin to further his fame.

But that's just the plot. Up succeeds so well because of its storytelling power, and how well it balances its light and dark moments. The film moves from its deeply sad prologue to scene after scene incredible imagination. The visuals can't be beat; a house suspended by balloons drifting through the clouds, a chase over a canyon, the characters climbing the walls of a zeppelin. The pacing is also noteworthy- the film never drags and consistently has a new and original turning point to keep it exciting. The film also does an excellent job in dealing with adult love and loss in a manner that is both abrupt and warm, and wouldn't detract its younger viewers from enjoying the film's lighter parts. Very funny and moving, Up is as good as anything Pixar has ever released.",1263513600,,1351,4.629166666666666

THERE'S KIDS HANGING FROM BALLOONS 1,000 MILES IN THE AIR! GOOD MOVIE THOUGH :}",1263427200,,408,4.602739726027397
7569416,2,B019A3QMJA,"The marketing portrays UP as a lighthearted comedy adventure. It isn't. While there are certainly funny moments, on the whole it's the most depressing movie I've seen in years, and the contrast between the expectation and the reality is shocking. I love dark movies, but the way UP is presented borders on deceptive. I almost wonder if this film was intended as a psychological experiment.

I saw UP in the theater. Seated in the row in front of me was a family of ogres who'd spent the day stomping an orphanage flat. They'd brought a box of kittens to snack on during the movie. Within 10 minutes of  the start of the film every one of them was bawling uncontrollably. I'm a stone-cold heartless monster myself, and *never* cry in movies... until UP. Hey Pixar, here's a tip: tears ruin the 3D effect.

Presumably the intention was use the death of the old man's wife as a starting point for an ultimately uplifting (no pun intended) story. Unfortunately, it casts such a dark shadow on the rest of the movie that the funny bits don't even begin to make up for it. Dug the dog is the brightest aspect of the movie and a hilarious character, but doesn't balance out the cascade of tragedies great and small that befall the old man. Seeing the old man tied to his house like a pack animal and being forced to drag it through the jungle is one of the *lighter* moments. WTH? The happy ending really rings hollow, and isn't worth the journey it takes to get there.

I considered not mentioning this next point, but I'm going to go ahead and do so anyway. My mother-in-law died a few months before UP came out, and my father-in-law was, as one would expect, devastated. My wife and I both separately came to the conclusion that if he'd seen the movie he absolutely would have gone home and eaten his shotgun afterward. I know that I used hyperbole earlier in this review, but on this point I'm being completely serious and not exaggerating.

From a technical standpoint, UP is superb. The animation, character design, vocal performances, etc. are all top notch, just as you would expect from Pixar. However, I would only recommend it to emotional cripples, psychopaths, and people who have never experienced the loss of a loved one.",1263340800,9,2229,4.604534005037784

7569422,3,B019A3QMJA,"I'm not a die hard fan of animated movies and I usually like them vs. loving them. But I'd heard great things and had lots of folks recommend it as an awesome movie so I went ahead and rented it.

My overall thoughts:

I like the idea of an animated film about an adult. The story of the man who went on an adventure in his lawn chair has always intrigued me and I loved his simple philosophical reason for his trip, ""You can't just sit there."" (paraphrased). So this story idea appeals to me. Very much.

I loved Russell, the little kid who pesters Mr. Fredericksen and Dug, a speaking dog they find on their adventures. Mr. Fredericksen is extremely spot-on. I've encountered this guy before. Russell and Mr. Fredericksen have a Mr. Wilson and Dennis the Menace type of relationship which wasn't my favorite but as the adventure progressed, so did the relationship, and it ended up being a very, very sweet thing.

This film is darker than I thought it might be and I don't see it appealing to any kids I know. For starters the opening takes a long time to get to the current story and I was bored with it. Secondly, it's creepy when they encounter the many scary dog minions and the evil master. Kevin the bird annoyed me and though I understand there had to be something thrown in to make the movie more edge of the seat, it just didn't work for me.",1262995200,3,1353,4.357142857142857

I bought this as a gift for the family to enjoy over the winter break on one of our traditional movie nights.
To say the least, it was a film of utmost expression by Disney's Pixar. They were very successful in bringing out life-like situations with true beauty- with some funnies added in between.
The depth of expression of emotion is truly commendable. The only thing I found a bit to powerful was the deep sense of melancholy and sadness in certain parts of the film. I would not say that I experienced grief, but Disney is so good as conveying emotion that it takes away from some of the ""fun and adventure""-like feeling of the film.

7569440,3,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is the latest work from Pixar, a company which has given us wonderful animated films like ""Ratatouille"" and last year's ""WALL*E."" With each work they release, our expectations naturally get higher and higher. Perhaps this is why I was not impressed with Pixar's ""Up"" very much. The film flies, but doesn't soar.

The best part of ""Up"" is its opening 10 minutes, where a young boy named Carl Fredricksen meets a tomboyish girl Ellie. They marry, and spend the life together (not without sad moments, however), both dreaming of someday travelling to Paradise Falls in South America. This excellent introductory section almost looks like a stand-alone short film with a very emotional conclusion.

The rest of the film is about the 78-year-old Carl and his adventures, accompanied by a very talkative little boy named Russell. Carl sets out for South America in his house floating in the sky using thousands of balloons. Their journey is full of actions, jokes and lessens to be learned - you get chases, visual gags, and even ""dog fights"" (literally) - and they are always entertaining, if not as touching as the film's initial part.

With superb visuals, ""Up"" remains entertaining throughout, but its story lacks something that draws the viewers into the fantasy world it depicts. This is not to say the film is bad, but with a better storyline and more interesting characters, ""Up"" would have been a masterpiece.",1262563200,2,1417,4.970464135021097

While I  enjoyed the movie and there were portions that were hilarious, I don't quite get the total rave reviews on this.  At times the movie moved a bit slowly and the story line didn't flow for me as I expected -- particularly the shamed explorer who is at The Falls (dont' want to give too much away).

I still compare almost all animation to ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters, Inc.""  which I liked better. To borrow a phrase -- good but not great",1262563200,,671,4.123076923076923

7569443,5,B019A3QMJA,"The Pixar machine has so many feathers in its cap it now looks like a Vegas showgirl. UP is Pixar's tenth animated feature film and I would say that it's among the studio's best, except that each of its pictures tends to rank pretty much right up there. And it's looking more and more like there's no end in sight concerning Pixar's run of awesome. (Rumor has it that John Lasseter, Pixar's head honcho, once broke wind and it smelled like dandelions on a gorgeous summer day.)

While on the surface still very much geared towards kids' sensibilities, UP trots out some fairly mature adult themes. If the first twelve minutes of UP don't at least choke you up, then you are a soulless cyborg. The opening act is a nearly dialogue-less montage, and it encapsulates the life of a man. This segment is absolutely key to setting up the rest of the story, makes you root for the old cranky, creaky gent Carl Fredricksen. The stuff that he goes thru, the sadness that crushes him, the dreams and hopes that get dashed because life simply got in the way - you know exactly why he goes on to do what he does. Which is sail away in his house strung up on thousands of balloons.

You'd have to be an utter grinch to bring up the slovenly physics involved, so let's not. Hundreds of feet up in the air, Mr. Fredricksen hears a knock on his door. Bemused, he opens it and sees Russell cowering on his porch. Russell is a tubby eight-year-old wilderness scout, and he's enthusiastic and, if I'm brutally honest, borderline annoying. The kid needs to earn his Assisting the Elderly badge and he's set his eyes on Mr. Fredricksen. We learn eventually that Russell's overeagerness may be his way of compensating for tough times at home. UP, at its core, is about these two characters and their emotional journeys and it's also about the process of, while not exactly putting the past to bed, at least moving on. Carl and Russell move on to South America (""It's like America - but South!"").

UP is an extremely moving, heartbreaking picture, but it's also very funny and features several things which may make you cry out ""Adorable!"" ad nauseam. The main villain of the piece is deranged and sinister, and his assistants consist of a pack of talking dogs. Which leads me to this: I love Dug! Dug is one of the talking dogs, a rambling, whuffy Labradorish type, and he's exactly what you'd expect a lovable dog to be like. Dug isn't as clever or focused as the other dogs. He just wants to be loved, and Bob Peterson, the co-writer & co-director of the thing, comes up with the perfect voice for him. Also a neat character is Kevin the giant bird, but Kevin doesn't have a fancy collar which allows her dialogue.

The animation is flawless. Why even go into it? It's Pixar.

The single DVD version also comes with two riotous bonus animated shorts. ""Partly Cloudy,"" which preceded UP in the theaters, pokes holes in the bird and the bees theory. Babies instead come from clouds. ""Partly Cloudy"" tells the story of one slightly seedy-looking cloud which leans towards making the not-so-cute babies and the poor stork that has to deliver them. ""Dug's Special Mission"" is narrated thru Dug's perspective as we see the moments leading up to Dug's first meeting with Mr. Fredricksen and Russell.

I like the visual twist of a house kept aloft by a gazillion balloons, and then this floating house being toted around by our characters as if it were one big balloon. Rather than chilling in the crib, Mr. Fredricksen and Russell actually spend more time outdoors tethered to the house and towing it with them. ""Adventure is out there!"" is an often mentioned motto in the movie, and our characters land themselves in a wild, exotic adventure. Fun for the kids, fun for the grown-ups, and bolstered by powerful dramatic undertones. UP is absolutely terrific and everyone should go check i--SQUIRREL!""",1262390400,,3873,4.646715328467153
7569444,4,B019A3QMJA,"Love the movie, but the sleeve the DVD came in was scratched in multiple places (the color came off, and now are just white splotches).

7569445,4,B019A3QMJA,"Welcome to the world of Carl, a crotchety old widower whose life passed by before he got the chance to do so many things he wanted to with his beloved wife, Ellie. And Russell, a young, deeply lonely kid desperately seeking affection and support from a world of adults that never seem to have time for him.

Up! is about love and loss, aging and growing up, loneliness and missed opportunities. There are definitely some aspects of the movie that don't contribute as much as others, and I'm not sure how well it really plays to children as opposed to adults, but two montages in particular were hauntingly powerful for me. I and people I love certainly teared up in certain parts. Yet it's far from depressing, to my mind. It reaffirms that life with people you love--however quiet and unassuming and (sometimes) full of sacrifices--is the ultimate adventure, whether or not it turned out exactly as you might have dreamed. That meaning, and ultimately happiness, in life comes from caring and extending oneself for others, at any age. That older people have an incredible amount to offer, even if they can't do everything they might wish to. That bonds of affection and trust between generations can be strengthening and healing to both. That life doesn't have to end with death or abandonment or old age, so long as you can open yourself up to loving and serving others.

For that alone, I think this movie was valuable.",1262390400,,1422,4.729838709677419

I won't say much about the story because you either probably already know or don't want to know. I knew nothing about the story going in, and I loved being surprised. It's a wonderful film for all ages, and the visual imagery was breathtaking.",1262304000,,420,4.197530864197531
7569448,3,B019A3QMJA,"The story goes that when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story/dp/B0030IIZ4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story</a>&nbsp;was first envisioned, it was as Yet Another of their award winning animated shorts until somewhere along in the process someone got the bright idea of turning it into Pixar's first feature.

The rest, as they say, is history.  If something similar was going on with this movie, and I suspect that it was, it is proof that longer is not always better, not even from Pixar.  They took the potential Best Animated Short EVER and turned it into a so-so 90-minute movie.

The beginning is animation and movie making at its best; the short scene depicting a lifetime of marriage with nary a word spoken may be the most emotionally moving piece of animation ever created; and the scene where the house takes flight is, figuratively and literally, the high point of the movie.  A short coda, say showing future explorers finally reaching the top of the falls and finding the house impossibly but successfully perched there, would have finished off a stunning animated short.  Pixar chose to continue on, unwisely IMHO, because once you've reached the high point the only way to go is down.

The first descent was to turn this movie into Yet Another story of an irascible old man coping with a child who fails to grasp that he isn't really wanted, hardly the most original idea, though setting it in a floating house provides some novelty.  Will a persistent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dennis/dp/1560978074/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dennis</a>&nbsp;finally melt Mr. Wilson's icy heart?...  Uh, that is, will a persistent Russell finally melt Mr. Fredericksen's icy heart?  Especially with the added poignancy of Russell's quixotic motive: winning back the love and attention of a father lost through divorce?

Do you really have to ask?

The second descent was to blow away any remaining realism by introducing talking dogs and a gigantic reject from the cast of Pixar's academy-award-winning short&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-the-Birds/dp/B00005JKDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For the Birds</a>.  This produces lots of funny jokes, but at the expense of any remaining plausibility,...

and causes serious problems for the third descent: the return of a forgotten character as an embittered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Nemo/dp/B00005JKU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Nemo</a>, a mad genius turned killer because the world has wronged him.  This mixture of darkness and light, grimness and whimsy, simply fails to work at all, not least because the villain ought to be over a hundred years old by now.

Finally, this movie gets an ""F"" for its understanding of the problems of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cryptozoology/dp/0684856026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cryptozoology</a>.  As a practical matter, in order to protect a rare and endangered animal you first have to prove that it exists, and that ultimately requires a specimen.  If you can bring it in alive, so much the better, but bring it in you must.  As one by no means heartless or cruel scientist investigating Bigfoot put it, we need a body.  The first hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be given a medal; the second hunter to bring in a Bigfoot should be SKINNED.  Now, it is perfectly understandable that people would be squeamish about this idea when we are talking about, at the very least, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/man-like-creature/dp/B000MRNWKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">man-like creature</a>, what Edgar Rice Burroughs would call an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/anthropoid-ape/dp/0786408251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">anthropoid ape</a>, but it is sheer idiocy to take this attitude about a giant bird that in real life would have been following Russell and Mr. Fredericksen...

7569449,5,B019A3QMJA,"Besides being filmed in the world's most awe-inspiring scenery, the beauty of UP is that it was made in the pre-politically correct era of hang gliding. The pilot, Ed Cesar, can be seen soaring at 15,000 feet above vast snow-covered mountains and lakes with neither helmet nor parachute on the most antiquated of wings. No apologies, no disclaimers, no long boring sermons about how safe modern hang gliding is (""safe hang gliding"" - isn't that an oxymoron?). The flying and the sites are both quite risky, and it doesn't look at all safe when he somehow becomes detached from the glider and falls thousands of feet. How about when he takes the 12-year-old boy for a tandem flight, the child suspended to the wing only by his belt loops; can you imagine the outrage of child protection advocates today?

UP is hang gliding at it's fantastic best - exhileration, scenery, danger; the spectacular views very much worth risking your life for. Save for a few brief exchanges between man and eagle, there is virtually no dialogue. The movie won an Oscar for Best Live Short Film in 1984.

We got that out of the way. This is a review of the ""Blu-ray 4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD"" of the film.

There are so many dealbreaker flaws in this release I cannot begin to list them, nor can I begin to list how livid I am.

As we know, times are tough. For Christmas we saved and scraped to get a Blu-Ray player SPECIFICALLY to watch this film at home. So, imagine the letdown when we can't hear anything because the English audio on the Blu-Ray disc is only in DTS. (DTS? What is this a laserdisc from 1995????) So, if I want to hear this, I now have to pop $$ we can ill-afford on a DTS decoder. Those of you who raved about the DTS sound quality....I don't doubt it, but I can't verify that either, because Disney hasn't allowed me that option for reasons I can't imagine.

If DTS really is ""all that"" then why aren't the Spanish & French tracks also in DTS?

Instead, we can hear it in French or Spanish because that's on Dolby Digital.

Never mind the fact we had to buy a DVD disc and a ""digital copy"" disc we didn't want in order for us to GET the Blu-Ray disc.

Did I mention there are no subtitles? No 3D version in any of the 4 discs?

Is it ANY wonder Amazon has it at $18, down from a list price of $46? I'm returning this useless copy tomorrow, and getting Harry Potter 6 instead.

7569467,5,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is an outstanding motion picture; and it earned the honor of being the first animated 3D film to open the Cannes Film Festival. No wonder, too--the story is endearing with lots of action depicting the classic struggle of good versus evil; the animation is the best I've ever seen and the voiceovers leave nothing to be desired. The plot moves along very nicely with good character development and the action works very well alongside the tender message of the film that left me with a tear in my eye. Indeed, ""Up"" will remain one of the finest animated films of all time because it deals with so many universal issues and themes we think about in life--friendship, loyalty, love, the struggle of good versus evil and the desire to make your biggest dreams come true.

The film starts with us meeting two young kids, Carl and Ellie who worship their childhood idol, South American explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Carl and Ellie play together as kids and they grow up to be sweethearts and marry, too.  They are happy together; but their childhood dream of going to Paradise Falls where Charles Muntz discovered bones from an exotic bird never gets accomplished. Muntz has long since returned to Paradise Falls after he was labeled a fraud back home; he told reporters when he left again for South America's Paradise Falls that he will bring back the actual bird dead or alive to prove his discovery was real but he never returned.

With time, Ellie and Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) become elderly and Ellie passes away. Carl's house is forever being threatened by new construction; and the court orders him to live at Shady Oaks nursing home after Carl accidentally hits construction worker Steve (voiced by Danny Mann) with his mailbox! Carl also meets a young wilderness explorer, Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). Carl devises a successful plan to have his house float away to Paradise Falls using helium balloons; but after taking off, Carl soon discovers that Russell is along for the ride!

Of course, there's much, much more to the plot with action and heartrending scenes that really are memorable. I don't want to spoil it for you by giving too much away. Suffice it to say that Carl does get to South America with Russell where they meet Kevin, a rare bird that loves chocolate and Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson), an incredibly sweet golden retriever. Unfortunately, however, there are some other animals that are not exactly friendly; and this causes huge problems after their other encounter with the now elderly and rather evil Charles Muntz.

This two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. We get an animated short entitled ""Partly Cloudy;"" ""Adventure Is Out There;"" ""Dug's Special Mission;"" an optional running commentary with co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson--and more! The second DVD lets you access the digital copy and the digital copy code is provided with the artwork inside the DVD case.

Loved it in the theater and now at home but the case it came in was opened upon arrival so now I just wonder about the quality of the disc (is it bad in some way?). It's probably just an unlucky/weird irregularity that it arrived with the open case and a disc that looks oddly pressed (the bottom of the disc looks like it has a unusual blotch on the disc). It works fine though and hasn't decreased my enjoyment of the film

After several attempts we figure it might be firmware so we port the movie to our other BD Player (different brand) and the Blu-Ray version of the movie will not play! In addition, as a test we tried to play the Blu-Ray ""Special Features"" disc and it will not play. I'm not wasting any more time on this defective product to determine if the digital copy will play on the computer. Enough troubleshooting and problem resolution for what should be a simple plug and play function!! Of course the Standard Definition disc plays just fine......DUH!!

As many other Amazon Customers have written in their reviews this is a great movie, but very poorly executed BR discs. I too as others have stated will make this my last Disney and Pixar product purchase. Their executive management team can take their bottom line and, well you know the rest. If Disney likes kids as much as they profess they wouldn't be putting out defective products that disappoint these same kids they purport to serve so well. Disney, quit worrying about DRM, mission statements, peeling your onions back, drilling down, getting traction and all the other corporate hogwash because from the view at 30K feet your poorly executed products are costing you customers.",1261872000,19,1533,4.828897338403042

And, on top of that, why is a child being rewarded for leaving his mother without even telling her, to go off on some reckless adventure with a geezer who for all we know could be a registered sex offender?

I would not rent or purchase this film for my children, as I don't want them to grow up thinking this is (still) a man's world.

Considering that I only have a blu-ray player upstairs, its nice that my daughter can watch the regular DVD downstairs. And with her having her own iPod touch, the digital copy was a heck of lot easier than me having to rip the DVD, then convert, then add to iTunes.

UP has one of the saddest openings of any animated movie I've seen since The Fox and The Hound.  This movie not only makes you shed a tear but also makes you smile, warms your heart and will have you laughing out loud.  There is even some danger and suspense to mix things up a little more.

Voice performances are terrific, with a gravelly Ed Asner and an unexpected Christopher Plummer leading a cast who seem born to voice their parts.

But the visuals are stunning in blu-ray.  Please do your best to watch this on the best display you can!

As for nearly everything else pixar has done. Its dreck. Mindless characters and shallow atempts at humor. Cars is a movie that sufferd from many of these plot holes, but stile thanks to its wild idea was entertaining. Though for an adult it dosn't really make sense. Finialy Up. It takes what is like with Cars and takes out most of the cheap uncreative plots and situations. The movie much more realistic and down to earth.(in a character sense) I am a hard critic and have a movie collection well over 600, and have a wide range of likes. This I liked. I really think its the best disney movie since the Lion King. The animation makes cars look old, and the story brings fiften years of sub-par stories to shame. I would a recomend this movie for all ages. My wife loved it, and I liked it; that dosn't happen to often.

7569497,5,B019A3QMJA,"Now while ""UP"" did not make my #1 Pixar movie of all time (which is ""Ratatouille"", by the way) it certainly is one literally uplifting little delight with sparkling animation, lovable characters, and rip-roaring adventure.

Carl Frederickson is a retired balloon salesman and widower.  With the threat of urban sprawl and a court-ordered move to a retirement villa, Carl takes ties balloons to his house and takes off for a long-awaited trip to Paradise Falls.  But unbeknownst to him he has also accidentally carried off local scout Russell.  Despite efforts to return the annoying kid to the ground, the two quickly arrive at the intended destination. Convenient? I prefer to consider it plot device, and it certainly opens for the adventure that is the rest of the movie.

The animation is beautiful, and this is one of those movies that simply look better in sparkling Blu-Ray.  It's a funny, heartfelt, and moving story.

And yes, it is worth is to buy the Blu-Ray. I'm not always the biggest fan of all those silly extras, but the documentaries and other production thoughts are nearly as entertaining as the feature presentation.

It's quite entertaining and compelling to watch. The writers are very clever in the lines the canines say. The blu ray technology really dazzles you in this too. This is one of the better Disney movies. Shrek for instance was ok the first time, but the second and third were deplorably void of quality content. A children's movie? No wonder kids can be so rotten these days with this kind of output seeping into their young minds that their parents allow them to consume. Shrek is garbage.

7569502,3,B019A3QMJA,"(notice 3 stars is not a bad score! I would give it a 7.5)

 Pixar has established itself in the movie industry as the premire animation studio. Unrivaled in nearly every category from original concepts, to deep symbloism, to energetic color, and detailed animation, Pixar is nearing legendary status. You have to tip your hats to a studio that packs such quality and passion on a yearly base. The latest installment, Up, capitalizes on many of the stellar qualities Pixar has be known for.

 Up's greatest trait is how it uses animation. Pixar Studios continue to amaze me with the extreme detail and color used in their films. Lush, vivid palate of colors pop and shine through the film. The crisp animations put in Up are truly a site to see. Using wilderness to their advantage, Pixar paints beautiful vistas with their South American backdrop.

 Thematically, Up's story keeps Pixar's wonderful reputation of giving strong social comentary and overarching alligories. Matching the strength of Cars and Wall-E, Up holds more than its own  in depth. Up's message turned to be more entertaining than the plot was. Pixar delved into the absurdity realm one too many times for me to think of Up as a true masterpiece. As enjoyable as it was, Up transformed into more of a ""Saturday morning cartoon"" at pivital points where it could have achieved greatness. The opening third of the movie was some of the best story-telling and direction I have seen the company produce, and the ending was very heart-warming. It's a shame that the middle section could not keep the same greatness in story. It was a par movie, plot wise, but I couldn't help but think Pixar mixed to many concepts together.

 Pixar Studios has produced fine film. Up meets, and pushes past, many of Pixar's renown movie making qualities. Animation? Brilliant. Concept? Fantastic. Story? Janky in the middle, but superb on the inside and out. Exicution? As you've came to expect. This may not be Pixar in it's prime, but missing any Pixar film would be tragic.",1261699200,2,2025,4.846376811594203

7569508,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up was the story of two kids that happened to fall in love with one another, and their love contniued through childhood and into adulthood and beyond. During those years was a lot of happiness and a single want for both of the people involved: they wanted to go on a trip and follow their childhood idol to a waterfall that was placed in a really remote locale. The only problem with this plan was that life kept getting in the way and, ultimately, an old man's love fell ill and vanished from his life. This left him with nothing save memories and a house that the two had built, and even that was being threatened by building springing up all around their home. Then something happened to make the house a monolith that was to be torn down so, in his desperation, the old man turned to the one thing he knew. Balloons. Rigging the house with them, he took the home and saw it go airborne, finally allowing him and his memories the chance that they always wanted. The only problem with that was the stowaway that the old man wasn't expecting and the things he found when he got closer to his dream.

Up was not what I expected was was good nonetheless. It was sad, however, and the beginning of the movie touched me and made me wish that the old man would have gotten to do the things he wanted to do when he had his love by his side. you could tell he wanted that as well, and that the house wa smore than a house to him - it was a reflection of the life he had spent with the only person that understood him. As his balloon quest took him on his way, he was forced to choose between this and something he knew was right - and that said a lot on the way things normally play out. On one hand there is the ""right"" thing to do. On the other is the ""things one wants to do.""

I liked the tale because it took all sorts of things and showed them for what they were. Talking dogs, a person who was not what he was supposed to be, the love of a mother for its children, the hopes of a son as he wants nothing more than recognition from his Dad - all of these things play out and more in such a well-crafted tale. I also liked the fact that the ending was one I did not expect, just as the movie was one I was not expecting. That made me happy and, truthfully, the whole saga touched me and made me feel good about this pick-up.

I'm not sure if I would call this a kid's tale, and I say that because of the way it began. It was sad - depressingly so - and I didn't think all of that was what all parents want for their kids. It does have a lot of morality issues it places in front of its viewers, however, and those were interesting to see as they played out before this audience of one. Personally, i liked the story quite a bit and would say that i would be worth watching for children and parents alike. I'm not accustomed to saying that these day, either, but I thought this happened to be true here and recommend this for consumption on all age ranges - provided that parents agree with what is shown in the beginning.",1261612800,,3020,4.0893760539629005

People who say it's uplifting obviously weren't really paying attention to what was happening on the screen in front of them.  The parts of the movie that were supposed to be funny really weren't funny enough to dispell the sadness of the movie.  Also the plot wasn't all that good.

7569522,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up! is a profound movie.  Yes, it's animated and geared towards young children.  But the themes of disappointment, tragedy, loss and unfulfilled dreams resonate with adults.  Children will be amused by the clever humor and interaction between people, dogs and exotic birds.

The little boy, Russell, is a super cute character, a plump, cheerful innocent who aches for adult approval, especially since his bum father split from his Mom for some lady named ""Phyliss"".  His Wilderness Explorer motif is perfect.  I love that huge, ultra prepared backpack!  And Russell's Asian ethnicity reflects our diverse nation.

A strong anti-corporate theme runs through the film as faceless, black eyeglass wearing, dark suited zombies manipulate widower Carl Frederickson out of his home to allow hi rise development.

The animation is superbly rendered and colored but not synthetic or artificially perfect.

This is a great film that an entire family will enjoy.  The 3D theater release was superb but home theater technology is nowhere near big screen 3D yet.  Hence, no 3D version.

Its simply amazing and holds its steam (somewhat) till the very end.  Pixar is simply amazing and UP is without question the equal of any of the other Pixars' you may think is the best.  Do not miss it! Period!

BTW:  The blu ray is just absolutely mind boggling in picture quality and sound.  Dang near perfection.  So impressive for any movie out there... kids or not!",1261353600,,547,4.346534653465347

You had to feel the character played by Ed Asner (Mr. Frederickson), not only for his determination, but for his sentimental reasons of reaching his destination via his promise with his wife.  There many additions to the movie for those who kind of steal the scene(s) from the main character--Dug the dog and Russell, who belongs to a Boy Scout-type troup.

7569529,4,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" stands apart from most animated movies for two reasons. It begins with a lyrical and deeply touching portrayal of a life-long love affair of two people who meet and fall in love as kids -- and then marry and grow old together. This section, which lasts just a few minutes, is worth the price of admission alone. I can't think of another movie, animated or not, which paints such a lovely pictures of a marriage with all its joys and sorrows.

The other point that makes this movie stand apart is that the hero is a grumpy old man, beautifully voiced by Ed Asner. Again, it's wonderful to see a movie with a protagonist in his ""golden years.""

Apart from that, we have the usual cartoon fare -- a quest, a pair or heroes, some adorable sidekicks, a nasty villain. It's all very well done and amusing and often pretty to look at. The overarching metaphor is that we can escape our daily humdrum existence by daring to look up and challenge the clouds and that dreams may be postponed but should not be denied. But what stayed with me from this movie was that wonderful opening 10 minutes.",1261353600,,1091,4.45

Furthermore, these DVDs without the subtitles are going to make their way to Amazon.com as used copies for sale.

So us hearing impaired people are going to have to PURCHASE a NEW version to avoid risking buying a used copy that doesn't have subtitles.

Furthermore, why did you (Disney) decide to exclude hearing impaired people from the rental market in the first place?

7569532,5,B019A3QMJA,"Ever notice how Pixar movies don't usually have huge ""stars"" voicing the characters? It's because they don't need Angelina Jolie or Chris Rock to attract their audience. They don't hope that having ""famous"" voices will somehow make up for the lack of great content. It's because Pixar HAS great content that doesn't need gimmicks to succeed. Their audience knows exactly what it's going to get: quality. UP, without a doubt, is one of Pixar's best. Sweet, touching, funny, tender, inspiring, heartbreaking, subtle - it's all those things, and more. It's not ""dumbed down"" for kids' sake, and it doesn't contain any clumsily disguised, crude content that animated movies often contain in order to make it interesting for the adults. UP doesn't need any of that. Even though it's extremely symbolic, it somehow manages the seemingly impossible task of speaking directly the the hearts of people of all ages, from kids to adults to the elderly. Three generations of my family are all in love with this film. It is so deeply poignant that even writing about it is tugging at my heartstrings. An absolutely beautiful, amazing work of art.

7569547,5,B019A3QMJA,"I have to admit there are two reasons I took an immediate personal liking to Pixar's 2009 sure-fire contribution to the box office, the Emeryville studio's impressive computer-generated artistry reflecting the most dependable cash cow in the industry. The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met. Before the kids start moaning, you should also be aware that there are more than enough exotic animals, talking dogs, acts of aerial derring-do, and miscellaneous Indiana Jones-type thrills to counterbalance the film's more sentimental moments.

Co-directed and scripted by Bob Peterson and Pete Docter, the movie opens during the Great Depression when a young, shy boy named Carl Fredricksen meets tomboyish Ellie in an abandoned house that she has turned into a clubhouse. They discover they are both aspiring adventurers who dream of meeting intrepid explorer Charles F. Muntz and going to Paradise Falls in South America. An impressively executed montage follows as we watch Carl and Ellie grow up, get married, and grow old together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes a solitary curmudgeon unwilling to sell his home, which is the same house where he met Ellie, amid the high-rises being built all around him. An unexpected altercation occurs after a construction worker accidentally knocks over Carl's mailbox. Forced to move into a retirement home, he hatches a plan to tie thousands of helium-filled balloons (a dazzling effect) to his house and float away to Paradise Falls. What he doesn't count on is the appearance of Russell on his porch early in the flight, and together, they face a series of adventures involving a large flightless bird in iridescent colors searching for her chicks, a lovable golden retriever named Dug who expresses his thoughts by way of a voice-activating collar, and Muntz himself, who has become a Captain Nemo-like figure deep in the jungle with his massive zeppelin.

There is a refreshing emotional economy to the story. That's why the 96-minute film doesn't feel as ambitious as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratatouille/dp/B000VBJEEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratatouille</a>&nbsp;or last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>, but at the same time, there is a deeper emotional resonance in the dilemmas presented since they feel so human-sized. Even as the film becomes more formulaic in the second half, it maintains the limited perspective of its main character as the rudder. I feel that's the key difference between this and other more populated Pixar confections. The vocal work is terrific, especially since Ed Asner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Show/dp/B001RIYVYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a>) perfectly captures Carl's gruff exterior without resorting to cheap sentiment to reveal his vulnerability. Nine-year-old Jordan Nagai provides the right energetic bounce for Russell, while Christopher Plummer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B000AP04OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>) has a field day playing all the various shades of Muntz. Peterson himself does stellar vocal work as both Dug and the squeaky-voiced Alpha, the German shepherd leader of the dog pack. Younger children may be bored by the film's more deliberate pacing and even at the idea of cheering a septuagenarian, but the more patient ones will be well rewarded.

The 2009 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the obligatory short that that preceded screenings of the movie, ""Partly Cloudy"", a charming concoction in which clouds fancifully give birth to animals. Another five-minute short focuses on Dug's misadventures. Several pieces deal with individual components of the film, for instance, each character's development from inception to onscreen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being. There are alternate endings dealing with what to do with Muntz at the end, as well as one that expands on Carl and Ellie's backstory. Also included are an interesting making-of featurette, a documentary of the filmmakers' visit to the Tepuis Mountains in South America to research the film's overall design and storyline, a piece about composer Michael Giacchino's score, and the various trailers for the film.",1261008000,,4996,5.955431754874652
7569548,1,B019A3QMJA,"This has to be the all time worst animated PG movie I've ever seen. It has to be the first animated movie where they show blood. Blood in a children's movie! I realize that the MPAA is nothing more than a rubber stamp for the main stream motion picture corporations. If this movie had been made by an independent it would have received a PG-13. I mean, come on, a comedy. The last half of the movie was nonstop violence. There was, one very funny part to the movie and that was the plot error and what a big error it was. The movie begins with the adventurer Charles Munts, who was maybe 40, who went to South America to find a bird. Then fast forward through Carl Fredrickson's life from a child watching the adventures of Charles Munts to old age, maybe 75 years old. Then Carl Fredrickson travels to south America and meets Charles Munts who looks younger than Carl Fredrickson. What??? Let's do the math. If Carl Fredrickson was 10 at the beginning and Charles Munts was 40 and at the end Carl was 75 then Charles would be 105.

Between the fabulous animation and artistic beauty, the wonderful casting (Ed Asner as Carl the protagonist), the interesting and captivating story line, and the fun, UP is a joy to watch. It possibly could appeal to older viewers more than young ones since the essence of the story is a man facing the latter part of his life alone after losing his wife and best friend. He had promised her an adventure before she dies and does it in the most imaginative way, lifting his entire house off its foundation with thousands of helium baloons. He WAS a helium balloon sales person at the zoo. Much to his surprise he has a stowaway in the person a young and equally lonely soon to be Eagle Scout.

I would say that the first 3/4 of the movie is very good.  They do seem to make a considerable mistake in the latter part of the film in trying to turn it into a action film.  There are better animated films out there (ie: Toy Story, Meet the Robinsons, The Incredibles, Bolt etc), but Up is an enjoyable enough film, it's just not an all-time great movie or anything, it's a little above average.",1260921600,,704,4.434108527131783

The animation is incredible. The humans are still drawn very cartoonish but that helps with the story. The animals are drawn very lifelike and if you focus your attention on little things like the hair on the dogs or the feathers on the bird you will be amazed.
The voice acting is top notch. Ed Asner plays the old man and he pulls the story along fabulously.

Overall this is one of the best movies Disney/Pixar has put out in a long while.

However, I sat in the theater with my wife, both of us tearing up with lumps in our throats in the first half hour of the movie.  This sets the stage for a fun adventure that ends in a bittersweet triumph. The story is about life long love and the willingness to do almost anything to see your dreams through.

An exemplary film and easily one of the finest animated movies of them all, Up is up there with Fantasia and Snow White and you name it. Surprisingly sad at various points, this is an amazingly emotional film, which somehow feels funny, in a good way.

After seeing this in 3D in a theatre, I think the blu-ray is better. The 3D still felt like an effect; the blu-ray through hdmi on a decent flat screen is astonishing. The colors on Kevin the ""snipe"" were easily the deepest vermillion, most translucent purple, and so on, that I have yet to see on our LCD screen. Incredible, and a pleasure just on its own.

Add a perfect script, flawless animation with especially natural lighting effects, and an overall patina of unstinting quality, and Pixar has made an animated feature that will wear as well as any film of any sort. The retro feel is integral to its charm, and the whole story feels timeless. I really can't think of anything I don't like about Up. Even the sad bits feel authentic, not Disney fake.

The various extras are excellent, especially the short that preceeded Up in theatres, and the fascinating documentary about Tepui, the original Paradise Falls area in Venezuela. The folks who made this film seem very sweet and very smart, and that sums up Up.

Can't recommend this one highly enough.",1260835200,,1323,4.636752136752137

The way time progression was handled was brilliant.  To be able to view Carl and his deceased wife as children made us feel even more connected to these characters than we would have if they had left that whole time sequence out of the film.  She was spunky, he was quiet.  They made a sweet couple.  She had dreams that they never fulfilled, or so Carl thought.  What he found out in the end was an invaluable lesson...the joys of an ordinary life were treasured by his wife as an adventure in itself and made me realize that although most of our life is made up of the ordinary things like washing dishes, painting the porch and sorting socks...well, it's all an adventure nonetheless.

7569592,2,B019A3QMJA,"Personally, I loved ""UP.""  I thought it was a meaningful, beautiful movie.  My husband and myself especially loved the dogs!

HOWEVER, it was marketed as a kid's movie.  Like, Shrek, just because something is animated does not a children's movie make!  My children are 8, 6, and 3.  I may consider letting them see it around 10 years old.

Problems:
The long lost hero turns villain.  And, a really bad one at that.  He actually tries to murder a child, unacceptable!

The opening montage... beautiful.  BUT, a sensitive child will be very saddened by it.

The boy's father *never* shows up.  I don't care if that is reality for 50% of kids out there, mine don't need to be ""educated"" about that possibility.",1260576000,6,708,4.658536585365853

And then my husband watched it with me, and it was a tissue-fest, because we hope to be like that in our twilight years.

The DVD is jam-packed with nifty stuff. Very nifty stuff. The extra short, Dug's Special Mission, is very touching as well, as well as laugh-out-loud funny. The behind the scenes look at making Up was very informative and interesting, and explanations on why some choices were made, and others cast aside, were quite reasonable. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story, or who appreciates excellent animation. The DVD menus were easy to follow and the packaging wasn't stupid (giving the hairy eyeball towards the Wall-E special edition with the pull-out sleeves... bah!).

7569596,5,B019A3QMJA,"Seeing a lot of 1-star reviews without any logical base (Some people complaining about the two extra discs they are getting for free), I'm compelled to write a 5-star one, and give some info about content in Spanish in the 4-disc Blu-ray set.

The main feature in the Blu-ray disc is in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital @640 kbps, and to my ears the sound level and detail is exactly the same as the DTS English track, which is to say: awesome. The ""Cine explore"" feature also has Spanish audio. Same goes for the short ""Dug's mission"". In-movie text important to the plot is also in Spanish when you choose this language.

The documentaries contained in both the main disc and the second disc have Spanish subtitles, but the audio is in English-only. The Geography game, however, is fully dubbed to Spanish.

The third disc (a DVD) is English-only.

I haven't checked the language of the Digital Copy, but I'm sure it's English-only, too.

Considering the current price of this 4-disc set ($19.99 at the time of writing), you can consider the two extra discs, the DVD and the digital copy, as simply free perks, and enjoy the two Blu-ray discs that contain the actual meat. Bottom line: This is a must own for both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking people.

Forgot to say, lately Pixar films have had such weird premises (Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up) that when I first hear what the plot will be I think: WTH? and when I watch them the first time I'm left kind of unsatisfied after having already known too much about the plot through trailers and previews... But when I buy the disc, I find myself watching these movies time after time. They're highly enjoyable on subsequent screenings.

Well, Up is right up there with the rest of Pixar's collection of top notch films.

Somehow, they manage to squeeze a complex and mature love and loss sequence into what most would consider a kids' movie.  The film appeals to both adults and kids who would are sure to fixate on Doug, the talking dog, and Kevin.

It's a sweet movie... surprising, in some parts... that has character moments everyone in your family can relate to.  It deals with lost love, growing old, being a child, childhood adventure, and family.  If you're a dog lover, you will have something that appeals to you too.

This movie can be heart-breaking, at times.  I know in the theater I misted up in three separate parts, and viewing the DVD at home does not change the pathos of those moments.  Your experience may vary.  As a woman starting the last stretch of the road towards fifty years of age, and the mother of two children, though, there was a lot in this movie I could relate to.

The story is pretty unique in the telling, but as with all good stories, it's the underlying messages that will touch. Sorry, no spoilers here... when I open my Christmas presents I prefer to BE suprised, rather than ACT suprised!
The technical aspects of the blu-ray are beyond reproach. Punchy, dazzling colors in almost every scene, crisp lines, no artifacts that I noticed... all around spectacular picture quality. And the sound is just as good - punchy, crisp and very well mixed. Dialogue was always came through cleanly, even in the noisiest scenes. Surround was immersive without being showy. Very cool.

The characters are rich in emotion and personality and the storyline is creative.

It is a must see movie for everyone and a great one to watch over and over.

The 4 Disc Combo Pack was a great deal for us. We do not currently own a Blu-Ray player but plan on getting one soon. The nice thing about this pack is that we have a DVD disk to use for now and the digital copy that went on my iPod.

7569634,5,B019A3QMJA,"This is an incredibly beautiful story and an amazing animation...for older children and children at heart!! The realistically portrayed devastation one feels as the world falls apart around you is so well done for the character of Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner). How he copes (or doesn't cope) is so believable. How he interacts with young Russell, and learns to believe in Life again, is heartwarming and real. The story is fascinating and touches that fantastic place in each of us who has that one special wish that maybe someday...

The antics of Dug, the talking Dog (Who can forget his sudden interjection of ""Squirrel!"") are hysterical and his devotion to his Master are so true to good dogs everywhere.  Russell's caring for and about Kevin - the bird that represents the great conflict in this tale - is so profound. Russell gives - and receives in return - unconditional love.

This is a story that will entertain young children with its balloons and animals and zany adventures. But it is truly a tale for older viewers that reaffirms all that is good; reinforces good memories but also encourages the letting go of past entrapments; and proclaims that it is always worth the risk to open our hearts to love and respect.

A wonderful story...one worth viewing again and again and again!!!",1260316800,,1296,4.850678733031674

This isn't the story of someone who was disappointed with his life or marriage, but someone who didn't get to fulfill every part of it.  My mom said to me when I was younger that life is what happens when you're making other plans.  Up understands that, and uses it to create a fantastic film, with loveable characters that I can watch again and again.  Pixar movies only seem to get better, and I can't say enough about this movie other than you need to see it.

Also, I very much liked that the blu ray included the dvd, and digital copy.

7569650,5,B019A3QMJA,"Aside from The Incredibles, I try not to get too judgemental about Pixar movies. Some of them like Wall-E which have dynamic animation, and others like Toy Story have a great story but might not be as visually appealing. Up manages to bring together both of these into a wonderful experience for the whole family, as well as for animation fans.

The movie starts out with the young Carl Fredrickson who is a fan of the famous explorer, Charles Muntz, and through this befriends a hick girl named Ellie. They later on marry, and keep planning for their own expedition, but as the years go by the burdens of ""real life"" makes their dream go unfulfilled, and Ellie eventually dies of old age. Carl is now an old man living in his and Ellie's old dream home, which is in danger of being bought out by a large construction company. So, being a longtime balloon salesman, Carl sticks hundreds of balloons to his house and flies it to South America in the hope of leaving it on the cliff at a place called Paradise Falls. The only hiccup in this is the chubby boy scout Russell was stranded on Carl's porch when it took off, and is now along for the ride. Once in South America, they land the house on the opposite end of the plataeau that the falls are located, so Carl and Russell have to carry the house still floating by balloons to the other end like a giant parade float. They encounter an exotic flightless bird, that Russell calls Kevin, which is being chased by dogs with special collars that allow them to talk. One of the dogs is Dug who quickly befriends them. The other dogs force them to where their owner is, who turns out to be Carl's childhood hero, Muntz. He's been there this whole time ruthlessly looking for a rare bird, which is what Kevin is. Carl and Russell barely escape with Kevin's help, but Kevin gets caught by Muntz's mutts. After finally getting the house to the falls, Russell leaves Carl to go rescue Kevin. Carl eventually decides to go to by flying his house after Muntz in his giant zepplin, and despite being in probably in his 80s, Carl manages to free Kevin and Russell with Dug's help. They then hijack the zepplin and head to the States.

Up was a pure delight. It took a brave move in making a senior citizen the main hero in a family adventure animated film. The first few minutes are very endearing, and really pulls you into this journey of Carl, and ultimately what he decides to do with himself now that he's nearing the end of his life.

7569666,5,B019A3QMJA,"I do not like grouchy old man. I do not like movie that toys with emotion. I do not like dogs. So I did not like the whole settings for this animation from the start. It took me a long time to even bother to watch this. And the first time, I watched here and there because of my 33 months old. He adores this movie. There are a lot of emotional ups and downs and my boy acts it out. He calls Russell baby and loves to follow what he says and how he acts. It is not an animation of 3 year old. But there is nothing that's out of ordinary that should be objected to. All are part of every day life that young and old has to confront. So far, Pixar has managed well mixing materials for young and old together well enough to be enjoyed by all groups. The Incredibles being the prime example. Story of middle aged man going through their mid-life crisis wrapped around comic characters that a whole family can enjoy. That's the mastery of Pixar's series. Younger ones that don't understand should be just ignoring the depths of the issues naturally and depth of the story is only unlocked as they ""understand"" the underlying story. That's mastery!

On the second viewing, all the details of the movie grab my attention and as usual all over the movie there were subtle mastery of story telling. The old man was genuine character, not something that someone just came up with. He was someone that most of us could associate with. Russell is also one of our boy and who I once was. With all the badges earned still unsure of oneself. Through all the bravery, weak and naive and so very much a child.

I see poor reviews of Pixar movies and they center around Pixar not being purely children's animation. I have a very strong objection to that type of idea. 1. I watch all Pixar movies with my boy ever since he was able to watch them. He chooses what he wants to watch. Toy Story 2, Cars, Up. I talk with him, tell him stuff. We don't quite communicate yet but he listens and ""appreciates"" the interaction. 2. Things like infertility, death and family issues, younger ones just don't understand and they will just skip those scenes naturally. It will be wrong to assume that 2-3 year old struggling with life and death and infertility questions. It's more likely the adults watching it has those questions they themselves haven't worked out with themselves. Deal with it. Pixar present them in best possible way.

UP is another gift by Pixar to humanity. Thank you, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Lasseter. This is a 175 million dollar gift from them to you. Enjoy it for $20!",1259539200,,2556,4.399577167019028

7569671,5,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" by Pixar continues the amazing run of animated movies this studio has put out.  Just when you think it will be impossible for Pixar to top themselves, they amaze you by surpassing their already lofty standards.  I thought the only slight stumble from Pixar was ""Ratatouille"", but then they release ""Wall*E"" and ""Up"".  ""Up"" may be the best animated film I've ever seen and is about as perfect an animated film as can be made.  Every aspect of ""Up"" is first-rate -- a wonderful story, incredible animation, great casting (yes, voice casting is critical and Ed Asner is wonderful) and a movie that delivers across a range of emotions that connect with adults and children.  I won't bother recapping the plot, plenty other have done that.

We have 3 children (5,7 & 10) and they all are equally mesmerized and entertained by this movie.  We all loved the movie when we saw it in the theaters and the Blu-ray version of ""Up"" does complete justice to the picture.  Watching this movie on a 52"" HDTV at home, while not up to theater standards, certainly is about as close to being in the theater as you can get.

Storytelling is an art form and we often take for granted how hard it is to create truly wonderful stories.  The folks at Pixar have spoiled us by making it appear too easy, constantly churning out movies that will be classics for generations, just like the old Disney animated movies.  If you have not seen ""Up"", do yourself a favor and buy a blu-ray player, or if you have one, then buy the blu-ray version of ""Up"" and treat yourself to a wonderful, hynotic and mesmerizing bit of storytelling.  It just doesn't get any better than this.",1259366400,2,1650,4.555932203389831
7569672,1,B019A3QMJA,"Some versions of the UP movies which are currently on the shelves of many stores do not have English subtitles or captions for the Deaf even though this is advertised on the case.  This is not typical of Disney to distribute movies of substandard quality and to allow false advertising.

About 10% of people in America rely on English captions/subtitles to be able to follow the movies comfortably.  By not including those captions/subtitles, Disney is denying a significant market from being able to equally enjoy the high quality Disney movies.  Since the typical Disney movies are meant to be watched by everyone in the family, certain family members will be left out of the family entertainment experience.

The right thing for Disney to do now is to offer a recall and DVD replacement with the audio and subtitles which were promised on the case.  Such actions will ensure the loyalty and respect of millions of Americans and continue Disney's commitment to diversity and inclusiveness.",1259366400,79,991,5.012195121951219
7569673,5,B019A3QMJA,"Few Movie companies have as good a track record as Pixar. With better story lines than most Hollywood dramas, Pixar never fails to impress and most of the time astound! 'Up' is a beautiful looking film with a very emotional theme and is probably a little too adult for the younger kids. Pixar leaves out the wisecracking side characters and adds depth to the story of an old man who loses his life partner and must find a way to keep on going. He decides to complete one of the many adventures he and his wife had planned for so many years, but like many of us never seemed to get to it. Yes!, it does sound a little too deep for an animated film, but animated films have come along way and if this is the direction they're headed that's fine by me!

The film has some of the most impressive animation ever done and the characters are, well.....almost real! Pixar hasn't really had a bad film and this is certainly among one of their best, but with winners such as Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, I'm not sure if this slightly downer is going to become a film to watch over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film and deserves a heap of credit trying to follow Wall-E, but with such an emotionally adult theme, I'm not sure who this film is targeted for?

The 4 disc Blu Ray is loaded with interesting extras and the usual standard DVD, digital copy blah, blah, blah, and is certainly one of the best Blu Ray releases I've seen so far.

This copy has four discs.  Two blu-rays discs (the film and the extras), a single DVD copy and a digital copy which is intended for ipod/computer etc. usage (this includes an activation number so just be aware of that if you are considering buying this used)

If you ever seen an animated film on blu-ray you already known they are amazing in detail.  The extras here really pleased me and that was a big factor in my 5 star award for this release.

You get ""Dugs Special Missions"" which is a new short that follows the misadventures of Dug the dog.  This is really cute and I think for children, Dug is a memorable character from the film.

You also get the short film ""Partly Cloudy"", now if you saw Up in the theater and got there on time, you might remember the short film about the unlucky cloud.  It's really a nice short film and I was  happy to know they included it here.

You also get the Making of Up and the Many Endings of Muntaz which are essentially alternate endings.  Now on the extra blu ray exclusive bonus disc you have:

Global Guardian Badge Game - this is a simply multiplayer geography game.
Married Life - is an extended character back story feature
8 All New Documentaries.  If you enjoy behind the scenes extras you will really like these.

The film fails in the end with its...(or film makers, as every animation movie is made from a lot of talented creative people) use or introduction of a VILLAIN!.  Kids I talked to say the same thing, the villain was not necessary, or the worse aspect of the film.  The movie would have been better paced out if they just found things from the Villain who should have been dead by then anyways(years???).  If they had the dogs acting as a pack, carrying out his wishes then maybe... Better yet they should have had the story focus on the jungle, and the goal of reaching Paradise Falls, using the jungle and the other animals as well hurdles.

Finding Nemo could be used as an example for its no usage of a true villain.  Nemo had obstacles, more than one villain. Or hurdles, where they overcome the best and worse of what the sea had to offer. No I don't think the girl and the dentist where villains. Wall-e was good too, Bolt was ok, Cars... villains are overrated unless they truly engulf the film... most of the fav villains have been from 2d classic movies(most are women?)... Monster House was a good sort of villain(again a woman). Monster Inc is good...

I hope the reason for the delay of Finding Nemo on BLU-RAY is that they plan to release it in 3D like Toy Story1 and 2.... I doubt it....",1259107200,9,1464,4.360294117647059

7569681,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar has a pretty good track record if you ask me.  Of their releases there is only one that I cannot stand (`Cars') but there are quite a few I consider absolutely wonderful (`Ratatouille', `The Incredibles') and one that I consider a near masterpiece (`Finding Nemo').  In my personal opinion, `Up' is the best thing they have ever done.  It is, quite frankly, a modern masterpiece in animated filmmaking.

Seriously.

The plot is pretty simple on the outset.  Carl Fredricksen (who looks an awful lot like Spencer Tracy) is a crotchety old widower who is holding onto the only memory he has of his departed wife; their home and a dream of adventure.  When circumstances shift, paving the way for Carl to be court ordered to a nursing home, he decides to try his hand at adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his roof and going up, up, up and away.  With a young stowaway named Russell, an overweight boy-scout of sorts, Carl sets off in hot pursuit of Paradise Falls, the land he and his beloved wife always dreamed of exploring.

Let's get one thing straight; this is a story about a floating house, so don't expect it to be realistic.  To those who pick apart plot holes such as ""where was Russell's mother this whole time"" and the like, sure it isn't realistic, but are you really expecting it to be?

One thing I will agree on is that this is a very sad and dramatic film that may not be suitable for all children.  I do feel that it may be good for children who face similar situations as Russell to see their home life displayed in a sweetly appealing setting like the one presented in this animated film, but I do also feel that some subjects discussed may be too deep or even unsettling at times for young ones.  It was choking me up.  Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to themes such as the inability to have children (or it possibly could have been a miscarriage) and the death of a spouse.  Themes such as single parent families and neglect come into play as well, and the ending, which is sweet, is also laced with sadness.

The film will make you smile and laugh, but it will make you cry A LOT.

With that solitary caution (it does tend to get very violent towards the end as well, and with attacks made on a child I find that it may be a concern to a parent) I have to say that this is a very, very, very good movie; great even.  No, better than great; it is a MASTERPIECE.  The animation is stellar, the concept is original and engaging, the humor is strong and the gags are all on point, fresh and welcome.  For me, it was nice to see such strong emotional themes explored in this context.  It adds a different layer to the general consensus of dramatic entertainment.  Sure, this is no where near as gritty or as overwhelming as `Grave of the Fireflies', but `Up' allows the humor to play a perfect balance to the mature point of view this film is taking.

There are very few animated films that can handle both sides of the spectrum with such grace and eloquence.",1259107200,3,3005,4.394213381555153
7569682,2,B019A3QMJA,"I bought the UP Blu-ray 4 disc version just so I could have the SD DVD with English subtitles.  I had the NetFlix version of UP and it had no subtitles or closed captioning.  Neither version plays on my computer and both versions are programmed to start with coming attractions.  The copy protection on these Disney DVDs is similar to the Sony DVD copy protection on many of its DVD releases at the start of 2007, movies like Casino Royale and The Pursuit of Happyness.  Then, Sony admitted that about 25 million of its movie DVDs used copy protection software that prevented many DVD players from playing the DVDs.  Disney will never admit it is selling DVDs crippled by defective copy protection software. Nor will Disney acknowledge that it is shortchanging customers by not putting Spanish or French language tracks or closed captioning on some of its new SD DVD releases.

7569683,3,B019A3QMJA,"Another commendable, 4-star outing from Pixar.
The DVD packaging is another matter. There have been many complaints about the computer-incompatibility, but my gripe is about the ""pecking order"" for those that want the single-disc DVD vs. the 4-disc Blu-ray and everything in-between.
Time was when you bought a 2-disc set of a Pixar film, you got hours worth of neat, entertaining and enlightening extras (example: the exhaustive Super Heroes guide with ""The Incredibles""). By the time ""Cars"" came out, you could only get a single-disc version with very few extras. ""Ratatouille"": same story. ""Wall-E"" somewhat rectified the situation with the available 3-disc version, which did have generous bonuses - if you shelled out the bucks, that is. ""Up"" has the most deceptive packaging of all: a bare-bones single-disc version (you just want the movie and a lot of promos? You got it!), the ""deluxe"" DVD version (which Amazon/Disney advertise as a ""Two-Disc Deluxe Edition + Digital Copy"", which can imply there are three discs [there are not], and there are certainly NOT ""hours of new bonus! [sic]"", as the slip-sleeve boasts), and a 4-disc Blu-ray version for those fortunate enough to own that format. Disney is obviously hard-balling the recession-weary public into buying Blu-ray players and their inflated-priced discs and punishing those who are scraping by with an archaic DVD.
What would have been nice is an extras-packed double-DVD w/o the digital copy (I don't know anybody who really uses this), a better-valued single-DVD version and maybe even a single-Blu-ray.
The release date for a Pixar movie used to be an event. Now it's a downer, waiting to see how Disney rips its faithful public off again.",1259020800,89,1709,5.1732851985559565

7569686,4,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is an oddly incongruous film from Pixar in that it has primarily adult themes but a relatively simple visual style and an over-the-top adventure plot. Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) is an elderly widower who had always dreamed with his wife Ellie of far-flung adventures. In particular, they wanted to visit ""Paradise Falls"" in South America, where their childhood hero, an adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), made his name. Before he is forced into a retirement home, Carl takes one last shot at his dream. He attaches about 20,000 helium balloons to his house, hoists some sails, and sets the house aloft. But Carl has an unintended guest: an boy named Russell (Jordan Nagai), overeager to get his Wilderness Explorer ""Helping the Elderly Badge"", is on the porch.

Carl and Russell have only a few days to deposit the house atop Paradise Falls before the balloons deflate. The boy's idealism and enthusiasm clash with Carl's sense of urgency. Russell befriends a giant bird and a talking dog named Dug (Bob Petersen) but cannot understand Carl's increasing desperation. Carl is an old man who feels the pressure of very limited time to fulfill his life's dream, and at first he doesn't' have much patience with Russell's cheerful but easily distracted temperament. Now, this is entertaining to watch, but how much would a child understand or care about Carl's problem? ""Up"" does not limit its appeal to children, as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"" did, but I wonder if it has not done the opposite and taken on themes that are irrelevant to children.

I hope this will not spoil the movie for anyone, but I feel compelled to mention the strangest thing about this film: There is a man living in the jungle who is right out of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". He is worshiped and served by a group of violent primitives (in this case domesticated dogs), and he collects the heads (in this case helmets) of those who have dared trespass his little fiefdom, whom we assume he has killed. He's an intelligent, accomplished man whose mind has gone `round the bend. He's Kurtz. Should I be surprised to see a Kurtz character in a ""family film""? There is nothing graphic about ""Up"", and I don't think this guy is any scarier than a typical Pixar villain. ""Up"" is an entertaining film, though it lacks the visual interest and innovation that I've come to expect from Pixar (it was intended to be shown in 3D). I just wonder what children will make of it.",1258934400,,2467,4.788732394366197
7569687,5,B019A3QMJA,"My box set arrived today and luckily despite Amazon's deplorable packaging it arrived in good condition.
The lamp, which is attached to a plastic base or platform feels a bit cheap to the touch and is made from a plastic composite.
Having said that once adjusted and placed on the shelf it looks spectacular.
As mentioned in previous reviews it runs on four AA size batteries and seems to be lit via small leds. It omits a soft glow rather than a harsh light (were you to use a conventional globe).
The base also houses a handy adjustable shelf which you can slot your various blu-ray cases.
It's larger than I envisioned and despite the cheap Chinese build, it's a centrepiece that I'm sure will impress all that view it (just don't let anyone play with it).

As long as you can purchase this and pick it up (would not take the risk with shipping) I would recommend it and if you are a big Pixar fan this item is the ultimate keepsake.
Just like their movies which evoke emotion, this item will bring a smile to your face every time you glimpse it.

As far as the movie itself is concerned I can't really add anything that has already been stated in all the sterling reviews that have been posted however I will add that when I went and saw this at the cinemas some families left due to the high emotional response that their children had to some events throughout the movie. I don't want to give anything away but there were at least two points in the movie where children actually started to cry!

Something parents need to be aware of is that this Pixar offering is designed to be an emotional ride for the senses and that some children may not be fully equipped to deal with this at a tender age. It may definitely warrant a discussion on life after the credits have rolled. Not necessarily a bad thing.",1258934400,,1808,4.407185628742515
7569688,5,B019A3QMJA,"It has been said plenty a time before, but...well...the folks at Disney and Pixar have done it again. ""Up"" is, perhaps, their most charming, touching, and exciting animated feature yet - at least in my opinion. If there is a fulfilling movie for all the family, this is surely one. ""Up"" comes in a fabulous package that includes both Blue Ray and DVD copies of the film, plus a Digital Copy.

Early in the film, we meet young Carl Fredricksen, who dreams of embarking on an adventure trip to South America, just like his hero, Charles Muntz, a famous adventurer.  Carl meets young Ellie, who also has the same dreams and aspirations. Carl makes a living by selling balloons, and eventually falls in love, gets married to and ages together with Ellie. Unfortunately, they are not able to realize their dream of going to Paradise Falls, in South America, due to lack of money. Sadly, Ellie passes away due to old age, and Carl is left alone in the house that he shared with his one and only love. Some time after this sad episode, Russell, a young explorer, knocks at his door. He claims that he needs to get a badge for assisting an elderly person, so that he can earn the title of Senior Wilderness Explorer. After being pestered by Russell for a while, Carl agrees to help him, and gives him some work at his yard.

One day, just when Carl is about to be forced to move to a retirement home, he attaches thousands of balloons to the foundation of his house, creates his own makeshift blimp,  and flies away, to everyone's surprise. He doesn't realize that Russell was at the porch of his home by the time his house took off. Initially angry at the kid, Carl unwillingly accepts his uninvited guest on his trip. After some time, too, Carl learns about the need of love that Russell had, and takes him under his umbrella. Together they will embark on an unforgettable journey, which will include storms, exotic wildlife, talking dogs, and in which they will meet an unexpected ghost from the past.

""Up"" is a beautiful and colorful movie, with great, true values and feelings. It's about life, aging, death, and friendship, and I'm very sure that it will reach your heart and the best of you. This fascinating set includes four discs. Disc One is the Blue Ray with the feature film, plus extras, like the theatrical short ""Partly Cloudy,"" alternate scenes, a making-of documentary, and more. Disc Two is another Blue Ray, loaded with more extras, such as a multilayered geography game, eight documentaries, and much more. On the other hand, Disc Three is a DVD copy of the film, also containing some extras. Lastly, Disc Four contains a digital copy of the film. Released November 10, 2009.

Both the quality of their productions and the excellence of their scripts stand out among animated films.  I particularly loved this one because it shatters all previous templates for what a film is supposed to be about.  The main protagonist is a 78-year-old man who bears a resemblance to to Spencer Tracy and his main traveling companion is a young, rotund Asian boy scout.  Along the way they acquire a delightfully absurd and gigantic bird and a talking dog (while I saw this film I was reading Clifford D. Simak's CITY, which features several talking dogs, so for a while talking dogs were a motif in my cultural life).  All of this while attempting to relocate a house carried by thousands of helium-filled balloons to a mythical spot in South America called Paradise Falls.  And the entire affair was prefaced by a story within the story, of the story of Carl and Ellie's long life together.

I've yet to see a Pixar movie that wasn't a complete delight.  And as for the appropriateness for small children, I would not hesitate to show it to one.  I think a child will find it entertaining, moving, and inspiring.

Production is superb, and the opening segment, showing us Carl's life with his beloved Ellie, is touching and true-to-life.  Once the main story begins, however, things spin slightly out of control; as with all Pixar movies, there's a lot of action for action's sake, even if it doesn't always make sense.

I agree with other reviewers that some of the themes might be too grown-up for very young and/or sensitive children...hence, the PG rating. (For the record, I think it's unfair to hold it against the film-makers if your very young child was upset...those ratings are given for a reason.

7569699,5,B019A3QMJA,"I have never reviewed a Pixar film on Amazon just yet, but their 10th feature `Up' had to be. Pixar, since Toy Story has spit out one hit after another bringing a whole new generation of legendary Disney Characters. While every single one of them has been incredible `Up' just stands out because it is unlike any of its Pixar predecessors.

This is the second film from Pixar to be given a PG rating since The Incredibles. While The Incredibles was more based around comic books and superhero action the first few minutes of Up are very adult oriented. There are extremely real elements that lead us to the main characters adventure, but the previous one he had was real life. It is a beautiful sequence with no dialogue, but a score to show a husband and wife sharing the happy times and the devastating ones, one of them being the loss of a loved one. Even with no words it is so heartfelt and full of emotion it is just something that a young audience might not understand and the scene where Carl assaults a construction worker is also a moment that is very hard to explain to a very young person. After that the story changes gears to a rip roaring hysterical adventure. The cast works so well together especially bringing two legends in Edward Asner and Christopher Plumber. Everyone will love Russell, the eager young explorer who seeks adventure, but there is also more depth to this character that again reflects real live issues such as parent separation. Of course there is pure Disney magic in this film especially in the animals. This time when there are talking dogs, `Up' uses technology to make them speak instead of a traditional imaginative talking animal. That was a stroke of genius making is actually believable that someone can create a device to make an animal speak and still keep its own natural characteristics.

Up may be the best Pixar film to date although I love each and every one of them, this just stands out as a story that was trying to get as real as it could. I do feel that if someone tied that many balloons to a house it could fly. So find a way to see this film it will truly lift your spirits and melt your heart.

7569704,5,B019A3QMJA,"First, a review in regards to the Blu-Ray quality. As expected, the picture and audio quality is astounding. More so made by the fact that it was terribly projected when I first saw this film in the cinema. Can't see it was an optimal presentation, nevertheless, the picture projection in cinemas have been disappointments of late. This BD puts every non-digital projection cinema to shame. If this edition has 3D capabilities, this would be the final nail in the coffins of cinema projection. The audio quality is superb. Dialouge is clear and even my most favourite moments where the soundtrack hums softly (especially in the bittersweet opening), it is subtle and poignant.

Without reiterating the plot, this movie is one of the best films of this year. Beats Transformers 2 right out of the block. I couldn't even imagine how on earth TF2's gross could beat this similarly box office friendly film. I guess good clean and well-intentioned fun is out of the question for today's kids. You don't get to see a senior citizen as a protagonist in any movies that often nowadays. The last time someone has done something revolutionary like that was David Lynch, who made 'A Straight Story'. A poignant bittersweet film about redemption and gaining back one's soul and heart from a senior citizen's perspective.",1258502400,,1309,4.95

the movie is awesome!!!
super cute and funny great for kids and cartoon lovers.
great quality on the PlayStation. blah blah blah..

Cons
My 4 disc combo was missing the DVD copy or disc 3 listed on the back of the set..
Amazon is cool and sending me another one hopefully it come with a disc 3...
why is this a problem because it supposed to come with it and i was planning on giving the DVD copy to my nephew and niece...

Our 2 year old son was in tears for much of the movie, upset with what was happening, and I am pretty sure not understanding the underlying story.  Some of the violence was a bit too much, with the villian shooting at the kid at one point.

They never gave any indication that the movie was very sad and heart-wrenching. I didn't expect it to be so sad. Not to mention that the villain was a little creepy.  That part may be a little scary for some kids.  The dogs were very anoying and so was the bird. Parents may have some explaining to do during and after this movie (death, cancer, grief, miscarriage, why the villain is shooting at a kid). I'm not saying I didn't like the movie.  I did.  But I think Disney could have marketed it differently. I think parents should view it with their small children.  It's a very sad movie with a happy ending, but the events may be a little to difficult for small children to understand.
The animation was fantastic. But the story left a little to be desired.",1258416000,5,938,4.381502890173411
7569709,5,B019A3QMJA,"I saw this film in its first week of release in the theaters and with a sizable audience.  The laughs were plentiful (""Squirrel!"") and the entire experience very enjoyable.

Problem is, can that experience be duplicated watching it at home on DVD or Blu-Ray?  Mostly, but not entirely.

The laughs are still there but not as hearty as you get in a theater full of people watching it for the first time.

Visually, ""Up"" is stunning - as one expects from Pixar.

The 4-disc Blu-Ray combo pack provides so much value-added material that it would be a bargain at twice the price.  Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, buy the Blu-Ray combo pack version because you get the regular DVD anyway and you will have all that bonus material IN CASE you ever buy a BR player.  Duh.

I don't consider this to be Pixar's best movie.  I liked ""Wall*E"" and ""The Incredibles"" just a bit more.  But ""Up"" easily ranks as one of the best movies of 2009 and does the Pixar legacy proud.",1258416000,,973,4.410112359550562

The movie starts out great and appears that it will be a fun and sensitive look into a life lived, goals planned for but postponed and sharing love through it all. Unfortunately I think that about 2/3 the way through the movie the Disney execs walked in and said ""this is too boring, only old people will appreciate this and our target audience is the 8 year old male. Put more stupidity in and be sure to have lots of bodily fluids, 8 year old males love bodily fluids, I mean look what it does for Dreamworks!"". So the chance is missed, what could have been a great movie that would be treasured for years ends up just another piece of tripe. THe ironic thing is that no 8 years old will be happy sitting through the first part of the movie and no adult will like the last part of the movie. One can only hope that this is an aberration in an otherwise stellar path for Pixar. One can only dread that the DIsney marketing and audience research experts have taken over Pixar and all we will see going forward is more tripe.

7569713,3,B019A3QMJA,"A wonderful short film stretched into a two hour movie. Bigger ain't always better.

The first part is moviemaking at its best and a milestone in animation. The two minute depiction of a lifetime marriage is a class act in itself: moving storytelling without a word spoken. Audiences the world over mellow and cry; why shoudn't they? Whereas, the scene when the balloons burst out and the house takes flight constitutes the film's showstopper, meaning not only that it's the most spectacular, but that it marks the emotional conclusion of the story, and should have ended it right there. For beyond that point, the sentimental balloon can only deflate and go down.

Two minor gripes on the descent:

Supposedly, once you buy the idea of a balloon flying house, anything goes. It does not. Talking dogs that fly planes can extract a laugh or two, but they totally wreck the mood created so far. It's like matching a Magritte with ""Dogs Playing Poker"" (a painting lampooned in the movie, by the way) on the basis that they're both surreal images. Not so. One pertains a subtle magic that's incompatible with the other's bold crassness.

Second, I don't quite get the villain. Sort of an airborne Captain Nemo; a discredited, embittered mad genius bent on vindication, if not revenge. In an obvious nod to both Verne and Disney, Muntz's art-deco zeppelin resembles Nemo's lavish Nautilus. Yet the man ought to be a centennial old geezer by now, instead of the silverhaired swasbuckling fiend that comes up with talking devices for dogs but can't catch a giant peacock that only requires a bite of chocolate. That's another thing: people who love nature and adventure tend to grow happy and wise as they get older. Would anyone kill an endangered bird, let alone shoot a kid, after a lifetime of experiencing nature's wonders? Sorry, doesn't click.

At long last, the movie ends as it should: the house arrives at the falls, the boyscout earns his badge, and the old man reacquaints himself to life. Lovely film that should have followed its own moral: in life, as in balloons and movies, one has to drop dead weight in order to soar.",1258329600,25,2130,4.79291553133515
7569714,5,B019A3QMJA,"Based on previews I expected ""Up"" to be another very funny, quality movie from Pixar; however, when I sat down to watch it I got that and much more. It starts sweet with the main character, Carl, as a little boy meeting Ellie, a little girl who shares his desire for adventure and admiration of the explorer Muntz. Carl and Ellie get married and move into the abandoned house where they met. Ellie painted a picture of living in the house beside the big waterfall in the lost valley where Muntz had traveled. As they grow old together they save for this dream only to use the money for other needs as they arise.

The movie turns sad when Ellie passes away and Carl is almost forced into living at a retirement home. To avoid giving up the house, Carl uses an abundance of balloons (doubtlessly saved up from his work selling them) to lift his house off the ground, intending to sail it to that lost valley in South America. Carl soon discovers Russell, a young scout who was trying to earn his last merit badge by helping the old man, accidentally came along for the ride. The two go on an adventure which sees them encounter a rare bird species, a pack of talking dogs, and the adventurer Muntz.  Along the way Carl ends up making some hard choices, such as choosing between fulfilling his and Ellie's dream and rescuing the rare bird. In the end, Russell and Carl each provide something the other needs - Russell needing a father figure and Carl needing a new adventure and purpose.

There are lots of humorous scenes throughout, my favorite being when Carl and Russell first encounter Dug, one of the dogs who can talk via special collars. But it's the story of Carl and Ellie which makes it so much more than a funny cartoon. Even with relatively little screen time and dialog, the scenes where their relationship unfolds are very moving, like any good movie love story. You feel it when Ellie passes away and you understand Carl's motivations afterward. By the end, the movie will have you laughing and crying.",1258329600,2,2016,4.548209366391185

7569717,5,B019A3QMJA,"First off I just want to say that I was not an animated movie collector, being mainly watching it when I used to take my little cousin to the movies on the weekends.
However, Blu-ray have really revolutionized the animated movie industry with its clarity (no movie ""artifacts"" and digital noise - ""digitizations"" - whatsoever since it's not shot on film and is not compressed like with regular DVDs).
If there is anything that Blu-ray was meant to do, it's to watch animated movies (and I mean these recent CG animation ones, and not those that were made 60 years ago!).
So now I am proud to claim that I am an avid HD animated movie collector.

And ""Up"" is one such movie that deserves to be in your collection.
This review isn't about any technical aspects (quality of transfer, DVD vs. Blu-ray, etc.).
I just want to say that the opening montage (I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it) is one of the most poignant in animation movie history. It's so touching I thought I was watching an Oscar-nominated drama.
This love/bond is the backbone of the movie, and carries and ties it all together.
This is a movie the children will enjoy, but adults will treasure it too.
Pixar has really revolutionized its story-telling with this masterpiece, and they deserve to be commended.

PS- it would be awesome if Pixar made a dramatic ""short"" that tells more about the old couple's love through time. But since this is supposed to be a kid's animated movie I guess that's asking too much. Although the including shorts are wonderful, especially ""Partly Cloudy.""",1258329600,,1562,4.676363636363637
7569718,1,B019A3QMJA,"This is a complaint against Disney/Pixar and a warning to buyers related SOLELY to the 1 disc DVD edition and NOT to the film itself -- which is 5* brilliant.

I do not have an HDTV or a BluRay player and have no intent to get one.  When I looked at the three versions of UP there was BluRay, the 1 disc and a 2 disc version which cost $12 more for a ""free"" digital copy.  Since I didn't need that, I was happy to buy the 1 disc version assuming they were the same thing less digital.  WRONGO!!!

When I got it home I discovered the 1 disc version is as bare bones as they come.

NO booklet(!), NO DVD commentary(!), NO outtakes(!)...in fact the only extras are Dug's Adventure and the Pixar short about the stork and the cloud (which is adorable and reminded me of Dumbo's Mr Stork).  I know Disney is all about the Benjamins, but still I cannot believe that Disney/Pixar is so cheap that they couldn't bother releasing all the DVD extras to ALL editions of this film as they used to do.  Why should I have to buy a 2 disc version with a ""free"" digital copy of the film when I don't need one just to get the rest of the extras?

Not sure what my advice to you would be except to say if you want the whole package and don't have BluRay player, I guess you gotta spring for the 2 disc + digital version.  Bad form Disney/Pixar...very bad form indeed.",1258243200,52,1349,4.134099616858237

Carl and Ellie are adventurers.  They meet, fall in love, marry, and life happens in such a way that they are unable to live their dreams.  When Carl snatches the opportunity to finally live the adventure, he reluctantly befriends Russell and Dug, meets the hero of his childhood, and learns that life itself is the real adventure.

7569722,5,B019A3QMJA,"A wonderful movie for all the family.  The story has something for everyone, comedy, adventure, deep emotional sense, and beautiful Pixar animation.

Ed Asner is the perfect voice for the 78 year old balloon Salesman, Carl Fredricksen. Carl is the main character.

The first part of the movie is fresh and moving as the the young Carl's life is told through what seems like an album of photos with the final pictures of his wife passing away.  But now we see him as an old curmudgeon thinking he will hold on to the home he and Ellie shared.  Progress is outside his door; buildings are built around him and his home is condemned.

At this point, a young boy, Russell, (cute, tubby, Wilderness Explorer) comes into Carl's life.  He knocks at Carl's door and Russell opens many doors for Carl with his optimism and bold ideas.  Russell needs to get a task of helping the elderly done for an award.  The story becomes fun and crazy as Carl, Russell and the house take off with thousands of helium balloons carrying the load.

The winds blow the balloon hefted home to South America where many adventures and challenges face the strange pair.  You can't help but laugh at the crazy characters and cheer when Carl at age 78, finally lives his dream.

All of the above depends on how you're treated by those who care for you. A lovely film, lots of action, and lots of love. I enjoyed it very much.  Some DVD extras are good.

Okay, I had to make that point, no onto the review.  I have a 3 year old, so we still buy a lot of DVDs and don't waste money on Blu-Ray purchases, but do rent them on occasion.  I can tell you I was blown away with the vivid colors in this film on Blu-Ray, it is simply AMAZING!

Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation.  This is another example of that.

The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning.  I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes.  From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny (and it's cheaper here at Amazon) to anyone who appreciates art.

By the way, this is not ""a funny cartoon"" but a suspenseful and sentimental adventure story, with a few laughs along the way. I would think adults would like this more than kids.

7569728,5,B019A3QMJA,"Pixar movies are like kids and parents.  You love 'em all.  But Up has a wonderful moral that sets it apart.

Carl Fredrickson is a curmudgeonly 78 year old widower weighed down by a broken promise made to his deceased wife Ellie when they were children to take her to the faraway Paradise Falls discovered by their hero, explorer Charles Muntz, in a baloon.

If there has ever been a character like Ellie in cinema, I've never seen her.  An adventurous tomboy that grows up into a lovely young lady and loving wife to Carl.  It's impossible not to fall in love with her.  And though most of her time onscreen is a wordless montage of her life with Carl at the beginning of the film, you'll miss her the rest of the movie, just as Carl does.

When commercial development forces him out of his shell following Ellie's death, Carl keeps his promise to Ellie, taking off in their home, lifted by thousands of helium-filled baloons to South America and Paradise Falls.  Along the way, an inconvienent stoway--a fellow wounded soul, 8 year old boy-scout Russell--inadvertantly teaches Carl (with the help of a wonderful message left by Ellie) the wonderful, life affirming lesson that what matters in life is having each other.  Russell draws the fun Carl out of curmudgeonly Carl, and you can see the man Ellie fell in love with, and understand why she considered her life with him all she ever needed.

Amazingly, the movie itself tracks this theme.  Though it's all entertaining, and has its excitement, what you'll remember most is the montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the time Carl and Russell spend together, respectively filling the holes in their lives left by loved ones.

Dog lovers will appreciate Dug, a dog that Carl and Russell meet along the way that can talk with the aid of a specialized collar. Any dog owner that's ever wondered what their persistently happy (albeit easily distracted--Squirrel!!) dog is thinking will thank Pixar for explaining.

Kids will love it, but it's adults that will (hopefully) get the message.

The Blu Ray 4 disc edition contains some extras:

Partly Cloudy--Everyone knows where babies come from...storks!  Partly Cloudy explains where storks get them.

A ""Dug"" Short--Wouldn't have fit in the movie, but I'm glad it's on the DVD.

Both of these are on the regular edition of the DVD, but Up should be seen in Blu Ray.

There's a nice backstory to the Married Life montage of Carl and Ellie's life together.  It's interesting to see what made it and didn't make it from the original storyboards.  Maybe I was prejudiced by the movie, because I saw it first, but I'm glad the evolution of ideas led Pixar to what's in the film.",1258156800,,2683,4.724731182795699

I have loved everything Pixar has done and after they made a really great movie about a rat that can cook, I decided I would never ever doubt Pixar's storytelling power again.

Visually the blu-ray is amazing, the sound is excellent. But of course what really shines is the touching story of an old man that was never able to re-visit the vacation spot that he and his wife have always wanted to visit. Pixar has an amazing ability to make mature stories that adults can enjoy and relate to, but tell them in such a way that kids enjoy them as well.

On the surface a ""kids"" movie that centers on a senior citizen is not a kid's cup of tea so to speak. But the characters are so well developed, better than most live action movies by the way. If you missed this movie in the theater, I would add it to your collection immediately. It's my first Disney Blu-Ray and it was well worth it!",1258070400,,1428,4.238970588235294

7569735,1,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is a great movie, I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately they've crippled the DVD with some new form of DRM that prevents it being played on many computers.  I have bought and returned three DVDs so far and every one fails to play because Disney locks the movie up with a DRM.  Think about this for a moment.  I pay for the DVD, I now own the DVD, but because Disney has convinced themselves that I, the customer, can not be trusted they rig up the DVD, which I bought, so I can't watch it.

I am not alone in this.  When I was in the store returning one of the non-playing DVDs there were four other customers doing the same and all with the same complaint: it will not play on a computer.

Again I recommend ""Up,"" it's a great movie.  Too bad I can't buy a DVD and watch it.",1257984000,138,780,4.0855263157894735
7569736,5,B019A3QMJA,"With all the wonderful films that Pixar has produced over the years, it takes a special film to stand out among the others. Up is that film. I wasn't sure what to make of the preview, which featured this grumpy old man sitting on a porch of a floating house held aloft by thousands of baloons. The film is so much more than that. It's rediscovering the adventure of life when you think there's nothing left. The opening montage, which shows how two people meet, marry, and grow old together, is perfect. You understand how this old man is the way he is. The adventure begins when his home is threatened by urban development, and his ingenious and original way of dealing with it. Ed Asner is the absolute perfect choice for Mr. Frederickson, and all the voice actors are spot-on with their roles. The speaking dogs are wonderful, and how they speak is a refreshing take on how to portray talking animals. The visuals are stunning, which is what we've come to expect from Pixar, but these are exceptional. The attention to detail is down-to-the-minute-detail. I saw this film in 3D at the theater, which was an experience, and I maust say there really isn't anything lost in viewing it in regular play. The sound is just right, without over-whelming the voice tracks, which happens a LOT in movies anymore. You know what I mean; you're listening hard to catch the dialogue then get blow out the back wall by an explosion or gunfire. I didn't get that in this film. All in all, this film is one of Pixar's finest, and that says everything.",1257984000,,1537,4.572463768115942
7569737,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up is by far my favorite Pixar movie. WHen I saw it in digital 3D, I was excited but also very doubtful, because I was unsure of whether or not Disney would be able to reach the heights that they did with ""WALL-E"". But I walked out of the theater totally amazed! It is indeed Pixar's best film yet, even better than WALL-E.

Yesteday I bought this at HMV. When I got home, I watched the movie and then explored the features.

SOUND QUALITY: 5/5: This edition has what most blu-rays lack nowadays- reak ooomph. You can feel it when the house ascends from the ground! The score is vivified here too, almost in a way that the score plays a real charater in the film. The subwoofer and back speakers create a sense of surrounding too- something that makes you feel like you're in it.

PICTURE: Infinite/5- This may just have the best picture quality for the Blu-Ray format. WALL-E and Bolt were both deemed to be the best Blu-Ray releases, but this one beats them put of the park. No grain, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, just perfect. No complaints about the picture at all! The Boosted-Up colors in ""WALL-E"" looked great, but this movie takes on a more natural look, whereas they still srike you. The montage looked great, but what looked the best were the scenes in Muntz's blimp.

EXTRAS: 4/5- They were pretty good extras, but this didn't need to have two discs- a lot of the features could easily fit on one disc. That said, they're still cool. The alternate endings one was really cool, the game was a fun play, and the documentaries were worth watching for sure.

TOTAL: 5/5- Do get this Blu-Ray. You will not regret it!",1257984000,,1628,4.486486486486487
7569738,5,B019A3QMJA,"I'm not an aficionado on animated films and, truth be told, I rarely watch them. With that said, I have not seen every Pixar film, but I can tell you there's never been one I didn't like. Whenever I end up watching one I'm stunned at how many levels it succeeds on as a motion picture and it's probably not a bold statement to imply that Pixar is the most consistently reliable animation studio.

The film's opening is an achievement in the animated medium simply for the emotional response it evokes from it's viewers with stark simplicity. Carl Fredericksen and Ellie meet as children, brought together by their mutual yearning for adventure. The story of their entire relationship concluding with her death is told using no words and is handled more poignantly than it would have been in many live-action films. Carl (now voiced by Ed Asner), a balloon salesman, adjusts to life without Ellie wandering his home without purpose and frequently annoyed by the construction occurring right outside. After city officials decide to place Carl in a nursing home, he attaches a great number of balloons to his house and begins steering his floating house to Paradise Falls, a place Ellie and himself had for years dreamed of going. Of course, Russell, a young, nave Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""help a Senior citizen"" badge is standing on the porch of the floating house.

The story picks up steam upon their landing, where they discover a rare bird (nick-named Kevin by Russell) that begins following them. Problem is there's a group of mysterious dogs with collars allowing them to speak tracking the bird. One of these dogs is Dug, a marvelous creation courtesy of Pixar. Dug, the comic relief of this film is an adorable, funny, sympathetic character in a film that already has more memorable characters than just about any film this year.

Up is such an impressive film. It uses none of the animated film-clichs; there is no adult innuendo, no clichd, mass-produced characters. It's geared towards children, but will appeal to all audiences because it's really a quality film. It has truly human characters that are emotionally complex and funny. The fact that Pixar continues to create characters that are both human and sympathetic is more of an achievement in animation than 3D is.

With a beautifully vivid color palette and inspired voice work by Asner, Jordan Nagai (as Russell), Bob Peterson (as Dug), and Christopher Plummer (as the film's antagonist, you'll know about him when you see the film), Up is one of those films that makes it unfortunate the Academy has a Best Animated Film category. It will more than likely win this award come Oscar-time, but Up isn't just one of the best animated films of the year it's one of the best films of the year. It succeeds on so many levels that animated films should not and most live-action films do not. It's a great animated film, yes but also just a great film, period; A stunning achievement on all levels.

GRADE: A",1257984000,3,2985,4.810916179337232
7569739,4,B019A3QMJA,Not the best from Pixar but head and shoulders above Cars & Wall-E sorry but characters must have a pulse for me to have any interest in them.

In Blu the animation as usual from Pixar is beautiful the short from Pixar and extras that came in the 4 disk set helped make the 20 bucks well worth it.,1257984000,,409,3.9397590361445785

7569741,3,B019A3QMJA,"I know I will probably be critizised for this review since everyone else thinks this movie was genius and I don't, but frankly I don't care. Let's review.

The Movie: The previews for this movie didn't grab my attention right away like the ones for Monsters Vs Aliens, Ice Age 3, and other awesome summer movies. But when everyone kept saying how great this movie was, I was pulled into the hype and rented it. I originally thought this movie would be another dissapointment just like the last two Disney movies I saw (Bolt (SUCKED!) and Walle (Okay)), but surprisingly, it wasn't. This movie had it's moments, and like everyone said, the animation was amazing (even if they still can't make humans as good as Dreamworks). This movie entertained me, but not as much as the two awesome movies I mentioned before that I saw this summer. It had a fairly good plot, and it did make me tear up a little bit. It was a good movie, but not as good as say Cars, Ratatouille, or Monsters Inc. Those are Pixar classics, this is just a good movie. I'd give the movie a 7.5, maybe an 8, out of ten. It's definately worth seeing once.

The Dvd: OMG. The DVD starts out with an ad from Pixar. Not just a movie preview or an ad for other movies, but an actual ad! It's just some bs from a bunch of Pixar workers saying how you should get the two disc dvd, the toys, games and books based on this movie, and a bunch of other crap. They're basically saying ""You won't have fun with this dvd, go out and spend more money on the two disc dvd just so you can actually have some bonus features). Nice job Pixar (sarcasm). Speaking of which, this dvd has NOTHING! It doesn't just have no bonus features it had no menu what so ever. I couldn't believe it when the dvd went from previews to the movie in two seconds with no warning what so ever. There's no menu, which means if you need captions, a different language, or you need to go straight to a scene, you're basically screwed if you buy this dvd! No menu?! Come on Pixar, or were you two busy making sellout commercials to make a menu?!

Overall: The movie was good, but do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this crappy, no menu dvd! It's crappy, and it's only worth the rental price of $4, maybe not even that! Pixar, do you really think you can make people buy your two disc dvds just so they can get a basic menu?! Not cool!

Movie: 7.5/10
Dvd: 0/10 (stay away from it! Just watch the movie on youtube!)",1257897600,5,2429,4.262472885032538

Thankfully, they are different than the rest.  They come up with original ideas.

Beautiful animation.

A disappointment-NO GOOD MUSIC.  Remember when Disney films had good music/songs?  Sure miss those days.  Memorable songs?  Oscar winning songs?  Those were the days.

This has the digital copy.  Good idea, but I would like to see some different extras like Disney used to.  More information on the film, showing more in depth stuff.

NO chapter list, you just do NOT get these anymore & I want them.

And, Disney/Pixar, why the horrible flip the little flap DVD case/holder?  Now, I looked at the single disc DVD & IT DID NOT HAVE THIS HORRIBLE FEATURE, SO WHY DOES THE MORE EXPENSIVE HAVE THIS.  Hate them.

And, the Ellie character.  Did the younger, adult Ellie not look like Helen from The Incredibles?",1257897600,,859,4.888111888111888

Honestly, it was so refreshing to see a cartoon where the veiled adult directed humor wasn't something my 4 year old could pick up on. Not to mention all the blatant NON vulgar kid's humor. Hollywood, lately, seems to think our children don't get real humor and instead have to be bombarded with gross jokes to make them laugh.

7569745,5,B019A3QMJA,"When Carl Fredricksen was young, his hero was Charles Muntz.  Charles was a world renowned explorer.  It was that love that lead him to Ellie, a girl who also idolized Charles.  The two eventually married.

The years went by, and the two never did fulfill their life long dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America.  Buy the time our story really begins, Carl (voiced now by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man.  The land around his house has been sold to a developer who seizes on one action by Carl to take away his house, too.

The night before Carl has to leave, however, he seizes on an opportunity.  He blows up hundreds of helium balloons and sets out for South America.  He has a stowaway in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer looking to get his badge for helping the elderly.  Together, the two set out on a wild adventure that includes a giant bird and Dug, a talking dog (Bob Peterson).  Will they reach Paradise Falls?

I've got to admit that the last couple of Pixar movies haven't been the homeruns I've come to expect from them.  This movie was perfect in every way, however.

So let's get the negative out of the way first.  This movie is fairly predictable.  I guessed most of the major plot points for the first two thirds of the film not too far into it.  But, as always, the ride through those elements is absolutely wonderful.  And the movie features the return of Pixar's patented climax that will not quit.

The movie expertly balances comedic and tender moments.  This is especially true when Dug shows up.  I can't stop laughing at his antics.  But a musical montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the climax also moved me to tears.  Some have found it too serious, but I think the two are blended perfectly to present us with an uplifting message on the power of people who love us in our lives.

Of course, they bring all this together with the perfect visuals.  Once again, there are some truly breathtaking moments.  I don't know how they keep topping themselves in this department, but they do every time.

The movie is rated PG for mild peril related to a storm early on and elements of the climax.  I think only the easily frightened will have a problem with it.  Additionally, the movie does touch on death and divorce as it relates to our two main characters.  Frankly, I think both are handled well, but parents might want to be prepared to discuss that with their kids.

This truly is an uplifting movie that will make you laugh and send leave you wanting to hug the ones you love.  I may just have a new Pixar favorite.",1257811200,3,2587,4.449893390191898

7569747,5,B019A3QMJA,"A touching, very fun and hilarious animated film that is incredibly beautiful and highly detailed.  Disney*Pixar has once again raised the bar for quality CG animation and awesome storytelling.  ""Up"" is probably the best film thus far to come out in 2009 and a fantastic Blu-ray release from Walt Disney Studios.  There's no doubt about it, this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!

From the creators of ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" comes ""UP"" from Disney*Pixar.  With the yearly success of CG animated films by Disney's Pixar Animation Studio, ""Up"" is not just a film that improves upon modern CG animation, it's a clever film that manages to capture youth but also old age.  Through this film we see pain, loss, laughter, compassion through the wisdom of age but also the naivety and spontaneous side of youth.  An adventure, fantasy film that will capture your attention and make you laugh but also have you in awe of what Pixar Animation Studios was able to accomplish.

""Up"" is directed by Pete Docter (writer for ""Wall-E"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Toy Story"" films),  a screenplay co-written by Bob Peterson (""Ratatouille"", ""Finding Nemo"") and music by Michael Giacchino (""Lost"", ""Fringe"", ""Star Trek"",""Alias"", ""Ratatouille"", ""The Incredibles"").  The film has received mostly all positive reviews from film critics and the film was a box office success making over $292 million worldwide.  The film was the second highest grossing film domestically by Pixar (after ""Finding Nemo"") and the fifth highest grossing animated feature in the US of all time.

And now that film makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut on Nov. 3rd.  ""Up"" on Blu-ray is presented in a four-disc release which includes a Blu-ray Disc, a second Blu-ray Disc with the special features, a DVD copy of the film and a Digital Copy of the film.

The film first introduces us to a young Carl Fredricksen who is watching his idol, the famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer, ""The Insider"", ""Nicholas Nickelby"", ""A Beautiful Mind"") who brings back the skeleton of a 13 ft. bird that he found in South America. Of course, because this bird is a species not known to man, scientist calls the bones as fake and Muntz then decides to leave back to South America and to prove people wrong, he would return with the living bird and won't return until he finds it.

For young Carl, Muntz was his hero and he would wear his pilot goggles and carry a balloon that would say ""Spirit of Adventure"" named after the flying vehicle that Muntz rides.  But Muntz is also the hero of a girl named Ellie.  Both kids love adventure and meet each other in a rundown house which they call their club house.

We then see Carl and Ellie as children and later become young adults who marry and renovate the run down club house to be an actual home.  Ellie's dream and her passion for adventure is to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America and Carl makes his promise to her that he will make it happen.

As they grow older, each time they save money for their trip to Paradise Falls, they run into financial situations in which they have to dip into their savings.  Since Carl makes a living as a balloon vendor, they enjoy a simple life and live in the same house, still in love with each other.  But as time has passed for both Carl and Ellie, by the time they are ready to go on their trip, the two have become very old and eventually, Ellie passes away.

Now older Carl (voice by Edward Asner, ""Lou Grant"", ""Mary Tyler Moore"") is alone, an angry recluse and feels that he has nothing to live for with his wife gone.  His home is all he has and it's his constant memory of his love for Ellie.  But his home is now in an area where commercial buildings are being built and the construction company has tried to buy his home but since it's his memory of Ellie, Carl refuses.  Meanwhile, a Wilderness Explorer, a boy named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) needs his final merit badge and to achieve that, he needs to to ""assist the elderly"".  Russell is a talkative young boy, a bit much for Carl and Carl sends him off to hunt a snipe.

One day, a vehicle of the construction company smashes into his mailbox that he and Ellie painted together and Carl is so much in rage that he beats the construction worker in the head and leads him to bleed.  He goes into court and is ordered to move into the Shady Oaks Retirement Home.

On the day he is to leave his home and start his new life at the retirement home, Carl unleashes his plan by using all his balloons which takes his home out of the ground and flies off and literally avoiding from him to separate himself from the home that he and Ellie had lived in for decades.  His goal is to make good with that promise he made to Ellie and that is to move their home to Paradise Falls in South America.

All seems good for Carl, until he receives a knock on the door and realizes that young Russell was snipe hunting on the porch all this time.  Thus Carl is shocked that his plans may be thwarted because he has a child with him.

Carl and Russell end up in South America where they  meet a very tall bird which Russell names it ""Kevin"" and also meet up with a dog named Dug who is able to talk (due to a neck collar that allows speech) who seems to be hunting for the bird for his master.  The four end up being on an adventure through tough terrain in South America.  Why is Dug after Kevin?  Why is Kevin needing the help of Carl and Russell?  And who is the original master of Dug who built the talking collar?  But most of all, will Carl be able to keep his promise to Ellie by bringing the house to Paradise Falls?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Up"" is an audio and visual treat.  Presented in 1080p (1:78:1), Disney*Pixar raised the bar of their own previous works and managed to capture so much detail in this film, literally I was floored by how incredible this film looks.  From the moment I saw the CG skin of Carl, the detail of the clothing, of leather, the detail inside the home of Carl and Ellie, the detail on the plants, the rocks, the sky, you name it...""Up"" is an incredible looking film on High Definition but an animated film in which the famous animation studio has raised the bar yet again.

By watching how the creative arts group at Pixar actually went up high into the Tepui mountains, saw all the rock formations for themselves, a chance to embrace, draw and see how things are in the area but also see how Paradise Falls looks in reality, definitely gave the crew a major incentive to make sure the atmosphere of ""Up"" was just as detailed as they saw with their own eyes.  From the flowers, the plants, the unusual rock formations, the sky and weather conditions, the animation crew was able to capture it so closely with again, so much detail... I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looks.

There are also details in the way Russell wears his clothes and the clothing movement, the hair of the dogs and how the lighting effects reflect from the hair off the dogs, the slobber of the dogs.  Just the way the physics are with the balloons as it carries the house and more!  There is just a lot of well-thought out details that come along with the film and you just can't help but be impressed.

Picture quality is absolutely fantastic!  Walt Disney Studios have pretty much been leaders in quality for their animated releases on Blu-ray and the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and dark but again, the sheer amount of detail is just incredible.  No compression, no banding.  If there was a film that I can easily classify as ""reference quality"", ""Up"" is definitely a film I would put high up there.

As for audio quality, the film is presented in English 5.1 and 2.0 DTS-HD (and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby).  The film also sounds incredible.  From the dogs barking all around you, the sound of the weather around South America, the balloons popping and the action sequences at the end of the film.  Sound is crystal clear from the front and center channels.  The film also sports solid surrounds capturing the overall ambiance and rear surrounds and also good amount of LFE usage especially during the storm sequences and when the house is bumping around the rocks.

This is definitely a film that sounds incredible on Blu-ray and the lossless audio is definitely crystal clear and immersive.  Overall, this is a soundtrack that has its immersive moments but what captures your attention and what sets the mood is the beautiful soundtrack by composer Michael Giacchino.  The beautiful music that captures that feel of yesteryear is just amazing.

As for subtitles, subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

The DVD features video in widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 Televisions.  Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 Surround Sound.  Subtitles are in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I absolutely love ""Up"" and I think that aside from the great detail and animation, what I enjoyed is how it communicates to adults as Carl and Ellie are absolutely relatable to the adults and married couples and you can understand the pain that he goes through when you lose that special someone in your life.  The film does a great job of balancing his story, his emotions of trying to keep Ellie's memory alive through his home, while Russell represents that innocent and naive child and seeing these two characters, total opposites together and trying to make things work.

But what I found touching is that initial first 10-15 minutes of the film and seeing Carl and Ellie grow and the pain they have encountered in their life.  The inability to have a child, to see their dreams dashed by situations that required the money they saved up for their trip but the pain of seeing how these two have grown from children to seniors.  One thing that the Pixar crew wanted to accomplish with this film is to capture that appreciation you have for your grandparents but also, an animated film that young children can enjoy through the character of Russell.

There are some deep things that happen in the film, circumstances that children probably will not understand but for adults, these emotions that touch you profoundly.  Of course, a lot of these deep emotions are for the first 15 minutes of the film between Carl and Ellie as we see flashbacks through their married years but the film becomes highly entertaining once we see the child, Russell and the old man Carl together and having to work together, despite Carl getting a bit annoyed by Russell's youth and non-stop talking and moving.

But it's the pacing set by the screenwriters that work.  The film never gets boring as it the film becomes very adventurous and also humorous throughout.  The humor of a house traveling throughout parts of the world on hundreds of balloons is just a fun concept.  And again, the film never gets boring.  It's just an exciting and fun ride when both Carl and Russell are together and manages to end with an uplifting ending.

And the fun doesn't stop there.  This Blu-ray release is packed.  Four discs with special features that really go into how this film was created and learning about the things that inspired the filmmakers but also the trip the Pixar crew took to the mountains that inspired them to create that atmosphere.  That was great to see.  But also there are fun shorts for the children as well and also a game.  And of course, a DVD for those long commutes and a digital copy as well.

As for the PG rating, this is the second Pixar animated film to get the rating since ""The Incredibles"" and mainly its because of the action sequences.  Those sequences are not scary at all and I watched the film with my six-year-old.  If anything, he was asking questions which related to Carl and Ellie's marriage (parts which relate to a scene in which Carl and Ellie are unable to have children and the scene where Carl is mourning after Ellie's passing).

""Up"" is a film that was geared not just for children but for adults.  The film is mature enough for adults to appreciate, enjoy and to be ultimately touched but also lively, fun and exciting for children to enjoy.  Definitely one of the top films of 2009 and one of the top Blu-ray releases of the year thus far.  Overall, ""Up"" is absolutely magnificent and this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!",1257811200,15,16228,4.627841902763204

That being said, I did see this in the theater, but I did not get to see it in 3D. We desperately wanted to see the 3D version, but by the time the family was able to get together, all theaters had stopped the 3D showings.

7569750,3,B019A3QMJA,"I'm very disappointed as I just received mine and it's broken. I don't want to return it, as Amazon doesn't know when they'll be able to provide a replacement (and given the legal issues with Luxo, I'm not sure they ever will). I can probably fix it, but pretty annoying to deal with this on something that cost $120.

A little more detail on the item. It's not a standalone lamp (and this is probably why mine broke). It is actually a flat plastic base, with the lamp permanently attached. Since the base of the lamp can't move, it put a lot more strain on the point where the bottom 'neck' of the lamp meets the round base, and the plastic 'dowel' (for lack of a better term) broke. The break isn't somewhere visible, and crazy glue will probably take care of it, but grrrrr...

Anyway, the base the lamp is attached to is roughly the size/shape of the base of the box pictured. There's an indentation with an adjustable 'thumb' which holds your disc cases (spines out, like books - not as pictured in the box).

Overall, the quality is what I expected for the price. The lamp base and shroud are metal. Most of the armature is plastic. The lamp works, and is powered by batteries in the base (not AC). If it hadn't broken, I'd feel it was slightly overpriced, but I'd still be happy with it.",1257811200,2,1294,4.383333333333334

That's right, a kid's movie enjoyable by an adult but with no inapropriate humor to make it happen. Everyone likes PIXAR movies. Even angsty emo teenagers who grumble through the whole thing are secretly touched by their honest storytelling.

I've had the same boyfriend for 5 years neow and I have never ONCE seen him cry in a movie. I, on the other hand, cry at the drop of the hat. Of course I'm crying through the for 5 minutes of the movie, but I look over at my boyfriend and see *GASP* he too is crying! But don't worry parents! This movie is not overly sad. PIXAR knows what is neccisary in a story and how to tell it tastefully. The first 5 - 10 minutes is rather sad, but it is a natural part of life.

Of course the rest of the movie is pure genius. I'm always surrounded by dogs and they nailed the personality of the dogs perfectly. From their frequent distractions to their frightening intensity when on the hunt. Kevin is also delightful and the boy is easy to relate to.

The only thing that really shocked me in this movie was the demise of the villan. ***SPOILER*** I am terrified by heights and when I watched him slide of the side of the balloon and fall to the earth I felt my stomach go somewhere far away ***SPOILER*** While this is rather shocking it's really the only way for this story to end.

People with younger kids may find themselves explaining death to their toddler, but this is a talk we all need to have with out kids at some point. Other than that, UP! was delightful!

It's theme of love, acceptance, personal growth, and all the things that are really important along with its wonderful, wonderful characters will stay with you forever.  I know nothing about animation.  Visually, it seemed stunning.  But while so many animated films rely on the visual alone, this is as complex and vibrant a story I've seen in a film in quite some time.  Oh, and it's hilarious.

7569760,5,B019A3QMJA,"I had no expectations of being disappointed with a Disney/Pixar BD, and being that it took me a whole dedicated day to get through everything, I now feel it was worth every penny. The film was enjoyable, funny, sad, and scary filled with some nice messages about life and loss. I can understand why the majority of my customers loved it.

The Blu clarity is outstanding, and the amount of reference points are extensive, but one that stands out the most for contrast lines would have to be when the house is entering the lair (balloons against the dark cavern). The sound is selectable between 5.1 DTS, 2.0 DTS and Descriptive English. The 5.1 was beautiful with tons of reference points, sometimes excruciating (that bird screeching) but thorough nonetheless. Now for the supplements (all times in minutes):

DISC 1: (BD)
* 5:46 Partly Cloudy short film. Was hilarious. A great depth test for your display with the clouds. Nice little message of tolerance no matter how difficult someone might be.
* 4:40 Dug's Mission. An almost lo-def looking short take on our main dog dealing with the main three baddies on a chase.
* 22:17 Adventure Out There. A must see documentary about the crew taking the actual trip to the Tepui location in South America. A beautiful travel infomercial in itself. Loved how their guide only wore sandles for the ascent and hikes.
* 4:56 Alternate Scenes Ending of Muntz. Sketches and interviews regarding different endings for that bad guy that they had come up with.
* 1:00 How-to on using the Digital Copy.
* Cine Explore option while watching the film. The two directors give their commentary with multiple pop-up screens showing art, ideas, etc.
* Screen Saver. Allows you to set a time period for your screen saver to activate.
* Maximize Your Home Theater. The standard Pixar multi-step process for setting all of your theater capabilities.

DISC 2: (BD)
Documentaries
* 6:24 Geriatric Hero. History behind the creation of our old guy. All of these documentaries are interview oriented with sketches and film clips to supplement.
* 8:26 Canine Companions. In depth analysis on the breed choices, training and dog behavior studied to get the dogs in the film to be more - dog like.
* 9:00 Russel Wild Explorer. Covers the reasons for his character to have the loss and why he was ""egg"" shaped as opposed to other sketch ideas.
* 5:04 Kevin (bird). Nice reference to the Swiss Family Robinson ostrich; covered the hardest part of any of these animation films - the feathers.
* 4:38 Homemakers Pixar. Enjoyed the work that went into them studying sub-floors and lighting options in making this look so real in the house.
* 6:25 Balloons and Flight. Tells the now famous number of balloons used; some interesting dirigible history; shows the Pixar group using that local Bay Area air service I keep seeing fly around here (research stuff).
* 7:37 Composing for Characters. Have to be into the musical/scoring stuff for this one.

Extras
* Global Guardian Badge Game. After the initial setup of name, difficulty levels and tutorial material, the game has an extensive amount of country/geography material. Customers grouped around and we did fine for the United States section, but we randomly tried Africa and we bombed (some of the countries they were asking for I hadn't heard of in years) - good learning tool though.
* 9:15 Alternate Scene - Married Life. Another sketch/interview piece about more material being removed/added into that section of the film. The scene itself would have been only a minute longer.
* 6:00 montage. A mix of characters doing funny things - will make the kids laugh.
* Screen Saver option.

DISC 3 (DVD)
* Film, plus special features from disc 1. WITH THE EXCEPTION of no Spanish subtitles/language; English only.

DISC 4 (Digital Copy).
* Code both unlocks the copy and gets you the usual points at the Disney site.

Overall, an excellent product no matter how you look at it. The case has that new single hinge, multi-page off center chassis that has proven to be less than durable, but it should suffice for low usage storage. Enjoy.",1257379200,387,4100,4.831908831908832
7569761,5,B019A3QMJA,"I've seen this movie three times now, at intervals from the release last summer through last Tues night, and ""UP"" gets better every time I see it.  There are both overt and subtle funny bits galore!

Pixar lives up to its amazingly high standards of quality of animation AND storytelling in this far-fetched, yet overwhelmingly fun film.

If you are like me you don't often laugh out loud while you watch movies, but I did frequently during this show.  The devotion of the now cranky old man to his wife's memory and a promise he made her drives the storyline, while the ""small mailman"" (boy scoutish) child provides a solid helping of comic relief.

You will come to love lines like: ""SQUIRREL!"", ""I just met you and I love you!"", ""Oh, it's before!"", and many more.

If you are a fan of other Pixar films you will certainly enjoy this one too.  I'd say that it's as good as any of the other Pixar movies that have been released.  I think that the thing that makes them great is that the folks at Pixar are able to take the humor in everyday life and place it in incredibly unlikely situations.  Pixars stories also grasp our imaginations today the same way that movie serials and Buck Rogers did for members of previous generations.

The problem is that as of late, with some exceptions including Bridge To Terabithia, the disney films have seemed to be lacking alot in what made them special to begin with. Up was able to bring back those heartfelt moments that had been gone for a fair amount time and for me, it was a complete throwback to movies like the little mermaid,tarzan and even the most depressing disney film, the fox and the hound, all of which had scenes of sadness,joy,family,loss...that are important for everyone to see and that bring the magic to us. I loved UP, I recommend it to everyone who's a disney fan or even if you're not, go out and buy it,rent, check it out at the library if you to because it's worth and it has quite a bunch of themes in it that you can talk about with your family once it's over.",1256515200,7,906,4.273255813953488
7569767,4,B019A3QMJA,"""Up"" is a great movie. I mean really as a ""movie"". It is not and should not be regarded as another one for the children. In my opinion, just like ""Watchmen"" is not a comic (similar to Wall-e), ""Up"" is a genre's step towards maturation.

Pixar has been doing this ever since they came up with Toy Story (probably still my favorite of them all). They knew that half of their audience were the parents that had to sit for 90 minutes in the movie theater with their kids and while trying to not get them bored they started adding bits of adult references to their films. And now, the final step has been taken. In my opinion, ""Up"" is more of an adult movie then a children's animation film.

And it is good. I liked it but my 4-year old had less connection to it than me. Probably she will love it when she is 7 or 8. They do grow up very fast nowadays. And what they watch on TV and movies do have an effect.

As almost everyone else said, it makes you laugh and it makes you cry. It is full of emotions. Try it, you will like it.",1256515200,3,1027,4.0492610837438425

My wife and I both told each other after we watched it that we couldn't wait until this one came out on DVD so our son could watch it as he is still too young to go the theater. This will tide me over until Toy Story 3 comes out next year, which I am sure will be another great addition to the Toy Story saga.

7569772,5,B019A3QMJA,"With their 10th theatrical release 'Up' Pixar continues to prove that they are the best film production studio out there today. Continually improving their animating abilities (no matter what Pixar movie it is I am awestruck at the quality) and writing ORIGINAL (sans the very average Cars) stories, the geniuses out west could take the easy route but that is not the Pixar way.

If you have seen the trailers you are no doubt focused on the balloons that carry the lead role away in his house but the main focus is that this is a LOVE STORY. The first 10 minutes are some of Pixar's best work ever which is very analogous to the first 30 minutes of WALL-E which is brought down by a very average 2nd and 3rd act (WALL-E). We learn of Carl Fredricksen falling in love with Elle, are quickly shown highlights of their happy life together and their continual goal to go on a great adventure in South America. A great adventure that they never were able to take together due to lack of money and Elle's death (this is a deeper movie than other Pixar productions so be prepared to talk to your kids).

After Elle is gone, Carl decides that he must take action to go on that adventure they never got to do. Along the way he meets up with a young boy, talking dog(s), crazy bird and an antagonist that Karl must defeat.

The animation in Up is of course top notch. The story is creative and original, and it's a joy to watch. The only thing that hurts this movie is it's not very kid-friendly in my opinion. I took my 4 1/2 year old daughter and 30 minutes in she wanted to leave (we stayed for the whole thing). I feel the main audience for this movie is adults and senior citizens (yes I am serious) with children and teenagers second this time around. Kids will probably like it but not like Toy Story, Monsters or Nemo.

For fun I will rank the Pixar movies according to me but this is completely subjective. If you search the web about the only constant you will find is that Cars is the weakest movie, as for the rest, everyone has their favorites.

People final saw past the pixels and saw the story and the characters instead.

Well if that is the gold standard, then Pixar has not only struck gold with Up but it has found diamonds on the side.

The story is a moving combination of humour and sadness, a tale of courage and dedication. Told with elegance and intelligence and filled with some hilarious story-lines and effects. The characterization is superb. Ed Asner captures the spirit of crotchety and lovable Carl Fredricksen, while Jordan Nagai keeps pace and acts as a charming and determined Russell. I won't say too much more about the other characters but hats off to them too.

I was taken in in the first five minutes and amazed by Pete Docter and Bob Petersen's sensitive and smart story telling. Their ability is most telling in those scenes where there is no dialogue at all and they put their trust in the cinematography - and this faith is rewarded. I think these are some of the movie's best scenes.

Thanks Pixar for sharing! I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I laughed again and again, and I left the movie, well, UPlifted.

7569778,5,B019A3QMJA,"I do enjoy Blu-ray. I also enjoy DVD. I NEVER use a digital copy, as I don't have an I-anything and the idea of watching a high def on a screen smaller than 32 inches makes no sense to me. When I first saw this, I thought the description of his package being a four disc edition was a typo.

I LOVE the idea of packaging a Blu-ray and a regular DVD together in the same package, since I don't have Blu-ray in every room of my house and would like to watch a movie in a room other than the one my home entertainment system is in and I've been forced to buy two copies of the same movie to do so. HD DVD had the right idea by putting one of each on the two sides of the disc, but I'll take a separate DVD copy instead.

What I'm annoyed about is the practice of putting the extras on a separate disc, since one of the ideas behind Blu-ray was to put out a disc that could hold roughly three times the information a DVD could, so I find putting extras on a separate disc is nothing more than an excuse to jack the price up, as is the digital copy.

Since this is the way it is (and it's not confined to Disney, by the way), I will have to buy the four disc set because the three disc set is only offering the movie, extras, and the useless digital copy. I don't like it, but I love this movie and I love Pixar, so I'm willing to pay for it. I don't like it, but since I don't have a choice, there you go.",1253491200,2,1401,3.857638888888889
7569779,5,B019A3QMJA,"This is a review about the type of package you get with the Bluray. First to those who are complaining about the price... if you think that this pack is really going to sell for more than $30 on release day, you are a poor shopper. Target, Walmart and others will have a special first week discount just like they did with the Bolt Bluray/Dvd combo pack and Amazon will most likely discount it to be competitive as well. Second I think the appearance of Blurays bundled with Dvds is the best thing ever! Here is why: I am a childless adult and I love animated movies like Wall-e, Bolt, Ice Age but let's face it--they are KIDS MOVIES. MOST KIDS DO NOT HAVE A BLURAY PLAYER IN THEIR ROOM. As such, the largest audience for these movies is not going to find much use in a Bluray unless the whole family watches it in their home's entertainment center. Most parents will not buy a Bluray and instead buy a Dvd due to price and its usability as I just described. Junior is not going to drag the Bluray into his room only to find out it does not play on his Dvd player and then leave the disc it on the floor among his toys like all the other  Dvds he has collected; at least that's what parents don't want so they don't buy the Bluray. So this package is ingenious because it solves this problem and you get every possible format. I bet many would not have otherwise bought the Bluray if it did not have this Dvd addition. I wish all Blurays were packaged like this because I am always willing to pay $5-10 more than that special multi-disc Dvd edition to get this!

7569780,5,B019A3QMJA,"`Up' is another Pixar gem.  Able to transport the minds of young and old and enhance its story with sympathy and charm, the movie is understandably touted as one of the year's best.

Since the beginning of their marriage, Carl Frederickson (Edward Asner) and his wife Ellie (Elie Docter) have yearned to move to Paradise Falls in South America.  Smitten by his childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl and Ellie scrimp and save, but contingencies force them to open their savings jar until one day Ellie passes away, and Carl is forced to live alone with his dream broken and nothing but his memories intact.

Around his house construction workers are building new city buildings, and a job foreman coaxes Carl to sell his house.  One day Carl confronts a worker who damages his mailbox, and the ordeal sets Carl up to be placed in a nursing home.  Carl then meets a young boy scout who wishes to earn his final merit badge, assisting an elderly person.  The boy gets more than he bargained for as Carl desperately tries to regain his footing and elude those who would change his life forever.

Colorful and cute, Carl's journey and the characters he encounters are enough to enthrall, but the story is even more transporting.  The peril is enough to keep even teenagers interested, yet keep their sympathies for the elderly intact.  The way the animated scenes unfold is the most engrossing aspect of yet another successful Pixar project.",1252800000,4,1465,4.847389558232932

Love makes us do astonishing, amazing things.

Things that surprise even us.

Things that push us past what we thought were our limits.

Things that are utterly, literally fantastic, i.e., things that exist only in the realm of fantasy.

Love ties us together; it makes us understand ourselves and how much we need each other.

With themes like that, Up qualifies as the most, er, uplifting story in many a year.

It's the story of an old man, his absent late wife, a young boy, a dog and a bird -- and what they're willing to do for love. It's hysterically funny, heartbreaking and heartwarming.

It's made by the folks at Pixar, which has put out so many great stories that it must be considered the contemporary corporate home of master storytellers. Another home run into the next county.

And I always try to remember the short at the beginning of the evening; the Pixar folks remember how much fun it was to have a cartoon with Road Runner, Bugs Bunny or even Pepe LePew before the main feature. ""Partly Cloudy"" is a sweetly creative turn on the old myth that storks deliver babies -- it probably started with the question, OK, if storks deliver babies, where do they get the babies from? As always, the short warms up the audience with a healthy dose of bellylaughs and sentiment, softening us up for the story of Carl, Ellie, Russell, Dug and Kevin.

7569782,1,B019A3QMJA,"This is a product review. There are many positive reviews of the movie itself, and I agree it's a wonderful movie..up to Pixar's standards.
BUT:
Disney seems to think that they can take advantage of the consumers merely because this is a Pixar film. Notice:

The SINGLE disc set contains:
The movie
Dug's Special Mission
Partly Cloudy

The TWO-disc Edition contains:

DISC ONE:
The movie
Dug's Special Mission
Partly Cloudy
Commentary
The Many Endings of Muntz
Documentary

Disc Two:
Digital copy ONLY...no other special features on disc two...

If the second disc of this ""TWO-disc Special edition"" only contains the digital copy, then technically speaking, the first disc could (and/or should) be EXACTLY the same for both the single and two-disc versions.

Some people would rather have ALL of the bonus features and NO digital copy. What's more: the digital copy requires a special code to access it, and the code expires...so it's not really a ""two-disc"" deluxe version for very long.

For those who complain about the Blu-ray version, I feel your pain as well. Even so, I would appreciate it if Disney put all of those ""Blu-ray exlcusive"" features on regular DVD as well..maybe if those were included as part of the ""Two-disc"" version, then it wouldn't look as bad.

Even the makers of the Luxo Lamp have noticed Disney's ridiculous attempt at corporate greed for this film. They are suing Disney for offering a replica Luxo Jr. Lamp with a limited number of copies of the blu-ray version of UP. Disney didn't have the right to the lamp, and message boards are claiming that the replica is largely plastic (versus the actual metal Luxo lamp). Disney is trying to sell an inferior product, and they deserve the lawsuit.

As much as I want to buy this film, I am simply disgusted with Disney and Buena Vista Home Entertainment for their ridiculous DVD treatment of this film.

7569783,5,B019A3QMJA,"In my opinion Pixar is the gold standard for film quality. They have always excelled at bringing films that can and do appeal to all ages. Rarely is there a false note, Pixar leaves cloying to Disney. While I have enjoyed all the Pixar films, and have my favorites, no Pixar film is ""bad"". Both Wall*E and UP achieve an emotional resonance that is rare in live action films, let alone in a ""cartoon"". The only movie I have on my iPod is Wall*E-it's the only film I've bought with a digital download that I actually wanted to download. It would have been nice if Disney could have included a digital download with the regular DVD release. I don't own a Blue Ray player, so I can't comment on the kerfuffle going on with the 3 disc Blue Ray. I won't ding the film for what Disney does or doesn't do. I also don't feel the film, which was shown in 3-D in theatres will suffer from not being a 3-D disc. I saw ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" on disc at a friends house, on a big screen TV. I had a blistering headache at the end as I couldn't see the film in good registration. (I wear prescription glasses, so cheesy cardboard glasses present several difficulties for me.) 3-D is immaterial to UP. It was nice to see it in 3-D at the show, but it has no impact on the plot or action of the film on disc. There is no paddle ball moment in UP as there is in ""House of Wax"". This is a terrific film, and if you're a human being who isn't embarrassed to be moved by a movie, especially an animated one, then you should be able to enjoy UP. Everyone involved did a terrific job. This is an excellent film.",1252627200,3,1602,4.154340836012862

7569787,5,B019A3QMJA,"Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie. But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful animated movies like ""Up,"" which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little story about loss and love.

As a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their ""clubhouse"" together, and lived a long, sadly childless life together. When Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.

Now crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't going quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away toward South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge.

And the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug (""I am jumping on you, bird!""), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.

Industry experts were babbling about how ""Up"" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.

In fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.

But it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue (""Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything."" ""Cool! My mom loves that game!"") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.

Ed Asner is absolutely perfect as ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing he's clinging to the past. Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, chattery Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk (""I hid under your porch because I love you"") and act the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.

The two-disc edition is going to have some very nice extras, but once again people with regular-def DVDs are going to get shafted because the Blu-ray edition will have a bunch of exclusive stuff. Grr. As for this one, there's a digital copy, the director's audio commentary, kinda-alternate-ending ""The Many Endings of Muntz,"" and the documentary ""Adventure Is Out There"" about the research for this movie.

There are also a pair of adorable animated shorts. ""Partly Cloudy"" has a much-abused stork having to deliver potentially harmful baby creatures from a kind but clueless cloud. And ""Dug's Special Mission"" is a sort of backstory for the adorable Dug, explaining what the heck he was doing before he met up with Carl and Russell.

""Up"" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy. With that, I have only one more thing to say... SQUIRREL!",1250812800,288,4198,4.941843971631205
7569788,5,B019A3QMJA,"Irony: when Disney/Pixar produces one of their most complex and entertaining pictures to date and gives it the simplest possible title.

Up is the lovely, touching story of Carl (Ed Asner)'s love for Ellie, and how loss can harden a person until the right friend comes along and breaks down those walls.  Carl and Ellie meet as kids, and they instantly bond over their shared love for famed explorer Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They plan to someday travel to Paradise Falls in South Africa together, and, as time progresses, they end up falling in love.

Carl and Ellie's dream takes a back seat, however, to the adult responsibilities that come with growing up, such as getting jobs and running a house. The couple tries to have children, but Ellie ultimately loses the baby - a scene that will have you weeping into your pillow within the first 10 minutes of the film. (The name ""Disney"" is usually synonymous with ""tear-jerker,"" but they outdo themselves here.)

Seemingly unable to ever successfully have children together, Carl and Ellie are content to enjoy each other's company, always keeping their dream of visiting Paradise Falls in the rear-view. Though, of course, when they have finally saved up enough money to travel, Ellie succumbs to old age and passes away, leaving Carl to grow more bitter every day that he spends alone.  (Quite the dark backdrop to all of those colorful balloons, eh?)

Despite being informed of construction plans that will affect his house, Carl refuses to move away, not wanting to leave the memento of his and Ellie's relationship behind. Just when you thought things couldn't get any sadder, an unfortunate accident involving Carl's mailbox lands Carl in court, where the court orders him to relocate to a retirement home. Carl, of course, will have none of that, and he spends that night attaching the now famous thousands of balloons to his house.  (Did you know that they animated each individual balloon string? Lord have mercy.)

In the morning, Carl takes off, allowing the balloons to lift him and his house to Paradise Falls where he will live out the remainder of his golden years, free from human interaction. Unfortunately for Carl, his plan is abruptly cut short when Russell, a ""Wilderness Explorer"" who is just trying to earn his last badge (""Assisting the Elderly""), is trapped with Carl on the now-flying porch.  Can't really tell the kid to ""get off your lawn"" at that point, right?

Along the way, Carl and Russell meet Kevin, a poorly named exotic bird, and Dug, the dog with the voice-translating collar who can ""speak"" his thoughts with the turn of a dial. Dug is the comic relief in the film, and you will be quoting ""Squirrel!"" for weeks after watching. Carl and Russell, of course, encounter  setbacks along the way (what happens when the balloons begin to pop?), though they do eventually meet up with Muntz in a ""you should never meet your heroes"" kind of situation.

The vibrancy of the colors and the details that went into the animation here are positively breathtaking. The emotion of this film is stronger than in any other Pixar film that came before it. Carl's loss is palpable, and there's a moment near the end of the film that will fill you with as many happy tears as the sad ones you cried at the beginning.  Seriously.  This film is like the animated version of The Notebook.  Have tissues handy.",1250812800,,3390,4.810671256454389
7569789,5,B019A3QMJA,"Up is a great film and defiantly ranks as one of Pixar's best- as well as one of the best animated films of the last ten years.  The only films that can compare are Pixar's Wall-E and The Incredibles.  The film is just a pure delight and one of the most mature films to come from the company that is without a doubt the most consistently entertaining studio in all of Hollywood.  It was easily the most mature, well thought out film I viewed during the 2009 Summer Movie Season, and I'm sure it will be considered one of the best films of the year.

Story:  The story is one that has the light-hearted fantasy feel of a children's movie, while at the same time retaining the dark elements of an adult tale of obsession and greed.  Its plot is a very complex analysis about the passion of love, loss, and obsession and I was fascinated every-single second.  But, I should warn parents, behind the cute old man and the flying house this is ranks up with The Incredibles as one of the darkest films to receive the PG rating within the states.

The story is about an old man who, after the death of his wife, lives a lonely, uneventful wife.  After assaulting a construction worker he is deemed a threat to the community and is told that he shall be removed from his home and forced into a retirement community.  With little choice he chooses to fulfill the dream that him and his spouse shared of placing their home near Paradise Falls in South America.

Using thousands of helium filled balloons he begins this expedition, but along the way he is joined by many unexpected companions, ranging from a determined scout, a talking dog, and a large exotic bird.  In the end he is forced to decide what matters most in life.

The film is modeled after the serials of the 1930s-1950s and carries along that fun, adventurous spirit throughout.

Animation:  It's Pixar, what do you expect?  As usual it is top of the line and obviously had long hours of emotional effort put into it.  The animators for Pixar never seem fed-up with their jobs and always deliver the best.

Voices:  Voice-acting is also top of the line.  Every voice actor is clearly treating the role seriously and having a fun time doing it.

I highly recommend Up to children and adults- heck, I would recommend the movie to an adult, regardless of whether or not they had children.  It's just that good of a movie that it transcends age groups to be the most widely appealing film of the summer.
