8268642,5,B001870EFU,"We purchased this video for our daughter to begin learning signs to aid her in communicating.  It is extremely well done, with adorable animated characters - the Diaper Doodles kids - that teach children the signs for favorite items they use everyday.  Our daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and loves watching the video and has learned to use all of the signs!  I would recommend this video for anyone that would like their child to learn to sign, whether as an extra language or to aid those children that may have some challenges communicating.  It is both educational and entertaining!",1361491200,2,580,4.712871287128713
