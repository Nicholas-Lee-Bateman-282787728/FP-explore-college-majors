Two actors, one room and it's magic--not the magic of childhood  dreams come true but the dark magic of tragic possibilities when things are out of control.

432238,5,6302135397,"This movie is fantastic on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. Alan Rickman plays an interrogator who inflicts mind games and torture on a children's book writer (Madeleine Stowe). These two actors are the only people in the movie, and it is set in just one room. Rickman should have gotten an Oscar for his acting in this film. The scene where he plays three different people with his voice is outstanding. Stowe is also incredible in this movie, and her intensity matches Rickman's in every way.

Kudos to the film for illuminating the common, underlying dynamic between the two. It's incredibly intense and graphic - I had to stop the tape at one point and just breathe.  But it's the closest thing I've seen on film to my own experience as an incest survivor.  For more along this line, watch the excellent ""Death and The Maiden"" with Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley and Stuart Wilson.

432262,5,6302135397,"I originally saw this video for Alan Rickman's performance and as usual he doesn't disappoint. But be prepared for a very unpleasant movie.

This is the story of a children's author that is brought in for ""questioning"" by a nameless government. The whole film takes place in one room where she is questioned (tortured) by a government official (Rickman). The story quickly becomes psychological warfare between the two characters as the ""victim"" is not as easily broken as the government inquisitor first thought. By the end of the movie the balance of power has shifted and it's the inquisitor who may break under his own sadism.

The violence in the movie is not horror movie graphic but it is far more brutal in its realistic potrayal. The actual acts are cut-aways that you don't see(mostly) but the suggestion of the acts make you squirm.

I did find the strange sub-plot of their relationship revealed at the end to be out of place. I didn't think it necessary to the stark experimental plot. But that's just my opinion. The ending is left up to the viewer.

Did he free her or kill her?

are you the type who must watch a film to KEEP from thinking? Are you always looking for pure entertainment?

If you answered yes to any of that- be careful of watching this film. It is perhaps the single most dramatic piece either actour will ever attempt on film. It is enough to scare the daylights out of the sane and confirm the cruelty of the world to the unbalanced.

I will not tell you the story line. I will tell you that it will leave you sitting in silence, contemplating the entirity of the film. and never again will you look upon human rights violations with the same disconnection.

432265,5,6302135397,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  However, in order to get anything out of it, you have to have an open mind.  Here, I am not referring to the ability to understand someone else's ideas, but rather you need to be able to allow the visual and autitory aspects to truly penetrate into your head.  If you are interested in the kind of action that is considered ""entertaining"", you will likely be disappointed.  As many have already said, there is very little actual violence presented on screen.  What has not been said is that there is subtle cruelty and manipulation present non-stop.  Donald Maass in ""Writing the Break-out Novel"" says that a novel should have ""tension on every page"" (174).  This movie has tension in every gesture.

Another thing people say is that the success of this movie is due entirely to the acting.  While I agree that the acting is probably the best acting I've ever seen, if you have good acting and a terrible script, you will end up with a bad movie.  Or at least a comic one that pokes fun at itself (and thus loses reality).  This movie is frighteningly real, and part of the credit for that goes to the writer.

Another thing I haven't seen people say is the way ordinary objects are juxtaposed into this unreal and horrifying setting.  Tomatoes, cigarrettes, garlic, ice, water (and some not-water).  Along with that, the animation or trance sequences that are even more unreal than the actual setting add to this as well.

I have two very minor criticisms:

1.  The ending felt rushed and lacking in intensity.  It was a definite disappointment after the very intense beginning and middle sections.

2.  I did not like the way in which the child abuse subplot got connected to the main plot.  Even if the interrogator was only pretending to have been her abuser, this should have been made clearer to avoid it coming off as a fluke (i.e. this particular man was deranged as opposed to the whole system of arrest/interrogation being wrong regardless of who the interrogator was).  I felt that that also reduced the overall intensity and power of the movie... it also sends the message that only evil people are capable of evil actions, when the truth is that these scenarios turn decent people into monsters (as discovered in the Zimbardo prison experiment).

In another movie, these two things would have caused me to give it a lower rating, but the other aspects make up so much for those that it that I cannot praise this movie enough.  The child abuse sub-plot can be seen as a metaphor, and in that artistic sense, it brings an entirely new level to the movie and its horrors, and at the very least, the ending is ambiguous, rather than easily tied up.  Not knowing exactly what comes next for them only amplifies the terror.  So, despite not being perfect, both items I criticise do add something.",1163376000,7,2862,4.628968253968254
432266,4,6302135397,"this incredibly intense movie is the thing of nightmares, both for the viewer and the character played by madeline stowe.

the only different slant i have to add from what other viewers have said is besides wanting to hate and fear Alan Rickman's character-i also think one has to also feel sorry for him.

 what made him a child molester in the first place? was he really a college professor at one time? did the government ""recruit"" him as a torturer/interogator against his will? is he really being watched as he performs his ""job"" and what are the consequences to him if he disobeys? has he himself bee through some type of tortue and been ""broken""? what is the meaning of the scene of him driving in the rain during a particularly intense part of the film-does he also have a ""closet land"" that he escapes to while performing inhuman acts of tortue? does he really regret all he is doing/has done or does it give him pleasure

only mr. rickman can inspire such conflicting feelings in us.",1137542400,8,993,4.561797752808989
432267,2,6302135397,"Is this supposed to be about childhood abuse? Or about political torture? The sponsorship of Amnesty International suggests the latter. But the whole issue of childhood sexual abuse--upon which the movie seems to turn, since it is hinted at early on and seems to be at the core of what the prisoner is refusing to tell--is weirdly at odds with the supposed political message. It's as if, on the one hand, the story is just using this mysterious torture as a means of getting her to confess that she was abused as a child. On the other hand, the abuse seems like a something that's been introduced at random--but with mysterious importance--into this story about political torture. It's as if the movie doesn't know what it wants to be about. Or as if it's trying to equate childhood abuse with political torture--and that may be the case, given some of the things the prisoner says in her final speech--which is a connection that just didn't click for me. The only reason I am rating this film as high as I am is due to Alan Rickman's amazing performance as the interrogator. But I honestly can't recommend this film just on the basis of that performance. It seems more like a catalog of torture methods than a story. Propaganda seldom makes good art, and although this film seems to try really hard to avoid being propaganda against any one real-life government, it still fails to be good art. Disappointing.",1119312000,,1409,4.685483870967742

If it Stank, we could always watch something mindless that explodes alot.  We turned out the light and started the movie... Not a single peep from any of them until the end of the film.  Suddenly, intellectual discussion spontaneously erupted from these otherwise shallow people...I was astounded.  They found the movie enlightening and interesting and disturbing at the same time.  Note: there are only two people in the entire film?  This should have been on stage.  Rickman was amazing and Stowe was a bright shining star.

It shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round"" theater. Which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action. This movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and I'd say they have made a success of that goal.",1092528000,6,674,4.2734375

I agree with the reviewer who said to watch it alone in a quiet room......you will be drawn in and profoundly moved by not only the story, but the superb acting.  Madeleine Stowe is very good and Alan Rickman is just incredible as the Interrogator.  The set was perfect and the music really defined the action - it was great.  I thought it was anything but boring - I was mesmerized from beginning to end.  Please pay attention to the message of this film - just like children make easy victims, so do people who don't speak out about governmental abuse of citizens.  As the message says at the end of the film....""over half the world's governments continue to use torture against their own citizens"".  It's a frightening thought.

Alan Rickman  although being the interigator was very screen worthy in this movie. The scene where he was more than 2 people was amazingly well done.

432289,5,6302135397,"The first time I saw this film I was repulsed and blown away by the brutality endured by the female prisoner. On repeated viewings I have been blown away by the subtle changes in each character. The acting in this two-person story is first-rate. Alan Rickman brings many layers of complexity to his character, the interrogator, who is as profoundly changed by the experience as is the prisoner. Although the story and subject matter are difficult to view, the acting is so fine that I find myself drawn back to the VCR and the tape for one more look.

Oh, yes, the movie. This movie is very, very emotional. It's about a gvmt. interrogator who accuses a writer of children's books of putting political propoganda in her books. LOTS of madness ensues. There are only two people in this movie, Alan Rickman (Interrogator) and Madeline Stowe (Victim). The Interrogator tries to break the Victim into admitting that she's putting political stuff in her books throughout the whole movie. Now, this may sound like boring suff, but the script and the acting and the story is so superb that the one and a half hours actually goes by quickly, with the viewer wanting to watch more.
Alan Rickman does an Oscar caliber job as the Interrogator. At first, he's calm and ""kind"" to the Victim; soon, he starts to break down. The scene where the Interrogator pretends to be two people at once shows SHEER ACTING TALENT.
Madeline Stowe is equally good as the victim, and the monologue she does inside the closet toward the end of the film was so well done the viewer could visualize everything she was talking about, and it's as if you were there.
However, this movie is very disturbing, with scenes of violence, and references to rape and abuse. It's one intense ride from beginning to end. This is psychological drama to the max, and it's deeply though provoking, disturbing, and talent-filled.
Don't miss your chance to get this movie! Or else, you probably will never see it again, except on obscure websites, selling for fifty bucks. Which is still worth it, but take the chance to get it on Amazon... while you still can.",1013817600,58,1562,4.7463235294117645

In ways  Closetland  like these other films are mirror in a carnival house, presenting a  distorted reality which suggests anothing aspect to reality you could not  possibly imagine.

There is depth  to things in your life now, motives and incentives tangible in your  everyday existence.  You come to understand things in a new way because of  all the experiences in different dimensions of the same world.  You soon  become a new person, dare I say, a better person.
