2883953,5,B000SAD8MO,"I must thank Deimos DVD for finally making this sexy horror favorite of my youth available in such a beautifully preserved and presented form. It's taken awhile, but I knew it would happen eventually and now it is here.

If you grew up in Southern California, Night of the Sorcerers (aka La Noche de los Brujos) was a regularly run Spanish origin horror film, usually popping up on channel 13 or 9. I have even seen it more recently on the spanish language channels. Yes, the plot is silly. Yes, the dubbing is atrocious. It's even kind of dull in spots. But if you've ever seen it, I doubt you can forget it.

Written and directed by the late Amando de Ossorio (Tombs of the Blind Dead, Fangs of the Living Dead), this voodoo/vampire hybrid is gory, sexy, stupid, scary, dream-like and unintentionally funny all at once. Ossorio often references his other films in his movies, and here it's no exception (the ending will remind many of the finale in Fangs). However, I don't mean to say the film is derivative. It's actually very unique. Certainly, it's  wonderfully trashy, even after all these years.

The full-screen image quality is outstanding- the HD transfer is flawless. Bright, vivid color and crisp, clear, sharp detail. You can either pick dubbed english sound or original Spanish with or without subtitles. Extras include a theatrical trailer (!), alternate scenes, spanish language titles and a still gallery. I'm a little aware of some online controversy regarding the ""uncutness"" of this new Deimos/BCI release. All I will say, having seen the other versions, is that I am very happy with this edition.

While I doubt this will be appearing on the Oxygen network anytime soon, it is certainly a must buy for any Euro-horror buff. What are you waiting for?!?",1188000000,18,1773,4.819078947368421
2883954,3,B000SAD8MO,"A Spanish vampire filem (La Noche de los brujos), set in Africa, it has a touch of voodoo and S&M about it.

Starting some years earlier, the film has a woman attacked by an African tribe where she's whipped and then beheaded and then returns as a vampire.

Jumping to the present a small group of people camp near-by and one by one the women of the group are drawn to the same sacrifice area where they are tied up, whipped until their clothes are in tatters and then bitten to become vampires.

As a vampire, the pale woman skips about in poorly lit jungle wearing a tiger-fur bikini (see woman on front cover)... where they got these from is not known.

That's pretty much the film there. One by one women become bikini-wearing paled vampires leaping about in slow motion.",1183593600,16,775,4.475177304964539
2883955,3,B000SAD8MO,A different twist on the vampire scene. Beautiful women find strange zombies and a woman dressed in leopard skin outfit only to thirst for their blood. one great scene where a beautiful victim is whipped and clothing torn from her body only dangling from the ropes she is bound with to have her neck bitten from behind by the leopard vampire woman.,1100044800,2,348,4.629032258064516
8204929,5,B000SAD8MO,This is the movie I remembered as a younger me. The story is what you would expect from a movie shot in the 70's. but it held my attention and the movie was clean and sharp. I enjoyed  the movie but it is not brain surgery.,1521504000,,223,3.847826086956522
8204930,5,B000SAD8MO,"My original concept for this review would be how the film is mostly of nostalgia value.  I first saw it back in the late 1970's.  I lived near Pittsburgh and had reached the age where I could stay up late and watch Saturday Night Live and following that, Chiller Theater, hosted by Bill ""Chilly Billy"" Cardille (outside of Pittsburgh, he's best known for a small role in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead).  I've recently learned of a good story about these two shows and hope the horror fans enjoy it.  For its first four years, Saturday Night Live was not broadcast in Pittsburgh; Chiller Theater was so popular, the NBC affiliate chose not to air SNL.  Apparently, NBC really had to put its foot down about this, so Chiller Theater was moved back an hour and a half and there were no more double features.  To return to the narrative, Night of the Sorcerers was the first film I saw on Chiller Theater and obviously, for a teenage boy it was wonderfully lurid and twisted and it stuck in the mind.  Years later, I did get a DVD version, but the film quality and dubbing were poor.  A few days ago, nostalgia hit and fellow reviewers suggested the Special Edition was the one to buy.  I watched it last night and was very pleasantly surprised.  The film looks  sharp and there are scenes that would have been cut out for TV broadcast (anyone else remember hating that caption EDITED FOR TELEVISION?)  In its full glory, Night of the Sorcerers is a fine example of low budget but effective horror.  The liner notes give some additional information about its history and development.  I concur with others who recommend buying the Special Edition for the best experience with this film;  I thought it made The Night of the Sorcerers even better than I remembered.",1504828800,,1770,4.592356687898089

8204934,4,B000SAD8MO,"When I'm watching an 'exploitation' style movie I generally re-adjust my critical thinking accordingly and my criteria may include some specific peculiarities that don't normally pertain to 'serious' cinematic analysis. Accordingly, my review & rating for ""The Night of the Sorcerers' isn't based on holding it up for comparison to the likes of 'Citizen Kane', but more simply: did it 'work' within the context of the genre. From that perspective I'd heartily proclaim: ""Hell, yeah!"" I'd have to say that a previous reviewer did a pretty good job of extolling the virtues of what this mid 70's Spanish horror flik has to offer - basically some over the top supernatural action and attractive women shedding their clothes and running around in the jungle with with big fangs and tiny leopard skin bikinis. I often judge 'how good/sexy' an exploitation film is going to be by how long one has to wait for the first sight of a naked breast on screen. By that standard 'Night of the Sorcerers' should be 'Oscar' level fare as, barely five minutes into the plot, you have the spectacle of a woman tied to a tree by a tribe of chanting 'African' natives who then remove her clothes with a bullwhip!, rape her, and sacrifice her by be-heading so that she can be reborn as a vampiric leopard woman who roams the jungle for prey! After this 'stunning' opening sequence, the plot settles down to focus on a group of 'animal rights activists' who are in Africa - a couple of guys and three gorgeous women. One by one the girls get lured off to suffer the same fate as witnessed in the opening scene - stripped and sacrificed by a group of zombie natives who rise from their graves at night until only one couple is left alive for the film's 'surprise' ending. This film is pure 'cheeze' from beginning to end and that's exactly what makes it so mindlessly engaging. The 'Special Edition' package put together by the Eclipse DVD authoring group is very nice! The film transfer quality is super clean and it would appear to have all of its' 'sexy' scenes intact - LOTS of toplessness (but no full frontal). There is a nice insert booklet included that gives info on the background of the film and its' director, Amando De Ossorio. The 'extras' include some production & promo stills and 'alternate' scenes where the actors are 'clothed' - in order to meet censorship codes in certain countries. It is refreshing that on this disk the more explicit version w/ nudity intact is what you get on the principle disc - I have other Spanish 'Franco era' vintage films where it is the opposite and one must search the extras to see the excised 'skin' shots. If you're looking for some pure outrageous exploitation weirdness - this is a good pick! I've noticed that there is a 'version' of this film available from the Sinister Cinema folks at a much lower price - having not viewed it I can't really say how it compares in terms of picture quality and/or 'completeness' - but I can definitely recommend the Eclipse version.",1323993600,3,3002,4.676748582230624
8204935,5,B000SAD8MO,"Kudos for Deimos DVD! I have been trying to find this movie on DVD for the past 2-3 years with no luck in sight. This movie is so hard to find & I got lucky with Amazon.com. Just finshed watching it & I must say I am impressed! Since it was mastered in high definition from the orginal negitive I could not belive how vivid the colour is & sharpness of the picture clarity was. I remember seeing once on brodcast TV back in 1975 & I never saw it again. If you are a fan of European cult classic hooror movies this one is a must have for any DVD library. It's scary, dark, atmospheric & very sexy!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salem-s-Lot/dp/0790742829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salem's Lot</a>",1299283200,,734,4.975609756097561
8204936,1,B000SAD8MO,"This version is not the special edition that the other reviews are discussing. THAT one is OOP and costs quite a bit.
This is the old TV print, with all of the vampire action cut out and terrible print quality. Do NOT waste your money.

Amazon has done its old idiotic trick of porting the same reviews to different editions of things, so this review shows up under the Special Edition and the DVD on demand Amazon does, which is the garbage I refer to in my review. If the title doesn't say Night Of The Sorcerers: SPECIAL EDITION, stay away! It's likely to be the bad old degenerated print w/cuts .",1271894400,11,600,4.357142857142857
8204937,5,B000SAD8MO,"I liked a lot this film. It is very original, it places the vampires in an unpublished universe (the jungle, the voodoo) and contains numerous spectacular scenes. There are many new developments and suspense , a pleasant moment !",1233792000,,229,4.897435897435898
8204938,5,B000SAD8MO,"A group of explorers arrive to study the wildlife in the same area a brutal murder happened in 1910.  Nobody cares and, of course, things start to happen to them.  Mostly at night when the guys asked to keep watch over the camp are either making out or sleeping.  Easy camp to sneak into, really.  Anyway, people are killed, the sexy Spanish actresses end up as vampires, dressed up in skins, running slow motion through the jungle, jiggling the whole way and things get weird.  You get the picture.  Witchcraft, vampires, sexy women, stupid men.  Heavily armed men, but pretty stupid and easy to distract.
Loved the alternate footage, the still gallery, and the insert of liner notes.  Sometimes it was hard to see what was going on because most of the night scenes were really day scenes with filters and stuff.  But the film was still fun to watch.  In a twisted, B-movie, half-clad vampire women kind of way.",1214870400,3,912,4.64375
