8569749,5,B00BJNY3RI,"This is such a cute movie. Rarely do I find movies that I have the desire to watch more than once, but this is one of them.",1470528000,,123,3.5925925925925926
8569750,5,B00BJNY3RI,"I first saw this movie on a flight from Brisbane to Taiwan back in 2007 and have been after this film ever since! A real hard find until I spotted it here on Amazon some 8 years later. Very pleased with the find! Now, if I could only get it on Blu-ray.....",1448496000,,256,3.9423076923076925
8569751,4,B00BJNY3RI,This movie is very funny. I enjoy watching it.,1408579200,,46,4.222222222222222
8569752,4,B00BJNY3RI,The story premise was cute and also sent the message that physical appearance is not the most important thing to see in a person but it is what they are like inside that counts!  Particularly liked how Joo Jin-Mo's character came to realize this fact!,1400457600,,251,4.5777777777777775
8569753,5,B00BJNY3RI,"I gave it five ratings, because it has comedy and drama, funny at times and sort of sad other times.  Great movie to watch with your family. I was not able to get it on blu ray, my only disappointment. Would highly recommend it. Delivered as stated.",1381190400,,249,4.297872340425532
8569754,1,B00BJNY3RI,"I thought this would be good; this is a good idea; this is an idea hard to mess up, but they did. I MEAN YOU NEED A TRUCK TO MESS THIS UP, but they did.

Soooo, ssslowww, and BORING!!!!

The only thing that occurs to me is the director just got totally enamored of his own obsession here---maybe with the silly star, who cannot act, by the way. Her style consists of silly-looking simpering and infantile mugging. I mean, somebiody this dumb could not run a can opener.

I turned it off at 40 minutes. Too silly and inept a movie for words. The scriopt would be great alone; this director needs punishment. I won't even apologize for not finding ANYthing redeeming.",1378598400,,665,4.434426229508197
8569755,5,B00BJNY3RI,"This movie crosses all cultural boundaries with a universal message. Plus, the music kicks butt! I re-watch this movie every month or so, and always seem to find something new that teaches me even more.",1369526400,3,202,4.8
