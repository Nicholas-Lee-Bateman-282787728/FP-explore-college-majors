8738711,1,B017DG5UGM,"I'm an experienced woodworker and luthiery graduate of a well-known Pacific university and cannot recommend this because of his most basic error - he does NOT use scarf joints for the peg head! This is a fundamental mistake, misinformation for beginners, contrary to provide instrument construction techniques, and most important will leave you with an instrument that will break. That's right, build like this and over time the peg head will snap right off . Our school repair shop teaches this as an example of what NOT to do. The scarf joint is an essential every instrument builder learns, see the Bible of guitar making, the Cumpiano book, page 43. He also spends way to much time on things that are so basic they end up looking like filler. For example he spends an hour just squaring up the blank, just filler to justify the disk. As for the claims of using hand tools, well he does use them, and then in the middle looks straight into the camera and says ""...but i ended up hating this. Now lets use a bandsaw"". For hand planes he tells you ""... this is a Chinese copy, but good enough"" ... the first woodworking presentation anywhere that endorses using substandard tools. There is of course the obligatory plunky guitar music background in minor chords everywhere to let you know This Is An Artiste. But this whole thing feels like a filler, something you will never watch twice and a real disappointment. Save your money, get the Cumpiano book instead. I'm donating this to our school library so curious students don't make the same mistake in buying it.",1508457600,,1565,4.7153284671532845
