2235436,3,B0007R4SWM,"I have been following SFU as it has been released on DVD. I have to say that I am not a fan of Season 3. It has become a bit soap-opera-ish. Season 1 and 2 made you think and relfect on each episode, and the person who died in it, and what you could learn from their death. This one seems to have forgotten that; with the characters being two dimensional. I hope it picks up in Season 4.

Saying that, I still think this is an awesome series.",1114300800,6,442,3.966292134831461
2235437,4,B0007R4SWM,"Six Feet Under is one of my favorite shows - I love the writing; the realistic, flawed, and very likeable characters; the storylines; and the great acting. Watching 6FU on DVD is really the way to go - you watch on YOUR schedule - no more waiting a week for new episodes.

If you haven't seen Season 3 yet, I won't ruin the surprises that are in store for you, I will just try to set up what happens.

The first episode resolves the cliff-hanger from Season 2 regarding Nate's brain surgery.  The episode also fast-forwards a few months, and we see the Fisher family having gone through some changes.  Nate's situation is very different now - Brenda is out of the picture, and Nate's daughter Maya is a bigger part of his life.  In Season 2, Lisa moved to LA to have Nate's baby, and in Season 3 she is a regular character on the show.  She and Nate go through some interesting stuff, and later in Season 3, Brenda shows up and complicates things.

At the end of Season 2, David and Keith were together again, but having rough spots; now they are going to couples counseling to work on their issues.  Ruth is now newly single, having left Nikolai the florist, and there's ample room in her life for a new friendship with an eccentric character played by Kathy ""I'm your number one fan!"" Bates.  Ruth's love life also gets some attention in Season 3.  At the end of Season 2, Claire was just about to start art school; in season 3, her storylines revolve around art school, another student, and a teacher there.  By the end of Season 3, just about everyone is at a crossroads.

Like Seasons 1 and 2, Season 3 has plenty of very dramatic, emotional scenes that are so well-written and so well-acted, they really make you FEEL what these characters are feeling.  For us viewers, the experience of seeing them suffer is visceral.

But unlike Seasons 1 and 2, season 3 doesn't have as much dark, quirky humor (like in Season 1 when Ruth accidentally took the ecstasy that David hid in the aspirin bottle).  I missed this.

The first half of Season 3 is a bit uneven - some episodes and storylines are great, others feel like filler to keep things moving along.  The second half is really great, compelling, like a great page-turner that you don't want to end.  Be warned: the last 4 episodes, while riveting and incredibly well-acted, contain some pretty depressing stuff.  Also be warned that the last episode's very last scene, while excellent, will leave you wanting more.

One thing I loved about Seasons 1 and 2 was the epiphanies or transformative growth that one of the main characters would sometimes experience as a result of their interactions with the families of the people that die at the beginning of each episode.  This happens much less in Season 3, unfortunately.  However, toward the end of the season, Nate starts seeing connections between his own situation and that of the families of the deceased.  And in the last episode, there's an extended scene involving Claire, her deceased father, and other characters in Heaven (don't worry - Claire's not dead) that brings a sense of resolution to a number of storylines that had been kind of left open, and is really quite beautiful.

All things considered, I definitely recommend Season 3, but the first half of the season is not quite up to the standard of excellence set by Seasons 1 and 2.",1112572800,17,3354,4.5889261744966445
2235438,5,B0007R4SWM,I have long believed that SFU was the best written/acted show on television (excuse me-it's not television it's HBO).  In the opinion of a rabid fan season three was the last really primo season for this masterpiece program.  Season four was so forced it was just lost in space.  It wandered aimlessly until Lisa's body was found (ding dong the bitch is dead!) and Nate got himself beaten senseless to demonstrate his guilt.  Back to season three.  I believe it was the best of SFU and I will ad it to my collection of seasons one and two when released in May.  I have no plans to watch season five when it begins in June.  Season four destroyed my interest in this superb series and I am truly saddened. This is one program which should have ended after season three. It's sad when producers drag a story line out beyond it's logical and qualitative end point for the sake of money. I have canceled HBO because I can't bear to watch season five drag it down further and SFU was the only reason I subscribed to HBO in the first place. At least I'll soon have the last of the best three seasons to enjoy as reminders of one of the top five shows of all time.,1112486400,4,1157,4.304147465437788
2235439,5,B0007R4SWM,"Season three starts out with a bang. The first episode shows a completely different life for the protagonist Nate. For the rest of the Fisher family everything is different too. To start off Rico has become a partner and Claire has started art-school. Ruth is getting fed up with Nikolai. The season's main brilliance comes in its incredibe developement of all the characters. Although it's sad to see Claire out of highschool, without her shrink, without Parker  McKennough, she goes through a major transition through her interactions with Russel and other art school friends. Ruth becomes close with Bettina (played by Kathy Bates) who is looking after her sister while she gets rid of a Vocodin addiction. Brenda is seeking help for her sexual addiction.

The brilliance of the show is only furthered for the characters as this season appears to be a season of transition in their lives.

The cast continues to rock out in this season and Alan Ball and Laurence Andries continue to kick ass with their intense cinematography and beautifully crafted Los Angeles landscapes. Unlike many shows that depict California as a land of promise Six Feet Under portrays it in it's independant apathetic reality. The show also shows how the landscape as affected it's characters, mainly Brenda and Claire.",1111881600,10,1297,5.0514018691588785
2235440,4,B0007R4SWM,"While the 3rd season did not have the same ""Punch"" as 1,2 & 4, It is still better than anything else on TV. Season 3 must be watched to understand and enjoy 4.

I just started re-watching season 3 on Cable ""On Demand"".

I really love Lily Taylor's charecter. What is she doing now? Voice-overs for tv commercials? I'm sad about the end of this show.",1109808000,4,349,4.2727272727272725
2235441,5,B0007R4SWM,"To wait even 3 more months to see this collection of, not just HBO's finest series, but television's finest as well, is driving me absolutely mad.

Season one was AMAZING, it introduces you to charecters, it displays all of the elements that makes the show what it is, the humor, Its seriousness, the incredible and unpredictable storytelling, the charisma of everyone on screen, etc..etc...you cannot help but fall in love with these people.

Season two is also amazing, for the same reasons, however I think the first season is more enjoyable to me, because of the newness, getting to know everyone, etc...season 2 is breathtaking though, and it leaves you hanging at the end.

Season three...WOW. I think the show hit its peak here, because not only does it hold onto the strengths, but it begins to turn into a new phase of the show. Where season one was fresh because of its newness, this one is fresh because of it taking such a turn. I believe this season displays the transitional episodes, that make it a different show for season 4 and continues throughout 4. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen 3, but those who have seen it, know where Im going with this...and that is that this season REALLY tugs at the heart. I have never gotten into television shows OR movies like I have with this show, and personally, this season.

I CANNOT wait for season 5...and for those of you who are dreading the shows end with season 5...like me...understand, every series television show going past 4 or 5 seasons, looses alot of staying power. Six Feet Under has staying power, but I think it will stay on top if they don't try to kill it.

With DVD release, we will have an epic story to cherish.

Heres to season 5!!!!!",1108684800,14,1724,4.5811688311688314
2235442,5,B0007R4SWM,"The third season of SFU is also memorable for a unique reason: it's the season in which the writers merged reality with their fictional storyline by incorporating the real-life Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles into five episodes. Hear David sing a solo with the choristers, watch them party at brunch with Keith, bury an opera designer, dodge paint-balls, then rehearse and perform some more. When the shows were first aired, even the LA Times praised the inclusion of these real chorus members, calling the brave casting ""the 'real' reality television."" (And yes, the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles has terrific CDs available for sale on Amazon, though for the record, the real GMCLA has 200 singers, not just the 16 characters on SFU.)

2235462,3,B0007R4SWM,"Through two seasons, it was entertaining; corpses aside, the acting was great. Borderline necrophobes have little to fear, but raw language and sex (gay and straight) will cross the line for prudes and homophobes. Episodes are amply supplied with fodder such as neurotics, psychotics, romance, religion, and soul searching. That said, edges soon dulled. I found nothing to justify continuing through season 3 and barely managed to finish the third episode.",1503360000,2,456,5.436619718309859

2235500,5,B0007R4SWM,"Though it may not seem so when the season begins, this is a pivotal twist in the lives of the Fisher family. The season begins with the startling idea that Nate and Lisa have married and are happily living together raising their daughter Maya. Ruth seems obsessed with her granddaughter and is often at odds with Lisa and Nate in her daily care, but generally, everyone seems to be moving forward. Even Claire. However, all is only stable on the surface--there are discontents and disruptions simmering just below that, like lava from a quiet volcano, will eventually erupt. Yet, as the season moves along, even though things go a bit slowly at times, the viewer is left wondering more and more often how and when. It is toward the end of this cycle that the bombshells all drop--and they are horrid. When the dust from these settle, the family and everyone around them are in disarray and will never, ever be the same again. Hearts must mend, rifts must close--but there is a long road ahead for the Fishers in order to see any of this happen. Season 3 ushers in the darkest and most dramatic episodes coming, in Season 4--and you'll need to keep the tissue box handy more than once. It's riveting television, but it's sometimes a bit depressing to watch--which is what makes this show all the more realistic and poignant.",1485561600,2,1323,4.6581196581196584

The characters were well developed and interesting. I just wish that Hollywood would relinquish their love affair with both smoking and using f*** as every other word in every characters dialogue. Neither adds to the story at all. In fact, In my opinion, it detracts attention from the story because hearing the  F bomb being bandied about so often gets tiring.

2235556,5,B0007R4SWM,I find all the characters interesting and very real in many of their daily struggles. The acting is exceptional with never a dull moment to be had. The writers are to be congratulated on their mixture of real life emotional issues mixed with fractured personalities of those that they interact with on a daily basis. I can see many of these scenarios unfolding in similar fashion when given like-minded situational experiences.,1481846400,,427,5.028169014084507

the finale conclusion was something I have never seen before on TV. It was disturbingly brilliant. I felt my attachment to the characters ebb away into some weird sorrow as they all got headlined into the white.
sadness is a strong emotion not well developed on TV,, and seldom works, but it was well done here.

2235631,5,B0007R4SWM,"This show has no signs of aging or being out of date. In short, it was ahead of it's time. Since this season starts out with the absence of Brenda, the character who drives me crazy, it's a plus for me. Her story line in the first two seasons wore me out. With Nate and Lisa living with her boss, played by Catherine O'Hara, there is a new element of neurotic behavior that a comedic treasure even though O'Hara plays her character straight, not for laughs. The comedy comes from an over-the-top persona of a Hollywood talent agent who is so ""ME, ME, ME!""

There are some story lines that hint at potential growth for some characters, but the underlying dysfunction between the core characters is the engine that drives the show. Both are good things in my opinion and what makes it a cutting edge drama.",1473120000,,804,4.469387755102041

Would love to see HBO revisit the show, even if it's just in the form of a TV movie. But I would prefer to see a sixth season.

Heck, Fox brought back The X-Files for a tenth season to great success after being off the air for 14 years (not counting the follow-up 2nd movie in 2008). So why not? I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels that way.

I don't want to introduce spoilers (you can find them in other reviews if you want them), but to me the overarching plot line of S3 was off the mark and took the show in a bizarre, less believable and less enjoyable direction.

The 5 seasons give us enough time to see what the family is going through and the show finale is probably one of the best show finales ever.

The only person I liked was Claire. Nate is the worst person ever, he should of just died for how he is. He is so egocentric, unfAithful and disrespectful. He is the main buzz killer of this show. Lisa was nice but so weak her life revolves around toxic Nate for practically a decade as she mentions. Grow some ovaries and move on. I liked Rico until this season. Kieth is too good for David even though I felt like his character's personality changed a lot from season 1, he got super aggro and basically becAme a different character. Brenda is just annoying and disappointing as always, this neighbor guy is too good for her.",1450051200,,789,4.563380281690141

Interesting and great character development,however once you get to season three you'll find that the characters which  you learned to love during season two and three, become very distorted.

So, even if I never saw this show in its actual run, I am glad to catch up on it.  After all, Casablanca is an old movie, but people are just discovering it all the time and enjoying it.

I will tell you this.  I dread the day I watch the last episode, however I will not want to stop myself.",1449014400,,409,4.05

2236128,5,B0007R4SWM,"Having first been a DEXTER fan...I knew of this series but did not watch until it appeared with all 5 seasons available on Netflix.  What a treat...I was in DEXTER withdrawals!  The opening music has me ""spellbound"" every time I hear it...what an intriguing collection of images and music!  Hats off to the brilliant creators...one and all!  The cast has become my ""new family"" and I look forward to visiting with them each evening for at least 3 episodes.  One keeps leading to another...it is ADDICTIVE to say the least!  Without revealing too much...let me just say that I've learned more about the mortuary business than I might care to know...and that environment is conducive to creating a family of ""eccentrics""...to put it mildly!  I love it and will be sad when I finally view Season 5, Episode 12.  So if you're in the mood to see something that is ""unique""...albeit a soap opera...it holds both laughter and horror.  You're in for a ""good ride"" with each episode.",1444176000,,974,4.75

2236285,5,B0007R4SWM,"A masterful work of fiction!  Please Lord, tell me these characters are all fictional and no one actually does any of this stuff for real.  This series is a work of cyclic mistakes and bad decisions by characters who you want to love but quickly begin to hate because of their own destructive behavior.  This show makes me so very happy that I have been blissfully married for 29 years.  Thats 29 years without ever having children, without abusing drugs (recreational or pharmaceutical), without abusing alcohol and without abusing each other (physically or psychologically). This show makes me so very happy to have been raised an only child by simple, loving parents who did not analyze, criticize, demean, or play strange psychological games in order to entertain themselves.  This show makes me so happy that both my wife and I are introverts who rarely socialize with people other than very, very close family members - and only on rare occasions!",1438819200,,953,4.93125

I don't think there is any better TV series for the depth of issues examined or for character development.  It also features good acting and is well written.  The language and topics were very avant-garde at the time and seem current even now. The trademark opening sequence where someone dies in a way that then becomes a theme for that episode is still compelling and never gets stale. The technical quality is not up to today's standards (for example, there are no closed captions) but the Season 1 box format has yielded to wide screen format.",1438214400,,626,4.522123893805309

According to Allen Ball the writer (also the writer of American Beauty) everything is carnal and driven by narcissistic appetite. Watching is completly voyeuristic on my part. I'm trying to learn something about this point of view. Why did American Beauty win the hearts and minds at the Academy? I hated American Beauty. Both American Beauty and this program are cruel to it's audience. I understand validating the ugly but I don't get building a career on the myopic. Story is way more important than one's ability to crush. I think it's just bad story.",1435968000,,660,4.849557522123894

2236439,2,B0007R4SWM,The show started out a lot of fun with a good balance of humor and serious snippets.  Third season just seemed to go all gay all the time.  I didn't have a problem with him being gay but I do have a problem with having to be constantly bombarded with gay sex scenes and kissing and pouting.  And poor Nate just seems to be a zombie with his Controling girlfriend/wife.  Seems like the writers are just bogged down and can't move on.,1431648000,,432,4.2317073170731705
2236440,5,B0007R4SWM,"This is my second time around watching this series.
 Alan Ball's (producer) name is attached to some very good productions: American Beauty (writer), True Blood (producer) and Banshee (producer).
The writing is crisp, the story lines are tight and there's enough off-beat quirkiness in Six Feet Under to keep it a cut above.
Good stuff. Worth watching more than once.",1431648000,,367,5.116666666666666

I usually really dislike anything resembling raunchy, but the honesty that pours out of the very real people portrayed here has me addicted. Ruth, who cannot keep stray men out of her bed, is especially touching as a woman who married too young, had no life of her own, and now grows beyond her narrow world to achieve a real personhood. the character portrayed by Kathy Bates is a casual shoplifter, a leftover hippie, a mess. But also a stalwart friend and compassionat4e, no nonsense caregiver. This show is one of the only shows on TV to portray older women as more than caricatures.",1429315200,,654,4.745614035087719

2236565,4,B0007R4SWM,"Love simply isn't the word I would use for this show. Don't get me wrong, it's a good show. The characters are well acted, the messy dynamics between them leaves you reflecting on it well after an  episode ends. My issue is with the plot that has a bad habit of trying to bring you full circle but won't... Yet? On to the next season.",1425945600,,334,4.138461538461539

2236572,5,B0007R4SWM,It gets better and better which is hard to do given the high level of the first two seasons. The emotional rollercoaster continues. It is easy to become addicted to this series if you find yourself involved with the characters. It is hard to avoid hope and dreams as the story progresses. That's the point at which you know you are hooked. This is not an escape from reality as much as situations may be compressed for dramatic purposes. The relationships continue to reflect reality and the gay themes are an entere for audiences unfamiliar with the realities of gay culture.,1425945600,,576,4.712871287128713
2236573,4,B0007R4SWM,"The experience of Six Feet Under is about taking the entire journey.

2236661,5,B0007R4SWM,"There is so much pain, so much dysfunction in all of these characters--yet you can't help hoping that things will work out for them because the actors and writers do such a terrific job of making them fallible human beings who are basically good at the core (well, except for Brenda's parents, and maybe Olivier). It is hard to separate one season from the next because the series is so addictive and when you have finished watching one season, you MUST dive right into the next one.",1425081600,,483,4.563218390804598

What a bunch of self-absorbed, maladjusted, and frankly in a couple cases sociopathic personality types.  Nate can't get his head out of adolescence, Clair is cacooned in her own shield of rebellion/self esteem issues, David's continued homosexuality angst rings hollow with most of my friends in the gay community, and.....well, I could go on, but chose not to spend any more time on this review or the series!

Some of them were quite funny, like the man who ran over himself on his drive way while trying to pick up the paper off the drive as he backed up.  All the characters were well developed and well portrayed.  Many characters were visited by a ghost of past family members.  If your uncomfortable watching any romantic gay scenes, this is not for you.  An interesting story about more than one dysfunctional family.  A character for everyone.  I was drawn to all of them as the story line progressed.  I enjoyed the season finale and how it wrapped up everyone's future.",1424736000,,733,4.492424242424242

If you don't like seeing gay people make out/ make love, this show may not be for you. Don't get me wrong, this show is about other things, but some people may not like certain scenes.

The  production of this show on the whole is spotless. One enters into watching this family go through maybe 10 years of their lives. One watches each character go through their ups,downs, and we watch them grow up or maybe not grow at all?  But we also see the ups and downs they go through as a family.

2237146,3,B0007R4SWM,"I enjoyed this program through the first and second seasons.  I was charmed by such a quirky soap.  It seems to me that in season 3, most of the quirky is gone and we are left with a pretty conventional soap with a couple of dead people thrown in.  BTW, I was never sure when Nate came back from the dead.  And now everyone is so perfectly disfunctional that I have trouble knowing who to dislike most.  But I keep watching and hoping.  Surely in season 4 we will start to tie up a few loose ends.",1413676800,,497,4.072164948453608

2237150,1,B0007R4SWM,"Seasons one and two were awesome. Dark comedy; clever scripts; satire; the final episode had not one but several cliff hangers, not the least of which was Nate's surgery. I couldn't wait to start Season Three. And there it was: Nate's tombstone; Nate's name with birth and death dates; scenes with the dead Nate, Sr. But wait! No, Nate, Jr wasn't dead. He survived. He was changed. He wanted to be a husband and a daddy so he married Lisa - eco-Nazi Lisa. Psycho Brenda was cast aside. Brenda's brother Billy was safely away in a psych hospital. Claire was in art school. And, David had moved in with Keith. Everyone was in a deep, dull middle class rut. Boring scripts. Eco-nazi Lisa doing her passive-aggressive moves on Nate. At least there was Lisa's self-centered, demanding boss Carol but she had only one line: Somebody parked in my driveway.

I kept hoping that suddenly there would be a show where everyone showed up a Nate's funeral and we would learn that this horrible depiction of their lives was simply a dream. Nate was really dead; everyone would continue in their dark, macabre psychotic lives. Never happened.  Finally, on a solo drive from LA to visit her sister, Lisa disappeared. I held my breath. Would the eco-nazi just go away? Please. Could something redeem this whole season? Or, would she reappear as a sheep farmer in the mountains and fight for custody of Maya. I feared the latter - that we would be cursed with Lisa forever.  But .... NO!!! Redemption. The phone call saying a body had been found washed up on the coast and had been identified from Lisa's dental records. There is a god - even in Six Feet Under.

I had resolved to not even begin season four unless some dramatic turn-around occurred. So here it was, finally. It will be with great trepidation but some hope that I will begin season four. Maybe, just maybe, the scripts will improve; the original characters will return; and I can enjoy watching SFU once again. Wait for my review of Season Four.",1413676800,,1994,4.640226628895184

2237276,5,B0007R4SWM,"If I could, I would give this series 20 stars.  Recently I purchased the Amazon Fire TV system (it took 3 minutes to get it up and running).  I started to scroll through the Amazon Prime TV series and I found HBO's SIX FEET UNDER.  I started to watch, and I could not stop.  The series ran from 2001-2005.  What an amazing cast!!  Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Lauren Ambrose, Rachel Griffiths, Matthew St. Patrick, and Frances Conroy lead an outstanding ensemble.  I was hooked on it after the first 5 minutes.  I'm still watching.  I would make one recommendation.  I have found that Amazon's version is around 795 minutes;  the actual HBO release is almost 1400 minutes.  The HBO version is about 25 dollars more, but you will get the full series, unedited -- and you will not want to miss a minute of it.  At first, Amazon Fire TV was showing the complete series, but a couple of days ago they switched over to the edited version -- so I purchased the series directly from HBO.  I'll continue to watch it on Amazon Fire -- but my wife and I are going to watch the whole series all over again when the dvd's arrive.  The acting is so good that you actually find yourself getting  caught up with the story.  It's a Drama, but also a Comedy.  Rarely do you find such a !!well written, well acted series.

Be advised there is a good bit of intimate contact in every episode (its HBO!) so put the kids to bed, put your feet up and prepare to enjoy this clever series.

The only character I really like is Brenda's as played by Jeremy Sisto. But this is a tribute to the excellent acting of the entire ensemble.

I remember watching when this was ""on HBO"" and wondering why Nate ever got married.  The pregnancy and Mia was more watchable when he had to juggle between deciding if he was going to be a father or a deadbeat dad.  It would have been better had he need to juggle with funerals and watching his kid that he signed off all parental rights to.

Hopefully season 4 will get better.  I can't remember so its new again to me. If not, I'll put 6-feet under me and move on to something else.",1407196800,,580,4.26605504587156

The summer TV lineup is not very interesting and gives me a couple of hours each night to find out what is store for the members of the Fisher family. Kathy Bates is a frequent character on the series and adds a lot of comedy to her episodes. The ""F"" word is somewhat over used but not a deal breaker. Everyone seems to have enough money for drinks and drugs but live at home or in a shared apartment. You just think your family has issues until you spend a few hours with ""Six Feet Under"".",1406937600,,668,4.395161290322581

Parents of those two had no personality whatsoever, but needed for the story. As a 67-:-Old woman with four children, and five grandchildren, I could so relate to Ruth. Loved the house setting however. Rico ruled and ruined his life with his genitals as did Nate. The little girl was adorable. Don't even want to mention the narcissistic daughter. Pew.

A wonderful tale, well written, but with too much gratuitous sex and F bombs.  I don't know a family with that level of sophistication that talks using the F bomb every other sentence.  It's offensive to many. Still, the story is much stronger than the weakness of the gratuitous sexual scenes and the F bombs.  This season will leave you wanting to watch the next one.",1403308800,,470,4.4941176470588236

A very mature, very risque, extremely entertaining and informative show that begs to be continued ASAP by Alan Ball and friends. Makes low-rate crap shows like ""Keeping Up with the KarTrashians"" look like the tenth-rate garbage that they are (what brain-dead class of moronic idiots actually watch these shows anyway?)

2237812,4,B0007R4SWM,"This is an adult series and a dark, oftentimes emotionally disturbing look at a quirky, dysfunctional family.  It should not be viewed by those expecting a comedy, as it is often very depressing.  Two patriarchs are presented as the ""villains"" responsible for their dysfunctional offspring.  Ruth Fisher, played by Frances Conroy, can perhaps be forgiven for being a sullen, fatalistic, and terrible (but loving) mother.  We learn enough about her upbringing to believe that she is a product of terrible parenting, and only perpetuates a vicious cycle of dysfunctional parenting.  Margaret Chenowith, on the other hand (played by Joanna Cassidy) is a manipulative ""bitch"" who appears to be evil by conscious intent.  For instance, she casually tells her pregnant daughter that she considered aborting her.  Fortunately, the last episode (Season 5, episode 12) is heartening, but still a continuation of the overall theme that life is often an ugly trip.",1403136000,,953,5.3133333333333335

2237948,2,B0007R4SWM,"I wish I had read the reviews here before we bought season 3.

If, like us, you have come late to the Six Feet Under party then this may help you save some time and money. The series really does change with season 3. It pretty well abandons the technique of having the episodes relate closely to the person who dies at the beginning of a show and becomes much more (if not entirely) serial. The show is now pretty well totally about the character story arcs; indeed, there are episodes where the death at the beginning of the show plays little or no part. It is no longer a meditation on life and death (something the show and its excellent writing were famed for.)

Now, if you are big fan, you might enjoy this. But we found the writing weak and the characters less appealing than in seasons 1 and 2. Unfortunately, Lili Taylor, a well acted presence in season 2, is much less so in season 3. It wasn't until episode 8 that we really enjoyed the show again (along with the finale it was the best of a mediocre bunch.) I'm giving it a 2 rating because the final few episodes do build up the suspense, ending with a very good finale.

Well, we soldiered thru. I guess this should be expected, tho it is a shame. I remember how we were really impressed (nay, blown away) by season 1. My supervisor (Ian, a Table Officer at the Canadian House of Commons) turned me on to the show. While not as good as the standard set with the first year, we also very much enjoyed season 2.

Well, I've read the season 4 reviews and will be saving my time and money.

Heck, if you are curious, just Google the last 10 minutes of the last episode of season 5. It will tell you everything!",1351468800,3,1670,4.238993710691824

2237951,4,B0007R4SWM,"I'm racing through this series on hbo.go.  The writing is great and all of the characters are interesting in their own ways.  The difference between season 3 and the first 2 seasons is the range of emotions that I felt while watching.  In the first 2 seasons, I found that in most episodes there were scenes of sadness, hope and laughter.  I didn't feel the same way in watching this season.  This is a dark series to be sure.  But, I found that this season became much darker and I did not laugh once during any of the episodes.  There is a lot less of the Brenda storyline (including her family), especially at the beginning of the season and I found that I missed having her and her messed up family as one of the main plotlines of the show.  This is also a season where you see the main characters behaving differently than they had in the previous seasons.  This doesn't take too much away from the show, but it is a bit disconcerting that everyone's life has become much more dramatic and their behaviors erratic.  Having said that, it was still a good season and I could not stop watching.

It is certainly NOT a subject that is easily addressed.  But ---- All of us will be touched by it in some way, either now or in the future.  Bravo to HBO for having the courage to address such a subject, and make this series.

2238015,5,B0007R4SWM,"Season 3 was a very memorable season for Six Feet Under.  While they all were outstanding, it's hard to pick a favorite...but in season 3 they definitely hit their stride.

In Season 3 we got to meet some new characters and some other characters that were more 'bit parts' got a storyline of their own.  Rico is a favorite character of mine, underrated, and I was glad to see more of him.  The character of Lisa I found fascenating.  And David & Keith back together was what I'd been waiting for.  Overall it felt like the cast was becoming their character and it felt like a real family.

A great season!!  Don't miss this hit show.",1215734400,,633,4.396551724137931
2238016,5,B0007R4SWM,"It started slow, and I think that's one of the reasons why it's so great.  The first two or three episodes of this season were probably as good as any of the previous episodes, but I just felt like there was something missing from them.  Like there was something off.  I could already envision myself titling my review ""Worst Season So Far"" and I was only on the first disc.

Well, that 'off' feeling quickly turned into awe.  This season, more than anything, delves headfirst into the intricacies of the relationships between the main characters, both romantic and familial.  Never before have I seen such beautiful art created from telling stories about the daily lives of people who are at once regular and anything but.  Nate takes center stage for most of this season, becoming the 'main character' more than ever before as his new marriage with Lisa clashes with his need for personal space.  At the same time, David and Keith's relationship hits new highs and new lows, Ruth spends a lot of the season trying to find the right man for her, Federico deals with his wife's depression and his nagging sister-in-law, and Claire finally finds out what art school (and art students and teachers) are really like.

It's uncomfortable, hilarious, heart-breaking, warm, and so strange all at the same time, touching on life and death and even blurring the lines a little bit.  From the slow-boil start to the tensely climatic season finale, this is the finest season of ""Six Feet Under"" so far.

Through it all, the Fishers must sustain each other as they continue to run the difficult business of embalming and burials.

2238022,5,B0007R4SWM,"I have often heard people say that All in the Family could never be produced today. I think this is true, at least, for network television (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX). All in the Family captures a specific moment in both television and American history. Carroll O'Connor excellently renders the American bigot, Archie Bunker, and puts him up for scrutiny before a live audience. All in the Family was not entirely about political correctness and bigotry, but when you look back at the show, those social forces remain the reasons why it couldn't be produced today.

Six Feet Under, uncensored, would certainly have no chance of being broadcast either. The politically correct imperative of contemporary American culture would sue and complain it to be another ""wardrobe malfunction."" The malfunction, however, is in the emotional and intellectual dishonesty of most TV shows today, of most mainstream culture today. I think almost all of television is a cartoon. I like Six Feet Under because it is not a does not turn its homosexual characters into the prancing man-boys of Will & Grace. The violence in Six Feet Under is well earned and integral to the drama and comedy of the series. The sex and human relationships in Six Feet Under are complicated and weird, which is completely normal. Mostly, it's refreshing to watch a show that cares about story and character instead of explosions, statutory sex objects, and impossibly melodramatic events.

If All in the Family reflects a political awakening, taught through comedy, then Six Feet Under reflects a response to political correctness. The bigotry that All in the Family responds to is as monolithic and misanthropic as the political correctness Six Feet Under is responding to. Bigotry and political correctness are merely two sides of the same dishonesty; they are rules and codes for human behavior and expression that do not work out in real life. Archie Bunker was certainly not a subtle guy, but his assumptions about people different from him were wrong (and funny). Now, when everything is subtle and on politically correct eggshells, people are no longer honest. That's what Six Feet Under is about to me: We need to relearn how to trust others enough to be honest, and I think Six Feet Under accurately argues that not all honesty is mean, and avoiding confrontation isn't always nice.

In the end, HBO does with Six Feet Under what the networks used to do: Respect the intelligence, maturity, and humanity of the audience.",1171670400,,2484,4.995169082125604
2238023,2,B0007R4SWM,"The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a clich cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons.

BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing.

PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to be a little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win!",1167782400,8,2068,4.647540983606557
2238034,5,B0007R4SWM,"While the first two seasons of Six Feet Under were undeniably brilliant television, the show reached its peak in its third season, bringing existential drama to new heights and taking its character studies to further, riskier depths.

This season finds its characters richer, more complex and their situations more fascinating than they've ever been before. There are many themes that run throughout the season such as the questioning of the philosophical notions about our very existence, the choices we make and what kind of possible effect they have in shaping us into who we are and the place we occupy in life...or if our lives are summed up by a number of random circumstances that are beyond our control. I've yet to see a television series that tackles such profound material with the level of intelligence, originality and complexity Six Feet Under touches upon these themes.

As if that weren't enough, the show touches upon other fascinating themes such as relationships, the many variables that come into play and the different dynamics that drive them. Whether it be Nate and Lisa working through married life and Nate's ongoing search for purpose, love and fulfillment, or David and Keith working on their emotional baggage through terapy, these arcs remain compelling, insightful and fascinating character studies to watch.

There's also a real growth process for Claire this season as she enters art school and has an eye-opening, illuminating and sometimes painful clash with her preconceived ideas of the art world and the actual inner workings of that world, of art itself and how it changes her perception of the world.

Ruth is probably the most fun character to watch as she goes through many new experiences in her life through new friendships, emotional connection and intimacy in the most unexpected places.

There are also the arcs of Brenda trying to reconnect with her family and overcome her traumas and Rico dealing with her wife's clinical depression, all which prove equally compelling to watch.

It's simply amazing how so much human drama, how many themes such as emotional freedom, spirituality and the need for personal connection with so many interesting and different character arcs can fit into a 13-episode season, but the folks behind Six Feet Under accomplish all of this beautifully and my hat is off to Alan Ball, the creative team and the amazingly talented cast.

While I love the entire series as a whole, the third season of Six Feet Under might very well be the show's best. More sophisticated, complex and ambitious, dealing with its subjects in more thought-provoking and complex ways than before, it stands tall as the crowning jewel of one of the most brilliant television series ever made.",1151366400,9,2743,5.0553097345132745

Above all, Six Feet Under is real.  Part of the show's strength is that all of its characters are well-developed, given full expression, and none are marginalized.  We see them as they are, struggling with the questions of life that sometimes have no satisfactory solutions--and, always, we are reminded of the impermance that renders some questions unanswerable.

TRUE, THE  CHARMING HUMOR AND ODDNESS OF THE FIRST TWO SEASONS ARE GONE, BUT THE SUBTLE STORYLINES AND A PLUS ACTING MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT.  THE FINAL EPISODE IS A GEM.",1146182400,,424,4.035714285714286
2238038,5,B0007R4SWM,"Any fan of SFU would agree that there is no one ""protagonist"" in the show, while, obviously, Nate seems most important, in that SFU begins with his arrival in LA from Seattle and ends with his death almost right after his 40th birthday. Amazing on so many levels, SFU so brilliantly succeeds in showing each character with equal depth. So, it can be appreciated from any character's point of view. The depth and subtlety of character portrayal comes mainly from the script, which wastes not a word, even in introducing a character through a brief conversation of other characters (Ex. Lisa's introduction in the ""Driving Mr. Mossback"" episode in Season 2. In the plane to Seattle, Claire asks Nate: ""Is she all crunchy-granola, backpacky and way into grunge?"", to which Nate answers: ""Crunchy-granola, a little. Backpacky, definitely. Into grunge? No way. Grunge died long before Kurt Cobain did."")

In Season 3, we see much more of Lisa, a character the likes of which I don't think I have seen in other shows or movies. As Claire memorably sums up (""she's f**ked up, too. Different kind of f**ked-up, though. Almost friendly and sweet""), she has her own share of traumas and issues, which are rarely explicitly stated, yet so convincingly, almost hauntingly, acted by Lili Taylor. Usually pathetic (in both of its sense, creepy and arousing pathos), Lisa in Season 3 often sent me down the memory lane to high school, where there were Lisa in every class. Well, No, come to think of it, I think any girl with a degree of complexity has Lisa in her, along with a bit (or much) of Brenda.

Not only Lisa, and not to mention Brenda, every female character in SFU achieves a one-of-a-kind status in her own right. I have never seen women like them (Claire, Ruth, Sarah, Bettina) in a TV show, in America or in South Korea, before SFU. Season 3 is the season where some of them appear for the first time and some are explored with more depth.

One of the greatest moment of the season comes in the last ""I'm sorry, I'm lost"" episode, where Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. leads his daughter Claire to see the glimpse of afterlife. There, she sees her long-lost ex-boyfriend Gabriel, and we get to know that he is most probably dead now. This was, to me, a good closure on the part he played in Claire's life.",1144713600,6,2295,4.661728395061728
2238039,5,B0007R4SWM,"Most TV Series loose appeal after a while. This is not the case of ""Six Feet Under"", which in its third season, still retained its power and ability to move you that made it notable from day one.

The characters continue to evolve along a continuum centered around the funeral home, with at least a death per episode that they need to deal with. Sometimes deaths are close to the characters and obviously move them in expected (and sometimes unexpected) ways. Other episodes, deaths simply happen to touch their lives and souls making them question some of their most basic assumptions about life in general and how they conduct themselves.

The acting continues to be flawless, the writing close to the best I've seen on TV and the framework surrounding them (photography, music, etc.) is impeccable. The result is what happened to us: after three years of having lost track of the series (no cable some days, no time other days), we came back to it through our Netflix subscription, and now it's got us hooked again.",1143936000,2,1018,4.745762711864407
2238040,3,B0007R4SWM,"Note--this comes from a perspective of someone who has not yet seen the fourth or fifth seasons.

The first two seasons of ""Six Feet Under""--really drew me in.  The funeral home was always threatened by a conglomerate corporation, Nate and Brenda, both who had really serious issues on their own had a rather interesting relationship to watch, David's coming to turns with his identity, Claire's problems with her relationships and friendships as an outcast in high school, the threat of Billy to many of the characters (Nate, Brenda, Claire) and Ruth's coming to terms with relationships and finding peace (i.e. ""The Plan"")-- all of these were rather interesting, drew us to the characters, and were unique, as well as wild and off the wall.  Add to this and accidental dosages of ecstasy and dream/talk to dead sequences with the Father were rather engaging--along with David or Rico or Nate dealing with the deceased of that week for that struggle they were dealing with at that time and the conversations they had-- a lot of that was good stuff.  The Fisher house would always have this atmosphere of depressing/dysfunctionality, but all of these attachments made it interesting.  We wanted to come into this house, take a seat and spend time with the Fishers.

Then in the third season, a lot of the chemistry went so well, went lost.  I had no problem with the season opening--Actually it added to the dimensions of the show of dealing with death and loved ones and opened up the possibility that maybe Nate made a choice, even if it's how he recalled it--but the time gap had its consequences, since I as a viewer still cannot buy that he married Lisa.  Lisa's role as a regular also seemed difficult to watch--she was the substitute for Brenda, who was gone for half a season, and while I applauded her at a critical point regarding her career in the first three episodes and how she handled it, I otherwise did not care about her.  Add to what happens at the end of this season and that's very critical--because in order for it to work we had to care about her, and clearly see some bond with Nate and her we could totally buy.

As for the other stories--this season seemed to throw in stories then withdrew them.  I mean just as the Kathy Bates character and Ruth showed a lot of interesting things that could've happened with their frienship, the Kathy Bates character LEAVES.  And it's unfortunately not an enigmatic departure say as with say Gabriel's departure in the second season.

Continual non-commitals include some exploratory of existence and death/living worlds and time does not exist of the season opening and then totally dropped (only occasionally referred a bit in the last couple of episdoes of the season) makes this season uneven.

Then the other characters--I did like the Kathy Bates character and the intern.  In fact, the odd infatuation with Ruth and the intern was rather interesting, but then even that seemed to be dropped when suddenly she's with this other character.

Claire is part of a love triangle--which could be actually intriguing if the writers didn't beat us viewers over the head as to what was to come.  Otherwise, this story seemed painfully long and probably didn't warrant an entire season.

David and Kieth, meanwhile, seemed to be rather a domestic partner soap opera at times--especially when David makes a choice I do not totally buy--wanting to engage in a threesome when he was so repelled by it from the first season.  David's exploration of his existence and identity seemed to be terribly diminished--even if he was totally out and in a relationship there should still be issues, and they really weren't explored.  Kieth's character seemed to function as much as Lisa's for Nate--except at least I buy David and Kieth's chemistry.

Finally, Brenda.  Thank goodness Brenda finally came back and we spent some time with her.  While an incident between her and her brother Billy, was too blunt (I think the violence from the first season regarding the tattoo stated things much more clearly.  We didn't need to be reminded, again), I couldn't help but be drawn to her scenes and was especially intrigued by the conflicts set out between her and her mother.

Other bonds worth watching--Nate as a father to Maya (at least until he loses it at the end of the season), Ruth and the Kathy Bates character, Ruth and the intern, Brenda trying to find a bond with someone again and feels she can't find anyone, Rico dealing with a very depressed wife--these transcend the otherwise soap opera quality the third season seemed to turn.  Otherwise, sorry the bar fight Nate engages himself in the last show of the season--over the top, been there, done that.  Didn't find his angst interesting or intriguing to watch.

But as for the atmosphere established in the first two seasons--yes, scenes still fade into the white, and there's the mingling of the dead/dream world and the real--but it didn't seem to be the same show.  Also, this season tries to explore elements of gay culture--I just don't know about the back to back episodes of David and Kieth attending a Leading Lady Party and then Gay Paint Ball-- seemed too cute and seemed to make gay life be a rather artificial construct--which would be fine if these artificial constructs showed some type of revelation of David's and Kieth's characters--but seemed more showy at best.  Perhaps if the series better explored the two characters trying to find a social life that fits--I think that was what was intended for the blueprint for this season--but I just didn't feel I got much from the two characters finally, and I don't think the intention was too clear.  I was left finding David and Kieth ""being boring"" finally more than anything else, and would've rather watched David dealing with a conglomerate or Kieth dealing with finding a job he felt good at to boost his morale, or be more engaging with the family (Kieth finally did deal with his family, but it was written way too late in the season, I think, for all of a sudden he to be doing something).

I really hope the quality goes back in the fourth and fifth seasons.  Where are the concerns of the family or the family business being threatened (often interlocked)?  What happened where the dead person had a serious effect on a character's issue that particular week?  Where is growth/revelations that sometimes cropped up for the characters?  What about the atmosphere of the dead/dream world/imagined with the living and the direct conversations that seemed to be part of the reality-- and if the premiere episode of third season was supposed to add dimensions to it, why was it so rapidly dropped?  I know shows sometimes have to grow and change and not do the same things, but this season it seemed to be too conventional for a series that is not.",1141430400,34,6825,4.78772378516624

2238042,1,B0007R4SWM,"Six Feet Under is a rich meditation on death, and life. It's life, against the eternal (and very present backdrop) of death, finding meaning and richness: Claire's creative and coming-of-age journey, David's quest for love and identity, Nate's struggle with meaning and mortality, Ruth's sense of alienation as an aging widow. It also jolts the audience and characters out of denial of death to look at the value and urgency of getting on with our finite lives.

At least, so it was for two seasons.

The third season begins with a dream-sequence, and it's never quite clear when that ends... it just sort of mushes into an episode, and then a series of episodes, so bad, so flavorless, so without purchase, that I was wondering if the dream sequence had ended at all.

(If not, it's very tedious dream sequence. Speaking of which, those sequences in general, so interesting and amusing at first as they displayed characters thoughts spinning off crazily, have long-since gone stale, mostly because they're poorly thought out and badly realized.)

I wish that the reviews had been more accurate and honest. I wish that every review had been one star. That way, I would've just given up on the series at the end of season two, when it was still good, and figured that unresolved ending was just the way it was meant to be. I would've still loved it. Now, I just find the whole thing grating.

The main thing about season three is that there's just not enough substance. There is, in the entire season, enough for maybe half an episode of season one.

Many said the first season was the best television show ever. Though I watch very little TV (I watched this all on DVD) season one is certainly by far the best show I've ever seen, more like a series of movies than television, and good movies at that.

The second season, though much inferior to the first, was still very good, with exceptional moments.

But the third season... well, it bears very, very little relation to the first two. The audience's interest is retained only by the soap opera aspects. (That  happens with television: Audiences are still intrigued by the characters and the producers, though they're out of ideas, milk it for a while by turning the show into a soap opera.)

It's like the funeral home was indeed taken over by a corporation - seems to be the same establishment, but what's inside is totally different, and lifeless.

The characters are played by the same actors, of course, but even Rachel Griffiths can't do much with scripts that have become boring. Though everyone is still doing their jobs well, it seems like Lauren Ambrose (Claire) is the only other actor putting her heart into it.

The way the deaths were woven into the fabric of the episodes, so crucial to this series, is absent. It's just a business, and they might as well be selling lawnmowers. The scripts could be transferred to or from any other show, and seem to have been.

David's become effeminate and swishy - closer to a stereotype and out of character from who he was in season one - and his romantic travails have become monotonous.

Ruth just seems goofy, and lost. Without that marvelous interplay of her lusty Russian, Nikoli (full of irrepressible life, including the symbolism in his vocation), her world is just comfortingly dull, even when a bit spiced up by a naughty friend (introduced with a lame addiction storyline that seemed to be just introduce the new friend).

Claire's journey, though it's the most interesting thing about the season, and its focus (sort of), has become tedious as well. (Her art-school teacher is just a well-rendered stock character.)

Nate we just can't make ourselves care about anymore. The character he was before had a certain core that this one just doesn't. Maybe it's his brain problem, but he's not him anymore.

Frederico remains little more than a prop, continuously exploited by Fishers. They pay him less than he's worth, treat him terribly no matter how much he does for them, and then, though they left him to twist in the same situation (when they could have easily helped him), he comes through with a lifesaver when they're desperate (for which, with typical ingratitude, they take advantage of him again). It's crazy that anyone would entrust money to people who handle it so badly. Talk about a doormat. It's strange that there's no explanation or exploration of that.

Keith, once so intriguing, has become a prop as well, almost on the level of comic relief. He has a boring job that's boring for us to watch, and they've decided he has to become a boring guy.

It seems like the writers just can't imagine anyone in a mundane job could have an interesting and worthwhile existence, and the show has taken on a mildly racist tinge.

Lisa, originally a one-dimensional, one-off character, should have remained such, or stayed in the background. Her story is dull - it doesn't have to be, but it is - and drags down the rest with it, if it can be dragged lower.

Brenda is only interesting at all because she's so well-acted. The character, like everything else, has gone flat (uh, so to speak). No matter how well acted, the characters have become cardboard cutouts.

The writers also introduce a mildly autistic, slightly creepy nerd. For some reason. (Also very well acted... and pointless.)

I like who the characters were on the first season. For example, I liked Brenda's self-assurance, even though there was all kinds of damage beneath it; that played nicely into Nate's air of detached, rugged cool, just beneath which he was perpetually skating over the very thin ice of an empty and meaningless existence.

People change, but there's something left of who they were, instead of something completely unrelated - David lurching into a stereotype, for example. When he asks the new assistant (in season one) what makes her think he's gay, we might wonder the same thing. In season three, it's so obvious that the only answer is, Duh.

Why?

Why does Nate lose his entire personality and replace it with a new one with no connection or even transition (brain surgery)? Was Keith's entire identity based on being a cop who hadn't shot anyone yet (and why, in that scene, didn't his partner fire as well - who'd want to have a partner that wouldn't do anything when someone swings a gun around to shoot you)?

In short, though called by the same names and played by the same actors, the characters otherwise unrelated to those of season one.

There is no point to watching this season. Though I was soon bored, I kept on because I figured there had to be some payoff somewhere. There isn't.

The first season is stunning. The second, though uneven, is still excellent.

The third, though, looks like some goof took the characters and wrote a weak fan-fiction version.

The technique is still superb: There are marvelous touches, like when a character shocking news there's no ominous theme music or heavy-handed camerawork; it's just an ordinary afternoon. It's just that the writing has fallen apart.

To the injury of wasted time and money, one writer adds insult, literally: Wondering why the second season was inferior to the first, I listened to the writer's commentary on an episode. She starts by insulting the audience for having nothing better to do than listen to her. It's not funny - it doesn't seem to be meant to be funny - and it turns out to be a well-founded, as she has nothing interesting to say.

Might explain why the following season is so crappy. Everything is just plot devices and recycled sitcom gags (e.g., meeting the priest in the video store).

I was curious enough about why this was so bad, when the first season was so good, that I poked around on the Internet a bit. A lot of comments were along the lines of will X and Y get back together? Will A and B break up? Soap opera comments for a soap opera season.

There are people who liked season three; there are people who like soap operas, and this season basically is one (centered around a funeral home).

Read the episode guides. By the second episode of the first series, so much had happened it felt like I'd been watching for at least a season already. And although the second season faltered, with a lot more filler, it still had a great deal to offer.

Had the entire third season been cut down to make up one episode, or maximum two, it might have been good, but as it is, it's all just vague filler, a waste of time and talent.

Anyone who likes Six Feet Under and hasn't yet watched beyond season two would be well advised not to. Just pretend it ended at the end of season two, maybe leaving some things unresolved, but that's just the way it ended. Leave it there and appreciate it for what it was. Unless you're a big fan of fan-fiction, there's no point in watching beyond that.",1134950400,24,8802,4.676813471502591

2238054,3,B0007R4SWM,"I really loved the first 2 seasons but the 3rd season seemed like a whole lot of nothing.

Problems:

David

David is now much more effeminate in his relationship w/ Keith.  The cool thing about David before was that he was still a man and a straight person such as myself could somewhat relate to his life.  This season he is decidedly more of a bitch in his relationship which is a downer for me.

Nate

Whats up with Nate.  He has a car accident w/ Brenda in the last show of last season and now he's married to Lisa?  What happened here, why did they skip all of this.  Being married with a daughter in her first year I can relate to a lot of what Nate is going through but then when Lisa dissappears he decides to go out and start balling chicks and ignoring his daughter?

Not very realistic if you ask me.

Ruth, Claire, and Keith pretty much stayed in character but this show definitely needs Brenda and her family's presence.  Unfortunately they were absent the majority of the season.

When they do surface they waste an entire episode on Brenda's fathers death.  He was such a minor character and it seemed to be a waste of time to me.

Dream sequences

Please learn from the mistakes the Soprano's make.  DO NOT SHOW DREAM SEQUENCES.  I mean what a cheap way to get the audience's attention.  Show something and act like it's real just to have Nate wake up and discover its a dream.

These sequences are a waste of time and need to go.

Last beef: Lisa's death

I hope it's not too much of a spoiler to say this but in Season 3, Nate's new wife Lisa disappears for several episodes.  All were told in the season finale is that she is dead, not if she killed herself, was murdered, or died of an accident.  Just that she's dead.  What a horrible ending to the season.  It's one thing to have a cliffhanger between seasons, but to just say that Lisa's dead with no information was a cheap way to end the season.

A star or 2 below the first 2 seasons but I will still watch Season 4.

In case SFU fans didn't know it, the show was almost cancelled after this year so this should be a good wake up call to the writers.",1128297600,9,2127,4.221393034825871

2238058,5,B0007R4SWM,"I must say (and it looks like I'm pretty much alone in this opinion) that I was not completely impressed with Season 2. For me, after watching the glorious season 1 which had such heart and set the bar so high, I expected season two to be amazing. But sadly I was very much let down. Season 2 faultered as most season twos do because it was just more of the same but a bit more exagerrated version of season one. So after finishing it I was a little fearful of season three. But when I began to watch 3 I noticed that it was very much like 1 in a creative sense. The plots and characterizations were back to basics and the ""obsession with sex"" (aside from Oliver's) was left at the door. Six Feet Under was never about sex, but that was all season two seemed to care about, almost in a ""Queer as Folk"" sort of way. Sex was used due to lack of great stories but watching season 3 I think the writers have realized this because all the characters are so drastically different. Brenda has always been my least favorite character but in season three I found the change in her quite refreshing. She now wants to live her life now and it was good to see. Is it better than Season 1? Well, I don't know if any season will ever be as fantastic as the first but i have to say it came close.

2238060,5,B0007R4SWM,"OK, several weeks have passed since I first viewed (Season One) Six Feet Under. Having become inadvertently hooked on it meanwhile, Season Three is absolutely the best so far. The 'Snidely Whiplash' character of Brenda, along with her ""relationship"" with Nate, had become really grating after two seasons, and I'm grateful for the time out.

In this series of episodes, the major players thaw out a bit. David becomes less uptight, Ruth less of a control freak, Claire  sometimes forgets to display her deer-caught-in-the-headlights / how-did-the-stork-drop-me-off-with-THIS-family look, and the  Nate post-surgery (sans Brenda) is kinder, gentler.

Yet after every episode we are left curious about such changes, be they subtle or monumental, as well as wondering if and when this, too, shall pass. And I suppose therein lies the secret in capturing and captivating us, the unsuspecting viewers.

But never mind the plot twists; the acting is primo, and I'm picking up a lot more humor too. I honestly don't know how it happened, but ""Six Feet Under"" is a TV series which doesn't seem like one. In other words, I don't feel as though watching it is a complete waste of time. That may not sound like much of a compliment, but coming from me (a radical Anti-Couch Potato), it is the highest praise. I've even graduated from scrambling back & forth from the public library, to signing up with 'Netflix' on account of it.

The other seasons that I've seen are just more intensive in relation to the show's resplendent realism and irreverent discourse on American culture.  I'd like to think of Season 3 as a meditation on the subtleties and intricacies of relationships albeit strained, and as a transitional period for the characters.

The show's producers immediately establish the ephemerality of the season in the first 3 episodes with Nate, Ruth and eventually Brenda, especially.  Almost all the characters have this unspoken anxiety and so we as viewers feel this strain as well, like we are waiting for something, just as the characters on the show.  This is probably why viewers have some reservations of this season.  But because I know it is all purposive, I can truly see the genius behind it and the writers' intentions.

The first eight or so episodes are quiet Taoist-like commentaries on just that, then the pace starts to quicken after some very tragic and dramatic events that affect the entire cast (all of which have really grown into their roles to convey a staunch realism that I have never-before-seen in actors).

And the writers and producers write this way on purpose.  This season is as subtle and quiet as a cool zephyr and just as refreshing.  Yet the last 4 episodes really climb in dramatic intensity, leaving our edge-of-the-seat suspense to be quenched come Season 4.

Tough, no- holds- barred writing, beautifully executed by people who act as if this might be the last great thing they do. A gift to us out here in the imaginary world.....watch it and weep.",1118448000,,431,4.468354430379747

I plugged in the third DVD and the only thing preventing me from watching to the very end of the season was sheer exhaustion. Compelling human drama. And with some humour. And to my own surprise tears burned in my eyes in a few scenes. The show really hit stride in this the third and best so far season; and I haven't seen anything later than the third. You won't go wrong if you are looking for good drama, with some humour.",1118188800,,546,4.160377358490566

We only have to pay NZ$74.00 per series at home - which is about US$50 - and that isn't the discounted rate either! They are all such fantastic series' - so why are they so expensive??

2238073,5,B0007R4SWM,"Season 3 was a yawner for the most part. Sometimes I was unable to discern reality from ""dream sequences"" in the plot. I know I saw every episode in season 3, but I'll be darned if I could remember many of the scenes I saw on a marathon weekend of seeing the boxed set. That tells me much about season 3, and want it did and did not do for me personally. Certainly, SFU is dysfunction personified, the family dynamics, each character in his/her own right, and the funeral industry all played havoc with our minds as we the viewers attempted to make logic from the illogical and function from the dysfunctional. Having had a close relationship with the funeral industry for a number of years, I might be able to hold my own with terminology, fact, and fiction ""laid to rest"" on our shoulders by the writers of SFU. They've done a fine job of keeping things ""real.""  I cannot agree with my ""neighbor"" W. Brown in Frisco (Dallas) Texas about his view of season 3. Though it was, many times, much like the daytime soaps, it still held a ring of truth.

My gripe is with HBO for taking longer to produce the boxed CD set than the season lasted. I am pleasantly astonished that they have already set a release date for season 4, as season 5 begins June 6. Bravo for HBO for finally catching up with original series on other satellite/cable networks.

I, like Mr./Ms. Brown only subscribe to HBO for SFU. I hope he/she and others will give the show another chance. Season 5 cannot be worse than season 3. Since I've found I'd been comatose throughout season 3, I'm about to launch into season 5 to see what happens as Nate and Brenda come back together as they hopefully should. David and Keith haven't a snowballs chance in Hades of ever being happy, and so long as Ruth continues her bi-polar existence, she'll be as happy as she will ever be as a single over-intrusive mother. The character Clair is so beyond any description, I'll just remain mute on what happens to her. Nothing will surprise me including the possibility of her painting the green hearse black or purple to match her dark persona. Has anyone seen her happy unless the happiness was chemically induced?

To bring these ramblings to a conclusion is as impossible as bringing SFU to a conclusion. Perhaps I give myself too much credit for I cannot hold a candle to the writers and characters of SFU. I've loved every minute of SFU, even the ones I cannot remember. I will see them again on the boxed sets however, and think ""How did I forget that?""

The show has to end, although I am sad to know that this is the finale season. I see no resolution to any of the dysfunction, so we'll have to live with it just as the characters will. Is that not the reason we ""love"" SFU so much? We love the dysfunction, albeit, no matter how soapish it becomes, it will never approach the dysfunction of the daily soaps where script no longer matters so long as enough flesh is shown to keep the viewer titillated.

Since the series began with the death of one who would likely have been a major character (and was as a ghost), I wonder if the series will end as it began. Who will be the one to go ""Six Feet Under"" in the last episode?",1117238400,2,3184,4.397283531409168

8050824,1,B0007R4SWM,"Seasons 1-2 get a full 5 stars. They're sad, funny, and clever.
Season 3 gets a -5 stars, the ""Lisa Season."" The ""Joe Lies, Joe Lies, When He Cries"" actress from Say Anything. REALLY, no one cares about this character.
Seasons 4-5 gets 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor. You end up disliking main characters.
Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.

For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.

Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with George. Baffling.

Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? Keith owns an armored car (his name's on it) and is making a delivery to the First Back of India. Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so do we assume he closed the business and moved out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind? So the big love story is just a bust after all? 14 years later David keels over just before seeing Keith again? Huh?

Our group applauds the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though. Everyone watching this episode was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?

By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this. Love the pic on the wall of the old David and the young Keith...uh...that makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Miya? Guess she lived forever?

If you have NOTHING else to do, watch the first 2 seasons, enjoy them while they were good, and then move onto something else. Season 3 was a total throw away (NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE LISA CHARACTER) and 4-5 are just slow and depressing. And the abrupt unoriginal lazy ending is an insult, both to the characters and the viewer.",1519084800,,2689,4.708510638297873
