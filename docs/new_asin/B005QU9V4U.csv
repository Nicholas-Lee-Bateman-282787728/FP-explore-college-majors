8483746,4,B005QU9V4U,"First off, it's a good DVD.  Unfortunately, this band is no longer active.  My only complaint is that it is in PAL format.  No where on Amazon's site or the DVD case or disc does it state this.  The disc is playable on a computer but not on standard North American DVD players.  The only way I found out is through Apple's DVD Player software, more info.

Again, good quality video.  You just need a multi format DVD player or watch it on your PC.",1398038400,,447,4.188235294117647
