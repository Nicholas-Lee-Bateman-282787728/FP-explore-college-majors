4009098,2,B002XKKX7K,"This was a truly inspirational series for both for Navy veterans and the military community.  Season 10 undermined the whole series.

Once John Jackson (Admiral Chegwidden) left the series, the fabric of the storyline disappeared.  Those who want completeness in their series collections should purchase this season.  Those who love JAG, should skip it.

The new ""General JAG"" is an absolute waste of time as are the raft of ""new"" characters which (seemingly) ALL miss the mark in terms of the continuity of the series.

The true legacy of JAG should be a movie which sees the progression of characters including David Elliott as RADM & JAG Harmon Rabb Jr. who closes many storylines left in JAG.  It should also include John M. Jackson as the CNO (Chief of Naval Operations) who should be a principal in the movie.

Donald Bellisario should be ashamed of this Season 10 effort.",1264118400,7,878,4.845637583892618
4009099,5,B002XKKX7K,"I have all the seasons of this good show. All of the seasons were really good. If you want good court room drama and military drama, these are the DVDs to buy.",1262044800,3,159,4.0
4009100,2,B002XKKX7K,"Season 10 of this once great show introduced too many new characters; most of them not very likeable especially the Vulvovick one. I agree that after being a devoted fan of this show for 10 years, myself and all of the other fans deserved a better finale of the long awaited romance of Harm and Mac. Instead, the final episode was dominated by the hateful new Lt. Vulcovick. Only the final seven and a half minutes of the show saw the two main characters come together.",1261958400,42,469,4.465116279069767
4009101,5,B002XKKX7K,"I really liked watching the show from day one, yeah they show it once in a while on certain channels but if you get the dvds you don't get the commercials that come with it, Yeah some shows are not so great after a certain amount of seasons but this show was living up to every word and action. I really liked the fact that the two main characters were still in all of the seasons, to me its fun to look back at tv shows you really liked like this show and see what you missed come pared to these shows these days, So if you are looking for a good show to sit down with the family this is the show, if anyone who is serving for this country i think you must own this season as well as the other seasons, But yet again i was sad to see it go and also was a bit shocked at the ending.
Boo they  end things like this
enjoy
we need hart to hart to come out
all i can say is that i am glad this is NOT coming out On Blue Ray",1261958400,14,919,3.712820512820513
4009102,4,B002XKKX7K,"After 9 well-recieved seasons, the 10th and final season of JAG may seem like a drag to some, unwatchable to others, or a low-quality version of the show we all knew and loved.  In my opinion, the fault of these 22 episodes lies not in the actor's ability to portray their characters, but rather in the fact that Admiral Chegwidden had retired and were introduced to too many new characters over the course of the season.

This had been nothing new to JAG.  Sturgis Turner came in Season 7, Petty Officer Coates was added a year or two later as a main character.  Even Bud & Harriet came in seasons 2 & 3.  However, in Season 10, we are introduced to a new admiral, a couple new lawyers (one namely a Lt. Gregory Vukovic, who Rabb--and many fans--did't like), and so we are forced to watch new actors ""create"" their characters in the final season of an established show. Obviously, Donald P. Bellisario wanted to keep his succesful show on the air longer (especially since David James Elliott had officially stated this season would be his last).  Maybe he tried too hard.

At any rate, JAG does deliver a few more entertaining episodes, and finally ends the tension between Harm & Mac in the last episode.  And although one couldn't give season 10 an A+, the show still manages to pull off a few suprises till the end.

The following is a list of the final 22 episodes:

1. Hail and Farewell, Part II (2)
2. Corporate Raiders
3. Retrial
4. Whole New Ball Game
5. This Just In from Baghdad
6. One Big Boat
7. Camp Delta
8. There Goes the Neighborhood
9. The Man on the Bridge
10. The Four Percent Solution
11. Automatic for the People
12. The Sixth Juror
13. Heart of Darkness
14. Fit for Duty
15. Bridging the Gulf
16. Straits of Malacca
17. JAG: San Diego
18. Death at the Mosque
19. Two Towns
20. Unknown Soldier
21. Dream Team
22. Fair Winds and Following Seas

So, while Season 10 may not the it's best, for all you JAG fans and buffs, you should add it to your collection.  It is still fun and entertaining.  Get ready for JAG's final tour of duty.",1259798400,108,2054,4.373684210526315
4009103,3,B002XKKX7K,"Season 9 was bad but Season 10 brought about the deterioration of what had been a great show and one that I never missed watching.  The new characters were awful, expecially the Vic character who was just disgusting.  The new General was a poor judge of character who though Vic was great.  Resurrection of Webb from the dead again was just to much and the unreal story arc of Mattie was over the top.  Webb should have been left dead this time and Mattie left with her father never to be heard from again.  D.Bellisario always said he would wait until the show ended to bring Harm and Mac together and he wasn't kidding but only allowing 7 1/2 minutes at the end was a diservice to the loyal fans that had watched all of those years.  He even had to ruin the final episode by having the replusive Vic monopolize half of the episode.

CBS moved the show to the Friday night graveyard in Season 9 and then complained about not having the young demographic that are not home watching TV on Friday night.
I have pre-ordered this only to have the complete 10 year set.  I have my doubts I will even open the package.  There are only about 3 or 4 episodes worth watching more than once.",1259798400,8,1181,4.331818181818182

I enjoyed it and it was definitely worth watching, but I would have loved to have seen JAG continued with Mac and characters on the west coast and Harm in some civilian law-firm and taking care of Maddie.  On another note, I would have loved to see the Admiral show up in the bar for Harm and Mac's announcement.  Missed him and he belonged in among those who served under his command.",1471737600,,497,4.428571428571429

Jackson as Admiral Chegwidden and Karri Turner as Harriet Sims, the series loses a lot of its luster.  However, there are still some very good episodes in the final season.  If you've watched all the previous seasons and hoping to find out what happens with Rabb and Mac, you'll have to make up your own conclusions because the writers leave the audience hanging.

4009204,5,B002XKKX7K,"The final season of Jag. A change in cast was okay, but overall I think they could have ended the series with the retirement of the Admiral. The new cast members aren't bad, they just feel forced on the show.

Also the last episode really drags out with flashbacks, they could have instead used that time to really complete the ending and how the characters stories and lives would go on. The final season was a nice fit for the show, but again, a more complete ending with a more concrete resolution would have been better. But as far as endings for shows go, if wasn't horrible, and I think JAG fans will still be pleased.",1424304000,,624,4.379310344827586

4009258,3,B002XKKX7K,"This series has been a very personal one for me. My late Dad, retired from the RCN (Royal Canadian Navy) and I would watch it together or when he was not visiting he would watch it at home and we would talk about it. It helped me get to know a bit more about him and his own naval career. My late son and I watched it together too, and would discuss it.

Online (the old tvtome site, sold to tv.com now) I met a group of people who would discuss each and every episode of the series starting, for me, from season 6. Today I am still in touch with a number of those folk - they became friends.

This season 10 was a big disappointment in the decisions that were made. They brought in Vukovic (Vic) who was supposedly to be a new love interest for Mac. This did NOT go over well with the fans! Harm's presence was sporadic which was not supposed to happen to the main character. One episode I think he was on for less than 5 minutes! And Admiral AJ was sorely missed. Cresswell replaced him and while he was okay, one season did not give the fans an opportunity to warm up to him. I felt bad for those 2 actors who were added like that. Word has it that Bellisario was seldom on the set the last two years, expending all his time and energy on his new series, NCIS and that is when the fans noticed changes in both season 9 and then season 10. Even the traditional visit of Harm to the Wall at Christmas was missing. Instead we had Mac in the hospital.

Don't get me wrong - some of the story lines were great. It was good to see the story of Mattie continue and see the new members of Bud & Harriet's family. Some of the cases were good - Vic resolving the issue of the too young sailor for example. But the over all ""feel"" was gone. The whole atmosphere seemed tense and angry. Missing was the camaraderie and humour we were use to.

The finale was a huge disappointment. Yeah yeah - I know, Harm & Mac were engaged. But all this was a last minute re-write. There was no real courtship and no wedding. This was, after all, a 9 year build up to be resolved in less than 42 minutes (remembering there were other story lines going on so it was a much less than 42 minute courtship). We didn't get to see Bud's reaction to the news of the engagement, nor anyone elses. That would have been at least a 5 minute story line there!

We all wished for a movie to answer all the unanswered questions and to maybe change things from the final episode (Maybe start the movie with most of seasons 9 & 10 being a dream sequence for Harm akin to that of Bobby in Dallas....) We feel that we were not given a proper ending. We feel like we've been robbed.",1388966400,5,2639,4.116504854368932

4009260,5,B002XKKX7K,"One of the most infuriating aspects of DVDs is when the making of them doesn't let you skip the opening and go to the start of the episode.  You only need to see so many of the opening name and scenes that repeated each week of the series, when watching episode after episode.  Additionally, they have an all play, so you don't have to go back to the menu each time,scroll down the list to the next episode in sequence and select it - you can watch one, it ends, the beginning comes on, you hit skip and into the next episode you are - delightful.

4009264,5,B002XKKX7K,"O.K. Yes, the last year was sub-par. Most  of the critical comments you read are true. Adm. ""C"" being gone was almost fatal to the show because the show revolved a lot around him...of course, the Harm and Sarah characters were the the main attraction. Still this is one of my all time faves on tv. We deserved to see a romance evolve between Harm and Sarah. We deserved to see them walk under the swords of their fellow officers...heck, they did it for Bud and Harriet (season 4, me thinks.) We should have seen him as a Captain at the beginning of season 10.

We deserve a reunion movie with him as a two star in charge of Jag and Sarah as a U.S. Senator, with a Rabb, Jr.

But to end whether he becomes a Captain or her a General and do they get married...ended with a coin toss... we wuz robbed Bubba, jus' plain out robbed.

4009278,5,B002XKKX7K,"While I was in the Air Force I served as a military police officer, paralegal, and administrator.  I am extremely familiar with the military justice system.  I once had to testify, as a Staff Sergeant, in a military court-marital of an airman for assaulting me, showing disrespect for my unit's commanding officer, and for being AWOL.  I was treated just like any other witness for the prosecution on the show JAG.  The accused defense counsel took my police statement and went word for word in every sentence to trip me up bue he failed to do because I lived it and knew what happened that fateful day in the summer of 1973.  All I did on the witness stand was tell the truth about what happened.  I was on the witness stand for over an hour with him trying to bate me.  Yes, I did sleep well with my testimony.

Some of my friends and others have called this show ""The Catherine Bell Show.""  That title would have been very appropriate because she is so lovely, a great actress, and portrayed her role as a Lt. Col Marine JAG officer in an outstanding manner.

I have written two books and in both books I have addressed the military justice system regarding themilitary death penalty and sex crimes in the military.

I truly hated seeing the show to end.  I have purchased the entire series and review it often.  Also, I have seen and recorded a few of the later Perry Mason series from the 1980s through the 1990s.

I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys courtroom drama and miitary operations.

attempt at a failed pilot).

4009292,4,B002XKKX7K,"""JAG"" was a consistently good show for most of its ten seasons, with an entertaining mixture of exciting courtroom drama, exotic adventures in and out of uniform, ward room comedy, and character romances.  If the plots were often a little (or a lot) far-fetched, the cast usually pulled it off in fine form, while the tone of the show was consistently respectful of military traditions.  ""JAG"" got a new lease on life after 9/11 opened up a whole new range of possibilities for stories.

One of the consistent themes of the show was the intriguing relationship between series lead Harmon ""Harm"" Raab (David James Elliot), Navy JAG lawyer and aviator, and his Marine Corp counterpart, the fiesty and independent Sarah ""Mac"" McKenzie (Catherine Bell).  Harm and Mac were great partners on many an adventure in and out of the courtroom, and constantly on the verge of admitting to their deeper feelings for each other.  Loyal viewers waited patiently for the two to finally come together, and there were clear signs in seasons eight and nine that aviator playboy Harm had finally matured, while Sarah appeared ready for a stable relationship.

All this brings us to Season Ten.  David James Elliot was on his way out of the series, and the producers sidelined his character for much of the season in favor of laying the groundwork for a reboot that would have taken Mac McKenzie to San Diego to manage a new crop of young JAG lawyers.  Prominent among the new characters was the obnoxious LT Gregory Vukovic (Chris Beetam), who tried to cut corners in the courtroom while chasing Lt Col McKenzie in a most unprofessional manner.  A new senior JAG officer changed the ward room environment at JAG headquarters, while many series mainstays were eased out the door.  This reviewer was disappointed in many of the episodes, a feeling only partially assuaged by the season and series finale, which featured Harm and Mac in a life-changing cliffhanger dilemma.

If you were a long-time fan of JAG, or if you picked up the series in rerun on cable, you have to watch the final season to see how it all plays out.  ""JAG: Season Ten"" is recommended to its fans.",1335657600,,2149,4.778378378378378

I own 8 of the JAG seasons, and I love the show. It is sad that the standards of the show fell so horrifically the last season. The man who replaced Jackson's Chegwidden simply lacks Jackson's strong actor's personality (THIS man was in Band of Brothers as the man who turned Dick Winters transfer to Japan down, and he was fine in that, but here, he seems lackluster.). The show always had immense humor, some of which was at its best during the Mic Brumby shows. Little of that here in episodes. Little money was spent on soundtrack (witness the weak music track for the last two shows ever made here) and less money spent on sets. The room where Mac and Harm learn, in the 2nd to last episode, of their transfers to San Diego and London looks like four, colorless stage flats thrown together, with pale paint. Period. Contrast that with the luxurious conference rooms Chegwidden always had during his years. It as though the producers knew the show was ending, so why bother putting money into a quality product anymore? The actors are not to blame for any of that. Content wise, the pre-Christmas show where Mac has her car accident, after talking to a psychiatrist, largely about Harm, is very fine--acting, direction, plot.  Other episodes are lacking. And I'm sorry, but anything with Vukovic or whatever young kid's name was, was beyond dull and boring. HE couldn't act, as far as I was concerned. Contrast the final episode, with Mac's engagement episode in season 6 or 7, where Chegwidden hosted the party for her and Brumby (David James Elliot directed, and the episode was called Lifeline maybe?), and you'll see the immense drop in quality.

However, life got in the way and I had missed Season 10 so I finally watched it.....now I see why most fans were let down.  If you're a JAG fan and completist, you will want this season for its conclusion and to complete your collection.  If you're a casual fan, don't bother.  Although General Cresswell (David Andrews) was a likeable character, he was no Adm. Chegwidden.  Too many new characters were introduced and the most annoying of those was Lt. ""Vic"" Vulkovic.  Brought in by Bellisario to replace Rabb, Vulkovic was a one-dimensional joke of a role which required nothing more than the actor pouting like Zoolander ""Blue Steel"" style.  He was also hitting on every female in the JAG office including PO Coates.  This character's behavior wouldn't be tolerated for one second in today's military.  Bellisario should've just paid extra to keep David James Elliot.  As stated earlier, his multifaceted portrayal of Harmon Rabb was the heart and soul of the show.  Throw in the blatant attempt to make a newer and ""hipper"" JAG (see the JAG: San Diego episode) to grab the youth demographic, making Mac act more like Mariska Hargitay on SVU, stories that echoed the media's growing criticism of the military, and reducing the resolution of the Harm/Mac story to the last seven minutes of the finale.  The result is a marginally satisfying but ultimately disappointing conclusion to an amazing show which portrayed the military in a positive light.

Buy this season if you need to complete your collection and if you're a die-hard JAG fan.  You WILL get resolution of the story but maybe not closure.  Hopefully, Mr. Elliot can one day be persuaded to reprise his role in a JAG TV movie as Rabb is poised for great things at the end of the show.",1282262400,8,1825,4.731012658227848

4009312,5,B002XKKX7K,"Its amazing how much a show can change so much in its last season, and although I was sad that John M. Jackson leave, David Andrews character of Major General Gordon Cresswell breathed new life into the show. Scott Lawrence, Commander Sturgis Turner, became a regular this season, although he had appeared in Seasons 7, 8 and 9 as a recurring character, as Did Zoe McLellan, who also became a regular, playing her character of Petty Officer Jen Coates. The Season finale came as shock, it was mainly a Vukovic (Chris Beetem) centric episode, but those last 8 minutes were the best moments of JAG you will ever watch, in the final episode Harm is re-assigned to be Force Judge Advocate, London, making him a Captain, while Colonel MacKenzie is reassigned to head up Joint Chiefs in San Diego. Bud, Harriet, Sturgis and Cresswell stay put in Virginia, while Coates transfers to San Diego along with MacKenzie and some other minor characters.

This season was not JAG at its strongest, but with the very moving finale and all the heart-pounding episodes that came before it, JAG 'THE FINAL SEASON' is a must-own DVD.

There were som good episodes, there were some really good episodes and there were one or two excellent episodes and that's fair enough for me. Some have stated that they felt cheated by the final episode, that it could have been so much more. Sure, it could, but I am perfectly satisfied with what we got.

4009338,3,B002XKKX7K,"JAG was my 2nd favorite show debuting in the 1990s. (Babylon 5 was my favorite of that decade.)  I watched JAG its first season when it was stupidly cancelled by NBC until its 10th. season (after CBS picked it up and it became a massive hit, evn begating a bigger hit: NCIS.)  Of all its seasons, the 10th and final was its weakest.  There were two major reasons for this.
Firstly, JAG's star David James Elliott demanded more money when his contract expired.  When it was not given to him, he signed a contract with ABC for a new comedy pilot (which never sold.)  As a result of this, the producers of JAG began phasing his character out.  There were many episodes where he only made a brief appearance.  Big mistake, as his character Harmon Rabb Jr. was the heart and soul of the show.  Secondly, they brought in a new annoying stud, Lt. Vukovich, to replace him.  Bigger mistake, especially when they stupidly had him put the moves on Colonel MacKenzie.  This was doubly idiotic  and in sort of bad taste since everyone who watched the show was well aware that Harm and Mac were madly in love with each other.
The other problem was that JAG was ""played out"" as my father used to say.  The scripts just weren't all that good anymore.  This happens to many series that are on for a very long time.  I loved ""Hawaii 5-0"" and saw every episode during its 12 year run.  However by the 10th year, 5-0 had simply run out of good scripts.  Even a change in supporting cast its final season couldn't hide the fact that the scripts were not what they once were.  Same with Mission:Impossible which ran 7 years.  I thought they simply ran out of interesting missions by the end of its 5th season.
The phasing out of its star, the loss of John Jackson as the beloved boss Admiral Chigwidden who left at the end of the previous season and a lack of really good scripts resulted in a mediocre final season

Stll the last episode was fine with Harm and Mac finally getting together.  (I never got why David James Elliott has not done more since JAG's cancellation 5 years ago.  He co-starred in the second and final season of an excellent series ""Close to Home"" on CBS and did some silly mini-series, I believe, on the Sci Fi. channel.  He is an excellent ""leading man"" and I'm surprised he never tried to make it on the big screen.)
Anyway, JAG was a truly excellent series and I miss it.  Since it has been off for 5 years, I think its time for CBS (or one of the other networks) to start producing some ""Return to JAG"" 2 hour tv movies the way they have done over the years with ""Rockford Files,"" ""Perry Mason,"" ""Gunsmoke"" and many other classic series.  Are you listening guys?",1266364800,26,2669,4.389002036659877
4009339,4,B002XKKX7K,"It wasn't until the complete season DVD sets started rolling around that I got into JAG, I mean, really got into it. And I'm sure other folks are now going thru painful JAG withdrawal, same as me, now that the final season is available on DVD, and there ain't no more after this. It's been a wait and a half for this tenth season to come out on disc, and never mind that these aren't exactly the best episodes in the series. There are enough terrific moments here to still make it a satisfying capper. And, finally, there's a resolution to that long unresolved thing between Mac & Harm. But more on that in a bit.

The cases the JAG officers work on remain as topical and relevant as ever. The courtroom battles revolve around issues such as combat stress, combat high, ageism, improper psychiatric counseling, communication breakdowns in the chain of command, private contractors getting in a firefight with U.S. troops, equal rights (a female sergeant - played by professional boxer Lucia Rijker - wants to fight men in the ring), how far can you take torture to garner information, etc. For me, though, the cases are secondary to what's going on in the cast's personal lives. Bud and Petty Officer Coates are old favorites, and they're featured in several episodes. Bud, as calm and non-threatening a guy as you'll ever meet, is ordered to attend anger management classes, and that notion alone is enough to elicit a grin, if you know your Lieutenant Roberts. Later he goes up against the ""Dream Team"" of Commander Rabb and Lt. Vukovic in court, and manages to get the better of them. Since Vukovic happens to be the lead counsel of that team and an arrogant pup who likes to cut corners, this goes down very gratifyingly. This isn't A FEW GOOD MEN, and Vukovic isn't Tom Cruise.

Meanwhile, Jennifer Coates, reformed thief turned indispensable yeoman to the JAG corps, is a compelling character, and I perk up whenever she's on the screen and quietly running things (doesn't hurt that she's cute, too). ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" finds Coates's past haunting her, forcing her to step out of military protocol and call on her hard-knock experiences in the streets. In ""The Sixth Juror"" Coates gets drafted as a juror on the very same case with which she'd been assisting Harm and Mac. Meanwhile, Mattie's father is more in the picture than ever and he's seeking custody of Mattie, which leaves Harm more or less out in the cold. But then something happens...

""JAG: San Diego"" is another interesting episode, especially since it gives us another chance to see the enthusiastic mystery buff Lt. Graves (we first meet her in ""Automatic for the People""). This episode was intended to pave the way for a possible spin-off, except that CBS chose not to roll the dice.

With David James Elliott opting to leave the show - I think he got tired of waiting for JAG to get its eleventh season pick-up - new characters were introduced. Rear Admiral Chegwidden having retired, the headquarters up in Falls Church, Virginia come rife with rumors regarding the identity of the new Judge Advocate General. The no-nonsense, don't-eff-with-me marine who ends up in the JAG chair doesn't exactly fill Commander Rabb and Colonel MacKenzie with optimism. But, bar none, the most annoying new character is Lt. ""Vic"" Vukovic, who I guess is supposed to be this charming rogue, except he comes off as weasely and really unlikable. Plenty of times, I felt myself wanting to skip over scenes involving him and, to be honest, he kinda soured me on some of the episodes. Especially since he was taking away from more time with the rest of the cast.

Now I do resent that the writers strung out the audience for so long with the whole Mac & Harm ""Will they, why won't they?"" soap opera. Nine years is an exhaustive wait just for the final episode's almost perfunctory resolution, although I suppose it's better than nothing. Still, those final fifteen minutes are not nearly enough, not by far, and I do feel cheated. At least ""The Four Percent Solution"" aired a few months before that, and featured Mac's flashing back to a day spent with her shrink as they explore her very big emotional and psychological baggage. And, yes, one of the issues she's been working thru concerns Harm. Mac and Harm have been so good at internalizing their feelings that something like ""The Four Percent Solution"" is necessary, letting us know that the writers haven't forgotten one of the key elements in the show which drew in the viewers week after week.

And, yes, the special feature isn't that special and, with its brevity, is barely a feature, although the sentiment passed on by David James Elliott and the cast and crew is appreciated. But, again, I feel cheated by the lack of more bonus features. Despite this and the inclusion of the shady Lt. Vukovic and also that Harm and Mac's romance is given short shrift, I'm still rating this 4 stars out of 5. Ultimately, I still love this show, great comfort television that it was.

My guess, by the way, is that it's Harm who ended up retiring...",1266364800,15,5063,4.720588235294118
4009340,5,B002XKKX7K,"This FINAL season was not the best. I have to admit life got in the way and I did not watch this entire season when it aired. However, I did watch the FINALE and after waiting over 9 years for Harm and Mac to finally admit their feelings I was very dissappointed in the amount of time spent on their storyline. The new characters were substandard.  AJ's absence left a great void and the general really did not fit in, too stoic ( I know he was a Marine).  The average length for a TV series is about 10 seasons. If we consider the series was moved at the end of season 1 to another network JAG did well.",1266278400,2,604,4.067226890756302
4009341,3,B002XKKX7K,"I am purchasing this season because there were a few good epsisodes and I want to have the complete set. This was a very disappointing end to a wonderful TV show.  Donald Bellisario had informed David James Elliott that his contract would not be renewed  (Elliott did not quit as was mentioned in another review).  The Vukovic character was supposed to be a new lead to carry the show forward into future seasons, but most fans hated his character.

The one thing that I think was unforgiveable was not to focus the entire last episode on the Harm and Mac story.  At that point, they knew the show was canceled so why did we need to have so much time taken up with the secondary plot with Vukovic.

It has also been very disapointing that there have been so few extras (if any) on the JAG DVD's.  This show deserved much better.",1265760000,8,828,4.407894736842105
