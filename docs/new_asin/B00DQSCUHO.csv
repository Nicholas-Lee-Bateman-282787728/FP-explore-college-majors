5847966,4,B00DQSCUHO,"Jack Black is a force of nature. His larger-than-life personality and musical parody made ""School of Rock"" (2003), with Joan Cusack and Sarah Silverman, a hilarious comedy and one of my favorite movies, while the ensemble cast he joined in ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), which included Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise, created a side-splitting romp that skewered Hollywood. Alas, Black's off-beat ""Nacho Libre"" (2006), a sincerely affectionate homage to the world of Mexican professional wrestling, fell flat for me as it was only periodically amusing. Nevertheless, this compact three-disc box would be a good value even if it only contained the first two films, so just consider the third a bonus. The set features excellent picture and sound together with all of the same special features found on the individual Blu-ray releases.",1396483200,4,871,5.364963503649635

Feel free to pass Nacho Libre on to a friend with bad taste, and enjoy two very fun movies with one of my favorite actors.",1432512000,,258,4.078431372549019
