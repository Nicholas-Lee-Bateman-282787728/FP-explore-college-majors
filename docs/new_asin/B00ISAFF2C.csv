6290645,5,B00ISAFF2C,Jack Nicholson is at his best as a werewolf!,1430524800,,44,4.0
6290646,3,B00ISAFF2C,"This dvd is promoted on its front cover as the ""20th Anniversary Series"" which may lead a purchaser to believe that they are buying a dvd packed with bonus content related to the 20th anniversary of the film, such as a ""making-of"" featurette documentary or retrospective interviews with the cast, producers, or director.

This is so not the case so beware if that is what you are looking for. Not only are such extras not a part of this dvd, but even bonus features which some viewers may consider ""standard"" on a dvd, such as in-film audio commentary, are not included. Very disappointing.

Bottom line: this ""20th Anniversary Series"" of Wolf is bare bones, the dvd contains the film, not a single thing more. It's a great movie in my opinion but it should not have an eye grabbing label implying it is a special edition when it is merely a glorified standard re-release.",1426809600,5,872,4.6558441558441555
6290647,5,B00ISAFF2C,"Sophisticated entry in the Mike Nichols canon features intriguing performances by James Spader, Michelle Pfeiffer, and especially Jack Nicholson, who oddly enough stays fairly tight in the role of a New England-based book editor who happens to have a ""Misery""-style accident on his way home one night and ends up hitting a wolf. But not just any wolf--this one has issues. Issues that he longs to give to someone else. And Nicholson is the candidate. The rest that unfolds reveals nothing significantly new added to the werewolf genre, save for the fact that these wolves are actually wolves and not, ultimately, human/werewolf hybrids which is what horror genre fans are used to. But Nichols's film is not horror but instead a dramatic mystery tale, and as such it is blazingly effective (and yes, the film is humorous at times too). The period in the early 90's (which featured films like ""The Age of Innocence"", ""Batman Returns,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" among others) featured really entertaining movies that tended to play around with the confines of genre; while this film toys with some of the established mythology of traditional werewolf lore, the most significant change is that lycanthropy (as depicted herein) is no longer treated as something tragic but rather as something to be desired--something akin to a gift (though Nicholson says one character would rather be ""damned"" than to die, it is clear what the message is when this character asks Nicholson to help give him immortality anyway). If you feel you are getting into ""Twilight"" territory with this movie, let me correct you now by saying that this is not a juvenile film that aims to have pointless characters running around doing supernatural things when they should be focused upon character and story--""Wolf"" is really a carefully composed drama that happens to contain some werewolf myth in its story.
When literary and film critic Leonard Wolf wrote of the Coppola Dracula film from 1992, he mentioned that the film really proved how secular (in a cultural sense) that present day mythology had become, and in many ways, the mature, subdued, and wisely inconsistent ""Wolf"" goes in a very similar direction, proving that you don't need a belief in the supernatural in order to enjoy a great werewolf tale. And this, I think, is what troubled Leonard Wolf--there is a lack of piousness and quixotic reverence for things supernatural in a world that has lost a need to tell stories that are fantastic (""Wolf"", to me, says that humans are capable of being evil, but NOT werewolves themselves--if one is bitten by a werewolf, this doesn't mean that one will become ""wicked"" any longer necessarily...now this is a subtle shift for the genre, but it does change the nature of fear while simultaneously offering a newer perspective upon Nature as being benevolent rather than hostile, and it also eradicates the notion that it is the Nature inside of Man which makes him evil). In the movie ""Wolf"", we can't depend upon the old laws of religious instruction or superstition to tell us who is going to be evil or who isn't--the monster may not always turn out to be the real monster. Nichols does create an interesting movie here because (despite the theatrical poster's emphasis upon eroticism and thrills) he really does not try to make werewolves into something scary or out-of-control (and it's also interesting to note how werewolves function as a mere element in this drama--on this level alone, ""Wolf"" succeeds as a perfectly written modern fantasy). Man returns to his natural state (becoming a wolf once more after de-evolving out of his learned civilized behaviors and wants) and runs off to join the world that he was always meant for--not the most comforting of messages, but a subtle and brave one. ""Wolf"" is the perfect grown up movie with no sex scenes, no nudity, limited profanity, and no overt scenes of spookiness (compared to others), and with committed performances by actors who seem to have understood more about the director's intentions than most film critics realized at the time of its initial release. Another nice aspect of the film is that the violence is restrained (there is not much gore in the movie at all) so as to not spoil the enjoyable quality of the mystery.
For a long time, I really didn't understand what was new (or at least fresh) about this film, and seeing the ads I thought it would be an overly-sexed werewolf story that was more romance than mystery. Boy was I wrong! Not only do you have the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer on hand, but you also have the nifty cinematography of Giuseppe Rotunno and a script co-written by (a true writer) Jim Harrison (of ""Revenge"" fame) and Wesley Strick (who saved Scorsese's ""Cape Fear"" with his brilliant script). While my initial feeling was that somebody had written a love story about a book editor and then showed it to an executive who said ""hey, know what would make this better? A werewolf!"" and then went back and added a wolf into a very adult-minded story, I now think that the script itself is equally as good as these actors. Recommended, even if you merely want to see a genre experiment taken in a more mature direction. Sadly, the only thing I didn't like about the new DVD edition is that comes without any extras at all...but the movie is still fun. Nichols has created a rousing fairy tale for the present age, and while it is dark in its mystery, it certainly doesn't end up going down the road of your standard American horror movie.

6290648,5,B00ISAFF2C,Satisfying and entertaining. Nicholson makes a very convincing werewolf with minimal special effects,1410393600,,100,6.769230769230769

6290650,5,B00ISAFF2C,"Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) has made it to the top of his publishing career. With no where to go he is sure to be a victim of the latest merger. He has the support of close friends and loyal clients; however that is not enough for him to see any way out but down or out. Little does he know that he is being helped out.

One night driving on a dark snowy road in Wisconsin he encounters and collides with a wolf. Upon investigation of the situation he is nipped.

Turns out this could be the best/worst that that could happen. Now he finds the physical and mental agility to correct his misfortunes. All he needs is the support of a good woman (Michelle Pfeiffer).

Well played scenario. It is not your typical Wolfy movie. You find your self rooting for Will who I think is Jack Nicholson being himself.  One of my favorite scenes is where he is in the mens room and relives himself on a deserving weasel, stating I'm just marking my territory, and you got in the way.",1501286400,,971,4.2896174863387975

6290653,5,B00ISAFF2C,"There are several movies about lycanthropy viz. Werewolf origins.  I have seen a number of DVDs.  Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer and James Spader were the perfect team of lead actors for the perspective ""Wolf"" provides on the subject.  With very particular development of each change from human to werewolf behaviors, the Producers were able to show the transformations with stunning clarity.  Jack NIcholson had twitching of the ears with extraordinary hearing beyond human function.  Then, NIcholson had exceptional smell to proactively act to what was ahead of him and out of sight.  Then Jim Spader is Jack Nicholson's nemesis in their employed positions - and graduates into the lycanthropic realm as a rival for Michelle Pfeiffer's affections.  It is a perfect tale of love - from man to beast - with betrayal with tinges of humor.  So wicked and romantic is this tale about the werewolf legend that it rates a five-star performance.",1498089600,,942,5.111111111111111

6290671,5,B00ISAFF2C,"""Wolf"" gets 5 stars for being an excellent movie, but this product gets 1 star for it's poor DVD release.  I don't want to bring down the rating of this product as that can sometimes confuse consumers into thinking that the movie is only 1 star.  This DVD release has zero extras.  There isn't even a closed captioning option.  The menu bar is an embarrassment too.  This DVD edition only comes with the movie.  If that's all you care about, then you'll be happy with this.  Even if you're not, you don't have much of a choice as this is all the studio is giving you anyway.

When ""Wolf"" came out in theaters, there were all sorts of behind the scenes stuff being aired all over the place.  Where are these files and why were they not included in this release?  Will they ever release another edition of this movie with hours of extras?  Possibly.  But you can forget about a Director's commentary at this point since the Director, Mike Nichols passed away in 2014.  However, the studio can still work to get actors Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer to sit down and give us a commentary, but I wouldn't hold your breath for that either.

There is some interesting back story behind the scenes stuff that most will never know unless they include it in a DVD release.  For one, the Director Mike Nichols had half serious/half jokingly suggested to actress Michelle Pfeiffer if she would put on a red cloak like little red riding hood being hunted down by a wolf, but Michelle flatly refused Mike laughed.

Pfeiffer was offered this role several times, but she kept turning it down.  The main reason is the original script for her character was so small, pointless, and barely existent that she didn't see the point in wasting her time.  Jack Nicholson really wanted her to play the main love interest enough that he had his own private team of writers spruce up and fatten up the leading lady role in the script and re-submitted it to Michelle again.  This worked and got her to commit along with the hefty 6 million dollar paycheck.  Although she pops up in a few scenes sporadically in the first half of the film, it's the second half where the meat of her role is noticed.  These are little tidbits that fans of this film would love to see in behind the scenes vignettes among other things had they been included in this DVD release.

As for the film itself, it's not your typical blockbuster werewolf genre horror film.  It's subdued, mellow, and dramatic.  What would happen if someone was really bitten by a wolf?  And they gradually begin transforming slowly over time where you only notice slight, but obvious changes.  These changes include your senses growing more heightened, soon you can see without your glasses, hear conversations in closed door offices across the hall, and suddenly you have a full head of hair when you were previously losing it.  This is what this film examines, the gradual process of the transformation, rather than the monstrous abrupt changes that would happen in a typical werewolf movie.  For that matter, serious horror fans and maybe even teenagers may be bored with this film as it's more of an adult serious intellectual taste that is low on pointless sensational killings for the purpose of entertainment.  Still the performances are riveting that you can't help but pay attention.  This movie makes turning into a werewolf believable as if it could happen to anyone in real life.",1459900800,4,3426,4.6806020066889635

6290677,1,B00ISAFF2C,"Tragically WOLF will never get the respect it Deserves
one of Jack nicholson's best films brilliantly Directed by Mike Nichols
brilliant make up effects by Rick baker
 that will never get a Decent HD transfer or Decent Digital remaster transfer
or new special features, this film has never ever received a new Audio commentary or making of featurette etc
Despite it's been reissued on dvd twice now and released on Blu-ray once
with no special features at all except for the usual theatrical trailer

i believe it is to late for this film to get a special edition treatment
considering the Director Mike Nichols passed away (Died) about 1 year ago from Heart attack at 83
but at least Columbia pictures/sony pictures who own this film
could get a new retrospect interview with Jack nicholson & Michelle Pfeifer at least
but tragically it's not going to happen
sony have reissued the film on DVD once again as 20th Anniversary edition
well it's bulls*** marketing, cause there's no new extras no new retrospect featurette
with Jack or Michelle, just the usual theatrical trailer is all your going to get
very Disgusting effort from Sony pictures what else is new with them
not even the blu-ray version of WOLF has any new extras, not even the theatrical trailer
this new dvd is worth $1, the blu-ray version maybe worth $5 based on new HD transfer but that's it
5 stars for the film that's for sure, 1 star for this new dvd reissue just a recycle of the very old dvd version",1447200000,3,1473,4.661538461538462
