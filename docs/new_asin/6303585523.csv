684197,5,6303585523,"About a year ago I checked out Musical Mansion from our library for my grandson, who was 5 at the time.  We could only keep it for 3 days but he must have watched it 10 times.  Every time we passed the library he asked  me to get the video again.  Since the videos are on a revolving schedule I  didn't expect to find it for a while.  I did finally ask the librarian if  she could special order it for me.  For some reason she couldn't find it  county-wide on her computer, thinking it may have been damaged and removed  from the collection.  Just yesterday I asked her again and she commented  that it must be good because many others had requested it.  It was then I  thought to see if Amazon. com had it and the rest has a happy ending. It's  funny to think how much kids love this cute video.",922579200,5,796,4.077922077922078

684395,5,6303585523,My 11 month old watches this DVD on average about once a day.  It magically ends fussiness and is a lifesaver when I need to deal with laundry..and it's MARVELOUS (haha).  It's also intelligent enough that my husband and I can stand to hear/see it on a daily basis.  We have successfully learned all the songs! My son is especially responsive to Andy Bandyman and Meter the Mouse! I grew up with the Wee Sing cassette tapes and books.  I like the educational nature of the movie as well as the overall values projected through the Wee Sing products.  I bought my son Wee Sing Songs and Fingerplays (the original) and Wee Sing Bible Songs for his first birthday and am excited to share that experience with my son.,1430870400,,713,4.496124031007752

I especially love the song ""How do I write a Melody"" because it really does give children a formula for writing their own melody, easily.  This one is a keeper!!!",1334966400,,304,4.333333333333333

I strongly suggest it be added to any child's video library.",1325894400,,327,4.586206896551724
684645,5,6303585523,"Most of the Wee Sing videos we have so far are pretty good.  I don't really like the Wee Sing Train DVD; the Musical Mansion DVD is much better.

684719,5,6303585523,"If you are looking for a way to introduce the ""boring"" part of music - theory - to your elementary music classes look no further! It wasn't until I was watching this movie with a 4th grade class during my student teaching that I realized that part of the reason I understood so much about music was due to watching this video over and over as a child. I often tell people that the reason I chose to play the French horn is because the lady who plays the horn in the Doodle Det Quintet wore pink!

Now that I have a classroom, and need to come up with new ideas as to how to introduce different musical ideas, I often turn to this video.  One day while watching the video I decided to write down questions and have created a worksheet for my students. With questions like:
Q. Who is the time keeper of the clock, that also tells us what time signature a piece of music is written?
Q. What are the musical terms explained in Tap A Capella Singers, and what do they mean?
Not to mention songs that are a great introduction to different topics such as musical terms (Tap A Capella singers), instrument families (Doodle Det Quintet), rounds (Ruben and Rachel), and writing melodies (The Melody Song).

If you are an elementary music teacher, this video is great investment!!",1264809600,,1269,4.414529914529915
684720,5,6303585523,"I can't say enough good things about this video.  2-5 year olds will adore this video, the songs are catchy (I love their rendition of ""When the Saints Come Marching In""), and it is not overdone with effects.  My complaint about newer children's videos is that they play to the notion of short attention span, seemingly cutting to new material every few moments.  I think that this fun video exhibits great values...and wow, the music will make you keep on playing it - not only for the kids but for the whole family (just wait until granddad sings along too!).  Timeless and wonderful.",1245801600,,586,4.660194174757281

Now that I'm older, I can remember how much joy and excitement it brought me to see everything from small music toys magically coming to life, to the musical steps in Uncle Rubato's colorful, one-of-a-kind musical mansion.

684788,5,6303585523,"This, along with Grandpa's Magical Toys and Wee Sing in Sillyville, was one of my FAVORITE movies growing up and, while I haven't seen the DVD yet, I would buy it even if it is the same quality as it was on VHS simply because a DVD will last longer! The songs are catchy and great for kids, and as a kid, I was fascinated by the mansion and all of its surprises. This is a GREAT kids' movie- make sure that yours don't miss out!",1118793600,15,428,3.988372093023256

(and just as entertaining as when I was 3, I might add) I truly love this movie. All of the Wee Sing movies are awesome for that matter!

Best of all, momma still remembered all the words and sang along. What a lovely way to introduce musical instruments and musical departments. My hat it has three corners...
