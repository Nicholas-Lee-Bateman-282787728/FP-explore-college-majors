8542137,5,B009IWWB5S,"When you take a documentary film that fully captures the excellence of one instrument and irresistably compels the viewer to promote that same excellence in his own congregation, and you frame it in a setting to match such content - elegantly planned, expertly crafted, visually appealing, intellectually engaging, and clean in every way - there can only be one result. You will leave people awestruck - both at God and at his gifts to humans. This documentary did no less for me. I highly recommend it.",1349654400,,503,4.8604651162790695
