494337,4,6302670322,"I give WHISPERS IN THE DARk an extra star for attempting to say something about adult sexuality, an area into which very few American movies seem to want to venture.  Annabella Sciorra stars as Ann, a young psychiatrist with trust issues of her own.  She has been unable to keep any relationship going with any man.  The one boyfriend she's living with has a serious drinking problem and on top of it confronts her (underneath a terribly symbolic painting of a wailing girl) with an ultimatum that he's leaving her, adding insult to injury because she realizes she should long ago have stepped up to the plate and walked out on *his* ass instead of vice versa.

Most of Ann's immediate problems stem from her interactions with her two star patients, an artist and his dealer.  John Leguizamo's the artist, born with a curse that sets him apart from his fellow man: when he meets a beautiful woman, he doesn't want to make love to her, he wants to hear her whimper with suffering.  Leguizamo contributes a convincing portrayal of a total creep, but he's so little you wonder could he really do any damage to anybody?  How tall is he, five feet one?  Even Annabella Sciorra seems to tower over him and she's a tiny little thing.  However Leguizamo's black leather pants were expertly fitted and give him enough of the old Hollywood oomph to make this a great debut for him, even though you've seen him do this shtick in every role he's played since then.  Ann's other patient, Eve, the gallerist, is played by the one and only Deborah Kara Unger (here billed before she thought of adding ""Kara"" to her name) in a completely over the top performance as a woman who can't stay dressed for more than a few minutes at a time.  She's like Anna Nicole Smith here, or Anita Ekberg in 8 1/2, a big mountain of sex like a vanilla ice cream sundae.  Annabella Sciorra wonders if she's attracted to Eve; well, of course she is, you'd have to be made of stone not to respond to Eve.  And Eve seems attracted to her; during one session, she confesses her desire to take off all her clothes and to masturbate in front of her shrink.  Okay.

All three stars are great and they're backed up by an interesting passel of thesps including Jill Clayburgh, who once played all the variations on the part Sciorra landed here--the worried, independent, neurotic NY professional woman.  Jill Clayburgh gives one speech while jogging at a good clip of about twenty miles an hour, and it's a long speech too!  (About getting so worked up by listening of patients' erotic revelations that she would switch their appointments to the end of the day so that she'd hear them out, then rush home and rape Leo.)  (Her husband, not Leo Di Caprio.)

Leo is played by Alan Alda.  The rape thing is supposed to be amusing, but given the way it plays out in the film it gives you the cold chills when you rewind and play it forward again.",1138579200,6,2898,4.515325670498084
494338,4,6302670322,"Whispers in the Dark (1992), an entertaining whodunit/whydunit, may also fall conveniently under the category, ""white-collar thriller"". Similar to films produced around this period: Malice (1993), Hand that Rocks the Cradle (1992), and Single White Female (1992), Whispers in the Dark focuses its attentions on Ann Hecker (Annabella Sciorra) whose psychiatric practice may suffer irreparably as a result of engaging the attentions of Doug McDowell (Jamey Sheridan), a robust pilot who flirts with Ann one morning while standing in a crowded elevator.

What begins as a minor flirtation sets in motion a series of events, one of which results in the murder of one of Ann's clients, Eve Abergray (Deborah Kara), who had a history of exploring sexually deviant acts with an unnamed boyfriend of similar erotic tastes. As the film progresses, Ann has just cause to suspect Doug of foul play. Larry Morgenstern (Anthony LaPaglia), a tough and unflinching detective, harasses Ann for her session notes and resents what he feels to be the inanities of her chosen profession. Yet as the film continues, Crowe offers a higher body count than one would expect from the closed world of artists and their attendant shrinks. At any given point, anybody might be capable of murder. Ann's mentor, Leo Green (Alan Alda), a likeable and easy going director of psychiatric medicine, aids Ann in her own need to process a past that has left her haunted and troubled, particularly in her relations with men.

At the conclusion of the film, one wonders if Crowe's intention was to offer a timely critique of helping professions. Crowe weaves into his storyline, the limits of psychiatric medicine by throwing into relief those moments when professionals fail to apprehend accurately the real danger brewing just beneath the surface. Sciorra and Sheridan give decent performances as potential lovers seeking one another in the midst of a murder investigation. Whether they end up with one another is part of the mystery. For another example of a thriller which moves the sophistication notch up a few levels, view Lantana (2001) which also stars Anthony LaPaglia.",1117411200,12,2141,5.1671469740634
494339,4,6302670322,"Annabella Sciorra is VERY sexy in this film as a psychiatrist who is trying to both treat her patients' dysfunctional behavior as well as her own bizarre sexuality at the same time.  Her performance alone is worth the price of the DVD.

The other big name in the cast is Alan Alda of MASH (Hawkeye Pierce) fame.  There were times in this movie that I thought it was the Hawkeye Pierce inside of Alda that relished the chance to slam psychologists.

While the plot is fairly predictable, there are a few unexpected twists and turns along the way.  The most thought-provoking aspect of the movie is just how unwieldy & powerful that shrinks can get.  This is something that scares me - especially if they're vindictive and / or crazy themselves!

If you're looking for a dark & erotic psychological thriller, this one might be up your alley.  I can think of worse ways to spend my evenings than having Annabella Sciorra as a guest on the screen of my HDTV!",1101859200,5,954,4.538011695906433
494340,3,6302670322,"An uneasy mixture of thrills, chills and camp, ""Whispers in the Dark"" came out the same time as ""Basic Instinct"" and, although it lacks the high cheese factor that distinguishes that film, it has its moments. Psychiatrist Ann Hecker (Annabella Sciorra) is trapped in a dead end relationship which makes listening to one of her patient's (Deborah Unger in a sultry, memorable performance)unusual sexual exploits difficult. Seeking solice she seeks advice from her mentor (Alan Alda). When she becomes involved with a man (the underrated and great Jamey Sheridan) she meets in an elevator, she finds some fulfulliment. Then one of her patient's is murdered and evidence points to her new boyfriend as a possible suspect her world is turned upside down.

With a twist ending out of Agatha Christie (albeit involving sexual jealous as a motive), ""Whispers in the Dark"" is a bit uneven but a throughly enjoyable mystery thriller that you might see Lifetime (although without the sexual explicitness). Christopher Crowe (screenwriter of ""The Last of the Mohicans"")does a great job directing his screenplay. With memorable performances from a strong supporting cas including Jill Clayburgh, John Leguizamo and Anthony LaPaglia, ""Whispers in the Dark"" doesn't come with any extras on DVD but has a nice transfer that looks sharp with solid color reproduction.",1095206400,8,1351,5.283720930232558
494341,3,6302670322,"Unger nailed her part as an obsessive patient perfectly but Sciorra seems to blunder around this film, not suspecting her mentor until the very end.  I would think that if you could suspect your boyfirend so quickly and see that his face wasn't exactly real you would suspect everyone.  Instead of goign that route, it makes her tunnel focused on teh always charismatic Sheridan as teh main suspect.
Great actors, with a story that doesn't quite shock.",1049068800,,452,4.857142857142857
494342,1,6302670322,"Recent Soprano mistress, Annabella Sciorra plays a Manhattan therapist who gets in a complete mess and a murderous tangle with a new boyfriend and patient. The plot in this film is just absurd. It is a mess and you find your self screaming at Sciorra not to be such an idiot. The detective is not much better and the conclusion looks tacked on. Not a good whodunnit. Not much of anything.
It has a good cast, but the script is hopeless. The plot makes no sense, Sciorra breaks every ethical rule of therapy and the whole film is a waste of time. I do not think this will make an Alan Alda retrospective. Infact most of the cast have gone onto better things and that is the best you can say about it.",1044057600,3,699,4.2631578947368425
494343,2,6302670322,"A number of characters in this movies are sexually disturbed, and it is a matter of guessing which one of them is a killer. I won't give away the plot, but, somewhat predictably, none of the patients are guilty. And the real killer documents his crimes on tape so diligently that you have to wonder if this detail is an intentional insult directed to the audience. The movie is occasionally sexy, but unfortuantely, some moments are also nauseatingly grusome. All in all, this thriller is neither that thrilling, nor exciting.",998179200,2,526,4.855555555555555
494344,3,6302670322,"WHISPERS IN THE DARK has a terrific screenplay.  It's an overlooked gem of a plot. In the claustrophobic world of New York upperclass psychiatrists, there are doctor-patient intrigues, patient-patient intrigues, and  doctor-doctor intrigues.  Like walking through a minefield.  The author not  only manages to keep them all in the air at the same time, but adds in a  murder mystery with genuine surprises like a classical whodunnit.  At the  end of the movie I felt like standing up and shouting ""REMAKE!""  except it would have been futile because I was watching the VHS tape alone.  The Hollywood moguls missed a good bet when they underfinanced this  script.  Christopher Crowe, who wrote the brilliant script, just isn't a  brilliant director.  You can tell because he had a superstar, Alan Alda,  and got a lot less out of him than Alda could have delivered.  The rest of  the cast wasn't star quality.  Leonard Maltin says there were  ""standout performances,"" but I have to disagree.  Just imagine  what a huge hit this film would be if it had a great director and a cast of  real actors like Sharon Stone or Nicole Kidman in the female lead, Elliot  Gould in the Alan Alda role (not that Gould is a better actor than Alda,  but he can be more menacing), and William Hurt as co-star.  In fact, I  think this movie will be remade some day--the story is just that good!  Meanwhile, should you see it? Indeed yes, if you like a well-plotted tale  moderately-well told.",965001600,3,1471,4.73015873015873
494345,1,6302670322,"Giving a performance that quite possibly stands as the worst in the history of cinema, Alan Alda sheds his sensitive image in favor of pure, unadulterated madness. Why the atypical role? Only Alda and his agent know  for certain, but one wonders if he read the script prior to filming. Was it  the scene when he got to smash a wine bottle against his wife's head? Was  it the scene when he floated on the waves, dead, with a grappling hook  embedded in his skull? Or perhaps it was the scene when he pounded his own  chest in frustration and anger then returned, instantly, to mouse-like  calmness? Whatever the reason, let us appreciate what Alda has given us: a  film that will stand the test of time as a true guilty pleasure. The plot,  which attempts to replicate the sexual kinkiness of ""Basic  Instinct,"" is pointless and dull, and one must wait almost two hours  to get to Alda's meltdown. Still, how many films can you name where a  killer records his confessions on clearly labeled tapes (even down to the  date, time, and topic!) and expresses shock when they are found? The late  Gene Siskel once described this film (and Alda's performance) as  ""howlingly bad."" That just about says it all.",961113600,5,1203,4.613207547169812

494429,4,6302670322,"Whispers in the Dark is a sexy, whodunit thriller with a huge twist that I didn't see coming. I love it when that happens.

This isn't one of Sciorra's best performances, but it doesn't matter. Alan Alda takes the prize.

I removed one star because of the finale. Whereas I love movies where the female lead doesn't need a man to jump in and save her at the last minute, the ending was a disappointing cop-out. A movie with such an intricate storyline deserved a more sophisticated ending. This ending was more fitting for a sequel to Friday the 13th.",1334880000,,551,4.5

494431,5,6302670322,"Psychiatrist Ann Hecker is ending one relationship and possibly starting an important new one, while finding that some of the sexual exploits her patients relate are weighing on her. Turning to a married friend from her research days for guidance, she finds his help increasingly important when a female patient is murdered and it turns out that her new boyfriend was also seeing the dead woman. This movie ""Whispers in the Dark"" keeps you guessing to who the killer is, and when he finally revealed himself his actions were so eerily slow and psychotic that it took you a while to realize that he was at all capable of committing the sick and murderous acts that he did in the movie. The ending is a bit hard to take. This is worth watching.",1267056000,,742,4.586466165413534
494432,4,6302670322,"4 of 5 stars for the suspense movie Whispers of the Dark. One of the hallmarks of a great suspense movie is that you don't see ""who"" is behind the events until the critical moment. This movie meets that standard! Lots of odd suspenseful things happening with the finger of blame going in one direction, but, surprise, its another character AND you don't get this news until the last concluding scenes.

THe story is about a lady shrink and a couple of her patiences. The lady patience has the hots for the lady shrink doctor. Next we learn that our lady shrink has a new boyfrend who happens to be the x-boyfriend of our lady patience. Throw in a couple of murders a few extra characters and things look pretty grim until we find out who really has the hots for our lady shrink.

A very good suspense movie. Alot of adult themes and nudity. It will keep you guessing. Oh, to the credit of the writer/director, they wrap the story quickly and end without alot of extra junk. I do recommend this movie!",1254614400,,1000,4.429347826086956

This movie is clearly an opportunity to cash in on ""Basic Instinct's"" success. The film deals both with psychotherapy, and excessive amounts of sex. The police lieutenant is a ripe candidate for analysis - wonder if that accomplished anything judging from the film.",1138579200,2,552,4.63265306122449
