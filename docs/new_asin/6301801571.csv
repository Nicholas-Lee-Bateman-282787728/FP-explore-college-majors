368501,5,6301801571,"I love this film!  Small Circle captures the essence of the late sixties' imagination and possibilities; it embraces the era's sense of romance while examining its explosive political and cultural turmoil.  The film focuses on the relationships of three young people as they go through four years at Harvard, circa 1967-1971, the peak of sixties' awareness and excesses.  While there may be some weaknesses in the filmmaker's attempts to cover as much as possible from the sixties in terms of issues  (an aspect of the film I particularly adore but others do not), the depth of the three friends' love and commitment to each other ties everything together.  Brad Davis' intense energy is alive even in this early film of his--his talent is sorely missed.",1104105600,15,754,5.0

368503,1,6301801571,"The most resonant element of director Rob Cohen's film is the music score by Jim Steinman, which includes the melody that was later recorded as Total Eclipse of the Heart. Otherwise this tale of a supposed menage-a-tois between Harvard university students Brad Davis, Karen Allen and Jameson Parker is as dramatic as the cartoon opening and closing sketches. The screenplay by Ezra Sacks attempts coverage of the Vietnam era from 1967 to 1971 from a student activist point of view, but the tri-romance hardly seems from the same era since it isn't until towards the end that there is any suggestion of bigamy. There is also even less suggestion of homosexuality interest between Davis and Parker. When the 3 finally go into the same bedroom, the camera is left outside and the door closed. Their lack of involvement in activism is paralled with the radicalisation of a Texan boy scout who comes to Harvard at the same time and ends up a terrorist, and highlighted by a campus riot that comes out of nowhere. Even the Vietnam connection as a comment on the relationship and vice versa doesn't work. Sacks opens with Parker reuniting with Allen in ""the present"" before we start flashbacking to 1967, with Davis' absence pre-empting the outcome, and Cohen supplies matching love scene montages. Davis' has steam so apparently is more erotic and ends abruptly, whilst Parker's is set to Chances Are and ends more positively. Sacks has 2 lines I liked - a technique of breaking into a glass window ""I saw it on I Spy or was it The Untouchables"", though Cohen repeats it, and ""Only men would come up with a draft lottery using balls"". Utilising period TV and photographic images - the assassinations of the Kennedy's and Martin Luther King - and a series of bad wigs, the only sense of reality and truth comes in a moment when someone sings the Star Spangled Banner to TV closure. Davis has the impossible charming/wild man role, not helped by his looking older than the others, and the best he can do is stare child-like for vulnerability. Allen doesn't have a strong screen persona so it's easy to think one is watching Amy Irving or Janet Margolin or Brooke Adams. Of the 3, Parker probably comes off best even when saddled with a Colonel Sanders look. His character's basic dullness is probably the reason he needs to be reunited with Allen. Even when the competition is Davis, anyone that prefers to experiment with rats rather than go to an Ingmar Bergman film is definitely worth reconsidering as a partner.  Watch for Shelley Long as a photographer, and Daniel Stern, billed as Dan.",1000512000,8,2584,4.767857142857143
7815735,4,6301801571,"Released in 1980, A Small Circle of Friends is a drama about three friends at Harvard & Radcliffe College during the turbulent years 1967-1971. The protagonists are played by Brad Davis, Karen Allen and Jameson Parker. John Friedrich and Shelley Long are on hand as peripheral students.

This is a good realistic drama about life at college during the late 60s & early 70s in America. The movie showcases the political and social craziness of those times and how it changed the students, for better or worse. Its akin to 2000s underrated The 70s but maybe a notch better. There are several highlights and even glimpses of greatness, like The Star-Spangled Banner being sung by an African-America cook from the university while sitting at a bar, a few curvy cuties, a pre-Cheers Shelley Long, a hilarious stage sequence, the absurd Vietnam draft lottery, and an unexpectedly shocking climax.

There are also a couple of great songs from the era, like the Stones Street Fighting Man, but there shouldve been more instead of overdoing the sappy Theme for the Masses. I should warn that theres one element in the last act thats just gross, but it happened then and now. As solid as A Small Circle of Friends is, its thoroughly obscure; somehow it fell through the cracks when it was released.

The film runs 113 minutes and was shot entirely in Massachusetts (Cambridge, Bridgewater & Groton). It was directed by Rob Cohen and written by Ezra Sacks.

7815739,4,6301801571,"It's always been difficult for American films to deal with the 1960s honestly -- so many wind up taking the easy shortcut of stereotypes & generational cliches, rather than exploring the period & its players in real depth. ""A Small Circle of Friends"" doesn't entirely escape that trap, but it is a brave attempt to capture the atmosphere & urgency of the times. Its greatest flaw, I think, is trying to say too much all at once, so that some issues get only cursory attention & name-checking.

That said, the film does very well in evoking the energy & intoxicating mixture of fear & hope that characterized the 1960s for a crucial section of youth. I remember very well the dread of waiting to see what my draft lottery number would be; I remember equally well the feeling that revolution was in the air, that all things were possible, that the world could indeed be changed for the better. And in following the lives of this particular small circle of friends, the film conveys a great deal of that feeling & makes it genuine.

The cast is solid, with a lovely, intelligent Karen Allen & a charming Jameson Parker; but I have to call special attention to the intense, magnetic Brad Davis, who radiates emotion & electricity in every scene. Yes, the triangle of friendship & love recalls both the film ""Jules and Jim"" & the song ""Triad"" as it's meant to ... but it also expresses something very real, a willingness to test limits, an eagerness to explore. And in the stories of the supporting players, we're given miniature portraits of both realized potential & inevitable tragedy, as in the transformation of a naive small-town boy into a bomb-making radical.

As for the Jim Steinman score, I'm not all that wild about it -- but I appreciate the decision to try something other than the typical handful of 1960s songs in lieu of a real score. For me, it's an experiment that didn't really succeed; but I'm glad they were willing to try it. What could be more 1960s than going for something different?

The film is framed as a flashback, bookended by the chance meeting between two of the leads years after the event. It's a little pat, but perhaps that's the point -- the tumultuous, mercurial hippie days have given way to the dawn of the more placid & complacent yuppie era, leaving its protagonists a lot more settled & secure, but also a little lost, hungering for something precious they left behind. The commentary track delves into this dichotomy a bit & is well worth hearing, by the way. Clearly this first film for director Rob Cohen was very much a personal labor of love, and the commentary is really a memoir & essay, a vital component of the film.

All in all, it's a small film that becomes more poignant as it goes along, especially if you were young during the events it portrays. And for those born after the fact, it's a heartfelt look at a time that seems more fantastic & impossible as the years go by -- a time when creating a meaningful life was far more important than simply making more money than you'll ever need -- a time long gone by, alas.

7815740,5,6301801571,"I first met this movie in 1980, a young man of eighteen - a life full of adventure ahead in my college years. The performances of Brad Davis, Karen Allen, and Jameson Parker made a lasting impression on my head, heart, and soul. Leo, Nick, and Jessie are characters in a story both familiar and lasting. I first found the movie on cable - must have watched it twenty times if once. Then, didn't see it again until I ordered it from Amazon. Kudos to MGM for putting this title out (certainly not a blockbuster but a worthy release from its vault). It's a story of friendship, love, rebellion, youth, growing up, politics, art, and the messiness of life. Highly recommended from this fan!",1382918400,6,686,4.540322580645161
7815741,5,6301801571,Great cast came together in this movie. This was interesting movie with how they came together on this movie and played their roles. They all went on to be more famous afterward.,1346112000,,178,4.59375
7815742,1,6301801571,"I will say one thing for this Cohen movie:  unlike the 80s actors of my generation who were obsessed with the 60s, this movie actually feels like it was filmed back then...to a degree.  I'm so sorry, but if you have read my profile, you just already know what I'm going to say.  Jim Steinman's music for one thing:  I recognized ""Total Eclipse of the Heart,"" ""Making Love Out of Nothing at All,"" and ""Faster than the Speed of Night"" in the soundtrack.  A subpar pop composer for Meatloaf and Bonnie Tyler can't find anything new to compose, and neither can his henchman find any new ground to break about the 60s.

Brad Davis's character, easily the most appealing and annoying by turns is some combination of Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison.  Gee, we didn't see this disturbed pretty boy coming from eons away.  Jameson Parker, who spends most of the time either looking like a 1979 era Roger McGuinn or same era Andrew Gold is boring and makes me want to puke.  He got into a BAR FIGHT!  WOW!  Karen Allen?  Don't get me started.  Want to talk about overacting?  She's the worst.  If there is something going on between these three characters, Cohen does more of a brushing up on it than Natalie Wood did in her Gypsy striptease sequences, but that's okay.  I know Cohen basically used David Crosby's ""Triad"" for the very basis of this tripe anyway, and it shows in spades.  This is two hours of my life I'll never get back, and the hillbilly underground explosion wasn't even rewarding.

Take my generation as we are.  I'd still prefer our movie, 1969, to this horrible posturing.  At least you know Robert Downey Junior, Keifer Southerland, and Wynona Ryder had more sincerity in their performances, and the music was ten times better.",1304812800,,1734,4.604575163398692
7815743,3,6301801571,"""A Circle of Friends"" was obviously a low-budget film that dealt with life in the 60's and 70's.  This film includes the Vietnam War, the drug culture, free sex and hard-hitting personal issues.  It took me a while to get through the movie because I felt it could have been done so much better.  The script was juvenile and so predictable.  The acting was, well, over-acted, melodramatic and did not showcase these three actor's potential.  But with what they had to work with, this is a good movie for young people to see who did not live through these eras.  It showcased a time of unrest amongst the young and taking it upon themselves to change the country's stale direction.  Unfortunately, we  have gone back to the stale way of running things.  I miss the changes that took place by a nationwide multitude of young people fighting for causes and making sure the government knew how we felt.  Now, I feel like a sheep just mixed in with the apathetic herd.  Baaaaa.  If you have not lived through these eras, please see this film.  See what WE did for YOU.",1291075200,,1062,4.526315789473684
