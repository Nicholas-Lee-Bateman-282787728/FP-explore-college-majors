8175090,4,B000N60HCC,"Another Whirlwind Percussion Tour from Chino along with Jorge Gonzalez (Bongos) and George Delgado (Congas).
Fast paced, no nonsense  - with excellent Play Along targeted at comfortable Improvers to beginning Advanced.
This DVD will also be of value as a refresh/prep for your next gig or if taking up a new percussion instrument.

There is a  quick recap but you will need to know the basic patterns/rhythms as no 'dots' are included, nor hostages taken (reference website with the patterns would be of great benefit).
It covers -
  - Cumbia 'Pati' (with Tim bales, Congas and Guiro)
  - Bomba (Timbales, Congas & Guiro)
  - Plena (Timbales,Congas, Guiro & Cowbells)
  - Danzon (Timbales, Congas & Guiro)
  - Caballo (Timbales, Congas, Bongos & Cowbells)

In the intro to each instrument and pattern the DVD has very good simultaneous multishot  Front, Side and from Above Views.
A shame this was not continued into the Playalong sequence. There is a separate Play Along section with  various instruments omitted to allow you to play along.

 If you are joining a band I would suggest you get your play along practice with the previous DVD (Toma Uno) 'The Rhythmic Construction of a Salsa Tune' Vol 1 with Pablo Chino Nunez [Latin Percussion] ISBN:0757915558. Vol 1 covers  (cha cha cha, Son Montuno, Guaracha & Latin Rock).

For advanced 'Percussion Melodies' ('Colors')' and other percussion effects or are into new percussion instruments (Talking Drum/Udu, Udongo, Jambe, Cajon, Agogo, Chimes, Far East Bells etc)  see  Steve Thornton's excellent 'Rhythmic Construction of World Music' [LP] ISBN: 07579-13555.

If you are interested in how other instruments interact go for Poncho Sanchez's DVD - 'Fundamentals of Latin Music for the Rhythm Section' [Cherry Lane]ISBN:1575607565 and 'Latin Jazz Grooves' Featuring Victor Mendoza  ASIN: B0006N2DSS.

Missing:-
It is missing the dots, my version was not  multiregional (all instructional DVDs should be).
A shame the multiview shots were not continued into the Playalong pieces.

But well worth the money, I await 'Toma Tres' from the Maestro. This series will act as a Band Percussionist's Repertoire Reference (maybe the next series will inclue - Merengue, Bachata, Songo, Timba, Bolero, Techniques, crossovers etc).

TIP:
If it is too fast paced, focus on one hand, then the other and finally combine the hands.",1178496000,3,2366,5.237333333333333
