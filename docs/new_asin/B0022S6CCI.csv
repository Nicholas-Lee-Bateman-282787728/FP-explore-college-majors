8349656,5,B0022S6CCI,"This film is nearly 90 years old and is a very important record of filmmaking and social mores during the last year of Prohibition in the middle of the Great Depression. It is hard to find online and next to impossible to find on DVD save this Spanish version.

Pert Kelton is another extremely talented actress who is hard to see outside of this film and the film that catapulted her to fame, The Bowery, undoubtedly due to the post war horrific Communist witch hunts that killed many a career, buried hundreds of accomplishments and squeezed the life out of hundreds of hard working Americans. Later, Kelton was the one first chosen to star alongside Jackie Gleason in the original Honeymooners, you can see a little of her performance in the pilots on YouTube. She was great, a lot of people will never know how iconic she would've been in that TV show had she been given the green light.  I'm glad to have this old film as another testament to her skills.

This film shows a sad era where women, just over ten years into the right to vote, had virtually nothing else to protect them as stand alone citizens. It also shows the roots of image equated with advantage and privilege over the rights of citizens regardless of color or sex. It was made smack in the middle of the golden opportunity for real estate moguls which crushed the life out of millions of working people. It was part of the then fervor to understand what a city was, especially in the city that drove it all, New York City, and why heaven and hell existed right across the street from, or next door to each other. It was made four years before Stanley Kingsley put Dead End on Broadway and the national stage, bringing the message home about the need to address the plight of working women and neglected children.

There are other points about this film that make it an important historical record that relates to our lives now. Interested people should get a copy while it's still available. This one is clear enough picture and sound-wise, no restoration work seems to have been done. Worth the price.",1478044800,,2075,4.56989247311828
