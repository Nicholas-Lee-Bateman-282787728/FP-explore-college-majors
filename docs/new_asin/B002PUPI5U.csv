8377352,3,B002PUPI5U,"George Washington Carver was a great American who devoted his life to improving the lives of African-Americans, but his influence has been felt by all Americans.  Carver rose from a background of poverty without knowing his parents to become one of the most educated and celebrated men of his time.  Had he patented any of his inventions and discoveries, the Tuskegee Institute would have rivaled Menlo Park.

Carver is one of my favorite American scientists and I was eager to watch GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER: HIS LIFE AND WORKS.  However, though the DVD does provide a solid introduction to the life of Carver, I was a tad disappointed.  The first five minutes or so of the video contain a series of random images from nature with the film's narrator reciting some of Carver's words.  I think this is intended to be an introduction, but it just doesn't work very well.  Once the presentation actually starts talking about Carver and his life, it becomes more interesting.  The film covers Carver's life from his childhood until his death. It also includes several actual silent film clips of Carver as well as one where Carver is talking.

Other than the rather tedious beginning, GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER: HIS LIFE AND WORKS is a decent DVD that provides a solid introduction to the life and works of Carver.  Recommended as a resource for teachers and librarians and for students between 3rd-6th grades.",1269302400,8,1406,4.919491525423729
8377353,5,B002PUPI5U,"This program is excellent for briging together the ""bootstrap"" theory that anyone, if they work hard enough can succeed and that success is not always measured through wealth.  This is a teaching program - about crop rotations, inventions, peanut uses, changing the economy of the South, raising up poor black farmers through education and giving,and also the story of who Carver was as a man.  It traces his life from childhood till the end.  A must for any teacher, homeschooler, faith based group, motivational companies, and librarians.  Really appeals to all age groups from 4th grade up.  The production values are exellent as well.",1256774400,9,638,5.096153846153846
