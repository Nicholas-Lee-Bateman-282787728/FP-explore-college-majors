8737571,5,B016YQXA64,"Simply stated, JURASSIC PARK III is much better on disc from the two showings I saw in the theatre. For one thing the images are much sharper and crisp than seen on the silver screen. This alone makes it worth having on disc. Also, and probably more important JURASSIC PARK III is a good film. Its quite a change of pace from its two predecessors. It takes getting used to. There is actually a much more solid plot line and even character development evident from when I first saw it. The film moves at a fast pace or so it appears that it may gloss over you if you were expecting something different. I would have to say that I really enjoyed this movie on disc. It looks and sounds great. Good action and suspense all around.",1523059200,,727,4.313868613138686
