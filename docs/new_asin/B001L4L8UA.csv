8317212,4,B001L4L8UA,"Broad in contextual coverage of Malibu & Huntington Beach of southern California; and of Maverick's way north near Half Moon Bay. Good interviews. But the classic must have DVDs are 'Riding Giants', 'Liquid Stage', 'Endless Summer, I & II', and Powerlines' production of 'Maverick's- High Noon at Low Tide'. Consider also 'Surfing for Life'- for sober, thoughtful documentary of some well known surfers from their early age to their sunset years.",1349827200,,446,5.295774647887324
8317213,4,B001L4L8UA,"Good little kind of documentary or Malibu, Huntington Beach, and Maverick's near Half Moon Bay. Seem like it is done from the late 90's.",1348444800,,136,4.708333333333333
