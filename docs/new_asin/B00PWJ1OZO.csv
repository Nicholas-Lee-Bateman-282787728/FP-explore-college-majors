8689538,4,B00PWJ1OZO,"This is a great movie out of Russia but it has a lot of violence, not for children. It is well acted and Sergei Bodrov Jr does a great job. He was a wonderful actor and it is too bad he has passed away. Some will love this movie and others won't.",1463011200,,246,3.75
8689539,1,B00PWJ1OZO,One of my favorite movies but this DVD is absolute trash. The quality is horrid and there's an even more horrid red tint on top of it. Look for a different source to get it from...,1434499200,,180,4.027777777777778
8689540,5,B00PWJ1OZO,"I love this movie, I watch it all the time. It really is too bad the lead actor is dead((((((( I highly recommend this movie (and brat 1), to those who love Russian movies, like myself.",1416528000,2,185,4.166666666666667
