8140018,1,B0002SCZUI,"I remember these crimes. They were extensively covered in the British media. Imagine a police chief confronted by seemingly random killings, no motive, totally unconnected, they weren't terrorists, no racial element, impossible to know where or when they would strike next or who would be the victim. A daily nightmare, a town in panic. The advocates of freedom to own firearms in the USA should watch this film, and the disturbing consequences this view can have. Convincingly acted by all concerned A quietly frightening film.",1370390400,,528,5.223529411764706
