1809228,3,B00007G1VV,"I have to agree with Calinira. I was HORRIFIED, when I got my DVD set and started listening to the sound and realized that the dubbing was in ENGLISH ACCENTS!!!!!!! It sounds so funny it's ridiculous. And I know the movies inside and out and they didn't even dub the same words in most parts. Now don't get me wrong, the ORIGINAL English dubbing with the American (almost New York) accents was bad too, but that's what we grew up on. That's what we are used to. As bad as it was, that was almost the charm of watching the Pippi movies. I agree with Calinira that I would MUCH rather listen to the children speak Swedish and read English sub titles then to hear Pippi, Tommy and ANNIKA speak in proper English. It just sounds dumb! Not that I have anything wrong with a proper English accent. I LOVE English accents. JUST NOT COMING OUT OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKINGS MOUTH!! :-)",1105401600,2,870,4.409937888198757
1809229,1,B00007G1VV,"Like other people who have reviewed this Pippi Longstocking DVD I was a child of the 70s who grew up watching the Swedish Pippi Longstocking movies and never knew that they were actually episodes from an old Swedish kiddy show that were strung together for the movies and I loved the idea of watching the TV show versions but like the others I'm very disappointed with the new dubbing. I mean come on, Pippi's friend's name is Annika not Anna. Why in the world did the British makers of this DVD find that they had to change Annika to Anna? Is it hard for British people to pronounce Annika? I think not! I think that just because Anna is one of the most popular names in the UK they felt that Anna would be more acceptable then Annika but I think that was a big mistake and I hope someone decides to put out a new set with better dubbing and will go back to using the correct name of Annika and I like the suggetions of the original Swedish language tracks with English subtitles. It's a shame that this Pippi set is such a disappointment and they should have known that people would notice the difference between Annika and Anna! And as another reviewer said, they should have realize that TRUE Pippi fans would be unhappy! I also agree that they shoudn't have used British slang if they were going to sell this to non-British English speakers. They shouldn't use any slang at all, no British slang, no American slang, etc! Just basic English that everyone can understand!",1094601600,31,1474,4.483271375464684
1809230,4,B00007G1VV,"The British translators had no interest in making the dvds relatable to non-british english speakers. Pippi says things like, ""Cherio"", ""Jolly Good"", and other slang. Simply beastly! She says, ""However does one...?"" instead of ""How can I...?"" Her voice sounds to proper for her character, it is difficult sometimes to know who is talking - Anna, Tommy, Pippi? Their voices are too similar, especially when the dubbers speak when no mouths are moving (and I don't mean the narration). Sometimes the character's mouths move and the dubbers say nothing. I would enjoy the original Swedish with subtitles. As for children, they might not understand much of the British dialogue, I know I blanked out on some of it.",1093046400,11,710,5.02542372881356

1809232,5,B00007G1VV,"I purchased the DVD for my kids.  Having grown up with the movies that were played in the 70 and early 80, I thought that the stories would be great for my kids.  I did not know that the movies were actually hacked together from a TV series.  Now that I have seen the DVD, which is only the first 6 of the series, I really wish that the rest would be brought out on DVD.  More episodes would be great since we watch these at least twice a week.  My son CANNOT get enough of it.
The dubbing, although different that what I remember, is fine.  And since the DVD is for the little ones, they don't care what I remember from the TV movies :)",1080777600,6,637,3.9763779527559056
1809233,5,B00007G1VV,"Inger Nilsson IS Pippi Longstocking for an entire generation, and she is as adorable as ever in beautifully mastered DVD collection.  I had no idea all four of the Swedish theatrical films were edited together from the television series (though the DVD case claims only the first one was -- that's incorrect).
Picture is GORGEOUS -- brilliant colors, razor sharp, little grain, and hardly a spot on the film.  The only drawback, besides no extras, is the lack of an option to play the original Swedish lanuage.
Since the TV series contained scenes that were never in the theatrical features, the original American dubbing was presumably not an option, as it would have been incomplete.  A brand-new dubbed track was created, this time using British actors.  I think the new dubbing is quite good.  The children are actually much better actors than the old American voices from the early 70s.
Hen's Tooth, thank you for finally bringing Pippi to DVD.  Please release the rest of this series... and put the Swedish language track on there!",1065398400,49,1037,4.897142857142857

There were 13 30-minute episodes made in total, so we're talking 6 1/2 hrs of Pippi that was cut into two 1 1/2 hrs films!!!  This DVD contains 6 episodes. Release the rest as well!!!

1809235,4,B00007G1VV,"I was so excited to see this out on dvd. The picture quality is superb compared to the movies of the 70's. However, what keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the british dubbing. The voices are boring and uninteresting.(They could have at least picked some more distinguishable voices.) I was expecting similar dubbing as in the movies. This gives me hope though, that the original movies will come out on dvd!!! This is still great to watch if you are a Pippi fan!

1809257,4,B00007G1VV,"This tv series has similar mad-cap antics as the original Willy Wonka movie.  Video transfer is sharp with vivid color.  Many people have given a thumbs down to the re-dubbed british voices.  While I agree it differs from what I was used to hearing from the 1970's re-edited movies, it does not really detract that much from the fun and joy of this rare Swedish tv.  I wish it had included all 13 episodes instead of just 6 but since this dvd has been out for several years it does not look like we'll get the full series anytime soon.

1809264,4,B00007G1VV,"I remember this series as a young boy, and I enjoyed finding it on DVD.  However, the re-recorded English dubbing leaves something to be desired, although the shows still remain enjoyable.  Anna is really Annika in the original series (and I can still hear her original squeaky voice from the original dubbing from so long ago). And it is also Pippi becomes a thingFINDER, not thinghunter, as dubbed in this collection. And the house is never referred to as Villa Villakulla, only The Big House. And Pippi's full name is very proper and English in the dub. If you have read the book(s)by Astrid Lindgren, you will know her real name - and in some of the liberties taken with rescripting, loses some of the quirkiness that helps makes Pippi so endearing. These are great DVD's for young kids, and you might do well to pair up this DVD with the book set.  Overall, great for a new generation to appreciate. Also, a note to the production team.....nothing in the original Swedish dialect?  That was disappointing.",1301184000,3,1010,4.721590909090909

Yes, they do use some inappropriate language in Pippi, such as ""stupid"" but overall, the series is more wholesome than some other current movies out there.

The TV series comes packaged simply -- no booklets or extras included, just the episodes that make up the very first Pippi movie in the U.S.  They are shown back to back, each from opening to closing credit.

Picture quality is improved and better than in the American collection.

Annika becomes Anna and the children all sport British accents.  Their voices sound very similar and I sometimes had a difficult time telling them apart.  The dubbing is about the same quality, so far as their ability to match the mouth movements.  I prefer the original American dubbing, because the children's voices are more distinctive and animated.

There were some scenes we did not see in the American movie, but I don't think they were very interesting.  The American version was edited well and the scenes flowed smoothly.  In these original episodes, the scenes sometimes changed too abruptly and sometimes lingered too long.

Overall, an interesting addition to the Pippi collection, but if I only had to buy one, I'd buy the American collection.",1265155200,,1625,6.613207547169812

I got it mainly for my four year old daughter and she LOVES it, but my two year old loves it too- heck I love it! Even my French wife (who wasn't fortunate enough to watch Pippy as a child) is into them.

There are even little jokes I am getting now, that went over my head as a boy.

Sure, the transfer isn't excellent, but it's not that bad,either. And frankly, I'm just happy they are on DVD at all. Whoever is giving this Pippy set one and two stars must be living in some cynical parallel universe.

1809280,3,B00007G1VV,"I grew up with Pippi, but not with the American movies of the 70's that everyone seems to be looking for here. I grew up on the 1988 film with Tami Erin! I also read the books over and over.
I've heard great things about this series, especially Inger Nilsson's performance, and I would like to see it. Since the 4 bizarrely chopped and dubbed American versions of this are not part of my nostalgia, I'm skipping those and heading straight to the original 13 episodes! (It seems very wrong to butcher a full television series into 4 movies, changing the dialogue and plot every way you can).

But I see that this DVD only has the 1st 6 episodes? What's a Pippi lover to do?
I will not purchase this dvd, even though I'd like to see it, because I couldn't bear to love it and then only have half of the 13 episodes available to me. Also, I see that there is a lot of criticism of the British dubbing here, and no option to watch it in the original Swedish.

Ideally, I would be able to buy all 13 episodes, with an option for English dubbing, and an option for the original Swedish with subtitles! Until then, I guess I'll have to keep waiting.",1231372800,5,1142,4.258064516129032

1809297,2,B00007G1VV,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!! the 4 box DVD set was the one I had been looking for!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!

I was swayed a little and confused by the reviews that people left here about the TV Series DVD vs the 4 DVD Pipi Collection so I bought both the 4 DVD set & the TV series DVD to be sure that I was getting what I was looking for.

And also to hopefullyhelp me to leave for you a clearer more helpful review.

When looking for my version of this Pipi memory I also discovered that many people have their own generation version of the Pippi that was theirs.

I was looking for the one from when I was a little youth born in 1975 and grew up on Vancouver Island and enjoyed Pipi most of my life. I wanted to bring back those ""oh so dear to my heart"" childhood memories of Pipi... and the 4 DVD box set was it.

If you remember watching Pipi as a feature film and the girls name was Annika than the 4 DVD set is for you.

If you remember watching Pipi as a TV Series and the girls name was Anna not Annika then the TV Series DVD is the one for you.

Having grown up with the 4 DVD box set version as my memories

the ""TV Series DVD"" to me was disappointing but watchable. They did change Annika to Anna and the children were not as joyful in the dubbing, and the dialogue is certainly different. You are watching the same images but, you do get another storyline perspective of Pipi. You do learn different things about Pippi from the TV Series DVD that you would not have otherwise known with the box set, but it's nothing necessary to know, it is not money needed to be spent if it is the Annika version you are looking for...unless you have it to spend and would like to give it a try as well or vice versa to those were actually seeking the TV Series version.

As well, the images are pieced together differently to produce a different story in images as well as dialogue.

Maybe this could help clarify...

One Example:

4 DVD Box set

When Tommy and Annika come to give Pippi the candy box she gives them gifts too. A Harmonica and a ball.

TV Series DVD

Pipi is looking for her bag of gold gives Tommy a pocket knife (which kinda shocked me) and Anna a hair comb, I think it was.

 But honestly, for me the TV Series DVD has been viewed once and is collecting dust on my shelf and does not have the same joy to me as the one I grew up with. The 4 box DVD set.

The 4 DVD Boxed set is definately the English dubbed Pipi I remember in all it's Glory!!! to the nostalgic soundtrack scratch (that I guess is what could be what is being misinterpreted as smoking voices in the 4 DVD collection reviews) *shrug* Pipi's big burley papa could have sounded this way, I guess...but, I just thought that it was cuz he was her big strong "" Captain of the South Seas"" papa *GRIN*

So whichever of these Pippi releases remind ""you"" of the Pippi that you wanted to be friends with or even BE! Joy to you and YOUR Pipi memories *smile*

 Hope this helps! And if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask I will help you if I can.",1153526400,147,3012,4.08843537414966

The most important dissappointment to me was the fact that I childishly taught my children PIPI's THEME SONG! Did anyone notice that she didn't sing it in one episone? I'm so bummed.

Even so some scenes are longer than necessary and longer than I remembered from my childhood, Pippi is pleasure pure for any child and the child within us grown ups!  Sad though that the English dubbing of Pippi's voice does not reflect her energetic character. Inger Nilsson played Pippi with a big grin on her face and mischievous sparkles in her eyes, but the rather stiff tone of the English voice drags that energy level somewhat down. However, why just 6 parts of the series? I am missing Pippi in the South Sea, fighting pirates, her encounter with the vagabond Rasmus, inventer of the superglue that enables her to walk on walls and ceilings, and not to forget the scenes where Pippi converts a bike into a flying device.

1809300,4,B00007G1VV,"Pippi Longstocking aired as a Swedish TV show in the late 60's. It was a 13 EPISODE series.  Each episode was about 26 minutes long putting the total running time at 340 minutes. ALL 13 of these episodes are currently available in Sweden in a collection of SIX DVDs (but only in Scandinavian without English subtitles).

This DVD is ONLY 6 episodes of the full 13 Episode series, so do not be fooled into thinking you are getting the ""complete"" series in this 160 minute long DVD.

Like many, I have always been bothered by the dubbing in these films, and I have the same problem with this release. However, I have seen the original Swedish language version and that too is dubbed. Like many European films, it does not appear that this show was filmed using ANY natural sound.  Since even the orginal Swedish version has awkward dubbing, I would not worry too much about the awkward English dubbing in this release.  There simply is no version of this show that features a non-dubbed voice track. Still for the sake of the MANY MANY recently immigrated Swedish-Americans it is an absolute shame that Hen's Tooth did not provide the Swedish language track as an option.",1108425600,11,1169,4.655339805825243
1809301,1,B00007G1VV,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY USED PROPER ENGLISH ACCENTS FOR THE VOICE OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING! And they didn't even use the same English words in most parts. I was looking forward to my daughter being able to enjoy these movies like I did growing up. I was SO disappointed. Someone in America needs to redo this set and offer English subtitles or put the ORIGINAL dubbing BACK IN. (Don't get me wrong , I have NOTHING against the British. I LOVE Britain. It just doesn't work for Pippi.) I will stick with my grainy disintegrating VHS tapes. All I can say is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!",1105401600,23,573,4.627450980392157

So, I HATE SUCH ARTIFICIAL things.. we in many european countries were always used to read subtitles, from very young age and hearing i.e. John Wayne with some straneg german or italian language...c`mon...never. And same with this amazing little lady.
But to be even worse....it`s not possible to get original series with any kind of subtitles as the ALindgren foundation SOLD the rights oround the world...and the result is here. I thenk the author is rolling in her grave and would NEVER let this happen. SHAME on money, greed and lack of appriciation for the original. Normal fans can`t stand this. DON`T BUY.",1480550400,2,855,4.903448275862069
