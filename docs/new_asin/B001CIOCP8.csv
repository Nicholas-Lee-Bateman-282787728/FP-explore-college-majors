I found the episodes on Utah and the Mystery Dinosaur very interesting. There are just so many good episodes from Discovery on this set.

3513405,5,B001CIOCP8,"Where as the BBC series ""Walking with Dinosaurs"",(also including ""Chased by Dinosaurs"", ""Walking with Monsters"" and ""Allosaurus"", nicely takes us right there amongst these glorious beasts,(many amazingly convincing and lifelike), the ""Discovery Essential Dinosaur Pack"" brings us neatly back to the present so we can understand the ""study"" of dinosaurs.
 Therefore, not only do we get to see even more ""convincing"" dinosaurs rampaging all over the place,(don't worry, there's plenty!), we also get a great deal of scientific ""hands on"" documentary insight from many of the best known paleontologists around, as well as plenty of step by step analysis and documentation.
This goes perfectly with the BBC series.",1252195200,43,710,5.574074074074074

Raptors, fossils and birds, this is a wonderful peek into dinosaurs and how we see them.",1226188800,74,568,4.76530612244898

3513457,4,B001CIOCP8,"This is a must for any dinosaur lovers out there.  My son is obsessed with dinosaurs and absolutely loves this set.  The only criticism that my son (who is four) had about these DVDs is that they do not have a wide variety of dinosaurs.  Also, those who are fans of Dr. Scott Sampson (from Dinosaur Train) will appreciate his contribution to the Velociraptor segment.",1437696000,,367,4.615384615384615

3513459,5,B001CIOCP8,"Fantastic I loved it when it was given to me a long time ago and still love it now. But one thing concerning the program Dinosaur planet, when it was released on TV in 2004 or some year around that I was pretty young at the age of 4 or so, before this I had watched walking with dinosaurs for at least one or two year before this and I had no problems with the program. And I also didn't have a problem with this. My suggestion is not too ""sugar coat"" biology and science, because honestly it will help in the long term, because fact is fact no matter what you think.",1436659200,,567,4.0265486725663715
3513470,5,B001CIOCP8,"This is a very enjoyable series. I've gotten through one disk and I'll be sad when I finish the 2nd.  This is much more interesting and enjoyable for adults than the ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" series (which is excellent for younger viewers). I really appreciate the way the science is presented in this series, very succinctly and understandably with uncertainty and different points of view.  Was T. Rex more of a vulture-like scavenger? Jack Horner thinks so. Others see it differently. I guess what makes it so fun to watch is that it's presented as an ongoing unraveling of the secrets of the Mesozoic era.  The digital animations are excellent.  This is a science documentary at its best. ADDENDUM: Finished Disk 2. equally delighted. I especially liked the segment on re-creating living dinosaurs.  Real scientists don't like to go too far out on a limb with speculation, so it was grounded in reality but still spoke to the unbelievably cool concept of a real Jurassic Park.",1436400000,3,979,4.909090909090909
3513471,5,B001CIOCP8,"This is the best Dinosaur DVD of all. We (my grandchildren) and I love the Dinosaur planet (four episodes.) You will fall in love with Whitetip and his friends and foes ... a great moving story. Alpha's egg, is a suspenseful story which follows an egg from beginning to end. Fabulously informative and will hold the little ones' attention. Our favorite is the story of Pod's Travels. Pod is a very smart raptor ... this story showcases his life when he survives an epic sunami, and loses his entire pack ... finds a new pack ... and struggles to survive by his wits alone. You will fall in love with Pod. It ends with the story of Little Das (a baby Daspletosaurus ) as he learns to hunt for his life. These dinosaurs take on bigger than life personalities, and your children and grandchildren will watch them spellbound, and will ask to watch them over and over. These are my favorite dinosaur stories of all time, and as an added bonus, they are narrated by Christian Slater.",1435968000,,977,4.52542372881356

Now that she's getting older,  I wanted to get her more educational,  instructional videos rather than cartoony ones.  This fit the bill!

3513513,5,B001CIOCP8,My son is 3 and loves anything that has to do with REAL dinosaurs. He will not watch anything that is cartoon or doesn't catch his eye! He loves this DVD pack and it was an awesome price!,1422403200,,187,3.9473684210526314
3513514,4,B001CIOCP8,"This set is very enjoyable, and very educational.  Well worth it if you have a real interest in dinosaurs.  I would not recommend this for the younger child unless and until they are interested in the listening to the science of paleontology because there's a lot of it.  My four year old just wants to see big and little beasts doing what they did and he's not so interested in watching people who talk about what they did.  There's also a bit of graphic killing and eating which might upset some little ones.  I didn't find it as good as the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" series by the BBC, but still very good.  If you, or whomever you might be buying these for, is more interested in seeing beasts roaming the wilds, thanseeing where their bones were discovered and how they are excavated, this might not be the best option. My four year old loves wacthing the story of Big Al in the BBC series because it's all dinosaurs roaming and roaring with narration over it. This series spends too much time watching people dig and dust and talk about  dinosaurs to keep my young one's attention. I however got caught up in them and watched while he amused himself with his dinosaur toys.",1421539200,,1178,4.502347417840376

3513516,4,B001CIOCP8,A lot of good dino information in this - interpreted by scientists.  Be prepared for a typical Discovery Channel production with a LOT of repetition.  Gotta be patient.  Good for kids interested in a bit more about dino anatomy and physiology then they might get in class.,1416960000,,272,4.74468085106383

3513526,5,B001CIOCP8,I bought this because I love dinosaur movies and this one is incredibly interesting.  Even my great-granddaughter (who is 6) was enthralled while watching it.  She will pull it out of all my DVD's to watch when she is here.  Very informative and fun to watch.  The different dinosaurs really come to life for you.,1399075200,,313,4.636363636363637

3513530,5,B001CIOCP8,"I loved these shows when they first came on, and I love them still. Unlike other dinosaur shows, these aren't boring -- they're a good combination of story and information, and the person explaining the science behind their footage does so in a way that doesn't make people fall asleep. If you love dinosaurs, but hate watching slow-paced lectures, this is for you. It is well animated for it's time and the information it has is up to date (from what it was made). I enjoyed these shows, and I hope you do, too!",1393891200,,512,4.457446808510638
3513531,4,B001CIOCP8,"I bought this as a Christmas present because my grandson's, aged 2 and 4, love dinosaurs. The animations are wonderful but the boys are too young yet to really appreciate the science that is embedded within the DVDs. But I believe that they will continue to enjoy these DVDs for years to come. I think that this series will allow them to appreciate the science as they continue to mature.",1391644800,,388,4.557142857142857

ALl my children are very interested in Dinosaurs and this is a great informative video with realistic reanimation of prehistoric beasts! My kids have taught me so much about dinosaurs since my buying this video set!!!

It is very long,  doesn't address dinosaur facts appropriate for children, and it describes in detail the mating process which is something you may not want to explain to a young child.  I bought it because reviews said it was good for kids, I have to wonder if the adults actually watched this before letting kids watch it.  Much more appropriate for jhs and up age.",1383436800,8,430,4.3375

3513568,5,B001CIOCP8,"480 minutes of dagger-toothed dino, three-toed theropod fun. This is a great buy for dinophiles, and even if you have an average interest in dinosaurs.

A lot has changed in paleontology since I was a kid and its great to catch up on the big debates. These DVD's help you do that.

The one John Goodman narrates has some wonderful production values. Some of the episodes are better produced than others, but for the price and content,  this viewer is happier than a velociraptor in a henhouse.

3513576,5,B001CIOCP8,"This has a collection of superb information about dinosaurs, including National geographic, and the four episodes that were made about dinosaurs. This is really everything the dinosaur fan could want, sent in GREAT time and overall, VERY GOOD!!",1375574400,,244,5.447368421052632
3513577,4,B001CIOCP8,"Two videos packed with information (although a little too advanced at this point for my grandchildren), but they love the video stories and I think this will be around for a long time in my house.",1375315200,,196,4.472222222222222
3513578,5,B001CIOCP8,"My 4 year old is obsessed with dinosaurs, history and all that sort of stuff. (Odd I know) She has nothing to do with dinosaur train, she would rather watch this documentary over and over again. I found it to be fun and informative.",1374537600,,232,4.295454545454546
3513579,3,B001CIOCP8,"The various episodes re-use the same footage from other discovery episodes with different voice overs.
Overall, it was good.
Some of the CGI lacked a little bit, but overall it was worth the money.",1374105600,,197,4.823529411764706
3513580,3,B001CIOCP8,"But a decent one.  The title is deceiving.  Its all previous stuff.  But at the price, its worth having if you don't already have the shows under other titles.  I did, but its still good for a long night of escaping bad regular TV to see about dinosaurs.",1373673600,,254,4.229166666666667

3513584,5,B001CIOCP8,"Ordered this May 9 and it was priced at $8 and now a month later it's a dollar less -- ORDER this ASAP. Worth every penny. Incredible collection with lots of great information and CGI to depict how dinosaurs may have interacted. Our kids love the movie Land Before Time but the story is too sad to watch very often. The anthropomorphism seems to affect their experience. Whereas this dvd attempts a more realistic depiction and even with fatal moments (bloody carnivores, sudden fatalities) our children absolutely love this collection.",1370304000,,536,4.966666666666667
3513585,4,B001CIOCP8,I purchased this DVD set as a gift for a dino enthusiastic 6 year old charge. He loves many of the programs but fair warning to anyone looking to buy these for the child; some of the programs are very technical and while I found them very interesting he was bored.,1369094400,,264,4.196078431372549
3513586,4,B001CIOCP8,I can no longer watch anything else. my son insists that we watch dinosaurs. :/ lol great for children to learn.,1367366400,,112,4.380952380952381

3513589,5,B001CIOCP8,I ordered this dvd after searching through several for this dinosaur phase I'm in and I must say at first this kind of was a snooze to watch but after giving it a full chance I'm happy to have ordered. It's very informational and entertaining,1361059200,,242,4.4
3513590,5,B001CIOCP8,"My son loves Amazone.com... ""The best website in the world, because it has so many Dinosaurs DVD!"" He says... :0)",1358812800,,113,4.7
3513591,2,B001CIOCP8,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was so excited until we got to the second disc and it didn't work. The poor boy was crying and very upset. I can't return it cause i don't own a printer to print out the labels to ship it back. I will not buy from here again.,1358208000,,271,3.689655172413793
3513592,5,B001CIOCP8,This is a fantastic DVD collection. It goes over several different ideas and deals with a lot of good information. I am very pleased with this set. If you or someone you know likes dinosaurs this is a must. It is great for the whole family to watch.,1357948800,,249,4.208333333333333
3513593,5,B001CIOCP8,Perfect movie if you are a dinosaur lover.  Some of parts in video are a little draggy but informative.  Better movie for younger viewer,1357344000,,136,4.625
3513594,5,B001CIOCP8,3 year old grandson has watched them all repeatedly; but has selected a few that he want to repeatedly watch certain ones. If you have a dinosaur addict they will love this.,1356825600,2,173,4.4375

3513596,3,B001CIOCP8,As with the other 2 films I reviewed earlier; the film was only okay. I have many such films and consider that not a lot of difference existed between the films even though the presentations were somewhat different from one another. Still if you don't have a large collection of these films they are all well worth getting. I did and I'm glad I did. If you have kids they could learn a lot from these films.,1353369600,2,407,4.298701298701299
3513597,4,B001CIOCP8,Interesting new info. Visually impressive. My only complaint: too many people and not enough dinosaurs. My little ones get bored with it for this reason but will appreciate more later I'm sure.,1351728000,,193,5.0625
3513598,4,B001CIOCP8,"I hope I don't get blasted for this review, but wanted to warn parents of very young dinosaur enthusiasts that these DVDs may be too graphic for them.  I bought this pack due to all of the great reviews, and I don't regret the purchase.  However, I do regret not viewing it first, before I started showing it to my almost 3-year-old son.  I started showing him Dinosaur Planet, as I had read in another review that Dr. Scott (from Dinosaur Train) was featured in the show.  The first Dinosaur Planet episode features a Velociraptor  named White Tip whose pack is killed.  There are several very graphic scenes of predators killing and eating other dinosaurs.  We had to turn off the video after a particularly scary (for a 3 year old) scene.  My son has seen all of the episodes of Walking with Dinosaurs and Chased by Dinosaurs & he was not disturbed by any of the scenes in those shows.

I think the computer animation and stories on these DVDs are pretty good.  I will be holding on to this and showing it to my son in a few years, when he is ready.  Again, just to be clear, I am not blaming anyone but myself for not screening this ahead, but know that there are probably other busy moms and dads out there that could make the same mistake and want to give them a heads up.",1346544000,95,1278,4.305439330543933
3513599,4,B001CIOCP8,"I purchased this DVD to pop in on rainy days and times when I need my boys to sit down for a few minutes. The collection is excellent and I get asked to watch it all the time. If you are looking for something to show the kids interested in dinosaurs this is it. My three-year-old loves the Dinosaur Planet series with Dr. Scott, The Paleontologist, who is now on Dinosaur Train. The price was perfect as well.",1337385600,,409,4.256410256410256
3513600,5,B001CIOCP8,I got this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it and it's the only movie he ever wants to watch.  I like the fact that it is entertaining as well as informative.,1328400000,,184,3.945945945945946
3513601,5,B001CIOCP8,"Let me start by saying when I was a child I loved dinosaurs but way back then (lol) it really wasn't popular so a had a few books I read over and over.  I have children now and we don't watch mainstream tv.  The shows on tv are horrible leading parents to believe they are educational, it's and insult children deserve better!  So I spend a lot of money on DVDs.  My son is only two so I bought this for myself and for him in the future, so I thought.  He started watching one with me and he was hooked he sat and watched an entire episode then asked for more. I was nervous it was to graphic for a young mind but he didn't seem bothered.  We now have watched all the episodes and are very pleased with the purchase.  In my opinion it is graphic but tastefully done so if your young one frightens easy it's not for you. Hope this helps",1325203200,2,835,4.024242424242424
3513602,5,B001CIOCP8,"I haven't purchased this for one reason, I already have When Dinosaurs Roamed North America and don't want to get it again.  Outside of that I would suggest this to anyone who has a great interest in dinosaurs.  Additionally, I would suggest Walking With Dinosaurs and Clash of the Dinosaurs.

On a different note, I don't understand why they do not have Dinosaur Planet, which is included in this 2 disc DVD pack, is not in its own package.  A year or so ago I could recall seeing the 4 part series Dinosaur Planet in stores like Best Buy and now I can't find it online anywhere.",1297641600,2,580,4.392523364485982
3513603,5,B001CIOCP8,"The four episodes of ""Dinosaur Planet"" are just the best thing I have seen of its kind.  My grandson loves them and they do indeed fit very well with the BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs.  Highly recommended.",1296691200,3,209,4.621621621621622
3513604,5,B001CIOCP8,"After purchasing this set, I think I'm good on dinosaur documentaries for the next decade. I bought it for my son - who is obsessed with dinosaurs - and he must have watched it at least ten times over the first week. It is very informative; so much so that I even learned a few new things. On top of that, it is very entertaining to watch the 3-D recreations of all the different types of dinosaurs, especially the Velociraptors (my son's personal favorite). If you enjoy learning about dinosaurs, or you have a child that loves them, I highly recommend this documentary.",1292025600,2,571,4.553398058252427
3513605,5,B001CIOCP8,"First, I grew up with a paleontologist, so I have a great deal of respect for this series of documentaries. If you are looking for something scientifically credible but fun too, this is the set. Second, I have a 9 year old son who is autistic and ""obsessed"" with dinosaurs. He usually has a hard time staying still for any length of time, but he will watch this entire collection in one day without moving from the couch. Not only that, but he is learning a great deal and asking questions that come from the material he watches for me to look up. We own just about every dinosaur book and video out there, and this is the best one that we have found so far.",1291420800,15,658,4.23015873015873
3513606,3,B001CIOCP8,its pretty good and has alot of good information. though some of the shows are abit biased. the graphics at times suck but considering some of the shows are afew years old its understandable. in all its pretty good though i believe it could have been better.,1282694400,2,258,4.51063829787234
3513607,5,B001CIOCP8,"We ordered this for my then 5 year old son.  I thought he would have to grow into it a bit, but he LOVED it from day one.

I would encourage this video series for any serious dinosaur lover.",1271462400,11,312,4.166666666666667

3513612,4,B001CIOCP8,"The essential dinosaur pack is very well done with a lot of science explained (especially in the creating a dinosaur episode). However, the one point that I found a little odd was that the graphics were not what I was expecting. After watching Jurassic Park and especially the 'Walking With' series from the BBC, the graphics and lack of constant interaction with their environment made the dinosaurs depicted look at times like cartoons, not the realistic creatures I was expecting. A good series, and well worth it, especially with so much on the 2 discs, but could have been better.",1260489600,17,585,4.86
