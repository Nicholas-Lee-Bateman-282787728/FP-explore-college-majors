7850055,4,6303536166,"This christmas special is probably one of the best for really young kids.  Its short and sweet, about teddy bears that don't want their kids to wake up on christmas morning and have no christmas,  so they set off on an adventure where they meet new friends, and try to find a christmas tree. It has a magical quality that lots of kids will love (the teddy bears coming to life) and also alot of kids can relate to (will Santa be able to find us, what if there are real bears outside). Some parents might not want to watch this over and over,  as some of the voices can get kind of annoying.  I hope f.h.e. will release this on DVD, maybe a double feature with Nick and Noel.",1038268800,,674,4.161538461538462

We rented it twice and she was so upset about returning it the second time that we decided to purchase it.  It is a nice, sweet, magical story about Christmas.  It is the perfect length, about 30 minutes or so, and sends a good message about faith and hope.",972259200,,344,4.181818181818182
