4258232,5,B0043WC6PI,I really enjoyed this DVD on the TI 89 calculator.  The explanations of the various modes of the calculator are presented by the use of an animation of the calculator.  You can work along with your Ti89 and get used to various menus.  I find it much easier than trying to read the manual. I highly recommend this DVD.,1315094400,,317,4.338983050847458
4258233,3,B0043WC6PI,"Anything by Mathtutordvd will be sure to please but
in this case I am asking that the company put the
ENTIRE course on Amazon.

Specifically, This TI-89 Tutor is a two volume set
but you can only order vol. I on Amazon. Vol. II must
come from mathtutordvd.com. Why is that a problem?
Because you are charged $9.99US minimum for shipping.
Yikes!

The price for the dvds is the same for either site but
10 bucks to ship a $27 dvd is not right. If Jason can
afford to ship for free off Amazon than please put up
Vol II. All their stuff is so great.

Here's Hoping.",1306540800,3,561,4.175925925925926
4258234,5,B0043WC6PI,I really enjoy math tutor DVD's. I probably own around 8 different videos from them. I definetly recommend giving them a try!,1294185600,,125,4.7272727272727275
8415351,5,B0043WC6PI,I needed this Video to help me understand the TI-89 in greater depth. It is still a big help to me.,1469577600,,99,3.761904761904762
8415352,1,B0043WC6PI,"Never should of purchase this product, it would be ok if you have a TI89 calculator instead of a TI83",1443571200,,101,4.1
8415353,4,B0043WC6PI,"Like all of Jason's dvds this and part 2 are excellent for what he says it does, step by step ,walks you through it all.and that is why I recommend anything by Jason, it makes math easier to learn by simple repetition. And you will get the math,you will understand the math,I mean it! But these 2 DVD sets don't cover half of what this calculator does ! I inadvertently screwed up and deleated parts of the statistics applications, if you have a computer download the free ti apps,and get a backup ,this will let you put the app's back on the device. I wish I had gibsons dvds before I experimented with the calculator. I hope he does a third part covering the stuff left out in parts 1 and 2,let's see ti89 part 3 !",1442966400,,716,4.233576642335766
8415354,5,B0043WC6PI,Math Tutor DVDs are great.,1440201600,,26,4.4
8415355,5,B0043WC6PI,The delivery is so smooth and the DVD is really helping me out.~,1418860800,,64,4.0
8415356,5,B0043WC6PI,This is a great way to learn how to fully use this calculator. I can highly recommend all the MathTutor products for high school and first year college math students. (Those are the DVDs I have actually watched and studied; I use it together with the Great Courses lectures on math.),1412467200,,283,4.568627450980392
8415357,5,B0043WC6PI,"Jason is very clear and repeats when the going gets difficult.  You can either sit and listen or work along with him.  The two volumes together make an excellent coverage of how to use the ti-89, which is the most difficult calculator to learn to use I have ever come across, with an official manual that is very far from clear.  There are all kinds of tips and tricks that you wouldn't find without these tutorials.
I have one caveat.  Instructions for programming it are not included.  Given how much the calculator can do there may have been an assumption that this is not necessary.  At university level maths I need to be able to do my own thing.  Please, Jason, write volume 3!",1377302400,,683,4.459677419354839
8415358,5,B0043WC6PI,For me being a hands on person watching this video is so much better than trying to figure out written instructions. Very clear and easy to follow! Excited to get started on learning not only this calculator but for my next math class. Then the other possibilties of down loading updated information. Thank you again for making life easier for me.,1371686400,,347,4.704918032786885
8415359,5,B0043WC6PI,"These videos cover, item by item, most of what this calculator can do. Without tutorials like these I suspect that most math students are sitting down at exams not fully using the power of this calculator and thus not getting the highest marks. The videos are clear and nicely broken down so that each segment covers a single topic or closely related group of topics; thus making it easier to skip what you do know.
My use of the calculator prior to watching these videos was like having a car and not knowing that it had back seats, a trunk, or that the windows rolled down.
Many thanks to the author.",1335744000,,602,4.4324324324324325
8415360,5,B0043WC6PI,"This is a great tool to quickly learn the ins and outs of the TI89.  I have the Titanium but this will work even for the plain old TI89.  Yes, you can read the manual and use TI's online resources but who has time for that?  If you are going to be using this for Calculus including differential equations etc this is the fastest way to get the most out of your device.  Excellent tool.  Another home run by MathTutorDVD.

NOTE:
Some of the lettering on the video showing the calculator screens seems hazy.  This is NOT because the video or its production is bad but because the screen resolution on the TI89 is abysmal.  In fact there are many complaints, especially by older folks like myself, who find reading the TI89 menus a royal pain.  But because the calculator does so much so well and  because TI has a lock on the calculator market the TI89 is used extensively in educational circles.",1318809600,4,894,4.429447852760736
