Those Italians are still behind the moon, considering such a totally harmless scene with more than mild nudity!",1456358400,,252,6.228571428571429

I've give just one star for this dvd not for the movie that it's a very great and beautiful movie of Samperi and it worth have Five stars
but just because the quality of the dvd is awful, colors, pictures not clear, sound,  evertithing is bad.
One month ago I bought the italian dvd of Ernesto with ""Amazon.it"" and the quality is perfect. Remasterized and good colors, good sound and good picture, but unfortunately for you without english subtitles...
It's a pity that the USA's copy of this Dvd it's so bad for a so good movie. I think that a old VHS is better !!! GG",1412899200,2,645,4.286885245901639

8255068,4,B0014CB2UA,"In 1911, young Ernesto (Martin Halm) is rising in his family's warehouse business in Trieste, on the Adriatic coast of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  On the side, Ernesto develops a tender, sexual relationship with one of the laborers (Michele Placido).  Ernesto realizes his unknowing family care about marriage alliances and about appearances.  A class-appropriate opposite-sexed pair of twins (both played by Lara Wendel) arrive in his social cirle.  Although Ernesto likes all three of his friends, how can he arrive at a sustainable future?

The film is nicely made and acted and raises excellent questions.  The sex scenes are suggestive, but restrained.  The skin shots are of Ernesto and the Laborer.

Sadly Criterion has not become involved in sprucing up the eligible, 1979 color picture.  The disc offered is a DVD-R giving a picture of VHS-level sharpness.  The cover art is well doen.  There are no extra features.",1361577600,3,926,5.2312925170068025
8255069,5,B0014CB2UA,"This a great movie gives a better perspective of the bisex lifestyle. I have seen two version. The 1978 has a longer sex scene. I wonder what is in the dvd version and any extras. Right now i can't find the dvd,",1294876800,,211,4.0476190476190474

8255071,4,B0014CB2UA,"While I was viewing the movie, I became increasingly concerned that I was watching a gay coming out film rather than the advertised coming of age video. But, it took a great deal of patience to finally learn what it was about. The film deals with a topic very much like `You're Not Alone' with a different direction.
*The editor's review pretty much tells the plot synopsis very well. I will further add that Ernesto was an attractive and desirable young man to both sexes. He was experiencing uncertainty about his orientation during his period of discovery. A gay man, his heterosexual friends, and family pressure were factors that led to his decision at the end.
*His decision was further complicated when he met a teen boy who had an identical twin sister who had the same attraction to him as her brother. Ernesto was torn between the two attractive choices.
*This film would have received 5 stars from me if it weren't for two factors. The first was that several scenes were drawn out, which I fast-forwarded a few times. But the dialogue kept me interested enough to view it to the end. But that wasn't enough to knock it down a star. The clincher was that the director didn't finish the story to my satisfaction. Some scenes could have been edited out to make time that included a resolution about the other identical twin. That could have made this movie one of the best in this genre.
*WARNING: Some have tagged this movie as having frontal male nudity and nude boys that were not in this video, which I suspect is a marketing tag that panders to the gay community. The only nudity was a bare butt that you see on the cover of the DVD case.",1212192000,14,1651,4.525083612040134
