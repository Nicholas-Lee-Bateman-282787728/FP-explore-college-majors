7938580,5,B00005JCCM,"This video has all of the sickness of tricks mentioned in the other reviews, but it has more that was not mentioned. All snowboard videos have little in-between-parts videos, sometimes with mini-stories. But this vid takes the cake in that department, I was laughing so hard at some of the things they put in this movie, like the T-Bird, or the chainsaw shower scene. I don't want to go into any more detail for fear of ruining it for you. Basically, if you know enough about snowboarding to be looking at this, you should buy it.",1128729600,,530,4.53125

From Todd Richards to Mickey LeBlanc, everyone in this video spents very little time on the snow and a lot of time in the air or on a rail (or two). We're not talking simple trick like straight air with a grab; think Rodeo, CAB, BS720, 50/50 on a tree branch, handrails, etc. Guys go BIG with a capital B, I, and G. This is not really a snowboard video as much as it is a stunt video involving snowboards. Jackie Chan would pay to see stuff like this.
And lastly, a good trick needs a good film crew to capture it. And Whitey is one of the best at doing that. Bottom line, Destroyer will fill up the hungriest freestyle enthusiast.",1025222400,,815,4.230769230769231
