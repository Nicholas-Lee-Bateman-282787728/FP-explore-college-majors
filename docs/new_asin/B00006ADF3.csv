7966038,4,B00006ADF3,"oh, get a life you nuts that expect a lot from our friend bruce.  this is a great bruce labruce film.  this is not as good
as  Skin Flick or Strawberry Reich,  but tony ward is good at his job in the film.  and  this one is also a lot of fun around the edges.",1234396800,,259,3.618181818181818
7966039,4,B00006ADF3,"Perhaps, this is the most realistic movie by Bruce Labruce knowing surely particular LA districts' existence better than too many film viewers worldwide.

Although newly produced DVD by BEYOND Entertainment lasted just 76 min and no extra features advertised on its jacket are being provided in reality, this story of Santa Monica Boulevard hustler and surrounding is worth to watch.",1229990400,,383,5.383333333333334
7966040,1,B00006ADF3,"I have seen bad movies but this is one of the worst, don't waste your time, thank god I had it by a copy from a friend, sorry",1154563200,5,125,3.5
7966041,1,B00006ADF3,Just horrible. Not worth more than a curious peek...then turn it off!,1089504000,9,69,4.833333333333333
7966042,4,B00006ADF3,"Sure the movie is odd, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  The scenes of gang bangs, amputee sex, mummification, among others are not for everyone, but this stuff DOES go on.
Ignore the ""shocking"" moments and you have a fun film with a dark sense of humor.  The acting is sub-par, but that's what goes with this genre (think John Waters, Greg Araki, Larry Clark).  Taken as what it is, it's diverting, amusing, dark and memorable (for better or worse, the images DO stick with you).",1075766400,18,479,4.546511627906977
7966043,2,B00006ADF3,"Very strange movie not unlike the documentary ""Sex/Life in L.A."" with 'actor' Tony Ward as the common link.
Basically a film about a few days in the life of a street hustler (Ward) and some of his colleagues.  Some of the scenes are quite strong especially the amputee bits!! (need I say more).
The 'acting' is interesting especially Bruce La Bruce who plays the camp researcher Juergen Anger.
Somewhere between a porn film and a film about porn.
In summary, I wouldn't advise buying but watch it if you get chance.  You won't know whether to laugh, cry or ....!!",1038355200,5,563,4.62
7966044,1,B00006ADF3,Awful! Doesn't even rise to the level of good camp or kitsch.,1033171200,2,61,4.166666666666667
