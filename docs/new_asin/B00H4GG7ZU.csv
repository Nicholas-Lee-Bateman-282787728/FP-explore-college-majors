8629851,5,B00H4GG7ZU,"I am somewhat new to construction, and found this 2 DVD set to be a great walk-through, end to end, of the building of a conventional house. The DVD does a great job of balancing breadth and depth, and touches on all of the major steps and systems in the house. They do a nice job as well of highlighting the intersections between several of the trades.

If you are considering having a house built, this is a great introduction.",1369612800,,429,4.3625
