8021111,4,B00023BN60,I thought that there was a nice forward narrative.  There were many images.  There was some video footage and a considerable number of audio excerpts.  I thought that this was a nicely done video.  I am not an expert on the history of the British Music Hall but I felt that this video was a credible introduction to this era of British entertainment,1264982400,,349,4.492063492063492
