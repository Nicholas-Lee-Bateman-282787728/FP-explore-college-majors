3438748,1,B0019LY5IC,"A terrible movie, gluttony of exaggerations and overacting. Oliver Stone should be ashamed of his work.",1491868800,,103,5.5
3438749,4,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone is a known anti-Republican so I wasn't expecting this to be an excuse for the presidency.  Josh Brolin as George Bush and Richard Dreyfus as Dick Cheney both give believable renditions. Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell deserves honorable mention but is too young to be a convincing character.

Stone focused on Bush's irresponsible early years as a man who always got bailed out by his ""Poppy.""  His reckless drunk driving, getting a girlfriend pregnant, quitting an oil rig job are all accurate, but I question the tension between father and son.  George Bush suffers from knowing that Jeb is the preferred son who would one day be president, if we were to believe the script, but fate was not on Jeb's side.

The scenes begin with a round table meeting with Bush's advisors after 9/11 and talks of the ""Axis of Evil.""  Colin Powell is not comfortable with including Iran in this Axis (or even Iraq) since neither country attacked us.  Powell gets ignored and eventually he supports Bush because soldiers fall orders.

Then the subsequent scenes skip back to his college days with short scenes from  times in his life, through the 1970s through his time as president after 9/11.  Compelling to me is how Colin Powell is portrayed:  as a clear-thinking, level-headed man who fears another Vietnam if American troops are sent into Iraq.  No one in the cabinet seems to listen to Powell's advice. There's an impressive scene at the 1:20:50 hour mark with Colin Powell talking and then challenging Dick Cheney.  This scene summarizes the Iraq War.  Bush comes across as a narrow-minded tyrant who wants to spread ""freedom and democracy"" across the Middle East.  Colin was in Vietnam but Cheney got several deferments. Well, we all know how that fared.

The quotes by the various characters were at one time spoken by the real people in our history, but Stone took liberty with presenting these quotes in different context.  One sees Bush's reliance on Karl Rove, Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld, although one also sees Bush's disappointment in Rumsfeld shortly after the Iraq War.  One also sees Bush's frustration with how the war played out that first year.

There is a slight slant here against Bush as a confident leader, and the Bush family as thirsting for power.  Brolin portrayed Bush well in speech and mannerism.  Richard Dreyfus didn't have to work too hard to portray Dick Cheney.  Acting overall was good but there were a few choppy scenes that took away from the natural story.  Whether one supported Bush and the Iraq War, one thing that Bush will be given credit for is starting the disaster that has become Iraq today. Watching this movie 14 years after the fact, I wonder where our country would be if either Jeb Bush or Colin Powell had become president instead of Bush.",1491696000,4,2794,4.811320754716981

3438755,3,B0019LY5IC,"This film tries very hard to make some sense of the leader behind our biggest foreign policy mistake since Vietnam. But uneven direction and a mediocre script leaves us with more a caricature than a cast of believable characters. These are able actors, all. Yet some, like Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice, give the worst performances I've ever seen them give. Kudos, though, to Richard Dreyfuss portraying a very believable Dick Cheney without wasting time trying to perform an impression of Cheney.

Yet how can you deliver substance to someone who appears to have none? Nixon was Shakespearean by being an able person with immense capacities and potential, undone by demons acquired over a very long political career. Same with LBJ. But with W you're left with the haunting feeling of there being ""no there, there."" Plus there is little evidence that he ever was capable of grasping his failures. There's the White House Correspondents Dinner where he attempted the most feeble of jokes about the failure to find WMDs in Iraq. And now, on his recent book tour, he tries to joke about Mission Accomplished. Meanwhile an entire region of the world remains on fire, its victims flooding the Middle East and Europe, or perishing in their attempt to find safety. And the so-called good war in Afghanistan enters its 15th year with no end in sight.

Perhaps there is no possible portrayal of this president that can deliver any true or satisfying sense of meaning. Yet our national penchant for electing chief executives lacking even the rudiments of the fundamental cerebral capacity the job demands remains.",1490745600,2,1608,4.996268656716418

It gives an entertaining and hilarious look at the personal life of George W. before he was elected president, as well as the lackluster and almost reluctant way in which he governs. The director's message makes it clear that George W. wanted more to be admired and revered by his father, George Sr., more than he wanted to govern as president.

3438771,5,B0019LY5IC,"W. is a biographical film of President George W. Bush.  The earlier parts of the film disclose Mr. Bush's life in college, and his early explorations in career-direction.

OPENING SEQUENCES.  The film opens with the sound of a woman singing the national anthem, then we hear sounds of a cheering baseball crowd, and then to this is added the sound of a typical stadium organ.  The visual part of the movie starts, and we see actor Josh Brolin standing in an empty baseball stadium raising his arms, acknowledging the applause (the applause is only on the soundtrack, and the stadium is completely empty).  The stadium announcer says, ""And now ladies and gentlemen, the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush.""  Then, without any transition, the next scene shows a conference in the White House.  Mr. Bush is conferring with his cabinet members.

Mr. Bush: ""Axis of hatred?
Young adviser: ""Something about it just misses.""
Another adviser: ""What about Axis of Weasels?""
Mr. Bush scolds the adviser: ""Don't get cute Carl!""
Another adviser: ""I think it needs to be stronger.  We need something to cut through the noise.  Stronger, like President Reagan's Evil Empire speech.""
Young adviser: ""What about Axis of Evil?""
Mr. Bush: ""Axis of Evil!  Yah, I like the ring of it.  It's good!""
Colin Powell: ""Mr. President, Axis brings us World War II.  You can't link Germany and Japan with Iraq and North Korea.""
Another adviser, agreeing with the term Axis of Evil:  ""Weapons of mass destruction makes these countries more dangerous.  We've got to begin educating the American public about the size of this war and its implications . . . the American public wants revenge.""

OTHER EARLY SEQUENCES.  The portion of the movie showing college life shows a rowdy drinking contest by college boys, is excellent.  As part of this contest, you are required to name as many as possible of the boys in the drinking party.  A fat boy is only able to name a few, but Mr. Bush recites an entire string of names, including their nick names.  When Bush recites all of these names, he is lauded for his intelligence.  Another early scene shows Mr. Bush taking a hands-on blue-color job in an oil rig.  However, he does not like the job, and he quits.

IMPERSONATORS.  Much of the movie takes the form of conferences with executives in the U.S. government, including Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice.  One of the conferences takes place in a rural meadow in Texas.  Other conferences take place in the White House.  What I liked most about this movie, were the parts of this movie showing actors playing these executives.  The resemblances between the actors and their real-life counterparts was amazing!  This movie is worthy of repeated viewings, mostly because of the startling and convincing parts showing the actors playing Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice.

PSYCHOLOGY.  A recurring theme in this movie are the psychological aspects of Mr. Bush.  One of these themes, is Mr. Bush's interest in baseball, and his very early interest in becoming a baseball player.  The film discloses that Mr. Bush has recurring nightmares of playing the outfield position in a baseball park, where the ball never comes his way, and where the grandstands are totally empty of spectators.  Another recurring psychological theme are scenes where Mr. Bush's father (George Herbert Walker Bush) scolds him for being incompetent.  The father is played by James Cromwell, an actor who starred in the delightful movie (Babe) about a pig.  One of Mr. Bush's nightmares shows an episode of scolding from the father.

STUPIDITY.  The perception that Mr. Bush is a stupid man is common in America, but the film does not dwell much on this fact and does not make fun of Mr. Bush for his stupidity.  As most people know, Mr. Bush has problems speaking English -- his grammar is bad and he stutters.  But the script in this movie only includes very subtle examples of bad grammar or stuttering. Towards the end of this movie, the viewer is treated to a scene where Mr. Bush is dramatically shown to be unable to think on his feet, in response to a simple question during a meeting from the press.  In fact, Mr. Bush repeatedly gives excuses for and apologizes for his inability to answer the simple question.  An amusing example of stupidity, is when Mr. Bush confuses the place name ""Guantanamo"" with the song name, ""Guantanamera.""  When Bush says ""Guantanamera,"" a government official quickly corrects him, saying ""Guantanamo.""  Only baby-boomers will understand this joke, because ""Guantanamera"" was a song on the rock'n'roll charts in the year 1966. Also parts of this movie show that Mr. Bush has trailer-trash behavior patterns, in addition to showing his use of bad grammar.

CONCLUSION.  Despite the fact that most actors have little or no experience playing upper echelon executives in the United States government, or in playing red-neck trailer trash at beer-drenched Texas barbecue parties, all of the acting was convincing and totally stellar. Now, here is the main reason I picked up this movie from the local library --- an opinion shared by some Americans, is that the Republican candidate in the 2016 election is the weirdest and most disgusting, most repugnant, most putrid, most incompetent scum-dog-doo persons, ever to run for political office in the history of the United States, not to mention his absolute lack of experience in politics.  Over the course of the summer of 2016, the continual media coverage of the hotel-weirdo has caused me continual annoyance, in the same way that a vicious barking doberman or a vicious barking rottweiler in a neighbor's yard, would cause annoyance.  And so, the materialization of the hotel-weirdo as a media-event, has made me much more appreciative of Mr. George W. Bush.",1477612800,2,5861,4.963076923076923
3438772,5,B0019LY5IC,"I Didn't Think It Was Possible to feel a kind of sympathy for George W. Bush. Like Oliver Stone I believe the Iraq War was unjust. Phase 1 of that war under Poppy Bush (the father) and phase 2 under the son yielded a horrific toll in human lives, hundreds of thousands dead and dying to this very day. Moreover it opened the gates of hell in the Middle East which the United States and Israel have exploited or directly caused with a view to reconfiguring that most incendiary region of the world.

But it was not until last night that I finally got around to watching Oliver Stone's remarkably nuanced 2008 film starring Josh Brolin. Stone opened a window to the complex human side of the man known to his friends as simply 'W' which is also the name of the film.

In it Stone presents a man struggling to both please and appease his formidably accomplished (even if mysterious) father and to overcome his own personal weaknesses: alcohol, women, and an expectation of ineptitude that seemed to follow him all his silver-spooned life. A man who knew that considering the first quarter or more of his life even his family didn't expect much of him. For them it was always the more thoughtful brother, Jeb, who was the heir apparent.

'W' as Stone portrays him believes in a mixed jumble of simple American values and clichs: Freedom, Independence, the opportunity to go from little to a lot, the American Dream...

 Couple all this with a desire to prove he was not the charming flunky everybody thought he was and one can't help but sympathize with his determination to rise against the odds.

And, as I said, I found myself unexpectedly sympathizing with that effort. Stone clearly wanted to create a genuine picture of a whole, even if naive (but not wicked) man.

One of the reasons 'W' decided to go from an 80% approval rating in the polls after the horror of 9/11, and after initiating retaliation in Afghanistan, to a full blown war on Iraq, had to do with that long shadow of his father who after the First Gulf War failed to go all the way to Baghdad to arrest or kill Saddam Hussein. 'W' believed that that was part of what cost the old man his bid for reelection. And 'W' also believed the Intelligence reports that said the Iraqis had hatched a plot to actually assassinate his father.

These things alone had him itching to finish the job that his father didn't. It was a way of avenging his father's losses; and a way of showing his father that he, not Jeb, would be the most honorable son.

But, as mentioned, 'W' was notoriously naive, as well as simple, in his assessment of facts. And so he was easy prey for the shrewder Neocons in his cabinet (read: Dick Cheney) who were out to avenge not only the 'failures' of the First Gulf War but also the Vietnam Syndrome which Cheney and his fellow Neocons viewed was dishonorable weakness.

So even if there was only a ""one percent chance"" as Cheney reportedly said that Saddam had and was hiding Weapons of Mass Destruction that was good enough pretext to launch the biggest mistake or crime of the century. 'W' would like to have had more proof, but settled for the dubious ""proofs"" the Neocons proffered, proofs that Colin Powell presented to the world at the United Nations.

And the rest is ongoing bloody history.

'W' was left bewildered when no WMDs were found and when the NeoCon Cheney only shrugged. The last shot of the film tells it all. But I won't give that away.

This film is worth watching for latecomers like myself. Oliver Stone is a serious man, even if his nasty Establishment critics (and cynical jingoists) will never make that concession. See the film and decide for yourself. It is said that when President Bush saw the film he thought it wasn't too bad. ---Culture, Arts and Trends",1476230400,,3771,4.552437223042836

I served in the military under U.S. President Bush and served in Iraq and nothing in this comedy is accurate or realistic in any way.  It is just a silly attempt to push a conspiracy theorists ideology onto unsuspecting Americans. The movie is funny and Josh Brolin does an INCREDIBLE job acting and conveying a thought through facial and body expressions. During the entire movie I could not help but feel sorry for Oliver Stonehe did such a GREAT job with JFK and inspiring his conspiracy followers but his lack of facts, reality and human nature for the character and person of G.W. Bush is so insufficient that I laughed even during Stone's attempts of heartfelt moments. This movie was plain ridiculous and now perhaps Oliver Stone should consider resigning his citizenship and go back to the hypothetical planet that he obviously hails from.

3438930,3,B0019LY5IC,The movie was interesting and it kept my attention  .I found the portrayal of G.W. in places overcharged especially in the college hazing scenes and in the relationship with his father. W.  never seemed to accept his own responsability for his decisions  and actions  always turning the blame onto others. On the whole he is presented  in an unfavorable manner. I would have preferred  a more documentary approach with clearer  indication of the sources of information. The ending of the movie  is unsatisfying in lack of explanation of the turmoil  in Irac after the fall of Sadam Houssein.  Three stars  is all I could give this movie.

I have enjoyed watching this movie going on three times, now, and I will probably watch it several times more, which is a process that I find I have to employ for every movie in Mr. Stone's library of films.  No problem.  Josh Brolin is absolutely stellar in  his interpretation of W.'s character.  Throughout the movie, I sometimes get the feeling that I'm looking at the actual man, George W. Bush.  The impression I have is that the complexity of W.'s real involvement in world events is somehow explained. Most people will find this movie as, ""Just like any other movie made by Oliver Stone.""  But, what's wrong with that?  Check it out.  It's at least entertaining , and at best  a very interesting enlightenment on the root reasons for, ""...why Iraq?""",1467331200,,992,4.88622754491018

All the drinking and hell raising didn't sit well with his father who always favored Jeb to be the future President.  But, G W was a lot more likable than Jeb and after he met Laura and quit drinking his rise to power was on the fast track.  The movie really shows how much influence Karl Rove and Dick Cheney had with the President.  The backroom politics that Rove and Cheney maneuvered to give Bush a reason to invade Iraq was dealt with fairly and also how his father was against it.  Bush the elder explained why he didn't invade Iraq after kicking them  out of Kuwait.  His son should have listened.  This movie doesn't deal with other aspects of the Bush presidency like the Great Recession and what caused it.",1467331200,,883,4.368098159509202

I would recommend watching as many people struggled to historically understand the reason we went to war with Iraq after 911, and it paints a very accurate image of the rationale and spin that was used to try to accomplish the bush administration goals.",1467244800,,791,4.538461538461538

He was not perfect, because he is human and every President has made mistakes.  But one thing I am certain about is President George W. Bush loved this country and always had the best intentions, in my opinion.  So, I will definitely plan to watch this movie.

For example, the script for Cheney would have us believe that he was only just a little more than a passive bystander. The viewer is led to believe that this mad inferno of a bloodbath without end in Afghanistan and Iraq began as little more than a Bush family vendetta against Saddam Hussein.

The Iraqi military was the third largest in the world at the time and had been measured well by the intelligence apparatus. The devastating defeat of that formidable force through Shock and Awe proved to the world that the US was indeed, by far, still No. 1... and THAT was the geopolitical upside. It's psychological and strategic importance will never be exactly known, but pressure coming from the intelligence community to make it happen trumped everything else.

Stone's portrayal of George W. is negatively stereotypical and demonstrated little to no genuine understanding of Texas culture nor of the Christian right for that matter.  Some of it I liked.  As a Vietnam vet I was appalled to see President Bush land on an aircraft carrier dressed as a pilot, as though he was just another one of those fighting in the air.  He wasn't, of course, and I was offended.  Certainly,  anyone who has seen actual combat knows that there is nothing glorious about it.  War is an evil business regardless of what side you're on. I was glad to see  that episode included in the film because when I saw the original landing, I thought, ""What an idiot.  He has no idea what war is really about for those who fight.""  But I don't think many Americans do either.  Today, we rely on volunteers to do our fighting for us and cheer them on at no cost to ourselves other than the cost of the military budget.  The cost to soldiers themselves and their families we choose not to share, except for a moment or two of television sympathy.  To me, that's obscene.  But then, what do I know.  I'm just a 72 year old anachronism.

I remember how angry I was when W. started to sell this invasion of Iraq to us here in the US.

I remember all those caskets with the Star Spangled Banner draped over them.  My father had been in Vietnam, you see, and I felt a special kinship with the families of our service men and women that were now destroyed by war, whether having fallen in combat or had to bring what was left of their shattered souls back to start the long process of healing, if they could.  I remember that I felt there would never be another stone-cold jackassed group of incompetent leaders as the administration of George W. Bush.

W showed some elements of what the public had always said was about him, that he was not equipped to run the country.  Everyone has some level of dysfunction in their background but as the story unfolds you see the alcoholism, unstable thinking, and an almost boy-like behavior in W.  Josh Brolin played W-well, he allowed us to see the truth behind the man.  The movie, W also gave us a glimpse into the thought process of Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell because once again the public had always wondered what were they thinking in some of the decisions that were made.  As issues with Osama Bin Ladin and Weapons of Mass Destruction to name a few began to rear its ugly head our country was totally confused as to what was really going on, this movie provides some clarity. There were so many decisions that W made that it crippled our economy for eight years and left to be cleaned up by President Obama and we are still trying to recover.

3439275,1,B0019LY5IC,"Complete garbage, and a total lie meant to deceive people into a more recent history that never happened.  Oliver Stone ocassionally made okay movies like ""Platoon"" or ""Salvadore"", but here and again we find ourselves being bombarded by his Radical Left politics which he tries to prove through a film thesis by promoting outright fantasies sold as historical fact.

 Sure the actors look and mimic the actual people they are attempting to portray, but over all this movie comes off as something equal to a Saturday Night Live parody, rather than an actual political and historical analysis.

 There really isn't anywhere to start when describing the false narrative that Stone paints with this movie, one part that made me sick was when he decided to generally skip the events around 9-11, only to push George Bush as this baffoon instead of the hurt leader that he was after the horrors of that tragedy.

 Oliver Stone has every right to his beliefs, his opinions, and he has his right to make any movie the way he likes it.  But what I find troubling is both Hollywood, and Stone's machine made method of attempting to tell audiences the events in his films actually occurred when nothing further from the truth is the reality.  I have the right however to tell people Stone is full of nonsense, and that little that comes from his should ever be taken seriously, and with a grain of salt with one's nose held closed.  There is nothing wrong with being against the war launched in Iraq, HOWEVER, critical and professional analysis for or against should be based on facts and humanitarian considerations, not on one's radical ideological beliefs. Stone cannot do this, and thus what we have is a fantasy and totally disgusting depiction of a political leader who Stone happens to hate and wants to publicly mock in the name of his mental disorder known as Liberalism (& a very sick one at that.)  F + for this film that belongs deep in the scum bucket.

We jump around a lot and most of the time, it's just kinda like a Worst Moments of George Bush or something. It feels very rushed and very personalized to Oliver Stone's views and never really seems to tap EVERY side of his story we could've gotten. It suffers from the same thing that Wall Street does, over-subtle. And very quiet and very kind of out there. The ending shot of the film is George Bush throwing a ball and it never coming back..

3439406,4,B0019LY5IC,"W., 2008 film

It begins in an empty baseball stadium; it is empty but we hear a crowd cheer. [Symbolism?] President George W. Bush's advisors discuss a political decision. It wasn't Iraq or Iran that attacked us but a group of terrorists. President Bush bows his head. Then its 1966 and we see a college initiation rite for the sons of the very rich at Yale University. Governor, congressman, and ? ""What kind of trouble are you in now?"" He is warned! We see George working on an oil rig; he can't take it [real work]. George meets a young woman in a bar; they dance. He visits his Dad, a war hero, who complains about his behavior. [Birth order?] He can't even hold a job (his family works for a living). George promises to try harder. Poppy will get him out of trouble. Now its the present. One advisor is worried about current events. Are they ready for an unexpected event?

Can they sell the American people on a war on Iraq? ""We don't use torture in this country"" he says. [Its not Official Policy.] But they can use ""intensive interrogations"". A general tells of his plan for ""shock and awe"" [a/k/a Blitzkrieg]. What is their ""exit strategy"" for Iraq? Democracy. Then its 1972 and George drive drunk. He talks back to his father! He got into Harvard Business School! Were strings pulled? In 1977 George W. wins a poker deal [aces and eights?]. They discuss politics, can the 19th District be won? George meets Laura at a party, she is a librarian. His opponent goes personal in attacking George. [Shocking?] Distracted driving? ""Politics is war."" Is their source of information reliable? Then its 1986, ""I love baseball"". His father asks for his help in his run in 1988. Why does George drink so much? Can he be saved? Yes. He talks to his religious advisor. ""Born again""? Karl Rove explains the need for a certain language.

Propaganda can elect a candidate - ""outsourcing"". George H. W. Bush will continue to live in government housing. President Bush's advisors talks up a war on Iraq. 9-11 is an opportunity to act. ""Why are we doing this?"" Why Iraq and not Afghanistan? [Because its about oil.] ""There is no exit strategy - we stay."" But this is a formula for a never-ending war, says one. A real empire? President makes the final decision. President George H. W. Bush explains his decision in 1990. This war is a success! ""Nice job, fellas!"" The voters say otherwise. George W. decides to run for Governor of Texas. They discuss priorities. George W. discusses the campaign and the issues; he is elected. He decides to run for the Presidency, its God's plan.

In 2003 President Bush makes a speech about Saddam's plans to buy uranium. Some criticize his speech. People protest this decision. The UN Inspectors found no evidence. It doesn't matter! Our UN representative argues for US policy. One country will send monkeys trained to detect mines. Some news will be censored. [Isn't this done always?] This war is very successful; it means re-election. TV commentators praise the President [who writes their scripts?]. ""Mission Accomplished."" There is fighting between Sunni and Shiite now. [Divide et impera?] ""Where are those WMD?"" George W. had given up sweets. [Type 2?] How did the CIA make a mistake? [Don't they do as they are told?] ""We were all wrong."" Why don't people understand? Poppy talks to him about wrecking the Bush name (it's a nightmare). What place will he have in history? What mistakes has he made? History will answer in time. [What is your opinion?]

The current economic depression may be his legacy. The failure to regulate Wall Street had created the worst depression since the 1920s. Jobs were ""outsourced"" [""structural unemployment""]. Who will clean up this big mess? This story would be better for me if it went in historical order. While this is a movie, you can read a book about the Bush dynasty and their connections and policies.",1410220800,,3878,4.739259259259259
3439407,5,B0019LY5IC,Since most of us lived through the Bush years and couldn't wait for it to be over I enjoyed it. Too bad the movie did not include some of the fluffs I remember during his reign of insanity. I really thought Oliver Stone went easy on him. Josh Brolin was great and most of the other actors looked very close to the cabinet members. Laura Bush was stronger that what was portrayed on the news. i remember her doing little more than looking at him like a star stuck teenager.,1409616000,,472,4.2555555555555555

3439409,4,B0019LY5IC,"The scene during the White House meeting midway through the film is worth the price of admission itself.  It's such a wonderfully written scene where all of Bush's staff--Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Rove, Rice, Cheney--all state their philosophical case for or against an invasion of Iraq.

Colin Powell says something like:
""The question Is why?  Why are we doing this?  Why Iraq? Why now?  We had America protected September 11th, that is, if people had been doing their jobs right.  But we blew it.  And now instead of taking down these 10,000 al Qaeda lunatics in the mountains of Pakistan with special operations, we're way outside of the box on this thing.  Why aren't we trusting the system?  Why have we veered off to this place, where we accept without debate that a preemptive strike on Iraq can defeat terrorism better than police action or Intelligence agencies that actually share information?  I just don't get it, Mr. President, I don't, because I am a soldier.  And I'd be mighty sure before I put young American lives at risk.  Here we are--(cut off by Rice)  Let me finish! (Slams hand down on table.)  Here we are changing the whole way we do business in response to a small but dedicated enemy hiding out in caves and jungles. Are we losing our perspective here?""

I love this speech.  Stone says in the commentary he's probably giving Colin Powell too much credit--that Powell would've never been this confrontational in person with his colleagues.  But Stone felt he could speak through Powell here, and I think what he does is effective.  That's when Dick Cheney turns to Powell and says, ""You think, with all your diplomatic bull*hit that you can appease Islamic fascists who are as nuts as Hitler?""

Well, that sums up the debate, doesn't it?  The philosophy of this country?  The debate for its soul!  Does it wish to be a force for good, aspiring to global cooperation?  Or does it wish to be something more forceful, something authoritarian?  It couldn't be any more wonderfully summed up, and I commend Stone for this piece of dramatization.

The point is driven home even harder when Wolfowitz says, ""No one's against global cooperation, Colin, you know that. As long as we're calling the shots.""  This statement is a thinly veiled critique of American foreign policy.  As we all know, it's not ACTUAL ""global cooperation"" if America is wielding the sole power, enforcing our beliefs and values at gunpoint.

Sadly, it was Dick Cheney's philosophy that ultimately held sway: ""There is no exit"" in Iraq.  We stay, forever.  And you know what?  I'll be damned if I don't, to this day, still hear about America's involvement in Iraq in the headlines.  It seems America can't help be swayed to Cheney's dark view of the world, this Pax-Americana philosophy.  It's, unfortunately, how the U.S. operates these days, even all these years after the Bush Administration left office.

I don't know, folks.  Do with this review what you will.  Watch the film.  I think the film has terrific empathy for its subjects.  Not quite the vast empathy Oliver Stone showed in his film Nixon, but certainly more careful consideration than these presidents deserve, in my humble opinion.

History will be the ultimate judge.  ""But in history we'll all be dead.""--George W. Bush.",1408233600,,3288,4.864620938628159

It made the viewer empathize with the 43rd president as it presents to us that he was a man who wanted the best for our country. It was just his his lack of abilities and the tendency of being manipulated by people around him that made him do otherwise.

3439468,4,B0019LY5IC,"I grew up in a foreign country where people had the strong suspicion that the president of the united states was possibly not entirely human. That he was prepossessed enough to perhaps not ever have to go to the bathroom. That he (or she?) had god-like powers which lifted him/her above the common man. This movie would contend otherwise. This life would contend otherwise. This movie is like a cartoon show that soars up the rails then zooms down again, to improbable effect. If even one fifth of this is true, this guy is a loaded gun, waiting to go off. And go off he does, again and again and again. And then he slams in to a wall.  Then like the roadrunner, he simply lifts himself up again, under several guises and just keeps on going. An incredible story, if even half of it is true.
It remains to be seen if the talking points Stone has Cheney, Bush, et.al parrot in the movie are true.

Thats like making a movie about FDR and not mentioning WW II, or Reagan and not mentioning  his assasination attempt or Billy Clinton w/o Monica Lewinski. Oliver Stone dropped the ball on this one. The belief is that he could not be as descriptive as he wanted to be during the 9/11 attack without making GWB look presidential, which was what he wanted to avoid doing in this movie. The other train of thought was that the docudrama ""PATH TO 911"" which came out a year before this movie and was banned from production due to  the Clintons because of  it's ""unfare"" interpretation of how the 41st president could have prevented the 911 attacks before it ever happened, would have sparked contraversy if Oliver Stone was allowed to illustrate his own version of that tragic event.",1372032000,,980,4.686046511627907

One line he snaps off to his ""ne'er do well son of privilege"" is ""who do you think you are, running around drinking and chasing tail? a Kennedy? You're a Bush.

W.
By Oliver Stone

Review by
Richard Edward Noble

The fact that this is an Oliver Stone production should have informed any buyer that this would not be a positive portrait of our former president George W. Bush.

It was not.

I was expecting a satirical comedy.

It was satirical but only comedic in a sad but true sort of way.

Dubya is portrayed as a frustrated, immature child who spends his entire life trying to prove himself and win the love and respect of Big Daddy Bush. He is also deeply involved in a sibling competition with his little brother Jeb. ""Big Daddy never loved me as much as he loved you,"" sort of thing.

The depiction of Dubya ranges between a caricature and historical reality.

The portrait is slanted and exaggerated but from what we have all learned of G. W. probably more accurate than we would all like to believe.

Dubya was our ""regular guy"" president. The guy everybody confessed they would like to sit and enjoy a beer with. Unfortunately he may have been far too average, too average to be qualified for the presidency of the United States.

The movie is loaded with excellent actors. This enhances its believability.

Dubya is seen as a rather unlikable fellow with a serious inferiority complex and any number of character flaws.
Every catch phrase and stupid thing that Dubya ever said is worked into the script. It is obvious that he is being manipulated by his vice president and others around him yet he demands to be the ""decider in chief.""

Make no mistake, Dubya is the boss, is the contention.

There are certain historical suggestions that I do not buy. That Dubya and his staff of advisers were truly expecting to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and consequently beside themselves when it did not happen, is one premise of the movie that I cannot accept. That Dubya was so dominant and in charge in his own stupid sort of way is another. That Dubya suffered from many serious moments of introspection and regret, is another. That every cabinet meeting was closed with a prayer of sorts, is difficult to believe and seriously frightening.

If you are not a liberal, I would doubt that you would find this movie entertaining.

I enjoyed it. I've watched it twice.

I think the movie gives Dubya more credit than he deserves. I have even less respect for this man than Mr. Stone.

On the positive side it presents an interesting picture of George Herbert Walker Bush, Big Daddy. Even Mrs. Bush, Dubya mother, doesn't appear to be as brash and obnoxious as she has been characterized elsewhere.

This movie will certainly never be classified in the historical, documentary category. It is in the entertainment category and possibly in the political satire venue.

If you are a liberal you will find the movie contains more truth than fiction. If you are a conservative, it will rank as a bad joke.

From either perspective, liberal or conservative, it is definitely a sad joke.

3439516,5,B0019LY5IC,"After watching this a number of times I recommend viewing the special feature ""Dangerous Dynasty"" first then watch the movie. It explains the evolution of 'permanent war' we find ourselves in and introduces the viewer to most all of the responsible players. The movie portrays W as a son trying hard to measure up to his dad and brothers. I am no Bush fan but I can see how he could have been raised to be a spoiled egomaniac who refused to listen to the right people and whose ego would eventually not allow him to even 'ask' for opinions. Unfortunately, he seemed to repent his choices when it was far too late and the damage had been done to death, the war and economy out of control. I'm pretty sure that the Florida vote was 'managed' by his ex CIA dad like so many other 'strings' he'd pulled for W. over the years and for who knows what personal agenda.

Obviously, the days of Platoon, NBK, and JFK are a distant, quickly fading, memory.  It is as if he felt obligated to finish a once promising project he lost interest in.  Brolin makes a good Bush and Wright does well as Powell but the rest are just poorly cast public image caricatures best suited for SNL.  The movie is surprisingly lighthearted, even mildly sympathetic in portraying a bunch of people who used a national tragedy and nonexistent evidence of wmds as an excuse to invade the wrong country.  War crimes.  Treason.  Bush and his camp, besides Powell, were arrogant, insular C+ students steeped in simplistic Manichean world views.  The world is suffering for their crimes of incompetence.  Bush isn't stupid, just weak, directionless, desperate to be liked, approved of by his father and, thus, prone to being bullied and condescended to.  Brolin portrays this excellently.  I think Bush really did believe there were wmds and was shocked and angered to realize he'd been the unwitting participant in a massive dupe.  How sad.

3439519,1,B0019LY5IC,"I'd been hoping to see W since it was released years ago.  Last night, I finally caught a TV airing and sat down to watch.  It was AWFUL, the way a plane crash is awful where everyone burns to death in front of you.  I do admit, I'm no fan of George W Bush.  I believe he was incompetent as President and did a lot of harm to our country and its international reputation.  I can't think of one thing he did that I find redeemable to his legacy.  That said, I had no incentive to change my mind based on this movie.  Stone portrays Bush as a whiny, dumb, ignorant, petulant, selfish, pretty boy.  He is a drunk and an ugly one at that (perhaps there's no other kind).  The scene at the party where he meets Laura Welch is amazing.  She is gorgeous and educated.  He is drunk, barely lucid.  What she saw in him is beyond me, unless it was just the fact that he would take care of her and her life would be interesting due to his family (this is alluded to in a scene in the movie).  Not long after the party scene, I stopped watching and balanced my checkbook, a far more interesting project than watching the movie. I knew it just wasn't going to be possible for me to care about this non-person (remember, this is how Stone seemed to portray him) who felt the world owed him something even though he was at the bottom of the barrel in terms of the members of his family.

3439548,3,B0019LY5IC,"I read Dick Cheney's book ""In My Time,"" which - minus a few issues here and there - was a very good read.  And naturally, I was around during George Bush Jr.'s presidency.  So, I have a pretty good idea what might be fact and what might be fiction.

Now, you can argue until you're blue in the face who is at ""fault"" for the Iraq war, making the assumption that the Iraq war was indeed a mistake.  (I'm on the fence a bit, because I understand that we can't know what might or would have happened if we hadn't entered the war.  Things might have been worse, and without traveling to an alternate universe, we'll never know.)  You may same the same thing about the Vietnam War, a war that the Democrats started for us.  Maybe both were a bad idea?  Maybe one was good, the other bad?  Maybe they both were a good idea?  Who knows?  No one will.

But if you can get past all of the politics, I believe that the problem with this film is simply the following:  the casting director decided that it was more important to find actors that looked like the people that they were playing rather than were simply good actors.  There are exceptions, of course.  I believe that Josh Brolin was an excellent choice, as was Richard Dreyfuss.  The Condaleeza Rice actor (I have no idea who she is and I don't care) was terrible.  Sorry, but this is truth.  And the Colin Powell character?  Meh.  Passable; barely.

One other issue:  if you followed Bush's presidency, you will notice that his English improved dramatically over time.  Naturally, he had a coach, perhaps his wife?  He mostly dropped his southern accent (Americans mistakely believe that someone with a southern accent is less intelligent) and his grammar improved dramatically.  So dramatically, in fact, that his speech patterns were much better than the average American.  He does have a much higher IQ than average, after all, somewhere around 124 I believe.  (The average American:  98.)

I did like how the writing - and acting by Mr. Brolin - did a good job of at least showing GW's motivations.  Not bad there.  But overall, I'd have to give this film a mild pass.",1349913600,2,2123,4.522427440633245
3439549,4,B0019LY5IC,"This film does a very good job of capturing the intellectual calibre of George ""Dubya"" Bush, and the crucial moment in history when the decision to invade Iraq was made. The performances were very realistic and at times I thought I was watching the real George Bush, particularly in the scenes where he is making speeches. All the peformances were excellent but I thought Thandie Newton was particularly good as Condeleezza Rice.

Those people who claim the film is not realistic must not realize how much of the dialogue is verbatim quotes directly from the horse's mouth, so to speak. It was hilarious and yet so disturbing to be reminded of the ""Bushisms"" that became so common during his presidency. It is clear to me that the film has been meticulously researched to capture the reality as closely as possible, and in my view it is very effective.

Others have claimed the film is not tough enough on Dubya. I found it to be absolutely scathing, but in a way which might go over some people's heads if they are distracted by the soundtrack and seemingly affectionate portrayal of his weaknesses. Perhaps Stone didn't mean it to be interpreted this way, but this is how I saw it. There is nothing affectionate about this film. It's message is extremely serious, and so it should be considering how many lives have been lost in the debacle that is the Iraq war.

The most powerful moments in the film for me are when Cheyney points out that the real issue for the US when it comes to the Middle East is oil. All the talk about freedom and human rights and protection from terrorist threats are just a cover for their desire to control the region, and thus the largest oil fields on earth. This is why they twisted the evidence of WMDs and ignored all the warnings they didn't exist. Dubya feels extremely angry and betrayed when things begin to fall to pieces and he demands to know why they all got it wrong. No one can answer him because they played him like a fiddle and he is just too stupid and naive to recognise this.

The other scene that stays with me is when he is in bed with his wife, and he can't sleep because of all the stress over the war. She leans over and says to him that if won't last forever and they will get their lives back eventually. It really drove home how divorced from the consequences of their actions world leaders are. What about all the people who have been killed and maimed and had their lives ripped to pieces by this pointless war of aggression? They can't retire to their ranches and spend the rest of their days playing golf to get over it. I have no doubt that very few of those involved in orchestrating this war think much about the victims, to them they are just collateral damage. This film exposes the complete moral bankruptcy at the heart of American politics during Bush's presidency and beyond.

There is also quite a bit left out in this film which would have strengthened it and given more insight into the man, but overall it's definitely worth watching.",1348272000,,3011,4.517431192660551
3439550,3,B0019LY5IC,"Viewers expect many things from an Oliver Stone film, not the least of which is controversy. So it is quite surprising that what we have here is a very bland film. Perhaps that is because so much is known about Bush's life - his wilder days in college, his mediocre performance as a student, his often troubled relationship with his father, his post-born-again days, when he focused more on his ""calling"" to a political career, and, of course, his well-documented eight years as president, especially the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The script simply provides no new insights into the man or the administration, which is a shame because the acting (with, perhaps, the exception of Thandie Newton's caricature of Condolezza Rice) is uniformly good: Josh Brolin's George W., James Cromwell's elder Bush, Richard Dreyfus' Dick Cheyney, Scott Glenn's Donald Rumsfeld, Jeffrey Wright's Colin Powell, and Toby Jones' Karl Rove. It's worth renting, but just don't go into the film with great expectations.",1341964800,,1000,5.141104294478527
3439551,3,B0019LY5IC,"I bet you cannot watch this movie without asking yourself, ""How much of this is true?"" Not just what's verified and what is speculation, but how accurate do you suppose the guesses are? It's very spooky, this movie. Holding a mirror up to what we have just lived through, and at a time when we did not yet know whether Obama would win and change things, or McCain would win and continue the basic plan.

For one thing, most of the people who play well-known figures look quite like their roles, even Richard Dreyfuss as Darth Cheney. In fact, Josh Brolin as W. and James Cromwell as H.W. are the only two who are not particularly look-alikes, in that both actors are rather more lean and angular than the presidents were. Thandie Newton is positively spooky as Condi Rice. Toby Jones is a little smaller than Karl Rove, but just as slimy. Jeffrey Wright does not at first look all that much like Colin Powell, but he grows into the role -- or his makeup does.

The early part of W's life is the only part we have not seen before, although we certainly heard about it. We see his fraternity initiation, but not his Skull and Bones one. We see him chatting up a Texas gal and persuading her that he's going to marry her, and then later hear that his father had to ""take care of her"" when she came up pregnant. He's in jail for reckless driving, and his father bails him out. But in his job in the oil fields, his try at Wall Street, and especially his lack of focus more generally, H.W. is deeply disappointed, and says so. In real life and in W.'s nightmares.

We are also ""treated"" to his drying-out from alcohol, his born-again experience, his belief that God was calling him to run for president. Still, there seems to be more of the whiff of brimstone than the odor of sanctity about the man, especially ending every cabinet meeting with a silent prayer. If it was not phony, I almost wish it had been.

The decision to invade Iraq, the Cheney power hunger, the way everyone in that cabinet room could go along with Cheney's plan to take over the entire middle east by surrounding and then conquering Iran; it's all so spooky that I simply cannot help asking myself: how much of this is the truth?

It's a well-made movie about a very unsettling topic, and I would have preferred if the two men who portrayed the Bush presidents looked a little more like the real Bushes. Can't have everything. I would also have like more about some topics and less about others, but on the whole, the story hangs together as the biography of a man who never should have been elected to any office, let alone the presidency.",1336953600,,2611,4.43125
3439552,2,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone establishes at the beginning of ""W."" that's it's fictional, with George Jr. imagining he's the Texas Rangers centerfielder. Conversations are invented, facts altered, important players eliminated, composite characters presented as real. Later, there's a dream sequence where Jesus tells Dubya to run for president, him drifting off to fantasy land during a strategy session and a nightmare of Pappy Bush challenging him to a fistfight.

He's portrayed as two-faced: gregarious with the public but a bully with staff and team members. Bush eats like a pig: with his mouth open, takes a dump in a small hotel room with the bathroom door open and wife Laura nearby. He's too stupid in a press conference to answer a simple question: what's your biggest regret? Fumbles with it for two minutes. Stone relishes such bad light moments as Bush choking on a pretzel or fighting with his parents.

At the end, after it's learned there were no WMDs in Iraq, and that the president has antagonized the world by his invasion and overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he blames everyone but himself. The last scene mimics the first: Dubya stands at the centerfield wall, looking stupidly for an invisible fly ball. (You dropped the ball, George!)

In the director's commentary track, he never once pronounces Donald Rumsfeld's last name correctly. Why is that?

3439554,1,B0019LY5IC,"I have an abiding interest in American politics, and by extension the personalities and philosophies of our presidents. That made the PBS American Experience series on the presidents a natural choice. I thought I should give this dramatized depiction a try, especially considering how well the former president seems to lend himself to parody.

This film, though, isn't aimed at parody. It's certainly silly, and perhaps intended for the shortest-attention, lowest-common-denominator audience. It's certainly not serious from a documentary or biographical perspective. Most of the content seems embellished. The only framing is a handful of major events of which most Americans are already aware.

The actors are clearly intended to represent actual politicians, but their looks / voices / mannerisms are far from convincing. The result is a sort of uncanny valley, where you expect these actors to represent reality but they have flaws that are hard to pinpoint exactly. It's not even a psychoanalysis, because any introspection is superficial and stereotypical. On that note, the constant riffs on Bush's Texas heritage and accent wear out quickly.

In terms of other story elements: you've got a typical boy-meets-girl romance, a rebellious son who constantly disappoints his father, a silver spoon fraternity boy whose father buys his way into Yale and then Harvard, and a tough-talking man in charge who craves war. These were all elements of George W. Bush's life, but they could have been presented in a more subtle way, and his personality shown in a more sensitive light. Ultimately I feel apathetic about the film. It seems to have been a half-hearted effort. Really, though, it's empty and soulless.

It's all terribly superficial and uninformative. Jersey Shore: D.C. comes to mind. I didn't learn a single important thing about the man. Don't watch this.",1335052800,7,1867,5.297297297297297
3439555,5,B0019LY5IC,"Before writing this review, I examined many other reviews of this product from Amazon. This film is a thought provoking work of art, similar to Frost/Nixon directed by Ron Howard. In the film, we see different facets of the man who was President twice. When examining all of the one star reviews, I was taken aback to discover that about half were railing against the nice treatment by Stone of GWB, and the other half saying it was just leftist propaganda. I found that almost strange.

This film is a psychological treatment of GWB, who was set in a rivalry against members inside his party, against the democrats, and even elements inside his own family (his own rivalry with Jeb and his father). What comes out in the film (at least to me) is that GWB had to go his own way as President and make his own errors, which he did in abundance. Stone's treatment of GWB shows him as completely human, similar to his treatment of Nixon. Both men were powerful human beings with fatal flaws. Yet both completely believed that what they were doing was right for the American people.

Stone merely points out how history will treat GWB. There is, however, an enormous amount of history that Stone fails to see, that he skirts around, some of which will probably never be revealed. The most interesting pieces of the film to me were the relationship of GWB with Cheney (played ably by Dreyfuss). Because Bush wanted to ""be his own man"", he allowed Cheney and his minions to take on the major role in the war on terror. In reality, they directed the entire operation. The scenes between Cheney and Powell are real, and represent the entire conflicted roles of the American people on the world stage after 9/11. Bush wanted to be seen as a man of action, not a man who (like his father) could be thoughtful.

There is an epilogue to all of this. What Stone fails to see was that Bush actually began to distance himself from Cheney around 2007, and did become his own man, his father's son. Maybe that should be the Bush legacy. Personally, I did not think much of the Bush presidency, and I believe that his own flaws were fatal to the American polity, particularly as it deals with our relationships with the rest of the world.

I would look forward to a movie from Oliver Stone about the man who actually wielded all the power during this time, another fatally flawed leader, Richard Bruce Cheney.",1334966400,2,2390,4.564102564102564
3439576,3,B0019LY5IC,"Josh Brolin did an absolutely tremendous job playing W, his performance was just great.

I put off on watching this movie for a long time because I know that Oliver Stone is only slightly lower down the totem pole of whacked out asinine Hollywood fools that feel the need to push their ultra PC/liberal agenda, he's much smarter than the few that sit above him on that totem pole like the idiotic propaganda minister Michael Moore.  I was afraid that the movie would be more like one of Moore's totally unbearable films but Stone did a decent job trying not to go totally overboard with his liberal agenda.  Although there were a number of places in the film where Stone completely departed from anything that even resembled reality but it was done in a way that did add some more entertainment value to the film, some of it was somewhat offensive due to some flat out lies & some absurd presumptions.

All in all, I really enjoyed the film for what it is, nothing more than a movie with very little factual information & obviously a great deal of nonsensical bashing of the Bush administration.  That being said, it had no affect on the way I look at W or what I already know to be facts regarding him & his administration.

What does annoy me about films like this is that if the shoe was on the other got and the movie was about or current idiot & chief, it would have turned out to be one long, butt kissing ceremony especially if it were done by Stone.

But whatever, i'm a big fan of W & despise the current administration yet I still really did enjoy this movie and there were instances that were based on fact that actually taught me a few things I didn't already know.  Of course, I had to fact check just about everything but learned some interesting stuff about a young
W.

Because of that, it is hard to evaluate a film about Bush without it becoming a Rorschach blot for one`s own sensibilities concerning that brutish quasi-troglodyte himself and, as well, his malevolent Svengali-like chief accomplice, Vice-President Dick Cheney, who was even more mendaciously cynical and venile than the other members of Bush`s cabinet; as well to account for, as Oliver Stone`s film does so to too slight extent, is the equally trigger-happy, pro-Zionist, and profiteering innermost coterie within the Pentagon during Bush`s time as president.

Such coteries, of course, burrowed themselves elsewhere into the various branches of U.S. goverment and within the Civil Service, often establishing therein platforms for private gain (when ""conflicts of interest"" too seldom even were acknowledged), for suppressing competition, for ""neo-con"" manipulation of information, for circumvention or even outright elimination of publicly beneficial regulation (especially of financial institutions), and for skewing policy and its enforcement to their own favour and to the political, diplomatic, and military fortunes of their neo-con ideology. Stone alights fleetingly and obliquely upon some aspects of this here and there in his film, which, however, is far from emphasising the motives of personal enrichment as, under Bush Jr. and under Obama, the U.S. has been morphing into militaristic, autocratic kleptocracy. The film treats at considerable length many of these matters, for example and importantly, the Bush Administration`s deeply entrenched connexions in, and profits from, the petroleum industry in the U.S. and in the Middle East (which the film and its special features, indeed, do emphasise but don`t note explicitly enough the orgy of profiteering greed and partiality which that engendered among the Republican super-rich oil barons). Furthermore, there is dealing with such matters, too, but still rather cautiously, among what ""W., the Official Film Guide"", the DVD-Rom special feature on this DVD of the film, amplifies in words.  The film itself attempted to touch upon these matters with subtlety (perhaps too much so for optimal effectiveness) rather than with hard-hitting explicitness. Neo-con zealots who make their own deluded projections upon the central figure of his time and of this film as somehow being of heroic stature only show what fools that they can be.

All of that said, it would have been better for this viewer, maybe for others, also, to see the special features documenting this film. They are really excellent and ""Dangerous Dynasty: the Bush Presidency"", the apt title of the special feature that conveys the message very tellingly, presents some of the best scholars and public figures of the American political Left and Centre commenting upon the harm that presidents from Nixon and Reagan onwards have done to undermine American consitutional rule. One begins to realise that the director was much more grimly critical of Bush than may seem to be the case at first exposure to the film itself. The DVD would be worth having for this feature alone, but the movie does happen to be a good one.

Bush was far more of an hypocrite, along with his other odious qualities (which Stone conveys well), than Oliver Stone seems to want to admit. As unintelligent and vulgar as the barbarian was, Bush knew how to manipulate the public and how to pose. It is well known, despite Stone`s acceptance of Bush Jr.`s religious posturing, that the scope and kind this rogue president`s religiosity has been little more than a thin veneer, far from being genuinely evangelical or sincerely pious. (The man is a believer of some sort, a Christian loosely speaking, more or less akin doctrinally to a ""skin-deep"" moderate mainline Protestant with pietist veneer, whatever Bush`s varying denominational affiliation at any particular time, but that does NOT make him any kind of evangelical zealot, indeed, very evidently not that, judging from many of his reported statements in public and in private.)  Secular culture, such as Stone`s, tends to differentiate such matters quite inadequately, lumping Christian believers into a fictive ""Religious Right"" that is more broadly inclusive and more seemingly cohesive than that elusive movement is in reality.  It is hard to accept, too, that Bush really was taken by surprise at the revelations of the dishonesty of his own and his cronies` war-mongering campaign to involve the U.S. militarily in Iraq. The man certainly played his own part in fobbing off intentionally such deceptions upon the gullible American public.

Enough said. The man was and is loathsome, even more so than as Stone depicts him. The film is well made and effective in its own way, but, egad, what an unworthy subject Bush Jr. (and even Bush Sr., whose role in the film and in the infamous son`s life receives lots of attention) makes for an artist of Oliver Stone`s cinematic stature!",1326931200,,5149,5.271951219512195
3439579,4,B0019LY5IC,"""W"" is an interesting movie by one of the masters of persuasion, Oliver Stone. Here, Stone tells the story of George W. Bush with subtle and not so subtle biases (heavy drinking tarnishing his image, foul language, etc.) I enjoyed the film, for the most part. The biggest criticism I have is Stone's decision to go back and forth between time periods instead of telling the story from the beginning to end. It all seems to work, however. Stone reinforces all of the negatives that permeated W's life (drinking, especially) in order to create the image that W was unsuited for any of the positions (from a character standpoint) that he held in politics, as well as depicting him as inept and unintelligent. Josh Brolin does a good job as W, but he could've mastered his mannerisms that we've all become familiar with over the years. Richard Dreyfuss plays the perfect Dick Cheney, and does a superior job portraying the VP, though it must've been painful for him to play the role of a conservative. The movie focuses on the Iraq War, and all of the blunders that occured from its inception. In some ways, this movie reminded me of Fahrenheit 9/11, with its satirical components. Overall, this movie works on some levels, but comes up short on others.",1324252800,3,1249,4.707762557077626

3439581,4,B0019LY5IC,"George W. Bush, is not only considered the WORST President by Presidential historians, but he is also considered the most controversial. Oliver Stone did his best (with what he had to work with at the time) of what was known about George W.Bush (as most of his past has been sealed up lock and key; him testifying before the SEC about his failed businesses and his businesses investments, his driving record in New Hampshire, him disappearing when he was transferred from the Texas Air National Guard to the Alabama Air National Guard), and, love him or hate him, Oliver Stone made the film and did his best with what he had to work with.

George W. Bush (Josh Brolin) is a hard-drinking, trouble-making, Yale baseball cheerleader. He get's into Yale (thanks to his father, who he calls ""Poppy"" throughout the film), get's into TONS of trouble (George W. Bush was the first person as President to enter office with a criminal record), and after he graduates from Yale, he meets his future wife Laura Welsh (Elizabeth Banks) at a BBQ. The film goes back and forth with him as a young man and through the beginnings of the stages of Gulf War 2. The film also goes through the events of him running for the Texas State Senate; he loses, and it's their that he becomes a born-again Christian. His father, runs for the White House in 1988, wins, and his son George helps him with his public campaign; it's their that George W. Bush meets Karl Rove (Karl Rove has been known as 'Bush's Brain', and Karl's nickname, given by W. was 'turd blossom'). Karl helps George run for Governor of Texas beating Texas Democratic Governor Ann Richards in 1994. As George W. Bush's second term as Texas Governor ends in 1999, he decides to run for President. As said before, the film goes back and forth with him giving the call to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein; as we all know, the victory was short-lived and began a bloody insurgency against American troops and our allies in Iraq.

As for George W. Bush, Oliver Stone portrays him as confused, and just being used as a puppet while his Vice President Dick Cheney was holding the real power; George was just for show. The people in his Administration showed extreme loyalty to him, and never disagreed with him about anything (except with a few; one being Colin Powell). George, in the film, looks and feels like a small child who is lost and doesn't understand what is going on with everything around him.

The historical inaccuracies are here and there, but I explained what they were; one of them (I failed to mention) was his two failed oil businesses called Arbusto Energy and Harken Energy; it wasn't mentioned in the film, but it also doesn't mentioned his connections once his failed businesses filed for Chapter 11 (who bailed him out); the people that bailed him out where The Bin Laden Group for an undisclosed amount of money (his testimony to the Securities and Exchange Commission is under lock and key for another 40 years), his driving record in New Hampshire in 1974 is under lock and key, and what happened to him during those two years when he was transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard is anybody's guess.

Through this film does have some historical inaccuracies, it definitely brings George W. Bush as just plain confused, and trying to get under daddy's shadow (as he is trying to do through the whole film). It's a interesting look at the most controversial Presidents in American history; is it missing some facts? Yes it is, but if you go into this film, and look at it for what it is, you will see it is rather well told.",1313539200,,3599,4.627543035993741

Stone ensures he remains a sympathetic character because of an endearing vulnerability, despite the destructive consequences of a President swinging between florid impulsiveness on the one hand and crippling indecisiveness on the other.

I'm only about 1/2 an hour into this film, and I have already spotted some glaring errors. There's Phi Delta Kappa, the fake fraternity that W is shown being initiated into (apparently Stone has been intimidated into keeping silent that W is a Bonesman), and W claiming to be a Texan (he was born in Maine) and an Episcopalian (he's a Catholic), and there's still another 90 minutes to go!

However, I'd been pleasantly surprised by his filmmaking before like 9/11 where he remained solemn and pretty much politically neutral. But he threw all of that out the window in making W.  I voted for George W. Bush twice and appreciated his strong leadership through some very difficult moments in our nation's history guided by his faith in God who sustained him through it all.  Stone chose to mock Bush's faith and attempt to paint him as a hypocrite and a blundering idiot.  He is neither.  President Bush did more good for this country than people give him credit for which has become all the more apparent with the buffoon who's running the White House these days.  At every opportunity in W, we see Bush made to look like a little kid who needs to be reprimanded and George W. Bush deserves better than this.  I'll give Josh Brolin credit, he got the role down perfect--although I'm sure Oliver Stone coached him to play up the idiocy more than what the real President Bush exhibited.

He comes across as a spoilt, rich boy desperately seeking his fathers approval and who slowly starts to believe his own hype and propaganda. This film shows how much influence Cheney actually had and also how much Karl Rove manipulated and lead Bush throughout his political career. The war is shown to be about oil and imperialist ambition and although Bush believed in what he was doing, he is shown to be misguided and flawed in his world view. This film is well directed with excellent performances from both Brolin and Dreyfuss. Thandie Newton, on the other hand, was terrible, her accent and overall acting is very wooden and lacks any skill whatsoever. Bush comes across as a very religious man and ultimately he let his religion influence his politics, to the detriment of world political stability and this film shows that aspect very well. This isn't the most flattered bio-pic of George W Bush but it does give a deeper understanding of his character, even if it does reinforce your negative opinions of him and his deeply flawed administration.

Bush's presidency is too recent to seek historical perspective. Stone is smart to not try.

You can argue merits, but Bush in W. is likable if not bright. Fun to watch.

3439593,1,B0019LY5IC,"Its interesting how time takes its toll on art, music, movies and the truth. I was happy that Oliver Stone rushed this film into theaters in hopes that its extremely unfavorable painting of the current President would help John Kerry defeat him. Theater goers stayed away in droves....maybe due to the poor reviews maybe because they felt they were living it and too close (my reasoning)and others maybe pulled the plug on believing Oliver Stone could make anything relevant a decade before.

Now that we have plenty of accurate accounts of the events portrayed in this film its clear it was historically wrong (a book could be written on that alone) and on top of that poor film making. Oliver Stone's cement style heavy handed approach seems directed to either left wing haters or those in the audience with IQs in the double digits. This story should, and still could, be done in a way which is less black and white and much much more in the mid tones. Stone's portrayal of these individuals is extremely one dimensional and often comical! For a glimpse at how ridiculous this movie is just listen to the actress playing Condi Rice for five seconds and you can get an accurate gauge on the entire movie.  These are real life people and yet the screenplay and movie inject less into them than a good movie with imagined characters!  How can you take this movie maker seriously when he refuses to inject any humanity into anybody in the story he does not like?

Its almost impossible to make a movie of events while they are still unfolding...and Stone's joke of a film W. proves that. Stone is chasing relevance with his film making for some time  and continuing to fail....football, 911, George Bush,  and more recently Wall Street again.

If he has to keep making movies perhaps he should find another Tarantino (who scripted Natural Born Killers) and just direct a brilliant script by somebody who actually HAS a voice. His chasing trends instead of setting them ...has failed.

3439606,4,B0019LY5IC,"The main thing you need to know about W. is that it shows you the life of George W. Bush from a rather funny (and quite often, accurate) point of view.  From his early days when he first met Laura at a party, to his constant disagreements with his father, to the constant comparison to his brother Jeb, to his early campaign trails, to his eventual presidency of the United States.  W. covers this territory pretty well.

Now here's how the movie works- while *those* events are taking place, quite often the story will switch in a different direction that shows the events (portrayed by characters, of course) where Cheney, Powell, Condoleezza Rice and the rest of the gang were discussing the best strategies concerning the war in Iraq.

All the characters were convincing in their roles, not to mention really *do* resemble their real life counterparts.  Just look at them and try telling me they don't look and act almost exactly like them.

What's especially strange about W. is how it shows George Bush as someone who doesn't seem like he has the dedicated desire (or the intelligence level) to eventually become president of the United States.

This means Bush comes off looking rather odd because he's portrayed as someone who definitely wants to change the world and someone who is definitely passionate about doing so (and as we know, he does eventually achieve his dream of becoming US president) but the storyline develops in a way that makes it look like *anyone* can accomplish the same incredible goal, which is honestly not true at all.

Then again, maybe that's the point.  Maybe the point is that the writers were trying to make Bush appear like an average man from the get go.  That way we can see how flawed he really is.

Anyway, the political arguments dealing with the war in Iraq and the oil supply were interesting in the beginning, but because they are portrayed quite accurately, the only thing these scenes really did for me was allow me to remember the past 8 years.  So for me, the strong point of W. were the humorous segments that focused on how George Bush eventually got into office and less on the Iraq war.

W. is a good trip down memory lane with a bit of humor thrown in (especially whenever Bush tries to say something intelligently and ends up stuttering and saying something half-witted- this happens a LOT).  It combines the real life situations with a touch of the fictional pretty well... at least, I assume certain parts are fictional.",1282780800,,2480,4.697459584295612
3439607,5,B0019LY5IC,"I came to Oliver Stones ""W"" with any number of preconceptions, many of them not helped by an early trailer which made the entire exercise look like a parody of the man and his presidency; and while it's true, the film does contain satirical elements, I didn't consider them to be at the man's expense. True, the notorious pretzel incident is re-enacted; yes, we are treated to the sight of a tipsy Bush dancing on a bar and, yes, the wilderness years of his youth are examined in no small amount of detail. But this film, which simultaneously explores Bush's ascendancy from Yale pledge to CIC and the machinations of his administration during the run-up to the Iraq war, is a hypnotically fascinating, even-handed and highly intelligent piece of film-making which is far more than just a satirical biopic.

Oliver Stone has always been a film-maker I can take or leave. At his best, he can be an incisive explorer of cultural zeitgeist, at his worst he is little better than an exploitation film-maker; his output over the last couple of years has veered wildly between these two polarities, but with ""Bush"" he really has hit a home-run. There is no doubt in my mind that this is probably due to Stanley Weiser's excellent script and Josh Brolin's astonishing turn as the man himself (and if Brolin doesn't get an Oscar for this, it will only be due to the academy's cowardice). Stone has always been a film-maker who uses broad mythic sweeps in order to reveal a greater personal truth about his subject matter, and, once again, he doesn't resist that tendency here. Brolin's Bush begins his life as a man struggling with both the expectations impressed upon him by his birth into a dynastic political legacy and the passive disapproval of his father; the story then is essentially a tale of the son attempting to seek the approval of (and then usurp) the father's authority. But if this sounds like a deeply simplistic rendering of the complexities of a modern American figure, let me assure you that this is only the spine of a story on which Stone hangs the flesh of a sympathetic and even-handed treatment of the man.

Stone's examinations of the conflicts, resentments and motivations within the Bush cabinet are as fascinating as his portrait of the man himself. Those who ascribe to the theory that the entire Bush presidency was in fact a case of ""the tail wagging the dog"" will no doubt appreciate Richard Dreyfuss' brilliantly subtle turn as a vaguely Machiavellian Dick Cheney (referred to throughout the film as ""Vice"") but the film stops significantly short of painting him outright as the sinister puppet-master pulling all of the strings; and while possibly the film's best scene -  in which, during the course of a situation meeting,  Jeffrey Wright's superbly gruff Colin Powell questions the motivations of invading Iraq only to have Dreyfuss' Cheney illustrate them in unflinchingly certain terms -  is undoubtedly mythologizing, but one finds it virtually impossible to deny, given the well-documented differences in both ideology and policy that existed between Powell and Cheney, that discussions and disagreements of this nature undoubtedly took place.

There are no villains in ""W""; merely people attempting to make the best decisions that they can with the information that they have (or more significantly, haven't) got at the time. The film doesn't excuse or condone the actions of the Bush administration in regard to declaring a probably illegal war on a Iraq on the pretext of it's possession of nebulous WMDs, but it does give you an insight into the thinking behind those decisions.

""W"" ends on a brilliantly ambiguous final shot which is a superbly sympathetic and utterly fitting metaphor for Bush as a man, a president, and, most poignantly, a misguided architect of a war declared on a spurious pretext which still grinds inexorably on to this day.",1281571200,,3887,4.916158536585366

W. was a great movie. Josh Brolin was excellent as our 43th president, getting many of his manerisms down.

You really see from the film the pressure that Bush felt with never living up to his father's standards, which Jeb Bush did. Bush wasn't the smartest man in the world, let alone in the family, but he was sincerce, honest, and incredibly loyal to his father, who consistently reminds him that he's disappointed in him.

Throughout the film, it is made clear that Bush loves baseball, and if he had a say so, he would have been MLB commish instead of President of the United States. He is shown several times throughout the movie at the baseball stadium playing center fielder and getting a standing ovation to an empty stadium. It was his dream, a dream that never happened.

Instead, Bush went on to help his father run for President in 1988, and again in 1992. Following his loss to Clinton, Bush become agitated that his father didn't attack and go after Clinton the way he would have, and this sets up Bush's run at the governor's spot in Texas and eventually his run for the President. It was all to avenge his father and try a bit to live up to this standards.

The film has a very interesting exchange with Bush and his cabinet regarding the upcoming war in Iraq and the possiblity of setting up an American Empire (to ensure that the USA would never be messed with again).

finally, the film delves into the missing weapons of mass destruction. Bush, under the advise of his cabinet that despite proof, but rather based on possiblity, there was a chance that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Once it was discovered that nothing was found, Bush had no choice but to tell the people what they didn't want to hear, that he went on the advice of his people and that the Congress voted on the same evidence (or lack of) that he had.

Overall, the film is interesting and solid. Once again, Oliver Stone has assembled an all-star cast, and none disappoint in the film.",1278806400,,2382,4.538461538461538
3439609,3,B0019LY5IC,"I was expecting either a total blasting of the former President who only won one election, but what we ended up getting was a messed up conglomeration of a love-hate relationship.  Oliver Stone seemed to want to go all out with Dubya, but it seems something was holding him back.  I haven't many other Oliver Stone films, so I don't have much of a reference from my point of view, but you have to start somewhere.

Anyways, getting to the point, Oliver Stone seemed to want to show that Dubya was in waaaayyyy over his head and he didn't know it until it was way too far.  He did a good job of showing that, but the lead in and pretty much the entire movie seemed to not want to lead to such a point.  An example of this is the score, which I didn't like.  The songs didn't fit in with the movie very much.  There was too much trying to be funny and entertaining and not enough of trying to be dramatic.  The actors, camera, etc. would try to get to a depressing, dramatic moment, and then the audio would switch to a poppy, bubbly song during that, and it completely killed the mood.

Now, I hate Bush as much as the next guy, but I still would like to see a movie that would know where it wants to go.  This movie seemed to want to be either hard or soft on him, and it never found a good middle ground.  This would have been much better off if it had been just a depressing story of his life or a beat-the-crap-out-of-him type of film, but, especially at the end, it never gets it right.

The movie also forced too many of the ""Bushisms"" we know and love, which at first was like ""Hehe, he said that,"" and quickly became ""I know, now get on with the movie.""  There were times when this movie tried to be dramatic and they threw in a Bushism and it didn't mix so well, but there were other times when it made the movie.

Overall, I give this movie a 6/10.

It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good.  My main beef with this movie is the score, which I feel destroyed much of the movie.  I can see where they were going, but it just didn't work out.",1272326400,,2052,4.115577889447236
3439610,4,B0019LY5IC,"This film is a mixture of political commentary and character analysis, making it far more interesting that I expected. However, as character study and as political commentary it only goes so deep before turning back, as if the Oliver Stone doesn't totally trust the viewing public with all the details. The film actually paints a sympathetic picture of President George W Bush. This is due to the tension depicted between the cool Episcopalian statesman George Bush and his born-again evangelical son, George W Bush. In some regards, George W Bush follows the policies and ideology of Ronald Reagan rather then the realist approach of his father. The issue of the President's alcoholism was handled very well as we see the President move beyond his alcoholism through his religious faith and the support of his pastor, played by Stacey Keach. There were four events that are missing from the film that are highly significant and I certainly would have been willing to watch 1 more hour of film to see how Stone would interpret the events around the Gore vs. Bush 2000 election struggles in Florida, the response to September 11th, Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, and the Joe Wilson - Valerie Plame incident that revealed so much about the power of the Vice President in framing the war effort with Iraq. However since the film is not really meant to be comprehensive history, and only comments on policy indirectly, it is the character of George W Bush that is the true subject of the film.

Josh Brolin is excellent as George W Bush as is Richard Dreyfuss in the role of Vice President Dick Cheney. George and Barbara Bush are played by James Cromwell and Ellen Burstyn. They do an excellent job of creating the family of origin tensions that drive much of George W Bush's motivations and actions, at least in this interpretation. Elizabeth Banks plays Laura Bush, the most likeable character in the film. Her support for her husband and faith that he will eventually muddle through appears to be one of his greatest assets. I wish the role of Dick Cheney had been larger since we now know the pivotal role in played in the decision to invade Iraq and the growing distance between the President and Vice President during the last 18 months of his second term when President Bush distanced himself from Cheney, the architect of many of the failures of the Bush Presidency. Jeffrey Wright plays the reflective far-seeing Secretary of State, Colin Powell, who must constantly defend his position against Cheney, Rove, and Rumsfeld. Toby Jones plays Karl Rove and is not given as much emphasis as I would have expected. As far as I can tell, Karen Hughes was completely left out of the film. I was not as impressed with the performance of Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice. She seemed stiff and insignificant.
The film does a very good job of revealing how the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction destroyed the credibility of the Bush presidency. At some point George W Bush recognizes that he will go down in history as one of the greatest Presidential failures for taking the United States into a war on false fabricated evidence. The film had to show that President George W Bush was a man who rarely reflected upon his own performance as evidenced by the press conference where he is asked if he made any mistakes in his Presidency, and he responds that he can't think of one. In a presidency that was full of mistakes, this is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film and of the character of George W Bush.",1272067200,,3530,4.739837398373984

I am a moderate Democrat, now living in the Bush clan's old hometown, so my vote will never count for anything again, since my county and city are among the heaviest Republican enclaves in the nation. I did not vote for W, either time, but I thought he handled the initial 911 response well, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt on Iraq, until it turned out bad. This film is more interesting for Stone's take on the family dynamics than it is for the Iraq war planning (deceptions, or well-intended honest mistakes?) James Cromwell, as the elder Bush, is wonderful here. Brolin does a fine job in a hard assignment, depicting a person we seem to know so well. It was interesting to see a younger Karl Rove depicted (he just came to town last week promoting his new book.) Love him or hate him, after watching Mr. Stone's very condensed version of his life, you will think you understand George W. a little bit better. Nobody takes the presidential oath intending to hurt the nation, and it's a job that people who are most qualified for it won't go after, because campaigning is demeaning and demoralizing. The Bush family now claims two failed presidents, and I often wonder if W regrets winning a second term. He proved himself more popular than his dad, for a bit of time, but in the end will be rated the less successful leader. This movie reminds us that these famous people once were young, and made lots of ordinary mistakes, before they got the power to make extraordinary errors. You can't help but feeling a bit more compassionate toward the younger Bush when you finish seeing this. That may not have been Oliver's intent, but it's my conclusion.",1271721600,,1830,4.531722054380665

3439613,1,B0019LY5IC,"This was a painful and skimmed-over review of the life of George W. Bush.  It's as if Oliver Stone had in mind to capture certain elements of Bush's ""hidden agendas"" while in office, and as the ""brilliant film maker"" he continues to feel that he is, tried to display those agendas through underlying themes within the movie.

Stone probably feels as many Americans do; that Bush is so self-absorbed and narcissistic that he often ""misses the forest for the trees"".  And, that Stone himself would be able to pass an articulate piece of film making by this president as a historic and valuable piece of art, while exposing the Bush agenda and wrongdoings. (Kind of like Frost did with Nixon, only this would be in movie form.)

I was in hopes that his film would rejuvenate my positive views of W.  I voted for him in 2000, but I was certain to not make that mistake again in 2004.  The W Administration was a joke and a blight on the history of America.  I felt that Stone may be able to pull off something less generic and create something more personal so that I may make some sense of this President's selfish, misguided and corrupt antics.

The truth is, this film encapsulated many of the real facts of W's life.  None of which really give him the foundation to make a credible and responsible presidential leader of our country.  W proves to be an uncaring, narcissistic, greedy man that cannot ever admit any wrongdoings.  He proves to be self-righteous, confused about his goals/direction, somewhat insecure, and growing up completely spoiled, as a child AND as a man.

His personal life is wrought with family dysfunction as he lives in his father's shadow.  Sadly, W appears he will accept any sympathy anyone offers him for this kind of family dysfunction. It's a disturbing film when you realize that W probably agreed to this work before its release and potentially feels that this film, in part, may put him in a better light. Or, worse yet, that this film may help distribute and absolve the blame and consequences of his faulty administration.

The undertones of priming Jeb for an upcoming presidential election are quite obvious.  And, I believe at some point during the making of this film, Stone sells out.  I believe that he comes to realize that there is no perfect way to exploit the truths that would expose the Bushes, so he goes with the simplest path; Those that are the generic and obvious truths that the Bush family would have to agree with. And sadly, that is precisely what you get.",1270857600,6,2513,4.65158371040724

I think the first time you see it, it rankles your sensibilities.  The more you see this film, the genius becomes more subtle.  It creeps you out, then it creeps back into memory and provokes conversation with others who saw something different.  Maybe a classic!

Oliver Stone has given us brilliant contemplation with all of his movies.  Whatever he does, he hones to a pure, bare revelation of our culture with all of the nuances of our humanity.  It's tough being challenged and I guess unless you have a liberal epistomology, you go kicking and screaming with preset ideals.

Tolstoy said ""the most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already, but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.""

I also admire Stone, he went to Vietnam as an infantryman and received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, and as we know W was busy gassing up his plane here in the States.  I'll stick with Stone!

3439615,3,B0019LY5IC,"What holds back Oliver Stone's film recitiation on the life of President George W. Bush from being better is simple: the film was made too soon, while Bush was still in office, and it excludes the final humiliation of his presidency, the decline and collapse of the employment, stock, housing and oil price markets that occurred in the shattering late summer and autumn of 2008, wrecking America's economy and making way for the Obama presidency and the revolution that followed.

There is a certain irony about this film that director Stone, using techniques and storytelling similar to what he captured in his cinematic view of Richard Nixon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nixon-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000063V8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nixon - Collector's Edition</a>, has seemingly mellowed with age.

To say W. is not political would be wrong; but to say it is not sympathetic to its leading figure would be even more inaccurate.

A second irony is in the casting.

Unlike that film, where Judy Davis's portrayal of the first lady stole the show, the younger Brolin is the star here, delivering the goods as if the real W. were the handsome Hollywood actor we see on film, DVD and television.

Assembling a group of veteran Hollywood stars to fill the critical roles around President Bush -- that includes Richard Dreyfuss as Vice-President Dick Cheney, Scott Glenn as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Thandie Newton as Condaleza Rice and Toby Jones as Karl Rove, the conscience and political mentor of the president, the film goes far to re-enact the days of decision-making prior to the second Iraq war in 2003 and the misguided beliefs about weapons of mass destruction the country was alleged to hold. It is the realization that, after war began, the Bush administration learns there never were such weapons in the country that is the president's disgrace and the film's abrupt and untimely end.

For W. is an incomplete film, must as much as that class you took in school were you dropped half way through because of illness and never completed, getting the I on your report card. For it was the summer and autumn of 2008 that defined the presidency of George W. Bush, just as much as it was the recession of 1991-92, and not the success of the first Iraq war, that defined his father's presidency.

Another disappointment for me was the film's failure to address development of the ""Bush doctrine"" that was not borne in the White House by the Bush team, but was birthed in the office parks of Washington and suburbs by non-elected pundits and consultants. The film led one to believe W. was in control of events and policy. Whether true or not, the full impact of those policies, including the policies that led to deregulated financial markets that destroyed the housing and stock markets in September 2008, is what's not in this movie.

I've read the memoirs of many of the central players in Stone's cast, CIA Director Geo. Tenet, Colin Powell, Undersecretary of Defense Feith, former CINCs. While I disagree with them on various points, none of them seem to differ on Bush's persona.  He was not retarded, as Stone portrays him.  They all say he was business, very presidential.  Watching this utter craphole of a movie, I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch, something Lorne Greene would give us.  Yes, it was that silly.  I was embarrassed for Oliver Stone, embarrassed for everyone in it.  When the actors in it went to the premier and saw the edited version for the first time, they surely must have walked out with jackets covering their heads, it was that bad.  Thinking there might be something worthwhile in the commentary, I watched it again with Stone's comments running... and he pretty much spells out his entire liberal philosophy on life.  Contrary to what reviewer ""Jon"" would hv you believe, Stone doesn't put a conservative spin on anything, far from it.  Stone launches into liberal diatribes while at the same time admitting he doesn't really know the man, says he and his writer, Stanley Weiser, are just guessing what he's like, making scenes up, taking dramatic license, fabricating dialogue from thin air.. saying stuff like, ""I thought doing the two scenes on the toilet shows us the real George Bush, a man who has no home.""  That's not a dignified or respected director's work, that's a sophomoric high school student trying to be funny in a class project short.  And that's the way the whole film comes across, sophomoric and high school, only with a larger budget.  At the end, Stone says the Administration was a failure not only to liberals like himself but also to conservatives, with the budget deficits and destroying of the Constitution..  Wonder what Stone thinks about the Obama Administration which really is destroying the Constitution and is running a larger deficit in 1 year than Bush's 8 years.  What will Stone's take on the Obama White House look like?  Probably a cartoon entitled B. HUSSEIN O. with three scenes of Pres. BO on the toilet.  Save 2 hrs of your life, there was nothing redeeming about this movie. The acting was particularly strained, cardboard, and awful by all, EXCEPT for Keach who masterfully plays the preacher with the hairlip, and the guy who resigns at the Pecan Pie meeting - who was hired for that one scene and was the only believable actor in it.

  Oliver Stone was able to get an all-star cast for this film.
  Josh Brolin portrays ""George W. Bush"".
 Bush soon to have a father who will become the Vice President of the United States and eventually The President of the United States, just got himself into some trouble after a football game. He calls his father, George H. W. Bush (James Cromwell) to help him out of jail. Congressman George Bush already has his hands full with Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Doro. ""Poppy"" will help him this one last time. George must be one honky-tonk, hell-raiser of a young man.

  Destiny would prevail.
  In 1977, George W. decides he wants to run for Congress in Texas. Later that year
at a barbecue, he meets the lady of his life, Laura Welch (Elizabeth Banks).
  He loses the election.
  Four years later, he marries Laura.
  After turning 40 in 1986, he gave up alcohol and decides to help his father, who has been Vice President since 1981, campaign for Presidency.
  He wins the election, but only becomes a one-term President as he loses the re-election in 1992.
  It is at this point that George W. decides to change his entire life around with Laura by his side.  He wants to run for Governor of Texas.  His father and mother, Barbara (Ellen Burstyn), disapprove as they want to concentrate on Jeb who is running for Governor of Florida.  George tells his son, ""one Bush at a time"".
  George W. decides to start a campaign anyway.
  Both Jeb and George won their office.
  This all leads to George W's historical bid for Presidency in 2000.

  Josh Brolin in some scenes really nails the mannerisms and voice of George W. Bush. If you were to look away from the screen, you might think you were listening to the real person.

  Stacy Keach as ""Rev. Earle Hudd"" blew me away with his performanace. I have never seen him in such a role before.

Josh Brolin does a very nice Bush Jr, and James Cromwell does a nice job as his father, the whole cast does a nice job actually, and director Oliver Stone, though I refuse to sit thru Natural Born Killers, does a good job here, though I'm not sure
what he's doing here, but I'm pretty sure it isn't a satire. I'm hoping it's mostly the truth, as to how he went from alchoholic to team player, to 43rd US President.
His father-Bush senior, in this film anyway, was always criticizing him into his middle aged years, I had/have a fatherly figure, in the form of my g-pa, so I can understand why he had a hard time loving his dad, although mine was mia half the time.

3439620,2,B0019LY5IC,"So I watched W., and I'm torn.

Josh Brolin's protrayal of George W. Bush during the White House years is compelling and almost spot-on. However, his portrayal of the younger man is tooth-jarringly awful, with a broader accent and attitude that makes him look less like the spoiled, arrogant rich boy we know he was (and is) and more like a high-functioning mentally retarded inbred hillbilly. After fifteen minutes I went back to the start of the movie, keyed on the subtitles, and set the audio to the director's commentary so I wouldn't have to hear that voice.

More to the point of the movie itself, on reflection I'm stunned but not surprised that every character other than Bush is a cardboard cutout. Cheney is an oil-obsessed Machiavelli dedicated to empire; Rove is a toady more interested in winning elections than in any actual governing; Powell is the ineffectual voice of sanity in an otherwise wholly incompetent Bush administration.

George H. W. Bush is possibly the most cardboard cutout of them all. The keynote of Oliver Stone's portrayal of Bush is that Dubya hates his daddy- resents him for being a better athlete, a war hero, more intelligent, and more successful in business. As such he decides to be everything the elder Bush is not- stubborn and inflexible (""strong in spirit""), confrontational, and dogmatic. In support of this, we only see Bush I as a man disappointed in his son, but unwilling to actually discipline him or even confront him about his youthful excesses or his adult incompetence. There is no sign of '41's positive qualities whatever. Apparently, in Stone's view, the fecklessness of the father created the irresponsible, arrogant man of privilege we know today.

Add to this the utterly superfluous and nonsensical bits of ""cinematography"" Stone throws in- three fantasy scenes in a baseball field, Dubya nearly choking to death on a chip, and a ""mystical"" scene on a jogging trail shot by someone deep in the throes of an LSD trip- and the film is, put mildly, deeply dissatisfying.

Stone claims to have done deep research for this film, and a short feature packed with the DVD should be an introduction to any course on what was wrong with the Bush presidency. (This short feature was NOT done by Stone himself.) However, for the sake of his message (that Dubya became what he is because people around him were ""enablers"") Stone takes liberties with the facts- including turning Laura Bush from the final factor in Dubya giving up the bottle to a meek woman willing to accept threatened spousal abuse. The frequent use of ""unsourced"" (translated: entirely made up) scenes to advance Stone's theories certainly doesn't help in this regard.

There are aspects of the film worth saving- the frat house scene, the press answers during Bush's first run for governor of Texas, the war room scene immediately prior to the ultimatum, and the ""pecan pie"" scene spring to mind. The potential for both a good and accurate film is in here. Unfortunately, Stone has instead churned out another of his self-promoting films designed solely to prove himself right at the expense of the facts. The only reason that W. stands above the usual level of Oliver Stone films is that, for a change, Stone's theories actually run pretty close to documented facts. This is not JFK II: The Mirror Universe (quite).

3439621,4,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone has never shied away from controversy as any student of films from the last two decades can tell you. Stone has also never shied away from using past Presidents of the United States (JFK, Nixon) for his own dramatic purposes either. Yet Stone choose to make a film about a sitting President, something that hadn't been done before (at least not in name i.e. Primary Colors). So how exactly does Oliver Stone's W. hold up? I'll put it this way; W. is his best film since Nixon in 1995. Why do I say that?

Well to start of Stone has gotten himself one of his best casts. Josh Brolin plays the title role and it is far from a caricature. Brolin's George W. Bush is a fully formed character that while it might not be a dead-on version of the real man is so close at times it can send shivers up the spine. Brolin has the character and voice of Bush done very well though one could argue on how truthful it is to real-life (more on that later). Surrounding Brolin is a whole smattering of excellent actors. First there's Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney who is not only very close to real but also manages to steal any scene he happens to be speaking in,especially the whole ""empire"" speech during one briefing. James Cromwell turns in a memorable turn as George H.W. Bush as does Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Toby Jones as Karl Rove and especially Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush. There are some miscasts though such as Scott Glenn as Rumsfeld and Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice, both of whom seem more suited to Saturday Night Live then to this film. Stone also fails to make use of some of the cast as well, especially Ioan Gruffudd as Tony Blair but the strength of the rest of the cast makes up for this admirably.

W. also has some strong production values as well. While technically a low-budget film by most Hollywood standards (approximately $30 million), Stone makes good use of it. The film takes across the country (and part of the world for that matter) in its locations and it does so without ever feeling cheap in any way. Stone might not have had a lot of money but he certainly spent it well to judge from things like Bush ranch in Crawford or even the White House sets which could arguably compare with those on The West Wing.

And now we come to the controversial part of the film: its portrayal of George W. Bush. It seems that everyone was expecting Stone to portray Bush has either a caricature or has some kind of tyrant. Stone has chosen (wisely in my opinion) to do neither. instead he portrays Bush as a relatively simple minded man who allows others to guide him down whatever path he lets them for the most part. While there are those who would argue this is too sympathetic to Bush I would argue that, at least from I have gathered in reading books like Jacob Weisberg's excellent The Bush Tragedy, that this is a fairly accurate view of the forty-third President of the United States. Even if it isn't do we really expect it to be? To say that we expect the George W. Bush of this film to be true to life is like saying we expect Shakespeare's Henry V to be true to the real life Henry V. You don't watch Shakespeare to see true to life history any more then you should see this film and expect a true to life portrayal of George W. Bush.

However one feels about the way the film portrays its title character, one should admire the film on its other grounds as well. That includes an excellent leading man in the form of Josh Brolin, a good supporting cast and strong production values. Overall the result is Stone's best film in years and one he should be proud of.",1262131200,,3611,4.393124065769806

3439625,3,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone brings his undeniable talent to this biopic of George `Dubya' Bush.. supported by one of those to-die-for casts he seems to have at his beck and call.  There's no question this is slickly put together, and that Josh Brolin is completely convincing as the title character .... but as a movie experience there is just something missing.
Stone presents Bush as a follower rather than a leader.  Someone who is driven by being under the shadow of his brother in his parents eyes, and whose political drive to succeed is a mirror of his drive to succeed in his father's eyes.  Surrounding him, we have a veritable who's who of Hollywood acting as all the well known string pullers behind him and around him - most of whom are thinly drawn, not being the centre of attention - but of all of them, Richard Dreyfuss does a surprisingly good job of fleshing out Dick Cheney.  There's a little jolt of energy whenever he has a moment on screen, particularly sparring with Colin Powell.  But these are asides, with W's evolving character being the focus, and so as the movie goes on, we see Bush at different times of his life.  From College pranks through trying to find a job he wants to keep, meeting Laura, becoming born again (watch out for a great Stacey Keach turn) and starting his political career.. all told non linearly, interspersed with the period of time that will dominate his place in history - going to war with Iraq.
With all those fine ingredients however, it seems that something has been left out - some excitement, some dramatic hook to draw you in.  Frankly, Bush's life, rather like his presidency some would argue, is rather dull.  In the end, the enjoyment of the movie is in the details.. enjoying watching for Hollywood well known faces playing political well known faces, learning a little about Dubya's earlier life.  But we don't come away much richer for the experience.  Stone's interpretation of the man is valid, but never feels insightful enough or definitive, neither does it have the cinematic or dramatic energy of, say, `Nixon'.  It's not a disaster, but neither does it sparkle.  Sometimes interesting, never fascinating.  Perhaps it is too soon, and looking back in twenty years or more this will be regarded in higher esteem.",1258675200,,2270,4.745547073791348

Now as for Thandie Newton's portrayal of Condoleezza Rice.  Some say it was awful and cartoonish.  I would agree to a certain extent.  It made Rice look subservient and dumb.  But the characteristics of Rice was quite accurate with a touch of being over the top.  You'll definitely catch it and actually made me laugh.  But maybe that was the premise of the movie.

The film depicted the former President as a very compassionate individual with the ability to connect to people all across the nation. Also, the film does display moments of where the Former President has his doubts and encounters situations that puts him in a position of uncertainty, such as the ongoing war with Iraq. Iraq was primarily the main focus of the film as it displays how the Bush Administration had dug themselves in a hole with false reports of WMDs being possessed in the middle-east and how they have managed to lose the public opinion on the the war itself.

3439641,5,B0019LY5IC,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a Republican nor did I vote for either Bush.  So I started off viewing this movie expecting to see W skewered.  I am pleasantly surprised that did not happen.  Instead, I saw a complex portrait of the shaping of a man and a president over many years.  I won't go as far as to say I am now sympathetic to Bush but I understand him and his choices better now. First, I was surprised to see how poorly W wore the Bush mantle.  It was clear that everything W did was less than his father or grandfather or brother Jeb or any other Bush had done.  He couldn't fail to miss this as his parents told him this constantly.  What Bush senior failed to see though was that W could get in touch with the common man yet hold onto the elitist ones with some very conflicting personality traits.  He became a born again Christian as a way of coping with his substance abuse problems.  Somehow he managed to blend being born again with being a guy who had been to all the right schools, joined all the right clubs and gravitated to all the right people for his time in history. His parents were repelled by some of his choices: his being born again set up their Episcopalian backs plus his use of the death penalty repeatedly as governor of Texas was not something they'd want sitting in their own personal biographies.  Clearly, Phi Beta Kappa Jeb who behaved like a true Yale man was more the Bush son they liked to embrace.  Yet the very way W talks in his down home voice, loves baseball and follows it religiously, is a guy anyone would ""like to share a beer with"" and is the life of the party at any frat party or down home barbeque--all of this serves W very, very well with the voters.  In short, he is not off putting like the rest of the elitist Bushes. W seems to genuinely love his country and wants to restore it to bigness.  He goes about this more like a guy who owns a baseball team than a President, which is actually what he did for a living and what he loved doing.  Thus, by the end of the movie when he is in the outfield with his mitt, eternally ready to catch that long baseball hit, the look on his face is one of total all out bewilderment. He is also entirely alone out in the outfield.  This is W by the end of his presidency in a nutshell.

Actually, W's underlings come off a lot worse than he does in this film.  Right at the top of the heap of awfulness is Richard Dreyfus playing Cheney and, boy, does Dreyfus nail Cheney as a character.

I should have realized Oliver Stone could pull this off.  Josh Brolin does a heck of a job as W.  He has become an incredibly fine actor and I am looking forward to each and every performance of his.  I liked this movie the first time but I thought it was terrific the second time. Oliver Stone rarely disappoints as a film director.  A lot of people detest him but they fail to view him solely as a film director, rather than as an obnoxious personality in real life. He shoots himself in the foot every time he opens his mouth off set and would do himself a big favor if he stopped giving interviews.  As a director, he is still one of our finest talents.

3439642,4,B0019LY5IC,"I never cared for George Bush. He just didn't seem to take his job as President seriously. When Katrina was happening ,and our economy was in the crapper, he seemed to be walking around carefree. And what was up with all of his winking and smirking when talking about serious issues? Was he just dumb or plain evil?
Oliver Stone goes with ambitous yet not so bright. A guy that hangs out with power hungry lunatics looking for a patsy at their beck and call.
His Bush plays like a Forrest Gump ,(only with less heart)who by several strokes of luck and lots of dirty work by his minions becomes Governor of Texas ,then President.
I have to say this is not what I expected from Oliver Stone. I thought for sure Oliver would make mincemeat out of our former potus. But instead , he does a character bio of rich kid who is always in the shadows of his father and his successful younger brother. All this Bush wants to do is succeed at something without his father's help. The soundtrack is pitch perfect. He even uses an old Alan Jackson song called Chattahoochie.
Josh Brolin really crawled into Bush's skin and played him well. But Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney is downright scary. Dreyfuss wasn't alotted much screen time, but whenever he was in a scene , he pounced on it , like a shark in for the kill.

3439643,4,B0019LY5IC,"The Bottom Line:

The spiritual successor to Stone's ""Nixon"" (and a better film, in large part because it's an hour shorter), W. is a surprisingly empathetic biopic that follows the classic Greek tragedy form of a man undone by his flaws--in this case, that he's just not smart or strong enough to be President--to tell an interesting, if probably largely fictitious story; if you're interested in Oliver Stone or the Bush presidency the film may be worth looking into.

3/4",1248998400,,474,4.9125
3439644,2,B0019LY5IC,"The basic problem with the film's narrative is that it simply goes nowhere for no reason, and this is summed up in the film's final dream scene- and the film is so pointless that my iterating its end will not matter one iota. W. dreams he is playing centerfield for his old baseball team, the Texas Rangers. A ball is hit, he runs back to the centerfield wall to catch it, as he did in an earlier dream scene. Except, this time the ball never comes down. W. just looks up into the heavens with a goofy look on his face, clueless as ever. While the ending may simultaneously capture the real confusion of the real President as well as Stone's caricature, it also recapitulates the superficial glibness of Stone's whole film. It is shallow, dull, and cannot even induce the hatred inspired by the real W. Yet, even if one accepts that there is no `there' there, inside of the President, could not Stone have at least turned his guns on the American electorate for electing such an idiot? In an earlier film of Stone's, Natural Born Killers, Stone really tore the American consumerate a new hole. Granted that film was over the top where this film is too reserved, even as both are broad in their portraits. But Natural Born Killers, at least, had balls, and skewered the average American. W., by contrast, is a eunuch, and Joe Average gets off as easily as W., the real man, has.

  That stated, the two extremes mentioned in those two films are not the only way Stone could have gone. As example, look to Nixon, and the scene where Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) forces Secretary Of State Henry Kissinger (Paul Sorvino) to pray with him during the Watergate tumult. Now, if there were ever two real men ripe for parody (especially at such a moment) it was Nixon and Kissinger. Yet, the scene, as played and filmed, is actually quite moving. Granted, part of this is because Hopkins and Sorvino are great actors, whereas Josh Brolin and the bulk of this film's cast are not. But, the screenplay was also far better, and showed Nixon as a complex if base, man. W., by contrast, is the aforementioned cipher, and, given that so much of this film relies on the fact that its audience will know much of the political minutia, for having lived through these years, this does not bode well for future viewers to whom Bush's usual suspects will seem bizarre creatures from another dimension.

  Often, in art, a work of art is esteemed as great, not because it is technically, aesthetically, nor creatively, great, but merely because it represents a great break, or a great step forward, from what the art form offered before. What it does is not as important as what it symbolizes or represents, ideatively. Examples of this can be seen in the rather rote epopee of Homer and Virgil, the bloated religious didacticism of Dante or John Milton, the predictable comic convolutions of Charles Dickens, or some of the lesser works of Cubism, or any other school of art. Oliver Stone's latest film, W., oddly seems to invert that truism. It is a regression from not only Stone's earlier, greater films, but from satire itself. It also represents a regression for Stone even as the film is, on the surface, more entertaining than his recent offerings. But, this is a man capable of greatness, and a greatness of Shakespearian levels.

  This film's failure, then, most likely is Stone's unwitting admission that his slow descent into irrelevance and artistic anomy will be unabated. The same thing has occurred to other great American filmmakers like Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese (despite his recent `career' Oscar for The Departed), but it makes it none the less sad and frustrating for his viewers. If only he had shown the nerve to try, this time out, one might have been able to forgive him his failure. But, Stone's own uninspired direction and effort can only elicit a shrug from fans of his work. Like breeds like- a point Stone seems to have wanted this film to make, but....yawn.",1248825600,,3992,4.683309557774607
3439645,2,B0019LY5IC,"W was about as bland as a movie can get. There was very little in it to capture my interest. To be fair, making a film about a contemporary president is bound to be difficult. First of all, there is the unsurmountable problem that everyone has first-hand experience of your subject, which means there's nothing you can say that your audience doesn't already know. Second, there is the specter of lawsuits, which means there's nothing you can say that your audience doesn't already know.

But (seriously) the third and most serious obstacle to making a film about an outgoing president is that it's an impossible undertaking. Current history, as we live it -- with all its emotional charge, its controversy, and its still warm bodies -- is always going to trump its representations, even one made by Oliver Stone. Moreover, there was no emotional punch to Stone's characters, which meant that there was no punch to the movie, much less a point. (""Ex-alcoholic, spoiled, not-too-bright, frat boy with an inferiority complex, money and a good memory for names becomes president"" is an observation, not a point.) Without emotional depth or intellectual content there simply wasn't a story.

And that, dear readers, is probably the best summary of both Oliver Stone's imitation ""W"" and the real one.",1247097600,3,1294,4.986111111111111
3439656,3,B0019LY5IC,"There are two ways to evaluate this movie: 1.) for its political message, and 2.) for its entertainment value.

In regard the first item: Oliver Stone has been making movies and spouting his political views in public since the mid-1980s. His political views are a mishmash of boilerplate 1960s liberalism and snide Hollywood elitism. Therefore, it wasn't difficult to predict that W. would be a one-sided partisan piece peopled by crass, venal Republicans and simpleminded evangelical Christians. Stone hit every point on the checklist in this regard: G.W. was consistently portrayed as comically stupid. During several of the White House scenes, I expected Rumsfeld to wink at the camera and let loose a cartoonish bwah-hah-hah! at any moment.

If you share Stone's view of the world, you will no doubt cheer through W. As a conservative voter who *didn't* care for the Bush Administration, I found many of the movie's caricatures to be over the top.

For example, in one scene Bush is uttering inanities while he sits on the commode. In another scene the president clumsily chokes on a cracker and falls to the carpet. It seemed that Stone could not decide whether he wanted to make a serious movie or a two-hour SNL skit.

Oliver Stone's movies have always been liberal and controversial; but the director used to deliver his blows with greater subtlety and artistic integrity. Consider ""Born on the 4th of July"": This movie contained an unmistakably partisan message; but it didn't insult the audience's intelligence.

Also, Stone used to focus on story first and politics second. Whatever your opinion about U.S. involvement in Vietnam, you can't help but be captivated by the storyline of Platoon. W., on the other hand, was no dramatic tour de force. A handful of the scenes (mostly those dealing with the 2003 invasion of Iraq) descended into transparent political preaching; and that doesn't make for a great movie.

So why did I give the movie three stars instead of one or two? The non-White House portions of the movie are quite entertaining. The scenes depicting Bush's early years as the ne'er-do-well scion of a wealthy family are engaging---and probably reasonably accurate. (In fact, the movie would have been far better if it had focused only on Bush's early years and skipped the ho-hum soapbox routine about Iraq altogether.)

The acting was also superb. One of the most challenging tasks for any actor is the portrayal of a well-known contemporary figure. Josh Brolin mimicked G.W. Bush's mannerisms and facial expressions expertly. The rest of the cast did a fine job of becoming Laura Bush, Dick Cheney, etc.

My verdict is this: If you belong to the centrist majority, watch the movie, but take it with a huge grain of salt. If you are a pro-Bush partisan, this film will only make you mad. If you are a liberal, you don't need this review because you saw W. at the theater and you've already purchased the DVD.

On the other hand, if you are looking for a thoughtful critique of the neoconservative agenda, read ""The Rise of the Vulcans"" by Jim Mann. This book will give you a more accurate and balanced explanation of how U.S. foreign policy went awry in the years immediately following 9/11.",1246752000,5,3218,4.900735294117647
3439657,3,B0019LY5IC,"Regardless of what your opinion is of George W. Bush, this is a fine film. The story of W. is well told, and moves at an agreeable pace for a two hour biopic. The film is clear and engaging. I have high praise for Oliver Stone's direction. He clearly values story over statement. That could have gone the other way with a petty ego at the helm. Stone shows professionalism at every turn during W.

Josh Brolin is simply outstanding as W. He has the voice and mannerisms nailed. Brolin dances skillfully between cowboy, carouser and candidate. Stone also went with a side of Bush I've never seen, albeit my exposure has been minimal. This Bush is in-charge all the way and Brolin hammers it home with gusto. We do see a bit of the suspected manipulation from Carl Rove (Toby Jones) and Dick Cheney (""Vice""). Jeffrey Wright is on top of his game as he brings both strength and intellect to Colin Powell. But when all is said and done, Stone wants us to know Bush is the man. For a fabled ""liberal"", Stone is without question fair in the light he casts W. in.

Thandie Newton is spot on as ""Condee"". Rice is a tough read, especially her voice. Newton gets most of it down well. The one drawback to the Rice character, is the feeble nature and ""yes man"" posturing we are expected to believe. Richard Dreyfuss is fine as Dick Cheney, especially when making a point. Dreyfuss' Cheney captures the shrewd West Wing vet. He emphasizes the notion that he has served two Bushes and both are better off for it. I also enjoyed Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush. Again, a stronger and more influential partner than I suspected. Not at all the stay at home `50s type housewife we've been fed over the years.

Throughout the film, I wondered if the `fly on the wall' perspective was accurate. Several scenes left me considering 'inside information' might have made it's way into the script. Perhaps. Whether or not creative license was at play, the story was strong. And no matter what the subject matter may be, storytelling is the most important part of any movie.

3439662,5,B0019LY5IC,"After all the rancor surrounding Dubys'a administration has somewhat subsided, this is actually a fitting ""homage"" to George W. Bush. While this is of course Stone's interpretation of the supposed machinations behind our entry into the War in Iraq as well as a rather candid look at the man behind the man, in all honesty, Stone's vision is not far off what I myself imagined.

For those looking for a scathing review of Dubya, you will be sorely disappointed.  As a matter of fact, I felt a very strong sense of empathy for the ex-president after seeing this and coupled with how VERY classy I think he is behaving these days, regardless of what I thought of his decisions/actions while in the White House, Stone indeed makes him very human and quite frankly George should be rather proud of this depiction of him.

Stone tells the story in a sort of parallel chronology.  He juxtaposes George's wild days with him in serious talks with his cabinet re the Iraq War.  This works quite well because the contrasts are so stark:  one moment we see a guy being dressed down by Daddy Dear for being a perpetual screw-up and then, with him, we are thrown in the midst of very serious talks with the likes of Karl Rove, Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, and Dick Cheney.

The performances (..well,..except maybe one) are spellbinding.  Josh Brolin is positively wooooooooooooonderful as Dubya, Richard Dreyfuss is positively sickening as Dick Cheney (flawless performance, however), Toby Jones works quite well as Karl Rove, James Cromwell paints a much tougher picture of George Sr than the general public has, Ellen Burstyn (who is ALWAYS fabulous) just WORKS Barbara Bush, Elizabeth Banks was just perfect as Laura, and last but hardly least, Jeffrey Wright is simply OFF THE CHAIN!! as Colin Powell.

Indeed the ""weirdest"" performance was that of Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice.  Her performance was eerily reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live skit where Condoleeza was portrayed by none other than Janet Jackson (right after the Super Bowl ""wardrobe malfunction."").  The end result being that even in the midst of some of the most serious conversations about the validity of engaging in a war with Irag, the other players came across most compelling, while Condoleeza Rice's depiction was entirely too comical.  No matter WHAT she said, I burst into uncontrollable laughter.  And to be fair to Thandie, a very decent actress, the Rice character was nowhere nearly as fleshed out as the others and sadly so.  It would have indeed been interesting to get at least a GLIMPSE of just where her head was in the midst of the madness.  This is also the most glaring omission and my loudest complaint because Stone missed a golden opportunity to include a feminine perspective that quite frankly was sorely needed.

Notwithstanding, this was an honest and VERY entertaining look at Dubya - The Man Who Would Be President.  I hiiiiiiiiighly recommend!!!",1243468800,,2942,4.935091277890466
3439663,3,B0019LY5IC,"George W Bush is such a divisive figure I think it is easiest for me to put my cards on the table as a reviewer.  I did not like W. Bush as our 43rd president.  I think he may be judged by historians as one of the worst we have ever had.  With that backdrop, even though I am sympathetic to the many criticisms W. Bush has earned, this movie by Oliver Stone is mediocre at best.  I think the fact so many critics love it just shows their lack of objectivity on the subject.

In this movie, Bush is portrayed as a totally non-reflective, stubborn and extremely hypocritical person of little capability - best at beer drinking and carousing with women or other potential voters.  That may be an accurate portrayal, I do not know.  But what is certain is Oliver Stone never misses an opportunity to transition scenes in order to highlight hypocrisy or provide cheesy background music to ridicule Bush's simplistic foreign affairs perspective (such as the old ""Robin Hood"" theme).  Showing Bush praying after bizarrely arrogant plans to attack Iraq, or showing depictions of Christ just after beer drinking and carousing flashbacks  - these are the exclusive domain of the film maker - Stone in this case. These are so obviously biased and agenda driven, it undermines what could have been a more fascinating investigation.  I do not think Bush is terribly complex, but he is portrayed as a one dimensional idiot and I find that hard to believe about almost anyone. Stone took a definite position in JFK, whether right or wrong, and sold it to the audience, or at least made it fascinating to learn.  Here, he just bashes away on a president he clearly despises.

Why do I bother to defend Bush at all since I think he was a miserable president? Because I think when you are going to treat someone's entire adult life and trajectory of purpose with such disdain, you at least owe it to them to mention any minor qualities you can possibly locate. With Bush, this is easy.  His change of policy and funding to assist Africa with its AIDs and other crises sets a new standard and it will probably be his most lasting good achievement. This is totally absent from the film.  If Stone disagrees with that widely accepted assessment of Bush on Africa, he could have repurposed one of the many ridiculing scenes to explain why. Instead of showing the corruption in the U.N. as part of Bush's reason for not waiting on them in Iraq, or that Iraq had clearly used chemical weapons in the recent past, Stone only portrays Bush's personal bias and agenda over and over.  I believe these topics are more complex than Stone bothers to examine, yet his movie is more than two hours long, plenty of time.

I started out watching the movie with three other people. None of us like Bush very much. Before it was half over two had left because it was boring. The most excellent aspect of the film is the character portrayals themselves.  Each character in the Bush family or administration is very convincing in body language, tone of voice, mannerisms, etc. and that is saying something since they are all so recent in memory.

As for Stone, I think this film will end up being thought of not much better than the president it obviously means to trash without attempting balanced consideration.  Given some more time, someone can make a movie that is not so loaded with emotion.  Mr. Stone should direct his amazing talents more carefully - George W. Bush is not the only one guilty of having a shallow, incomplete axe to grind.",1242950400,,3508,4.609324758842444
3439664,3,B0019LY5IC,"[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.]

Vain because he thought he was the decider and that God had chosen his ear in which to whisper.  Little as measured by his talent compared to others who have held the office.  But more than that, the tragedy of George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, is a direct result of a sociopathic personality that this film was not able to fully capture.

That personality belonged and belongs to Dick Cheney, Bush's prince of darkness-like vice president, a man who was able to manipulate W. as a puppeteer might manipulate a puppet by playing on W.'s vanity and insecurities, and on his vainglorious lust to outdo his father and to shine brighter than his brother Jed.

Or is it George W. himself who has the sociopathic personality?  How can you approve the torture of people to find a justification to invade another country knowing full well that thousands of people will die because of your actions?  Can you tell yourself you are bringing democracy to another land when in your heart of hearts you know that your motive is to be able to run for reelection as a wartime president or one who has just won a war and thereby upstage your father who was not reelected?  I think the question of whether George W. was the more manipulated or more the manipulator has not yet been answered.

This film is curious in what it shows and where it would not go.  We do not see W. as a boy blowing up frogs with firecrackers.  There is no snorting of cocaine.  We see him as a fraternity pledge at Yale ticking off the names and nicknames of his fellows, but what is missed is the significance of the nicknaming for George W., which is to control others through the threat of demeaning them with an embarrassing tag.  We do see how nicknaming allows him to simplistically regard others, as he calls Cheney ""Vice"" (yes!) and slaps derogatory names on foreign leaders who fail to come into his war coalition.  But the psychological essence of calling other people names is to boast a personality suffering from a poor self-image.

So the 43rd president was simultaneously a vain and self-conscious man acutely aware of his limitations, always working to boast himself up.  He went to all the best private schools, knowing of course that only his father's money and prestige got him in, and of course as a C-student felt his miss-measure against the others.  Yet he is that C-student who became the most powerful man in the world, and yet he had no idea how to use his power.  He became isolated and controlled by the office of the presidency and by those in his inner circle.

There is always the danger when making a film focused on a putatively despicable character that you will by showing his all too human attributes and behaviors make him into an anti-hero with whom the audience cannot help but identify.  I'm sure Oliver Stone was aware of this trap, but nevertheless he fell into it.  We see George W. on the John, watching ballgames on TV, in domestic embrace with his wife.  We see his father favoring the other son.  We see George W. fail and fail again, and then we see him give up drinking and become a rousing political success as he helps guide his father's winning campaign for the presidency, as he wins the governorship of Texas and as he becomes president of the United States.  In some ways--at least as far as intelligence and compromised morality goes--he rose from greater depths than perhaps any other American president.

But of course without the intervention of his father and being the son of a powerful man, George W. would probably have amounted to little.  And so his triumph in becoming the 43rd president is tainted by the full knowledge that, as this film makes clear, he couldn't have done it without his father's influence and his father's name.

The real truth of the phenomenon that is George W. Bush lies not in him or the political dynasty he derailed or the shame he brought on America, but in the fact that so many Americans actually voted for him.  He is the product of his times, and these were the times of great moral corruption in America, times in which preemptive war and torture became accepted practice, times in which the Republican Party became the property of people like Karl Rove and Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, Dick Cheney and the neocons, until in 2008 it became a parody of itself with Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber.

Josh Brolin is convincing in capturing the contradictions in W.'s personality while Richard Dreyfuss makes for a surprisingly apt Dick Cheney.  Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush is as pretty as pretty can be, and James Cromwell as the senior Bush is very true to type.  Thandie Newton captured well Condoleezza Rice's quality of quiet, submissive loyalty while being able to keep her hands clean.  The unavoidable weakness of the casting however is that the characters unfortunately do not look enough like the characters we have seen on TV to fool our eyes.

The script by Stanley Weiser, who also co-scripted Oliver Stone's Wall Street (1987), and Stone's direction are competent but undistinguished and a bit shallow.  The right way to make this film in my not so humble opinion is to really show us the evil of George W. Bush, the evil that was tragically the man, and the harm that he did to this country and to the people of Iraq, and to show us how America itself, from the Congress to the media to the pulpit and pew, was manipulated and complaisance in bringing about the tragedy.  Instead Stone and Weiser emphasize George W.'s little guy vain personality and the irony of his rise to power.",1242777600,3,5750,4.609421000981354

Brolin's performance is OK and he does most of Bush's mannerisms fairly well but I failed the understand the need for the cartoonish close-ups Stone gives him throughout the movie or for some scenes like the one showing him having a lenghty conversation with Laura when he's in the toilet (what was the point there ?). Personally I would have been a lot more interested to see what happened in W's own election night rather than in the one his father lost to Clinton but the way Stone handles the meetings between W and his staff in which crucial decisions were discussed in almost trivial and casual ways and which later brougth such dire consequences throughout the world, are more than enough reason to recommend this movie. Most people in the audience will come away from W with the certainty that Jeb would have been a much better president but with the repercusions to the Bush name after these 8 years, it is fair to say it is highly improbable we'll ever get to find out. The biggest WMD shown inthis movie ?: a pretzel. Now THAT was ironic.",1242086400,6,1147,4.519230769230769
3439689,5,B0019LY5IC,"George W. Bush is a man who was unqualified for every single job he's ever held.  This would not be such a big deal if his chosen profession were as a shoe salesman or a bartender, but the job he hoodwinked people into thinking he could handle was none-other than President of the United States of America.

This is an inquisitive film which delves into his hellraising days at Yale (where he seemingly did everything BUT study) on up through to his ascension to governor & eventually president.  I knew about his ""issues"" with trying to out-do dear-old-dad as prez, but I was unaware about the familial jealousies he had regarding his brother Jeb.  Without holding a palavar on Dubya, Oliver Stone has done an impressive job in this film of psycho-analyzing what is perhaps the least intellectual president this country has ever seen.

The casting of the film was quite good, featuring James Brolin as Dubya and Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney.  Dreyfuss carries an uncanny resemblance to the former VP, and they both capture the mannerisms of their characters nicely.  Elizabeth Banks is a top notch actress, but her portrayal of Laura Bush was not ditzy enough for my liking.  This is not a knock on Banks, but is rather a knock on the writers of the film.  If the film were truly accurate, Laura Bush would have been depicted as being as clueless as Dubya more than 1/2 the time.

There are Conservatives who will scream that this movie is a hatchet-job.  They can scream all they want, but they still can't change history. That the incursion into Iraq was a debacle is as clear as our involvement in Vietnam.  The movie doesn't even go into Dubya's blunders in Katrina or his de-regulation & out-sourcing initiatives which led to the economic crisis that we now find ourselves in.  If anything, the film actually makes us a little bit sympathetic to a man who got in WAY over his head.

As a Liberal, I can admit that Jimmy Carter was not a good president.  It amazes me that there are still(!) so many Conservatives out there who want to defend Dubya's reputation at all costs.  Sadly for all of us, the Bush administration was the most incompetent administration since that of Herbert Hoover, and the most corrupt administration since that of Richard Nixon.  George W. Bush was the most ineffective leader of any American president since Franklin Pierce.  This film tells the story of Dubya.  It's not pretty, but it's accurate.",1241913600,8,2435,4.713947990543735

3439692,4,B0019LY5IC,"When I first heard about W., my initial reaction was that there was no way it could be a good movie. Oliver Stone is a good director who has sometimes made great films. However, when it comes to the Presidential movies he's made, JFK and NIXON, his record is atrocious. It's also a well known fact that Stone is not a fan of President George W. Bush and Stone isn't really known for keeping his politics out of his movies. I admit that the trailers for the movie piqued my interest, but instead of watching the movie in theatres I waited until the DVD release to watch the movie. I was very surprised by what I saw.

The movie is not told in a linear fashion and instead see-saws back and forth between President Bush's life. It begins in 2002, then flashbacks to 1966, then flashes forward to 2002, then to 1969, then to 2003, etc. Sometimes such a storytelling device is difficult to follow, but it works well in W. The movie basically follows George W. Bush as he goes from being a rowdy, drunken college student with a famous father to being a meandering journeyman traveling from one job and profession into another until he eventually feels led to enter politics. He becomes the governor of Texas and, of course, ultimately the President of the United States. The portrait that is painted is not one of a man with a hidden agenda and a plan to remake the country and world in his image, but instead of a man blessed with gifts who kept screwing up his life, but finally turned it around and decided he wanted to make the world a better place. It presents us with a man who truly wanted to do the right thing and believed in what he did. It's a very human look at our ex-President.

That's not to say the movie doesn't make fun of Bush, because there are times that it does. The movie spends a good deal of time (probably a third all total) showing Bush's drinking problems and womanizing. There are scenes where the President is talking with one of his staff, particularly Vice President Chaney (Richard Dreyfuss) and it's obvious to the audience that the Vice President is just using Bush to meet his own goals and fulfill his own agenda. In scenes such as these, the Bush is presented as a bumpkin who is in over his head. The movie also tries to present the case that everything that George W. Bush did was to earn the approval of his domineering father, George H.W. Bush. Still, despite the negative aspects the movie shows of his personal history and character, overall the movie presents a complex and interesting view of our 43rd President.

Some elements of the film have been dramatically fictionalized, others taken directly (and at times quoted) from history. Some people might be angered by the mixing of history and fiction, but most great biopics do that. No matter how famous people are or how interesting lives they lived, for a movie things have to be condensed and sometimes in order to connect loose ends an anecdote or scene has to be made up.

In my opinion, the main reason that W. is so compelling is because of the performance of Josh Brolin. Brolin wasn't Oliver Stone's first choice to play the title character, but it should have been. Brolin has proved himself time and time again that he is an amazing actor with an incredible amount of range. His performance as President George W. Bush is flawless. Ever mannerism, accent, and quirk of Bush are replicated perfectly. Brolin is matched in his performance by James Cromwell portraying Bush's father George H.W. Bush. Cromwell's characterization is far from the uncanny performance given by Brolin. However, he does do an excellent job of illustrating how the movie sees Bush Sr. as the foil for W. The only other noteworthy performance is that of Toby Jones as Karl Rove. Rove often is presented in a negative light, but just like President George W. Bush, the movie actually paints Rove in a more positive light--instead of an evil mastermind he's just a wunderkid who's really good at number crunching and reading a political landscape.

Richard Dreyfuss has received all kinds of praise for his portrayal as Dick Cheney, but in my opinion it's horrendous. Cheney is definitely the villain of the movie and Dreyfuss seemed to have taken an intense amount of glee in portraying a would-be criminal mastermind. In my opinion the performance is completely over-the-top. The humanization that Brolin, Jones, and to a lesser extent Cromwell bring to their roles is completely ignored by Cheney. It's not that Dreyfuss isn't capable of such a feat, because he is, but he just chose not do so. As for the rest of the cast, all of the other major performances aren't very good and are just characterizations.

I really enjoyed W. It's a much fairer portrait of President George W. Bush than would be expected from Oliver Stone and it's also an entertaining movie. Sadly, however, those on the political left will probably continue to ignore it because it isn't negative enough while those on the political right will ignore it because they've been led to believe it is too negative. If you can put aside your political beliefs and watch the movie for what it is, I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1240963200,,5183,4.659016393442623
3439693,4,B0019LY5IC,"The idea of watching an Oliver Stone movie without a sever political bias seemed almost impossible to me when I first saw the film with some friends, his reputation alone had already brought heavy accusations of bias from my more conservative friends with my more liberal friends secretly hoping that the ""eventual indictment of his idiotic character"" might come by the end of the film, as the only moderate of the group I was brought along ultimately to render my verdict on its political biases. To be clear there were four republicans and four democrats in the group and like any good swing vote I was wedged between them in the theater. What I saw was something I think that neither party had expected.
The film opens on a scene of Josh Brolin (portraying Bush) playing baseball to raucous cheers in an empty stadium, it is a reoccurring fantasy throughout the film changing slightly as it progresses and depicting a place of both psychological comfort and glory for the character. From there we flash forward to a meeting discussing the future of the War on Terror and the eventual invasion of Iraq, this is largely used to set up the main characters and their current natures, reminding us ultimately of shaped his administration. What is interesting here and as the film progresses however, we see that it truly does focus less on the controversial decisions which would come to shape the Bush White House and more on the nature and character of the former President making it a true profile piece. Documenting his upbringing, search for meaning, decline into alcoholism, and eventual return to god, something that the President has only commented on in vague detail but which the film does an excellent job of depicting without going to an illogical extreme. One of the better aspects of the film is gradual development of his friendship with Carl Rove, Condoleezza Rice, and the other key players who would shape President Bush's early policies, which allows a certain insight into the deep levels of trust he placed in these people and the various ways in which that trust was either proven right or betrayed (as in the case with former CIA Director George Tenet who in a rather somber scene is forced to admit that the CIA's recourses in Iraq were severely limited and lead to the incorrect belief that Saddam had WMD).  Finally the most insightful parts of the film comes in the gradual development of President Bush's relationship to his father and the emotional toll that takes on him. In the end I thought it was an excellent film taking some swipes when necessary but largely retraining itself from descending into a character assassination piece.  The acting is excellent with Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Banks, and Richard Dryfuss all playing their parts to perfection, overall I think that it is defiantly worth seeing for anyone that is interested in developing a better understanding of the culture of the White House and the nature of President Bush.
Now, while the movie was light and surprisingly balanced in its approach but the one thing I couldn't over look and that was the fact that it was released while the President was still in office. In the end this prevented me from ever becoming a true fan of the film as I felt ill at ease with the concept of such a portrayal and the nature of its socio-political impact on the Unites States and the White House, both at home and abroad. At the same time I am willing to concede that had they not released it then that the film wouldn't have received the same box office success it did, with the surge turning Iraq from possible failure to possible success, and the economy in decline and the President heading the efforts to save millions of jobs the idea of a satirical profile piece was becoming less and less appealing. Especially once it became clear that whoever the successor was that the United States couldn't simply turn tail and run from Iraq or Afghanistan and may have to follow at least a portion of the Bush Doctrine out of sheer necessity. This left me in a lingering middle ground where most people I know who saw the film find themselves to this day, the more ardent liberals disappointed in the films more moderate portrayal and unable to exorcise their angst on the big screen  were annoyed at how human the President seemed. While at the same time the more stringent right was bothered by the films progressive humanization and subtle undercutting of a President they had elected and form many continued to believe in. Still as I said before if you want to take a more in-depth look at one of the most controversial Presidents of the last fifty years and perhaps at your own biases I would defiantly recommend the film, just don't be surprised if you're not sure what to think after the credits roll. As a friend of mine pointed out once, sometimes when you go looking for answers all you find is information, this film defiantly fulfilled that statement for much of its audience.",1239753600,,4969,4.728950403690888

When attempting to dramatize well know events from the recent past - especially those involving public figures who are household names and faces - a filmmaker runs the risk of slipping over into caricature and parody if he isn't careful.  This is particularly the case when the subject is someone like George W. Bush, whose twangy folksiness and propensity for verbal gaffes have made him a prime target for mimicry and ridicule on the standup-comedy circuit.  Yet, in ""W.,"" a biopic of the 43rd President, director Oliver Stone and writer Stanley Weiser have largely avoided falling into this trap by providing us with as fully rounded a portrait of the man as one could reasonably expect under the circumstances.  Indeed, those anticipating a slashing satire or a Bush-bashing screed from the left-leaning Stone will be sorely disappointed by what they'll find in this film.  By keeping the cheap shots down to a minimum, the filmmakers allow us to see Bush more as a figure of tragedy than of scorn, a son who could never fully live up to the expectations placed on him by his father and who, as a result, spent his entire life engaged in a kind of Freudian drama of trying to prove himself to the old man.  In W's case, he also had to contend with competition from a younger brother, Jeb, a golden boy who was altogether smarter and more articulate than George, and clearly the apple of their father's eye.

The movie starts off in 2002, just as Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Rice, Rove and Wolfowitz are making plans to ""sell"" the Iraq war to the American public.  Using this time period as his outer framework, Stone then delves into a series of flashbacks stretching all the way back to 1966 when Bush was a frat-boy spending most of his time partying at Yale.  From then on we see him as a largely rudderless young man, drinking heavily and unable to hold down a steady job, always looking to daddy - then Senator Bush - to bail him out of his scrapes.  When he hits the age of forty, he undergoes a life-altering, ""born-again"" religious experience that inspires him to give up drinking.  By stages, we see him turning to a career in politics, losing his first election to Congress, but then picking himself up off the floor and becoming a successful contender for Governor of Texas, surrounding himself with savvy political consultants like Karl Rove, who would ultimately help to propel him into the White House (interestingly, the run for the presidency and the voter debacle in Florida are not documented in the film).

It's true that the movie doesn't have much ""good"" to say about Bush - and even less about Cheney who appears as a Mephistophelean figure throughout, the obvious puppet master pulling the strings in their relationship - but Bush is portrayed more as a victim of his upbringing and of circumstances than as an evil or even ill-intentioned person in his own right.  Much of the success of the film lies in the brilliant performance by Josh Brolin in the lead role.  Not only does Brolin have Bush's mannerisms and vocal intonations down pat, but he makes sure that we see the inner workings of the man beneath all the swagger and bluster.  Brolin's thoughtful, sensitive work here helps us to understand how Bush's dogmatic and stubborn nature might actually be the product of his overcompensating for feelings of inadequacy and a poor self-image.  Of course, it is this very dabbling in speculative psychology that is most likely to drive the president's supporters apoplectic with rage while watching this film, but for the rest of us, such an approach actually makes Bush MORE appealing as a person not less so.

Beyond Brolin, there is fine work by James Cromwell as ""Poppy"" Bush, Ellen Burstyn as his mother Barbara, Elizabeth Banks as his wife Laura, and Richard Dreyfuss as the perpetually smarmy Cheney.  There is only one truly awful performance in the film and that is delivered by the normally wonderful Thandie Newton, who turns Condaleeza Rice into a bizarre combination of twisted facial expressions and ear-grating vocal stylings.

As director, Stone's use of tightly-knit close-ups and a persistent - but not distracting - handheld camera brings a much needed quality of immediacy to the movie as it hurtles  through the years at a near-lightning pace.

The script includes many of Bush's most notorious and fondly ridiculed malapropisms and tongue-tied moments - ""Is our children learning?"" ""Fool me once...you can't get fooled again,"" ""people are always misunderestimating me"" - albeit in settings and contexts different from the ones in which they actually occurred.  Critics of the film might view this as yet another example of Stone and Weiser playing fast and loose with the facts, but the goal of ""W."" is not to provide an etched-in-stone biography of this one specific man but rather a portrait of an individual who engages the audience with his all-too-human frailties and weaknesses.  And at that it succeeds very well.  I can't guarantee how any diehard Bush fan will react to this film, but if you are fair-minded enough to take the plunge, ""W."" may make you see the man in a somewhat different - perhaps even more favorable - light.",1239408000,,5202,4.832207207207207
3439695,4,B0019LY5IC,"Considering Oliver Stone's reputation as an unrepentant Bush-loathing liberal, ""W."", the director's film about our 44th president, is surprisingly well-balanced and even sympathetic as it portrays the failures of both Bush the man and his administration. The fact that Stone considers the man's reign in the White House a disaster does not mean it lacks objectivity. Except for a few partisan republicans, who can possibly look at the wreckage this man has left behind and not reach the same conclusion?

Josh Brolin's performance holds it all together. He may not look much like Bush, but he captures the man perfectly, from his smirk to his swagger, and, of course, his hilariously inept use of the English language. Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney and Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld are also expertly cast. Some of the other players are a little less convincing. James Cromwell is one of my favorite actors, but he's too sincere and likeable for the role of Bush's two-faced father. Thandie Newton, on the other hand, is downright bizarre as Condelezza Rice. She sounds like Lily Tomlin as Ernestine, the loony phone operator (""One ringy-dingy, two ringy-dingy""). But it's nice to see Stacy Keach, sans mustache, as the Reverand Earle Hudd, a composite of several evangelical ministers who supported Bush's presidential ambitions when his own family did not.

Okay, so Stone imagines incidents in the life of Bush, the private citizen and the commander-in-chief, but this is drama, not documentary, and even the best documentaries are shaped by their makers to express a point of view. Like Stone's other political films (""J.F.K.,"" ""Nixon""), ""W."" is the work of a man with more on his mind than box-office success. That alone makes it worthwhile.

3439697,5,B0019LY5IC,"I avoided this movie for a long time, because of all the bad reviews I had heard. What a mistake I made.

People really don't understand this movie. It's not an expos, it's not a Bob Woodruff book, it's not meant to be filed in the National Archives as part of our historical record. It's a character study, an exploration of a man's heart, mind, and soul.

And an excellent one at that. It's a shame people can't put politics aside, and just enjoy the movie for what it is. All of the negative reviewers seem either to want a bloody crucifixion or a whitewashing Adoramus Te. It struck me as an honest attempt to get to know--to attempt to explain--one of the more enigmatic of our presidents.

Further, the editing, acting (for the most part), and cinematography were all excellent. Although it ran for over two hours, the movie seemed to be over before I knew it, and I really wanted it to continue. This is just exquisite storytelling, a thoroughly entertaining movie, and so long as you're not looking to ""learn"" a bunch of ""dark secrets"" about the Bush White House, so long as you do not remain convinced that ""W"" will one day be carved into Mount Rushmore--think of it, in effect, like you would ""King Lear"" or ""Oedipus Rex""--and you will not be disappointed.",1238457600,3,1266,4.543859649122807
3439698,1,B0019LY5IC,"I personally thought that Stone really dropped the ball on this film. ""JFK"" is one of the best political films ever, and ""W"" is more like a extra long version of a SNL skit. The portrayals of W's staff were more parodies than portrayals. Thandie Newton is a great actress ( NOT TO MENTION FINE), but her performance as Rice was pathetic. What was even worse than that one was the one of Powell, Keanu Reeves could have made a better Colin Powell. The rest were almost as bad. All Stone accomplished was taking good actors and making them play bad parts to try and destroy the image of a sitting President. That is obvious to even the most casual observer.",1238457600,4,655,4.421487603305785

sometimes you'll wish Thandie Newton's Condoleeza Rice had less screen time (a lot less) and at some points, you will riveted.

Oliver Stone makes his opinion that Bush was a terrible President very clear, but he also gives the views reasons to feel sorry for him. He presents Bush (accurately) as man overwhelmed and unprepared for the job.
During the most powerful scene of the film, Bush and his Cabinet debate the Iraq war. Stone presents Bush as being manipulated into invading Iraq by Cheney and others in his cabinet. At that moment, one has to ponder
what would've happened if Bush said no. Think about it. Invading Afghanistan was justifiable and he had a very high approval rating. I'm not saying other policies during his Presidency wouldn't have hurt him. But imagine how different things might be if he had just told the cabinet no.

In conclusion, this is one of the best films of 2008. It could've been flawless with a better Condoleeza Rice. Richsrd Dreyfuss should've been nominated for an Academy Award, but since when does the academy know good acting (I mean, other than Heath Ledger, was anyone impressed by the other nominees? I wasn't.).

3439700,2,B0019LY5IC,"Love him or hate him:  George W. Bush is a polarizing figure.  His successes:  the Iraq War, Afghanistan, tax cuts, Supreme Court appointees, a respect for the moral fabric that keeps this country together (but is bursting at the seams:  these are perilous times).  His failures:  massive spending, expansion of the federal government, expansion of Medicare, government bailouts of the private sector, an inability to effectively communicate with the American people....  At the present time, it looks as if George W. Bush could have been a great president....time will tell.

With regard to Stone's movie, however, it's somewhat interesting.  But there are no surprises here.  Bush is caracatured as some buffoon who only achieved his position because of his family.  He's a party boy, frat boy, who eats like an absolute pig.  The conservatives in his administration are lampooned and the liberals (Colin Powell) are lionized as being thoughful and wise.  Again:  no surprises.

The fact is that the movie doesn't really cover any new ground.  It's basically all the hate and vitriol expressed by the left during the Bush years cleaned up (so as to seem ""sympathetic""), dramatized, and packaged for big screen presentation (although it feels more like parts 1 and 2 of the primetime Sunday night movie).

I'll give Stone credit for his initiative in throwing this movie together, but it's certainly a ho-hum affair.  On the upside, Brolin is very good in his caracature of Bush.  The casting is really good:  sometimes I almost thought some of the actors were the people who they were portraying!  Otherwise, a solid 2 star movie.",1238371200,2,1632,5.06015037593985

None of the debates were covered and Bush did well in the debates. George Bush is a very normal, down to earth person but I did not get the feel for that watching this movie. The movie made him to be dumb and inept - and I feel the movie did not treat him fairly. If you watch the movie ""Primary Colors"" which is a story that mimics Bill Clinton's rise to the presidency - it shows his transgressions but also shows his strengths - it was much more balanced. This could have been a good movie but Oliver Stone was more content to take pot shots at President Bush - we certainly know where Mr. Stone stands politically after watching this movie, a failed effort.",1238025600,3,1004,4.234375

3439704,3,B0019LY5IC,"_W._ (2008) starring Josh Brolin is yet another of Oliver Stone's films detailing the lives and presidencies of the American presidents.  W. of course is a examination of the presidency of George W. Bush.  It details his life and early career, beginning with his induction into the ultra-secret Skull and Bones society at Yale, his involvement in various jobs and his attempts to run a major league baseball team.  The film shows Dubya as largely constantly under the influence of his father who he constantly tried to escape.  The film also shows Dubya's struggles with alcoholism, drugs, and women and his eventual conversion and rise to power.  The film then shows Dubya's decision to enter Iraq as president under the belief that WMDs were to be found there and the influence in particular of such advisors as Dick Cheney (the Vice President), Karl Rove, and Condeleeza Rice.  The film does show for example that Colin Powell opposed the war initially but went along with it because of pressure from the other advisors.  The film does not show that Bush I opposed the war as well privately.  However, it does show the problematic relationship between Dubya and his father.  The film attempts to show widescale incompetence in the Bush White House and ends by showing a clueless Bush unaware about the lack of WMDs in Iraq.

It seems that there are two theories of the Bush presidency.  Some see Dubya as stupid and incompetent while others see him as evil.  This film seems to be a farce showing an incompetent president unable to deal with the situation in Iraq.  The film shows how the events of September 11 were used to propel the U.S. into war with Iraq, which had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks of 9/11.

3439719,4,B0019LY5IC,"Like Stones' other biopics of american presidents this is very well crafted. Josh Brolin does a great job starring as Bush jr, and in some scenes he is eerily lookalike. The film alternates between the time just before the invasion of Iraq, and episodes from W:s reckless youth. We get snapshots from the White House, Bushs talks with Powell, Rice, Rumsfeld, Rove and, of course, Cheney. The latter being the important man behind it all is being made clear. We also get episodes from W:s alcoholism, his ""rebirth"" and most important: the relationship with Bush senior. The heart of the story seems to be this relationship, where senior favors Jeb and find Jr hard to deal with, and where Jr feels patronized and so on. Actually I wonder how true this really is, I mean how much does Stone know about this? And isn't it unethical to speculate about another living man's psyche and shortcomings in a major movie like this, even if it it a former president? The events seems a little too recent for that. Of course, Stone doesn't sink to the garbage level of Michael Moore in this, and all in all the portrait is not wholly unsympathetic. Bush is not depicted as a scoundrel or demonised here.",1237507200,,1190,4.644549763033176
3439720,4,B0019LY5IC,"To begin with, I confess that Mr. Stone's other contemporary Presidential biopic, ""Nixon,"" has held my attention and admiration as my third favorite film, ever since I first saw it many years ago. So, it was inevitable that I could be disappointed by this new work, especially without the cinematographer Robert Richardson attached--and yet, I knew better. Here, the subject is G.W., who entered our lives well after the onslaught of epidemic political cynicism and 24-hour news cycles cranked out by media conglomerates. It is in fact Nixon who, Stone argued, marked the beginning of this terrible loss of innocence, making him truly the last great archetype of Greek-tragedy proportions (an aspiration that truly defines Mr. Stone's estimable oeuvre). Adding to that, our sitting President is not an especially nuanced or complicated human being--yet, human nonetheless, and what occurs to me is that any sincere attempt to plumb W.'s humanity could only make him so much more human than the truly villainous figure to whom we attribute countless loss of life and arrogant mismanagement of our centralized government.

That is, to be true, what happens in the film ""W."" And again, if Oliver Stone is accused of obsessing over Greek mythology, here we can see new pangs reminiscent of Arthur Miller with his skill of dissecting the American family. It is widely reported, and all-too-simplistic, that the underlying conflict of this film is Oedipal, as between George H.W. and George W. But what I believe the viewer leaves with, after watching this film, is not any profound intrigue about that relationship between father and son, but rather the inevitable ""Cabinet family"" that creeps onto the prodigal son as he plods into his proof that he is stronger than his father, more deserving of his father's love, more deserving than Jeb, and ""born again."" Indeed, one important discipline I've always practiced during the end credits of a film I care about is eavesdropping, and tonight I heard several iterations of a startling conclusion: Namely, that the message of the film is that G.W. was the victim of a political machine, one that coerced the war in Iraq and numerous other perils that we face today.

Surely this film is a political Rorschach Test, where one political persuasion and the other interprets the film to match their sympathies. But starting from the total wipeout that is G.W.'s disapproval ratings in the year 2008, what I find fascinating is that any competent portrayal of this man's humanity could only endear us closer to him, whatever our persuasions.

There is a central scene in the film, in some kind of war room that I imagine to be under the Ellipse of the White House grounds, wherein the ""war trust"" lay out their case for invading Iraq without international consensus. (To my taste, Colin Powell is depicted with far too much vigilante heroism here, and I say this as someone who worked for his son Michael and always reserved great admiration for his father the elder General.) In this scene, Mr. Stone almost seems resolved to authenticate the very thing that stumped Sarah Palin--the ""Bush doctrine"" which is better punctuated as the ""Bush"" doctrine--giving Cheney and Rumsfeld and Rove and Rice a suspension of disbelief that is not merely literary, but literally tactical. With geopolitical diagrams to boot, the audience is drawn closer to a realization that ""reasonable"" minds could buy the ""Bush"" doctrine, the as-played invasion named Freedom. Without going into too much detail, the scene basically depicts a not-so-scandalous point of view (quite historically ordinary) that America is losing her world domination, yet it would be nice to preserve it by military means.",1237334400,,3715,5.086885245901639

3439722,3,B0019LY5IC,"As Oliver Stone comments -- W. is not really a political movie... its aim is really to get us inside his skin, and see how he came to power... and to that extent, it is meant to be compassionate, since the aim is to get us into his world. And he also comments that he's not a documentary film maker (*well, except for the project that he currently has in production... oops...) Still, buying that, according to him, the film does not have to make a strong political point - - it has to tell a story...

O.K. - - indeed he is right... and to that extent we can understand why the film lacks the intensity of... say one of Woodward's books, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - - or heck, a Michael Moore film... but there's a catch: Isn't the whole thing about seeing an Oliver Stone film that whole ""underlying social/political commentary"" - - the challenging social statements, and the inevitable debate about where the line between fantasy and reality lie, how far Stone crossed it, and whether various scenes are art or sensationalism?
On the other hand, doesn't a director have a right to do something different now and then?
My conclusion: Maybe yes... but the viewer has to understand that when an artist goes outside his own little niche, the genius may or may not necessarily cross over... - - In this case, I think you get his ""chops"" as a director... minus however, the edgy feel of ""inspired genius"". (i.e. this is a nicely done movie, but not a DIRECTOR driven film... you are entering into Bush's world, not Stone's... take it however you wish!)

From this perspective, I'll give you my personal opinion:
To do a non-political film about a character as relatively simple as W. to me, just doesn't work.
Clinton or Reagan minus their political careers definitely would stand on their own...  but to be honest, the DUBYA story MINUS *any* kind of social or political commentary is ridiculous... Note also that since the topic is so recent, the film can't even have the charm of a period piece... say like NIXON (with its '70s pop culture and fashion).

In the end, no strong Statements are made, few of the scenes are jaw dropping memorable... and the premise is simple: We're to feel sorry for this guy, not hate him as reasons for this are demonstrated in scene after ""made for HBO"" scene.

As a final note, Stone pulls together, but under-utilizes (misundermates?) a great cast... however, Josh Brolin does carry the film excellently.

3439724,4,B0019LY5IC,"Who would have thought that Oliver Stone, creator of the paranoid conspiracy flick, ""JFK"", would ever come up with a largely empathetic portrait of our recent president? ""W"" chronicles the life of George W. Bush beginning with his days as a drunken frat boy through his days in the Oval office dealing with the War in Iraq and its aftermath.

""W"" is most successful when we're treated to the 'behind-the-scenes' look at Bush's personality and his interactions with those around him. The most fascinating scenes are the flashbacks which deal with Bush as a young man and his gradual maturation and leap into politics. Josh Brolin does an excellent job capturing the essence of George W. Bush with all his goofy mannerisms. Bush actually comes off as a sympathetic character. Brolin emphasizes Bush's fixation on seeing the world with rose-colored glasses. For Bush, everything is a simple contest between 'good' and 'evil'. His inability to deal with complex issues ultimately leads to policy consequences he's unable to control.

The film is on shakier ground when Stone strays from his tone of behind-the-scenes black humor to heavy-handed political propaganda. This occurs when Stone focuses too much on Colin Powell (who becomes Stone's mouthpiece), with his long-winded dissents over the administration's decision to go to war in Iraq. It's these talky cabinet meeting scenes (particularly in the second half) which slow the movie down. By dealing with dry and familiar political issues and failing to focus on the IDIOSYNRACIES of the characters, one feels as if one is listening to an academic lecture as opposed to viewing scenes fraught with engaging dramatic conflict.

The supporting cast is a mixed bag. Richard Dreyfuss is a dead-ringer for Dick Cheney and does an excellent job of conveying Cheney's 'take no prisoners' philosophy. Toby Jones is less successful as Karl Rove, playing him much 'softer' than he is in real life. I was most disappointed in James Cromwell as George Bush Sr. Whereas Stone made a great effort to have most of the actors resemble those who they were playing, Cromwell doesn't look like George Bush Sr. nor did he make any effort to imitate his voice or mannerisms. Cromwell is better at playing bad guys like in 'L.A. Confidential' or 'Clear and Present Day'; but real life characters need to remind us much more of the real thing. Thandie Newton looks and sounds like Conde Rice but her part is completely underdeveloped. We never get a sense of what she's like as a person (I would have liked to have seen her in a scene where she's playing some classical piano!). Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush was okay but seemed a tad bit too young for the part. Elizabeth Banks looks a lot like the young Laura Bush but she never seems to age by the time she's living in the White House. I thought the scene where W. and Laura meet was quite realistic especially with Laura being depicted as opinionated and not willing to be cowed by W. But she never seems to grow as a character in the later scenes (what about all the talk about trouble in their marriage? Or did that come later?)

One gets the feeling that screenwriter Stanley Weiser had access to a a great deal of personal stories about W. and his family which made the film compelling. But he lacked the requisite behind-the-scenes stories concerning the other characters (particularly the cabinet members such as Rumsfield and Colin Powell, who are just there for the history lesson).

""W"" is an affectionate look at the strengths and foibles of our current president. Oliver Stone is to be commended for examining the life of George W. Bush with empathy which makes for compelling drama. Some of ""W"" is talky and preachy but despite its shortcomings, it's definitely worth seeing.",1236988800,,3770,4.875195007800312

3439736,4,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone's ""W"" had the most uncomfortable effect upon this viewer of generating actual pity for George Walker Bush, a man who has wreaked more destruction and sorrow on the planet than any President in the history of the United States.

My basic attitude toward any Stone film is ""big deal"" without necessarily seeing the film.  I've never understood the OS phenomenon.  Particularly with respect to his ""political"" films, filled with disinformation so far reaching and absurd that one is tempted to call them propaganda.  (The film ""The Doors"" was absolutely awful and a complete waste of a great subject. It's ""success"" is a consequence of the naivete of the viewers and the ""music video"" strain in early 90's film.) ""JFK"" was entertaining in a horror/intrigue sort of way, but at no point was it remotely in contact with reality.  ""NBK"" was just futile depravity shot in really ""cool"" hues of studio light.

This film, though, garners some real respect.  There is not one scene in this move that is sensationalistic or cannot be verified factually.  All one need do is crack open a respected bio(psy) of George W.'s reign of terror to corroborate information. ""State of Denial"" by Bob Woodward was obviously a big influence.

Ellen Burstyn is an actress who has a talent for playing women in some scary/miserable situations.  One recent example is ""Requiem For A Dream"", playing a drug addled mother imbibing speed constantly to avoid acknowledging her son's rapidly escalating heroin addiction.  I maintain that I would rather be the mother of the demon possessed Regan MacNeil in William Friedkin's classic ""The Exorcist"" than the mother of George W. Bush or Bush Sr's wife.  As the woman who once told the press that there was no need for her to waste ""as beautiful a mind as her own"" on the messy business of body counts launched by her husband's insurrections, Burstyn does a fantastic job.  All steel.

The madness of the Bush/Cheney administration is given a by turns comical, depressing, and sad treatment.  Josh Brolin looks nothing like Bush, but he acts *just* like him: the baseless self confident monkeylike confidence in his every word and physical movement, the innocent Texan swagger which would eventually shoulder it's way through the constitution and economy, and, of course, his complete lack of reading comprehension or intelligible communication skills.

Brolin gives a devastating performance as a never truly grown man who makes every wrong decision possible, all in the interest of pleasing ""Poppy"", Bush Sr.  All he wants to do is please his father, also played brilliantly by James Cromwell. Since he has neither the talent, ambition, intelligence or political skills to do so (as his father gently indicates when Bush bullies his brother out of the Florida Governor's election) this becomes his one goal in life.  To be what he cannot be.

When I'd originally heard that Richard Dreyfuss was playing Dick Cheney I laughed. Real loud.  The guy from ""Jaws"" affecting that chilling growl of a voice and hawklike blade of a gaze seemed absurd.  (A little like Tommy Lee Jones wearing a dead racoon on his head as Clay Shaw.) I was wrong.  He pulled it off, and then some.  Cheney casts a dark shadow over every meeting, using every opportunity to push this confused man child's aggressive impulse to ""even score with Saddam"" and thus outdo his father.

And it works.  There's a bit of the ""unholy trinity"" here: Scott Glenn cuts down Jeffrey Wright's reasonable minded Colin Powell at every opportunity, Toby Jones is fantastic as Rove, the power minded minister of propaganda who teaches Bush the four food groups: and then Cheney, who swoops down every attempt at avoiding war like a starving bird of prey biting into his first newly born worm.

This is a chronicle of failure seen through the eyes of the man held responsible for it as unemployment rises and we slide in to a recession unprecedented since the time of Roosevelt. Millions have died in a senseless war.

The last shot is of a George W. Bush in a baseball field while it rains.  He is holding a a glove open, eager to catch the ball.  He doesn't.

I'm sure republicans will only deny most of the films accuracy, but I think we all know this was just a tiny slice of what really went on in that man's world.

And when it really counted, that last chance at catching a home-run ball, the moment eludes him, the ball flies over his head and all he can do is sit there and look dumbfounded.  Such as his 8 years in office.  This film confirms my belief that George Bush really was a terrible man and comes from a spoiled arrogant family that seems to think they are entitled to the world on a platter.  Humble he was not which is a contradiction to his religious lifestyle.  This film is a testament to the worst presidency our country has ever had the misfortune to endure.  A special shout-out to the actor who played Colin Powell.  There was one scene that added some much needed comic relief when he told Cheney to f@#$ off.",1236902400,,1764,4.434782608695652
3439740,4,B0019LY5IC,"Put aside your feelings about George W. Bush and his administration (hard, I know, but try) and just sit back and marvel at what Oliver Stone and his stellar all-star cast have been able to achieve here.  Despite an anti-Bush sentiment, Stone has produced a surprisingly compassionate portrait of our 43rd President, focusing on the central force driving him--the strained and prickly relationship between the ne'er do well son and his remote, super-competent father.  Stone theorizes that the younger Bush was driven to the White House in a quixotic quest to prove to his father that he could, finally, make good.  Considering that W.'s Presidency has ruined the political influence of the Bush dynasty for generations to come, it only highlights the inherent pathos of the man who, even after ascending to the highest office any human being can hold, still labors in the paternal shadow, and worse--in the shadow of international scorn.

The non-linear narrative begins during an Oval Office meeting to craft the ""Axis of Evil"" speech, and thereafter jumps back and forth between events of Bush's early life as a Yale frat pledge, party boy, job slacker, failed businessman  and drunk to events of his first term leading up to the 2003 Iraqi invasion.  Closed-door conversations are dramatically recreated, but otherwise the plot follows well-documented sources.  The episodic, almost picaresque plot is not the reason to watch, however.  That would be Josh Brolin's centerpiece performance  as W.  He does not so much imitate as channel George W. Bush--though the facial resemblance is slight, the squint, the cowboy swagger, and most importantly, the vocal mannerisms are all there.  I challenge anyone watching this doppelganger of W. to not at times, if only for a minute, forget you are watching an actor and not the genuine article onscreen.  Following last year's career-resurrecting turn in ""No Country for Old Men"", Josh Brolin (whose rocky early career and dynastic connections mirror his subject's own) emerges as an American acting powerhouse, to be misunderestimated as a pretty-boy lightweight no more.  As W., the younger Brolin follows in his father's footsteps by portraying a past Republican President.  (James Brolin played Ronald Reagan in the HBO movie ""The Reagans"".) Had the younger Brolin's subject not been so deeply, brutally unpopular, he might have received a very deserved Oscar for his work here.  Brolin receives support from an all-around excellent cast who embody various figures from the Bush family and W.'s Cabinet.  Much has been made of Richard Dreyfuss' curmudgeonly turn as skew-jawed, power-hungry Dick Cheney (who W. called ""Vice""), and he is very good, indeed.  But the real scene-stealer here is James Cromwell as the patrician patriarch, G. H. W. Bush, who gets off the best lines of the movie as he's remonstrating with Junior about the integrity of the Bush family name.  Also deserving of a singular mention is Thandie Newton as Secretary of State Condolezza Rice, who undergoes a total, vaguely creepy metamorphosis to play Bush's #1 yes-woman.  The diminuative Newton nails Rice's hairstyle, posture, facial expressions, and nasally inflections to an eerie degree,  but lacks the elegance of the statuesque Rice, and subsequently the screen presence to make her Rice more than a rather cruel caricature.  Still, it's amazing to see this tiny British thespian transform herself into a completely different woman with the aid of some pretty fantastic makeup effects.  The rest of the cast hardly puts a foot wrong in their respective roles.  Bravura turns all around.

At the end of this journey with Stone and Co., you may still be infuriated about the Bush years, but hopefully you will gain at least a little more illumination about the flawed yet driven individual at the center of it all.  Regardless of your political affiliations or your opinion of previous Stone movies, I call this one a don't-miss for the performances alone.",1236729600,,3985,5.169781931464175
3439741,4,B0019LY5IC,"I will say this for Mr. Stone; he is a very brave man.  He's known as one of our most controversial directors and he continues to push the envelope, not only with subject but also with construction.  Because of that he is a very `love him or hate him' kind of director.  Look at his work on films like `World Trade Center', `JFK', `Platoon' and `Natural Born Killers'.  These are all films that are so strongly opinionated and controversially designed that the illicit in the audience a reaction of acceptance or repulsion.

Case in point; I hated `World Trade Center' yet I consider `JFK' to be one of the strongest character biopics I've seen.

So, continuing his quest for offence, Stone decided to make a biopic on the man we all have grown to unabashedly condemn as the single worst human being brought into power in the history of the world.  Okay, so not everyone feels that way; and personally I won't even go there (since this particular subject is such a sore spot) but the general consensus is that Bush hacked up the country.  The fact that Stone wanted to do Bush's biopic is not the controversial part.  What is though is the fact that Bush was still serving as President when the film was released.  He didn't even wait for the term to end before he jumped in the director's chair and publicly critiqued the man's life.

He may have been the most hated, but technically he was still the most powerful.

Well, after seeing the film I can finally weigh in on how I feel Mr. Stone has done.  Stone and I have had a rocky past.  I've publicly denounced his seemingly vapid attempts to shed light on the atrocities of 9-11 or his attempt to humanize a certain rockstar, and yet, as I mentioned, he floored me with his powerhouse of a film called `JFK' and a recent viewing of `Platoon' has cemented the film in my soul.  So, lets say that I was excited to see what he could do with Bush, yet I wasn't getting my hopes up too high.

I liked this much more than I thought I would have.

Stone was smart in his construction here, which totally helps with the films pacing and storytelling ability.  Instead of telling the story chronologically, Stone opted to tell the story in vignettes that shift back and forth from college years to Presidency to his time as Governor.  This way the film always stays engaging.  I was shocked, but the film also never felt confusing, which sadly can happen with this style of storytelling.  The script is centered enough to keep the focus grounded and keep our attention.  I'm not a very political person and even I understood everything that was going on.  The inspired casting is also a huge bonus.  Much has been said of Brolin's performance, which is close to perfection here; but he isn't the only one.  Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell and Toby Jones all deliver understated yet powerful performances (Newton may have nailed her character, but she does so at the expense of the film, creating a caricature as apposed to a genuine person), especially Cromwell who embodies Bush Sr. with a sense of self-centered sympathies needed in aiding ones understanding of Bush Jr.

So, with that said, Brolin delivers the performance of his career as President George W. Bush.  What is so impressive about this film is that while it never condones any of the horrific decisions Bush made, and it in no way shape or form paints him to be an intelligent or considerate person, it allows the audience to sympathies with the man's very human issues.  We see him being manipulated by the people around him and his genuine feelings.  Whether he is striving for his father's approval (I felt the films opening and closing with Bush in the roaring baseball stadium were perfect symbolisms of his desperation for acceptance) and struggling to find his own voice amidst the suggestions of others (that last press conference is a sublime example of this man's utter loss of individuality), `W.' paints Bush as a man, plain and simple.  No matter what your feelings are on this man and what he has done to the world, Stone delivers a sympathetic look at what could have led things to go as wrong as they did.  I was very impressed with this because it would have been very easy to spend two hours condemning a man for his mistakes.  Instead, Stone chose to point them all out yet he (along with Brolin) give this man enough of a soul that we can almost sympathize with his failure.

What is so commendable about Brolin is that he doesn't just deliver mimicry but embodies this man with passion and uncovers who he really was, or at least who Stone perceives him to be.

So, regardless of how accurate this one is (Stone has always been more intent of delivering his personal interpretations, which is what any visionary director SHOULD do) it is still a very insightful, enlightening and engaging portrait of a man we all think we know.  It has its flaws (some of the scenes can feel like a series of overlong conversations strung back to back) but it also has its shining moments.  If you can take the good with the bad (or visa-versa) than this is a film you should see.",1236643200,,5098,4.56985698569857

It is hard to dispute most of the scenes laid out in the movie because not even the political figures portrayed in the movie did that. One can learn a lot about inner workings of the very secretive and incompetent government that ruled this country for the last eight years.

This movie is dreadful, it is as if Stone was picked on by some bully kid named W. in elementary school and has sworn revenge. He offers ""insights' that he could not possibly know and plays the Bush family as a bunch of power mad zealots with George W. as a buffoon and George H.W. as a whiny weak man. Stone clearly has an agenda here, He shows Dick Cheney and Karl Rove as the puppetmasters controlling the BUsh administration and Condeleesa Rice as an Uncle Tom-ish character. This is a hatchet job if ever there was one. W. may not have been the most articulate of statesmen but he was never mean, this depiction is just plain mean spirited and unwarranted, and most importantly it isn't even good film making.",1236384000,20,823,4.530201342281879
3439746,4,B0019LY5IC,"Like 1995's ""Nixon"", ""W."" is a character study of a disgraced conservative president by the famously leftist Oliver Stone that is fundamentally sympathetic to its subject's emotions but unsympathetic to the President's actions. ""W"" doesn't have the depth or nuance of ""Nixon"", however. Written by Stanley Weiser, the film was shot in only 46 days. Stone calls it a ""trim-down movie"" in which scenes and procedures are simplified and sets less elaborate than they would be in reality. The film takes us through George W. Bush's adult life, starting in 2002 with the President's preparation for his ""axis of evil"" speech and backtracking to his college days at Yale. It proceeds in this way, alternating between preparations for the Iraq war and Bush's earlier life until the two converge.

""W"" draws on books written about the 43rd president to present George W. Bush (Josh Brolin) as the black sheep of the Bush family, a man driven to take on more than he can handle by his need to impress his disapproving father (James Cromwell), but constrained by a critical lack of intellect: An amiable imbecile who easily falls prey to less amiable men, like Vice President Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) and Karl Rove (Toby James), who need to put a friendly face on their sweeping agendas. Josh Brolin's performance is adequate, but I felt it relies too much on mannerisms. The supporting cast is generally impressive, but Richard Dreyfuss deserves special mention for his interpretation of Cheney's overbearing self-belief. Although the film clearly sees Bush as incompetent and his inner circle as lunatic, there is a darkly comic undertone to their conversations. It's making fun of these people.

The DVD (Lions Gate 2009): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (1  min), a documentary by Sean Stone called ""Dangerous Dynasty: The Bush Legacy"" (17 min) which interviews people about the increasingly authoritarian Bush presidencies. There is a feature commentary by Oliver Stone in which he speaks mostly of George W. Bush's life and what he chose to include in the film, but some about the performances and filming. If you're interested in the film's source materials, the disc is a DVD-ROM (Mac or Windows) containing a ""Filmmaker Research and Annotations Guide"" in PDF. This is 108 pages of annotations and sources (books, articles, television, press conferences, etc.) for the scenes and ideas in the film.

W's a constant disappointment to his father, never measuring up to daddy's high standards. Maybe it is Oliver Stone's telling but when he presented Cheney, Rumsfeild & Rove I got a slight whiff of Goering, Himmler & Goebbels. Albeit on a much smaller scale, Germany & The United States both launched a war based on lies & a false pretext. They both participated in illegal & massive surveilance of their own citizens. They incarcerated & held innocent people without due process. These people couldn't even rise to the level of POW's. Let's not forget interogations & torture. Very Gestapo-like. When you think of the German Army, you think of Blitzgrieg. Our signature move was ""shock & awe"". Not exactly the same, but you get the idea. The movie shows that W is not really stupid. He made it thru Yale & Harvard although Poppy helped. He had no intellectual curiosity & never had an original thought. He had Dick Cheney & Karl Rove for that, suggesting evermore egregious actions. He was a fast learner. He learned dirty politics in his first & only losing campaign, for congressman. According to Mr. Stone, he was reponsible for the Willie Horton ads (with Rove's help). His father won. These type of tactics helped him to the Govenorship of Texas & later to the presidency. These are mostly events we lived through.

The cast is extremely strong, especially with Richard Dreyfus channeling the essence of Dick Cheney.  Josh Broland as W. turns in a masterful performance.

Many more years are needed to offer a fair perspective on the Bush era.  In the meantime, Oliver Stone's over the top ""adaptation"" is entertaining and likely to hold your interest, whether you are a fan of The Decider or one of his detractors.",1235952000,,688,4.788135593220339
3439751,5,B0019LY5IC,"This may not be the George Bush movie that one would expect from Oliver Stone but it is fascinating and compelling nonetheless. He places more focus on the person and less on the policies although they are covered to the degree that someone who hasn't picked up a paper in the last six years would get the drift of what was happening. For those of us who know the history all too well we see these policy meetings, such as they are, with the amount of gravitas that they deserve. For the political discussions Bush is way over his head and baffled and at times doesn't want to be bothered with details. This is accurate to the accounts that I've read about him as a president.

However, this film is much deeper than that, and is not about tearing apart his presidency as one might expect. This is more of a study of a morally flawed, and not particularly bright man who strives out of a necessity to prove his father, George H.W. (played by James Cromwell), wrong about his abilities as a person and his will to succeed. Stone has done a number of films with the father/son theme (Wall Street, Platoon, etc) but this one is different in that it more bluntly confronts the differences and the tensions between the two.

It's a non-linear experience, as one should expect of a Stone film by now. It wades in the less known waters of Bush's life as a younger man who was a party guy, getting into trouble, and being a failure at everything he tried his hand at, all of which was set up for him by his powerful father.
Josh Brolin does a fantastic job portraying the younger Bush as one who doesn't necessarily care about success quite as much as he cares about proving his father wrong by succeeding. Pretty much everything he does is against his father's wishes as he thinks that if G.W. goes into politics that he will ruin it for Jeb who is the favored son.

We know most of the history but Stone presents it all in a compelling way that made me feel as if I were in the briefing rooms with the staff as they later gave Bush information and poor suggestions. Jeffrey Wright does a fantastic job as Colin Powell who seems to be the lone voice in the room against preemptive strikes. The rest of the cast is no less brilliant and it is interesting, to say the least, to see Toby Jones play Karl Rove. The rest of the casting is equally brilliant: Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss), Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn), and Condolizza Rice played by Thandie Newton are all impressive and lend more command and fortitude to the film.

If you think this is a hit piece on the Bush presidency, it is not and you should watch it. It is Oliver Stone's impressions of the man, his life, and his relationships that just happen to have the backdrop of the most powerful political family in the country.

I give it all 5 stars and will watch it again.

3439752,3,B0019LY5IC,"If you expect Oliver Stone to make the George W. Bush into a complex and interesting character in ""W,"" then you will be disappointed.  Considering the subject matter, such an expectation is unrealistic.  Bush comes across as he did for the eight years of his presidency: an unsophisticated, unsubtle and thoroughly simple man.

Instead, Stone's interest is to account for what motivated George W. Bush to seek the presidency, his intellectual unsuitability notwithstanding.  While the character of Karl Rove plays a somewhat instigating role, Stone hypothesizes that Bush was motivated by the intense need to please his father.  That need has ample reinforcement from George H. W. Bush in the film.  He often compares George Jr. unfavorably to his brother Jeb and just as frequently hints that George Jr. is a screw-up.  I suppose the hypothesis (or some hypothesis) was necessary in order to give the film some depth.  Otherwise the film would have simply been about a dullard in way over his head.

A truly stellar performance is put in by Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney.  The performances of the other actors were so-so, but on the whole they did have an uncanny resemblance to the characters they portrayed  (e.g., Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice).",1235865600,2,1255,5.043689320388349

(Of course, she could have been shamming me for the vote she did not get.) For a different point of view for motivations, read ""Armed Madhouse"" by Greg Palast (Available from Amazon). A film such as this makes one demand that beer be sold at the theater.  The soundtrack, however, although not an ""Easy Rider,"" was pretty good.  The Robin Hood theme pepped things up and the Norman Greenbaum ""Spirit in the Sky"" was a hoot, although ""The Eggplant That Ate Chicago"" could have been a satiric additional reflection of the main character's integrity.",1235865600,,1029,4.953488372093023
3439754,4,B0019LY5IC,"First, the movie:

Oliver Stone delivers not a scathing expose, but instead a relatively nuanced portrait of a character. As he says in the commentary, he is as much a humanist as he is a film director. George W. Bush doesn't wake up in the morning thinking ""I'm a bad guy."" So Stone sees his job as painting as accurate and true a portrait of a character as possible, one which is both true internally as far as motivation as it is true externally in terms of results. I think he achieves this goal in ""W.""

He is aided by some truly wonderful performances. Josh Brolin is great as Bush. Toby Jones is a creepy, terrific Karl Rove, and Richard Dreyfuss is a revelation as Dick Cheney.

Also very helpful is good, crisp writing, and a surprisingly brisk pace. Stone's movies usually top 3 hours - this one clocks in at two. And while there are some condensed and created scenes, Stone takes pains to point out that he has citations and sources for everything, if not the exact moment being portrayed, then for the characterization of people and moments in the ""composite scenes."" The disc contains an annotation section which lists sources, kind of like a scholarly article.

In the end, this movie is entertaining as a character study, and as a study of the effects this kind of character has in our kind of society. We live in a nation which has lost its appreciation for wisdom - and is brimming with rich dullards who have the power to take it over. In such a climate, we are subject to the whims of the character of the people who find themselves in power - and I think Stone has hit the nail on the head by pinpointing the flaws in Bush's character which led to the various catastrophes of the years 2001-2008. You might disagree with this or that based on your politics, and you might reject the thesis of the movie. But I think you'd have a hard time faulting this *as* a movie. Stone knows how to keep a viewer's attention, how to create a scene, and he has all of his powers at his command in ""W."", much as he did with other recent films such as ""World Trade Center.""

Now, as for the Blu-Ray:

This is a solid if unspectacular transfer. It looked pretty much identical to the theatrical presentation. Detail can be strong in spots, especially with faces and cloth textures, but this is not the disc you'll pop in to show off your system. I will say, I appreciate the fine film grain which is present throughout - this movie was thankfully not scrubbed clean by DNR.

Extras include a fine commentary track by Stone. It's a tad dull in spots, but he does a very good job presenting his case for why he made this movie the way he did, and his general thesis in doing so. Deleted scenes are presented in 1080i with optional commentary. Two documentaries, one about the film and one on ""W"" himself, round out the special features. Overall, it's a fine batch of features.

Quite annoying are promos at the beginning of the disc which each must be skipped individually. I'd like to find the people that sell movie companies on this idea, ring each and every one of their doorbells, and present them an unskippable knuckle sandwich right in their stupid monkey faces. I can't imagine a more irritating way of punishing someone who has paid good money to own your film.

If I were just rating the movie, I might be tempted to give it five stars. It isn't as epic as a film like Stone's ""Nixon"" or ""Alexander,"" but then, the subject matter isn't as epic as those men, either. If you are a fan of Stone's, the disc is a no-brainer. It's a very watchable movie with a lot of replay and entertainment value. Political history buffs also likely will get a kick out of it. This might not be the movie to get that religious conservative Blu-Ray buff you know. So, given the film's strengths, the average HD transfer, the decent extras, and the annoying trailers, I say 4 stars all around.",1235779200,,3884,4.451476793248945

Later on, after a moment of conversion, he is shown as a simplistic, religious fanatic who bulls his way to the presidency and who seeks nothing more than a kind word from George Sr.  Each of the characters is instead a caricature and the movie is full of misrepresentations and giant leaps of assumption about the interactions and motivations of the major protagonists.  ""W"" is depicted as a cowboy who jumps on his horse and rides it to the bitter end, insisting that he is always right and never makes a mistake.  Oliver Stone's comment that this movie is not political is ridiculous and is only superseded by his assertion that he got ""into the skin of George Bush"".

3439756,3,B0019LY5IC,"It's not that I don't believe that every single one of the incidents in W. didn't take place, it's just that Oliver Stone discredits himself by making Bush 43 look SO unrelievedly puerile and SO utterly incompetent that Bush almost gains the viewer's sympathy---a difficult feat, considering that Dubya had to be most inept and unfit man ever to sit in the Oval Office, at least since James Buchanan.

Stone's ""Junior"" starts out life as a drunken frat boy who is constantly bailed out of trouble by his supercompetent Daddy, and Junior largely remains that kid all his life, except for the fact that he quits drinking somewhere along the way. Regardless of going dry, W.'s mind never sharpens. He never truly matures and he never adopts a measure of success other than that of his own advancement. By his own lights, Stone's George W. Bush is the most phenomenally successful man in the world. And I'm sure that's true in real life, anyway.

Unfortunately for America, Bush's dream job was to be the Commissioner of Baseball, not the Commander-in-Chief. He runs his White House and manages his foreign policy with all the subtlety of Leo Durocher and Billy Martin's three-headed love child.

Bush's Administration is the hideout of cultured barbarians and frat Nazis whose main focus in life seems to be keeping themselves the main focus of everything. Surrounding himself with smarter sycophants like Karl Rove and Dick Cheney (whom he calls ""Vice"" rather than ""Dick,"" as if it matters), Bush sets his compass by that most egotistical of lodestones---What God wants. It's incredible how well W. knows just what God wants, considering he's never even seen the Guy.

With no intellectual curiosity and little real intellect, Stone's W. is a frightening nitwit who has his hand on The Button. Whether the real one is less of a nincompoop, Oliver Stone has set the biofilm benchmark on this President so low that the film adaptation of Bush's seemingly-eventual War Crimes Trial will show him in a better light.

The characterizations are funny, but don't carry this boring story. Unless you love George W. Bush or been living under a rock the last eight years, why bother?",1235433600,11,571,4.229357798165138

I'm not much for docudrama type movies, and if I'm watching one it usually has something to do with a subject I am interested in. Politics does not fall into this category. But, upon hearing of a George Bush documentary, the first thing that popped into my mind was, ""I wonder if he says misunderestimate?"" I was not disappointed. It went through his asinine years (that is, birth-end of presidency), but it kind of cleared up a few things for me. He might have been an alright president (in the public's eye) if 9/11 and all the war hadn't happened. I mean, c'mon, there is no way to get popular vote during a war. Unless you are able to defeat them single-handedly with no casualties while finding the cure for AIDS.

He does a terrific job of portraying George W. Bush as a psychological basket-case.

And this is fine.  W. was and is a personality of feeble intellect and stunted, 7-year-old emotions.

But that's all Stone does.

He leaves it at that.

Imagine if a movie were made about Hitler or Stalin and only covered their psychological problems.  No doubt they had them.  But the only reason people would care is the enormity of their crimes.

Same here.

SOME time should have been devoted to W's idiotic, murderous, neglectful, help-the-rich and kick-the-poor policies.

I think this film was well done and an excellent transfer to Blue Ray DVD. The DVD also included some very interesting historical background for the film, as well as some speculative source material from which it drew. It depicted the president as a very likeable and sociable man who only wanted to do what he sensed was in the best interest of the country.",1235260800,,505,4.549450549450549
3439762,4,B0019LY5IC,"I enjoyed ""W"" greatly.  However, in the United States, I suspect that views of the movie will be seen through the prism of whether one is a Republican or a Democrat.  In my case, as I am not American and merely an outside observer, I think I can be reasonably independent.  So, at the outset, I will state that I both enjoyed the film and believe that George W Bush was a buffoon who brought disrespect to America that is most unwarranted.  America is the great democracy that is seen as the leading nation of the free world.  It is a great pity that it had to endure the eight years of W.

Obviously, Oliver Stone had an axe to grind.  Any viewer of the film should understand this explicitly.  He portrays Bush as a miscreant.  Bush is the son of privilege; the child born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth.  This is true and should not be a point of debate.  Indeed, it is to Bush's credit that he was able to overcome his wayward past, sober up and then successfully run for public office.

Josh Brolin plays W and is excellent in the role.  He looks like W and, more importantly, sounds like W.  Only Richard Dreyfuss is more convincing as Dick Cheney.  Yet, it is the story that is more relevant than how closely individual actors picked up the various idiosyncrasies of the main protagonists.  And, it is on this point that Stone succeeds.  He outlines the background to W from his time as frat boy at Yale to the emerging failure of the Iraq war to locate weapons of mass destruction.  But to be fair to Bush, Stone completely glosses over the war in Afghanistan which was arguably essential and achieved success.

As mentioned at the outset, many people will reject this film simply because they know of Oliver Stone's point of view.  This is a shame.  ""W"" is a very good film that, although broadly critical of George W Bush, his policies and his verbal malapropisms is, nonetheless, a rollicking good ride.",1235260800,,1929,4.469914040114613
3439763,3,B0019LY5IC,"The movie goes out of its way to try to depict what made George W Bush president and what made President George W Bush a failure, but it has little substance beyond reenacting quotes (usually in the wrong setting) in a loose, disjointed narrative. This isn't a documentary; it isn't a drama; and it isn't really a comedy, tho it desperately wants you to chuckle at times.

The dialog is weak, with characters often telling each other information they both know as a clumsy means of revealing it to the audience (or worse: why would GHWB say to GWB ""...our family, the Bush family""?). The performances are good, but sometimes border on overtly dramatic (Wolfowitz and Powell) and plain caricature (Rice and W). Richard Dreyfus's Dick Cheney stands out as a straight-faced comedic character. Bizarrely, Scott Glenn actually underplays Donald Rumsfeld's eccentricities.

The Blu-Ray release looks great (a bit grainy and desaturated, but by choice), but the menu system is bad. There are several trailers at the beginning, and the menu buttons are disabled (you have to use the chapter forward button several times to get thru all of them). The ""Filmmakers' Research and Annotation Guide"" is a very long series of notes on where various ideas came from, but there is no way out of it. Literally. There is an exit button on screen but I could find no way at all to get to it, and the menu, return, and exit buttons are all disabled.

There is a pretty good commentary by director Oliver Stone, who really needs to stop trying to deconstruct and reconstruct presidents. And there are several other extras of some interest, assuming you liked the film in the first place.

I saw the film because I love the White House and expected numerous scenes in a good replica, but there were rather fewer scenes in the White House than I expected and the sets are not at all very good. The Oval Office and Situation Room are very good, but there is a dining room and an entrance hall that correspond in no way to the real spaces, and other scenes are framed in such a way that you can't even see the room, just the characters.

Tell me, those of you that think that you are so intelligent, what would you have done if you were president when the tragedy of 9/11 happened?  How about having the worst hurricane season right after?  No, the problems in New Orleans weren't W's fault after Katrina.  Look to the governer and mayor (who was elected again although he let New Orleans go to hell during Katrina).  At some point the people in the US have to start taking responsibility for themselves.

To start with, Stone's blind hatred of Bush administration members Rice, Rumsfield and Cheney; and his love affair with Powell is as obvious as a supernova.
Stone tries to portray Cheney as an imperialist and a warmonger, Rice as a brainless court monkey and Rumsfield as a pervert.
The movie contains several instances of complete and utter BS that Stone has trumped up in an attempt to cover the fact that he obviously did next to no real research in the writing of this film and had absolutely no intention of showing the audience anything more than a pack of half truths, misconceptions and flat out lies.
I would say that Stone's film borders on treason if it weren't so completely ridiculous and such a poor representation of reality.
Speaking as an Iraq veteran and former military journalist, and as someone who has actually met and spoken to former Vice President Dick Cheney, Stone is a shameless liar who has proved with this film his irrelevance in the modern world.

In making this film, Stone knew he would have to travel a straight and narrow path, lawyers to the left of him, lawyers to the right. All the characters in the film are drawn from still living persons, any one of whom if ""maligned"" could wield the injunction club and force reshoots or reedits or entomb the master print for a quarter century. Stone and his financiers would be left reeling. Thus we find ourselves at an anticipated Golden Gloves competition, No Punching Profanity Shouting or Spitting Allowed.

In the first portion of this film, I felt like I was caught up in a flash flood. Finally the appearance of Laura calmed me down, here instantaneously was a warm human being. The restaging of the catastrophic White House doings gave me a You Are There simplified refocus on the existent megaton journalistic trove on the same subjects. The physically towering Father Bush was an indulgent exaggeration to make a point. The film evoked no emotion or insight.

You've heard of the Peter Pan syndrome, but maybe not of Kidult or Puer aeternas. These terms, loosely applied, come to me as I see ""George W. Bush"" in the film. As he envisions himself as the Sports Hero as thousands cheer, as he cockcrows at the frat house, as he saucy flirts with Laura girl, as he stuffs sandwiches into his face, as he bullies, as he makes big hard decisions without a second thought, as he relishes landing on the carrier in a pilot costume, as he finally muddles down tongue-tied at the press conference. (Oliver neglected to include a crucial scene of the President on tv tossing Us the People his bad-cholesterol Texas hushpuppies.)

Peter Pan, Kidult, Puer aeternas, playing with Poppy's gun in the Oval Office. By acclamation and chaddy ballots, Little Boy George, the new leader of Our Gang. (Turn green with envy, Farina.)

Only a few of the dozens of Bushborne, misfired, verbal synapses came across the screen, but usually in the wrong context, and almost as an afterthought. Stone instead tries to tell us about Bush from his college days onward where we learn of his ability to memorize the names of his fraternity brothers, in short order, without memorizing much else from his four years at Yale. This left me feeling a little cheated. I knew these things. For the person I watched it with, I was hailed with a number of, did-he-really-say/do-that. It was a revelation for her, and this film was much more to her fulfillment and amusement than mine.

One reviewer found the right phrase that I couldn't muster more than a Bushism for what it was lacking. It's as if this movie wasn't sure if it was a comedy or a drama. Josh Brolin does a superb Bush characterization, as does Dreyfus as Dick Cheney, and the one in the role of Karl Rove as the turdblossom toady. The characters for Rice, Powell, and Rumsfeld are less believable, and Powell's one-man fight against the others underscores his departure after one term.

Oliver Stone brings out some of the worst of George who got a woman pregnant back in the days when he still believed in a woman's right to choose. No time is spent in his Air National Guard days, and there is no mention of Bush's pathological childhood behavior, or his slovenliness when he left his apartment with rent unpaid and substantial repair required. We learn how he met Laura Bush who had a profound impression on him--because he started changing his socks everyday rather than three. We do see his early lack of impulse control when Laura confesses that his speech was bad, and he reacts by smashing the car into the driveway door. On an earlier occasion, we see Georgie, three sheets to the wind, driving his car onto the front lawn, amd making a drunken challenge to his fight his father.

What Stone wants to convey is that Dumbya is a loser in spirit and intellect, that his name, his father's accomplishments and contacts bailed him out of one social or career misadventure after another. George showed little patience and even less aptitude for Wall Street or oil drilling while harboring the unrealistic hope that there was some future for him in baseball. It is little wonder that the family put their hopes in his brother Jeb.

This is comedy light and drama light fare that is not bad to watch, but not one you might want to see a second time, especially if you are hoping for some depth and insight in discovering how such a maladjusted personality and such an underachiever could have ever reached the White House. That means it is probably better as a rental from a service or library, rather than as a purchase.

It is amazing that the man is barely out of office and film about his 8 year presidency and political career is already out.  Josh Brolin gives fantastic performance.  This actor seems to be getting better with age.

Stone cowers everything that there is to cover about Bush Junior: from his fraternity days at Yale to failed business enterprises, his meeting Laura Welsh who became his wife, chocking on the pretzel - just about all major snafys we know about the president from his public appearances.  I particularly liked the subtle display of W.'s inability to speak proper english, use of words that only W. could come up with (such as ""misunderestimated"").

While Oliver Stone is taking it easy on Laura Bush, young idealistic librarian who trades her convictions for a comfortable life with the wealthy Bush heir; he takes Bush's cabinet down with the vengeance. No one is spared from his cabinet.  Not that either one of them deserves it.  They are all sellouts who trade their integrity for the access to power.

Surely, once you have seen this movie, you will be dazed and confused just as W. himself.",1234915200,3,1206,4.84390243902439
3439780,4,B0019LY5IC,"Then again, perhaps it is important to focus on his budding personality flaws before we assess all of the damage he has done to America's image with them. Somehow, Jr. has become something of an enigma-is he evil, or stupid? Stone leans toward stupid, but really, he portrays W as a misguided soul with inner conflicts that played into the hands of major power brokers with their own ideas about the future of the country. In light of all of W's early failures in most of his occupational endeavors, it's a convincing GUT of how Dub worked. Stone takes some of the sting out of all of W's recklessness and blundering and presents you an American portrait instead, which may prove infuriating to a good swath of viewers who are expecting a savaging of the Shrub. Brolin is fabulously all over his role as W, everyone else is solid save for Thandie Newton's mousey take on Condoleeza Rice. She had the look down, but her voice coach should have been flogged.

A special note to idiots: there is no ""agenda"", no ideology, no ""belief system"", no ""liberal take"", or whatever phraseology you've been taught to mouth like automatons in the film. There is no doubt in any rational persons' mind that W's presidency is one of the most controversial to take place in modern history, and it deserves all of the scrutiny it gets. The real effect will be studied much further down the line, but it looks to me like Stone wanted to do a character/personality study rather than put focus on the horrendous mistakes he has made which may take decades to reverse, perhaps more.

It's W the man, not W the monster. You can read a bazillion books about his policies-there is far less journalism on the boy king's inner workings, and we should welcome this angle as a compass to finding out a little more as to why he has done what he has done.",1234828800,5,1824,4.541033434650456

Not that it was a complete bust, but with the talent of Oliver Stone and the richness of material on it's main character, it just seems like it should have been more than what it was. Josh Brolin does a decent George ""W"", but at times reminds one of Timothy Bottoms' or even Will Ferrell's just as good versions played years ago. W. also flashes back and forth from the first signs of the Iraq War showing it's cracks, to W's upbringing from a young college 20 something, then back again, then to being the owner of the Texas Rangers, back to the War, then to his running for Governor, and back again...well, you get the impression that you better take a look at the color of Brolin's hair to figure out just what year it's currently in. Secondary cast members range in acting and appearance from decent to spot-on but not one of them seems too fleshed out within the film's 2 hour and ten minute run time. Strangely, the one secondary character that gets alot of screentime is James Cromwell as Bush Senior, played off as a mean, disapproving father who never really favored W. best. Overall, if your looking for a ""best Of Bush"" storyline, there's a couple of scenes here to please, but alot of it you already knew from the countless news stories of the past eight years to be engaged by it so soon again. And even though when the film was made, even Bush's own presidental ending hadn't been written yet, it could have been better perceived than what ended up here. But even if Stone had a larger budget or more time (or a later one) to work on it, I doubt it could have been any better. It's a decent rental, but highly doubtful for re-election in your player again. Has a commentary and 17 minute ""expert"" look back at the Bush Legacy (which is bias and boring), but not nearly enough to recommend blind-buying, even if you did vote for him again in 2004 (thanks alot...).

Oliver Stone's film covers the Bush administration, but so what?  Tell us something we don't know.  The acting is mostly okay but a little wooden at times.  Brolin's Bush comes across as a buffoon, an ex-drunk who used religion as a cover for his sins.  But everyone already knew that.

3439798,4,B0019LY5IC,"W. is a film not many people want to see or even discuss because of the subject matter - the career of the country's most unpopular President, the debacle of the Iraq War, and the decimated economy. There is a certain 'guilt' that comes with criticizing the leader of the country, from both conservatives and liberals: it is not polite to condemn our elected leaders.  But now with the Bush legacy daily being pushed into the past (though the after burn of that embarrassing 8 years will never completely go away), it is time for biographers to examine why the Bush version of Presidential autonomy occurred.

Oliver Stone has examined Nixon and JFK on film and now with a terse script Stanley Weiser he summarizes the life of George W. Bush, from his early bad boy drinking years and inability to hold a job through his family collisions (brother Jeb being the obvious successor to George Bush, Sr.), to his bull headed drive toward absolute power to finish the war his father didn't finish - securing the Middle East oil fields to be held by American control by fabricating the infamous Axis of Evil and Weapons of Mass Destruction as drivers to light the preemptive blundering war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq.

In lesser hands this film might have become too prejudiced a view of a president.  But Oliver Stone's technique of telling a story makes this film work: we see the rise and fall of a pitifully misguided man whose judgment and lack of intelligence brought us to where we are today.  Much of the success of the film is due to the casting of Josh Brolin as W., James Cromwell as Bush Sr., Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush, Richard Dreyfuss as the terrifying Dick Cheney, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush, Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld, Toby Jones as Karl Rove, Bruce McGill as George Tenet, and a puzzling performance by Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice.  Their characterizations are remarkable and give an insider's view as to the tehniques used to change a democracy into an oligarchy.

Many people may find this film either too biased and cruel (conservatives) or too watered down (liberals), but at least Oliver Stone has once again placed a key figure on the screen for us all to ponder. In time this film will be better accepted, once the smoke clears from the past 8 eight years.  Grady Harp, February 09",1234569600,,2354,4.696601941747573
3439799,3,B0019LY5IC,"Josh Brolin stars as our 43rd President in ""W."" (pronounced ""dubya""), and he does a damned fine job.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is rather muddled.  The plot hews fairly closely to the most widely-known material and accepted facts from Bush's life - his early partying ways, his mediocrity as a businessman, and his meteoric and surprising rise to Governor of Texas and then President.  The most controversial aspects of his life are left out here, which makes the movie adhere more closely to a ""typical"" biopic.

Therein is one of the fundamental problems.  Oliver Stone is known for being a liberal-minded director who isn't afraid of stirring up controversy and even fluffing up conspiracy theories (see ""JFK""). His nerve seems to have failed him here or else getting older has made him more moderate; ""W."" is not the brutal skewering some people are likely to expect.  Bush is portrayed as a lovable buffoon, and it's a rather timid depiction.  Indeed, the tome of ""W."" is uneven, with some of the actors seeming to play their roles as broadly satiric (Thandie Newton's spot on ""impression"" of Condoleezza Rice would fit in nicely on SNL) whereas others take a more realistic approach (Richard Dreyfuss is unrecognizable as a power-hungry Dick Cheney).

Likewise, the movie's tone lies uncomfortably in the middle, neither condemning Bush nor adding much understanding of his character.  The only aspect of his life that it explored that hasn't been examined much previously is the allegedly rather contentious relationship between Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush; who is portrayed here as profoundly disappointed with his son every step of the way, even when he is elected President.  This depiction is at odds with the public persona of George H.W. Bush and his comments about his son, but it could explain certain aspects of W.'s personality.

In the end, ""W."" is likely to frustrate equally people who like Bush and those who despise him.  Perhaps it was simply too soon for this type of movie.  Although ""W."" only covers Bush's first term in office, most people do not yet have the distance to gain perspective on Bush and his Presidency.  Stone's commentary track suggests that he does - he discusses the intense hatred he had toward Bush during the first term as dimming.  However, this perspective has seemingly resulted in a muddled movie unlikely to make anybody very happy.  ""W."" was interesting and even somewhat enjoyable, but it shed little new light on our most recent ex-President.",1234483200,2,2518,4.973747016706444
3439800,3,B0019LY5IC,"Ignore whatever facts may or may not exist (consider them Iraqi WMD's, if you will).  Ignore Stone's political agenda (which, let's face it, most of his viewers usually do).  Judge ""W."" as a movie, as a work of art.  Yes, anything about George W. Bush is bound to be controversial, to bring out liberals who praise it and conservatives who damn it.  Forget politics; look at the film as a MOVIE, which, all politics aside, it is.

That being said, ""W."" doesn't quite stand up.  Oliver Stone has occasionally--though rarely--miss-fired, and ""W."" is unfortunately such a case.  What's worse, the film's failures are due to Stone's personal political agenda; he rushed the film out before the November 2008 elections (what for, we can't help but wonder; Bush was out no matter what), and in doing so sacrificed some artistic integrity.  The movie's first half is little more than a collection of scenes; good scenes, yes, but they don't really congeal into one whole piece.  The last half is certainly the better, as Bush begins to face his inner and outer demons, and America goes into a war nobody's really sure if they want or not

The acting is certainly the film's strength.  Elizabeth Banks brings charisma to the role of Laura Bush; Richard Dreyfuss, as Chaney, is superb; Jeffrey Wright, as Colin Powell, is a scene-stealer; James Cromwell, as Bush Sr., is charismatic and graceful as always.  But, of course, the true star here is Josh Brolin, who tackles the title role.  It is a role that few actors could pull off; however, Brolin's dedication to character is remarkable.  He looks the part and sounds the part, but it is more than that; he finds the strengths and weaknesses of George W. Bush, the privileges and the drawbacks to being the President of the United States.  In other words, as always, Brolin is simply remarkable.

So, whatever politics you have (or don't have), you should judge ""W."" as a film, not a political piece.  Unfortunately, it suffers from the director's ambition to send a political message; perhaps the worst thing is, the film fails in that regard, even--it's not so much too little too late as it is simply needless.  Fortunately, the movie is rooted by strong performances all around, but especially from Josh Brolin, who is shaping up to be one of Hollywood's next great actors.",1234483200,3,2320,4.801007556675063
3439801,3,B0019LY5IC,"I made it a point to shield my eyes and ears from promos and previews for this film, prior to viewing it.  Not that I was expecting to be surprised or enlightened by any new revelation uncovered about Gee-Dub, the man.  I did this because I knew that a film about the 43rd President of The United States could take on one of two approaches.  It would either be a Hollywood sanctioned, two-hour Bush-bashing festival, or it would be an attempt by Oliver Stone and crew to give us a behind-the-scenes look at the forces that shaped the man.  I didn't want to be mentally prepared for either.  That being said, it also served me some good to temporarily disarm myself of any political bias before sitting down to watch this movie.  I would advise you do the same.

  I'll begin my review by saying I was relieved to see that this was NOT just two hours of pot shots.  I've enjoyed eight years of poking fun at Mr. Bush for his obvious lack of wit, but that's not what I sat down to see this time around.  Instead, the makers of ""W"" attempted to provide us with a look inside the life of G.W. Bush.  One of the ways this was done was through the clever use of a few flash-backs (which is to be expected).  Nothing about what we don't already know was revealed in these flash-backs, and that doesn't disappoint me.  I wasn't expecting to learn anything new about Bush from this film.  That's not Oliver Stones' job, and ""W"" is not a documentary.  It's a dramatization based on things most of us already know about Bush.  The film serves up a wealth of scenes laden with speculative dialogue that hint at a few things such as Junior's struggle to please his ""Poppy"", Bush Sr., who wasn't afraid to vocalize his disgust with his son.  There are even a couple of scenes depicting what one could only imagine went on during the ""Skull & Bones"" years at Yale, mixed in with perceived inside looks at W's tried and failed attempts to discover his ""calling"" in life.

  Now, for the diehard Bush-mockers; myself included, this movie doesn't at all disappoint.  Despite its lack of overt jabs, this movie isn't without a justifiable amount of covert comedy added at the expense of our illustrious ex-leader and his cronies.  My favorite happens to be Thandie Newton's portrayal of Condi Rice as a subservient, wrist-wringing, Eegore-esque minion that offered up affirmation to her master's ideas by repeating only the last word of his sentences.  This was topped off with a hunch-backed, 45-degree head nod, while she stared at some spot on the ground.  I loved it!  The writers even found a clever way to include a few of Bush's best-known botched attempts at speech into the script.  But, that's not all that makes the movie watchable.

  Hmmm..., what about the acting?  Aside from Newton's quasi-comedic portrayal as the president's compliant ""mini-me"", I think the acting wasn't all that bad and all major roles were suitably casted.  As with many others, I was surprised to see Brolin playing our leading man, but as the story progressed, his performance grew ever convincing.  I think he pulled it off beautifully.

  To cap it, not everyone will enjoy this movie.  That goes without saying.  What should be said, however, is if you start into this movie armed with a defensive posture, wearing your political beliefs on your shoulder, you won't make it through the first half-hour.  I've been called everything from a bleeding heart liberal to a tree-hugging hippie.  I've sustained my share of verbal chest pokes, while being drenched in regurgitated Rush Limbaugh talking points projectile vomited from the drippy-fanged mouths of Sean Hannity clones, but I was able to put all of that aside and I enjoyed ""W"".  Hell, if I could give O. Stone an ""E"" for effort, I would.  But, for now 3 stars is gonna hafta doo.",1234483200,,3809,4.649175412293853
3439802,2,B0019LY5IC,"There was a time, very long ago, that Oliver Stone made relevant movies, granted he always had an ax to grind, but his movies were not provocative, just to be provocative.  W. is a perfect example, it's obvious Stone is no fan of the former president, but he tries I suppose in his own warped way to understand Bush, and im sure he feels he was fair, but really this is just a badly filmed pseudo intellectual mess.  The performances are all over the place, it's like the actors are as confused as the director.  Brolin is passable as Bush, but he really doesnt ever make you forget that you are watching a caracature..the rest of the cast does sort of bad imatations, with the execteption of the singular Cromwell as Poppy, not really sure 41 was like this, but it's a riviting performance none the less..but really there is nothing to recommend here..it's Stone at his most indulgent..granted this mess is not as bad as Alexander..high praise indeed.",1234483200,,952,4.621301775147929

It glazes over Bush's life, and presidency, and most of it is probably NOT factual.  It will not help you understand why decisions were made.  Oliver Stone does not uncover any ""plots"".  It is simply a silly movie that basically tests the actors to see who can do the best impersonations of the real-life characters they are imitating (The award goes to Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney).  Do not buy this movie.  It is the worst waste of money.  I was sorry I spent money to see it in the theater.  1 Star is an OVER-rating.",1234396800,7,618,4.455357142857143
3439804,5,B0019LY5IC,"I was very impressed with this movie.  The movie is deftly nuanced & paced with the personal & historical details.  It's a challenge to present such a significant topic, but Oliver Stone succeeds in peopling & scripting this movie with believable characters which i think is harder to do when portraying real life contemporary persons.  Plus the selections of events both big & small fit well to make the whole story understandable.  It would have been easy to get lost in either the personal or political events but again the editing & pacing is perfect here in presenting a coherent & entertaining film.

And at the center is a tour de force portrayal by Josh Brolin who here is plays George W. as a believable man, neither shrill nor wooden.

It's a rich & balanced film, with humor & reverence that makes me want to watch it repeatedly to catch all the details.",1234310400,4,865,4.620915032679738
3439805,1,B0019LY5IC,"This is a mixture of some truth mixed with a liberal viewpoint.  Oliver Stone made a statement to the movie world thru his own beliefs as usual.  I found it cruel and unfair to our former president. The only good thing was I think the actors did a good job with accents.  I bought this to give to my Dad (who is a Democrat) thinking he would like it, but I am too embarrased to give it to him now.  People deserve their dignity, and I don't think it was given in this movie.",1234224000,9,474,4.01063829787234
3439826,3,B0019LY5IC,"No one has ever accused Oliver Stone of being subtle. However, once more people see his film concerning the life and times of George W. Bush, I think the perception about the director, which is that he is a rabid conspiracy theorist who rewrites history via Grand Guignol-fueled cinematic polemics, could begin to diminish. I'm even going to go out on a limb here (gulp!) and call W a fairly straightforward biopic.

Stone intersperses highlights (is that the right word?) of Bush's White House years with episodic flashbacks and flash forwards, ostensibly beginning in the late 60s (when Junior was attending Yale) and taking us up to his second (interminable) term.

I'm not saying that Stone doesn't take a point of view; he wouldn't be Oliver Stone if he didn't. He's caught flak in some corners for the amount of screen time spent dwelling on Bush's battle with the bottle (I will say that the manufacturers of Jack Daniels must have laid out some serious bucks for the ubiquitous product placement throughout the film). Bush's history of boozing is a matter of record. It's part of his story (and could explain a lot of things). Some have taken umbrage at one of the underlying themes of Stanley Weisner's screenplay, which is that Bush's angst (and the drive to succeed at all costs) is propelled by an unrequited desire to please a perennially disapproving George Senior. I'm no psychologist, but that sounds reasonable to me.

As usual, Stone has assembled a massive cast with a bazillion speaking parts (I daresay he matches the late Robert Altman in this department).  His choice of Josh Brolin for the lead initially struck many people as an odd selection (including yours truly), but now that I have seen the film, I have to say it was a smart move. Brolin is nothing short of brilliant. He doesn't go for a cartoon caricature, which would have been the easy route to take; I think he pulls off a Daniel Day Lewis-worthy ""total immersion"" quite successfully. It is interesting to note that Brolin (tangential to Junior) has been accused of riding into a Hollywood career on the coattails of his dad (James Brolin) and stepmother (Barbara Streisand); if Stone chose his leading man with this in mind, he is a very canny operator.

Some of the other standouts in the cast include Toby Jones (""Infamous"") as Karl Rove, James Cromwell and the great Ellen Burstyn as President and Mrs. Bush Sr., Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell and Richard Dreyfuss (perfect!) as Dick Cheney. Scott Glenn isn't given an awful lot to do as Donald Rumsfeld, but he has the evil squint down. The only misfire is an overly mannered Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice; it is like she dropped in unexpectedly from a Saturday Night Live sketch. Perhaps it is not entirely her fault, because they put so much prosthetic on her face, she can barely move her lips.

If the Bush administration had never really happened, and this was a completely fictional creation, I would be describing Stone's film by throwing out superlatives like ""A wildly imaginative look at the dark side of the American Dream!"" or ""A vivid, savage satire for our times!"" But you see, when it comes to the life and legacy of one George W. Bush and the Strangelovian nightmare that he and his cohorts have plunged this once great nation into for the last eight years, all you have to do is tell the truth...and pass the popcorn.",1234051200,14,3381,4.751277683134583
3439827,1,B0019LY5IC,I don't like Oliver Stone and his movies (except World Trade Center) and I think he's a stupid film maker. This movie is another failure like Alexandre and JFK..... I think one star is even too much for it. ((BDS stands for Bush Derangement Syndrome - I believe Oliver Stone suffers from BDS too)),1234051200,2,297,4.518518518518518
3439828,1,B0019LY5IC,"As someone said in an earlier review, ""If you hate Bush, you'll probably like this...""  Well, I hate Bush and I hated the movie!  Unlike with Nixon, Stone was too easy on him.  I suspect, however, that the film reflects most of the truth.  As much as I diagree with all that Bush was about, I think that he was genuine in his love for this Country and meant the best for it.  I was just a bit shocked that Stone let him off the hook so easily.",1234051200,4,443,3.9886363636363638
3439829,2,B0019LY5IC,"One thing that immediately struck me when W came out was the odd timing.  Why on earth would a filmmaker choose to put out a movie on the Bush presidency so close to its end when the end result will be a movie that lacks closure and feels unfinished?  Had the movie been spectacular, this could have been forgiven, but in many ways W. is a truly forgettable movie.  I thinks it's easy enough to leave politics out of whether or not you like this movie.  I suppose if you don't like Bush, chances are you'll like W., but that's not really the point.  I know people who despise Richard Nixon, but loved Frost/Nixon.

The movie follows two separate timelines and jumps back and forth between the two.  The first begins with college era Bush, the other begins right after 9/11.  There's no real point to splitting the movie up in such a way, expect that had the story been told from start to finish, the movie might had been even worse.  There are other continuity issues that cause serious problems as well.  The most glaring issue is that many of the infamous ""Bushisms"" make appearances in the movie, but never in the context of when Bush actually said them.  Someone made the decision to cram in as many of them as possible, whether or not it made sense to do so.

The movie's most serious issue though is that it can't decide whether or not it wants to be a parody/caricature, or a serious movie....a comedy, or a drama.  Bush's character jumps back and forth between the two throughout the movie.  Dick Cheney and Condi Rice seem like they're straight out of an SNL skit, while Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld are played in a serious way.  This is incredibly distracting and I think it speaks to the fundamental problem with this movie and that's the fact that the 'story' Oliver Stone wanted to tell doesn't make for a good movie.  It's just not that interesting.  Maybe Stone thought that because aspects of Bush are comedic for lack of a better term, they would make for a good movie, but that's just not the case.  If you've paid more than just passing attention to the news during Bush's presidency, you won't learn anything new.  If you haven't been paying attention...first of all what's wrong with you?  Second, this would be a horrible place to start if you want to learn about the last 8 years.",1233792000,38,2307,4.5
3439830,3,B0019LY5IC,"If you are looking for factual details behind historical events...or even an educated guess on what goes on behind the political curtains...you will be greatly disappointed in this film; however, if you are looking to be entertained by a toned-down version of the media's portrait of this President's personality (yes, it's superficial)...you may find it amusing.  Bottom line...buy this for the mild entertainment factor, don't expect a history lesson.",1233792000,2,453,5.565217391304348
3439831,2,B0019LY5IC,"On a side note, I hope Oliver Stone was joking in an appearance he made on The Colbert Report when he praised George W. Bush's presidency and said he was the greatest president in history. He scares me sometimes, Stone does.

On another note, the movie does not feel much at all like an Oliver Stone-type movie, though it has enough of his style in it: frequent and non-chronological flashbacks (Alexander, JFK, Natural Born Killers, etcetera), and a perpetual Father/Child conflict (Natural Born Killers, Platoon, Alexander).

For the cast, they did the best they could, and most of the actors very much look and sound the role, from Richard Dreyfuss whose resemblance to Cheney is marred only by Dreyfuss's liver spots and slightly darker skin, to Thandie Newton's Condoleeza Rice, and Bruce McGill's George Tenet.

The others fall a bit short, such as Scott Glenn, who's much too skinny, shrimpy, and sleazy Richard-Belzer-looking to pull off a convincing Donald Rumsfeld; he looks more like an older version of that guy who hosted Beat the Geeks on Comedy Central. Josh Brolin gets Bush's voice and movements down perfectly without looking or sounding like a comedic parody, while James Cromwell manages to encapsulate gravitas, but is pretty much a completely different person than George HW Bush. And Toby Jones's face is too misshapen to fit much like Karl Rove.

The movie in itself takes a very straight-forward, unbiased approach, which while offering some mildly interesting insights (such as Bush's first experience with attack ads in his first run for Governor of Texas, to his incorporation of them in his father's Presidential campaign), these only remain MILDLY interesting; the movie just shows us things we would have heard about in the news or read about in biographies or writings. The more personal moments have a sort of disappointing factor about them in that they are complete and utter conjecture, and they STILL fail to provide more than just superficial filler or exposition.

Humor is so light and toned-down as to be nonexistent; very little is funny here beyond slight chuckles or snortles.

For the character of George Bush itself, the movie only serves to humanize him in a way that could have been done with a simple documentary maybe half as long: For example, his early party and drinking days are dished out in such a way as to show him not as a nasty, crude, misogynistic, college frat-boy like you might see in bad teen comedies like ""Sorority Boys"" (or the frat guys in ""Borat""), but as a regular guy who makes friends in a fraternity, drinks a lot, and has simple dreams of doing this or that, oblivious to the fact that only his father's wealth and influence gets him there.

His presidency is treated in such a way that Bush is both distant from the darker and more shady aspects, while always on top of everything as ""The Decider""---there is the lunch scene where he agrees to an ""enhanced interrogation"" measure simply by seeing that the measure is three pages long, and thus he'll trust Cheney to carry it out humanely, and then proceeds to exert clear power over Cheney by sternly telling him he wants this treated responsibly.

In another scene in the war room, Cheney and Rumsfeld go off on tangents regarding Iraq and Iran, and a seeming future fantasy of an American Empire dominating the Middle East. Bush quashes this and brings everyone's focus back on Iraq.

The movie portrays Bush as almost as much of a victim with regards to the Iraq War as the American people were---George Tenet is the one frustrated by the severely questionable evidence for Saddam's WMDs, and yet Cheney pushes for its inclusion in official reports to a degree that Tenet simply gives up and allows it to be passed as solid intelligence. By 2004, Bush is seen angrily demanding from his top officials why no WMDs have been found and questioning if there even were any to begin with.

Little else really happens, and the direction is very clear on focusing on Bush's turbulent relationship with his father as his motivation for almost every major decision in his career, always to seek his father's approval without an undermining addendum (If only I could have attended two inaugurations this year, Bush Sr. says to that effect before George W.'s inauguration as Governor of Texas, after Jeb Bush lost his run in Florida).

In total, the film is only controversial in that some people will claim it's boring and other people will claim it's bullcrap. It does a highly successful job of making Bush a human figure and a likable person, while at the same time doing a complete spin-job by making him seem utterly unaccountable for any of the bad things that had happened throughout his administration, and giving absolutely no background information on the supposedly close relationship with George Bush and Karl Rove. Considering how he is portrayed as the Ego to his Administration's Id (Cheney and Rumsfeld, and to a smaller degree, Rice) and its Superego (A highly tragic Colin Powell, portrayed by Jeffrey Wright fantastically, George Tenet, and others), this can only amount to either top-notch spin, or such a powerful desire to overcome a controversial reputation as to go in the complete opposite direction of a ""hatchet-job"" as to accidentally do just as bad a thing in making a hero of a man who is neither hero nor villain. He's just Bush.",1233532800,3,5378,4.866666666666666

Bush, it's really a fantastic movie that begins at 2003 when W. was considering going into IRAQ and it progresses at a well balanced pace as it mainly consists of these flashbacks into W.'s life.

The entire cast is superb and if you liked Josh Brolin in No Country For Old Men then you're going to love him in this, for a few minutes I actually thought I was looking at W.

Oliver Stone is getting his career back on track.",1232755200,9,507,4.644444444444445
3439835,4,B0019LY5IC,"A lot of people will hate ""W."" People who love/respect the former president will find it distasteful, biased and untrue. Those who hate the man will probably find it as an over glorified and too restrained portrait of a man who many call the ""worst president of all time"". So, who is this movie for? In my opinion, anyone who just likes good biographies.

""W."", Oliver Stone's controversial biopic of George W. Bush from his college days to the end of his first term as president is a fascinating film that you just need to see. ""W."" marks what is possibly the first film by the director that actually just shows the story. There is really no way to tell which way the writer/director voted in 2000 and 2004 based on this film because it's that neutral. There are scenes where speech flubs are made (the famous ""misunderestimate"" is casually throw out near the end), fights (both verbal and nearly physical) between father and son Bush and moments of complete embarrassment (in a press conference Bush tries to remember a reporter's name but comes out with ""Miss China"" because the woman is Asian). These could be taken as signs that this is a Bush-bashing film, but how can something be demeaning if Bush actually said and did these things?

According to Stone, everything in this film can be proven with documented evidence (with the exception of several 'dream sequences' where Bush is on a baseball field). In fact, there's apparently a documentary or book in the making chronicling all the sources used to make the film.

I'm sure Bush supporters will find this evidence falsified and inaccurate, but regardless nothing happens in the film, I feel, that doesn't seem far fetched or made up. Most of what's shown was publicly seen by millions so I don't see how that can be untrue.

But by this using this straight forward approach to Bush's life and presidency is where Bush haters will jump off the wagon as well. Early advertisements for this film make it appear as a comedy; a real roast of the 43rd president, but to the dismay of those expecting that, it's not.

I know people will disagree, but I feel this film to be one of the most unbiased biographies ever made; and to think it came from Oliver Stone only adds to my praise for the director and his work.

The performances are all universally excellent. While not my first choice to play the commander-in-chief, Josh Brolin is amazing. There are moments when you actually believe it's Bush onscreen (the voice is extremely realistic). Elizabeth Banks (as Laura), James Cromwell (as H.W.), Ellen Burstyn (as Barbara) and Toby Jones (as Karl Rove) are never truly convincing in their respective parts, but still put on a pretty good illusion. The actor to see in this movie, however, is Richard Dreyfuss; who morphs himself into Dick Cheney. The disgruntled facial expressions, slightly hunched shoulders and those menacing dark eyes can send chills down your spine. But we get no more than that. In fact, the only viewpoint we get is Bush's and no one else's; this is really ""THE George Bush Movie""; ""BUSHOVISION"" as I remarked after watching the film. This helps and hurts the film, because you want to see what's going on in the lives of those around Bush as well, but you don't. Maybe there will be a Cheney film next; I'm thinking ""Undisclosed Location"" as a title.

Regardless of the controversy that has surrounded this film, if you like biopics, then this movie is for you. But if you're looking for a Bush-praising or Bush-bashing story then move along, because this is neither.",1232582400,12,3550,4.73462783171521
3439836,5,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone's latest film, W. is one that will, not surprisingly, attract a lot of controversy. How you feel about it will likely depend on your political views. Me, well, I'm a total flaming liberal, and I found the movie... enjoyable. Great, but not perfect.

The movie might as well be called ""George W Lives in His Daddy's Shadow"", since most of the movie centers around the feelings of inadequacy that young W feels. We see him going through hazing at his fraternity, running for office in Texas (and having the Democratic candidate to him what he would go on to do to others so very well), and eventually see him getting to the White House.

One at the White House much of the story centers around the lead up to the Iraq War. We get glimpses back to the early 1990's showing why the first President Bush didn't go all the way to Baghdad, we see George Tennant (played by the wonderful Bruce McGill, who could also play a dandy Bill Richardson), trying to explain, repeatedly, that there's no evidence of nukes in Iraq, and we see Cheney's master plan for the USA to control as much of the world's oil as we can.

Josh Brolin is really excellent as W. He doesn't have the look, but rather like Anthony Hopkins in one of Oliver Stone's other, better films, Nixon, he does capture the body language and the voice of Bush 43. Other notable performances are Jeffery Wright as Colin Powell, Richard Dreyfus as Dick Cheney and, in one of his better performances, James Cromwell as Bush 41.

The movie lags at parts and frankly I would've liked to have seen more about Bush as President than Bush as booze-hound or Bush as born again Christian. Still and all, it was a decent enough film and worth seeing, if for no other reason than my favorite line from the film where Bush Sr tells W something along the lines of, ""You can't spend your life drinking, partying and chasing women! You're not a Kennedy, for God's sake!""

The movie might as well be called ""George W Lives in His Daddy's Shadow"", since most of the movie centers around the feelings of inadequacy that young W feels. We see him going through hazing at his fraternity, running for office in Texas (and having the Democratic candidate to him what he would go on to do to others so very well), and eventually see him getting to the White House.

One at the White House much of the story centers around the lead up to the Iraq War. We get glimpses back to the early 1990's showing why the first President Bush didn't go all the way to Baghdad, we see George Tennant (played by the wonderful Bruce McGill, who could also play a dandy Bill Richardson), trying to explain, repeatedly, that there's no evidence of nukes in Iraq, and we see Cheney's master plan for the USA to control as much of the world's oil as we can.

Josh Brolin is really excellent as W. He doesn't have the look, but rather like Anthony Hopkins in one of Oliver Stone's other, better films, Nixon, he does capture the body language and the voice of Bush 43. Other notable performances are Jeffery Wright as Colin Powell, Richard Dreyfus as Dick Cheney and, in one of his better performances, James Cromwell as Bush 41.

The movie lags at parts and frankly I would've liked to have seen more about Bush as President than Bush as booze-hound or Bush as born again Christian. Still and all, it was a decent enough film and worth seeing, if for no other reason than my favorite line from the film where Bush Sr tells W something along the lines of, ""You can't spend your life drinking, partying and chasing women! You're not a Kennedy, for God's sake!""

And he's right. George W Bush is many, many things, but he's certainly no Kennedy.",1231459200,10,2004,4.509641873278237

However, W. focused more on the character of President Bush and Milk focused more on the political career of Harvey Milk.  I just found Milk to be too linear in its narrative scope and as a result, not very absorbing.  I liked how W. jumped around in time, revealing a key moment of President Bush's character development.  It was like watching a Greek tragedy or a Shakespearean play.  Furthermore, I thought Josh Brolin's interpretation of President Bush was much better than Sean Penn's rendition of Harvey Milk.

3439840,5,B0019LY5IC,"With the film W., rather than cover the scope of George W. Bush's disservice to humanity - doing so would require more sequels than ROCKY and FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH combined - director Oliver Stone goes only far enough to show what motivates the man the United States Supreme Court installed as president in 2000.  Stone's focused, restrained narrative results in a telling biography.

Several times in W. scenes where he's president, George W. Bush utters one of his most noteworthy childish bromides, ""I'm the decider.""  As W. cuts back and forth between the presidency and Bush's earlier years, it becomes clear why he keeps saying that, why his actions don't reflect reality: George W. Bush wants to prove he doesn't need his father George Bush; George W. Bush wants to prove he is not the second-rate older brother of the family favorite, Jeb Bush, who would have been the one Republicans groomed for the 2000 presidential run had he not lost the 1994 election for Florida governor while George W. Bush won in Texas.  For George W. Bush, decisions and their consequences are besides the point, which is everyone should know he's the decider, independent of his father and in greater power than his father's choice for First Son, his brother.

Bush repeatedly saying he's the decider reminds me of the scene in THE GODFATHER, PART TWO where Fredo Corleone bemoans younger brother Michael passing him to become head of the family.  Had Fredo become boss instead of Michael in THE GODFATHER, George W. Bush becoming president would have been life imitating art.

3439841,3,B0019LY5IC,"It was with a lot of review 'pollution' already in the bag I stepped in to see this awaited depiction of one of the least respected public figures of all time. The reviews were very mixed from those stating it was a highly realistic picture that was painted to those who claim it was (too) full of assumptions and outright historically incorrect passages.

I personally (as usual) tend to believe it to be somewhere in between... and frankly do not see it as essential if it word by word would mirror reality.. if so no documentaries or biographies would ever be written or made into movies.

The actors did a very good job putting their characters on the silver screen and particularly Dreyfuss did an amazing job with Cheeney..

I agree with others that even the most staunch Bush critic would tend to feel a bit sorry for the mans insecurities and the manipulation taking place among his hand picked advisers but it still lends more concerning questions.

Are staunch religious beliefs (of any kind) combinable with good governance? Can we in otherwise secular societies allow our elected leaders to claim they were chosen by their god to rule our nations ? and conversely can we avoid it? These are very interesting and disturbing questions that the depiction of prayer before meetings etc. leaves us with. What if there had been multiple religions represented in the room? or agnostics/atheists? Should future advisers be picked based on their religious beliefs rather than their abilities?

Bush is not the first troubled president of the USA or any other nation  but how troubled can a candidate be, how can the public assure that these traumas are not impacting important decision making going forward?

The movie was in my mind good but not great... good acting performances and a very relevant topic and whether or not it was entirely authentic does hardly matter.",1228780800,,1874,4.855799373040752

He deserves far worse treatment than he's given in W. However, that treatment has been dished out in so many documentaries over the years that it has become trite. For Stone to make that type of film at this point would be just as trite. It's easy to to condemn his empathetic exploration as some sort of pardoning or endorsement of what Bush has done. That is not at all the point the point of this  film. Stone has repeatedly criticized Bush on his actions. He calls on those actions in the film as well. It might not be as heavy handed as most of us want but it is indeed there. I judge a film by how much I get absorbed by it and W had me quite engaged. The acting, directing, writing, and cinematography are all solid. There are flaws. It could have dug deeper into significant events. Still, I highly recommend it.",1226793600,2,962,4.256830601092896
3439844,3,B0019LY5IC,"I am giving this film 3 stars for two actors, Josh Brolin and Richard Dreyfuss. As George W Bush and Dick ""Vice"" Cheney, they convincingly portray their still contemporary counterparts without seeming utterly unlike their subjects and without falling into parody. Unfortunately for the rest of the movie, that can't be said for the bulk of the characters.

Frankly, Thandi Newton's Condoleezza Rice is one of the most annoying things to land on a contemporary film since JarJar Binks. Speaking in a pinched nasally whine, she completely misses Rice's intelligence, even as she captures the Secretary of State's well known sycophanphropy. And as everyone knows, Karl Rove is a big obese blob of a man, but Toby Jones looks like a wimpy elf. As George Herbert Walker ""Poppy"" Bush, Oliver Cromwell bring an air of Aristocracy to the Elder Bush, but little of his mannerisms.

The movie itself lacks drive. ""W"" is little more than a standard biopic about a boring spoiled kid with sibling rivalry problems and Daddy issues. While it grazes the deep cynicism that permeates our political system (W ran for office so he could show up Jeb?!?), it fails to generate any heat. Given the volatility of the topic - and I am 100% comfortable in predicting that history will record 43 as The Worst President Ever - Director Oliver Stone decided not to exploit many of the easy targets and tries for subtlety.

Which makes ""W"" a big bore. The far-left will cry that it doesn't go far enough; the Bushie-Loyals will scream that their heroes aren't bold or celebrated enough. The one scene that shows any real conflict (Colin Powell snapping about a ""Five time deferral"" VP making War policy and a confrontation that ends with Cheney on the receiving end of an f-u bomb. Yet even that is left hanging, as Bush seems to be more engaged than is often reported. The film makes George W Bush human. Most humans are dull people. That may be W.'s biggest sin of omission. It's a boring movie about a dullard of a man that has all the impact of a Biography Channel documentary.

3439845,4,B0019LY5IC,"""W."" is a look at the 43rd President of the United States (Brolin), and is told in a non-linear fashion.  The main story takes place from about 2002 onward, while flashing back to key points in Bush's past, including his time at Yale, meeting Laura (Banks), working for his father (Cromwell), and his decision to run for governor of Texas.  In the ""present"", Bush is dealing with the Iraq war and its ramifications.

""W."" is an odd film that sometimes tries to be a serious drama, and other times branches off into satire territory.  It is interesting, looking at Bush's ""daddy issues"" and their motivation for the man he becomes.  But then, performances like Newton's Condoleezza Rice are downright campy and take away from the overall effect of the film.  Also, dream sequences undermine the factual elements of the film, since it is unlikely that President Bush had any input into this film.  Brolin's performance is solid enough to make this worth seeing.  Bush does not really come off that bad, the same cannot be said for Cheney.  Liberals will think it doesn't go far enough, conservatives will think it went to far, and those in the middle will probably find it the most interesting.

But I got so much more.  Oliver Stone ignored the 2000 election and 9/11, to focus on Bush as a real person.  I have met President Bush on several occasions and I can say, despite being part of the Republican machine he is a most likeable guy.  Stone must have known this as well.

You may enter the theater a Bush critic, but you will leave an empathizing Bush critic.  Elizabeth Banks was soft and believable as Laura Bush.  She seemed like the type of person someone like Bush would be pulled to and depend on.  I was afraid she would be portrayed as a caricature of herself: librarian, do goody.  Her character in the movie was a pleasant surprise for me.

W.- was a strong machine of its own, bringing to life a troubled, tortured, and driven individual.

3439867,4,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone has often warned of vast conspiracies involving world political and religious leaders that would eventually coincide with the elimination of the United States and the arrival of the New World Order. He has instructed his followers to sell all their possessions, donate the proceeds to him so that he can make more movies, and flee to rural areas.

In the 1980s, Stone claimed the United States would face an economic collapse; that President Reagan would be removed from office; and that a limited nuclear war would strike the U.S. and wipe out every major city, citing them all name by name. His insistence was that if these prophecies did not come true by May 1988, he would declare himself a false prophet and end his film career. Even as those prophecies of ""the upcoming destruction of America"" famously failed, he has always maintained them to this very day, as proof that those events will eventually occur.

On March 6, 2001, Oliver Stone was purportedly ""visited"" by ""a circular, Seven-Angel cloud"" while eating lunch at a diner in Malibu. This apparition was allegedly witnessed by three other people, and Stone has used this ""cloud"" as a correlation with William Branham. Branham is regarded by some as the ""Sixth Angel Messenger,"" while Stone is seen as the ""Seventh Angel Messenger,"" all derived from interpretations of the Book of Revelation. His vision claimed to see visions of the September 11 attacks months ahead of time; they also intertwined with his classic failed prophecies from years earlier. None of these claims have ever truly been verified.

Some of his movies have addressed his claims of the 1980s claims, including ""JFK"" and ""The Doors""; citing New Orleans as proof that ""a city was destroyed by God"" (though it was actually due to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and not by a nuclear attack). In addition, he has insisted to the media that he is not a false prophet, that ""these were never prophecies, but statements"" and that ""anyone who says otherwise is telling a lie"" and are ""liars.""

A lot of people are going to bash this film or praise this film depending on their opinion of the sittign president... but to really understand the angle Stone is taking, you must first understand Stone.",1225497600,,2243,4.879265091863517
3439868,4,B0019LY5IC,"Are Americans ready for a movie that portrays President George W. Bush's life as an Oedipal drama?  In ""W,"" Josh Brolin plays the current president as a kind of Austin Powers party boy with major unresolved father issues.  (In the movie, he does not actually utter the line, ""Daddy doesn't love me!"" but comes close.)  Here, he's invariably second to brother Jeb, which may not be surprising, since the latter (at least here) is able to embark on a career and doesn't constantly require his father's intervention to fix his booboos.  In contrast, W.'s pre-political life is checkered with failure, until he becomes a born again Christian (swapping Poppy for a more forgiving father) and runs for governor of Texas, and eventually President of the United States.

The real hero of the film, if there is one, was James Cromwell's portrayal of Bush Senior, who never completely grasps the effect his behavior has on his son, and who is forced to watch W. commit blunders on a global scale.  Also giving good performances are Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney, and Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice, all of whom must also watch their Commander in Chief bumble his way through the 9-11 crisis with bravado but not a whole lot of sense.

While this way of framing W's life makes for a more sympathetic film than you might expect, it
raises questions.  If we're going to place so much emphasis on Bush's upbringing as an explanation/excuse for his political agenda, what about Saddam Hussein and his unresolved father issues?  Or Osama bin Laden, who has a lot of siblings and probably didn't get much of his dad's time?  Would we, as a country, not be in this never-ending war, if the perpetrators' fathers had given them more positive attention?

3439869,3,B0019LY5IC,"Stone was either being over cautious (having developed PTSD associated with pressure and marginalization following ""JFK"") or he's lost his ability to make good movies.

Although I thought the cast and Stone's direction of their acting were O.K. to very good, the story line was disjointed -- not helped by continuous flash backs and flash forwards to disconnected time points. When trying to extract the basic story, I concluded it's about an inept son endlessly trying to get his father's approval -- and never succeeds no matter what he improbably accomplishes. If the main characters had not been Bush and his henchmen then it would have been a poor rendering of some father-son cliche.

The language in the dialogue was too tame to be the real thing -- not enough, barely any, expletives. Condi Rice et al were carboard cutouts. But the worst was that none -- make that NONE -- of the characters underwent any character/personality changes. There was no development of any kind. Finally, the Bush character was portrayed as a classically tragic hero (rather than the country that he had so utterly abused). So then from begininng to end Stone's movie lacked honesty.

Giving ample space for artistic license, which I actually encourage, this still was too much caricature and too little authentic truth to leave a credible impression of what ""w"" really was like.

W's story, told with sensitivity and depth, and without rancor, is actually quite sufficient to carry a meaty if not a robust plot. However, this ""cartoon of W"" should have been beneath a filmmaker of Stone's caliber. This movie even casts a negative shadow over some of Stone's earlier work, which I actually thought was quite well done. However, in light of this ""rush to judge"" W badly, Stone screwed up.

I left the movie thinking more about Stone than about ""W"" and that is a statement in itself.

Two stars",1224892800,3,857,4.7
3439872,2,B0019LY5IC,"It is necessary for me to start by saying that I have never been a fan of Oliver Stone's films. Part of filmmaking, in my opinion, a necessary part of every film, is to, in some way; entertain the people watching the film. Many films also educate, inform, incite, but entertainment needs to be a part of the equation of any successful film. Too often, Stone is so intent on getting his message across, he begins to beat the viewer over the head with these ideas. Subtlety is lost. When the film becomes a lecture, it is no longer entertaining. So I often avoid Stone's films or catch them on DVD.

But I should also say I am a very liberal Democrat, which is why I went to see ""W"". The liberal Democrat in me was stronger than my distaste for Stone's films.

But ""W"" is not a good film. Apparently, Stone was so intent on getting the film into theaters before the election, he fast-tracked the project, rushing every aspect of production.  And it quite frankly shows on the screen. When I exited the theater after the screening, my companion and I both agreed the film was on a par with a television movie. Something you might see on Lifetime Television.

Why was Stone so intent on getting the film into theaters before the election? What effect did he hope it would have? Bush isn't up for reelection. I don't get it.

But to have any kind of power, the film has to show us something new. Something we didn't already know. Something the average viewer couldn't have already gleamed from a mixture of skits on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" or ""Saturday Night Live"" or through various exposes in magazines like ""Vanity Fair"".

And ""W"" doesn't tell us anything new. The ""big"" revelation the film seems intent on beating us over the head with is little more interesting than your average TV movie. ""W"" simply dies on screen. Which is a shame. Because as much as I dislike Stone's films, I dislike the work of our current president even more and would have loved to see a truly great, insightful look at everything that went wrong with his presidency.

A far better expose of the 43rd President continues to lie in Michael Moore's film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". Check that out instead. Moore delves into the various political and business connections of the Bush family and their political co-horts, connecting the dots for us to see.

That said, there is one reason to watch ""W"", maybe when it appears on DVD or cable (Lifetime?). And that one reason is Josh Brolin's portrayal of Bush 43. From the moment Brolin appears on screen, he seems to be channeling something deep, very deep, to make this character interesting and multi-faceted. Perhaps more interesting and multi-faceted than he has a right to be based on the writing and directing.

We initially meet W as he leads a meeting of his senior staff at the White House, trying to come up with the ""Axis of Evil"" speech. Then, through a series of flashbacks, we see a few moments in W's early life; presumably to give us an idea of what led to this man becoming President. He gets hazed at Yale, he gets bailed out of jail by 'Poppy' (James Cromwell) and he quickly gives up on a job on an oil rig. Poppy, who is running for the Senate, doesn't know what to do with the boy, especially since Jeb is going to graduate with honors. And you get a clue about Stone's theory about how W became the President. It's a weak theory, especially as portrayed in the film, which is part of the significant problem with ""W"". The flashbacks seem particularly rushed, even unfocused. Is Stone's theory about this man really that superficial?

Then one fateful night, Poppy asks W to run his campaign for President. Bush 43 comes up with the Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis. And the rest is history.

Brolin does a good job of portraying Bush and often walks a fine line, tottering between caricature and an actual attempt at creating a meaningful performance. There are moments when Bush seems in charge and other moments when he seems like a fool, ripe for leading by Karl Rove (Toby Jones) and Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss). It is an interesting, intelligent performance for a man I don't think necessarily deserves such treatment.

The rest of the cast is much more problematic. Thandie Newton (""Mission: Impossible 2"", ""Beloved""), who plays Condoleezza Rice is probably the most successful at recreating the actual person, copying her speech pattern and mannerisms. But the performance lacks any bite or insight into who Rice is. The portrayal makes her seem far too inconsequential and powerless. Richard Dreyfuss manages to grit his teeth once or twice, ala Jon Stewart's impression of Cheney as The Penguin, but that's about it. The performance also lacks any bite or insight. Jeffrey Wright plays Colin Powell. Stone seems especially kind to Powell, giving his character the benefit of hindsight. In virtually every one of his scenes, Wright plays Powell as repentant or against the rest of the group. A brief, very brief scene shows Powell going along with Bush 41 and Cheney during the first Gulf War. As we all know, hindsight is 20/20 and Powell shouldn't be let off so easily simply because he now regrets his decisions. Donald Rumsfeld, on the other hand, is clearly despised by Stone. Scott Glenn's portrayal only serves to make the former Secretary of Defense seem like a complete idiot. At one point, while everyone else is contemplating the consequences of their actions, Stone focuses on Rumsfeld stuffing his face with a huge fork of pie, the Secretary seemingly oblivious to anything but the sweet dessert.

Elizabeth Banks plays Laura Bush and seems suitably supportive throughout. Moments of disagreement and/ or criticism seem to have been few and far between in this Bush household. She merely frowns when W proves he has a drinking problem (one or two many times I might add). She merely frowns when W accepts a job from his father to lead his campaign for President, ensuring they will have to relocate to Washington. She frowns a lot, but doesn't look or act like the real Laura Bush.

Ellen Burstyn is even more problematic. She has the emblematic white hair of Barbara Bush, but has very few scenes and only pops up occasionally to show how strong willed she is. I think there was an attempt to paint her as rather crude; she is seen swearing in a few scenes, but this doesn't really come across that well.

James Cromwell is the most successful member of the supporting cast. As Poppy Bush, he manages to convey Bush 41's unique and distinctive speech patterns on a few occasions. And he conveys 41's broken heart when he loses his re-election bid. It is an interesting performance and perhaps the most completely realized characterization after the work of Brolin.

But there is an attempt to portray their bond as a mythic father-son relationship and this aspect of the story is not successful. There are more than a few references to W trying to do things to please his father, seeking his dad's approval. But he never receives it. Which is apparently what drove W to become President. Yawn. What drove him to invade Iraq? To finish the job his dad started and in the process making Poppy proud. Yawn.

This argument may be true, but it is so clichd and 'been there, done that' over and over again that we can't really care if this is the reason W is what he is. To make this really powerful, we would probably have to see Bush 41 do something completely egregious or sickening, something to make him seem mean, powerful or Machiavellian. None of this happens. He simply disapproves. And he has a lot to disapprove of. But it doesn't make this aspect of their relationship a powerful thing to watch.

""W"" is also a poorly conceived film. Opening with a meeting in the Oval Office to work out the details of the Axis of Evil speech, the narrative shuttles back to W's college days and moves back and forth quickly. Generally, when a film begins to incorporate flashbacks, they are provided to help illustrate something happening in the current day. The flashbacks in ""W"" attempt to show us some of Bush's early activities (he basically got drunk a lot, which led to him becoming a Born Again Christian). But what created the idea of an ""Axis of Evil""? In one scene, we see W say he is going to go after Sadam because he tried to 'kill my daddy'. And we see Bush 41 say why he calls Sadam Sah-dam. But these moments just don't connect. Or provide enough of an impetus for Bush 43's actions or motivations

Because of the subject matter, I wish Stone had spent some more time fine tuning the screenplay before filming. And I wish he had spent some more time in the editing room, constructing a well-made, cohesive making a cohesive argument about why W is the way he is. Instead, because he rushed to get the film into multiplexes before the election, we have the equivalent of a television movie.

3439873,4,B0019LY5IC,"The film has a structure similar to Stone's ""Nixon"", jumping from the present to the past and then back again. The scenes that occur during the presidency focus almost entirely on the Iraq War, while W's biography begins at his Yale fraternity hazing. James Brolin does a brillant job capturing W's mannerisms and good ole boy way of talking. The youthful W is depicted as a hard drinking womanizer who can't hold a job and seems to have no direction in life. After a ""born again"" religious experience he cleans up his act and begins to have political ambitions. But apparent throughout are W's ""daddy issues"" and how he feels Poppy Bush prefers brother Jeb over him. I particularly enjoyed the dream sequence with his father near the end of the movie.

This is closer to a bio-pic than a hachet job. But it is also very much a political satire. The film had the audience laughing throughout and the jokes were mostly at W's expense. It does attempt to explain the psychological motivations behind W's actions and some viewers may leave feeling sympathy for him. But the overall portrait that emerges is of a clownish bumbler in way over his head and being manipulated by Cheney, Rumsfield and Rove into a war with sinister motivations and a tragic outcome.

Not everything that Stone tries here works and I would have preferred a linear timeline and more broadly focused account of W's inept administration that included 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, etc. But the film is entertaining enough and will serve to confirm what most Americans already know - that under W this country has definitely been heading in the wrong direction.",1224892800,6,1626,4.803571428571429
3439874,4,B0019LY5IC,"I never was, nor will be, a George W Bush enthusiast, yet I went to the movie because of the director Oliver Stone. He didn't disappoint me. It helped to understand the man, George W a bit more, and even take a liking to him. ""W"" is the absorbing story of a man who ascends the presidency without the necessary skills and experience. Being aware of it, he surrounds himself with veterans and experts of all sorts. That becomes a recipe for disaster both for him and the world. It's not a biography of the man, nor is it a political history. Stone's attempt is a character study of the most intriguing public figure of our time. It's a bit sketchy for that matter. The movie shows fragments from his presidency, interspersed with flashbacks of his youthful years. Some of the very important moments of his life, his handling of 9/11 being an example, are unfortunately left out. Yet the portrayal is complete enough for us to be able to relate to his struggles and pains, and to empathize with him, a man with good intentions surrounded by manipulative people.

The cast is superb with very few exceptions. Josh Brolin, the title character captures it almost perfectly including the mannerisms and the body language we are all familiar with. It's not easy to play the role of such a public person like the President. Josh does it effortlessly. Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) is well portrayed though he comes across more as a scheming villain than a supportive VP, which is discomforting. The characters of Karl Rove (Toby Jones), Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn), Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright), and Bush the senior (James Cromwell) are perfectly cast with credibility. Elizabeth Banks who plays Laura Bush is graceful and does justice to the first lady. Whereas Condoleezza Rice portrayed by Thandie Newton did not seem prominent enough to be convincing.

The Iraq war is a recurring theme throughout, along with the reasons for the fateful decision, the struggles and pains of the conflict, the frustrations in not finding WMDs and the personal agony of the man at the helm of affairs. But the movie is much more than that. Unlike the war, the movie ends rather abruptly and inconclusively, leaving the audience to their own final judgments. That is sure to be in favor of the film and Oliver Stone.",1224806400,4,2297,4.783375314861461

I was expecting this would also be provocative and really have an opinion about Bush. Instead, its just a boring, standard biography. No insight or and special messages.

3439876,3,B0019LY5IC,"While I am not (to put it mildly) a fan of George W. Bush, ""W"" sparked unexpected sympathy in me. I found myself thinking, ""He's not a terrible guy...if only he had stayed with just owning the Texas Rangers!"" This alone is a considerable feat, and I applaud the movie's ability to portray such a polarizing figure in a sincere, human light. However, in many ways, ""W"" was disappointing. I hoped to see a biographical film offering insight into the man and his life story, but what I got was a movie focused mainly on the Iraq War, with the message that the war was Bush's way of proving himself to (or one-upping) the father he could never seem to please. It is an interesting and believable angle, but the film's narrow focus leaves parts of Bush's story glaringly absent.

The plot bounces between the Iraq War and earlier parts of Bush's life, starting with his wild college days. We don't glean anything about the significant events of his childhood, such as the death of his little sister Robin, which is sure to have impacted him greatly. Even the most pivotal moment in Bush's presidency--9/11--is missing. I found it strange that there is a scene depicting the famous ""pretzel incident,"" but only a few brief references to 9/11 during meetings on Iraq.

The movie's strongest point is Josh Brolin's performance, which successfully captures Bush's mix of swagger, recklessness, charm, and simple-mindedness. While the film drives home the point that Bush isn't the brightest crayon in the box, Brolin portrays a man with whom we can sympathize, as he struggles to fill the very big shoes bequeathed to him by his dad. Bush is painted as a person with good intentions surrounded by people who are eager to manipulate him. Jeffrey Wright and Richard Dreyfuss do well as Colin Powell and Dick Cheney, who are shown butting heads over the war. Cheney is clearly the villain, talking openly about the need to seize Iraq's oil--and to stay there, with no exit strategy. These may very well have been Cheney's intentions, but it is still conjecture that he actually said this, and it detracts from the movie. Thandie Newton's performance as Condoleezza Rice was unconvincing, conveying none of Rice's strong personality. Maybe I'm a little biased, though; I was hoping they'd pick Simbi Khali (Nina from ""3rd Rock from the Sun""), who is such a dead ringer for Condi.

The film is not what it could have been, lacking the level of substance the subject deserves. While ""W."" is worth seeing, I would wait until it comes out on DVD or hits the discount theaters.",1224460800,8,2559,4.772009029345372

Bush, of course.  With careful attention to timing, it reaches theaters as the 2008 U.S. Presidential race is in its hot, final, attention-hogging days.  Now, anybody who knows Stone's characteristic previous work might well expect an incendiary, one-sided, unsubstantiated, hostile, even paranoid view of our 43d President.  However, Stone has here delivered a rather fair, unprejudiced view, one that even encourages a certain amount of sympathy for the movie's protagonist.

Stone has used a star-laden cast to tell this story.  James Brolin, fresh off his triumph in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>, delivers a strong, nuanced performance as the title character; as in ""No Country,"" he plays another Texan, this time one by choice.  James Cromwell is outstanding as ""Poppy,"" our 41st President, George Herbert Walker Bush; Ellen Burstyn does well as  our former First Lady, W's mom, Barbara Bush.  Richard Dreyfuss does a remarkable turn as Vice President Dick Cheney.  Scott Glenn is Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Ioan Griffith is British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Stacy Keach is scarcely recognizable as W's favorite preacher Earle Hudd.  Bruce McGill is an oily George Tenet, head of Central Intelligence Agency.  Thandie Newton scatters some grace notes as Condoleezza Rice, our current Secretary of State.  And Jeffrey Wright captures the dignity and intelligence of Colin Powell, former UN Ambassador, Secretary of State, and five star general: the man who won Gulf War I for Bush 41.

Stone seems to have stuck pretty closely this time out to what anyone who watches CNN will know.  He should get high marks for accuracy.  Unfortunately, aside from a few key early scenes, watching this film is like watching CNN: information is delivered by what amounts to talking heads.  It's a quintessential all talk no action film, and some will find it, surprisingly enough for Stone's work, dull.  In fact, it reminded me of nothing so much as those living tableaus (tableaux vivant in the original French) that used to be popular: at any moment I expected a character to come out in colonial dress, announce he was George Washington, cross the Delaware River, represented by rippling silk, and throw that coin.  Recommended only for political junkies with a high tolerance for talking heads.",1224460800,4,3364,6.783720930232558
3439878,4,B0019LY5IC,"To be honest, I am a liberal who went to this movie expecting to see a funny parody of George W. Bush along the lines of a Michael Moore film.  While I did laugh at times during the film, I left the movie feeling strangely sympathetic towards poor W.  Stone plays it surprisingly straight, presenting Bush as the kid who had trouble finding his way as a grown-up.  The main focus here is on Bush's relationship with his father, particularly his efforts to constantly try to please George the elder and falling short, especially when compared with his brother Jeb.  Stone effectively weaves in flashblacks from Bush's college and early adult years with his first term as President.  Some major events, including the 2000 election and September 11th, are given almost no attention, but again, that's not the main focus of the film.

The movie is superbly cast.  Josh Brolin does an amazing job as W.; he manages to capture Bush's mannerisms in a portrayal that is uncannily accurate without becoming a caricature.  Then there's James Cromwell, who looks and sounds nothing like George Bush senior but somehow manages to depict the former President perfectly just the same.  Most of the other supporting roles are excellent as well, from Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney to Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell; the one exception was Thandie Newton's Condoleezza Rice, who DID feel more like a caricature.

No matter which side of the aisle you find yourself on, this is an engrossing movie with the potential to appeal to many different types of people, and I definitely recommend it.",1224460800,86,1570,4.868421052631579
3439879,4,B0019LY5IC,"By the way, wasn't The Decider the nickname of one of those NASA-CAR fellas? Hehe.

Ok that's my Bush impression. It's nowhere near a good as Josh Brolin's. Brolin nails the Prez. with nuance, both young Bush and old. He doesn't really shade Bush's character, he just seems to be trying for accuracy in portraying the Prez.

And that's kind of how Oliver Stone approaches this movie. He just lets things happen and lets you decide the importnace and meaning of it all. Some people say he's too easy on Bush, some say he's too hard. This movie's like a mirror, it will refelct your own opinions of the man. Maybe that's it's purpose. Maybe it was meant not to give us the scandalous low-down but to get us to refelct on why we helped elect a man who was really not suited for the job at all. I think the big question of the movie is ""How did THIS GUY get to be the most powerful man in the Free World."" And Stone only hints at the answers. As a mater of fact, he barely hints at the questions. That's the viewer's job.

Maybe it's not a tell-all, maybe it's Stone being all Socratic-like.

 And the ending is pretty stark and frightening considering the fact that W still has a few months in office, during one of the most trying times in our country's history.",1224460800,4,1260,4.322033898305085
3439880,3,B0019LY5IC,"First, this was not as good as Oliver Stone's JFK (not even close).  That said, ""W."" takes a good look at how simple George W. Bush truly is.  A simple man who makes simple decisions, who doesn't understand the complexities of the world and who was always trying to get into his father's good graces by trying to out do his brother Jeb.

The other actors in the film (most of them top notch in their field) seemed to have trouble fitting into their roles - they all seemed stiff (those who played Condi, Rummy, Colin Powel, Cheney, etc.), but perhaps they were just meant to be background for Josh Brolin (who's performance is Oscar worthy).  I guess the title of the movie should tell me who the film is ultimately about, but I expected more from the supporting cast who came up short (in my view).

There were a few laughable moments.  One scene that stands out is when Dubbya is standing in front of his high level White House staff angrily asking where the Weapons of Mass Destruction went in Iraq which is why they decided to go to war in the first place.  He stands up shouting like a 10 year old asking his staff to tell him who was in charge (LOL).  Unbelievable.

If you've been paying attention to American politics since the 2000 presidential election, then nothing in this movie is going to surprise you.  There's no smoking gun here.  If you haven't been paying attention or just like George Bush, you're not going to walk away with anything stunning either because you're just as 1 dimensional as he is and just won't/don't get it.  Still, ""W."" is worth seeing for an interesting look into George Bush's psyche... and there ain't all that much there!  It was entertaining enough and Josh Brolin's performance was spot on.",1224374400,3,1735,4.540192926045016
3439881,4,B0019LY5IC,"Just how could a man who couldn't hold a steady job or earn an honest living until he was well into his forties become president of the USA? This is the question under examination in W., a film that fails to make much of an impact because it can't make up its mind as to what it wants to be (kind of like the young W. himself). Its not quite leftist propaganda because the portrait is too sympathetic to be dismissed as simply that but its not exactly fair and balanced either. Stone seems to be motivated by a desire to allow us unprecedented (albeit fictional) access to a complex and flawed individual (aren't we all) who has strong convictions but who at the same time is a comic figure who never takes himself that seriously and is not taken seriously by those closest to him. To a certain extent Stone makes sense of the contradictions that mark this divided man (half clown, half crusader) and the result is a personal and political comedy of errors. Substantively the film essentially gets things right: W. and most of his cabinet (Powell excepted) come across as a group of inflexible ideologues who have a world view and a plan and are just waiting for an excuse to implement it. W. is a man who comes across as a person who lives with the illusion that he's in charge but who's clearly not in charge of his facts which tell a very different story than the one he tells the American people. But the tone of this film is screwy.

The Stone we all know, the one who has himself never been one to be burdened by facts or historical accuracy, is very much present. Yes, he tells W.'s unlikely story as objectively as he knows how but Stone, not trusting American viewers to get things right (after all they elected him twice), loads the film with plenty of farcical moments just to be certain that everybody gets it. As a result the film is more like a political cartoon than an actual biopic. What confuses matters, however, is that the tone is not cosistent: some scenes are played straight and others for laughs. Ultimately, Stone is not at heart a satirist, but like W., a populist at heart and, laughs aside, he tells W.'s story as if it were a classic bit of Americana. His ""W."" is a n'er-do-well-done-good-story about a boy who inherited an unbelievable burden (the Bush legacy) but who rose to the occasion when God (no less) called him up for duty. Stone cannot deliver a straight satire because he is too much like his subject (both W. and Stone attended Yale and each answered their country's call for duty in their own way and both ultimately found themselves questioning that call). Like W. Stone the storyteller is a divided person: he's half satirist and half sap, a cynic who wants to be a believer.

The question that baffles most democrats is do republicans like Reagan and W. and McCain really see the world in such black and white ""God and America vs the world"" terms?

The question on most filmgoers mind is does Stone want to appeal to America's core beliefs with his cornball Americans-as-do-gooders-gone-wrong narratives or does he want to take them to task for failing to acknowledge their own gullibility at having been taken in by such thinking?

I don't think Stone himself (who admires and trades in Americans-as-innocents narratives but who also condemns the effects of such thinking) can decide.",1224374400,3,3332,4.594957983193277

3439883,4,B0019LY5IC,"Here's an odd little movie.  It's a kitchen sink drama about a sitting President of the United States.  Yes, it's got stock footage of the Iraq war, and an all-star casting playing members of the Cabinet, and it's got a greatest-hits collection of everyone's favorite George W. Bush misquotes.  But it's also a sad, downbeat little drama about a man-child who failed at everything he ever did, and then became President just to prove a point to his father -- and failed at that, too.

Oliver Stone's movie has been praised so far for not being overtly political, and for being somewhat sympathetic to its subject.  Still, the director doesn't pull punches on showing ""W""'s hard-drinking past, and he lists all of the man's life failures prior to becoming owner of the Texas Rangers.  There are a few trademark manipulative Stone moments -- for example, a pan over the infamous ""Mission Accomplished"" poster quickly jump-cuts to a montage of Iraq insurgent bombshells and wounded veterans.  We also get the moment where the Prseident nearly chokes on a pretzel while watching college football on TV.  And, even though Bush did win the 2004 election, the movie stops short of that in order to end on a surprisingly downbeat note.  This movie is sympathetic to Bush, but it's also quite critical.  There's a fleeting image of John McCain, too, lest we forget the choice we have to make in a couple of weeks.

The cast is almost uniformly superb.  Josh Brolin, playing Bush both in his hard-living 20s and his Presidential late 50s, carries off the role so effortlessly that it's easy to overlook how hard he had to work to make this movie work.  And it does work, thanks to Brolin.

The aces of the supporting cast include James Cromwell as George H.W. Bush -- giving the man a true gravitas that pop culture denied him 15 years ago, when he was being parodied by Dana Carvey and ""The Simpsons"".  Jeffrey Wright is heroic as Colin Powell.  Finally, Richard Dreyfuss's interpretation of Dick Cheney merits serious Oscar consideration.  No over-the-top trademark Dreyfuss moments here.  He is superb lurking in the shadows and lording over a map of oil wells in the Middle East.

I only had two disappoinments walking out of the theater.  One was the limited scope of the movie.  There's no mention of what history will really recall about the Bush presidency: the questions surrounding the 2000 and 2004 elections; the moment of triumph at Yankee Stadium shortly following 9/11; the Hurricane Katrina debacle.  Of course, by including all that Stone would have been wide open to charges of political bias, and then this wouldn't have been a family film about a son vainly struggling to impress his father.

The other disappointment was Thandie Newton.  With a vicious sneer on her face and a strange choice of enunciation, her Condi Rice is more a caricature than a portrayal.  Had the movie been more overtly political or had the other supporting actors also mocked their characters, I might not have noticed.  But here, Thandie was as overshadowed by the rest of the cast as has George W. Bush been overhshadowed by his father.",1224288000,25,3125,4.816135084427767

3439885,5,B0019LY5IC,"Oliver Stone's ""W."" is one of the year's most absorbing films, and that's because, as the tagline suggests, it reveals that George W. Bush has been greatly misunderestimated. Watching this film, we see not the forty-third President of the United States, the former Governor of Texas, or even a politician in general. From my perspective, we're being told about an insecure man who reaches too far in an attempt to earn his father's approval. This movie is not a political commentary--it's a character study. Better still, it's a character study that's more or less historically accurate, with Stone and writer Stanley Weisner relying on published works and in-depth reports for the screenplay. Liberties were obviously taken; after all, there's no way anyone could know exactly what was said behind closed doors. But all the basic scenarios are well documented, which is to say that the film never once felt contrived. The end result is a compelling, complex, and occasionally funny examination of a person who always has something to prove.

Josh Brolin is perfectly cast as the title character, flawlessly capturing the mannerisms and diction we've become so familiar with over the last eight years. We see him as a determined but incompetent man who claws his way up to the presidency without the necessary skills. Pay close attention to scenes featuring W. in staff meetings; it quickly becomes clear that political heavyweights like Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss), Karl Rove (Toby Jones), Condoleeza Rice (Thandie Newton), Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright), and even the infuriated Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn) are making all the important decisions. As for W., well, let us not forget that the real President Bush publicly declared that his faith in God influenced his foreign policy decisions. In the film, he ends every meeting by having everyone bow their heads in prayer; I expected nothing less from a man who found God at age forty, when he was in the thick of his AA treatment. In 1999, he tells his pastor (Stacy Keach) that, even though he had no desire to be President of the United States, it was God's will that he campaign.

The film also takes some time to develop the relationship between W. and his wife, Laura (Elizabeth Banks), who he met at a friend's barbecue while running for Congress for the first time. In the film, Laura Bush is sweet, understanding, and patient, and it's easy to believe the love she feels for her husband. She seems to regard W. the same way a mother regards a baby taking its first steps: She encourages him endlessly, and she's always there to support him if he should trip and fall somewhere along the way. At that pivotal stage of W.'s life, the world of politics is so new and challenging that he needs all the support he can get.

One of the most interesting things about this film is the structure. Rather than a complete chronological biography, Stone opted for non-linear fragments, starting in 2002 but then flashing back to 1966 before going to 2003, and so on and so forth. He also chose to omit specific events in Bush's life; we see neither the 2000 nor the 2004 election, and we're spared the tragedies of September 11, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina. This will undoubtedly frustrate certain audiences. I didn't have a problem with it, and that's because this film is about his personality, not his political career. As the pieces of the story come together, we discover the man behind the president: he was a C-average college student who spent most of his time getting drunk; he gambled and went through women; he seemed to take no interest in holding a job; he was always at odds with his disapproving parents, who seemed to favor his younger brother, Jeb.

There's a moment in a 1970s flashback when W. comes home drunk and announces that he was accepted into Harvard Business School. When his mother (Ellen Burstyn) demands to know why he never told them, he admits that he never intended to go--he just wanted to prove to his father (James Cromwell) that he could do it. This doesn't please Poppy Bush very much, and that's because it was his own string pulling that got his son accepted in the first place. There's a definite rivalry between the two, one that W. drags all the way to 2003, the year he decided to invade Iraq. Colin Powell, who in 1991 oversaw Operation Desert Strom along with Dick Cheney, makes it clear that Saddam Hussein had no hand in the 9/11 attacks. That doesn't matter, decides W.; he wants to finish the job his father failed to finish back when he was President. Besides, there's evidence to suggest that Hussein is concealing weapons of mass destruction.

But I'm not convinced he actually believed this to be true. It seemed more likely that he was just going along with what others were saying. Oliver Stone describes George W. Bush as a Western hero so one-tracked, he refuses to back down even when he's wrong. ""There's just no examination of the interior life,"" he said in an ""L.A. Weekly"" interview. ""He doesn't look back. He doesn't regret. He doesn't seem to read very much--or think very much--about what he does."" Some may be compelled to take pity on W. after seeing this movie; it paints a picture of a man who wanted nothing more than to own a baseball team. Others, I'm sure, will not have their minds changed one bit. Whatever your reaction, I personally feel that this is one of the year's best films, presenting us with a fascinating character study rather than a scathing political commentary.",1224201600,121,5505,4.784437434279705

George W. sported cowboy hats, consumed burgers and beers, and boozed it up with broads at bars unlike his father who was the consummate intellectual New Englander, although both went to Yale. The present bio-pic is a kind of montage of the life of George W. Bush, interspersing scenes from his presidency with those of his formative years.

Josh Brolin offers one of the best performances of his career, portraying the younger W. Bush as a carousing adolescent whose irresponsibility with booze is only matched by his exceptional driving techniques, which involve swerving through streets and running into things. Some of the best scenes are Bush's early years where appears almost diametrically opposite from his prominent father. While his father (James Cromwell in an equally compelling performance) was tempered and intellectual, Bush is the free-wheeling party animal. His first ""test"" is when he rushes Delta Kappa Epsilon, a Yale fraternity, where during a hazing, he's able to outdo his fellow rushers. (Legend has it the character of Bluto from ""Animal House"" was based on George W. when he was a member of the Yale frat house!) He is portrayed as a directionless scatterbrain, unable to hold down jobs and careers for any length of time. Unlike his steady father, W.'s drinking continually worsens, and he often proposes to women he barely knows.

Frequently, we fast-forward to the Bush presidency. Richard Dreyfus is outstanding as Dick Cheney, and honorable mention goes to Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell. His presidency is as scattered as his adolescent years, not quite knowing who is doing what in his cabinet. There is a sense that others with more intellect than himself are actually calling the shots behind his back. In an interesting early scene, during lunch with the Vice President, Cheney proposes a ""hypothetical"" scenario in which the President takes it too literally and compromises his sandwich as a result!

Back in the formative years, Bush volunteers to help his father in his presidential bid. And then has life-changing experience after he's boozed it up hard one night. He goes on a jog which does not go as planned and by the end of the sequence, he's rubbing shoulders with Evangelicals. Eventually he would convert, help to bring out the Evangelical vote in favor of his father in 1988, and become governor of Texas in 1994. And then he would run for president.

A thoroughly entertaining film which ponders more questions than it answers. Who was the real George W.? In a few places, we see W. standing in the middle of an empty baseball field, trying to catch an imagined fly ball. Every time the scene returns, the ball is more uncatchable. Which maybe speaks to various aspects of W. Was it that he couldn't quite catch the life he desired? Or maybe he was over-reaching? Or maybe the figure of W. is us, and the ball represents him, and we can't quite grasp him? Certainly not Stone's best film, but a good one.",1522368000,,3236,4.867513611615245
