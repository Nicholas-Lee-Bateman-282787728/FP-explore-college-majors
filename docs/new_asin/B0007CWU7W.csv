8046896,3,B0007CWU7W,THE SERVICE WAS FAST. THE DVD WAS DISAPPOINTING. THERE IS MAYBE 20 PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHICH IS PROBABLY AT A FREE CONCERT. IT LOOKED LIKE A BOOTLEG THAT HAD BEEN RUN OFF SOMEONES PC WITH A PHOTOCOPIED JACKET. UNSURE WHY IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE AT $50.00. NOW WE KNOW WHY.,1108857600,4,271,4.333333333333333
8046897,5,B0007CWU7W,"I remember seeing Pat Travers open for Rainbow at the Los Angeles Forum in 1981 and Travers literally left everyone drained and lifeless for Rainbow!! It is good to see he is still ""Makin' Magic"" over 20 years later and this DVD is just great to see! Clear audio and viideo, raw and truly live without studio overdubs the way live DVD's SHOULD BE!!! Highly recommend and if you get to see his live show in your town GO FOR IT!!! Sure to please! Thanks and worth every penny of the $75!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1108425600,,499,4.434782608695652
