The Robert Wood Foundation in NY called me for my story and told me that it was going to be the inspiration for a Hallmark movie.  Both actresses did a wonderful job.

195294,5,1574927302,This is my all time favorite movie. I've tried to find it on DVD with no luck. It is a wonderful movie about the human spirit and how one never knows how our actions and care affects those lives that we come in contact with.

195297,5,1574927302,This is my favorite of Hallmark films. It is a great story of two women and the lives they have lived and are living. It is a heart-felt drama that will leave you wanting more of the story. Get the tissue out! I can recommend this movie for the whole family. It does have a couple of intense scenes though.,1197936000,,306,4.116666666666666
195298,5,1574927302,"This is a touching and very realistic movie.  As I get older I can identify so much with how tender the heart is; how fragile our lives really are and how loss is so hard to get over.  Two strangers brought together serendipitously help each other get over the great losses of their lives, each one teaching the other to see the value they have left, if they'll only just recognize it.",1195084800,5,385,4.333333333333333

This movie is very realistic and sweet. All of the characters are very interesting and inspiring. I am a fan of both of these women and I have been waiting years to see this film. It has humor, truth and a sweet sense of humanity. Enjoy!!!",1510963200,,440,4.313253012048193
7798658,4,1574927302,"Probably should give another star for the seller.  However, the movie itself is very disappointing.  I had seen the stage play and absolutely loved it.  The movie is quite different and not as entertaining nor poignant.  I gave it away.",1449532800,,236,4.825
