Because a United States Ambassador to a ""Central American"" country is kidnapped by rebels, U.S. military personnel will be deployed to the nation unless former Vietnam veteran and jungle fighter Steve Parrish (Ron Marchini) can effect a rescue of the official.  Parrish sneaks into a prison to remove a rebel leader in order to use him as hostage and exchange bait for the Ambassador, with the pair, not surprisingly joined by an attractive young female rebel, then battling through jungle terrain against numerous enemies from two armed groups.  California based Marchini is well-known to karate tournament enthusiasts and, since he also wrote and produced this low-budget affair (shot mainly near the scenic Los Banos area of the Philippines), it is essentially a showcase for his martial arts skills, as he bests scores of Filipino extras, some of whom are slain more than once, but he is a dramatic cipher, displaying a total lack of emotional range both when battling feckless foes or wooing willing females, his wooden expression actually becoming comical during the course of this poorly dubbed and tritely written work.",1113004800,,1174,5.168421052631579
