8095043,3,B000C1F5XY,"I watched this movie and from the beginning, it looked like ""Indiana Jones Raiders Of The Lost Ark.""  I'm not sure which movie came first.  ""Scorpion"" looks a lot older, but the box says 1988.  ""Raiders"" came out in 1981.  ""Raiders"" is a lot better.  Same booby traps, same snake-filled pit.  Same get captured when come out of the pit... There is even someone using a bullwhip in both.  ""Scorpion"" has a long prison section where the catalyst is that the main character is coerced into looking for Cleopatra's lost treasure in exchange for his freedom from the prison.  Then, while looking for the treasure, the antagonist dies (though the main character doesn't know this), so there is no real reason for him to return to the prison and share the treasure... but I won't spoil the ending - just don't get your hopes up.  This movie also had some flecks of ""Romancing The Stone,"" and ""The Jewel Of The Nile,"" for it's sailing and desert prison scenes.  (Those movies were better than ""Scorpion,"" also.)",1391990400,,1003,4.68
