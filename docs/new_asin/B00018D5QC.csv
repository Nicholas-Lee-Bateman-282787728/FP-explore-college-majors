The music is perfect for each scene the story is deep really deep lots of hidden secrets like if you put all the dvd cases together the first letter of each title spells ""LOGOUT"" I mean that is just mind blowing to me and the 2 extra episodes...wow Intermezzo I mean talk about a trip ending at the end I didn't see that one even coming. To sum the whole series up in one word ""WOW"" buy the games they will make you like the series even more and with twilight coming out it will only get deeper.",1078444800,,656,4.00763358778626

The last 4 episodes of the series really picks up leading to shocking ""conclusion"" (which continues in the PS2 games).
The limited edition version contains a second DVD with second bonus episode entitled ""Unison"" which you won't get in the standard version.  This episode contains a mix of characters from //Sign and the PS2 games and takes place after the games.
The LE version is cheaper than the standard one and you get a bonus episode.  There should be no question on which one to get.

1976999,3,B00018D5QC,"Hack Sign: Volume 6: Terminus contains the last three episodes of the fascinating cyber conspiracy-mystery anime series, plus two unrelated episodes.  Many questions raised during the series were not answered to my satisfaction.  Endings just happened too quickly.  What should have been a well thought-out conclusion became smarmy - almost Disneyfied - in its lame preaching about love and friendship.

The extras are lame as well.  We have two unrelated episodes, one that tells us about Mimiru's mentor in the world, a mysterious, seemingly all-powerful female warrior.  She has a crush on a college guy playing in the world.  There are hints it could have been . . . Bear?

The other extra episode is of clips of the series.  I watched it, hoping it would answer some of my questions, but alas, I feel I have been logged off of the World before I was ready.",1129161600,4,861,4.802721088435374

1977001,5,B00018D5QC,"I've watched A LOT of anime way before it became mainstream, so I have had a sample of all the good stuff that made it here before the crappy kids shows. Neon Genesis is a supurd anime, you can't call yourself an anime lover before you watch that, however as much as I liked that anime, I LOVE .hack//SIGN. This sotry is slower moving, you see mostly character development and none of that bloody violence that is prevolent in most anime and other media. If you love getting involved with the characters you'll love this. Every person alive can relate to at least one of the characters in .hack, it's amazing to watch it and see how their lives play out. Even better, if you like this anime enough, there are four games to play that take place 6 months after this story. They pick up where it left off and solve the riddles that are left unsolved at the end of this series. Now I have to say that to be an true anime fan you have to have watched 2 series, Neon Genesis Evangelion and of course, .hack//SIGN! ^_^ \/",1090454400,3,1014,4.286458333333333
1977002,1,B00018D5QC,"Yes it is. I have watched all of the dvd's and this show is by far one of the worst!!! I dispise the voice acting!!! the story is awful!!! This show really does not deserve to be this famous! It has comics, anime, videogames, etc. etc. etc.!!! I advise everyone to skip .Hack entirely!!!
I great anime I recommend would be Last Exile!!!",1087948800,2,336,4.349206349206349
1977003,4,B00018D5QC,"A triumphant victory - and a shattering tragedy - mark the emotionally charged final volume of SIGN.
The storyline can be roughly sectioned into three parts.  In the first, the older party members consult with Helba to try to develop a strategy to finally defeat The Voice.  Their personal subplots are wrapped up as - among other things - B.T. seems to have finally realized she's been overlooking another good man while she's been futiley setting her cap for Crim, and Bear makes Tsukasa a touching if somewhat expected offer regarding the real world.
The second involves the final physical battles of the series as the party faces Tsukasa's Guardian - losing their best fighter right out of the gate when Crim has to break off the second the crisis begins to finish things once and for all with Sora, who still doesn't understand exactly how serious the situation is.
Finally, the younger party members take center stage as they face a battle of wills with The Voice to wake Aura, the sleeping girl - and presumably thereby free Tsukasa.  The Voice does not take opposition lightly - and success will not come without a dear price...
The story is not wrapped up completely, designed to segue straight into the four Playstation 2 video games in the .hack franchise.  But it ends in a place that gives you enough to work with to make up your own mind about what happens after the bittersweet conclusion if you don't want to play the games - and that's good enough for me.
With a final 15 minutes that pay off for those who have invested time in the fates of these characters, SIGN fans will not be disappointed.",1084492800,9,1612,4.625874125874126
1977004,5,B00018D5QC,"The .hack series wouldn't be right if it didn't end with a knock down, drag out boss beating fight.  Subaru, Tsukasa, and the rest of the players take up arms against their mysterious opponent - Morganna.  As they foil plans and counter moves, Morganna's rage grows and The World becomes dangerous enough to threaten the real world.  Aura must be born to save the game, and for that to happen Tsukasa must discover his true identity and find a way to log out.
This is the first grand battle for the mind space of the net, and success is defined by more than increased player levels.  Deeper qualities of character are needed to prevail.  Real courage must replace skill points.  Expect a few surprises as several characters reveal their true natures.  And a strong ending
To make up for there being only three series episodes, this DVD provides to additional episodes.  'Intermezzo' is an interesting side arc that covers some of Mimiru's own story.  With Tsukasa and Subaru's relationship taking the foreground in the series itself, this is an unexpected insight into one or the series most interesting characters.  Finally, 'Evidence' is a retelling of the main story line with some additional touches of detail that underline the poignant core of the story.
This series has shown consistent strength in concept and story.  While it didn't take quite the turns I thought it would it has shown an independent creativity beyond that defined in the game portion of this series.  Not every thread is completely resolved, but most a brought within the sphere of imagination.  Which is, of course, one of the key themes of the story.",1081900800,14,1629,4.837545126353791
1977005,5,B00018D5QC,".hack//SIGN-Terminus is by far the best .hack DVD out there. If you are a true .hack fan then you simply must by this DVD. It contains episodes 23-25 (all of the last episodes) plus 2 bonus episodes. The bonus episodes are ""Intermezzo"", which focuses on Mimiru and why she plays The World the way she does. The second episode is ""Evidence"" which was broadcasted earlier in the .hack//SIGN series. This DVD is pretty awesome, but if you buy the limited edition .hack//SIGN Terminus DVD, you will also recieve an extra DVD that comes with an extra episode ""Unison"".
Unison brings all of the characters from .hack//SIGN and the .hack video games together in conclusion to the first seoson of .hack and eventually leads up to the second season. I give this product a 6 out of 5 (its that great) and recommend it to any .hack fan.",1079827200,14,825,4.619047619047619
1977006,5,B00018D5QC,"its Tsukasa, not ""Tsubasa"", lol",1078876800,4,31,5.4
1977007,5,B00018D5QC,"Obviously, those who are buying this DVD have followed the series.  .hack//SIGN was designed to be a TV series that flows into a video game series, and in Japan they released their product in a row so you can follow the story from beginning to end.  In America, the series of SIGN jumped out of the gate around the same time the first video game was relased.  Sadly, you couldn't follow the series in America and then plpay the games unless you waited until now (or watched SIGN on Cartoon Network through the summer of 2003) and then play the games.  This is the biggest fault of Bandai America.  Aside from that, this has been a very interesting, and progressively experimental ride.
.hack//SIGN  creates major ripples in people participating in the WORLD (on-line game) as they try to understand the enigma of Tsukasa, who appears to be a comatose player caught in the game.  While the actual workings of this phenomena (the comas) isn't explained in the series, or the game, or game OVAs, it is explained in the final series/installment called .hack//Twilight's Bracelt being released soon by Bandai.  And once explained, it still doesn't make much sense; assuming the personality in the game is AI, how does Tsukasa regain the computer's memories outside the game when awakened?  With headsets, it doesn't play that there is a psychic bond since this universe is about straightforward technology and AI, and not about mysticism.  Aside from that, the story works well.  A great amount of care in writing and  drawing draws detail to words and expressions instead of battles/terror/sex/adventure, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level.  This is one of the few anime where you feel words count and people are actually talking to each other, and relating in  the myriad emotional ways they do in real life with body language, expression, subtext and so on.  THE WORLD is merely a mask for the player (the end credits portray this) as the body is a mask for the mind and will of a person; the parallels are nice.  The biggest pity was not seeing the poeple outside the game more, but that wasn't the story and would have hurt the impact of the final scenes which sum up the series- people reaching for each other but never QUITE connecting.
The games go beyond this series as Aura is awake and fleeing from Skieth and the vengeful mother who wants her dead.  While the game spends most of your time wandering levels fighting monsters, it has tidbits of story thrown in to progress the entire experience above a mere game and into a saga.  The game also explains the fate or further experiences of the characters from SIGN.  Sora's dilemma is resolved in the 3rd game.  While you don't get to play with any of the SIGN characters until the end of the 4th game, you will meet some of the SIGN characters and get weapons from them as you succeed at levels where the story progresses.  I believe you see all the characters at some point, as well as seeing ghosts of them spouting lines from the series in the root towns.
It is sad to see the series end, despite the two extra episodes.  It would be great to continue this well written, tho under animated, series.  For the blood/sex/death/action/mecha crowd, this series was probably frustrating and obnoxious because the subtlety needs the viewer to attempt a connection with the anime.  SIGN was not an anime that lashes out with splendor and mayhem, but pays off in a different way.",1078790400,19,3436,4.697829716193656

My package arrived completely askew; the case lay in shambles and shards of plastic, and the box had been shredded. Thank goodness the disks themselves were fine, but I am very upset. I had to trash all the packaging, because it was entirely ruined; and to me, the package is why I didn't just torrent this or something. But whatever, at least I have the disks.
It still ruined my day, though. Especially because all I got from the USPS was a note saying: ""WE ARE SORRY."", with no solution, or refund for the shipping. Is that what I payed for?

Again, though, I rated this with 5 stars, because the seller did nothing wrong; just the lousy, bankrupt, postal service.",1286841600,,743,4.544776119402985

8007914,5,B00018D5QC,"Please note that my purpose in writing this is NOT to review the .hack//Sign series, but describe the different endings contained in this Limited Edition set; so there is a SPOILER ALERT of sorts.  As is becoming all-too-usual, Amazon makes NO attempt at sorting out reviews of the REGULAR Vol. 6 - Terminus and the LIMITED EDITION of the same, so most of what you see in the reviews here fails to adequately describe either.  The ONLY difference between the two is the presence of a second disc in the Limited Edition - but what a difference it makes!

Terminus consists of 5 episodes, confusingly out-of-order: the first 3 essentially complete the SIGN arc of what has become a maddeningly massive series of .hack video games, TV series, and OAV's.  In them we have a resolution of sorts to Tsukasa's dilemma of being trapped inside the games, finally emerging into the ""real"" world where SHE is united with Subaru's player.  But in the Extras there are 2 additional ""bonus"" episodes, numbered 26 and 27.  The trouble with this is that so-called Episode 27, ""Evidence"", ACTUALLY occurrs much earlier in the run as the dreaded ""recap"" episode so beloved of anime producers as extraneous ( and cost-saving ) ""filler"".  It serves to review events in the story thus far as Subaru tries to sort out the conflicting opinions of the other players ( and herself ) regarding Tsukasa's place within The World.  Instead of leaving it where it belongs in the story ( and makes sense ), Bandai has moved it here LAST where it serves NO useful function at all.  Extra Episode 26, ""Intermezzo"", is nothing of the sort; but instead was a stand-alone OAV issued to further round out the character of Mimiru.  In it she and Bear form their usual party to revisit a dungeon important to her past as a player in The World.  It's worthwhile, entertaining, and well-done; but has no bearing whatever on the SIGN arc, serving much like filler between the arcs of the series.

The Bonus disc in the Limited Edition, however is essential to the greater understanding of the .hack universe, though it contains only a single regular-length episode, ""Unison"".  This in fact was also originally issued as an OAV, and effectively links and completes both .hack//Sign and the video games which follow it.  ( It also somewat serves as a sort of bridge to the far inferior .hack//Legend of the Twilight series which in turn followed them. )  Even if you haven't had any experience of the PlayStation 2 games and are unfamilliar with their characters, you will be able to follow the logic behind them.  It is here ( and here ONLY ) where we see the united casts of both the series and the games celebrating their final victory over Morganna.  Kite, BlackRose, Mistral, Mia, Balmung, and Orca from the games join Tsukasa, Subaru, Mimiru, Bear, B.T., Crim, Ginkan, and even Sora in the notorious party hosted by Helba in CyberSlum described in other reviews.  Loose ends between several of the characters in Sign are tied up, and Aura puts in an appearance that is like a benediction on the proceedings, giving it a most satisfactory ending that is otherwise lacking in the Regular Edition.",1240012800,2,3156,4.749084249084249
