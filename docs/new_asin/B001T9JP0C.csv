3788607,3,B001T9JP0C,"This film was a bit too focused on a few characters and their personal conflicts to capture the bigger story. The EP were a resistance movement inside Germany of German youth who, by this account, were taking on the various elements of the German state, including the Gestapo. That's just amazing to contemplate. Presumably, there were thousands of EP, so zeroing in on one group of a dozen or so fails to reflect the scope of the movement.

3788613,4,B001T9JP0C,I love anything about the real lives of ordinary Europeans and ie Germans during ww2 etc. I had never heard of anything like this so I was very interested to see it.

3788614,4,B001T9JP0C,"The rubble for 1944 Cologne was very authentic.. Some audience members have the problem of confusion between Gestapo, SD, Hitler youth and SS. This is primarily about the Edelweiss Pirates (a youth gang) that was contrary to Nazism and their street battles with the Hitler youth. It runs maybe a little too much into fantasy to be completely believable but on the whole it is pretty well presented. Of course the Gestapo come off as just mean, it would be impossible to truly represent them. This is a pretty good character study and worth the time invested for that alone.",1471824000,,573,4.74

3788632,5,B001T9JP0C,The seemingly endless points of view on the Nazi atrocities and how people resisted those horrors never ceases to amaze me. This movie documents a group of teenagers who chose to do what they could to stick a thumb in the eyes of the Nazis until someone sold them out.

Remeber, the Nazis were socialists who loved social engineering, gun control, intense surveillance of all citizens and scapegoating people who didn't agree with them. It wasn't just Jews in the camps. Catholics, Protestents, Romany, homosexuals, union officials and political prisoners made up nearly half of those killed in camps. Think FEMA camps. He, like obama, aligned himself closely with Islamic armies in eastern europe. There was even an Islamic SS Division run by the grand mufti and the those problems are still with us in Crotia, Bosnia, etc. movies like this show how evil a Socialist regime can be in the disguise of national saviors.",1433808000,2,806,5.113636363636363

3788656,5,B001T9JP0C,Not every German supported the Nazis regime. The Gestapo was brutal in its treatment of any one who dared to speak out against Hitler or the war effort. Too many young idealists were sacrificed to keep the war effort going.,1427328000,3,223,4.6

3788663,5,B001T9JP0C,I was not aware of the Edelweiss Pirates movement in Germany.  Showed the brutality of the SS and a revealing look the movement started by German Youth that did not want to be part of the strict Hitler Youth which placed you into the Army at 17.  There were street fights between the Hitler Youth and the Edelweiss Pirates.  Great reflection on that time period.,1425081600,9,362,4.538461538461538

But when one group of these working class ""Edelweiss Pirates"" rescues a prisoner from bomb-disposal detail, his desire for revenge begins to convince them that despite the Fascist police state's power, their talk can become action... with tragic consequences for the naive kids.

No feel-good ending here, which seems to be true to the real stories on which the movie is (roughly) based. Still, a compelling movie.",1417996800,13,562,5.0978260869565215

Why? Because films such as these would have us believe that the vast majority of Germans opposed nazism, hid two Jews in their basement up until the bitter end, heroically fought against their own government from 1933 till 1945, and so on. It did not happen this way. For real history, read Ladislas Farrago, William Shirer, and other well respected historians. However, stay away from films--with few exceptions, the vast majority contain serious historical errors; and with very few exceptions they made be filed within the ""Dreck"" category.",1518048000,,725,5.100840336134453

They are nothing like the partisan movements in Italy, Norway, France, and of course Russia. It felt like I was watching a group of juvenile delinquents face the consequences of their crimes. Even the Gestapo was played to campy effect: since when do they announce their presence during entry of a property by saying ""Secret Police!"". It's ridiculous. They didn't refer to themselves that way.

The Gestapo man was right about Peter. The kid was ""weak"" because he acted like a Nazi; he stood rigidly by his pal and admitted no wrongdoing, thus getting himself killed. The woman should have been hung, as she had an arsenal under her floor, hiding Jews, and was prepared to spread Communist propaganda. She would have been shot on the spot in most cases, but those meanie Gestapo men cut her a brake. Really no 'good guys' in this movie.
