8293434,4,B001DIBZAW,"Sequel to Kidulthood, with the same characters, six years older, and a few new younger ones thrown in.  You don't need to have seen the first necessarily to follow events in this one, but you won't really appreciate the hatred and references to their younger selves the characters bring up when taunting one another if you don't watch Kidulthood first. It also give away major spoilers for the first film.

This sequel has more of a plot than the first film, basically a young man is out on parole after doing time for what happened at the end of Kidulthood.  He of course become old enough to be an adult during his incarceration and spent a lot of his sentence with other violent men, where he learnt he wasn't the tough guy he thought he was.  He wants to move on with his life, but at a cemetery has to fight for his life with a stranger after revenge.  He learns that there is a price on his head but doesn't know who.  He's going to have to reluctantly mix with those from his former life who he'd ruled over like a thug to get the information and end the threat.  Problem now they are adults some have moved on from the pathetic way of life they lived, they don't want to help him and return to it, and others such as the white British kid who wanted to be a black American ghetto kid from the first film are still trying to live that dream and blame the fact that they haven't achieved that, on him, obviously too cowardly to do the hit themselves, employs younger dumb kids to do the job for him.  Of course killing someone isn't as easy as this new wave of teen gangsta wannabes thinks it will be.",1483142400,,1607,4.2631578947368425

8293436,4,B001DIBZAW,"When's the last time you saw a movie in which the protagonist is played by the same guy who wrote AND directed the film? While that sounds like a potential recipe for disaster, the ambitious Noel Clarke pulled it off handily in Adulthood.

 Solid acting. If you only know Clarke from his role as Mickey Smith in Doctor Who (2005-2010), then you'll be stunned to see his character here (Sam), who is worlds apart (pun intended) from the somewhat goofy Mickey Smith. Scarlett Alice Johnson does an amazing job as Lexi, the young woman Sam lets down his guard for; her role here will break your heart, but also leaves you hopeful that there is someone out there in this world for every individual. Adam Deacon adeptly reprises his role of the loose cannon who has become consumed by events that went down in Kidulthood.
 Good pacing. There are plenty of moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, but there is also time to reflect on all the emotions of Sam and the people he interacts with, and the reasons for those emotions.
 There are some creative split screen scenes that are implemented to great effect.

Surely there will be some who dismiss Adulthood as a presentation gratuitously glamorizing the hoodlum lifestyle, but these viewers would be missing the point entirely. Noel Clarke is a perceptive and perhaps introspective man who does not lose sight of the forest for the trees. The final message of Adulthood is that vicious cycles must be broken, and Clarke presents this argument in a dramatic, compelling, and cinematic way.",1430524800,,1543,4.742537313432836

8293438,5,B001DIBZAW,"I saw kidulthood on Netflix and had to buy the sequel on amazon, finally got it and was extremely excited. Unwrapped the blu ray DVD put it into my USA spec ps3 and....... It would not play due to the region code Smfh. I'm aggravated because I can tell this is a great movie I just paid for that I cannot watch, and I even paid full price, extremely disappointed.",1365206400,,363,4.2
8293439,5,B001DIBZAW,"I watched this movie last night because, quite frankly, there was nothing else to watch on TV. It was made in London with London actors. Why me!! After watching it for nearly five minutes with remote in hand, I quickly put the remote down, but I kept it close to me just in case.

That ""just in case"" did not come. I found myself in tuned to what was going on. I tried to figure out what would happen in the next scene but the way that it was written, the inevitable happened and then in some scenes the unimaginable happened. I think that it is an absolute rarity to see such well written work from a young man these days.

This movie explored not only the struggles of the main character, but of his mother, brother, the friends of the murdered youth, the murdered youth's uncle and the young lady that had issues of drug abuse and clinical depression, who by the way had conspired with others to set Noel up. Oh, she was in love with him also.

Anyway, this a great film. It is of street life, but it also depict how each of us choose to remain stagnant or rise above the circumstances that happens to be a hindrance. It is a damn good piece of work! I look forward to viewing more of this young man's work. As you can tell, I must have truly enjoyed the movie because I am on this site trying to find the DVD, but all that was found was Blu Ray. Damn!!

Before I end this post, I would simply like to say that if you want to view a movie that is packed with ailments of the world, watch this movie. If you simply want to watch a movie that does not contain any bias, watch this movie. Lastly, if you want to watch a movie that have fine ass men, please watch this movie. Noel Clark is a fine ass Black man. Damn if I lived in London and was 18 years younger, I would go in search of him. He is so sexy and handsome!!",1360713600,,1820,4.061281337047354
8293440,4,B001DIBZAW,"As the follow-up to Kidulthood, Adulthood continues the saga of drug, violence and sex-crazed London youth.  Directed and starring Noel Clarke (of Dr. Who fame), Adulthood takes a graphic look at the London the BBC does not want the rest of the world to know exists.  Loads of profane language, overt sexual scenes, and violence.",1259107200,,329,4.963636363636364
8293441,3,B001DIBZAW,"Continuing story of a dark existence in the modern UK, fuelled with drugs and full-scale sex (always abrupt near-the-peak-of-an-action) as seven years on school-buddies had grown up into nothing-to-do young people of ""racial foreigners"" status in London.

8293442,5,B001DIBZAW,"6 years after the incidents of Kidulthood, Sam (Noel Clark) is released from prison a new man. He regrets what he does and wants to move on with his life, the only problem being is that some of the friends and family of Trife haven't forgotten. Since that dreadful night, everyone involved has been forced to do some growing up but some of those have grown up with the bitterness and anger boiling up inside them.

Jay (Adam Deacon), one of the closest friends of Trife is truly after revenge so he pays someone to kill Sam. Along the way, knowing that people are after him Sam seeks to not only find out who's trying to kill him but make amends for the lives he's destroyed.

This is a truly immensely real film, it doesn't hold back in showing you the violent lives of London's inner city youth. I never thought I'd root for the bad guy but seeing the power in Noels performance, playing a man who truly wants to end the violence it truly came through. Although the actors are playing kids in late teens to early twenties, I was surprised by the age of some of the actors especially Noel. Maybe it's just his acting power but with him being 33 I was genuinely surprised that I couldn't actually question the age of the character he was playing.

Anyway, enough of that. I'll just wrap it up with this. People will say that this is a negative view of inner city childhood and doesn't accurately portray the lives of such kids. Others will say it's possibly the most accurate depiction you're going to get in a nation wide movie. I would go with the latter, it's frighteningly realistic and somewhat unfortunate. Noel Clark is a truly talented man, not just as an actor but as a writer/director.

I would strongly recommend this to any film fan, fans of the original Kidulthood or just kids looking to learn a thing or two. In regards to tackling this type of culture, why not show this film in schools? It may not have the biggest impact but it would certainly show the repercussions of such behaviour.",1232150400,4,2003,4.46448087431694
