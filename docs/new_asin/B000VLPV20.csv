Endless laughs and a heart that is a big as the Christmas Star. This is not shown that I know of on American television.  Buy it!  It is worth it!  Buy it and share it  / loan to other people,  It is 10x better than the average Christmas Movie  I love this film.  Oneof the best Christmas theme movies I have ever seen.  And I have seen over 300!",1505001600,,494,3.938775510204082
