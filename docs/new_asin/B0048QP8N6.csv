4286966,5,B0048QP8N6,"Perhaps the number 1 English language comedy.  This is not subtle humor (sex talk and innuendo dominate) and the language is typically English and un-edited, thus may not be for everyone.  However, I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so often.

A tip that I passed on before.  Purchase for +-$40 a region free DVD player and purchase non USA DVD's from Amazon UK.  The savings (even with the shipping) will more than make up for the cost.",1308960000,13,452,4.530864197530864
4286967,5,B0048QP8N6,"My friend from England introduced me to the Inbetweeners when I went to visit him a couple of months ago.  HYSTERICAL!  I'm sad the US is trying to adapt it for America because I just don't think the humour will transfer.  The seller was great!  One of the discs would skip an episode, so they sent me a new disc right away!  Great buying experience!",1298505600,3,350,4.323076923076923
4286968,5,B0048QP8N6,"The Inbetweeners is a hysterical series on secondary school life and the twists and turns of the character.  The  four main characters are well- developed and each have their own traits which are hilarious. Please note this series is not for children under age 15 or so as much of the language is crude.
This is truly a laugh out loud show which is typical of British comedy. We loved the box set and have watched it many times. The humour is still funny even when you have seen the episode more than once. I hope they will continue with this series.",1295481600,7,550,4.382352941176471

4286972,5,B0048QP8N6,"I saw the movie before i saw the series.  I LOVED BOTH!

These guys are HILARIOUS!  I was watching it on youtube.  Watching it wherever i could find it.  Download it.  Then I saw it for sale and I just HAD TO BUY IT!  Its hilarious and they are all perfect dorks with each other.

In this show.  The same jokes didn't translate well.  Its not like 'Shameless' where they stayed true to the way it is in the UK, while the remake stayed true to the US.  So they made lots of the jokes different.  The guys on this show...you know its a show.  Its a comedy first and foremost and you never forget that.  You will NEVER meet guys like this in real life.  They stick to what works.  Its a bit over the top in terms of sexuality and nudity for a television show but i guess the standards are different from the UK to US LOL.  Nudity.  We tend to take 'Realism' too far for comedies in America..mostly because some people actually believe it would be funny and do something they saw on television.

I would not let a teenage son or daughter watch this because of the language alone.  If that is not an issue to you, then certainly, ignore this review.",1430784000,3,340,4.524590163934426
4286977,4,B0048QP8N6,"This is easily the funniest show I have seen in a long time. The antics the characters get into reminds me of high school. I first discovered this show on Netflix and was instantly hooked from the first episode. This dvd collection is great but there is one problem. The music from the series is removed and replaced by other songs. This is the only downside of the dvd collection. In some cases it doesn't matter but during Neil's dance routine at the cavern club the choice of song matters. It was originally ""sexy back"" and this dvd replaces it with some weird country song. It must have been for licensing issues but it is still frustrating.",1427587200,3,645,4.521367521367521

4286986,5,B0048QP8N6,"This is a laugh out loud funny movie that provided a very entertaining and personal glimpse into the lives of several young gentleman and ladies who were coming of age. It was an interesting social look into blue collar British culture where parents are struggling to educate and control their children while at the same time trying to deal with their own personal lives. A fascinating look that makes the movie Animal House tame in comparison. My biggest problem with the movie is that I have picked up the British vulgar slang and am now referring to people as Wankers, Punters, and liberally use the term Bollocks whenever I disagree on something. Actually it is not that bad, but when these and other vulgar and common terms are used by the adolescents, they take on a hysterical meaning and definitely add to the humor of the series. You can't take these people seriously andone has to appreciate the series in its context. Somehow, I see a little deja Vu in the series as I reflect back on my own days at those same ages. Perhaps you will enjoy the same feeling as you watch this fascinating and entertaining series.",1405728000,2,1122,4.64321608040201
4286987,5,B0048QP8N6,"From ""Porky's"" to ""Superbad,"" the genre of Teen Sex Comedy has had many entries, ranging from bad to classic. ""The Inbetweeners"" obliterates them all with its perfection.

Just like the decades of comedies that have preceded this modern British masterpiece, this show deals with the same genre tropes to which all of these movies adhere: crude and stupid boys failing in their raunchy and humiliating hijinks during their pursuit of sex. And the show doesn't necessarily do any one thing so much better or different than the rest; it simply does everything so well.

The four boys are a splendid gang, each with their own distinct personalities and failings. The supporting cast of principal and parents are all great as well. Plus to an American, their filthy slang has an additional gleeful joy to hear their strange foreign words, akin to Guy Richie's old films like ""Snatch.""

Most importantly, the jokes are frequent and great. The humor ranges from offensively cruel verbal barbs, to goofy physical stunts, to sublimely absurd turns of circumstance. Perhaps the plotting is especially delightful, as every episode's shenanigans escalate in such a beautiful orgy of schadenfreude.

Not for the easily offended of course, but this show was made for all fans of outrageous and provocative humor.",1403481600,2,1298,5.137440758293839
4286988,5,B0048QP8N6,"I love this show. it's a british comedy so it can either be subtle or absurd. This one leans towards absurd.

Unfortunately netflix only has the first 2 seasons and i needed to see the third season... which ultimately lead to me writing this review. It has great humor and believe it or not it has a lot of heart as well. I do not regret this purchase at all. I'm confident you won't either. Good thing is you can sample two seasons of it before purchasing it. So if you buy it and regret it than you're kind of an idiot.... :/ haha,1391990400,,506,4.22680412371134

4287000,5,B0048QP8N6,"I have seen the first two series on Netflix and anxiously await the third (hence, I came to Amazon to see whether it's on Instant Streaming and could only find this.)  You're free to yell at me for reviewing a series I haven't seen completely, and a product I haven't ordered.

But I came to say this is getting compared to American Pie, and while I see the similarities, it must be said that this has more heart than you see this side of the Atlantic.  I definitely can't watch it with my young kids in the room, because even with the sometimes hard-to-decipher accents, it's clearly quite low-brow.

But you really care about these characters in lots of ways.  What is hilarious is I grew up a middle-class girl in Texas and my husband grew up in Philadelphia...and yet we both saw lots in these stories that reminded us of those awkward years.

If you were never the most popular in school and just loved to laugh, give this a try.  Like the show The IT Crowd, watch a couple of episodes before you decide.  I promise you'll find yourself wondering where Will, Si, Jay, and Neal end up.",1374278400,2,1089,4.41

4287008,3,B0048QP8N6,"Without knowing or really hearing anything about the Inbetweeners, I decided to go see the movie since it was playing at the local movie theater. I left the theater loving the movie (sadly, the theater was completely empty on Opening Night). I thought the movie was extremely well made and featured a good surprising soundtrack. Anyways, I decided to finally watch the show which was amazing! It was just as good as the movie, if not probably better.
Now about this set, I must say I'm happy to own the show, but the video quality is terrible, it very pixelly. It's disappointing that it looks this bad. I thought it looked poor on Netflix, but this is almost the same. The packaging is fairly simple, the case is made from cheap plastic as you feel like it's about to break in your hands, but other than that, it was worth how much I paid, $7 with free shipping so I feel like that's all it's pretty much worth since the picture quality is no Blu-Ray.",1356739200,,952,4.445714285714286

It bleeped out so much teenage language that the conversations were often difficult to follow.  Come on BBC America.  Do you think all Americans are prudes or were you so worried about offending your sponsors that you refused to release the actual British version preserving the funny language which is the way both British and American teens actually talk?

4287022,3,B0048QP8N6,"About 50% of us will identify with the trials and tribulations of teenage schoolboys - the desperate need to get lashed, the desperate need to look cool in front of your mates, the desperate need to avoid having the crap beaten out of you by the school bully, the desperate need to get into Emma Williamson's knickers (or at least a hand up her shirt) and so-on. In fact, school, for a boy of between about 15 and 18 is pretty desperate all 'round.

Jay, Simon, Neil and Will are four such boys, and the 18 episodes mined the comedy gold of their travails on E4 between 2008 and 2010. Now, before you go much further, do beware that this is probably aimed at the twentysomething/thirtysomething viewer and it is very much adult viewing: the language and sexual references take care of that, I can tell you. The four lads are fairly stock teens, a dim one, a ladies' man, a boaster and a geeky one and the format/theme is pretty much as per my opening paragraph.

The humour is bawdy and scatalogical, the language is shocking and the show won a number of awards. So does it work?

Well... sort of. The first series is great and I wouldn't hesitate to give it four or even five stars. There are a number of scenes that had me literally crying with laughter, the humour is nicely sustained  throughout and there's a fairly decent nostalgia schtick (even for a guy who went through sixth form some 30 years back). The characters are fresh and straight out of Grange Hill and the acting (the lads are all played by young adult actors) is good. Admittedly the characters are all parodies, but that of course is the best way to look back at your youth. I particularly enjoyed the teacher Mr Gilbert (one of only two teachers with speaking parts) who is dripping sarcasm and child-hatred personified. I never had a teacher like him, but I can IMAGINE having had one. Indeed, if I ever went into the profession, Mr Gilbert is the man I would model myself on.

The problem comes in the two subsequent series when it becomes clear that the idea had a pretty short shelf-life. Instead of exploring new and developing scenarios, laying down fresh ideas and introducing new characters, the writers clearly got lazy and decided that, because S1 worked, S2 and S3 should be more of the same but writ larger. Thus, the characters are the same but more so: the boasty one is boastier, the nerdy one is nerdier, the dimmer one is virtually brain-damaged and the lady's man is (and pardon me for this) more completely c**t-struck than ever. The toilet humour is wetter, the drunken behaviour is more inebriated and the ridiculous scrapes are more contrived. That would be fine if the actual humour of the first series had been at least sustained but it is not. Over the subsequent two series it becomes progressively rarified to the point that the last few episodes are toe curlingly unfunny and the humour is akin to spray-painting ""F##k the Pope!"" on a church wall. I say ""progressively"" - S2 is better than S3 but not as good as S1 and there are certainly SOME good laughs to be had, but that doesn't add up to a good enough reason to fork out for all three.

So, sadly, after watching them on my MacBook a few times, I had to place the DVD's in a closet since I ran out of options regarding choosing a particular region for viewing.

So, here we are in 2012, and the boys have finally jumped the pond. Wonderful.  They're on iTunes as well but you can only get seasons 2 and 3 via that service.  I understand the movie will be out on DVD in the US later this year, still another reason to live just a little bit longer! :-)

The boy's friendship is evident in each very well-written episode and the situations hilarious. Their experiences and motivations tend to focus on girls and the related angst is typical for their age group  For American viewers, think Animal House meets the Big Bang Theory, but with more cursing and British accents.",1343001600,8,971,4.361111111111111
4287024,5,B0048QP8N6,HAHAHAHA! I absolutely LOVE this show! Too bad it ended after the third series. I have the UK discs and will be ordering this set as well!,1342569600,2,138,4.148148148148148
4287025,5,B0048QP8N6,"My fellow Amazon reviewer - K. Harris - has already posted a very detailed review of this DVD so I won't repeat much of what he has written (all of which I agree with) but, rather, add some more info that I think you will find helpful.

""The inbetweeners"" ran on the commercial Channel Four network in the UK from 2008-2010 and, as K mentions - British TV series are only usually six or seven episodes per season. So this DVD package from eONE contains all three seasons.

The series follows four boys in a ""comprehensive school"" in the UK. (Wikipedia defines ""comprehensive school"" as a state run school similar to high schools in the US. The four main characters are obviously ""under 18"" (as many lines in the script refer to that) but we're not sure what grade they are in since they seem about 17 in the first season and continue in class as the seasons progress.

One thing to say for these guys is that their hormones are working overtime. They want to ""have at it"" with not only the young ""birds"" in school but - ready for this? - with their friends mothers. (If this fact shocks you, then this is probably not a series you will want to watch - honestly - but it's all done with a sense of raunchy humor. I found that a lot of the language and situations in the short 25-minute episodes - reminded me of the ""American Pie"" series of movies. And I at times it went even further. This may have been a TV series but it probably exceeds most US cable shows in the number of times the F-word and similar expletives are used. And there is nudity but most often bare male buttocks. And the ""toilet humor"" is not just a style of humor, but a lot of scenes seem to occur in a toilet. And there is virtually a ""bodily function"" joke at least once in every episode. Again, I'm just pointing this out for those who may not know what they are getting into.

At the same time I was watching this DVD, I've been catching up on the US TV series (on broadcast TV) ""The Big Bang Theory"". Like ""The Inbetweeners"" it revolves around four friends (this time they are post college geniuses) and their attempts to meet women (including the ""hottie"" across the hall. Each of the four is distinct and in a few cases they parallel the four guys in ""The Inbetweeners"".

This series seems to have a cult following and I must say that, once I knew what to expect, I had a lot of fun watching the series. It's definitely over the top but most guys can relate to similar experiences. (well some, anyway).

The eOne set is LOADED with bonuses, though they are probably for the true fan more than the casual viewer. Each of the three discs has a separate ""making of"" or ""behind the scenes"" featurette, plus a ""video diary"" created by the cast. There are deleted scenes and outtakes (these last items under a minute each) and more.

So, check your inhibitions as to language and check out the guys in this DVD. It really is a lot of fun.

By the way, the series was followed by a ""feature film"" about the quartet's post school years, which as not yet been released on DVD in the US. Since the ""trailer"" is the first thing you see on this set, and the DVD has an insert saying the film will be ""in Theaters September 2012"", I guessing that eOne will release it on DVD by the end of the year.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4287026,5,B0048QP8N6,Spectacularly fun series relating the life of 4 young British males. While somewhat crude at times it is not for the faint-hearted. There is a lot of swearing which is a turn-off but it really is all there is to know about being young male and maladjusted. This is some of the best comedy I have seen in a while.,1332979200,,312,4.216666666666667

8418773,5,B0048QP8N6,"I read the reviews on The Inbetweeners and thought I'd give it a chance, SO happy I did!! This series is hilarious and had me google searching British slang which I now use on a daily basis. The first episode didn't grab me right off the bat like The Increasinly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret (you must watch that series!!!) but after the second episode I was hooked! I can't wait to watch the movie!",1455148800,,402,4.373333333333333
8418774,5,B0048QP8N6,"OH good LORD how can I possibly describe the genius that is The Inbetweeners?! This show is, hands down, the funniest thing I've ever seen. Ever. It has amazing writing, obviously. And then you add Blake Harrison, Simon Bird, Joe Thomas, and James Buckley and IT. IS. PERFECTION. We have watched each episode at least 3 times and laugh pretty much every couple of seconds. I'm not kidding. It's not something you watch with the kids, so be aware of that. But adults deserve a few minutes of hilarity without poor animation or songs about manners. So, take back your adulthood and watch this show. If you don't like it, you can personally message me (I don't even know if this is possible, it's just how committed I am to my opinion) and I'll happily refund your money (again, probably won't, but...). To really drive this point into the ground: If you don't like The Inbetweeners, YOU are the problem, This show freaking rocks.",1454630400,,927,4.658536585365853
8418775,5,B0048QP8N6,"This series is excellent , I have already watched it 3 times and never get tired of it, one of the best if not the best comedy series I have ever watched.",1453075200,,154,3.84375
