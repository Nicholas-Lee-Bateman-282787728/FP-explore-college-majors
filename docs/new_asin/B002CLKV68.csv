3906331,5,B002CLKV68,"I love The Game so much i DVR every Episode that comes on BET or CW. Derwin Davis and Girl Melanie is a great couple and Derwin is so cute. The Game has become so addicting to me i cant stop watching it and loved that it is on DVD. Jason Pitts is so funny with his cheap self and Kelly Pitts right along with him. Tasha Mack now she is crazy with her ghetto pow pow pow self. Cant forget about Malik Wright 40 million dollar kid, gotta love him and Tee Tee crazy behind and all the drama and comedy that follws i do love this show and cant wait til season 2 and 3 come out on DVD and PRAY for BET to pick up and give us season 4, 5, ect. Yeah so buy the DVD yes u will b hooked, and no you won't regret it!!!",1252627200,,708,3.6953642384105962
3906332,5,B002CLKV68,"this show is a really good show. i love how they depict a young woman who is in school dating a pro athelete. and in the process gets caught up in all the drama. i watch this show everytime it comes on. even tha reruns. im gonna get this dvd soon and i hope it don't be long before they bring out season 2 and 3. im also a big fan of girlfriends 2. didn't know the game is just a spin off of girlfriends because i never seen that episode of joan introducing her cousin melanie. but trust, you won't be disappointed in this great tv series.",1252195200,,539,4.0
3906333,5,B002CLKV68,"This was a super show. I must admit, I preferred Girlfriends just a bit more, but this was excellent adult TV fare. The cast was perfect; the production values were slick. The stories could be fun and silly, but never dumbed down. Who can ever forget Malik and Girl Melanie's late night ""girl talk"" session. Or Tasha Mack and Kelly's initial attempts at friendship (""I heard your daughter screaming and just wanted to see if it was a Penny in Good Times situation...). Rick Fox and Robin Givens playing themselves was genius! An then, of course, there is Tee Tee! Mara Brock Akil, who created both Girlfriends and The Game, rules. And Kelsey Grammer deserves credit for seeing the genius of her creations and producing both shows.",1252108800,3,730,4.755905511811024
3906334,5,B002CLKV68,"I love this show! All of the characters were worthy to watch, even Robin Givens! There were some scenes that could be predictable, but always with a slight twist of the pen. This show was like riding a ""roller-coaster"", you just knew it was going to be a great ride, and hated the ride to end!",1251417600,,293,4.25
3906335,5,B002CLKV68,"I really love this show. The comedy and setting is so great. I love Derwin and ""Med School"". I also love Tasha Mack cause she keep it real and speaks what's on her mind.

3906337,5,B002CLKV68,"I love this show! I'm a huge fan. I love the story line, excellent writers, captivating acting! I'm glad they show it on BET, however, myself and ALL of my peers would love to see new episodes!  We all agree that we relate to the characters because they are in our age group and experience what we experience; similar to what the show ""Soul Food"" did for my colleagues who are a little bit more ""mature"" than myself. Does anyone one know how we can get this show back on the air?! Who do we need to beg?! I'm so happy that the DVD is FINALLY going to be available for us to purchase!  I can honestly say that I KNOW for a FACT that this DVD set is going to make huge sales!  After watching just 1 episode, I was hooked (not in a bad way)!  Please bring our show back, Ladies night is not the same without it!  Our boyfriends and husbands even watch it.  It's so much I have to say about this show because it's truly a favorite of mine and all of my friends.",1247616000,14,957,4.037037037037037

3906339,5,B002CLKV68,This show is great. I love Melanie and Derwin. The drama and realism is great. I am so sad they took it off the air. I would consider getting HBO or Showtime if they showed it. They need to put this show back on air it gave a lot of young actors a chance as well as it was one of the few diverse shows on television!!!,1246406400,10,318,3.7611940298507465

I recently got season 1 on DVD and all I can say is I LOVE THIS SHOW and that I should've watched more of it when it first aired. I think it's a great show filled with laughs, good times, and tears.

3906402,4,B002CLKV68,"The Game is a unique show: it is not really comedy but it does have its moments. It is really quite dramatic and seems like a soap opera sometimes in the twists and turns and not quite happy or resolved endings. Those plotlines are taken up later, in shows down the line and may not go the way you think. I will keep watching.",1378339200,,326,4.109375

3906417,4,B002CLKV68,"The only complaint I had is that they took all of the original songs off.  I loved Heather Headley's ""In My Mind"" and Jordin Sparks' ""No Air"".

3906419,5,B002CLKV68,"Thank goodness this set reached me before the crippling snowstorms in the Northeast did!!

I didn't watch this show regularly when it aired and since I miss more re-runs than I watch, I decided to buy the set.  This season is a hilarious representation of the lives of professional football players & has become my entertainment crack!

I got sucked into the lives of wide-eyed rookie receiver, Derwin Davis & his ""Girl"" Melanie Barnett as they struggle to fit in with fellow players, players' wives/girlfriends, image consultants & agents while fighting to maintain their relationship & down-to-earth values.  The ups & downs of their relationship are balanced out by the lives & problems of 2 of his teammates:

Jason & Kelly Pitts - married for 7 years, Jason is fearful about the impending end of his football career & having never won the championship while Kelly battles her feelings of resentment towards Jason for his controlling behavior; and

Malik Wright & Tasha Mack - star QB & his ""Momager"".  Malik at 25 yrs is living it up as ""The $40-million Kid"" but wonders if it's time to cut the apron strings while Tasha fights to prove herself in the business world as more than just the lucky woman who gave birth to a star athlete.

I completely enjoyed my marathon viewing of the first season of this show while trapped inside by the snow and recommend that those who enjoyed the series, GIRLFRIENDS give it a chance.",1268006400,,1426,4.744939271255061
