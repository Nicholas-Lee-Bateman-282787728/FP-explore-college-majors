1419471,4,B00005AX8A,"In Space Man, we're treated to a genuine, low bugdet, sci-fi, gangster, kung-fu, comedy, love story. I saw this as a refreshing break from the hi-tech, mega bugdet, CGI bloated features we've been seeing.  It's the story of a man who was kidnapped as a young boy by space aliens and returns back to earth 25 years later.  During his time away from earth, he has been trained and conditioned to be the ultimate hunter/fighter/killer and now has to try and assimilate back into earth culture.  I thought this movie was pretty funny, and for it's budgetary limitations, it had some pretty good fight scenes and effects.  While the movie was made for around $50,000, it looks like the director got the most out of it he could.  I would be interested in seeing what he could do with a larger budget.  It's nice to know that movies like this can still be made.  If you liked this, I would also recommend Dark Star.",1052697600,,908,4.5
1419472,4,B00005AX8A,"Watching this movie feels like you're goofing around and playing with a bunch of your friends.  It doesn't try too hard to hide that the lead pipes they're hitting eachother with are cardboard. It lets you in on it, it feels like any one of the actors at some point are going to look at you and say, ""What do you want to play now?"".  At one point a car drives past the guy he's supposed to pick up and inside the driver says, ""Oh, I screwd that one up."".  On the commentary track Scott Dikkers says how that was the actor's natural reaction to accidently missing his mark but Dikkers just left it in.
  Scott Dikkers is such a genius.  I wish everybody could see the stuff he's done.  His cartoon Jim's Journal is so beautiful, his short films give a better idea of what he can do with more money, The Onion, and this other book ""You Are Worthless"" which I wrote another review of here. It's so easy to love him for the work he's let us seen.",1041033600,,942,4.171270718232044

1419474,4,B00005AX8A,"It's ironic for someone reviewing movies on the Internet to have such a predilection for low-tech films.
Much of the charm of Scott Dikkers' B-movie comedy SPACEMAN is its nostalgia for the days when sci-fi was made on the cheap. When I was a kid watching Buster Crabbe as Flash Gordon on Saturday morning TV, it didn't bother me that his rocket was powered by a 4th of July sparkler!
SPACEMAN'S writer/director Scott Dikkers created THE ONION, which proclaims itself America's Finest News Source. With branches in several major cities, it's the largest circulation humor publication in the country. The paper's satirical take on the major and minuscule events of the day is certainly more frank than your average daily rag.
One of the driving forces behind THE ONION'S success was Scott's uncanny media savvy. In additon to editing the newspaper, he has created radio, TV, the Web, and edited a couple of best selling books.
SPACEMAN is the tale of a young boy who is abducted by aliens only to crash land on earth twenty-five years later with powers pretty far beyond those of mortal men. Spaceman's (David Ghilardi) commanders have inserted an electrode in his brain that stimulates his taste for violence and obedience. On this planet, however, he finds little demand for his work experience as a ceremonial combatant. Given the way TV is trending he's slightly ahead of his time.
He makes a reliable but intense grocery clerk until a series of culture clashes lead him to an inevitable brush with the law and commitment to a hospital for psychiatric treatment. When a fellow patient mentions that he'd rather hire a hitman for himself than go through another drinking binge, Spaceman stumbles upon a line of work for which he's suited.
Along the way, he meets a young woman (Deborah King) who is turned on by the fact that he kills people, is stalked by a pair of X-File government agents who LOVE to dissect aliens, and seeks employment with a sorry excuse for a Chicago mob based in a rundown barber shop.
It's all a pleasant departure from Hollywood's current love affair with gross out comedies. The commentary track by director Scott Dikkers (who claims to have gone insane during this Quixotic no-budget enterprise) is a shot by shot lesson in why you shouldn't try this at home!
For all of its budgetary constraints (two of the actors were homeless men, one of whom had to be reached through his parole officer) it is sharply written and performed and boasts an unexpected original symphonic score (by Edward Pearsall).",995587200,2,2531,4.84757505773672
1419475,5,B00005AX8A,"In all honesty, I worked on this film in two capacities: as an actor and as the recordist/producer/mixing engineer for the orchestral soundtrack. Because of this, I offer a review which is not entirely objective. Having said that, I was thrilled to be involved with this film because Scott Dikkers--the director and former comic genius behind The Onion--is simply one of the most comedically talented people I've ever come into contact with. This movie is the result of an arduous journey to a man's dream, and I am honored to have been able to take part in it.
Scotty, as we his friends call him, adores the big action movie. If one could make the comedy equivalent of ""Terminator II"" for a pathetic $50,000, he would be the one to do it. ""Spaceman"", of course, is not ""Terminator II"", and we were unfortunately assigned the daunting task of completing it for $50k. But what we ended up with was so much more than the sum of it's Radio Shack parts. It has action, it has romance, and by golly it is funny as well. And between Scott's vision in the filmmaking process, and Ed Pearsall's in the amazing scoring of the orchestral parts, we ended up with a film that will indeed entertain you. Give Spaceman a shot; I believe you'll enjoy it immensely, just as we did making it.",990316800,4,1275,4.547826086956522
7936109,3,B00005AX8A,"It is really hard to judge something of this type/caliber.  Knowing the budget was low, the actors and directors were newbies and the time of filming was low tech... I can appreciate its rawness.  The story line is technically just fine especially considering the budget.  The ending was decent enough and one crazy comment was concerning the ninja guy actually had skills not seen in modern high tech movies (considering his moves weren't edited!!).  Grand scheme of things this was a crappy movie, but going in knowing it was totally Mistery Science Theater 3000 at best it was just fine.  Full disclosure of my actual purchase was simply because one of my former high school theater friends performed here in his first movie.  (His part was minuscule but fun seeing a familiar face)",1512432000,,785,4.864661654135339

7936111,3,B00005AX8A,"Better than I thought it might be (I meant to buy Rocket Man). The Spaceman guy is irritating,, but gets better. The fart thing went on a little too long, but was actually worth watching, by the time I got to the end",1482624000,,216,4.046511627906977
7936112,4,B00005AX8A,"This movie was made with almost no budget (I think it was $50,000 total). It is one of those movies you'll either ""get"" and like or be bored with. I ""get"" the movie and like it very much.

This is a comedy with some action -- mostly satire with humorous plays on various sci-fi and action movie cliches. The actors play everything straight, so the lines are delivered as if this were serious dialog.

The move explores the theme of what would happen if a young boy was abducted by space aliens, who reprogrammed his brain so he would be a ""ritual combatant"" / gladiator for their sports, who then crash lands back to Earth and has to try to survive in a world he doesn't understand.

Since the movie had no budget to speak of, there is very little in the way of special effects and there isn't much background music.

If you are a fan of Indie films and experimental movies, then this is definitely one you should see. If your tastes are primarily high-budget, mainstream movies you might not care for this.",1402790400,,1007,4.427027027027027
7936113,5,B00005AX8A,"Its low budget and a sci-fi.  If you can understand that, you should love it too.  A child gets abducted, trained to be a worrior, then crash lands back on Earth.  For me, it's a great movie to get lost in.  And hey, it could happen.",1330473600,,233,4.0
7936114,5,B00005AX8A,"Low budget but incredibly fun to watch.  Thoughtful Sci-Fi mixed with intense action and uplifting romantic comedy all culminating with one of the greatest pipe fighting scenes ever filmed.  This movie is not to be missed!  No joke.  This movie really is fun to watch and that's why we watch movies, right?",1195689600,,306,4.826923076923077
7936115,4,B00005AX8A,"Trying to convince you (those who choose to read this) that this campy movie is worth every minute of your time will be my toughest job here, as I'm going to say some things that will seem at odds with each other when referring to this film. But I'm going to give it a go anyway and hope that you bear with me for a few moments...

If you watched the TV series Batman (starring Adam West) and thought the BAM! BOOF! and CRASH! pop-ups were cool whenever he and Robin got into fights with the Riddler, the Joker or some other dastardly villain, or if you didn't mind the fact that the early rocket propulsion system of Flash Gordon was accomplished by a fourth of July sparkler, you're the right person to watch SPACEMAN. I'm not saying you need to be a simpleton in order to watch this! Quite the contrary, you just have to be the type of person who's not overly-critical of such things.

SPACEMAN is ...I'm not sure how to put this without sounding ridiculous ...um ...it's the best B-movie, low-budget, science fiction, romance, kung fu/gangster film I've ever seen.

I stumbled upon SPACEMAN when nothing else was on TV. I was looking for something different, something refreshingly out-of-the-ordinary, but I had no idea what I'd clicked onto when I found SPACEMAN. At first glance, I was ready to turn it off. The production value was obviously very low. The filming was grainy or overexposed in places and the costumes were immediately laughable. But I decided to give the story a try. I'm very glad I did.

It's the story that pulls you through and makes this film a definitive triumph. The script is sheer genius and the acting is good.

Spaceman (David Ghilardi) starts out as a four-year-old child who is abducted from his front yard by aliens. Twenty-five years later, Spaceman crash lands back on Earth and finds himself unprepared for a world he barely remembers. His brain has been altered, and he is trained for combat and submission to a ""commander"". Any commander will do, really. So, in order to make himself feel more comfortable, he finds a job so that he has a commander (a boss). His first job is as a stock boy at a supermarket. But problems quickly arise as Spaceman has to improvise when his commander (boss) isn't around. When he witnesses a shoplifting, he takes matters into his own deadly hands and injures the thief, thus getting himself fired. Spaceman tries other locations for possible employment, including the military, the FBI, and the Mob, but none will have him.

During all of this, there's a love story building between Spaceman and a pretty apartment neighbor named Sue (Deborah King). She's drawn to his physical nature ...even though Spaceman can't procreate without orders from his commander.

Back to the FBI and the Mob ...

The FBI find out about Spaceman and try to capture him and his family and friends, only to find that Spaceman is no one to mess around with. His deadly demeanor ends any conflicts he encounters. Trying for a job as a hit man, Spaceman is even rebuffed by the Mob ...for a while. Sound interesting? It really is.

Give SPACEMAN a try. And trust me, you're going to want to turn it off after the first fifteen minutes. Don't! Watch closely, enjoy the story and be thankful that this campy film isn't trying to be some big blockbuster movie on half a shoestring budget. It never tries to do that. It pays homage to a time when rocket ships didn't have blue screens with CGI and had to tell a story about people; those funny, threatening, flawed, and ridiculous people!",1152835200,4,3536,4.635782747603834
7936116,3,B00005AX8A,"The production values are not high. The budget obviously wasn't, either. But for pure ""campiness"" and humor, Spaceman is fun to watch. It probably doesn't belong in everyone's video library, but would be worth renting, if you're into Sci-Fi.",1140739200,,241,5.205128205128205
7936117,5,B00005AX8A,"The result isn't all that bad, but it did drive the director insane.  In his commentary track, he tells all and it's interesting.  The film itself suffers from not having the biggest budget, or professional actors, but it still succeeds, just not on a professional level.  It's entertaining in a laid back way and quite impressive given the humble origins.  This is head and shoulders above other no budget efforts I've seen, not including clerks.  Interesting though.  Gotta go",1112313600,,478,4.987341772151899
7936118,5,B00005AX8A,"Eugine the Spaceman is the ultimate killing machine, and he is a pretty good cashier too. This movie is about a lost warrior from outerspace that has to fight off the FBI, a group of hitmen, learn to think for himself, and serch for his true identity. I found this movie to be both action-packed and hilarious. I loved the parts where Spaceman riped out a mans vocal cords and threw a couple of forks into another guys eyeballs. Also I loved the pipe fight and kung-fu fight between Spaceman and the Japanese guy. Spaceman will never quit killing!!!",1059696000,4,549,4.555555555555555
