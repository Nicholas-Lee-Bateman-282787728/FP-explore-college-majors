8137984,5,B000HBL4KC,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who gave this video 2 stars. At first glance, I thought it was because he disagreed with Taubes. Then I realized he supported Taubes and disagreed with everyone else. Either way, I don't think such a rating was warranted. It shows a lack of understanding of healthy, informed discussion. We're right and you're wrong. Period. That's how we got into this mess in the first place. Dissenting views were ridiculed and silenced while the rates of obesity, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes steadily climbed as we followed conventional nutritional advice for 3 decades. All the while cigarette smoking, the number one cause of preventable disease, has been decreasing. Clearly something's gone wrong. It's time to re-examine our assumptions with an open mind.

I happen to agree with Taube's viewpoint, but feel the other 3 participants make good points as well. You can see, however, that each of them approaches the discussion with their own bias, Taubes included. As shown by her head-shaking whenever he speaks, Barbara Howard has no intention of reviewing the studies from the 1950s referenced by Taubes. That's a shame, as we can tell Taubes has examined the studies supporting her case for reduced fat and increased exercise quite thoroughly. In the end, however, the burden of proof is on him. She merely has to rest on 30 years of conventional wisdom.

Dr. Oz does a great job mediating the discussion, acknowledging the value of Taubes' work for the field of nutrition and medicine even though he disagrees with his conclusions. How refreshing. Dr. Ornish also impressed me with his thoughtful, well-reasoned arguments. He opened the discussion by reviewing common ground to give the viewer some not to be missed take home points, like avoid refined sugars and processed foods. He also speaks of his willingness to concede discoveries such as fish oil when the evidence clearly shows their benefit. Will he and others eventually examine the evidence supporting low-carb high fat diets? I hope so. But in the meantime there's nothing stopping us from taking a look ourselves.",1300665600,3,2118,5.065902578796561
8137985,2,B000HBL4KC,"I saw this when Taubes book first came out and I have to say I've lost alot of respect for Dean Ornish, and Dr. Oz. Barbara Howard was bizarre "" ketogenic diets make people retarded...!!!"" The only good was that it did show people who Gary Taubes was. There was no serious discussion of diet and health that I could tell.",1197676800,4,321,4.278688524590164
