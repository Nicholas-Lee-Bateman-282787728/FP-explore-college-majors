8344151,3,B001UL9RSE,"Heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire loves a young girl more than he loves his country and his royal obligations. The romance is troubled. Very colorful. Great cinematography. Lots of royal glitz. Dancing. Slow movingvery slow moving. I had a hard time getting into this film. Great love story based on fact, but it didn't move me. No emotional appeal. Deneuve and Sharif both seem bored and have low energy rather than grand passion. This movie is watchable, but there are so many better movies.",1470182400,,509,4.862068965517241
