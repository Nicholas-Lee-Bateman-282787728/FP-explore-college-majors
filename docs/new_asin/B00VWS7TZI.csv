8711458,4,B00VWS7TZI,"NH10 is about the changing face of India amidst urban sprawl and ambitious successful people there is still an ancient world that is crude and jarring. Sometimes they clash.
As the skylines of a fast growing town dissipate they encounter a world that does not care about progress or development but only the preservation of norms and values of a prehistoric society. NH10 is about the naivete and ignorance of the upper crust and the educated who feel that modernity will solve many societal problems. It is a collision with a universe that you only read about in the newspapers.
NH10 is a fast paced thriller that is good and has many moments of shock.  Meera (Anushka Sharma) and Arjun (Neil Bhoopalam) are ambitious and successful professionals who we often see coming out of fancy restaurants and in enviable jobs. They live at the right addresses and wear the most beautiful clothes.  However the also are arrogantly unaware of the structural divisions that exist in society.
The lady Meera is attacked by goons right at the beginning of the movie when she tries to leave a party late at night. The accident is shrugged off by the cops. The director clearly tries to express the vast differences of  society in India in many such scenes.
Arjun and Meera head out of the city for a vacation that was long overdue and you know that this is not going to be a honeymoon. Taking many elements of a doomed road trip from horror movies, the director applies them to the road trip. He also displays the many problems that the economic development in India has created.
Our couple are unwillingly dragged into a violent honor killing fight. Obviously things get hopeless and shocking.
Anushka is superb as a urban dweller who is so out of sorts in the brutish world that she is forced to confront and fight for her survival. She gets additional congratulations because she produced the film herself.
It raises many disturbing questions about India and its society as it grapples with unrestricted economic development and the nature of evil is it man or woman or both equally.

8711459,4,B00VWS7TZI,"It felt real, an almost visceral involvement in these people's lives. I experienced it as if a layer of movie BS had been peeled away to reveal the part you aren't supposed to see. There was no glamor or special effects. Our weaknesses and strengths were laid bare and Anushka Sharma carried the show. Not just another beautiful woman, she made me believe it was happening. I gave it only 4/5 because there was no English voice over option. There is no excuse for avoiding the English speaking market given the overall quality of the HIndi film industry products. Close captioning is like a bad comedy. Not sure if the people who translate even speak both languages, much less care if the captions work.",1439856000,5,703,4.67741935483871

8711461,4,B00VWS7TZI,"Nine out of ten Hindi (Bollywood) films are comparable to junk bonds in quality of script, acting, directing and willingness to spend money on production. Admittedly oriented toward a less educated audience (comparable to American tele watchers) in providing life's fantasy escapism.
This film breaks the mode, admittedly there was some dumb decision making, but overall an action thriller in which the female shows some gutsy fortitude.
And, surprise, there are two more Hindi films I've seen this past month that are similarly scripted as intelligent thrillers: ""Badlapur"", ""Ugly"".
These exhaust Bolly's quality quota for the month.",1434585600,3,634,5.546391752577319
