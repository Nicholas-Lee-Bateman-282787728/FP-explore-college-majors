7684911,5,B01CK6C4M8,"With this DVD exercising feels like you are on vacation. You can see the nature such as Lake Como, but you also get to know the city life of Italy. I particularly liked that you can hear the real sounds of the cities with their street musicians. The DVD shows scenes during the day in the sunshine until the evening, so you can admire the city lights. Even the walk through Milan, especially through the beautiful Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, I like very much.",1462752000,3,462,4.511904761904762
7684912,5,B01CK6C4M8,"I really enjoy this DVD. I have never been to Rome and this DVD gives me the possibility to see all the beautiful places of the city. It feels very realistic to walk through this beautiful city on a sunny day. I use my treadmill for this workout and the pace of the filming is just right for that. On your walk, you can see Roman sculptures, fountains, the typical street life with street performers and many other beautiful things. You can also hear the crowds talking, music in the background which is played in the city and you can also hear the sounds of cars which are driving next to you. I can only recommend this DVD if you want to explore this magnificent city.",1460678400,3,670,4.325396825396825
7684913,5,B01CK6C4M8,Enchanting footage of Rome in brilliant full color with realistic sound.  It is as if you were actual strolling the streets enjoying a vacation in Rome.  There are three different walks from which to choose.  You can see all the beauty of Rome without leaving your home.  Especially enjoyed the scenes of Rome at night.  High quality filming with no shaking camera.  Automatically loops for continuous workout.  Great for tread mill or stationary cycle workout.,1460332800,,461,5.066666666666666
7684914,5,B01CK6C4M8,"I love Italy and this DVD takes me there making my exercise experience much more enjoyable.  There are at least two cities Milan and Florence featured on this DVD.  There is also the beautiful Lake Como in the majestic backdrop of the snow covered Alps.  This DVD is professionally filmed without interruption or annoying shaking as in some nature videos.  The sound track is realistic and gives one the feeling of actually walking amongst the ancient wonders of Italy including Michelangelo's statue of David, a true artist treasure.  I especially enjoy the bright colorful videography and the variety included in the three walks on this DVD.  The street performers are most interesting.  There is even a piano player playing on one of the streets.  Italy at its finest all in one video.",1460332800,7,788,4.916666666666667
8753364,3,B01CK6C4M8,"Not my favorite. I suppose if you already knew Rome it might  be OK but I have never been there and I had no idea where we were. A simple note on the screen would have helped. Also LOTS and LOTS of people everywhere. Left me feeling Rome is coming off my ""bucket list"". There were so many people it was difficult to see the ""sights"". I have another walking tape on Rome and it was much less busy.",1529625600,,396,4.012658227848101
8753365,5,B01CK6C4M8,"Interesting, beautiful scenery. I enjoyed the views. I like that the experience was what I would expect to encounter while riding a bike. As in other DVDs, the bike does get close to some people. If I ever go back to Italy, I want to check out Rome.",1522540800,,249,4.208333333333333
8753366,2,B01CK6C4M8,Descriptions of what you were seeing would have made this so much better...too much of the same thing.,1506556800,,102,4.722222222222222
8753367,3,B01CK6C4M8,"Better for treadmill walking than stationary bike riding. The locales are lovely, but the ""walks"" are short -- I know because I've been in Milano and this pretty much covers a four square block area (if that). I think if I were preparing for a trip to any of these places, these would be helpful.",1494633600,,296,4.4
8753368,1,B01CK6C4M8,IT IS VERY SLOW IT WOULD BE ALOT BETTER IF IT ACTUALLY WENT ALONG WITH WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT THE TIME,1494028800,,102,3.6818181818181817

8753373,4,B01CK6C4M8,"I especially loved Florence. When we were there, we got lost in the city, but walking thru Florence on this video, I have not gotten lost once. Kidding aside, it brings back wonderful memories, and before you know it, you are finished exercising",1471737600,8,245,4.72093023255814
