8153796,4,B000K15WL6,You'll get excellent nuggets on how these designers think.  I enjoyed the dvd quite a bit for that fact.  But it was disconcerting how short the segments were.  Just as you were getting into what the designer was conveying the segment would end.  That is a disappointment after the engrossing nature of Helvetica's designer shorts (the extras),1203724800,,343,4.964912280701754
8153797,4,B000K15WL6,"A great look at some of the most talented and inspirational graphic designers of our time. Some nice insights into the process, thinking, constaints of certain projects. The short run time (just under an hour) is a bit of a mixed blessing. While the pace is quick and engaging, it might have been nice had the DVD gone into a bit more detail in some aspects. All in all, very enjoyable.",1181174400,2,386,4.450704225352113
8153798,5,B000K15WL6,"For those of us who live and breathe graphic design, this is a great DVD about 6 famous graphic designers who have inspired us, shocked us and showed us what it is all about. A great resource for the design educator.",1174348800,2,216,4.2926829268292686
