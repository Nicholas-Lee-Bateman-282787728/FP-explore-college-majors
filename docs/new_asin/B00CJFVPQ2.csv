8582515,4,B00CJFVPQ2,Amazon offered the series by season and I picked and chose the topics I wanted to see most that way. I loved it when it came out in the 1970's and wanted to enjoy it all over again.,1430870400,,181,3.789473684210526

8582518,5,B00CJFVPQ2,"Great old series that brings back a lot of 70's stuff while at the same time, strangely enough, offering theories that are still in play today, thirty years later.

Some of the segments are downright hokey but fewer than you would think. I grew up in the 70's and it was definetly a time of fads and far fetched theories about things...very farfetched in some cases. But from what I've seen of this show so far, and I've only bought two seasons so far, it's not that silly. And even the ones that are, it's fun to watch anyway. And a bit bittersweet to watch Leonard Nimoy host.

If you recall this series from your childhood by all means get it, you won't be disappointed. It's stood up pretty well. If you've never seen it before but believe in things that go bump in the night and far out theories about everything and anything under the sun then you'll probably still enjoy it. Just don't take it too seriously and it'll be fun.",1427673600,,932,4.381502890173411

8582520,5,B00CJFVPQ2,Great 70s show would not be as good without Nimoy. Early precursor to Monster Quest. It has held up well.,1399507200,,105,4.3
8582521,5,B00CJFVPQ2,I ordered this for my husband because he used to watch this show years ago when it was still shown on TV.  He was so happy to get it.  Interesting and fun to watch!,1398556800,,164,3.7941176470588234
