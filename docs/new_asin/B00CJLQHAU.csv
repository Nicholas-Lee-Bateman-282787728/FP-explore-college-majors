5724495,5,B00CJLQHAU,"First of all, the actors look gorgeous on screen! The love scenes are realistic and tender! The message at the end is powerful because it is a testament to the human spirit as Jason London's character overcomes all struggles!  It begins as a 'guys' movie, but can be enjoyed by anyone!",1386115200,,285,4.588235294117647
5724496,5,B00CJLQHAU,"This was a great modern day film noir.  Though it was low-budget I liked everything about it.  The writing, directing, acting and cinematography was outstanding.  And the music score really fit the seedy industrial environment that was the film's backdrop, especially the closed down factory where the climax took place.  As Mitch, Jason London gave a heartfelt performance as the common man caught up in events way over his head.  Yes, he made some bad decisions when he chose to not just walk away from Amy played by beautiful and talented Danielle Harris, but he was infatuated and couldn't help himself.  At times, the film was edge-of-the-seat suspenseful, in particular during a scene that takes place where Mitch is hiding in Amy's house trying to gather evidence that will exonerate him of a crime he didn't commit. And the film abounds with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end.  This is definitely one you want to check out.",1386115200,4,961,4.858895705521473
5724497,1,B00CJLQHAU,"It's a story nearly as old as film itself--guy falls for a sexy woman out of his league.  It turns out she has a husband she wants to get rid of.  The guy finds himself a fall guy.  Fatal Call tries to recycle familiar film noir tropes but fails on every possible level.  The plot twists are extremely predictable. The cast is generally bland and forgettable except for Danielle Harris, who is badly miscast and probably gives the worst performance of her career.  The film lacks any sense of style at all and looks bright and ugly, like a cheap 1970's made-for-TV movie.  If you had no talent whatsoever but had the money and ego to think you could be the next Cohen Brothers Fatal Call is very likely the movie you would end up making--it's witless, suspense-free and boring.  Not recommended under any circumstances.",1375488000,,819,4.606896551724138
5724498,2,B00CJLQHAU,"The film opens with Mitch (Jason London) running for his life. He then flashback to 3 weeks earlier when he meets Amy (Danielle Harris) at a bar who gives him her number. They discuss the book ""Crime and Punishment"" which normally indicates a parallel plot (not likely as it is a Russian novel) or theme...such as it is okay to commit a crime for the greater good. Needless to say, this wasn't exploited to its potential.

Mitch falls in love with Amy after a brief intimate one night stand. He discovers she has a rich husband when he bangs on the door. The plot moves around with the many twists and turns as the St Louis Interstate system seen in the background. It spite of the action and the twists, the film is a bit of a lull. I didn't feel sorry for our main character who should have gotten out when he discovered the woman was married. While he wasn't unlikeable, he lacked qualities and personality needed to carry the film.

A lower tier rental at best.

5724521,5,B00CJLQHAU,"This plot sequence keeps one in suspense til the end.  It is a crime movie that exemplifies the southern spirit of sex and money.

If any of you have lived in the South like I have, or wonder what the South is like, you will see that the truth behind the obvious is best painted by the lyrics of a McEntire  song: ""Well, don't trust your soul to no back woods Southern lawyer. Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands...""

Try to do business in New Orleans, the Carolinas or Georgia and you'll see you are in a Fantastic movie set, just like this film!",1466208000,,570,4.201834862385321
