I always liked the Trial, which did something quite new for the series at its time, a serialized story arc spanning over all 14 episodes, and funnily enough one of the few Classic stories as timey-wimey as some of the new series many years later would be. The Valeyard is a great adversary for the Doctor and despite all the problems the production team then had to master, I think the resulting season 23 turned out very well.",1470182400,,759,4.614814814814815
