3060273,5,B001152THA,"Blood+ is a sequel to the 2001 Anime Film, Blood: The Last Vampire.  The series premiered in Japan in 2005 and then in the U.S. as part of the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim group in 2007.  The opening prologue is set during the Vietnam War as a young woman goes on a maniacal killing spree, killing monsters as well as innocent civilians and soldier.  Now cut ahead to Okinawa in 2005, that young woman, Saya, has been adopted by a former American Soldier, George, who runs a pub in Okinawa.  Kai has two brothers, also adopted by George, Kai, the older brother and Riku, the youngest of the children.

Saya has been living with George and her brothers for the past year but has no memory of anything before that.  Saya's peaceful life with her family is changed for ever when a horrific beast attacks her one evening in her high school.  A mysterious man intervenes, giving Saya a sword.  Saya cuts herself, allowing her blood to flow into grooves on the sword, and with a skill that she didn't realize she had, slays the beast.  The monster is a Chiroptean, giant, bat-like creatures possessing great strength, speed and almost total invulnerability.  They live on the blood of humans although they are not vampires in the traditional sense.  The only thing that can kill the Chiropteans is Saya's blood.

It's difficult summarizing Blood+ because there numerous sub-plots and a large roster of characters.  Saya's mysterious protector is her servant Haji, but she's also protected by a secret organization called ""Red Shield"" dedicated to destroying the Chiropteans.  In the first few episodes we'll learn part of Saya's background and how she came to be adopted by George.  Blood+ however, spoon feeds its mysteries.  We learn something new about Saya or the other characters in nearly every episode but the show's pacing is very deliberate.

The character development is among the very best I've ever seen in any Anime.  You get to know all of the characters and their personalities and it's hard not to develop an attachment to them.  Saya is not a gung-ho stereotypical heroine.  At times she's so reluctant to fight that it's frustrating.  Even when friends and family are in peril she has difficulty early on coming to grips with what she is and her abilities.  And just WHAT is Saya?  I'll not play spoiler and that's one of the mysteries that takes a while to be fully revealed.  Her reluctance to fight however does allow other characters such as Haji and Red Shield's Mr. David to shine with their own skills.

Blood+ has a different look than traditional Anime.  Combining traditional cell animation with CGI, it has a darker and grittier tone but also a fluidity that cell animation lacks.  At times it gives the look an almost dream-like quality.  The Chiropteans are often cloaked in shadows with just their blood-red eyes visible.  This is a bloody, often brutal series that pulls no punches.

You'll note that I listed the cast with the American voice actors.  This is because I watched the English audio as opposed to the Japanese audio.  I realize that this is sacrilege to Anime purists but when you're watching a DVD for the purpose to review it, and take notes, it's difficult to try and follow sub-titles as well.  The American voice actors are all extremely experience and have numerous Anime credits.

The boxed set includes the first 25 episodes of the series on five discs with the sixth disc featuring bonus material included extensive interviews.  The set also includes a Manga sampler booklet and an exclusive Blood+ T-shirt.

I can't claim to be an Anime fanatic or expert but Blood+ drew me into its world unlike any other series and it's one of the best I've seen.",1213574400,4,3698,4.768503937007874
3060274,3,B001152THA,"This anime was good - not quite as dark, artistic or intense as Blood the Last Vampire  - but still good.  The story and set up are interesting and the characters are fine.

The English dub isn't terrible, but it has it's moments.  The subtitles are a let down.  I hope that another edition will be released with complete subtitles rather than dubtitles.",1212451200,,354,4.555555555555555
3060275,3,B001152THA,"I've been looking forward to this release for a very, very long time, and it's almost everything I wanted. The packaging is good, the video and audio quality is good, and the show, of course, is excellent.

However, Sony, for some reason I can't begin to understand, did not give an English subtitle track for the Japanese audio. They instead have basically captions for the English dub track, which is close in meaning - but only close. If I wanted the English-dub dialogue I would be watching the English dub, but since I'm watching the Japanese audio I want a translation of what they're saying.

Based on this I'm very uncertain if I'll bother to buy part two of the series. I almost wish I could return this set, because the discrepancy between what I'm hearing and what I'm reading is VERY distracting.

If you're going to watch the English dub, by all means, buy this set. But if you want to watch with Japanese audio, I would really recommend avoiding it.",1205107200,18,963,4.587209302325581
3060276,3,B001152THA,"I was really looking forward to this DVD Box release... Blood Plus being one of my favorite series. However having seen Blood before (english sub before Sony picked up the show), watching this release now is painful many times over each episodes as the subtitles are taken form the english dub version and at times is ridiculously way off.

Dub-titles are a rip off. I can't believe they did that.",1204934400,16,397,4.671428571428572
3060277,4,B001152THA,"Another reviewer has already done a good review of the content, so mine shall focus on the physical characteristics of the merchandise.

The box:
The box is a stiff cardboard material with a removable (lift-top) lid. The lid is approximately 1"" deep and feels quite sturdy. There is a secondary cardboard insert glued to the bottom portion of the box that guides and holds the lid in place. The outer shell and lid are very well done, very clean lines and really good match on the artwork. The insert in mine however looked like a reject from a factory floor; the cardboard, although very sturdy, is frayed and very rough around the edges. For how nice the exterior box is, I am surprised at the look of the inner support.

The t-shirt and manga preview:
Yup, they were both there :). They were packed into the box along with the DVDs. I'm not big into these types of extras, so other than a quick glance at the manga they didn't get examined.

The discs:
There are three disks in thin-pak holders. Each of the first two disks holds 10 episodes, and the last disk contains 5 episodes plus some extras. Given that thin-paks for anime usually indicate ""bare-minimum"", I was a little put off by the thin-pak; however, the artwork did look clean on the disk covers, so it wasn't all bad. One peculiarity is that the DVDs by no means fill up much of the interior of the box. I'm not sure if the volume 2 DVDs (last half of the series) are intended to fit into this box or not, but once you take the t-shirt out the DVDs are no longer snug and secure in the box.

Summary:
The most important point of a box is that it is sturdy, and this one is. However, it is also there to protect and corral the DVDs into a secure container, and with the amount of extra space in the box, it does not meet this requirement (unless the rest of the series will be released as thin-paks and fit in this box).

So overall, 5 stars for content and 3 stars for packaging.

Most anime DVD sets in the States only have four episodes a disc.  You get 25 on this (that half of the series)!!  It is my all time favorite anime.  It is a dark, action packed vampire saga...BUT it has a lot of heart.  The storyline is bittersweet, sad and thought provoking.  You learn to like/love every good guy and depise the bad guys.  The characters are well rounded and it's all due to the writing.  Every main character goes through a journey of change.  If you love anime you need to watch this!!

3060279,5,B001152THA,I absolutely love this anime! It draws you in with the mysterious plot and keeps you intrigued with great action scenes and incredibly heart-wrenching storylines embedded within Saya's journey to discover herself. I highly recommend this anime!,1204070400,,244,5.621621621621622

3060281,4,B001152THA,"Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy mysterious people, or as bloodthirsty monsters. In ""Blood+,"" you get two for the price of one.

While this is technically a spinoff of ""Blood: The Last Vampire,"" this series stands easily on its own -- gallons of gore, taut action scenes, mystery, and a young vampire finding out the truth about the past she can't remember. And this boxed set -- containing the first half of the series -- is definitely worth getting.

Saya Otonashi is anemic, and she doesn't remember anything about her life before she was adopted by a kindly veteran, George, and his sons Kai and Riku. Other than that, she's a perfectly normal Okinawa schoolgirl. Then a monster -- a vampiric Chiropteran -- attacks her at her high school. She's saved by the mysterious Haji, who forces her to drink a little of his blood.

She destroys the monster in a matter of seconds -- unaware that her punky, overprotective brother Kai also saw the monster. And Saya's confusion only grows when she finds that George is discussing her mysterious past with a man named David, who is from a secret Chiropteran-fighting organization called Red Shield. When Saya's father is attacked and kidnapped, she, Kai and Haji all join the rescue effort.

And afterwards, they become a part of Red Shield, though Saya doesn't know why she is so vital to their mission. Her fight takes her across Vietnam and Russia, through bloodied jungles and Siberian wastelands -- and her own half-forgotten memories -- as David tries to track down a train car with someone called ""Diva"" inside. But then Saya is told the truth about her own nature -- and her relationship to the cruel Chiropteran queen, Diva....

While the original movie focused mainly on action, ""Blood+"" is more densely plotted, and more mysterious in its story. Primarily it's a horror/coming-of-age tale (with a bit of a love triangle), but there are also traces of mystery, comedy, horror and tragedy woven in here.

In fact, the writers juggle multiple storylines (including one about a reporter and a schoolgirl) with ease. They also spun up a rich, complex vampire mythology, with multiple vampire breeds -- the horrific bloodthirsty fiends, the sexy Chevaliers like Haji and Solomon, and the cruel, childish Diva. There's also the Schiff, hooded half-vampires who show up long enough to give Haji some new punctures, but don't yet have much effect on the storyline.

The animation is another exquisite part of the story -- detailed, realistic, and a bit gothic with all the shadows, pale light and old-world buildings. And there are some beautiful, striking images, like glowing blue roses, Saya's sword, and chateau ruins. But for all its beauty, ""Blood+"" is crammed with violence -- dismemberment, ripped-off faces, and buckets of blood from vampires and humans alike.

Saya can be a bit whiny, but her terror and confusion gradually iron out into a likable, somewhat tragic heroine. Haji takes awhile to be fleshed out, but he's a tragic, adoring character when he is, especially in the long flashbacks to his childhood and travels with Saya. And Crispin Freeman's vocals don't hurt the effect.

Kai is a particularly likable character, just because he's so normal -- an ordinary kid who is in over his head, and just trying to protect those he loves. All the supporting characters -- Riku, Julia, David and the cherubic Lewis -- are well-written. Even minor characters get plenty of detail, such as the Schiff and Diva's Chevaliers (particularly Solomon and the increasingly loopy Carl).

""Blood+: Part One"" is a violent, bittersweet start to a brilliant series, as well as a great spin on typical vampire stories. It'll also leave you desperately wanting to know what happens next.",1199318400,51,3737,4.9648
3060288,5,B001152THA,"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~

Saya Otanashi is so far just an amnesiac teenage girl. Yet, behind the surface she comes to discover in an event that will change her life forever that she isn't human at all. Saya is a member of chiropracterans (vampires but like the type you'd never expect at all, way freakier). Thse chiropterans live on blood and murder humans. She's also one of the few of her species. She alone can destroy these ugly monsters. Her blood contains amazing attributes that eventually destroy them. Saya must for the most part throughout struggle to recall her origins along with her very attractive protector Haji. Who I should say is bound to her most of the time. Nobody is willing who knows of what Saya is capable to tell her because as you soon realize is a closely guarded secret for a reason. That's until, BAM!, we are introduced to Diva. Diva is Saya's sister. She couldn't not be bothered. What she reveals to Saya and not at all gently turns Saya's world into a void of uncertainty. Saya somehow finds the strength to get over her past which is very turbulent. As we travel with Saya in the series, her adoptive human family, also make themselves available to assist her in destroying the chiropterans that are very bloodthirsty. Blood + has some of the most appealing animation I have witnessed. Contains the best drama which includes plot twists just so you know. In short an amazing anime watch that fans of anime with a taste of Science Fiction will love forever. Recommend so much!

3060289,5,B001152THA,"Blood+ is my favorite of all of the anime. The story is very strong and there are many great characters. The animation is dark but then so is the story. All of the emotions are present and you will find yourself excited to see the next episode. I will always want there to be a continuation but I promise you that it was not Blood-C.

This is a very rare anime so if you can find it - buy it. The package I received was new sealed and included everything, yes the t-shirt too.

You can find 4 individual discs as well but they do not contain the dubbed. I saw the dubbed first so it is my preference - it is Kari Wahlgren and I love her work.

3060291,4,B001152THA,"This is where Sony killed the R1 anime industry.  I love this anime (torrented each episode as it went up, saw it on adult swim, rented it from Netflix, and now own a fine bootleg copy of both seasons for $50 total), but $100+ per season for a poorly assembled DVD with no extras, over half of the show's animation farmed out to inferior houses (watch the background quality change all the time)?  Sorry, this is the perfect example of a big company deciding to screw the little guy.  And in the process crush a tiny anime industry that was already on the ropes.  It's a sad, ugly business.",1286928000,2,590,4.385321100917431
3060292,2,B001152THA,"To start off with, I love shows with strong female characters. Meaning girls/women who can stand on their own two feet and save the day without needing to be rescued. To put it bluntly, I enjoyed ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" because Saya was strong and could fend for herself. ""Blood+"" is another story. A drastically different story. They took everything that made Saya in the movie cool and strong and took it away. In the series, she's wimp who is always having to be rescued by Hagi. This is not cool.

Add to the fact that this show can't seem to decide what genre it wants to be. Shojo? Shonen? A nice family drama, magical girl, or an action/adventure flick? It just never seems to find its footing. Further, the plot is so drawn out it could have been told in half the amount of episodes it was. I mean how many times does Saya have to partake in some long exposition about not knowing about her past only to end with whomever she's talking to saying she will find out when she is ready? Four times at least. They drew out the mystery of her past for so long that I stopped caring.

Add to it plotlines that seem like filler, such as Mao and Akihiro tracking down Kai and Saya. We already know what is going on with them, so having them investigate it and learn all of the stuff we already know is boring.

And then there were the long, drawn out family speeches. About how families are important, and they stick together, and yadda yadda yadda. Talk about being heavy handed with a message over and over again. Hearing the same message about the importance of family in just about every episode is tedious. We get it already! Family is important! Please get back to the plot.

And the kicker is that none of the characters are that interesting and in some cases are downright annoying. Kai is a bad combination of overhyped on testosterone and overfed on melodrama. And Mao is just annoying.

It really feels as though someone accustomed to making action/adventure series decided to experiment with a magical girl thing but didn't know how to pull it off effectively. The characters are dull, the plot is spread too thin, and Saya is a grade A wuss. Save yourself some time and stick with the movie. It is a lot better.",1276387200,2,2225,4.457002457002457
3060293,4,B001152THA,Product arrived with worn packaging & obviously opened yet dvds were fine. Unexpected T shirt in new condition. Product itself is great entertainment.,1269129600,,150,5.565217391304348
3060294,3,B001152THA,"I'm a big fan of the original Blood:The Last Vampire, and had high hopes when I heard about this series.  In the very beginning, it looked like my hopes would be realized.  The first scene shows a blood-stained maniac Saya in Vietnam, and the movie ended with the implication that she would be heading there.  Cool.  Flash-forward ahead and now she's a school girl with memory loss and hints of something horrendously bad happening in her past.  Ok, could be groovy.  Let's see where this leads.  Enter some supporting characters, a new facet where Saya uses her actual blood to destroy the baddies (instead of bleeding them dry like the movie), and the hint of a split personality, with a more authentic-Saya alter-ego, and things had a lot of promise.  And then....
Suffice to say, as the series progresses, it becomes more apparent that this is NOT the same Saya as the movie.  That Saya was about as loveable as a cobra, and just as lethal.  She didn't really give a hoot if anyone liked her, and was perfectly fine with being a one-woman killing machine.  If anything, she seemed a little frustrated by agencies and directives that got in the way of her killing.  The series Saya is utterly weak, seems to topple like a house of cards at the least provocation, and is really only capable of accomplishing anything when she has no alternative.  If not for her assistant, Haji (who soaks up a titanic amount of damage for her), she wouldn't have made it through the first episode.  Add to all of this an endless amount of character exposition on the importance of family and friendship, kind of like Yu-Gi-Oh with vampires.  Typical dialog string: ""You don't have to worry about anything, because we're a family"" ""*gasp* a family?"" ""That's right, a family. And that means we'll do whatever it takes, no matter what!"" ""*Gasp* No matter what?""  ""No matter what, and that's forever!"" ""*gasp* Forever?""  Ugh.  My interpretation of the real Saya's version of this conversation: ""Shut up and get me a good sword"".
I think that, in addition to its technical features, the character of Saya was instrumental in the success of the movie, primarily because she was not the typical anime chick.  She didn't look like a Barbi doll with implants, she wasn't whiny and helpless, and she wasn't plagued by constant self-doubt.  On the flip side, she's not a prodigy, good at everything phenom either.  When it was hinted that she was very, very old it was believable, because she gave the impression of someone that had been around a while, and had experience doing what she was doing.  She tolerated others the way an adult tolerates children because, to her, that's what they were.  The series tosses all of that out the window in favor of the classic Saturday-morning anime, with a protagonist that is equally helpless and clueless.  It has the feel of a product that was not marketable to kids, so they had to make a PG version for mass consumption and decided to reinforce some good social stuff while they were at it.  Maybe they thougt so too, because the second season actually begins to move back to the original model a little, but gives up after three or four episodes and returns to form.  Which really is unfortuneate.  There was so much in the movie that could have been expounded upon, and even this same series design with the original characters would have been something else.
For all that, it's not a bad series.  The plot holds together well, and they manage to stay away from the paths most vampire themes trend down.  The characters are fairly well-defined, but so stereotypical they themselves joke about it sometimes.  The reluctant hero, the stoic defender, the passionate rebel, the innocent child.  Very by-the-book.  Worth a rental, don't know about buying.
As a last thought, the story of the original Saya is continued in other media: She shows up in a couple of Japanese PSP games (not available in the US), and in a manga that reveals her actual origin and ultimate destiny.  The manga is VERY disturbing, and I can see why the series chose to avoid that plot line.  It's just really unfortuneate.  The original Saya, creased brow/grey eyes and all, in this series would have been fantastic, and that's a shadow that just hangs over the whole series and ultimately ruined it for me.",1267574400,,4302,4.721179624664879

I had bought this series years ago when it first showed here on Adult Swim TV and got a cheaper copy/dub that came from China and while the video was good the translations sucked. I went back and bought the OEM produced product thru Amazon the fall of 2009 to add to my collection, cause I like it so much. Buy the original Sony product dubbed correctly unless your going to watch in original Japanese speak. They aren't cheap, but if your a true connesuir of top notch anime this set is on the must have list. These are very good anime, gets a little bogged down in the later half but does finish well, leaving you wanting more of these characters.

 So many people are better at reviewing than I am because I am not going to tell you the whole story in a review...I hate that. Which would explain why I am ranked like 5,608,144th as reviewers go..^_^
 Saya is the only sword wielding Vampire alive that is capable of killing these Chiropterans<-spelling? Her blood is poison to them. To start with Saya seems to be a normal teenager except that one year prior to when this story takes off...she has no memory of who she is or what she is for that fact. Suddenly Says is attacked and she has no idea why is this thing after her (enter Haji). Saya begins to remember bits of her past and keeps asking her servant (Haji) to tell her everything but he just tells her that she must remember on her own..or it is not his place, which adds to the mystery. Being a normal teenager with two brothers and a father it is hard for her to accept that she is such a vicious killer. As Saya tries to piece together her past the journey takes her to numerous places. Vietnam, Russia, France and everywhere Saya goes there is trouble due to the fact there are those who just wish to kill her. There are others (the Schiff) who believe Saya's blood will be the cure to their curse, which means they are trying to kill her as well. Then there is another in the enemy's ranks who belives Saya can be brought into there line of thinking. In other words there are several players in this story and it is not limited to just kill..kill...kill.
  Saya is afraid to fight...afraid to run yet she does not want the people around her to die.....what to do?
  Yes there plenty of gore and although the amount of blood coming out can be a bit over the top it does not lessen the story. If you are looking for an interesting story that provides numerous enjoyable chracters then you should like this.
  I liked this a lot and even though it left me hanging...I have seen it 3 times and not because I did not get it the first time but because I am a single guy that has no life...hehehe. So in my feeble mind it has good replay value because the story is rather in depth.
 These are not stand alone episodes so it plays well from start to finish.
I can not tell if you will like it but I can tell you the type of series that I like..Trinity Blood..Black Blood Brothers..Death Note..Hellsing..Last Exile. If you liked those then you might find this worth watching.
 I just wish it was not in Full Screen but the thinpaks are awesome. Just once you take out the T-Shirt that comes with it there is so much room in the case you have to put something else in its place or your disc's will move about.
 When it comes to the audio...the background music blends seemlessly with what you are watching. Also every disc defalts to the Japanese language with English subtitles.",1242086400,,2938,4.323636363636363

Blood+ avoids the problems many anime series have by having a plot that is intriguing and characters that develop through the series and who you genuinely care about.  It also actually has a good ending!  If you watch a lot of anime, you know how many series do not have satisfying endings.  The characters in Blood+ do not seem like the hundredth version of a stock character from other series; they're unique and complex.  The animation is beautiful and so is the music composed by Hans Zimmer.  There are also 4 opening and 4 closing theme songs for this series and they're all great; I think you only get to number 2 in this set. This show was always shown with a graphic violence warning on Adult Swim, and when there are battles, they are pretty bloody but not gratuitous.  Occasionally, the plot did slow up a little too much for me just when it seemed like something really big was going to happen between Saya and Diva, but I only minded because I was so into the story.  The most special thing about this show to me was the relationship between Saya and her adopted family and between her and Hagi.  This is one of the most moving anime series I've ever seen.  Saya goes through some of the hardest things that happen in real life, like losing a parent and sibling and feeling great remorse for something terrible that you've done in the past, then struggling with guilt and indecision.  The way these events were depicted was sometimes heartbreaking. These were real things that I could relate to and lift Blood+ far above a lot of other anime.

About the set itself:  I prefer dub to sub, but because I love this series so much, I did want to watch it in Japanese with an accurate translation, so was disappointed like other reviewers in the ""dubtitles.""  I also didn't like that you can't get the subtitles OFF of the theme songs.  I find them irritating as they obstruct the animation, which is why I prefer dubbing in the first place.

3060302,2,B001152THA,"First of all I have to say that being a huge fan of the movie this is based on is what brought me to the series, which I didn't even know existed until just a few months ago. In the beginning I was extremely enthused about seeing where this series would take the story from where the film left off, unfortunately that enthusiasm was short-lived.

I love the original movie the series is based on, but this follow up to the film does not do it justice whatsoever. I understand that whenever a series is made it has to flesh out the premise it's based on, unless it's already clearly established, but it wasn't with the original film which left the series with a daunting task.

Unfortunately, this was a terrible extension of the film, which was intriguing and mysterious, while this series was anything but. It completely changes the feel and essence of what the movie introduced, and might as well have been an entirely different series, and in retrospect, it should have, because as it stands it tarnishes the reputation of the film.

There's too much gratuitous violence as the series progresses, and the villains introduced are too clichd and one in particular, the Phantom, is way too over the top and is completely incongruous with the theme of the show, and it was actually the turning point where it began going downhill, he's that bad.  The Phantom makes the series seem like a day time soap opera, almost.

Too much time is spent on Saya's character coming into her own, and there's so much back and forth between her split personalities that it basically becomes a joke after awhile. If you're a fan of the film, skip this tripe, but if you haven't seen the film, then you might enjoy this since it has all the elements of any stereotypical teenage soap drama anime' and I know there are a lot of fans of that, but that doesn't do anything for me, intellectually or emotionally.",1225929600,3,1889,4.576923076923077

One of my favorite things about Blood+ is the dialogue. Blood+ has absolutely amazing dialogue that comes out as being very realistic and natural. While this is not a comedic anime, it does have plenty of well placed wit and sarcasm that kept me chuckling in all the right placed. Additionally, the characters, both good and evil, were amazing.

3060306,5,B001152THA,"I am a huge fan of Blood: the Last Vampire (I own the special dvd edition). I heard about this series and scheduled the episodes from Adult Swim on my Tivo.
While thematically it is a bit ""lighter"" in mood than the original 2001 film, it is nevertheless a very original story (and sequel) about a girl who discovers her legacy: she is the ancient progenitor of a race of bloodthirsty vampires. These vampires are classified into greater (can mask their appearance as humans) and lesser (more beast-like). The pacing is excellent, at points it is very much a character driven show, lots of plot twists and surprises. In terms of quality, the dub is good and the animation is top notch. Characterization is much more developed and richer than alot of anime's on the market. The particular rivalry and juxtaposition between Jaya and Diva is particularly memorable, the finale is not to be missed.
Overall, I think this is a worthy successor to the original movie Blood: the Last Vampire.  One drawback is the price: over $100 for part one only. Dunno when part Two is coming out, but Im hoping to buy these sometime soon (I missed several episodes on TV when it ran). Alot of detractors (who've reviewed it here) seem to compare it alot to the film its based on, but I think it should be seen on its own merits.",1221696000,,1308,4.56595744680851

Each episode as she takes on these creatures she is remembering some of her past life and you will be surprised when you get to the end of the first part of the series what I'm talking about.

3294770,5,B001152THA,"Blood+ is a sequel to the 2001 Anime Film, Blood: The Last Vampire.  The series premiered in Japan in 2005 and then in the U.S. as part of the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim group in 2007.  The opening prologue is set during the Vietnam War as a young woman goes on a maniacal killing spree, killing monsters as well as innocent civilians and soldier.  Now cut ahead to Okinawa in 2005, that young woman, Saya, has been adopted by a former American Soldier, George, who runs a pub in Okinawa.  Kai has two brothers, also adopted by George, Kai, the older brother and Riku, the youngest of the children.

Saya has been living with George and her brothers for the past year but has no memory of anything before that.  Saya's peaceful life with her family is changed for ever when a horrific beast attacks her one evening in her high school.  A mysterious man intervenes, giving Saya a sword.  Saya cuts herself, allowing her blood to flow into grooves on the sword, and with a skill that she didn't realize she had, slays the beast.  The monster is a Chiroptean, giant, bat-like creatures possessing great strength, speed and almost total invulnerability.  They live on the blood of humans although they are not vampires in the traditional sense.  The only thing that can kill the Chiropteans is Saya's blood.

It's difficult summarizing Blood+ because there numerous sub-plots and a large roster of characters.  Saya's mysterious protector is her servant Haji, but she's also protected by a secret organization called ""Red Shield"" dedicated to destroying the Chiropteans.  In the first few episodes we'll learn part of Saya's background and how she came to be adopted by George.  Blood+ however, spoon feeds its mysteries.  We learn something new about Saya or the other characters in nearly every episode but the show's pacing is very deliberate.

The character development is among the very best I've ever seen in any Anime.  You get to know all of the characters and their personalities and it's hard not to develop an attachment to them.  Saya is not a gung-ho stereotypical heroine.  At times she's so reluctant to fight that it's frustrating.  Even when friends and family are in peril she has difficulty early on coming to grips with what she is and her abilities.  And just WHAT is Saya?  I'll not play spoiler and that's one of the mysteries that takes a while to be fully revealed.  Her reluctance to fight however does allow other characters such as Haji and Red Shield's Mr. David to shine with their own skills.

Blood+ has a different look than traditional Anime.  Combining traditional cell animation with CGI, it has a darker and grittier tone but also a fluidity that cell animation lacks.  At times it gives the look an almost dream-like quality.  The Chiropteans are often cloaked in shadows with just their blood-red eyes visible.  This is a bloody, often brutal series that pulls no punches.

You'll note that I listed the cast with the American voice actors.  This is because I watched the English audio as opposed to the Japanese audio.  I realize that this is sacrilege to Anime purists but when you're watching a DVD for the purpose to review it, and take notes, it's difficult to try and follow sub-titles as well.  The American voice actors are all extremely experience and have numerous Anime credits.

The boxed set includes the first 25 episodes of the series on five discs with the sixth disc featuring bonus material included extensive interviews.  The set also includes a Manga sampler booklet and an exclusive Blood+ T-shirt.

I can't claim to be an Anime fanatic or expert but Blood+ drew me into its world unlike any other series and it's one of the best I've seen.",1213574400,4,3698,4.768503937007874

They instead have basically captions for the English dub track, which is close in meaning - but only close.

Based on this I'm very uncertain if I'll bother to buy part two of the series. I almost wish I could return this set, because the discrepancy between what I'm hearing and what I'm reading is VERY distracting.

3294774,4,B001152THA,"Another reviewer has already done a good review of the content, so mine shall focus on the physical characteristics of the merchandise.

The box:
The box is a stiff cardboard material with a removable (lift-top) lid. The lid is approximately 1"" deep and feels quite sturdy. There is a secondary cardboard insert glued to the bottom portion of the box that guides and holds the lid in place. The outer shell and lid are very well done, very clean lines and really good match on the artwork. The insert in mine however looked like a reject from a factory floor; the cardboard, although very sturdy, is frayed and very rough around the edges. For how nice the exterior box is, I am surprised at the look of the inner support.

The t-shirt and manga preview:
Yup, they were both there :). They were packed into the box along with the DVDs. I'm not big into these types of extras, so other than a quick glance at the manga they didn't get examined.

The discs:
There are three disks in thin-pak holders. Each of the first two disks holds 10 episodes, and the last disk contains 5 episodes plus some extras. Given that thin-paks for anime usually indicate ""bare-minimum"", I was a little put off by the thin-pak; however, the artwork did look clean on the disk covers, so it wasn't all bad. One peculiarity is that the DVDs by no means fill up much of the interior of the box. I'm not sure if the volume 2 DVDs (last half of the series) are intended to fit into this box or not, but once you take the t-shirt out the DVDs are no longer snug and secure in the box.

Summary:
The most important point of a box is that it is sturdy, and this one is. However, it is also there to protect and corral the DVDs into a secure container, and with the amount of extra space in the box, it does not meet this requirement (unless the rest of the series will be released as thin-paks and fit in this box).

So overall, 5 stars for content and 3 stars for packaging.

3294778,4,B001152THA,"Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy mysterious people, or as bloodthirsty monsters. In ""Blood+,"" you get two for the price of one.

While this is technically a spinoff of ""Blood: The Last Vampire,"" this series stands easily on its own -- gallons of gore, taut action scenes, mystery, and a young vampire finding out the truth about the past she can't remember. And this boxed set -- containing the first half of the series -- is definitely worth getting.

Saya Otonashi is anemic, and she doesn't remember anything about her life before she was adopted by a kindly veteran, George, and his sons Kai and Riku. Other than that, she's a perfectly normal Okinawa schoolgirl. Then a monster -- a vampiric Chiropteran -- attacks her at her high school. She's saved by the mysterious Haji, who forces her to drink a little of his blood.

She destroys the monster in a matter of seconds -- unaware that her punky, overprotective brother Kai also saw the monster. And Saya's confusion only grows when she finds that George is discussing her mysterious past with a man named David, who is from a secret Chiropteran-fighting organization called Red Shield. When Saya's father is attacked and kidnapped, she, Kai and Haji all join the rescue effort.

And afterwards, they become a part of Red Shield, though Saya doesn't know why she is so vital to their mission. Her fight takes her across Vietnam and Russia, through bloodied jungles and Siberian wastelands -- and her own half-forgotten memories -- as David tries to track down a train car with someone called ""Diva"" inside. But then Saya is told the truth about her own nature -- and her relationship to the cruel Chiropteran queen, Diva....

While the original movie focused mainly on action, ""Blood+"" is more densely plotted, and more mysterious in its story. Primarily it's a horror/coming-of-age tale (with a bit of a love triangle), but there are also traces of mystery, comedy, horror and tragedy woven in here.

In fact, the writers juggle multiple storylines (including one about a reporter and a schoolgirl) with ease. They also spun up a rich, complex vampire mythology, with multiple vampire breeds -- the horrific bloodthirsty fiends, the sexy Chevaliers like Haji and Solomon, and the cruel, childish Diva. There's also the Schiff, hooded half-vampires who show up long enough to give Haji some new punctures, but don't yet have much effect on the storyline.

The animation is another exquisite part of the story -- detailed, realistic, and a bit gothic with all the shadows, pale light and old-world buildings. And there are some beautiful, striking images, like glowing blue roses, Saya's sword, and chateau ruins. But for all its beauty, ""Blood+"" is crammed with violence -- dismemberment, ripped-off faces, and buckets of blood from vampires and humans alike.

Saya can be a bit whiny, but her terror and confusion gradually iron out into a likable, somewhat tragic heroine. Haji takes awhile to be fleshed out, but he's a tragic, adoring character when he is, especially in the long flashbacks to his childhood and travels with Saya. And Crispin Freeman's vocals don't hurt the effect.

Kai is a particularly likable character, just because he's so normal -- an ordinary kid who is in over his head, and just trying to protect those he loves. All the supporting characters -- Riku, Julia, David and the cherubic Lewis -- are well-written. Even minor characters get plenty of detail, such as the Schiff and Diva's Chevaliers (particularly Solomon and the increasingly loopy Carl).

""Blood+: Part One"" is a violent, bittersweet start to a brilliant series, as well as a great spin on typical vampire stories. It'll also leave you desperately wanting to know what happens next.",1199318400,51,3737,4.9648

Saya Otanashi is so far just an amnesiac teenage girl. Yet, behind the surface she comes to discover in an event that will change her life forever that she isn't human at all. Saya is a member of chiropracterans (vampires but like the type you'd never expect at all, way freakier). Thse chiropterans live on blood and murder humans. She's also one of the few of her species. She alone can destroy these ugly monsters. Her blood contains amazing attributes that eventually destroy them. Saya must for the most part throughout struggle to recall her origins along with her very attractive protector Haji. Who I should say is bound to her most of the time. Nobody is willing who knows of what Saya is capable to tell her because as you soon realize is a closely guarded secret for a reason. That's until, BAM!, we are introduced to Diva. Diva is Saya's sister. She couldn't not be bothered. What she reveals to Saya and not at all gently turns Saya's world into a void of uncertainty. Saya somehow finds the strength to get over her past which is very turbulent. As we travel with Saya in the series, her adoptive human family, also make themselves available to assist her in destroying the chiropterans that are very bloodthirsty. Blood + has some of the most appealing animation I have witnessed. Contains the best drama which includes plot twists just so you know. In short an amazing anime watch that fans of anime with a taste of Science Fiction will love forever. Recommend so much!

3294789,2,B001152THA,"To start off with, I love shows with strong female characters. Meaning girls/women who can stand on their own two feet and save the day without needing to be rescued. To put it bluntly, I enjoyed ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" because Saya was strong and could fend for herself. ""Blood+"" is another story. A drastically different story. They took everything that made Saya in the movie cool and strong and took it away. In the series, she's wimp who is always having to be rescued by Hagi. This is not cool.

Add to the fact that this show can't seem to decide what genre it wants to be. Shojo? Shonen? A nice family drama, magical girl, or an action/adventure flick? It just never seems to find its footing. Further, the plot is so drawn out it could have been told in half the amount of episodes it was. I mean how many times does Saya have to partake in some long exposition about not knowing about her past only to end with whomever she's talking to saying she will find out when she is ready? Four times at least. They drew out the mystery of her past for so long that I stopped caring.

Add to it plotlines that seem like filler, such as Mao and Akihiro tracking down Kai and Saya. We already know what is going on with them, so having them investigate it and learn all of the stuff we already know is boring.

And then there were the long, drawn out family speeches. About how families are important, and they stick together, and yadda yadda yadda. Talk about being heavy handed with a message over and over again. Hearing the same message about the importance of family in just about every episode is tedious. We get it already! Family is important! Please get back to the plot.

And the kicker is that none of the characters are that interesting and in some cases are downright annoying. Kai is a bad combination of overhyped on testosterone and overfed on melodrama. And Mao is just annoying.

It really feels as though someone accustomed to making action/adventure series decided to experiment with a magical girl thing but didn't know how to pull it off effectively. The characters are dull, the plot is spread too thin, and Saya is a grade A wuss. Save yourself some time and stick with the movie. It is a lot better.",1276387200,2,2225,4.457002457002457

3294791,3,B001152THA,"I'm a big fan of the original Blood:The Last Vampire, and had high hopes when I heard about this series.  In the very beginning, it looked like my hopes would be realized.  The first scene shows a blood-stained maniac Saya in Vietnam, and the movie ended with the implication that she would be heading there.  Cool.  Flash-forward ahead and now she's a school girl with memory loss and hints of something horrendously bad happening in her past.  Ok, could be groovy.  Let's see where this leads.  Enter some supporting characters, a new facet where Saya uses her actual blood to destroy the baddies (instead of bleeding them dry like the movie), and the hint of a split personality, with a more authentic-Saya alter-ego, and things had a lot of promise.  And then....
Suffice to say, as the series progresses, it becomes more apparent that this is NOT the same Saya as the movie.  That Saya was about as loveable as a cobra, and just as lethal.  She didn't really give a hoot if anyone liked her, and was perfectly fine with being a one-woman killing machine.  If anything, she seemed a little frustrated by agencies and directives that got in the way of her killing.  The series Saya is utterly weak, seems to topple like a house of cards at the least provocation, and is really only capable of accomplishing anything when she has no alternative.  If not for her assistant, Haji (who soaks up a titanic amount of damage for her), she wouldn't have made it through the first episode.  Add to all of this an endless amount of character exposition on the importance of family and friendship, kind of like Yu-Gi-Oh with vampires.  Typical dialog string: ""You don't have to worry about anything, because we're a family"" ""*gasp* a family?"" ""That's right, a family. And that means we'll do whatever it takes, no matter what!"" ""*Gasp* No matter what?""  ""No matter what, and that's forever!"" ""*gasp* Forever?""  Ugh.  My interpretation of the real Saya's version of this conversation: ""Shut up and get me a good sword"".
I think that, in addition to its technical features, the character of Saya was instrumental in the success of the movie, primarily because she was not the typical anime chick.  She didn't look like a Barbi doll with implants, she wasn't whiny and helpless, and she wasn't plagued by constant self-doubt.  On the flip side, she's not a prodigy, good at everything phenom either.  When it was hinted that she was very, very old it was believable, because she gave the impression of someone that had been around a while, and had experience doing what she was doing.  She tolerated others the way an adult tolerates children because, to her, that's what they were.  The series tosses all of that out the window in favor of the classic Saturday-morning anime, with a protagonist that is equally helpless and clueless.  It has the feel of a product that was not marketable to kids, so they had to make a PG version for mass consumption and decided to reinforce some good social stuff while they were at it.  Maybe they thougt so too, because the second season actually begins to move back to the original model a little, but gives up after three or four episodes and returns to form.  Which really is unfortuneate.  There was so much in the movie that could have been expounded upon, and even this same series design with the original characters would have been something else.
For all that, it's not a bad series.  The plot holds together well, and they manage to stay away from the paths most vampire themes trend down.  The characters are fairly well-defined, but so stereotypical they themselves joke about it sometimes.  The reluctant hero, the stoic defender, the passionate rebel, the innocent child.  Very by-the-book.  Worth a rental, don't know about buying.
As a last thought, the story of the original Saya is continued in other media: She shows up in a couple of Japanese PSP games (not available in the US), and in a manga that reveals her actual origin and ultimate destiny.  The manga is VERY disturbing, and I can see why the series chose to avoid that plot line.  It's just really unfortuneate.  The original Saya, creased brow/grey eyes and all, in this series would have been fantastic, and that's a shadow that just hangs over the whole series and ultimately ruined it for me.",1267574400,,4302,4.721179624664879

Buy the original Sony product dubbed correctly unless your going to watch in original Japanese speak. They aren't cheap, but if your a true connesuir of top notch anime this set is on the must have list. These are very good anime, gets a little bogged down in the later half but does finish well, leaving you wanting more of these characters. Was really wanting to see Saya and Kai get it on, but its platonic so far as he considers her his little sister, and Haji would be a problem, too. If you don't know what I'm talking about, get this, and Part II, you won't be sorry.",1260489600,,1043,4.1940298507462686

3294794,4,B001152THA,"Like I said...this is ""Part 1""... Part two is coming Oct 20th.. ^_^ So when it comes to ending...do not expect one because this is a 50 episode series.
 So many people are better at reviewing than I am because I am not going to tell you the whole story in a review...I hate that. Which would explain why I am ranked like 5,608,144th as reviewers go..^_^
 Saya is the only sword wielding Vampire alive that is capable of killing these Chiropterans<-spelling? Her blood is poison to them. To start with Saya seems to be a normal teenager except that one year prior to when this story takes off...she has no memory of who she is or what she is for that fact. Suddenly Says is attacked and she has no idea why is this thing after her (enter Haji). Saya begins to remember bits of her past and keeps asking her servant (Haji) to tell her everything but he just tells her that she must remember on her own..or it is not his place, which adds to the mystery. Being a normal teenager with two brothers and a father it is hard for her to accept that she is such a vicious killer. As Saya tries to piece together her past the journey takes her to numerous places. Vietnam, Russia, France and everywhere Saya goes there is trouble due to the fact there are those who just wish to kill her. There are others (the Schiff) who believe Saya's blood will be the cure to their curse, which means they are trying to kill her as well. Then there is another in the enemy's ranks who belives Saya can be brought into there line of thinking. In other words there are several players in this story and it is not limited to just kill..kill...kill.
  Saya is afraid to fight...afraid to run yet she does not want the people around her to die.....what to do?
  Yes there plenty of gore and although the amount of blood coming out can be a bit over the top it does not lessen the story. If you are looking for an interesting story that provides numerous enjoyable chracters then you should like this.
  I liked this a lot and even though it left me hanging...I have seen it 3 times and not because I did not get it the first time but because I am a single guy that has no life...hehehe. So in my feeble mind it has good replay value because the story is rather in depth.
 These are not stand alone episodes so it plays well from start to finish.
I can not tell if you will like it but I can tell you the type of series that I like..Trinity Blood..Black Blood Brothers..Death Note..Hellsing..Last Exile. If you liked those then you might find this worth watching.
 I just wish it was not in Full Screen but the thinpaks are awesome. Just once you take out the T-Shirt that comes with it there is so much room in the case you have to put something else in its place or your disc's will move about.
 When it comes to the audio...the background music blends seemlessly with what you are watching. Also every disc defalts to the Japanese language with English subtitles.",1242086400,,2938,4.323636363636363
3294795,5,B001152THA,"I'm rating the anime as a whole a 5/5. However, this box-set only includes the first season which hardly concludes the central plot of Blood+.

Blood+ avoids the problems many anime series have by having a plot that is intriguing and characters that develop through the series and who you genuinely care about.  It also actually has a good ending!  If you watch a lot of anime, you know how many series do not have satisfying endings.  The characters in Blood+ do not seem like the hundredth version of a stock character from other series; they're unique and complex.  The animation is beautiful and so is the music composed by Hans Zimmer.  There are also 4 opening and 4 closing theme songs for this series and they're all great; I think you only get to number 2 in this set. This show was always shown with a graphic violence warning on Adult Swim, and when there are battles, they are pretty bloody but not gratuitous.  Occasionally, the plot did slow up a little too much for me just when it seemed like something really big was going to happen between Saya and Diva, but I only minded because I was so into the story.  The most special thing about this show to me was the relationship between Saya and her adopted family and between her and Hagi.  This is one of the most moving anime series I've ever seen.  Saya goes through some of the hardest things that happen in real life, like losing a parent and sibling and feeling great remorse for something terrible that you've done in the past, then struggling with guilt and indecision.  The way these events were depicted was sometimes heartbreaking. These were real things that I could relate to and lift Blood+ far above a lot of other anime.

About the set itself:  I prefer dub to sub, but because I love this series so much, I did want to watch it in Japanese with an accurate translation, so was disappointed like other reviewers in the ""dubtitles.""  I also didn't like that you can't get the subtitles OFF of the theme songs.  I find them irritating as they obstruct the animation, which is why I prefer dubbing in the first place.  I usually switch the subtitles to Korean because it blends in better.  The box comes with a T-shirt and a manga sampler; if you remove these, as I would like to, it makes the box too big for the DVDs and they rattle around.  The bonus disc of interviews with the Japanese voice cast was more interesting than I usually find these features to be.",1229904000,11,2336,4.510688836104513

Action fans are going to find more enough battles within this set to fill their quotas but fans who are seeking a story that has a bit more substance or emotional impact will find their patience long gone before they find their fix.",1228608000,,399,4.2631578947368425
3294799,2,B001152THA,"First of all I have to say that being a huge fan of the movie this is based on is what brought me to the series, which I didn't even know existed until just a few months ago. In the beginning I was extremely enthused about seeing where this series would take the story from where the film left off, unfortunately that enthusiasm was short-lived.

I love the original movie the series is based on, but this follow up to the film does not do it justice whatsoever. I understand that whenever a series is made it has to flesh out the premise it's based on, unless it's already clearly established, but it wasn't with the original film which left the series with a daunting task.

Unfortunately, this was a terrible extension of the film, which was intriguing and mysterious, while this series was anything but. It completely changes the feel and essence of what the movie introduced, and might as well have been an entirely different series, and in retrospect, it should have, because as it stands it tarnishes the reputation of the film.

There's too much gratuitous violence as the series progresses, and the villains introduced are too clichd and one in particular, the Phantom, is way too over the top and is completely incongruous with the theme of the show, and it was actually the turning point where it began going downhill, he's that bad.  The Phantom makes the series seem like a day time soap opera, almost.

Too much time is spent on Saya's character coming into her own, and there's so much back and forth between her split personalities that it basically becomes a joke after awhile. If you're a fan of the film, skip this tripe, but if you haven't seen the film, then you might enjoy this since it has all the elements of any stereotypical teenage soap drama anime' and I know there are a lot of fans of that, but that doesn't do anything for me, intellectually or emotionally.",1225929600,3,1889,4.576923076923077
3294800,5,B001152THA,"I expected just another horror movie; something along the lines of Blood Trinity. But what I got was anything but. Blood+ is a very serious anime; it asks the serious questions that all great literature must address; topics such as love, free will, and, good and evil. One of my favorite things about Blood+ is the dialogue. Blood+ has absolutely amazing dialogue that comes out as being very realistic and natural. While this is not a comedic anime, it does have plenty of well placed wit and sarcasm that kept me chuckling in all the right placed. Additionally, the characters, both good and evil, were amazing. Not only did I sympathize with the good guyss, and enjoyed watching them grow and develop, I also sympathized with the bad guys, especially the Schiff who were one of my favorite parts of the movie.",1225065600,,812,4.725352112676056

Worth getting with the prequel movie (Blood: Vampire Hunter) even though the movie is half a click lower in quality IMO.

3294803,5,B001152THA,"I am a huge fan of Blood: the Last Vampire (I own the special dvd edition). I heard about this series and scheduled the episodes from Adult Swim on my Tivo.
While thematically it is a bit ""lighter"" in mood than the original 2001 film, it is nevertheless a very original story (and sequel) about a girl who discovers her legacy: she is the ancient progenitor of a race of bloodthirsty vampires. These vampires are classified into greater (can mask their appearance as humans) and lesser (more beast-like). The pacing is excellent, at points it is very much a character driven show, lots of plot twists and surprises. In terms of quality, the dub is good and the animation is top notch. Characterization is much more developed and richer than alot of anime's on the market. The particular rivalry and juxtaposition between Jaya and Diva is particularly memorable, the finale is not to be missed.
Overall, I think this is a worthy successor to the original movie Blood: the Last Vampire.  One drawback is the price: over $100 for part one only. Dunno when part Two is coming out, but Im hoping to buy these sometime soon (I missed several episodes on TV when it ran). Alot of detractors (who've reviewed it here) seem to compare it alot to the film its based on, but I think it should be seen on its own merits.",1221696000,,1308,4.56595744680851

Each episode as she takes on these creatures she is remembering some of her past life and you will be surprised when you get to the end of the first part of the series what I'm talking about.

8240489,3,B001152THA,"Taking place in Okinawa, a young girl by the name of Saya is living comfortably with her foster father and two foster brothers. They appear to have formed the perfect family and Saya couldn't be any happier. Later, when monsters appear killing people and leaving them drained of blood. Saya finds herself in battle with one, and she's given a sword by a mysterious figure whom appears to be either an old servant or a friend. Next, a man named David appears revealing that Saya is the only one capable of killing these creatures. Who or what is Saya? And who or what are these creatures appearing that she must do battle with? -summary

I have to come right out the gate and mention that I didn't like the original movie Blood the Last Vampire. It was nothing more than an exercise in advanced animation techniques. I praised it for its very sharp attention to detail in regards to the visuals. However, I thought it was very close to worthless in other areas. The story left a lot to be explored, and when I heard about Blood+ years ago being a 50 episode series based on Saya, I figured here goes that missing part to the story. Contrary to what some folks would have you believe; Blood+ is not a sequel to the original movie, and the creators have made no attempt to tie the two together. This is a separate story altogether that examines Saya from a different perspective and explores her origin. This set Blood + Volume One contains the first 25 episodes of the series.

The first area I must hit on are the production values. In regards to the visuals, Blood+ is very beautiful with some very fluid animation frame by frame. If these visuals aren't top notch, then they are about as close an anime TV series can possibly get. The animation delivers some very good battles without the use of constant reused cels, and the backgrounds are simply gorgeous as they effectively combine with the CG. The ocean, river, and snow laden backdrops are outstanding, and it's the little things that appealed to my senses like high speed trains going by in the night time. The character designs are also very pretty, and I thought it was a plus that the old school girl uniform wasn't being used to death, to give anime perverts something to constantly drool over. Saya is seen in many different types of clothes, and most of the time she is very conservative. The fan service is kept pretty low and this is not something you will hear me complain about ever. The soundtrack is also very well composed with some of the dramatic scenes being supported by a slow paced, melancholic piano backdrop. The opening and ending credits have some pretty nice themes as well, and mid-way through the season a new theme song and opening appears.

Despite the heavy action feel of the original movie. Blood + is actually a lot more character driven. Now don't get me wrong, there are several action scenes with some good sword fighting and heavy gore; but the characters are the main focus and I consider them a mixed bag for the most part. Saya is heavily developed as the story deals a lot more with her human side, and most of the side characters are nothing more than mere stereotypes, and even though some may have a bit of depth, it makes several of them no less annoying. The series features a great amount of suspense and the viewer would more than likely be gripped to the screen while waiting for the next revelation. The plot follows Saya as she begins to exterminate the creatures called Chiropterans. Along the way, there are certain factions introduced and the lead antogonist is also revealed. This character plays a huge role in Saya's origin, as well as the events that were set in motion.

The series has its good moments, but I do not find this half as great as some folks would have one believe. The series has some pacing issues at this point, because it juggles other side stories, and at this point, one is completely uninteresting featuring a reporter searching for a major story, and a very annoying love sick girl who decided to tag along. These little segments interfere with the flow and a couple don't really add anything to the main story, at least not at this point; but I think these segments will differ from person to person all depending on how much they bought into the characters. Since I don't really care for all of them, some of the segments really didn't appeal to me much.

There's one area I will give this series credit in, and that's in regards to tonal consistency. There are some brief moments of comedy injected, but it's not the least bit forced nor does it distract from the serious nature of the content unlike Hellsing Ultimate, which is heavily damaged by its shifts in comedic moments. When looking at the style of Blood+ I have to say it's well written. In any case, this first half is indeed watchable and if possible give this anime a shot.

Pros: Production values, suspense, action, developed characters

Cons: Too many characters, pacing issues",1451260800,,4983,4.5984251968503935
