2219024,1,B0007LPS2W,"I came on this on television and happened to turn it on late.  So the major portion of the movie I saw was of Ken Welsh as Watson.  Welsh did a very good job and scenery was beautiful.  Unfortunately, I watched the entire movie.  Max Headroom as Sherlock is not something I ever wanted to see!

The guy doesn't even have a period haircut. He'd got his Max Headroom haircut.  He could of at least had sideburns and tried to look the part.

Frewer could have tired to act like Sherlock Holmes instead of trying to mold homes into Max Headroom.  Sherlock as flippant does not work. Neither does the borderline forced humor. In fact, the other actors also seem to do poorly (with the noted exception of Welsh) when Frewer is acting.

There are loads of good versions out there. Basil and Jeremy, and probably (though I haven't seen his version) Ian.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/dp/B00007G1WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/dp/B0001DCYBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Bell-and-Mr-Doyle-The-Dark-Beginnings-of-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B00009WVM1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes</a>

So either skip this, or fast forward whenever Frewer is on and only watch Welsh.",1250380800,3,1587,6.811881188118812
2219025,2,B0007LPS2W,"After having viewed nearly all film versions of ""The Hound of the Baskerville"" as well as read the novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I have to say that this Hallmark version is not the best. Certainly, it contains more action then some of the other versions, but it is not very realistic to the story and leaves out many important scenes.

Now, you may enjoy a faster paced film, and sometimes I do, also. However, I cannot stand Matt Frewer as Sherlock Holmes (he is very cynical), and Kenneth Welsh is too elderly to play a reasonable Dr. Watson.

My recommendation is as follows: If you want the most loyal version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" purchase the 120 minute version starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke. While the Brett version is not perfect and shows a low production cost, it is definitely more watchable than the Hallmark version. Also, Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke are good actors to play Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

For viewers who want a more exciting version of the film that is still somewhat true to the novel, I recommend the 80 minute version black and white version starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Just make certain you buy the Rathbone DVD transfer ASIN: B0001DCYBE from MPI rather than some poor DVD transfer.

Now, of course there are many other versions of this film. If you have the money, you could purchase them all and compare. However, I believe what I have written above is accurate (as least for this Sherlockian).",1217635200,4,1482,4.710424710424711
2219026,5,B0007LPS2W,"I am surprised at the hostility of several reviewers to these very interesting and atmospheric Sherlock Holmes' stories.

 As a fan of Conan Doyle's stories  in print and on film since childhood, I think Matt Frewer is by far the best screen emodiment of Holmes.  Yes, better than the great Basil Rathbone.  And that's saying something, I know.  Frewer's arrogance, cynicism and touch of self-aggrandizement are just about perfect.  To say nothing of the physicality of Frewer's take on Holmes.  And of course there's that marvelolous voice with it's barely concealed snobbishly modulated hyper upper-class inflection.

The Sherlock Holmes Collection (""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" ""The Sign of the Four,"" ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire"" and ""The Royal Scandal"") are not big budget productions, but they are effective and entertaining and the screenplay interpretations of these familiar public domain stories are fresh. However, it's Frewer who makes it worth every penny (or should I say farthing?).

My favorite is the creepy ""The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire.""",1194566400,7,1076,5.351190476190476
2219027,1,B0007LPS2W,"I've seen every Hound adaptation on DVD and this is the worst one by far.  I don't mind Frewer's Holmes too much, and I found Welsh's Watson to be serviceable, but there are two things that completely sink this movie.

First, many of the high points of the story are completely absent!  It literally ends about 3/4s of the way through the story without an abrupt, pointless ending.  Much of the fun of the story is missing...discovery of Holmes on the moor?  No.  Mention of the villain as a throwback to Sir Hugo?  No.  I could go on.  The ending is particularly dumb - the motivation of the villain is never explained...if you'd never read the story, you'd be wondering why he did it.  And of course, he throws himself into the open in full view of everyone without a prayer of realizing his ambitions.  Easily the worst screenplay of Hound ever written.

Second, the atmosphere is uneven.  The London scenes are good and the Baskerville Hall interiors are well done, but the moor looks like a schoolyard park...dark and foreboding?  Hardly.  It looks like a travel brochure for Ireland.

There are so many other good adaptations - Brett's, Ian Richardson's, etc.  Skip this piece of junk.",1193011200,17,1191,4.676328502415459
2219028,1,B0007LPS2W,"I really don't want to waste too much time reviewing this movie.  In fact, I wasn't going to write a review at all, until I saw the average five star rating.  It turns out, the other review here is an advertisement, which is perfectly legal...why not?

But I must warn you, this is an AWFUL adaptation of Hound of the Baskervilles.  While Kenneth Walsh is a very good, though somewhat elderly Watson, Frewer is embarrassing to Watch as Holmes.  In an interview, Frewer claimed that Brett did not play up Holmes' intellect enough.  If you Watch Frewer's Sherlock films, not only will you see a performance that lacks intellect, but falls into the kind of accidental slapstick that Monty Python would praise and try to emulate for true comedy.

Perhaps it is because I am a fan of Brett that I was so turned off by this particular production.  But looking again at my collection, I have both Cushing performances (excellent), the Rathbone movie (also excellent), the Roxburgh adaptation (I might be spelling his name wrong..that version had atmosphere, but misfired on the relationship between Holmes and Watson), and this version simply does not stand on its own for any reason I can think of.  In fact, it sinks deep into the proverbial mire.

There are so many wonderful Sherlock Holmes movies out there...why waste your ninety minutes and your money?",1169769600,23,1352,4.813852813852814

8048457,3,B0007LPS2W,"I got this one after seeing part of it played on t.v.
Let me just say, any real fan of mystery of any kind knows the thrill of the story is in wondering what is afoot, watching the thing be solved or in waiting until the end to discover the solution if you can't unravel it yourself. If I had not known the answer from reading Hound of the Baskervilles previously, and it being one of my favorite Holmes stories, I would have been even more disappointed that the solution is given away right at the beginning, leaving little reason to sit through it.",1486598400,,550,4.298076923076923

8048459,4,B0007LPS2W,"I decided to take time to write a short review of this film, mainly because it doesn't seem to be receiving quite the amount of the credit it deserves. In my opnion.
Firstly, a few words on the main characters. Matt Frewer is, admittedly, a different Sherlock to the one we are used to see. But again, not that different, and certainly not as different, or ""over-the-top"", as described by some reviewers. In fact he gives a quite splendid and very convincing performance, with a flawless, or near-flawless, English accent, portraying the usual trademarks skills of the great detective whilst adding a touch of humour and, may I say, at times almost joyfulness. All done without compromising the integrity of the character.
It goes without saying that Kenneth Walsh is the perfect Watson. Intelligent, loyal, trustworthy and very, very English. Not at all a poor achievement, and for a Canadian/American actor at that.
As for the setting of the film, Victorian London is quite well achieved in what I suspect might be Toronto. The landscape is perhaps a bit more Canada than Devonshire in appearance (having said that I have never been to either place), but still beautiful, haunting and absolutely convincing in terms of achieving the proper atmosphere for the events.
The script does not follow the original to a hundred percent, but neither does a great many of the dramatisations made for television or cinema over the years. It is well written, well filmed and well executed, and one certainly gets the feel of the place, and of the dark and haunting danger of the moors.
All in all this film is not the best Hound ever made. That title will certainly, and for always, go to the Peter Cushing BBC adaptation, in my opinion closely followed by the blistering Sovjet version with the great Vasily Livanov in the role.
But apart from these two, this is as good a Hound as most, and better than quite a few. Perhaps not quite on par with the Ian Richardson version, but very close. I cannot really find a bad word to say about it, and the only reason I restrict myself to giving four stars, is that the two above mentioned versions set such a high standard.
In short, highly recommended viewing. I might add that the other Canadian films starring Frewer and Walsh are all equally good and well worth watching if you are a Holmes fan.",1454025600,,2333,4.706601466992665

8048462,5,B0007LPS2W,Im not sure what you others have watched because this is a great movie. I wish they would do more of the other movies like the study of scarlet or any of the other Sherlock Holmes stories. you don't know a good acting when you see it.,1391299200,3,234,4.0
8048463,5,B0007LPS2W,"Matt Frewer is certainly a ""new"" Sherlock and my guess is that most people either love him or hate him.  He is certainly not Jeremy Britt, but I liked his approach to Holmes.  Kenneth Welsh is a perfect Watson to Frewer's Holmes.  The Hound is my favorite of all Sherlock Holms stories.  I have seen most (if not all) adaptions.  I give this one a 4.5 out of 5.

8048465,4,B0007LPS2W,"Years ago I wrote negative review of the VHS edition of this movie, but time (and multiple re-watching) have mellowed me to some extent.  It is true that Matt Frewer's overacting (not to mention his strange accent) are, at times, hard to take, but it is also true that Kenneth Welsh is excellent as Dr. Watson and the Canadian countryside doubling as the Moor is nice.  Truth be told, this is the SH story which depends the least on The Great Detective since he is absent for so much of the time.  There are at least seven different DVD versions of Hound of the Baskervilles, and there is something to love (and not) about each of them.  All in all, this movie is worth watching and is a bargain of a price.",1265500800,2,707,4.333333333333333
