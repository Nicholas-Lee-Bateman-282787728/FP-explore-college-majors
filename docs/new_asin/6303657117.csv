7852165,1,6303657117,"Ballad of Death Valley is better known as A Pistol for Ringo, Giuliano Gemma's most famous spaghetti western, although he is billed under the name Montgomery Wood on this tape. I am a big spaghetti western fan, and I chased this movie down because it was popular among genre fans in the 60s when it came out, but is now hard to find.

Well, I was sorely disappointed. The plot is very routine, the music by the great Ennio Morricone is not his best work and there isn't much of it, the fight scenes are boring, and the sets are unimaginative. In addition, this tape is a bad full screen pan and scan copy, the colors are washed out, and the image is kind of fuzzy.

Look, I'm a big fan of spaghetti westerns, even the ones not directed by Sergio Leone, and irrespective of this I thought this movie was subpar. For that reason, there is absolutely no reason for non-genre fans to seek it out. For genre fans, if you want to see this movie as a part of your spaghetti western education, this is a good copy to buy because as of this writing it's available cheaply, albeit only used from third-party vendors, and I don't recommend anyone shell out the big money for the much more expensive (and probably better quality) DVD that is available in the Japanese Macaroni Western Bible series.",1192320000,,1286,4.444915254237288
