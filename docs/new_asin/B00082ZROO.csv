I SAT DOWN AND WATCHED THIS DVD WITH MY 7 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE ALSO LIKED IT.  I WISH THERE WERE MORE SHOWS ON TV LIKE SKY KING AND FURY, SO SIMPLE BUT OH, SO GOOD!",1202688000,3,307,3.8412698412698414

2257118,5,B00082ZROO,"As a child of the 50's it was fun getting to watch Sky King again. There were even some old ads included. I doubt my grandkids would sit still for any of these but I sure enjoyed seeing Sky and Penny. There is a good website devoted to the show, do a Google search for it and you'll find it.",1171756800,22,291,3.8666666666666667
2257119,5,B00082ZROO,My Husband and I were both very pleased with the quality of this DVD. It brought back memories of when we were children growing up with this series. We both  sat together along with our son of 16 and enjoyed watching it once again. Thank you for the availabiltie of this DVD.

2257120,3,B00082ZROO,"I'm sure I'm not the first to say that ""Sky King"" doesn't live up to my remembrance of it as a kid. There may not be a more annoying character then ""niece Penny"" and the stories are pretty lame but the Cessna that King flies is still a cool plane for aviation buffs.",1170720000,3,266,4.037735849056604

2257124,5,B00082ZROO,"This is great. As a baby boomer I remember watching this every saturday morning along with The Lone Ranger, and Fury. Today's jaded kids would find it a bore. It takes alot to stimulate today's younger generation. But in a more inocent time (when going out for a hot dog or ice-cream was a big deal) Sky King was was up there as a top kids show. I plan on buying the whole series.",1137110400,99,380,4.148648648648648
2257125,5,B00082ZROO,"I can't imagine a single baby-boomer that didn't love this series as a child.  I can only remember watching it on Saturday mornings but what a treat!  For the moment I seem to recall two episodes.  The one with a ""haunted house with a screaming woman"" (Sky found a hidden speaker under a table) and an episode where a Native American tribe was in need of rain and Sky King used good ole Songbird to 'seed' the clouds.

Oh, the memories and to have the whole set.  Well this DVD is a start.  I'll roll the dice as the price is nice!",1118448000,94,531,4.1568627450980395

2257137,4,B00082ZROO,"This is the old faithful western that fired me up and inspired me when I was a child.  And even though I had not seen it since I was about 6 years old, it stuck with me.  I was remembering it a lot lately, that is how much it stuck with me. Kirby Grant, the Cessna 310 flying cowboy and his sweetheart niece, Gloria Winters, probably had something to do with me going into aviation.  That is how much this sticks with you.  Watch them.  Give them a chance, and they will penetrate into your soul and influence you to be a better even in this more complex day and age.  They will inspire you to be a more forthright, and more adventure-loving person.  The only reason I did not award this five stars is that the production and direction of this low-budget series does not match up to modern standards.  But even there, they performed camera affects and stunts that were unprecedented in their time.

2257151,1,B00082ZROO,The DVD inside has nothing to do with Sky King. Instead it was a 50 year old documentary about trains. Total rip off. If it wasn't so cheap I'd return it.  Instead I just threw it away. Too bad as I really wanted to relive one of my childhood heroes. Probably one of the reasons I became a private pilot was this show. I've always loved airplanes and still do. But don't waste your time or money on this company.,1438214400,,412,4.15

A bachelor rancher in the fictional western town of Grover, Arizona rides a Cessna 310-B, instead of a horse.  He lives with his niece, Penny, who is also a skilled pilot and he's deputized to assist the county sheriff (Mitch Hargrove, played by Ewing Mitchell), which he does on numerous occasions.  His fictional ranch is probably as large as ""The Ponderosa,"" and requires an airplane, just to view all of it and ""mark"" certain areas (from the air) with bags of lime dust (for fence line placement, as one example).

Each episode features a new problem that requires his taking to the air, to combat ""the bad guys.""

Watching Sky fly the Cessna 310B on TV was what inspired me to get my pilot license as soon as I was old enough (which was 16). These are good, clean and entertaining episodes. There is much more humanitarianism as compared to the stuff they are putting on TV today for kids. The good guy wins. Values mean something. Cheaters are not winners.

Seeing this reminded me of a Civil Air Patrol fly-in many years ago where Sky King (Kirby Grant) flew in in the ""Songbird"".  The fly-in was also attended by the Bell helicopter team from the ""whirlybirds"" TV show.  What a thrill for a boy at 7 years old.

Of course the quilt didn't get done for Christmas, so I wrote him a note that said he could watch the Sky King series until the quilt is done. The family watched all four shows on Christmas Eve. It was a fun trip back for my husband and me,  and the 'young ens' got a kick out of how corny (and innocent) television was way back when.",1356566400,,509,3.8476190476190477

2257214,5,B00082ZROO,"One of my all-time favorite shows growing up in the 1950's and the early 1960's was ""Sky King."" It didn't seem like Saturday without following the adventures of Kirby Grant as Arizona rancher Schuyler ""Sky"" King in his twin-engine Cessna 310-B, the coolest airplane on television.

""Sky King"" could have become a forgotten television Western among the multitude of Westerns had it not been for the talents of one amazing actor named Gloria Winters.  She starred as Sky's petite, spunky, blonde niece Penny King. Gloria appeared in all 72 episodes of ""Sky King"" from 1952-1959, and played a major role in the show becoming the cult favorite that it is today.

Unfortunately, there are only four episodes of ""Sky King"" that are in the public domain, and all of those episodes can be found in this nicely-designed Alpha Video collection. These same four episodes can also be found in other DVD budget sets, but this Alpha collection is one of the best.

The four public domain episodes all feature Penny in key roles in each story. They are:

1. ""Sky Robbers:""  After a robbery, Penny spots a man throwing a heavy sack into a plane just minutes before it takes off in an air race;

2. ""A Dog Named Barney:""  Penny and her Uncle Sky help young Johnny find his seeing-eye dog after it mysteriously disappears;

3. ""Bullet Bait:""  Penny and Sky host a wedding at their Flying Crown Ranch, but the groom fails to show up for the wedding;

4. ""Wild Man:""  Penny befriends a notorious bearded loner who lives in a remote forest area, and who often interferes with loggers who try to cut down trees.

And if you are interested in seeing Gloria Winters in some of her other TV roles during the Golden Age of Television, she can be found in a number of other affordable DVD collections from Amazon. Here's just a few:

1. ""The Life of Riley:""  Eighteen-year-old Gloria Winters played daughter Babs Riley in this 1949-1950 TV sitcom. She appeared in 17 of the 26 episodes that starred Jackie Gleason as TV's first Chester A. Riley, a long-suffering blue-collar worker. Available on DVD from TGG Direct;

2. ""The Gene Autry Show:""  Gloria appeared in a 1951 second season episode entitled ""Warning! Danger!""  She  plays Sue Miller, the younger sister of Dickie Jones (who later played Buffalo Bill, Jr.). Dickie is on the run from a gang of outlaws. Available in the DVD set ""The Gene Autry Show, Complete Season Two"" by Timeless Media Group;

3. ""The Roy Rogers Show:"" Gloria plays Laraine Dunlap in this 1952 episode entitled ""The Hermit's Secret."" She is the daughter of an old rancher trying to hide his dark past. Available in the DVD collection ""Western TV Treasures (150 Television Classics)"" by Mill Creek Entertainment;

4. ""Stories of the Century:""  Gloria is excellent in the lead role of the real-life female outlaw Jennie Stevens McCall known as ""Little Britches"" because she dressed in men's clothes. This episode from 1954 is available in ""Western TV Classics (150 Episodes)"" by Mill Creek, also in a ""Stories of the Century"" collection by St. Clair Video, and other sources;

5. ""Richard Diamond, Private Detective:""  Gloria plays Jane Thomas, a showgirl who helps Diamond locate his old army buddy who has turned killer. This 1957 episode entitled ""Merry-Go-Round Case"" is available in ""Best of TV Detectives (150 Episodes)""  by Mill Creek;

6. ""Frontier Doctor:""  Gloria is a waitress in an oil town cafe who crosses paths with series star Rex Allen when he discovers that his old college friend has died mysteriously. This 1959 episode entitled ""Flaming Gold"" is available in ""Western TV Classics (150 Episodes)"" by Mill Creek.

Gloria Winters left us in 2010, but she lives on in her film work and will continue to entertain her many fans for generations to come.",1347062400,5,3769,4.8286604361370715
2257215,5,B00082ZROO,"This was another great TV show from the 50's. It was so enjoyable to watch.  It brought back a lot of memories like SONGBIRD, THE FLYING CROWN RANCH and Penny. This TV show also influenced me later in my life. Back in 1984, I received my private pilot's license.

Good, wholesome entertainment that did not preach nor did it have any political theme to it. Just adventures in the clear, blue Western skies. I'm not done with these. I'm getting Vol. 2.

2257217,1,B00082ZROO,"The Wild Man, Sky Robbers, A Dog Named Barney and Bullet Bait are the same four episodes available on another DVD released commercially. Sadly, Alpha Video chose to take their prints and use it for their own. Alpha has a reputation for doing this, grabbing prints and films from other DVDs and then putting them out on their labels, with alterations such as superimposing their logo in the corner and freeze framing title cards. You can buy all 72 episodes on a multi-disc set, officially, licensed product on Amazon.com and get BETTER quality.",1327363200,10,544,4.860215053763441
2257218,4,B00082ZROO,"There are 72 Sky King episodes, 4 of which are in the public domain. The public domain episodes are The Wild Man, Sky Robbers, A Dog Named Barney, and Bullet Bait. Those episodes are included on this disc. They are the same episodes included on the Sky King, Vol 1 disc issued by Critic's Choice and offered elsewhere on Amazon. The rights to episodes that are not in the public domain are owned by Flying Crown Enterprises and are offered as a complete set elsewhere on Amazon.

If you are a Sky King fan, as I am from my youth, you will enjoy these four episodes, but will likely want more at some point, if you can afford the cost of the complete set. I watched these four episodes a few times, held out for a few months, then could not wait any longer, finally ordering the complete series.

Even though the plots are a little hokey it's great to watch this series and others of the era because they are still better than  the trash on television today.

I read somewhere that the Sky King show inspired many youngsters to eventually obtain their pilot licenses.  It was a good clean show helping to prove that right is right and wrong is wrong to the young veiwers.

I recommend this DVD and would like to see the rest of the series made available.",1243641600,7,599,4.458715596330276

2257232,4,B00082ZROO,"As a kid in the 60's with only three channels of rabbit ear television to watch,catching a rerun of Sky King on a Saturday was like heaven.  The show seemed terribly exciting then and combined all the elements a child of that era could want.  It was like a crime drama, a western, and an action adventure show all rolled into one.
  This offering is four episodes over an undetermined run of the series. I suppose these are episodes that have been allowed to lapse into public domain. There is more than one version of the opening of the show one of which looks like an old rotary engined beechcraft.  The quality was quite watchable for showes of this vintage.  My only regret is these are only four episodes (which seem to be the only ones in circulation at this time) Buyer beware if you find another sky king DVD it will probably be the same ones. Hopefully more of this great old show will become available in the near future.  A bonus in this DVD is an old Nabisco commercial before one the episodes.",1226448000,4,1006,4.405405405405405
