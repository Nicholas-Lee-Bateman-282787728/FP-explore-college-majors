811786,3,6304216254,"Michel Negroponte, the director of this documentary, wanders into Central Park and encounters Maggie, a whimsical magical creature, who may be in contact with a real alternate universe made up of Roman and other mythological creatures and stories. Kind of like the reality Mr. Negroponte initially projects onto the park: idylllic, beautiful, mythological. Throughout the film we get to know Maggie, as the director inserts himself into her life and tries to ""help"" her: because Maggie is a charming, intelligent, mentally ill homeless woman. Maggie is interesting and we are glad to get to know and gain some understanding of her plight, as most of us usually do not get a chance to do with the mentally ill or the homeless. But, I question Mr. Negroponte's honesty and purpose in this piece. Why is it that he chose to highlight his naive (ignorant?) desire to help her rather than more on Maggie herself? Or more on the homeless and/or mentally ill in the park? Why did he choose to depict this woman as ethereal and happy as he begins his film, when mental illness and homelessness are really such tragic and often hopeless social and personal problems? Or is this piece really about the privileged filmaker finding a quaint subject to use for his art project and becoming disillusioned by what is actually a tragic reailty? Poor guy.",1114992000,11,1338,4.87280701754386
811787,2,6304216254,"First off, let me apologize for only watching half the film before writing this review.  For a while I thought...maybe it will change, maybe the end will redeem the beginning.  Then I couldn't take it anymore.  Maggie's story is interesting, intriguing, and portrayed in a respectful manner.  The filmmaker is clearly truly interested in and affected by her and her story.  But his flat voice interrupts all too frequently to give no further insight or commentary than blunty stating his growing interest.  If there were more her, I think I would have been much more interested in it.  As it is, I felt that the parts that showed her, rather than guiding and teaching us about her, illustrated his monotonous voice.",1030579200,11,715,4.859504132231405
811788,5,6304216254,"You could walk by Maggie Kogan without ever knowing that she was tuned into things from which you would not be able to make any sort of immediate sense.  If you talked to her, you would probably get the impression that she was crazy.  If you had a few psychology courses as an undergrad, you might see strains of schizophrenia with hints of disassociation and grandeur.  But if you spent enough time with her, her world might poke through your conventional conception, and start to gain meaning.
The director of this documentary found a walking embodiment of personal mythology in a homeless woman in Central Park.  Through research and interviewing, he proceeds to unravel a translation of Maggie Kogan that coalesces during the passing of the film.  The director's approach makes the film special. A psychoanalyst might find contextual cues that would allow him to confront Maggie on an emotional level.  Unfortunately this might risk a ""psychotic"" break in Maggie's sense of what we commonly recognize as reality.  Thankfully, the director uses a much more subtle and non-judgmental approach.  As we learn more about Maggie's past, and begin to understand her signifiers, we experience a fully realized and unique individual.  The directorial tone allows the viewer to go beyond labels, and truly glimpse the totality of individual perception and reality.  It's a rare opportunity in American film.
If you enjoy this, I recommend another documentary about a genuine NYC shining star- ""The Cruise"" featuring Timothy ""Speed"" Levitch--- a double-decker bus tour guide.",1030060800,9,1568,5.186507936507937

811791,5,6304216254,"I rarely watch anything twice, but after seeing this film, the story stayed in my mind for a long time and I've watched  it again from time to time to fit all the pieces and, more importantly, not to forget.  To see  how circumstances can change one's life forever and how one copes with  things that are too painful to acknowlege is what struck me about this  film. It is a tragic film as to what might have been and one can't help but  love Maggie with her lyrical speech and laughing  manner which mask what  lies underneath which  even she herself can't bear to remember.",951177600,15,575,4.349056603773585
811903,4,6304216254,"As we pass the homeless on the street, we should remember the circumstances of this woman. Mental health problems are slow to be diagnosed and even harder to get the patient to be compliant. This woman could be any on of our relatives or even ourselves when the drugs don't work or the wrong ones prescribed or family just gets tired of dealing with the ups and downs of living with someone with mental illness. I pray she is warm and safe this very cold day, if she is still living. An excellent movie for teens to watch too.",1388707200,,526,4.3232323232323235
811904,3,6304216254,Watching this film was a little like watching a train wreck. It also reiterated that homeless people are often homeless for a reason. LSD? Schizophrenia? I wanted to go hug my kid and pray to the fates this never happens to her.,1387929600,,228,4.4523809523809526
811905,1,6304216254,"Disappointing.  Maybe I've spent more time than the average bear with the mental illness crowd (I'm an RN), but the filmmaker seemd like someone who'd never met a schizophrenic before, had some film grant money going, and made this flick.  He also seemed to romanticize her her illness too much ( he even admits this), especially in the first half of the film.  Also, some films have a more timeless quality, but this one, at 19 years out, seems dated.

If you have some time to kill, ( or need a NYC fix) you could do worse, but that's about it.",1386806400,,546,4.376237623762377

811960,4,6304216254,"I enjoyed the movie. At the same time, I wondered to myself if this was enough of a subject to surround with a film. There are lots of ""lost souls"" that live in parks and the street. Does each of them possess enough compelling substance to capture our attention for 90+minutes? Or are they more disoriented folks who live in survival mode a bit more openly because the lack the shelter the rest of us have. I'm not sure. I mean she was interesting; but her thoughts are jumbled and the theories she proscribes are obviously psychotic. It looses the foundation of truth, therefore.

811961,5,6304216254,"This documentary introduces us to Maggie a lady of middle years living in Manhattan's Central Park with a pack of stray dogs she has made in to a family of sorts.  The filmmaker, Michel Negroponte, met Maggie by chance in the park and was entranced by her beguiling personality and cryptic statements that seem to show both madness and wisdom.  Maggie is a mysterious character and Negroponte is able to solve some of the mystery of her earlier life through a bit of research that surprisingly uncovers  tapes of different appearances she made on national television as a young woman in her career as  one of the first female horse carriage driver/tour guides in New York City.  Maggie has affluent friends (including the film's producer Negroponte) who help her with her life but there is no fairy tale  ending to the story.  This is a poignant well made documentary of particular interest to those with a love of New York City and/or an interest in those with mental health differences.",1184457600,13,988,4.776470588235294
811962,5,6304216254,"C. G. Jung once had a patient who believed she lived on the moon. So Jung met her there. As she realized he took her experiences as valid, she told a sad tale of vampires and isolation. Eventually, this woman who'd been abused as a girl made her way back to earth. Patients like her had taught Jung that the fact of a person's madness did not in any way invalidate the richness and authenticity of their personal mythology.

It would be easy to dismiss--to ""shrink""--Maggie Cogan's inner world. Having been homeless in Central Park, she clearly displays the classic symptoms of schizophrenia. She is one of thousands and thousands of women in the U.S. left without adequate health care or even the means to support themselves. As her story gradually emerges, the trained watcher wonders whether her schizophrenic predisposition would have manifested so floridly had she not been subjected to the events described in this film. As a result, she believes she is Hera, wife of Zeus, or in Roman terms, Juno, the wife of Jupiter. She wears a radio strapped to her head so she can be ""on the airwaves"" tuned in to what's happening. (She finds New York gridlock amusing and avoids it.) The filmmaker decided to listen in and, at one point, not only investigate her past, but contact social services personnel to get her some help. Unfortunately, they showed up with sledgehammers and knocked down her shed. No squatters allowed, even in a New York winter.

When I show this film to graduate students I suggest that they hold it on at least two levels simultaneously--the needless tragedy of this homeless woman's life, and the mythological dimension that surrounds it like an aura--without reducing one to the other and thereby falling into either the shrinkage of reductionism or the romanticization of mental illness. Maggie Cogan is a person with a story to tell, a survivor, an inspiration, and a face of reality behind all the political jingoism to justify spending billions on weapons while Americans starve. She is also a parable. In ancient times storytellers and listeners knew the world remained in balance so long as Jupiter and Juno remained in relations of mutual empowerment. But today, as the plutocracy consumes the planet surface (""plutocracy"" from Pluto, god of death and wealth), Jupiter has lost his throne to President Mars, the family in all its versions is on the brink of bankruptcy, and Hera is no longer the Queen of Heaven, maternal image of feminine authority. She lives on relief in New Jersey, where she looks after her puppies, goes without medication, and listens in on the pulse of the times without losing her dignity or her sense of the ironic.",1170115200,53,2673,4.859649122807017
811963,5,6304216254,"Is it schizophrenia, or just a well-developed personal mythology?  Or perhaps even a fate predestined in ancient times, the ""romantic conversation"" of a woman who has determined to devote her time and energy to maintaining the strength of her million-year-long marriage to the god Jupiter.

In ""Jupiter's Wife,"" Michel Negroponte introduces us to Maggie, a homeless woman who spends her days wandering through Central Park, surrounded by her dogs, amused by her radio and drawing comfort from her belief that extra-sensory perception allows her to anticipate and understand what is happening in her world.

Negroponte's portrayal of Maggie and her life is free of the kinds of judgments or pathos that one might expect in a film about a schizophrenic.

When Maggie is compelled to submit to a psychiatric exam in order to qualify for a rent subsidy, Negroponte shows us Maggie's version of the interview and allows us to share her relief and amusement that an event so intrusive and potentially threatening to her self-image turns out to be so perfunctory and impersonal.

The filmmaker's affection for his subject creates for the viewer an atmosphere of respect and a suspension of disbelief.  We begin to see this mentally ill individually from an entirely new perspective.  What if she's not crazy?  Maybe this is a person who has simply constructed a sensible world for herself that doesn't make sense to anyone else.  When Negroponte asks Maggie to explain what ESP is and how it works, she says it is a ""finely tuned understanding of other people and what they want and how they can achieve their goals relative to your goals so we can all just move this everlasting peace grid just down that much closer to earth so that there's peace.""

Poets and songwriters have said stranger things.

""Jupiter's Wife"" succeeds in challenging our preconceptions about homelessness and mental illness, and encourages us to remember that there is a complex and valuable human being beneath the apparent craziness.  Let us hope that this fresh insight comes to mind when we encounter those people who are perhaps less beguiling than Maggie, but who are sleeping out on the grates or in doorways or in the great urban parks under ""the everlasting peace grid.""",1146009600,10,2248,4.997319034852547

ESP and the Universal Mind are concepts many Spiritual people espouse as gifts that we all have, it's just whether we choose to tap into this ability. We ALL hear voices, from the child who hears inwardly, 'You're stupid"" to the the middle-aged woman who hears, "" You're now worthless in this society, because only youth and beauty are valued in women in American society."". Maggie's voices aren't acceptable to the general public, and too far out there, so she is schizophrenic. Maybe not by LA standards, but she's coped the best way possible for her. This is a mental health label we would all gladly put on her as we would avoid her and her menagerie upon encountering her. Maggie's good-hearted nature, ready smile, and authentic loving will open the hearts of many viewers. This is not a weird or depressing documentary. She wants peace for the world, and that is the sign of a big-hearted soul who cares for others....this isn't the definition of ""crazy"" in any language. Kudos also to the people who befriended her with yoga, massages, animal care, and government aid. Mixing fact and fantasy, she even brought forward a wonderful friend from the Upper East Side....showing what loving and a good attitude can accomplish..the improbable if not the impossible. In this day and age we are all riding close to the edge of where she has been and where she is now. She proves one's station in life is not the end of the world.
