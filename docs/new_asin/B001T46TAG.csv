3788070,5,B001T46TAG,"This movies was absolutely fantastic. One problem though is the description on amazon is pretty far off of what was actually happening.
Here is the IMDB description:

The sound engineer Charlotte returns from Paris to her hometown in the countryside after the death of her mother, a clairvoyant card-reader murdered in her cottage. In the opinion of the police, the killer was one of her acquaintances as the house was not broken into. Charlotte feels hostility from her neighbors and decides to bug their house using her sound equipment. However she finds that inside her mother's house, there is a connection with the past and she can hear what happened there. Charlotte investigates the leads and discovers the truth about the death of her mother.",1436227200,4,750,5.0
3788071,5,B001T46TAG,"Maybe not a pure five stars, but I gave it an extra one since it's very original, the acting is wonderful, and the cinematography very effective.  As a mystery, it could have offered more to the viewer, but that's my only complaint.",1393027200,,232,4.523809523809524
3788072,4,B001T46TAG,"Moody, intriguing whodunnit that almost doesn't feel like a whodunnit cuz there's hardly any questioning of suspects. Instead, the backstory is revealed thru a scifi device -- the daughter of the murdered woman is a sound engineer who happens to plug in her equipment at the cottage her mother was murdered in -- and hears sounds and voices from the past. Naturally, it leads to the killer. Red herrings misled me and I was fooled. And everything comes together nicely at the end.

I suppose the timetraveling sounds were too readily accepted. And I would think it would be difficult to figure out so clearly what was going on based just on sounds. If you're not the suggestible type, you might dwell on these and not be able to lose yourself in the story the way I did.

For me, there's much that shines in this gloomy film. Structure. Dialog. Acting, altho I was unfamiliar with all the actors. Visuals. Pacing. If there was background music, I didn't notice (ie, it didn't get in the way).",1306281600,6,992,4.630681818181818
3788073,2,B001T46TAG,"Alant Kavait's Ecoute le Temps is an interesting idea (albeit one not a million miles from White Noise) that never develops into a particularly interesting film. Following the murder of her fortune telling mother, milie Dequenne's sound recordist travels to the decaying cottage where she was killed and - luckily having brought her sound equipment with her - after a few uninvolving and underdeveloped encounters with the locals, not only finds her mother's voice on recordings of the creaking house but discovers that by placing the microphone in different parts of the house she can eavesdrop on different parts of her past. As she struggles to build a literal timeline of the recordings so she can isolate the moment of the killing, the film should start to build up some momentum and tension, but the film remains for the most part stuck in its position as disinterested observer, the secrets she gradually uncovers - like the brief glimpses of her troubled relationship with her mother or the local disputes between organic farmers and the local chemical fertilizer magnate - rather underwhelming and underdeveloped, emotionally and viscerally.

While it does capture the cold oppressiveness of many rural communities, unfortunately for a film that revolves around sound, the film doesn't trust sound's ability to create atmosphere, never using it particularly interestingly in an unadventurous sound mix and often flattening it altogether with musique concrete scoring. Nor is there any mystery in the recordings, which are dutifully conveyed largely as flashbacks: it's almost as if Coppola decided The Conversation would be so much better if you could understand every word from the start. There's no ambiguity in its soundscape, no questioning of the senses from its heroine - what you hear and see is what you get. As a result, you have a leading character whose job is recording wildtrack sound for atmosphere in a film that has a tough time drawing much atmosphere from its premise, let alone thrilling or chilling in the process, and one where you can't help feeling that for once a remake could actually improve upon significantly.",1284940800,7,2146,5.148997134670487
8340472,4,B001T46TAG,"Pace is slow, but helps to define the characters realization that she has the inherent sensitivities of her mother, recently deceased, to know things about people and their past deeds.",1473033600,,184,5.166666666666667
8340473,4,B001T46TAG,"Think of a time when you were watching a particular movie, but you only realized that you were watching the movie, once you came to. Somewhere along the line the movie placed you in a hypnotic state. It didn't bore you or make you sleepy, it just sort of took you someplace else for a bit. This is one of those types of movies.",1465776000,,327,4.125
8340474,5,B001T46TAG,Loved this - very understated - quiet but tense - a hybrid of a psychological thriller and a classic French movie about relationships where not much seems to be happening but there is really a lot happening between the lines - full of complexity and pathos.,1465603200,,257,4.608695652173913
8340475,3,B001T46TAG,"A decent movie, especially considering that there is not a big selection of Amazon Prime French films. However, it's nothing like the description given. It's actually a sort of murder/mystery, in which a daughter gradually uncovers the secret of her mother's murder. Her mother was a clairvoyant (""village witch""), and there are supernatural elements in the plot. Most of the film is centered on the suspense of finding out what happened.",1461888000,,438,5.183098591549296

8340479,5,B001T46TAG,"Very good French suspense film. Wonderful cinematography, wonderful acting, interesting story line/premise, some well staged plot twists and a continuous barrage of suspense and denouement as per classic french cinema noir. milie Dequenne performs brilliantly! There's a haunting dreariness that is eloquently expressed throughout the course of the film. It reminds me of my year of study abroad in France (during the off seasons when the weather wasn't quite uplifting). I adore great Canal+ films, some of the best in the world.",1448928000,,530,5.475609756097561
