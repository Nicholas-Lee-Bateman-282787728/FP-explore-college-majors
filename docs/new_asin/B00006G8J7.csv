After ""Married with children..."" and ""Seinfeld"" MITM soon became my all-time-favorite. I hope this DVD boxed set soon will be released in Germany, too. I just can't wait to see Lois freaking out when she discovers her burned red dress, or Malcolm taking part in Hal's skating lessons, Dewey spending time with Bea Arthur (Golden Girls) or Malcolm pulling Reese's shorts off at the water park!! ;) You have to buy this DVD set!!

1755047,5,B00006G8J7,"Malcolm in the Middle is one of the best and funniest sitcoms ever on TV.  I only want to add my voice to that of others who wonder why the dvd of the complete seasons of this series is still not yet available in the U.S.  Regions 2 and 4 have been available for years.  Malcolm may still be in syndication in the U.S., but that's no reason to hold the complete series hostage for those who would like to have the whole shebang on dvd.  It never ceases to amaze me that so often, for whatever reasons, release of some TV series are held up.  These kinds of delays only frustrate us buyers and further, it hurts sales because, by the time a series IS released, no one cares anymore!  This fiasco happened with The Wonder Years and the Happy Days series (why have only six seasons been released so far?).  I don't understand it, but I sure hope more of the really decent TV series would get out on dvd more expeditiously and Malcolm in the Middle is one of them.",1499731200,5,960,4.213114754098361
1755048,2,B00006G8J7,"The purpose of this show is to push feminism aka feminazism and to make rank criminality ""cool"" and ""funny"". There couldn't be a more screwed up bunch of kids and parents apart from grisly murderers etc These parents are all too familiar in todays decayed pagan society and this show glorifies them by using warped comedic devices of them. The mother is some arrogant all powerful bully that everyone must listen to and fear amid her shrieking and yelling and frankly disgusting behavior and the father is a infantile sex maniac that presents a feeble vision of a man. This seems to be Bryan Cranstons forte, warped family shows that feature vile actions, see Breaking Bad a show about a teacher and father who uses his chemistry skills to make drugs! Cranston also played LBJ, a major criminal, in the ""all the way"" movie, a blatant sexual reference both in the 60s and now, so more glorifying perversion. Making criminality and the unnatural feminism into good and funny things is disgusting and this show among MANY does such a thing. What you laugh at you seek to emulate and the braying audience will do so. You want to know a big reason why things are so screwed up in the world? Well look at what is considered ""funny"" and pushed onto simple minded boobs who gobble it up.

The children in this show are simply criminals who can't control themselves and don't really try unless the all powerful feminazi has a figurative sword of Damocles held over their head. So this is almost a prison show really. There is time and time again blatant lack of morals or even decency not to mention self respect by these kids. This is the parents negligent and frankly pagan values at work. The frequent ""smart"" ""genius"" in Malcolm we are shown and use thereof is typical of the amoral and legalistic ""geniuses"" we are fed as heroes in all professions today. These are schemers and criminals presented as heroes nothing more. The disgusting insect like behavior is degrading to watch and those who find this stuff funny are truly lost. Take this trash out for good.",1498176000,,2057,4.666666666666667
1755049,4,B00006G8J7,"Many TV historians will tell you that if it wasn't wedged in between the Simpsons and the X-Files on FOX Sunday nights, Malcolm In The Middle never would have lasted seven seasons. The ratings did drop every time Fox tried to move the show, and it did ultimately get cancelled when Family Guy came back and took it's time slot. I think however, it had more to do with the kids growing up than it did with the quality of the show or it's time slot, because Malcolm In The Middle to me, was the first truly hilarious and worthwhile sitcom of the new millennium.

The family with no last name, (yes, in seven seasons, they don't mention their last name a single time) is the dysfunctional family that puts all others to shame! The father, Hal (Bryan Cranston), may be the biggest kid of them all, with absolutely no self-control. The mother, Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), is the boss, the big scary scream machine, who hands out the punishments, and is the boys ultimate rival, making her the most fun to mess with. The oldest son, Francis (Christopher Masterson), is so bad, that he keeps getting sent away to one ridiculous place after another. The next oldest, Reese (Justin Berfield), is the good old fashion school bully. Little brother, Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan) is just as weird as they come (every time he screamed like a girl, especially when he got older, I almost peed myself). Finally, in the middle is Malcolm (Frankie Muniz), who is a genius, trying to make sense of the chaos that is his life.

To me this show was so ahead of it's time, I mean they cast Bryan Cranston in a leading role, back when Vince Gilligan was still a part-time screen writer on the X-Files. The chemistry between the kids is fantastic and the dynamic between the laid back Hal and the high struck Lois is comedic gold. This isn't just the kind of show you love to watch, but it's also the kind of show you can tell the people involved with loved doing it. When it's more than just a job and the actors really love the characters and fellow cast members, that is when a show can become really special.

The bottom line, most sitcoms are full of corny PG jokes meant for prime time audiences. They're something to tune into when nothing else is on, but once in a while, one of them comes along that is special and breaks the mold, Malcolm In The Middle is that show. No sitcom, with perhaps the exception of Everybody Loves Raymond has ever made me laugh as much as this show has, and trust me that is not an easy task with my weird sense of humor.",1497312000,,2526,4.416309012875536

1755066,5,B00006G8J7,"I remember when I got back from living overseas and my dad told me, you've got to watch this show.  When an episode aired and I got the opportunity to see it I was instantly hooked, it was funny and clever and Lois was just like my mother was growing up.  I could relate to this show like no other family set sitcom before.  It's great that you can now obtain this show in season collections and watch it from the start (I started a few in when it was airing fresh on TV).  Season 1 starts off with Malcolm already struggling to cope on the social school scene, when the teacher of the smart class who has been talking to his teacher decides to assess him.  Too distracted by the fact he has paint on his behind to work out he should intentionally play down his answers he ends up amongst the Kreylboynes (no idea if that is spelt right) and it's apparent he's smarter than everyone in that class by a long way.  This of course makes life at school so much harder, especially impressing the cute blonde girl in former class he's had a crush on.  At home his brothers Reece and Dewey battle each other and of course their mother who isn't afraid to yell at or punish her boys to keep them on track to their potential.  Meanwhile their older brother Francis is coping with military school where he of course has to test the system and clash with the commandant.  His life long war against his mother up to then will both hinder and hamper his time there.

Season 1 ends with the to be continued episode at the water park where Dewey is also chasing a paper bag after a balloon popped. Before that we have iconic episodes such as the killer robot project where Hal lives without Lois for a few days and reverts back to his former self, Lois getting fired from the supermarket due to Dewey's theft, Francis finding a dead body when he's stolen the school's skeleton key, the Krelyboyne talent show picnic, Lois bedridden and the boys taking advantage of the fact she still thinks its Sunday to skip school than realising they can't do anything fun, and Hal teaching Malcolm to roller-skate.

There's also some great extras where we learn about how the concept of the show came about through Linwood Boomer (and that Malcolm is a version of him from his childhood).  We learn the usual story of successful TV shows that are different to the norm and the hurdles to get the show on the air, such as the test audiences wanting the characters to be different, such as Lois to tell her kids she loves them and them to reply the same at some time each episode.  There's also a nice look at the actor who plays Dewey's life when he returns each year from LA to help his family with their restaurant and play spit ball with his cousins.  There's your bloopers, deleted scenes, alternative skits before the opening credits that were never used, interviews with the cast where they are grateful for the opportunity especially Bryan Cranston and Jane Kaczmarek who hadn't had a regular gig throughout their lengthy careers up to then, and many other interesting features further the value for money of this first season.",1435190400,,3105,4.472566371681416

1755082,5,B00006G8J7,"I'm a diehard Malcolm fan, even though the show has long been over after season 7.
Key highlights: Malcolm is a genius prodigy with a dysfunctional family at his side. It's a show most American families can relate to, as it is a comedy stripped of sentimentality and the usual warm fuzzies of previous TV comedies from 20-30 years ago. Also, the lack of a canned laugh track makes for a much better platform in which you are to laugh whenever you feel like it...and there are many laghs to be gleaned from MITM! It's earthy, crude and rude humor at times (but not R-rated crude like American Pie and other frathouse flicks ) It's the nitty-gritty of daily living we can all relate to as middle class suburban Americans. Malcolm ""breaks the fourth wall"" and talks directly to the camera/audience at times, which is endearing in a quirky, quizzical way.
Lois, the matriarch, June Cleaver she ain't...she is the Boss who rules over a household of four boys and adult man spouse like General Patton. Oldest son, Francis is in a military academy...the dynamics of controlling mother/rebellious son achieve quite a few belly laughs, Malcolm is the gifted child with the genius IQ who's caught up in growing pains and trying to fit in, and survive life with older brother Reese, a dimwitted thug and the playground uber-bully, and little brother Dewey, who has a talent at times for outwitting Malcolm and Reese in their shenanigans. Hal, the dad is caught between nature vs. nurture; he worships Lois but you can tell he fears her wrath at times and acquiesces to her demands.
This is a must have for all fans of the show...now if there were just a way to get seasons 2, 3, 4, etc. individually? Special guest Bea Arthur of the Golden Girls playing the babysitter in the final episode (#16-""Water Park"" ) I think.

In spite of its six year run, the parents on this show I find are no better as role models than the parents on ROSEANNE; especially the mother, who obviously doesn't love her sons.

Malcolm is a boy who is diagnosed as a genius and put into a ""special class"" for the gifted and talented at school.  He is a very smart boy who provides the insight and vision for this show.  The character narrates the episodes and we generally see his family and school through his eyes though not exclusively.  The family consists of parents and 4 boys whom the mother tries to keep under as much control as possible.  The oldest son has gotten into trouble and has been sent off to Alabama to attend a strict military boys school.  The next child is a boy who is destructive for no apparent reason and can't explain why, he says that he doesn't know why he does what he does but knows he doesn't want to get caught.  Malcolm is the 3rd boy and Dewey is the youngest, a boy that is influenced by TV commercials and easily led by his older brothers into troublesome tasks.  The father is half man, half boy and acts as a friend to his sons and only occasionally as a parent.  The main theme of the show seems to be American male development from the early years through to adulthood.  The mother functions as a moderating force among all the male characters.  A funny show.",1348099200,,1249,4.272340425531915
1755176,5,B00006G8J7,"if you are like me, you have been watching bryan cranston play walt on breaking bad for four seasons.  he has swept up a mantle full of emmy awards while doing so.  it is one of the darkest roles ever written about a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a crystal meth producer. i had never seen him in anything else so watched this series for which he is equally well known.  He plays Hal the father.

Much to my astonishment, Cranston is capable of playing a delightful and beloved comic character.  He is Hal, the hapless but loving father in a fiercely matriarchal family of boys led by his wife Lois. They have four sons when we open and these sons are capable of the worst mischief at home or in school.  They are the scourge of the neighborhood and the school. The show is narrated by Malcolm who is the middle child, who is also a boy genius albeit as incorrigible as the rest.

I just finished watching all seven seasons of this on netflix instant viewing and had a wonderful time doing so.  The entire show is a comedic masterpiece. I highly recommend it.

Well, a DVD company in the UK has bought the rights from FOX and due to the less complicated copyright issues in the UK all 7 seasons will be released one per month starting in April over the coming year.

The first season is out April 16th 2012 and you can import it from Amazon UK. If you've already got it take a second thought as all the seasons are being released in widescreen!! The second season will be presumably released May 14th if you wanna pick up from there and a Complete Collection will be released in the months leading up to Christmas.

Other great news is that the original music will be present on all the sets and not replaced with soundalikes!

Bryan Cranston's roller skating dancing scene is just wondeful such effortless and poise on a disco track.these three songs feature ""Enjoy Yourself"" by The Jacksons (Skating Lesson #2) and ""I'm Your Boogieman"" by KC & The Sunshine Band (Skating Lesson #3).

Justin Berfield as Malcolm's elder brother is great and funny. His conflict scenes with his mother are worth watching. He looks good his interactions with Malcolm are really amusing,really like him here.

Bea Arthur from ""Golden Girls"" is in a special appearance here as Dewey's Nanny for a day.

Erik Per Sullivan

is Dewey here he is kind of cute and his imagination is interesting and funny too.

Jane Kaczmarek is great as Malcolm's mother most of the engrossing situations develop around her.

Frankie Muniz is great as Malcolm. His talking into the camera to tell his thoughts really work here makes going on more interesting also present his view point of situations.

Christopher Masterson plays the eldest brother who is sent off to military school. He is funny too. Malcolm keeps asking his advice over the phone.",1327968000,,1346,4.847161572052402
1755184,5,B00006G8J7,"This is what a lot of the family comedies are missing today, although Modern Family pulls pretty close to. It's the characters that really shine in this show. Why? Because they are very, very relatable. Now I'm not saying that every family is as crazy as this, although mine certainly is. Everybody, and I mean everybody can relate to both of the boys, Malcolm and Reese. With Malcolm we've always felt like the outsider a little bit and with Reese, well we've always been the wild child at times and the one who gets in trouble, at least I have. And not wanting to dwell on my family too much, but the mother was like a carbon copy of mine. And older brother who's only a year older is identical to Reese. But I don't think your family has to be identical to this one for you to like the show, it just has a general appeal. The acting is superb, and it really makes you believe that these people have been living together and growing up with one another for years. Of course, most of the negative reviews are because only Season One is out on DVD, but people, GET NETFLIX!

1755232,5,B00006G8J7,"I'm as prone as the next Boomer to waxing endlessly nostalgiac about the sixties-seventies TV of my childhood, particularly the great sitcoms of the era... but I have to admit that the past decade and a half or so have produced some truly great new classics, and ""Malcolm in the Middle"" can take its place at or near the top of the list.

This insanely funny family comedy was created by the versatile Linwood Boomer, who as writer-producer made witty contributions to series such as ""Night Court"" and ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" and in his hunky young actor days was once best known as the blind husband of Melissa Sue Anderson on the Michael Landon family drama ""Little House on the Prairie."" ""Malcolm"" is reportedly loosely based on Boomer's own life (!), and in this DVD collection there are so many wonderfully written episodes and memorable moments of expertly executed lunacy--here a sampling of mine:

Pilot Episode: When couch potatoes Malcolm, older brother Reese and little brother Dewey all decline to move to answer the insistently ringing front doorbell their mother, an exasperated--and obviously topless--Lois (who was moments ago trying to locate her bra as she hurriedly dressed for work), flings it open to find a startled school counselor on her doorstep. (A snippet of this moment can be seen in the opening theme montage)

""New Neighbors"" (Season 2): Headstrong eldest son Francis and his fellow military school Cadets, in full dress, are led by their autocratic Commandant Spangler in a hilariously sprightly choral performance of the old Sammy Davis Jr./Mike Curb Congregation pop classic ""Candyman"" in honor of the impending visit of Spangler's hero, Colonel Oliver North.

""Monkey"" (Season 3): An injured and temporarily wheelchair-bound Craig Feldspar (Lois's Lucky Aide co-worker) must be rescued by his ""rival"" Hal when he realizes that the Capuchin helper monkey who had been taking care of his needs has turned on him and is now trying to kill him.

""If Boys Were Girls"": During a trip to the mall a beleagured Lois, now expecting child #5, daydreams that her brawling, battling sons were well-behaved lady-like daughters instead; meanwhile in another part of the mall an increasingly desperate Hal attempts to find the perfect Valentine's gift for Lois--and resorts to repeatedly stealing the bags of another mall shopper to do it; and

""Day Care"" (both Season 4): Now that baby Jamie has arrived Hal and Lois are desperate to find affordable care for him. They discover a neighborhood church offers free day care services to its members, so they pretend to be a Christian family from another town's sister congregation in order to qualify; meanwhile, in a spiritual instruction class, their dimbulb son Reese spies a painting of Elijah being taken up to Heaven by a chariot of fire and is inspired to recreate the holy experience for himself with a lawn chair and a bunch of attached balloons. He (briefly) ascends upward singing a mangled version of ""Amazing Grace"" as Dewey watches in wonder and calls up to him sweetly ""I'll miss you, at first!""

You get the idea. Malcolm finds in his neurotic and hyper-articulate Krelboyne classmates Lloyd and Dabney, and especially his asthmatic, wheel-chair-bound and very droll African-American best friend Stevie (Craig Lamar Traylor is truly affecting with... his... gasping...pauses), another family of sorts, one as amusingly dysfunctional as his own. His dad, Hal, bonds with Stevie's loving, over-protective dad, Abe, joining him in evening poker games with friends (all Gentlemen of Color, whom Hal eventually accuses of looking down on him because he's the only... NON-PROFESSIONAL in the group!) And David Anthony Higgins (who also co-starred in ""Ellen"") steals every single scene he's in as Lucky Aide manager Craig, hopelessly smitten with Lois and prepared to submit to every humiliation--and mean trick at the hands of her scheming boys--to be near her. His panic, in the face of the worker revolt Hal leads against him at Lucky Aide (to the marching beat of Phil Collins's ""Sussudio""), is priceless.

The kids (star Frankie Muniz as the hapless Malcolm, Christopher Masterson as rebellious big brother Francis, Justin Berfield as second oldest idiot-bully Reese, and particularly Erik Per Sullivan as Dewey, the smarter-than-he-looks, sweet oddball kid brother) are all letter perfect in their realistic sibling rivalries, but to me it's the parents who deserve special mention: Jane Kaczmarek is the perfect modern TV mom--harassed, embattled, controlling, perpetually weary, yet loving and fiercely devoted to her wayward family. The scene (cannot at this moment recall the Season or episode; sorry) in which in the midst of a typical battle of wills with the equally stubborn Francis her eyes suddenly fill with tears and she apologizes, acknowledging that when he was little she was not the mother to him she should have been, will put a lump in your throat no matter how many times you see it. And Bryan Cranston is a revelation as the scattered, semi-ineffectual and utterly put-upon husband and father who nevertheless manages to pull himself together and come through for his family in spite of himself; he simply adores the mother of his children, not minding a whit that very possibly he loves her more than she loves him. With his loyalty, basic decency, and moments of gentleness he is the show's beating heart.

In later seasons look for recurrent apppearances from veteran scene-stealers like Cloris Leachman (as Ida, Lois's appalling monster-mom) and Kenneth Mars (as Otto, Francis's sweet-natured German dude-ranch employer), and delightful guest turns from the talented likes of Susan Sarandon, Bea Arthur, Stephen Root and Patrick Warburton, among others.",1242259200,6,5759,5.163987138263666

1755266,5,B00006G8J7,"When Malcolm in the Middle first hit American TV screens it was something that was never seen before, it was a family not of the typical American lot... or are they? They got massive ratings for the first season and rightfully so, it gave is an incredibly funny depiction of real American family life. It's nothing like any other sitcom you've seen, all the characters don't make up at the end and we don't get a message of life shoved in our face. It's simply just funny because a lot of it is so true, yet so bizarre.

The show focuses around middle child genius Malcolm (hence the name) and his dysfunctional family. It chronicles his struggles being the most intelligent person in his family of misfits and his relationship with his mother, father and brothers. From time to time we're treated to Malcolm's monologues, generally him spouting his distaste for how his family are together. Frankie Muniz plays the part well and for the years that the show ran for he managed to keep the character consistent.

The family consist of Lois (the mother) she's crazy, plain and simple. She's the worst mother we could possibly imaging having, she's strict, she's stubborn and worst of all she's always right. Hal (The dad) he's the weakest one of the lot, he's pretty dumb and easily manipulated which the boys are very familiar with. Francis (the oldest brother) he was sent to military school by Lois for simply getting in too much trouble. Being in military school doesn't stop him from being the prankster though. Reece (second oldest) he's an idiot and one of the main reasons why the boys are always in trouble as his usual ""cunning"" schemes never work. Dewey (the youngest) he just stays out of the way and when he does get involved he's the usual annoying little brother.

This is truly an amazing and original sitcom and I was forced to just be general about the show as no further seasons have been released. I'm happy to hear that season 2 may be on the way and hopefully further seasons will follow onto DVD. By far my favourite character has to be Hal, his craziness and quite childish personality make him one of the funniest characters in a sitcom.",1221868800,4,2160,4.634464751958225

1755269,5,B00006G8J7,"I started watching Malcolm in the Middle on TV in Spring of 2007 and instantly fell in love. Once I found out that Fox took it off of its 6:30PM weekday schedule I was just so upset. Enough with the background story, this DVD is great. Malcolm in the Middle is not you average TV show. Each character is lovable in their own way. Lois(the mother) is loud, strict, but I can't get enough of her yelling. Hal (dad) is a loving husband and father of his kids, and he seems to always be trying to find a sanctuary in his mind to escape the daily problems of his kids and his life. Malcolm is not your run of the mill kid, he's 13, has an IQ of 165, moved up to a gifted class, and trying to survive his daily life with his barely functional family. Reese is dumb when it comes to school, but he knows how to intimidate kids to get what he wants, and he also has ideas that he may think are good but usually will lead to a new level of punishment from Lois. Dewey is just a little innocent kid, though that somewhat changes, that is just going with his daily life and has his own unique to deal with his brothers. Francis, the eldest of all the brothers, is pretty much a bad*** for a lack of better words. He got sent to military school by Lois and Hal for all the damage he did, mentally and emotionally. There are other characters, though not as important, still play a big role in this non functional family's life. The bonus features, I found, great because I love interviews and behind the scenes clips.

One of the best moms ever on television, much closer to mom-home than the average american tv mother. This mom gets screaming mad and then loving smiley and then outraged again, all in ten seconds, just like a real mom. She's also hilarious.

1755279,5,B00006G8J7,"I first caught this show in it's final season...in late night reruns.  And, goodness gracious, I was floored by the quality and consistency of the show.  So, when these DVDs went on sale, I had to have them.  And...I was speechless.  Absolutely fabulous.  Easily one of the greatest comedies of all time, and on the short list of best family shows of any kind.

Particularly fantastic was the episode ""Smunday.""  They easily blew through 3 or 4 plot twists, and at the climax of the episode I was literally gasping from horror, laughter and shock.  Hilarious!  Also, the sight gags on this show are funny, slightly exaggeratedly (hence the humor) and always with a touch of tenderness that highlights why family relationships are complex and unique and beautiful, even when their shameless and dysfunctional.  I think the episode ""Malcolm Babysits"" highlights this nicely, when Malcolm in babysitting for the ""ideal"" family, while his family is their own neighborhood's live Jerry Springer show, while camping in a trailer while their house is getting fumigated.  Sure, we know the moral is that there is no place like home, but the lesson isn't forced and is very entertaining.  Far from didactic, you barely notice between the humor.  And the young cast together are astonishingly good actors.  Muniz, in particular, handles his duplicitous ""real-life"" versus talking to the camera with a fluidity that I think most adults wouldn't be able to sell.

The extras are very enlightening as well with the voice-over commentary (although Frankie Muiz in real life is a long-winded gasbag).  I also thought the Spanish dubbing (which I happen to speak) was well done also.

The mom has got to be the sexiest woman who ever came out of Wisconsin. She's my favorite on the show. She's funny and I find her very attractive.

Some may not like to admit it, but this show does portray a family close to the 'norm'.  I think that makes it even better!

This show centers around a middle-class 'All-American' family who has their share of dysfunctional moments.  Both parents work to support their family of four boys.  The oldest is sent to military school early in the first season, but he remains very much a part of each episode's plot.  The other three boys are a handful to say the least.

1755383,5,B00006G8J7,"I'm reviewing the entire series, not just the three-disc first season (which is fine as a dvd release).
""Malcolm in the Middle"" is without doubt my favorite comedy television series. I enjoy a lot of good sitcoms (Frasier, I Love Lucy, Fawlty Towers, Everybody Loves Raymond, The Golden Girls, The Andy Griffith Show, The Simpsons) but this would be my 'desert island' show. For consistent laughs (with 151 amazing episodes) it gets the number one spot, bar none. It was so witty, clever, crazy, inventive, subversive, unpredictable, and delightfully silly. The writing is amazing. Every episode features terrific slapstick and ridiculous fun. You never know what's going to happen next.

Sadly, it seems we probably won't be seeing a release of seasons 2-7. A roadblock of sorts must have come up; probably expensive rights to the numerous songs featured during the show's run. The first season sold well, so I'm sure the studio was anxious to sell subsequent seasons. It's a shame, really. Nobody wins in these cases, not the customers, the studios, or the musical artists and their reps.

I have been recording episodes off cable. Sure, there are bootleg dvd sets available for purchase on the internet. However, most of them consist of a seven disc set. Think about that. That's seven seasons, one season per disc. Incredible. They must have jammed around 20 epsiodes on each disc. The picture and sound quality must be unbearable. The more content you put on a blank dvd, the worse the quality.
The only benefit of those sets would be the lack of commercials, and I'm sure the editing is substandard. So, beware if you are considering such a purchase.

It just isn't nice to leave us hanging for this long!!! Come on, release season two; I promise to buy it right away!

1755421,5,B00006G8J7,"This show is by far one of the best shows on television. In my opinion it is the best, however I'll let you decide for yourself how much you like it. I liked all of the episodes on these 3 DVDs (Some more than others, but overall they were all good). I instantly fell in love with this show, because it's one of the only shows ever that resembles real life. Istead of you sitting at home wishing your family were like the sitcom families on TV, when you watch this show you say somthing more along the lines of ""Oh my family's just like that.""

The acting in this show is great. All of the characters are really unique and show how people can be different. Take the character Reese for example: A bully who enjoys cooking, us there any other show on television with a charater like that. Then look at other shows where characters are exactly the same. For instance: The ""8 Simple Rules"" family and the family in ""The War at Home"" are exactly the same except Keri Henesy is a boy in ""War @ Home."" This show took a lot of actors who weren't well known in 2000 (Frankie Muniz was kind of well known then, but not as much as he is today) and made them into stars, and with made a T.V. show that won 5 emmys, won a peabody award, and is going into its 7th season!

I sure hope that after reading this you buy the DVD set too, or at least watch the show on TV. the Premiere is @ 8:30E/7:30C on Friday Sept. 23. Repeats are on Mon-Fri @ 6:30PM E/5:30PM C or at 12:30 AM (half hour after midnight)E/11:30 PM C.

P.S. people writing bad reviews for the show/ making fun of the actors:

You might look like you know what your talking about if you spell Frankie Muniz's name correctly.

Note the way I spelled it: It's Muniz not Munitz

and I bet Frankie MUNIZ gets an oscar long before you do

On top of that how can you justify the statement that the charaters look like geeks?

Or: They're as boring as dry meatloaf?

Where is the evidence behind any of those statements?",1121644800,3,1963,4.185676392572944

Lois (mom) disciplines in such unexpected ways and is so brazen (the ""no bra"" episode) that you find yourself in amazement at the way she runs her household. Hal makes so much entertainment out of unexpected moments...you have to admire his acting skills. And all the boys...hyjinx galore! Each area of life: family, work, school are all depicted with so many problems to overcome in their own quirky way that you leave each episode a little more content with your own problems in life.

1755474,5,B00006G8J7,"I have always been a fan of the show, but I missed the first season . Recently I bought this set, and season one has got to be one of the funniest seasons of this show. This show is so good because it relates to real life. Brothers fighting, parents yelling, and other real life adventures. This show deals with issues other shows refuse to touvh on, and I think that is an amazing reason to watch this show. It makes fun of all types of real things. Like missbehaving kids, money problems, stupid siblings, untrusting bosses, nerds and bullies, and the hell that some people call school.

This season includes:

Season 1

1. Pilot:  Malcolm finds out he is smart, and is moved to the nerd class

2. Red Dress:  Lois's big night is ruined when he beautiful red dress is found burned and noone will confess to doing it

3. Home Alone 4:  Francis watches his brother, and all hell breaks lose

4. Shame:  Malcolm beat up a seven year old

5. Malcolm Babysits:  Malcolm babysits for another family, and tries to live his life there, because he thinks its better thathis house.

6. Sleepover:  Stevie has his first sleepover and Malcolm gives him a night on the town.

7. Francis Escapes:  Francis leaves boarding school, to meet up with his ""Girlfriend""

8. Krelboyne Picnic:  Everything goes wrong at their annual Krelbornye picnic

9. Lois vs. Evil:  Lois gets fired after Dewy steals.

10. Stock Car Races:  Hal lets the kids skip school and go to the race track with him

11. Funeral:  The family plans to go to a family funeral, but nobody wants to go.

12. Cheerleader:  Reese likes a cheerleader and doesnt know how to ""woo"" her, so he becomes a cheerleader

13. Rollerskates:  Malcolm asks his dad for roller skating lessons, but Hal goes to far

14. The Bots and the Bees: Malcolm and friends build a killer robot while Lois is away, and Hal falls apart without her

15. Smunday:  Lois is sick, and thinks that Monday is actually Sunday so the kids go along with it.

16. Water Park (1):  The family visits a water park and everything goes wrong.",1106352000,8,2052,4.489130434782608
1755475,5,B00006G8J7,"A 15 year old's review:

For all those looking to buy this hilarious show, I urge you to get it! It is definately worth it. I watched just one episode of this show and was immediately hooked. This show is incredibly funny and yet realistic. The actors do a great job and the writers of the show keep comming up with great episodes. The first season is so great but I can't wait for the rest to come out on DVD. Frankie Muniz and Erik Per Sullivan both do a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat and rolling in laughter.",1103846400,11,528,4.076923076923077
1755476,5,B00006G8J7,"Other reviews have done a great job describing it, so here's another perspective on now good Malcolm in the Middle is:

We use Malcolm as a treat for guests.  Because the episodes are less than half an hour, we're not locking them into a long commitment.  Not to worry - after watching the pilot episode, they always beg for more.  Even though as hosts we've seen Malcolm repeatedly - and usually I'm not much for repeat viewing - we still laugh like crazy, sharing our guests' delight.  Only one couple was not amused, and we weren't surprised. (Thank God they're only once a year!)

Occasionally we watch the current episodes.  I'm reluctant, because I hate to see the kids grow up.  I know it's inevitable, but leaving that wonderful ""first season"" is kind of like leaving your own childhood - at the time you're glad you've finally grown up, but before long you're longing to return.  Anyway, with that sentimental caveat, I just wanted to say, that the quality of the series has been maintained - it's still hilarious!

So I predict, that Malcolm in the Middle will take it's place, along with the Honeymooners and Andy Griffith and Mary Tyler Moore, in the pantheon of all-time television comedy classics.  Yes, Folks, it's that good.  And though the quality has indeed held up, this first season may be the best.",1103846400,8,1319,4.6869565217391305
1755477,5,B00006G8J7,"Life certainly seems a bit more fair when quality television shows like MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE come to the surface. When the writing is fresh, the cast scores 110 %, and the humor is @ the top of it's game you just can't go wrong. When I was growing up I lived a simular life sorta like Malcolm's only minus the 165 I.Q., I'm no where close to genius. What I did have was 3 siblings I had to share everything with, the oldest was my sister who was never home (much like Malcolm's oldest brother Francis) and my two brothers whom loved to aggravate one another, punch and brake each others toys on purpose. When I say sharing I mean we all shared the same bedroom at one time. It was no party, but I wouldn't go back in time and change anything. Well, maybe somethings. ..You might be asking yourself why is this guy telling his life story. Well I'm only trying to say that this show is the closest thing to my life in the sitcom world and after I watched a few episodes I was hooked. But why is FOX taking their sweet time releasing the 2nd season?? It would have made a great 2004 Christmas gift.

This show is such a welcome reprieve from the run-of-the-mill sitcom that features manufactured jokes and cheap laughs.  While watching Malcolm, you will really LAUGH like you mean it.

""Malcolm in the Middle"" resp. in Germany ""Malcolm Mittendrin"" is absolutely my favorite series, before ""Friends"" and I heard this is the most popular series in the US. I'm afraid you can't buy these DVDs in Germany yet, I've been waiting so long and I'm still doing.
""Malcolm in the Middle"" meets exactly my sense of humor and it's the only series, at whose watching I have to laugh loudly at several times! It's not an usual series about a family, in that exactly this is perfect and if there's any confliction, there's all perfect again at the end of the show. ""MitM"" is more - I don't wanna say realistic - credible. And to that it's the funniest thing I've ever seen (apart from our rabbit wanting to have sex with our cat). In addition I like Malcolm speaking to the spectators. There's no reason for that, I think I just wanted to mention it.
In Germany the 4th season has just begun being shown at TV and I don't know how many seasons will exist once and for all.
I think you many U.S.Americans and Canadians should buy these DVD's and the ones of the following seasons to make Frankie Muniz (I'm dreaming of him!), all the other characters and ""MitM"" workers rich and able to produce anymore seasons of my and your favorite series!

1755559,5,B00006G8J7,"I started watching Malcolm in the Middle at the beginning of the current (just-ended) season, on Fox 5 (season four, I think it was)when Lois had baby #5, etc. I saw each episode of season four and enjoyed every one of them and adored several; I immediately got hooked on this show and ordered this DVD (season one, with special features) as soon as I realized it was available. Once I got it, I watched it straight through, more or less, over a weekend and MY GOODNESS!!!  The first season is FABULOUS!!! Linwood Boomer (creator of Malcolm in the Middle)is simply brilliant.  Each and every show of the first season is utterly hilarious AND well-written And witty AND smart AND succint AND moving AND incredibly well-acted by everyone involved, from the six principal characters (mom Lois, dad Hal, children/brothers Francis, Reese, Malcolm and Dewey) right on down through the supporting players (especially Francis's Drill Sergeant, Spangler, and Malcolm's best buddy and fellow genius, Stevie).  I really think that Bryan Cranston (Hal, the dad) should have won three Emmy awards by now...he is INCREDIBLE and utterly content to take a backseat to Jane Kazcmarek (Lois), because he obviously realized right away that it worked best that way.  Kudos to him for that! In my opinion, he shines the brightest in every scene he's in just because he's understands the Hal character so perfectly...he steals almost every scene from Kaczmarek's Lois who has more dialogue and is by far more dominant, louder, better-looking, and nuttier.  (Jane Kazcmarek has an easier role to play, in my opinion, than Bryan Cranston. She certainly does a great job and is as famous as Frankie Muniz (Malcolm) for her great work, but it's really Cranston who has a harder role and pulls it off brilliantly in every scene that he's in. Watch Cranston in the ""Special Features"" segments and you'll see how different he really is from the character he plays.) I'd have to say that Hal is my favorite character on this wonderful show, followed by Malcolm. Frankie Muniz as Malcolm is absolutely terrific and adorable and SO smart as an actor...he loses something in the later seasons, maybe because he grew so much and his voice changed and he lost the ""Adorable Little Boy Genius Perpetually Befuddled by his Family"" appeal...Muniz still does a good job now, certainly, but he was utterly superb in this first season. The season finale, which takes place in a water park, was my favorite (I was screaming with laughter), but a VERY close second was the ""Rollerskates"" episode. The first episode was also excellent, if slightly awkward and strange at certain spots, probably because every character was not fully defined yet and the actors were still feeling them out and getting to know each other. Only Maloclm remains the same character from that first episode through the rest of the season one episodes; the others change very subtlely (for the better).  MY GOODNESS, WHEN IS SEASON TWO COMING OUT ON DVD???  ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA??? I'm in withdrawal here!  HELP!",1057968000,4,3044,4.931640625

1755571,5,B00006G8J7,"If nothing else, this series deserves credit for the stuff it gets right! I have three younger brothers and a (sometimes) psychotic mother (and I'm taking the fifth on whether she's always been crazy or was driven there by her children); sometimes this show comes incredibly close to events within our household. Thankfully, we usually do less property damage.
Malcolm (as the title implies) is 'in the middle' of his family - as in, Malcolm is a middle child with two older brothers, Frances and Reese, and one younger brother, Dewey. Frances is at military school as a result of his discipline problems; Reese is the school bully, Malcolm is the 'normal' one (or so he thinks); and Dewey is the youngest and very precocious (honestly, I can't really describe Dewey, he just IS). His parents are Hal and Lois, a low level executive and convenience store clerk, respectively. Hal is loving but irresponsible while Lois rules the house with equal parts love and frightening insanity (don't get me wrong, she loves her kids, and they often deserve what they get).
Malcolm's world comes crashing in on him in the pilot episode as it is discovered that he is not nearly as normal as he hoped. He's a genius. A REAL genius. Against his wishes, he is transfered into the Krelboyne class (Krelboyne is the name of the advanced program) with the 'weird' kids, known to the rest of the school as simply 'Krelboynes' and led by their scarily cheerful teacher.
This introduction to Malcolm's world is hysterical and often offers great insights into kids, middle school politics (which do exist), family, and even sometimes society.
'Malcolm in the Middle' may not be everyone's idea of entertainment but it will always be one of my very favorites and this boxed set is worth every penny to the person who enjoys the show.",1057104000,5,1810,4.80448717948718
1755572,5,B00006G8J7,"Living outside the U.S. for a while now, I've been a bit out of touch with American television for the last few years.  So, when a friend of mine handed me this DVD set and said ""You've got to see this show"", I got my first taste of ""Malcolm In The Middle""...and was completely hooked.
This show is not only funny and original, but it seems to strike a familiar chord with childhood memories.  Not only mine, but also everyone that I've discussed this series with.  Although the family in the series appears (at first glance, anyway) to be thoroughly dysfunctional, they grow on you as the series progresses.  I began to recognize bits and pieces of my own childhood, whether it was some absurd thing said by one of my parents, a kid-like caper pulled off in school, or some friend that I had that didn't quite ""fit in"".  I can relate to this show.
The writing is excellent and extremely funny, even managing to put valuable life lessons across, without being heavy handed.  The acting is top notch, reminiscent of ""Family Ties"" and ""Home Improvement"" in its ensemble cast chemistry and tightness.  And, although a surprise, I found the unique innovation of not including a laugh track to be refreshing, allowing me to decide what was funny (almost everything), rather than trying to force me down the road of simulated amusement.
The DVD set is a great value.  Fantastic transfers (as best as I can tell, without ever having seen an actual broadcast), great sound, and jam packed with special features.  There's about 3 hours of commentary for selected scenes, a bloopers reel, 4 unaired opening scenes, 4 deleted scenes, and a handful of ""promos"".  There are also 3 fairly interesting featurettes covering the show itself, the crew, and a day in the life of ""Dewey"" (Eric Per Sullivan).  The only lame feature of the entire set was a small section called ""MalcolmVision"", which was basically just some framing goofs as a result of the program's shooting in a 16X9 format.  An incredibly small negative for what is overwhelmingly an outstanding boxed set.
Good show, good price, and exceptional entertainment...You just can't go wrong with this series.  I can't wait for the release of season two!",1056412800,86,2198,4.783068783068783

1755576,5,B00006G8J7,"I don't know about you, but I've always felt that The Simpsons didn't represent the goofyness at the heart of the American family. I'll admit it--the family on this television program represents mine at the most intimate level. One exception is that whatever humor we find in situations that occur in ours is usually in hindsight. Luckily we can laugh at this family the first time around.
The DVD is of exceptional quality. The full screen presentation does suffer from grain problems on occasion but, on the whole, the transfers are very good. The commentary, outtakes and gag reel are worth the price alone. While the show has continued to evolve and is still as funny as the first season (and, yes, I believe this is the best written sitcom bar none--it's also better written and funnier at a gutbusting level than the Simpsons. Don't get me wrong, I admire The Simpsons but it's strayed away from the very qualities that made it special and funny a long, long time ago).
Frankie Muniz is perfectly cast as Malcolm but, more importantly, the actors portraying this family are equally as loopy and fun to observe. I really haven't found a weak link in the first season casting. The pilot deservingly won Emmys for best direction and writing. The extended version adds a bit of additional fun that wasn't on the final aired version. Additionally, there are bits added to a couple of episodes that were deleted for time constraints and other reasons when the original episodes aired in 2000. It's amazing that such a quality show could ever have been seen as nothing more than a mid-season replacement.
While the box set is a bit light on episodes (there wasn't a full season produced during season one as it was a replacement series) the extras more than make up for that. Additionally, the commentary adds quite a bit to a couple of episodes and make the discs worth viewing again just to find out the odd little tidbits mentioned.
While Season Two would continue to build on the success of the first season, it wasn't until Season three that there was additional comic depth added to the program.",1051315200,35,2100,4.724795640326976
1755577,5,B00006G8J7,"Wow, So Malcolm in the Middle is going through what...?  It's fourth season I believe....  If you like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, King of the Hill.......then you will probably also like MitM.  I myself love the show.  I am a huge, huge Simpsons fan and I thought that no other show could ever compete with it.....then Malcolm showed up.  It's a hilarious show about a boy Malcolm, who is a genius, who lives with his sort of crazed/original/wacky family.  He has an older brother, and a younger brother and the three of them always get into HUGE trouble doing REALLY stupid/bad, but funny things.  When their mother always finds out about the stuff her boys did, she goes almost insane.  Their dad is a cool guy who sort of just lets things fly by.  He is sort of the nice one of the parents, but he does some wacky stuff too and basically everybody in the family.  Malcolm also has a brother who was really crazed when living at home so Hal/Louis put him into a military school.  At the military school, he gets into a bunch of trouble with the head/dean guy.  About halfway through the 4 seasons, Francis, (military school guy) ended up going to Alaska with his friends and worked for a really really mean lady a restaraunt who basically tortured...metaphorically.  Then he ended up finding his way to working on a ranch for this really weird foreign guy who pays him lots of money and gives him a car.  That foreign boss guy is really weird and funny in his own way.  Of course things happen at high school with Malcolm and Reese and their friends and girlfriends.  So you have a show that can be totally different each time, but every show is extremely funny.  You can have a show that takes place everywhere, mainly at the military academy, mainly at Alaska, mainly at the ranch, mainly at home, or anywhere that they go!  For instance:  In one show they end up getting stuck on a road in the middle of nowhere because there is a crash or something so the boys meet up with a girl in the desert terrain, one show they go to a water park, and in one show they go to a family renunion.  The show is just flat out a 10/10 star show and it definately competes with the simpsons.  I just wish that they would get season 2 out on dvd soon so that I can have all of the shows to watch again before seeing later shows.  The price is great too at many sites.  You get about 18 episodes and the extra features are pretty cool.  You have to buy this one.",1050710400,3,2457,4.326039387308534

This show has never been funny and ever since it has been put on the air FOX would rather play it than a brilliant show like FUTURAMA. Now that it is on DVD I wonder why shows like Seinfeld aren't. It is ten times funnier and more witty and it has earned the respect of viewers nationwide for the past 12-13 years. I know I am ranting but it makes me mad that shows like this get praised so highly when shows that are so much better are shoved under the carpet.,1050364800,7,563,3.9911504424778763

It seems weird watching these episodes now since the boys on the show are so much older these days, but that's not bad in any way really because these are deffinatley some of the best episodes.  My favorite episode out of the set would have to be ""Krelboyne Picnic"", that one was hysterical and also one of the first that really started to have more of a feel for what the show evolved into.  I liked some of the special features on these discs such as the bloopers, however the guys who do the commentary on the discs are pretty annoying in my own opinion.  The main drawback to the set is that some of the episodes really aren't formatted in great quality like you'd expect in a DVD, but whatever.  Basically, get this if you're a fan of the show.

Over the course of the summer it became a tradition: go to our secret place and watch Malcolm. with the amount of laughter that came out of the room I'm surprised that we never got caught! Anyway, when the summer was over I had less and less time to watch, and eventually had to drop the tradition. The moment I saw the collection at a store, I had to buy it. Not only is the show itself hilarious, the commentary is too! My friends and I had a marathon where we went through the whole collection, and we had a blast (despite being overtired and on too much caffeine.

1755596,5,B00006G8J7,"I only watched a part of MITM that first year on TV and for some reason didn't get into it. (I rarely watch commercial TV, and I prefer HBO on Sunday nights.) So I'm speaking up for all of you who may not have gotten into MITM - you need to get this DVD and catch up on what you've been missing!!!
This show has a wonderful mix of great writing, acting, and vision. I ""got it"" right away, to the point where I could anticipate what was happening next - which in no way destroyed the fun for me. The extended pilot had one of the biggest laughs for me, and I've forced my entire family to watch it for the pivotal, climactic scene. So far it's put everyone in the ""laugh until your gut hurts, slam your hand down over and over"" realm, or as we used to say in chatrooms, ROFLOLPIP.
Malcom's world is instantly recognizable even to those who had ""normal"" families. Raising 4 boys is quite a trial - my best friend grew up wtih 4 brothers, so I got to witness the craziness and even add to it. The mother is forced to be as tough as a marine sergeant, and I for one sympathise with her because the father is so totally ineffectual, yet still manages to be loveable. And I too was in a special gifted class for part of each school day, but luckily, as a girl I wasn't tortured too much. :)
The series never gets too sentimental, yet there are real moments of poignancy, such as when Malcolm connects with Stevie, a wheelchair-bound asthmatic. This character is amazingly done, you just have to love him. The focus of each show tends to split between Malcom's life at school, home, and then there's his older brother at military school, a whole other world, so it's really an ensemble cast. This allows for much more complex plots and diverse scenarios.
I'm really tired of the entire sit-com set up with its typical two sets filmed with three cameras, live audience augmented with phony laughter, with typical plots like ""the big lie."" It's just been done so many times I can't pay attention anymore.
Malcolm, however, re-invents the sit-com by using a single steadicam, extreme closeups, NO laugh track (yippee!), special effects, and direct interaction with the camera, so the audience ends up feeling like Malcolm's best friend as he shares the thoughts he cannot share with anyone else. Emotionally, you're right there with everyone else. No other sit-com gives the audience this experience. I fell in love with this show and look forward to buying the next seasons as they come available.",1044230400,3,2488,4.518847006651884
1755597,5,B00006G8J7,"When Malcolm in the Middle first began I was there for every episode.  And when it came out on DVD, I was like a child begging for it for Christmas.  And I got it.  Oh, and it was totally worth the begging.  It is by far my most favorite sitcom.  The workings of this show is so close to home, yet so unreal.  And besides, I happen to be a geek too.  I can relate to Malcolm's predicament.
Never seen it?  You should.  Shame on you for not watching Malcolm in the Middle.  Anyway, if you are considering it, I'd highly recommend that you buy it.  You'll get hooked.  And you know what?  When the next season comes out, I'm going to get my copy.
So, please, for laughing's sake.  Buy Malcolm in the Middle.  You'll laugh so hard, you'll have milk (or whatever you're drinking) come out of your nose.  Tears will come to your eyes.  You'll be rolling on the floor.",1043539200,10,862,4.190184049079755

We both laughed so hard we had to stop the dvd so we could catch a breath.  Once everyone found out we had this all our friends wanted to watch it too.  We ended up watch the entire season 4 times in about 2 weeks and it just gets funnier.  This show is great for kids & adults and both our American and Japanese friends love it.
I find that after watching it different things remind us (especially the song in the 1st show) of an episode and send us into fits of laughter.  Many times we all just sit around thinking how creative punishment can be.
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Malcolm.  Can't wait for the next season.",1043193600,4,776,4.032679738562091
1755616,5,B00006G8J7,"I bought this DVD to help cheer me up after I found out my Marine husband was getting sent to Kuwait. It is hilarious and helped keep my mind of of it! It contains 16 episodes, almost 8 hours of MITM hiliarity. The qualiy is very good and the special features are a nice bonus. I didn't finish watching Dewey's day job because I think they should have done things like that for all the characters. The theme song at the beginning menu and every episode started to drive me nuts, I don't think I will ever like it again! Other than that the dvd was well worth buying! I recommend this for any fan of the series. The best part of having the season in a set is you can see the characters grow and you recognize things in later episodes that were in earlier ones that you might have missed but watching only one episode a week on tv. For example in the episode where what I call ""Dewey vision"" is used he gets a blue Herbie doll after begging his parents. In episode ""Smunday"" the boys use it to wake their mom up.. well see the episode to find out why!",1042934400,4,1049,4.147058823529412

1755618,5,B00006G8J7,"Me and my sister imported this DVD, as we live in England. We had to have Malcolm in the Middle, because it is our favourite American sitcom on TV, as it shows real life how it truly is; not all the usual stuff you see on American TV!!
The DVD is great, 16 episodes of my favorite show, and they all have commentary on them if you like listening to how they made the programme. The special features are really good too, like ""Dewey's day job"" and the feature about ""Malcolm Vision"" where they messed up with Widescreen!
I think the next few series get worse each time, as they must be running out of ideas, so the first series is a must-have, as it's Malcolm at its best.
One thing to take into consideration is if you are importing it like me, it doesn't look too good on a non-NTSC compatable TV.. lucky for us we're getting a new widescreen TV soon :P",1041811200,2,854,4.213414634146342

They did a great job putting this DVD together, the chapters are very well marked and the quality is pretty darn good.  The only thing that annoyed me was the theme song at the beginning of every episode.  Having the theme song there makes sense, but it does get old after a while.  The special features on Disk 3 are very cool, showing you some fun and interesting facts about the filming of the series, including technical mistakes & out-takes.  If you enjoy watching the re-runs on TV and you're trying to decide wether to buy this DVD I'd say go for it... once you see it you'll be asking when Season 2 is coming out!",1041724800,5,751,4.26056338028169

I was a fan from the first commercial i saw, spotlighting moments such as hal's shaving in the pilot. It was an original show, a true treasure, and this is why i was obligated to purchase this set. It becomes funnier the second and third times, noticing little things, little lines, and the beautiful mis en scene. One such example was the mothers line that was drowned out with malcoms face-money-rubbing, ""what do you expect to happen when you don't change your underwear."" which strikes you, makes you laugh out of what you could only imagine was meant. It is worth buying. I don't care what anyone else says.",1041465600,,766,4.723880597014926

1755622,5,B00006G8J7,"We're all dysfunctional, and as such its been kind of insane to see perfect TV families like those seen in Full House, and Home Improvement, and the other TV sitcoms I've grown up with. My family certainly wasn't like that. I adore my siblings, and now that I'm 23 I get along much better with my parents than I did as a pre-teen, or even worse, as a teen.
 Unlike many sitcoms of the past, I can identify much easier with Malcolm in the Middle. I'm the oldest of my family, but I can feel for Malcolm, because a lot of what he goes through at school happened to me as well. The tale of a boy genius with a knack for getting into trouble is a very personal tale to me, and so Malcolm in The Middle very quickly became my favorite TV sitcom... a genre I usually avoid like the plague. Finally a normal family is on the airwave, and they're so normal it actually makes me appreciate my family a lot more!
 Its funny how everyone says at the moment that one day you'll look back and laugh... This is true. Suddenly the stuff I used to get into trouble for is hilarious, as were my parents clever punishments. My family and I watch this show and laugh while we compare notes on what happened when we were kids. My mom denied that she's a lot like Louis until she saw the episode where she found her red dress burnt and in the toilet... the clever, but not physically violent disciplinary actions were nearly identical to an incident involving me and some ceramics my mom bought... except in my story, I was the guilty party, not my dad...
 Its easy for me to declare Malcolm in the Middle the funniest show on TV, simply because of its slapstick view of otherwise serious issues. The show makes light of the average American family, and succeeds in getting the point across... even the insanely brilliant can do stupid things.",1041292800,,1822,4.352941176470588
1755623,5,B00006G8J7,"Though seemingly copying The Simpsons but with live people, this show is refreshinly original. Almost all of the shows' ideas are new, especially in the first season. One especially great thing is the absence of a laugh track which really annoys me on most shows and is really nice on this one.
All of the episodes on all of the disks are just hilarious, especially:
Pilot
Red Dress
Home Alone 4
Malcolm Babysits
Krelboyn Picnic
Funeral
Cheerleader
Rollerskates
Smunday
Water Park
I enjoyed every single one of these and could watch them lots of times without getty bored.
The Special Features are generally pretty good. The commentary is very insightful and enlightening and the others are fairly entertaining.
Overall, with a Hilarious show and good special features, how could you not get this?!",1041206400,8,798,5.007518796992481
1755624,5,B00006G8J7,"Well, I was disappointed to read that I wasn't the first person to equate the family on ""Malcolm in the Middle"" with ""The Simpsons."" But, it is true, this is the most functionally dysfunctional family on earth.  No counselor, no psychologist, not even psychiatrist could tame the insanity.  The cast is great.  Malcolm, played by Frankie Muniz, narrates the show and gives it an amazingly funny perspective.  Lois, the mother, is outrageously funny, she is insane and quintessential to the show. Hal, the father, is a bit of a bumbling idiot, but in a harmless and good way.  Francis, the eldest child, advises from afar his little brothers on the inner-workings of their mother.  Reese, the second child, older brother of Malcolm, is a bit of an idiot too.  Driven by anything that would torment those around him, he gets himself into a great deal of trouble.  Then, finally, there is Dewey. He is the youngest, he manages to get lost regularly.  He does things that would get an average 6 year old killed.
The first season is hilarious.  It is great to see how the show progressed from the pilot to the Emmy winner.  I look forward to the next season coming out on DVD.

1755656,5,B00006G8J7,"A great comedy series come few and far between in these current times of television. Even then, most of them are the same. What a blessing and a breath of fresh air ""Malcolm In The Middle"" was when it debuted a few years ago. This family was far from perfect. They weren't clean or in control. It has been said that this is like a live action version of ""The Simpsons"". That sounds about right. All 16 episodes of the first season are presented here in full screen format(thank god!). Each episode is rich with inspired comedic performances and hilarious and clever writing and direction. It's the first comedy to come along that has made me laugh out loud in years. The series is about Malcolm(Frankie Muniz), the middle child of a crazy family. He speaks to the camera while all of the zaniness goes on around him. He's usually a target for his older brother Reese(played by Justin Berfield), who's an obnoxious bully who always has an idea to cause mayhem or inflict some kind of pain and horror on his younger brothers. Ahhh, big brothers. Then there is little Dewey(Erik Per Sullivan), the baby of the three. Dewey is hard to explain. He doesn't say a whole lot. There is a fourth brother named Francis(played by Christopher Masterson), who has been shipped off to military school, which is where we see him throughout the entire season. I have saved the two best for the very last. Mom Lois(the brilliant Jane Kaczmarek), and doofy dad Hal(the equally brilliant Bryan Cranston). These two are unlike any parents seen on TV in a while. Lois is like a dictator. She is smart. She's tough. She knows when the kids are giving her BS and she doesn't take it. She has a way with punishing them. She knows her stuff. She seems to be the one of the two that is in control of the household and the family. Hal is like a big child himself. The punishing and everything is more Lois' department. He likes to have fun with the boys. He's a very likeable schlub who never seems to get a break. When he does, something goes wrong. These are two extremely interesting and brilliantly performed characters. Why these two haven't won emmy's yet is anyone's guess. The episodes themselves are classic. You can't go wrong with any of them. There are a few standout episodes on the disc. They are all standouts, but these are the best. ""Krelboyne Picnic"" takes place at a kid's party. Nothing goes right. The entertainers' acts bomb, families get into fights, and Hal serves up some less than desireable food. A good one. ""Funeral"" has Malcolm having a date, but is stuck having to go to a relative's funeral. He tries to scheme his way out of the ceremony. ""Cheerleader"" has Reese falling for a teasing cheerleader. He even joins her squad to be close to her and impress her. The two best episodes come late in the season. The first one being ""Rollerskates"". This is the episode that really made me worship the show. The episode that made this a can't miss show. Malcolm wants to rollerskate. This is music to Hal's ears. He teaches Malcolm all these techniques that only annoy Malcolm. The scene with Hal doing his schtick to the song ' Funkytown' is priceless. A classic gut buster. Perfect. The other episode is the season finale of which I forget the title of it. The family goes to a theme water park. In the meantime, Dewey is babysat by an older lady. The babysitter is played Bea Arthur. The scene with the two of them dancing to the ABBA hit 'Fernando' is another priceless scene until...well, that would be telling. Every other episode is great, but these are my favorites. ""Malcolm"" is zany, wild fun. But it's intelligently written and performed. It's a show for the ages. Get this disc and get lost in the greatness that is this family.",1040601600,12,3736,4.577611940298508
1755657,5,B00006G8J7,"The first season for Malcolm in the Middle was decidedly the best--when the boys where young enough so that the things they did were cute rather than delinquency, and when there were interesting concepts to explore.
And explore them they did.  The expanded ""Pilot"" is classic comedy TV. (though it is a pity they don't give us the pilot as aired, for comparison)  ""Red Dress"" shows us that Lois is capable of being played as being more than a harridan.  And ""Krelboyne Picnic"", one of the few episodes beyond the pilot to really use Malcolm's genius for plot purposes, is hysterical while defying political correctness at every turn.
Of the added features, the director's commentary is the most useful.  It isn't always just the director, the actors are given their shot at talking to us, as well.  It is at least amusing, and often instructive, to listen.  For example, the thick body hair on Brian Cranston in the pilot was yak hair, and he met the boys while wearing only a sock (er, in a strategic position, not on the foot).
These DVDs are further evidence that TV show producers are seeing DVDs as the means by which their works are going down to posterity, and they are giving us their best.",1038614400,5,1198,4.627358490566038

1755660,4,B00006G8J7,"I finally figured out how to watch TV.  (What little of it there is worth watching.)  Epsodic TV used to be at least somewhat practical, until hyperactive programmers started switching around the schedule like bush babbies on amphetimines.  Even before that there occurred incessently the ring of the phone, the pangs of hunger, the call of nature.  DVDs changed all of that.
Series' box sets are the most user-friendly way to watch the series you like.  This is no exception.  I managed with great effort to watch the 1st series when it was being broadcast, but after that it all went to Heck.
Then along came DVDs.
Now.  The packaging.  This set isn't the first with this problem and it sure won't be the last.  I acquired 2 problem sets this week alone.  Those clear trays sure do look classy, don't they?  They work fine if the hubs have a large enough diameter that they hold the discs securely.  Fortunately, my Malcom gripped the hubs so tightly that I nearly broke disc 1 extracting it from its tray.  This is clearly the lesser of the two evils.
In several other recent cases, the hubs were so small that when I turned them upside down, the discs fell right off.  When this happens inside a closed box, during transit, the discs jiggle around something awful.
With the clear trays, harder and potentially sharper, the discs can look like someone took a brillo pad to them.  Certain players are more tolerant of scratches than others.  This trait is usually covered in Consumer Reports reviews of players.  The current issue, for instance, mentions especially notable examples at either extreme.
My player is not listed.  It has to be very damage tolerant, though, because out of over 700 DVDs, the only ones with playing problems have had - you guessed it:  clear plastic trays and narrow hubs.
Pretty but impractcal.
Check your discs.  Especially the boxed sets, where some retailers may look askance at a return after 2 months when you finally get to that disc 6 with all the scratches on it.
Ah.  The material.  I am not too big on U.S. sitcoms.  Britcoms are another matter.  (Thank goodness for Amazon.uk and region-free players.)  I managed to actually plant myself in front of the TV at the appropriate times at the start of the first season of Malcolm and I remember enjoying it.  After that the comittment was too much and I drifted away.  After purchasing this set on a whim, while sitting through most of it, I laughed harder than I have laughed at a sitcom for a long time.
This is good stuff.  The Right Stuff.  (Just mind the boxes.)",1036800000,9,2556,4.630289532293987
1755661,3,B00006G8J7,"""Malcolm in the Middle"" is a hit series that features a dysfunctional family like ""The Simpsons"", albeit in live-action form. For such a recent series, ""Malcolm"" has found its way to DVD quite early, and plans have been made for the release of season 2 next year. The video and audio quality are decent for a TV series (no, the video is not anamorphic widescreen, even though it was filmed as such. This is explained on the DVD), and there are a good handful of extras such as deleted scenes, select commentary, gag reel, and more.
However, I'm not sure how strongly I can recommend this DVD set, even though its a solid presentation. When I originally viewed ""Malcolm"" on TV, I found myself laughing out loud every few seconds at the clever, witty jokes from the cast and writers, which is what prompted me to grab the DVD. But, upon a repeated viewing, the episodes don't hit me the same way any more. ""Malcolm in the Middle"" is a show that works because you have no idea what will happen next. Anything can, and often will, happen. That said, when you've seen the episodes and know how each joke will turn out, the comedy starts to wear thin. A lot of the material isn't quite as memorable as I once gave it credit for, which I found slightly disappointing. The best episodes on the disc were unfortunatly the ones I missed during the initial run. Maybe I have to give it a little more time, but while the show is similiar to The Simpsons, it still doesn't have its classic, collectible appeal.
If you plan on picking up ""Malcolm in the Middle"", it's worth the money in terms of what it gives you. FOX gives its fans some pretty good season sets of its TV shows. Just find an episode guide on the internet first and see if the season 1 episodes still pique your interest.",1036454400,17,1774,4.428134556574924
