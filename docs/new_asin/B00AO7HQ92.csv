Student activity fees at Gaston College were 6 dollars a semester back in 79.  Cheap price to pay for this awesome guy. RIP DOC. Ed Cox, Film historian.",1482537600,,262,4.24
8555238,5,B00AO7HQ92,"This documentary is highly recommended for anyone interested in bluegrass or folk music,it will leave you with a warm feeling for a warm human being.",1395014400,,149,5.0
8555239,5,B00AO7HQ92,"I really can't address how this documentary will touch those who don't enjoy the tremendous great fortune to be Doc fans, but for those of us who are, it is perfect. It breathes life into many of the great Doc and Merle stories that we have been hearing all these years. And the music, of course, is great as well.
If you don't really know who Doc Watson is yet, but would like to, getting this DVD could be the perfect introduction.",1390521600,,433,4.2926829268292686
8555240,5,B00AO7HQ92,"Guitar player Stefan Grossman has been releasing videos for years (first on VHS, and now on DVD) for many years on his Vestapol label. To date most fall in one of two categories: Instructional videos (which do include full performances of songs between the lessons) and performance videos (for the non-musician). To my knowledge this is the first ""documentary"" he has released. And,this is the first time that this 1986 documentary directed by Kevin Balling (a lecturer in the Department of Communications at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC) and Joe Murphy (a professor at ASU) has been made available on DVD. (It was released on VHS over 15 years ago but there were no ""chapter stops then and no ""bonus 1970 Concert). The 58-minute ""film"" (shot on video) takes front-and-center on this DVD and it's just wonderful! The two teachers followed the legendary Doc Watson (who we, sadly, lost last year) and his son, Merle (who died in a tractor accident in 1985) for a few days and capture then talking about their unique father/son relationship and playing music (along with Doc's former partners from the 1950s and early 1960s). We get a lot of short performances but some full ones too, including a great 50s rock and roll medley near the end (Doc, Merle and T.Michael Coleman - on bass). Though blind nearly all his life, Doc doesn't let that get in his way of living a normal life. When you see him in his carpentry shop hammering nails (and never once hitting his finger!) you have to remind yourself that Doc is blind? Not soon thereafter we follow Doc as he climbs a ladder to his rooftop to install a window on the third floor of his house!
The film contains some great early archival film performances too.  Grossman has ""indexed"" the DVD into chapters so that you can go back and just play the songs on future viewings. (These include a performance of Doc's wife Rosa Lee singing the song ""Wandering Boy"". )

The film is supplemented by a 25-minute TV show - ""Homewood"" recorded in Los Angeles in 1970 with Doc and Merle performing eight full songs.

Vestapol has other performance DVDs of Doc and Merle (originally released on VHS) but this new release is a welcome addition to the Doc and Merle legacy. I, for one, want to thank Grossman for giving us Doc fans a chance to see this film.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
