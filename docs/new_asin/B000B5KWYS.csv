2400175,5,B000B5KWYS,"Thie testimony of many of the actors was so interesting, because I have become quite attached to the series and only hope that you can get the final show back which is currently unavailable.",1342742400,,190,4.617647058823529
2400176,1,B000B5KWYS,"From the very first episode, I was totally entranced with this show.  I never missed an episode and now have it on dvd.  However, ""On the Ballykissangel Trail"" is very poorly made and omits quite a bit of information and scenery that would have made it great.  Fortunately, I did not buy it separately; it's an extra on one of the Series 2 dvd's.",1256428800,6,346,4.375
2400177,1,B000B5KWYS,"I would love to write a good review for this DVD, I was waiting for this one to complete my set of the series, but unfortunately I got my copy and it wouldn't play on my DVD player even though other DVD's had no problem. A second DVD was received and it too would not play.
I have been very disappointed as I believe the Mfg. was to blame for flawed DVD's",1231286400,5,355,3.9444444444444446
2400178,4,B000B5KWYS,"Great little documentary about the making of BallyK; however, the copy I downloaded to our TiVo was very poor quality.  Everything and everyone in the video was green-tinted.  I know it's an IRISH show, but this is ridiculous!",1210204800,2,226,4.921052631578948
2400179,2,B000B5KWYS,"This 45-minute behind-the-scenes dvd features brief anecdotes from Kieran Prendiville, the creator and main writer of Ballykissangel, and from the actors who portrayed Niamh, Siobhan, Kathleen, Liam, Donal, Father MacAnally, and Oonagh and Paul Dooley. The actors talk briefly about what it was like doing the series, its success, why they thought it was cancelled, and so on.

The focus, however, is very much on the impact the series has had on Avoca (ie. Ballykissangel), what with busloads of tourists and bumper-to-bumper traffic flowing through the town on a daily basis. There is the odd brief comment by a few of the local residents--like the local priest, for example--about the filming of the series and its impact. Equally, the dvd focuses to a large extent on the success of the series internationally, with the actors expressing both pleasure and amazement, as well as the odd attempt to reason why. Interspersed were a good many brief responses from visitors in the streets (mostly foreigners) expressing their love for the show.

Usually in a programme such as this, 45 minutes would fly by. I did not find that to be the case here. Unfortunately, there was substantively actually very little. Oh, there were a few interesting anecdotes--like the real Hendley's store carrying on business even while filming was going on (the real customers just used a back entrance), or Dierdre Donnelly (Siobhan) jabbing herself with a needle whilst learning how to handle the animals. There was also a very brief tribute to the late Tony Doyle (Brian Quigley), who died of a heart attack. However, with the actors each expressing similar views regarding the success of the series or its impact on Avoca, and with the many interspersions of visitors praising the series, there was quite a bit of repetition content-wise.

Most disappointing of all, however, was the ""tour"" (if one can call it that) Joe Savino (Liam) takes us on of Avoca. This had the potential to be quite interesting, but it was extremely poorly filmed. As Savino walked through the town and told us what was what, the camera was focused almost entirely on his face, with the occasional arm thrown in as he pointed out a particular landmark. If lucky, the viewer would get a brief glimpse at the landmark to which he pointed, but it was usually filmed too closely to get any real sense of the object's perspective with respect to its location within the town.

The final thing worth mentioning are the ""15 minutes of bonus interviews"" touted on the back cover. With five minutes per actor (and that includes a brief opening and closing segment for each), what one actually gets is a repetition of all the little anecdotes that were interspersed throughout the 45-minute programme by Aine Ni Mhuiri (Kathleen), Deirdre Donnelly (Siobhan), and Joe Savino (Liam). Unbelievably, Savino's segment included that same painful ""tour"" of Avoca!

Though I started off rather enjoying this little dvd, my level of enjoyment tapered off quite rapidly for the reasons mentioned. While it was nice to see a few of the actors chatting about the show, the dvd itself was not well produced and quite amateurishly filmed. The really disappointing thing is that it didn't have to be like this. Ballykissangel was such a sweet series, and with all the participation from Prendiville and so many of the actors, this dvd had the potential to be really good.",1167696000,41,3405,4.9562171628721545

2400182,1,B000B5KWYS,"As this was given to me as a gift, I can't complain about the price, but however much it costs, it's too much for this piece of fluff. As a BallyK fan you're much better off just watching re-runs of the show than watching a handful of the actors gush what it was like to film this in the town of Avoca. It's hackneyed and without merit. The 'interviews' sound as though they were filmed in the food court of a mall. And the 'bonus' interviews at the end of the piece actually define the words deja vu as they're just regurgitations of what you just got through watching! Everyone involved in making this piece of effluvium should be ashamed of themselves!",1022284800,8,655,4.377049180327869
2400183,3,B000B5KWYS,Not a whole lot of substance to this video; just a lot of folks talking about how great Ballykissangel was and how fun it was for the actors to make.  I was disappointed that some of the actors from seasons 1-3 weren't in it.,1458086400,2,225,4.113636363636363
2400184,5,B000B5KWYS,A wonderful look into the beloved Irish TV series. Involves interviews with some of the most beloved characters.,1454976000,,112,5.277777777777778
2400185,4,B000B5KWYS,Interesting behind the scenes look at how this series came about and where it was filmed.,1454457600,,89,4.625

2400187,4,B000B5KWYS,A very interesting prelude to the hailed show.  I only wish I could see Ballykissangel as my friends said it was terrific.  When will it be available again?,1448409600,,156,4.535714285714286
2400188,5,B000B5KWYS,"I needed something short to entertain me while I was waiting for a friend. I chose this because I am a fan of the series. It was great to see the actual town and meet the actors in person.  How much of acting is creating a whole new character and how much is calling on yourself to ""share"" the persona?  I admit it felt like peeping into the town to find the answer to that question.  I won't give it away, but it was worth the romp if you are a BallyK groupie.",1447286400,,461,3.935483870967742
2400189,3,B000B5KWYS,"A very short review on BallyK. Interesting but shallow in that they only covered a few characters, most of whom were from the later years.",1444176000,,138,4.56

2400192,5,B000B5KWYS,True fans will enjoy the background and inside information.  Of course the shots of the town used for the show are just beautiful.  To get to hear the actor's side of what it's like to work in a series is something special.  All in all well worth the price if you want to learn about what went into making the show.,1440806400,,315,4.131147540983607

2400194,4,B000B5KWYS,I came late to the series Ballykissangel and bought the entire series on DVD.  Loved it and loved this look back at the creation and filming of the show.  I caught a quick peek at Colin Farrell which was worth at least one of the four stars in my rating.,1436400000,,254,4.06
2400195,5,B000B5KWYS,I enjoyed this documentary of the village where the tv show was filmed.  If you loved BallyK you will enjoy this.,1435536000,,113,4.380952380952381
2400196,2,B000B5KWYS,Below ave for those of us that loved Ballyk!  Very few interviews with the original actors.  Didn't due justice to a great cast and show.  Very superficial.,1435276800,,156,4.703703703703703
2400197,5,B000B5KWYS,"bought this as gift for my Irish mom :) as a follow-up to buying her the entire series collection.  She loves all... it comforts her to see ""the old country"" and the Irish ways of the characters.  Highly recommend to anyone Irish or Irish-loving folks :)",1435190400,,254,4.5
2400198,5,B000B5KWYS,THIS SERIES IS VERY WELL DONE AND CAPTIVATING. WANTED TO CONTINUE SEEING IT AND NOW IT SEEMS THAT AMAZON PRIME DOES NOT MAKE IT AVAILABLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEETER CHOICES ON PRIME AND A REASON WE SUBSCRIBED. LET'S PETITION AMAZON PRIME TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AGAIN.,1433548800,10,265,4.541666666666667

2400201,5,B000B5KWYS,"An interesting insight into the series.  Enjoyed it very much.  Although it featured only 3-4 of the regular cast members, it was a good production.  NOW, we need Amazon to return the series to be available for viewing, so I can finish things up!!",1429401600,,247,4.568181818181818

2400204,5,B000B5KWYS,"I never caught the series during it's prime time but began watching in reruns. I missed the early shows and am so hooked, I had to order the series. It's a very refreshing and engaging show. Just finishing Season 2 and am glued to my TV.",1427068800,,237,4.173913043478261

2400206,5,B000B5KWYS,"This show inspired me to travel to Ireland. Of course, it's a little bit different when you get there. Fabulous show for the first 3 seasons.",1426636800,,141,4.461538461538462
2400207,4,B000B5KWYS,"A delightful bit of background on the actors and locations for Ballykissangel.  Hearing the actors' perspective on the storyline, places, and production was very interesting.  If you like the series, this is really worth seeing.",1426636800,,228,5.485714285714286
2400208,3,B000B5KWYS,Very dated and poorly done,1424390400,,26,4.4
2400209,4,B000B5KWYS,"Love the series. So liked this, but not loved it. Background information like you'd find in the 'extras' on a dvd. of the series.",1420502400,,129,4.416666666666667
2400210,3,B000B5KWYS,"This is a nice introduction to the real town used for the series.  There are some short interviews with several actors from the six seasons and the creator of the series.  I would have liked more information as to the reasons for the changes between season 3 and 4 and between 5 and six.  I know one of the main actors died after season 5, but the complete disappearance of several other rather major characters with no explanation in the show was troublesome watching it.  It would have been nice if they had explained what else caused the changes, and also, if known, why it was cancelled after season 6.  By the way, if anyone is a fan of LONGMIRE, Robert Taylor who plays Sheriff Longmire, played the priest in season 6 of BallyK. (a much younger Robert Taylor with his original Australian accent).",1420156800,2,802,4.541666666666667

2400218,1,B000B5KWYS,"I purchased the entire series, because I, thoroughly, enjoyed the series; however, ""On the Ballykissangel Trail"" was informative, unfortunately, for me, it lacked some of the main characters input AND I would love to see closed captioning.
Regardless, it was/is still worth the watch.",1405728000,,284,5.4772727272727275
2400219,5,B000B5KWYS,It was very informative.  The information gives a lot of incite into the story behind the story.  It would be very nice to have more like videos for shows in countries other than the USA,1402790400,,186,4.285714285714286
2400220,5,B000B5KWYS,It was a very interesting see the actors giving interviews. Enjoyed also the report abut the town and its beautiful surroundings and bit more of the story that's all behind it. Great work !,1395878400,,189,4.588235294117647
2400221,5,B000B5KWYS,"I love this show.  The way they have a priest with real feelings for women and his struggle to deal with his calling and his desire.  The new pope says it should be OK for priest to marry.  I like that, probably fewer scandals in the church that way. Enjoyed this series so much I am going to watch it again!",1395360000,,308,4.016393442622951

2400223,5,B000B5KWYS,"I bought this to watch on the plane ride to Ireland.  I was going to visit Avoca and see the location of the TV show.  It was fun to watch the actors talk about the show and how the filming effected the town, which looks the same as the movie.  I was a little disappointed because the actors who were interviewed were from the later seasons and I really liked the characters that were in the first three seasons of this show the best.",1385078400,,434,4.142857142857143
2400224,3,B000B5KWYS,"Nothing revelatory, but it was fun to see the cast talking about their experiences and the fans roaming Avoca. The film quality was very dull colored.",1383955200,,150,4.8076923076923075
2400225,3,B000B5KWYS,"This is a typical ""making of"" program; a public relations homage, with some information about the setting and interviews with the writer and many of the actors.

Fans of the show will enjoy seeing some of their favorites, as well as the town of Avoca where the exteriors were shot.",1381017600,,281,4.62
2400226,5,B000B5KWYS,"We really enjoyed the series, so we especially loved this look at the making of it. Count me among the millions who have sat on the bench in front of ""Fitzgerald's."" One of my favorite series.",1379894400,3,192,4.361111111111111
2400227,3,B000B5KWYS,not much cohesion to the presentation. Lot's of tidbits of information to the big fan. Most people will not find it edifying.,1378252800,,125,4.7272727272727275
2400228,1,B000B5KWYS,Terrible.  None of the charm or interest of Ballykissangel.  Do not waste your time.  Watch a favorite Ballykissangel episode instead.,1375920000,,134,5.6
2400229,4,B000B5KWYS,I have just started to watch the episodes of Ballaykissangel and I am enjoying the quaintness of the whole area it is filmed in. I loved doc Martin and this reminds me of the quaint setting Dic Martin took place in. It's a relaxing show to watch and knit and spin with since I am an avid knitter and live to spin fleece while watching this British show.,1372896000,,353,4.205882352941177
2400230,3,B000B5KWYS,Filmed at the beginning of the taping of the beginning of the sixth & final season the viewer gets to make a final farewell to those characters he came to love so well.,1367107200,,168,4.121212121212121
2400231,5,B000B5KWYS,Having watched this series for a couple of years on PBS it was great to see the interviews with the actors. Very informative.,1362614400,2,125,4.478260869565218
2400232,5,B000B5KWYS,This is a charming series that takes one back to a simpler time and place.  The character interaction is well done and well cast.,1362528000,,129,4.375
8081531,5,B000B5KWYS,We were late to join in and watch this show - But fell in love at first sight!  We have watched all seasons 3 times now and are unable to find it anywhere so we can watch it again.  Please bring this series back to Prime.,1521072000,,221,3.782608695652174
8081532,5,B000B5KWYS,Loved loved this trailer .  We have watched all the seasons and fell in love with Ballykissagel.  Would like AMAZON to carry the various seasons as Prime.,1483574400,,154,4.666666666666667

8081535,3,B000B5KWYS,Loved the first three seasons of this show. I wish the documentary had included more from those seasons. Overall it was nice to see the real village and how the show impacted the lives of the people.,1478217600,,199,4.405405405405405
8081536,4,B000B5KWYS,"If you're a fan of the show, you will certainly enjoy this supplement to the series.  This documentary is mainly about the small town where most of the exteriors were filmed, and it has the same feeling as Ballykissangel--very pleasant without much drama.  There are a lot of interviews with cast members about how wonderful it was to work on the show. There is a long talk with the creator/head writer, including why he made certain sometimes controversial decisions.  There is a nice segment where Joe Savino (Liam) wanders around the town reminiscing with the residents and visitors.  It ends with everyone discussing their feelings regarding cancellation of the show.  There are no shocking secrets revealed or earth shattering surprises unveiled--just a nice stroll down Ballykissangel's Memory Lane.",1473379200,,805,5.2578125

8081540,4,B000B5KWYS,I was quite disappointed that the number of the earlier cast members were missing...  But all in all it was a nice thing that they did that to help put a bit of a close on a wonderful wonderful series that I thoroughly enjoyed...,1459209600,,229,4.204545454545454
