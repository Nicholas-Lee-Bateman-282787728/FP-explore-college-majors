8685136,5,B00OW7VQUA,"Blue Denim began life as a Broadway play by James Leo Herlihy, who would go on to write the novels All Fall Down and Midnight Cowboy, both turned into fine films.  The cast in the film of Blue Denim is terrific straight down the line, there's a wonderful score by Bernard Herrmann, who might seem like an odd choice for such an earnest drama, but his score works perfectly, and it's only in Philip Dunne that things aren't artful.  He's a fine writer, but as a director he was kind of a bore.  The transfer is great - black-and-white scope, sharp as a tack, and gorgeous contrast.",1533859200,,580,4.401869158878505

8685141,5,B00OW7VQUA,"Miss Lynley's and Mr. de Wilde's acting--along with the rest of the cast's--are superb in their respective roles.  The show is a great improvement on the play, in which the baby is killed.  Toward the end, Arthur (de Wilde) finally goes to his father and tells him everything, and Janet (Lynley) and their baby are spared an abortion.  I have seen this movie so many times.  Each time I inwardly cheer a little at the close as they set out to face sudden adulthood--to wed, grow up, and make a home for their baby.",1479168000,5,514,4.4361702127659575

8685144,4,B00OW7VQUA,"Blue Denim,"" made in 1959, boldly addresses teen sexuality at a time when Hollywood was beginning to treat this age group as real individuals with real problems. Before this, the Hollywood notion of teen ager was Andy Hardy, whose biggest difficulty was where he and the neighborhood kids would put on a show. Based on the hit Broadway play, Blue Denim is an intelligent, sensitive portrayal of pregnancy and family dysfunction, focusing on Arthur Bartley (Brandon deWilde) and Janet Willard (Carol Lynley), who discover they're in trouble after their first and only sexual encounter.

Though the film doesnt treat teen pregnancy lightly, it doesnt resort to melodrama. In fact, the movie realistically deals with a difficult subject, particularly since it was made during the Eisenhower years, when Hollywood was notorious for downplaying controversy in order for its films to reach the widest possible audience. Previous Hollywood films that dealt with out-of-wedlock pregnancy focused on mature and/or disreputable women. Janet is the typical girl next door, so her character generates audience empathy almost immediately. Arthur is depicted not as a wise guy looking for a quick score so he can brag to his buddies, but as a caring, if naive, 16-year-old who feels genuine affection for Janet. Since both deWilde and Lynley are young and attractive, they defy stereotypes of the time.

Janets father (Vaughn Taylor) is an upstanding college professor determined to raise his only daughter with a strict code of morality. Arthurs father (Macdonald Carey) is a retired army officer who repeatedly preaches about the value of life in the service and is preoccupied with his moments of past glory. Warren Berlinger plays Ernie, Arthurs best friend, who doubles as Arthurs confidante.

The films ending, unfortunately, seems a cop-out in an otherwise forward-thinking picture, but I suppose under the old Production Code, it was necessary in order to get the movie made. For the most part, however, Blue Denim is still a powerful motion picture. The unrated, widescreen DVD release contains no bonus features.",1461542400,11,2108,5.286567164179105
8685145,5,B00OW7VQUA,"I love this movie.  It's a classic.  It may have been make in 1959, however, it is still relevant today.  The principles don't change the message.",1417996800,7,146,4.538461538461538
