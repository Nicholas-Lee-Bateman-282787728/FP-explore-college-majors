2916828,1,B000U6YJME,"Hello World,
  I'm really starting to give up on anything new in horror. But who cares about me? Well, just a warning for wary wayside folk who havn't viewed this little piece of Uli Lomelish garbage! Wow everybody lets shoot sodium penethal(sp) and sit around in a circle contemplating what to do with this guy we tied up. To bad some a%$ kicker didn't find their invitation. Extremely unlikable characters kinda original story and about 2.5 mins. total of the ""murdering"". What a waste of my life. I coulda been cleaning pubic hair out of my shower drain. Good luck",1194912000,3,567,4.66
2916829,5,B000U6YJME,"A real treat for indie film and comedy horror fans! Director Jeremy Saulnier and his close knit collective of actors, writers, and make up efx crew put together a well shot, funny, gory piece of cult movie fun that you'll want to show all your friends!",1193443200,5,252,4.5
2916830,2,B000U6YJME,"Take the decent premise of a black invitation to a MURDER PARTY blowing down the street and someone picking it up and alot of ideas come to mind.
I kind of expected what follows but to its credit the movie isn't entirely predictable or tiresome.  The drug addled exploits and dialogue of the main characters are mildly entertaining if not overtly self aware and hyper hip low budget versions of your average Bret Easton Ellis college kids trying to mimic Man Rey and the idea of ""murder as art""
  It feels like a decent staged student film in the end however despite a crank eating canine, several effective old school eighties F/X injuries and an unlikely death by pumpkinbread.  I didn't feel like I completely wasted my time with this one and it has an okay HALLOWEEN (the holiday vibe) it just isn't compelling, believable or funny enough to recommend it to anyone or to watch it over again.",1192924800,4,895,4.610062893081761
2916831,5,B000U6YJME,"This is probably the funniest ""horror"" movie I've ever seen -- and it is THE perfect flick for your upcoming Halloween party (provided your friends are intelligent enough to appreciate the humor).

Without giving away too much of the plot, I'll try to tell you what I can about this monumental cinematic achievement.  The box describes Murder Party as ""Napoleon Dynamite meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which is somewhat accurate -- but I was expecting something much different (gratutious & meaningless violence), and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the writing, directing, acting, photography, special makeup FX, and limited use of digital effects were all top notch.  Not bad for an indy film with minimal budget.  It was very obvious that these good folks enjoyed working on this project very much -- unlike the joyless and soulless dreck being churned out by major studios nowadays.

In short, doofus loner is walking home from work to spend Halloween night alone in his apartment watching videos.  The wind blows something along the sidewalk which he picks up: lo and behold, a hand engraved invite to a Murder Party -- with the ominous direction, ""come alone.""  Doofus decides to make a ""knight in armor"" costume out of cardboard boxes and duct tape before proceeding to his rendezvous with destiny -- in the spookidy abandoned warehouse district.

Upon his arrival, he finds a demented cell group of drug abusing art school dropouts who thought it'd be funny to joke about killing someone in the name of Art.  ""We didn't think anyone would be stupid enough to actually show up!""  Darwin's Law of Natural Selection in action.  Anyhow, mayhem ensues, then an accidental death turns things ""serious"" -- and then things skid completely out of control: after which they exit the warehouse and hit the streets running.

Two of the art school dropouts' costumes were straight out of early cult cinema: replicant ""Pris"" from Blade Runner, and one of the baseball mimes from The Warriors.  The baseball mime is a painter who is totally psychotic -- possibly in real life, as well.  The scene where he goes nuts with an axe was actually a bit scary, because apparently HE WASN'T ACTING (the director said that all this terrifyingly vile stuff was coming out of his mouth that they needed to edit out of the soundtrack).  Then, when he was being interviewed in the Special Features without his makeup, his face reminded me of a fellow I knew back in high school (also an actor) who was psychotic for real.  He'd be just having a normal conversation when suddenly his eyes would glaze over and he'd go all zombie-nutso, not saying a word as he stared straight ahead with a blank expression as he tried to kill you . . . but I digress.

Anyhow, this film has the most realistic depictions of brain trauma that I've ever seen in a horror film (contrary to popular belief, it generally is not an instant kill, and victims can remain standing and semi-lucid after taking a mortal injury: one young lady asks if anyone smells ""freshly mown grass"" after a puncture of the temporal lobe, and another fellow gets really pissed off after being shot twice in the head with a low powered Makarov).  The chainsaw special FX was very well done -- and you won't guess how they did it until you watch the Special Features.  And -- most importantly -- Murder Party has THE ABSOLUTE BEST ENDING I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY MOVIE OF ANY GENRE.  Not a ""surprise twist"" at all -- just very understated, quite realistic, and probably the only way this movie could've ended.  I sat there with my mouth open for a few moments, then, upon realizing the movie was over, laughed and laughed and realized it was pure genius.

""Murder Party"" will be to Halloween what ""A Christmas Story"" was to Xmas -- a cult classic which you must purchase to watch every year at your Halloween Party.",1192838400,14,3858,4.761261261261262
2916832,4,B000U6YJME,"There is an offbeat vibe to ""Murder Party"" and I had the sense that I was not quite in on the joke while watching this 2007 horror comedy.  Then I checked out the special features afterwards and watched ""Extreme Truth: The Making of 'Murder Party,'"" and discovered that most of the principle characters in this movie have known each other when they were kids, when they spent their free time making movies with a VHS camera.  You know how M. Night Shyamalan usually throws one of the films he made as a kid on his DVDs?  Well, all we get here are clips of their adolescent attempts at blood and gore recorded for posterity on videotape, you do get a real sense of the fun they had killing each other and employing rudimentary special effects.  Many years later, after having gone their separate ways to various film schools, they have reunited as The Lab of Madness and produced ""Murder Party.""  So if the people you see on screen seem less like professional actors and more like kids running amuck in a candy store, there is a reason you are picking up on that vibe.

The film takes place on Halloween night in Brooklyn, where a windswept invitation to a party ends up in the hands of hapless Christopher S. Hawley (Chris Sharp).  Creating a carboard costume as ""The Brown Night,"" Chris leaves his cat Sir Lancelot and a bowl of candy corn behind and goes off to the party alone, as instructed.  Once he arrives at the Murder Party he discovers it is called that because the group of misfit waiting for him intend to kill him in the name of their art.  Well, actually their goal is to get money from their rich patron, who they think will be impressed by a ritualistic killing as an example of cutting-edge performance art.  Suffice it to say that things do not go as planned.

""Murder Party"" is decidedly a tongue in cheek horror comedy and as such is most definitely a hit or miss proposition.  Some will embrace the film as a prime candidate for Midnight Movie status and others will be sorry they ever checked it out.  But the film proudly proclaims itself to be the winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, which sounds pretty impressive and like something fans of the genre should check out.  Then again, the other Audience Award went to ""Commode Creations: The Artwork of Barney Smith"" for Best Anarchy Film, so who knows what the mind set, let alone the mental stability, of this particular audience might have been when they voted.  The gags with the gore are better than the attempts at humor, but I liked the tongue in cheek approach and the idea that if the hole you are digging for yourself keeps getting bigger, why not embrace it and go along for the ride?

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-and-Breakfast/dp/B000A3DGEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead and Breakfast</a>"" remains my personal favorite when it comes to nominating a horror comedy to be the next Midnight Movie, but ""Murder Party"" is a decent honorable mention.  The DVD extras include commentary ""featuring The Lab of Madness,"" which is more retrospective than introspective, but mainly because you get the feeling the gang cannot really wrap their minds around the fact they actually got to make a real movie.  There are a few outtakes and bloopers (you would have expected more and you get the feeling these guys found these clips funnier than we do), instructions on ""How to Make Your Own Brown Knight Costume,"" and ""Pumpkin Bread Recipe"" and ""Valediction in Black: Lexi's Art Installation Video"" (i.e., the film within the film).  ""Murder Party"" may not be your cup of team, but it should not prove to be a jug of Acetic Acid either.",1192492800,11,3711,4.7703125

""Murder Party"" is really more of a comedy than anything, but definately has it's fare share of grizzly blood & gore for even the most hardened of gore hounds.  Murder Party is about a lonely nerd type who happens upon an invitation around Halloween.  He gets all dressed up in a ridiculous cardboard costume & is off for the ""Murder Party"" with Pumpkin Raisen bread in tow.  It turns out some weirdo artsy fartsy types have set up to murder whoever arrives with this invite.  That's all you really need to know as not to spoil anything.  It kinda reminded me of ""Bottle Rocket"" (another movie you should check out if you haven't already seen it) only with murder & more blood & guts.

I didn't think I really dug the horror comedy genre until I watched Murder Party. Yes, Id seen Cabin in the Woods before, and yeah, it was Joss Whedon, and clever, and funny, but Id also tried a couple of movies like Stitches (a clown movie), Birdemic, S. O. B., even Dale and Tucker andwell, I was amused, but i wasn't impressed. Before Murder Party, Cabin in the Woods was probably my favorite, but it was an ambivalent favorite. Surely, that couldn't be the best there was, right?

Murder Party changed my mind. Murder Party does so much so successfully  heck, lets call it impressive.

Theres a lot to love in this film. Both script and plot are completely cohesive  everything makes sense, as it were, from why each characters present in the movie to why they're doing what they're doing. The movies rife with clever nods at several essential horror movie tropes, as well as references to cult classics. The minds behind Murder Party seem to be not only horror enthusiasts, but general movie fans as well. That combination of love for the genre, plus comfort with the medium (especially style and method), really results in something special here. If you want to get sly-grin-clever with meta-analysis here, this is when youd point out that Murder Party proves to be a satisfying, low budget indie breakout in Halloween disguise. At first glance its another cheap horror flick, a B-movie at best. But underneath this facade hides 90 minutes (or so) of genuine entertainment. You will not regret these 90 minutes. I promise.

What do I love about Murder Party? Honestly, what isn't there to love? But Ill try to highlight a few key strengths.

First off, (in the first 20 minutes, really) our main character/would-be victim here, Christopher, is not only endearingly characterized, but skillfully so. I fall in love with his utter relatable-ness in fifteen minutes, every time. So much of his personality and life is conveyed with one, maybe two, simple and straight-forward scenes which contain no other human characters. The films denouement is spectacular, and sets us up for an evening where the events and character action follow, with complete sense, from its inception. Have I mentioned how rare of a quality this is, especially in horror?

Every character in Murder Party is gifted with a complete personality, individual motivations and (some) backstory, and actions which nearly always make complete sense  even if you don't agree with them, at all. Many of the characters are selfish; many are lying, to themselves or others; and each one schemes towards some higher goal throughout the course of the movie. Its this goal which drives them each to the films resolution, and creates many amusing twists and turns in the plot along the way.

For every jump scare some other favorite horror movie pushes onto its audience, Murder Party has a smart moment, a funny reference, a clever tidy movement of plot. Its low budget but not obviously so, which is incredibly hard to pull off in this genre, where special effects often drive movies more than they ought  SFX, really, exist as embellishment, and should influence the film as such. No more. It is a pity so many directors and producers go computer-mad with their recorded product, as if impossible mists and digital monsters are really whats scary in the world.

No. Murder Party knows the truth. Its not fiction that we should be afraid of. Its the capabilities we all have, the ones that lie in each other. What would the person next to you do, if you were between them and a million dollars? Or a lifelong dream? Or true personal fulfillment?

No one has nightmares about blood that creeps out of walls at its own desire. They have nightmares about interactions with others. Unknowable, oblique others.",1473552000,4,4201,4.91937765205092
2916843,5,B000U6YJME,"Murder Party is a horror comedy that is kinda hard to describe but it is funny, really gory and really unorthodox i'll admit.

2916849,4,B000U6YJME,"There are a lot of movies out there that are unknown, but really should be. Murder Party is one of them. This movie is extremely funny, clever, well-acted, and just fun to watch. The writer and director, Jeremy Saulnier, is getting rave reviews and much-deserved attention from his latest movie, Green Room. That will undoubtedly lead fans to this and Blue Ruin, another movie by Saulnier that is just as deserving to be watched. This writer/director is on the rise, and judging by the last three movies he's done, he's only going to keep improving.

Aside from a couple of short films, Murder Party was Saulnier's first official film. Give it a watch and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and entertained.",1468886400,2,711,4.827868852459017

It's got it's moments and was certainly fun and funny in different parts but by the time it gets to the final 30 minutes or so, it's pretty much run it's course and things really start to drag.

She thinks so too, but she keeps seeing them. Thankfully she has a friend that she goes to see most of them with.

There is a problem though. That friend sometimes watches things that she hasn't seen yet that are available on one of the streaming services. Then the wife is told to watch this. And she does. Meaning that I do to.

So Im not a fan.

But this one was fun. It is a bit of horror, but there is a self-awareness that really works in the movie.

You had the cliche blonde w#0re' , the obessed friend zone guy (the werewolf mask dude), the creepy Arteeest' as they like to call themselves(the guy who was dressed as a vampire at the beginning), the depressed outcast who hates the world and everyone else secretely(babe ruth/half snoopy wannabe), the typical Russian Mobster,  and the liar who was obviously lying about the grant money and who he was? Seriously
3. Filming location was even worse, I now understand why IMDB has this movie down as literally no budget, a guy like myself with a DSLR Camera could have probably filmed better.  There was no location appreciation the warehouse literally looked as if it was borrowed for free with other  peoples personal belongings.
4. There was NOTHING FUNNY about this movie at all, I was expecting something like Shaun of the Dead, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, etc.. in other words Horror/Comedy! This was more like a Drama/Indie type film. and I am sorry I didn't notice until I read the blogs on this film that it proudly claims to be ""Indie"" which is a Genre of film-making that I despise because it is very subjective, and biased. Kinda like an inside Joke type of situation where you don't know what the flipper' is going on.
5. What was up with the costume? was it suppose to be a form of symbolism or what?? Come on dude take it off and your get away would have probably succeded from the get-go.
6. This movie is very good at decieving you from the Cover. There is literally no action or movement for a whole 50 or so minutes of the film. Then at the end the little action and movement we do see is really poorly played out.

My Goal is to make you the viewer aware of these things, if you like these type of College House/Low Budget Production Company/Indie Type/Slow Moving Movie...Then this is for you.

But it is not for me.",1347321600,,2434,4.350220264317181
2916882,5,B000U6YJME,"I had passed up this DVD a couple of times at Blockbuster but every time I went in to rent something, I had to pick it up and look at the preposterously costumed character on the cover. And I would read the back. ""Napoleon Dynamite meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" it said. I narrowed my eyes suspiciously. In my house, one NEVER invokes the name of Napoleon Dynamite OR the Texas Chainsaw Massacre unless one means business. Well see about THAT! I thought to myself one afternoon and finally took it home.

I started watching, mentally preparing to count the hack plot devices and script cliches. Five minutes after the opening credits I had forgotten my niggling intent and lost myself in what turned out to be a wry, witty comic horror gem. The premise is surprisingly fresh & slightly farcical. A hapless schmoe finds himself the center of a bizarre plot in which a group of hack artists plan to kill him in the name of art. Bungling chases, attempted murder, actual murder, sex, drugs, rock n' roll, & accidental maiming by fire are just a few of the mishaps and perpetrations which follow. This is offbeat, dark comedy at its finest. Everything was on target. The effects were great- much better than many films with twice the budget. The script was witty and engaging and the story unfolded and progressed at a pleasing clip. The acting, usually the bane of the indie movie, is fantastic. Chris Sharp is completely believable as the nerdy Christopher who is deadpan yet unintentionally silly and a real study in understated absurdity. He would indeed have been right at home in the Napolean Dynamite movie.

In short, this movie is 90 minutes well-spent. Murder Party is not just a good indie film. Its a good film PERIOD. It won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival as well as deadlantern.coms FIRST annual Splatcademy Award for Best No/Low Budget Horror.

2916886,3,B000U6YJME,"From the ""Lab Of Madness"" comes Murder Party (2007) is a wacky, unpredictable, horror comedy that most will either love, or regard as too off the wall.  While creative and entertaining, it may be too weird for some.  It is an independently produced effort, where many involved were part of a group of filmmaking friends, who made horror movies, while growing up.

It's Halloween in New York City, and Christopher Hawley (Chris Sharp) a parking enforcement officer, has in his hands an invitation to a murder party.  He constructs a costume out of cardboard, and dresses up as a medieval knight, complete with a cardboard broadsword.  Taking along a loaf of pumpkin bread, he heads off into the night for the party.  Hawley winds up a warehouse in a grungy area of the city, and wanders inside, where he is jumped and tied to a chair, by an assortment of characters dressed in costumes.

The group are apparently art students of various disciplines, involved in a group project to murder someone.  The originator of this macabre art project is a fellow named Alexander (Sandy Barnett), who is a sort of a sponsor/guru to the group.  Alexander, supposedly has access to grant money to fund various artistic projects, which has the students vying for his favor.  Alexander arrives at the party, with his dog Hellhammer, and drug dealing, gun toting pal Zycho (Bill Tanigradi).  Things get even stranger, with drug induced confessions, cocaine snorting, dancing, drinking, and sex.  Stacy Rock as Lexi, helps keep things from getting too dull, with her lively antics.

Paul (Paul Goldblatt) a photographer, intends to capture the murder through his camera lens, and the unexpected arrival of his photo assistant leads to an argument between Paul and Alexander.  This conflict starts a chain reaction that leads to rampant and outrageous violence that explodes out of control.  To the cry of ""Everybody dies!"", the ""party"" soon spreads out of the warehouse.  Bill (William Lacey), a painter, is armed with an axe, and a badly burned Macon (Macon Blair), has a chainsaw.  The bloodletting peaks, as what was to have been an exhibition of body painted art, is transformed into something quite disparate.

Murder Party has quite a long fuse before the violence explodes, and is mostly a freakshow until then.  Things remain unpredictable once the excitement finally starts, as at long last Hawley gets to do something.  The special effects used in the more gory aspects, are pretty well done.  You will have to decide, whether a good splatterfest is enough to overcome a disjointed, semi-coherent story with some strange and unlikeable characters.

Give the filmmakers some points for originality.  Besides realizing their childhood dreams, the intention of these long time friends, is apparently to make some kind of statement regarding art and artists, but what that may be, is open to discussion.  Hardly your standard horror film, Murder Party will probably appeal most to those that like their thrills weird and twisted.",1285891200,,3017,5.036290322580645
2916887,1,B000U6YJME,"Great beginning. Decent ending. This is a party you can miss though. It's the middle part of the movie I fell asleep during and had to go back and watch. Nice work, great camera shots and effects for an indy film. I'm just not much into a movie that centers around a bunch of dope heads sitting in a circle for a long time in a warehouse and talking nonsense.

If Shaun of the Dead and Napoleon Dynamite did meet during a Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it ended up being anything like Murder Party I don't think they would tell anybody. I know they wouldn't break any box office records.

If you do get the movie and watch the ""making of"" extra you can't help but like the kids that put this movie together. They've been making home movies since the 80s and now they are living their dream.

2916888,4,B000U6YJME,"MURDER PARTY is a great little Independent Horror entry, even if it does play off of obvious homages and borrowed techniques. A clueless do-gooder finds an invitation to a ""Murder Party"" on Halloween, but he realizes he should have passed when the invitation turns out to be all too literal. The group of pretentious art students he stumbles upon tie him up and argue over how they plan to kill him in the name of art. The strength of the film lies in the hilarious physical humor played out through the subtle character nuances, particularly those of our hero knight. Audience members will immediately recall the various Halloween costumes of the antagonists that are borrowed from classics like BLADE RUNNER and THE WARRIORS, and there are many clever quips that Horror and SciFi geeks will giggle over. After a steady build, the final act is soaked in several gory deaths, complete with chainsaws, decapitations, and beatings. The small warehouse setting feels much more expansive due to the close shots and angled framing. Though the knight has minimal dialog, his few lines are smart and very funny, and his character is played out through his facial expressions. Much of the dialog between the other characters can feel forced at times, but there is still plenty of fun to be had. While it draws from many superior films, director Jeremy Saulnier has taken all the right notes and turned them into a sharp and brutal little Horror Comedy that is sure to please any genre fan.

The main character (well, the ""victim"") Chris- is like Walter from Bucket of Blood in the sense that he is the lonely guy looking to fit in- oh and the whole pancake mix thing in the beginning that was used in Bucket of Blood. The whole murder as art thing.

I loved the whole pretentious ""hipper than thou"" spin with all the characters- minus Chris that is. Speaking of Chris- what was up with that cardboard costume? LOL. Hello Monty Python!!! One of my favorite lines was ""I didn't sign up for a second degree assault party"". I love that. Cause its clear they also didn't sign up for a murder party. Not really. Just trying to fit in, be ""different"" in that hipster kinda way and do loads of drugs that keep them all as clueless as they are sober and how all the drugs make them all turn on each other (as if they cared about each other to begin with! well besides Popsicle boy) Oh and the nonchalant attitude when the girl, their friend dies in the beginning of the party....its like oops! lol Same attitude when everyone dies!

A total dark comedy!!! It took till the ending for all hell to break loose!!

Something very funny to me was the stunned expression on every one's face when someone actually showed up to their ""Murder Party"" and all the times they reminded each other not to use cell phones during a crime!

2916893,5,B000U6YJME,"Every single time I see a movie I really, really want to like it. I want it to be the next SLASHERS or NIGHT FEEDERS or FIDO. I want it to knock my metaphorical socks off and I want to go to my grave 30 years from now cherishing the memory of the day I saw it for the time! Yep, every single time. Even though I've been burned by OTIS and SEVERANCE and zillions of other ""horror comedies"" that everyone else liked but which left me cold, Still I approached MURDER PARTY with the same hopeful feeling that I was about to discover a gem, a diamond in the rough. Yeah. And you know what? I loved this little independent sucker to death!

The story centers around Christoper a pathetic loner(a milquetoast dominated even by his own cat, Sir Lancelot), who while walking home from the video store after work on Halloween happens upon an invitation to a party, a ""murder party""--at the bottom of the invitation are the ominous words ""come alone"". Intrigued by the invitation (and unable to encourage his cat to get off one chair in the living room) Christopher decides to break out of his shell. He locates the party's address on his computer, bakes some pumpkin bread, makes a knight's costume out of a cardboard box (after throwing out the perfectly good monster costume the box contained), and sets out for a night of fun. Or so he thinks.

The other party goers are; Lexi who's dressed as Priss from BLADE RUNNER, Macon in a werewolf mask, the obviously psychotic Bill as one of the baseball mimes from THE WARRIORS, Sky is the ubitquitous the cheerleader, and Paul who's doing the romantic 19th century vampire bit. And they are all quite surprised when Christopher shows up bearing gifts of pumpkin bread. They are simply stunned that anyone would be stupid enough to actually show up for something called a ""murder"" party, and before he knows it Christopher is bound and gagged and tied to a chair. It seems that they are all avant garde artists intent upon impressing someone named Alexander who has $300,000 worth of grant money to disperse, and what better way to do it than murder someone (guess who?) in an appropriately artistic manner. After they discuss various art concepts vis a vis Christopher's dead body, Sky pipes up. She isn't totally down with the murder thing and says she has an even better idea that won't involve killing anyone, but before she can divest herself of said idea she gets dizzy, falls on a handy pick axe sustains a fatal head wound, gets up and says ""Smells like cut grass"" and promptly falls over dead. (Wow, I didn't see that one coming!) It seems she had been eating the pumpkin bread and was allergic to the preservatives in the raisins. MURDER PARTY is full of surprises and that's one of the biggest selling points any movie can have in my book.

Originality, creativity, and a sense of humor (the Holy Trinity), all traits which are sadly lacking in mainstream films lately but which can still be found from time to time in low budget indies such as this. MURDER PARTY also has a tight, well written story with actual character development courtesy of Jeremy Saulnier who not only wrote and directed but also acted as executive producer AND director of photography in his spare time. That's a trademark of the indie, everybody is doing at least double duty; Paul Bartlett not only played Paul in the flick he was did the make up and special effects and everyone kicked in their own money to finance the film, it was completely self-produced. And its this kind of involvement in every level of the film's production that gives the indies their special sense of life--there's love and passion oozing out of every frame in flix like this. That's what makes them so irresistible. There's also some pretty good acting here too, with several actors deserving of special mention, among them; Chris Sharp as our hapless hero, William Lacey as the psychotic Bill, and Puff Snooty as Sir Lancelot the cat without whom they would have been unable to have filmed one of the best finales in motion picture history. Bravo Puff!

2916901,2,B000U6YJME,"Horror comedy is a tough act to pull off.  When it's done right it can be an incredibly enjoyable experience (Evil Dead 2, Dead Alive), unfortunately more often than naught instead of being entertained you'll more likely be left wondering how the film you just watched was ever able to make it to DVD to begin with (too many to name!).  Murder Party is the newest hybrid to attempt the unenviable task of making you smile, while at the same time making you cringe (like a bad Birthday present).  The story starts with the introduction of our main character Chris, who stumbles (literally) onto an invitation to a ""murder party"" on Halloween night... being a lovable loser with nothing better to do he decides to make a costume out of a cardboard box and head off to the party (just like anyone would right... right?!).  Turns out that it's a trap (go figure) set by a bunch of extremely obnoxious and unlikable art students who are planning a murder to impress fellow art enthusiast Alexander and his $300,000.00 art grant (no really).  Chris happens to be the unfortunate shlub who accepts the invite.  The begining of the movie is the best, introducing a likeable character in Chris and doing it with plenty of charm and even a few laugh out loud moments (the subway scene for instance).  Problem is that once he makes it to the party he's instantly tied up and gagged and the movie shifts to the aforementioned art students, who then spend a LOOOOONG time interacting amongst themselves and basically being the pretentious caricatures that the director wants them to come off as (which is why I don't know why they have so much screen time?).  Eventually a bloodbath does ensue (including a great chainsaw to the dome... Scarface style!), but it's likely not everyone who gives the movie a try will make it that far.  The actual film itself is fairly well done with some nice camera work, effects, and above average acting for such a low budget feature... the script and pacing on the other hand, not quite so good.  Murder party almost comes off as a personal jab at art students (just artists in general?) by writer/director Jeremy Saulner, possibly due to him witnessing it first hand himself or maybe they just seemed like an easy target, I don't know?  Those that share similiar feelings will probably find more to enjoy here but as for the rest of us (who don't know much about art or it's students)... we'll be left wondering how the film we just watched was ever able to make it to DVD to begin with?",1196553600,2,2511,4.620224719101124
2916902,3,B000U6YJME,"I was expecting too much when I purchased this flick. With a goofball on the cover holding chainsaws, and promises of 'horror/comedy', I was expecting an independent movie in the spirit and vibe of the Evil Dead movies. I was horribly wrong. Not to say this is a bad film or a complete waste of time, but with the effort that went into this, it could have been so much better.

A man in his forties tries to pull off a Napolean Dynamite character. He does OK in the film and is by far the most likeable character. He is a loner metermaid in NYC and plans to spend a quiet Halloween at home watching third rate horror videos with his cat. However fate steps in and he picks up an invitation off the sidewalk inviting him to a 'Murder Party'. So he makes a costume out of cardboard boxes and duct tape and goes to teh party as a medieval knight.

When he gets to the party he is immediately tied up by the hosts. Then there is a long, drawn out discussion on how to kill him in the name of 'art'. The one with the best idea and execution will get an art grant from Alexander. The film then has its ups and downs and drags at times. They play truth or dare with truth serum which really could have been entertaining, but it really wasn't.

Finally the killing starts and it really isn't that bad. The first death was shortly after metermaid showed up with some pumpkin bread. Unfortunately the ghoulish cheerleader is alergic to 'non-organic' raisins. She gets dizzy and crashes her head down on a pick-axe. We then have gunshots to the head, an axe to the head, a dude setting himself on fire, and a German Shepard gets high on crack cocaine and chews off his owners face.

Metermaid makes his escape with an Asian zombie dressed as a New York Yankee is in hot pursuit with an axe. The final kill is in an art studio with nude painted women. Asian man goes crazy ""Everybody Dies!"" he yells and chops them to pieces. Even the hottie with the pierced nipples. The tables turn when our hero defends himself as he retrieves an electric chainsaw that he pulls in from the window. You will have to watch the film to see how this happens. Asian man gets his face sawed in half quite nicely.

This is not going to become a cult classic. The kills were good for an indie flick, but there just were not enough jokes to keep the momentum up. If the blond with the blue stripe across her face showed some flesh, maybe it would have helped.",1195948800,,2425,4.286026200873362

Dressed in his cardboard armor costume with a pumpkin raisin bread loaf, he goes to the party without knowing what to expect. What he finds is a group of art school college students who tie him up and kill him for their art.

Murder Party is Jeremy Saulnier's very first, super low budget movie. It has impressive effects and unexpected humor. Christopher is an unimpressive, boring looking man who uncharacteristically decided to go to a random party. The art students didn't actually expect anyone to show up and don't have a clear plan about how to murder him. They are driven by the promise of an art grant by a rich patron named Alexander. Each of them thinks their art is superior to everyone else's and are actually deeply insecure. Most of the movie is their drama, their ineptitude, and weird party games, which are all pretty hilarious.

At first, the art students start dying due to unfortunate accidents and then later by killing each other. The most unlikely of them goes on a rampage killing the remaining ones and chasing Christopher through the city. One of the funniest moments is when a performance art installation in all white is turned into a bloodbath, people walk through and judge the piece as if it was intentional. Christopher navigates this unfamiliar world and in comparison shows how ridiculous the art community can be.

8212179,5,B000U6YJME,"A random invitation to a halloween party sparks a bloodbath of mishap, mayhem and hilarity. This was the only description that was given for this movie....allow ne to expand on it, this was great. We get a basic nobody who by accident gets and invite to a Halloween party which turns out that it is really a Murder party thrown by a bunch of bored art types who intend to kill him in some artsy way. Now, I have never heard of anyone at all in this movie but the performances were a lot of fun and the story never waivers at all just keeps moving forward. It has a bunch of twists and turns and really does get bloody and gory so be prepared. This comedy of errors is well worth watching as a low budget indie gem. Are there a few over the top performances....sure there are and that is okay because some over the top acting is needed here. Get it and have fun.",1507766400,,861,4.161676646706587

8212186,3,B000U6YJME,"they cut a birthday cake with an axe!  AN AXE! and then they got blood on it.  unacceptable. barbaric.  a cake knife is easy to remember simple enough--it has the word ""cake"" in it. and the blood?  it is not as if it can be wiped off after being smooshed by the axe, but once blood is on a cake, the entire cake has to be tossed.  it is better to not get blood on the cake to begin with, people should remember that. rude and unacceptable table manners make me very unsympathetic, except when i am at the dinner table, i would just say ""cake? no thank you"" as pointing out the lack of etiquette in others is bad for the digestion.",1483228800,,630,4.0894308943089435
