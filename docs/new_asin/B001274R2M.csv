8244334,5,B001274R2M,"Wonderful to see the late Jeff Ethel put the Warhawk through its paces. Enough technical details to satisfy the purist, yet not complicated to understand for the neophyte.",1367712000,,171,5.142857142857143
8244335,5,B001274R2M,"To date I have three Roaring Glory DVDs: TBM Avenger, F6F Hellcat and the B-25 Mitchell.
All are excellent productions. If you're looking for the traditional stale history of the F-6F you won't find it here, although some archival footage is added. The Roaring Glory series is a look at particular restored aircraft from a pilots viewpoint. And thats a good thing. The F-6F starts with the typical preflight walk-around with the narrator explaining what he is looking at and why. From here you're in the cockpit with the narrator explaining the various instruments and controls followed by an explanation of the startup procedures. Then its off to the practice area for some in-flight maneuvers (with narration) and excellent film footage. If you want to know what theF-6F was like from the inside out and how to fly it, this is a good DVD.",1366761600,,840,4.840277777777778
8244336,5,B001274R2M,"The late Jeff Ethell was a master at explaining the features and operation of World War Two War Birds, as only a highly skilled pilot can. He makes it sound simple, and one feels they are with him on each flight. It's an excellent rendition. I have every one of his Warbird series, they are all excellent.",1360368000,,305,4.368421052631579
8244337,4,B001274R2M,"I enjoyed the watching the walkaround and cockpit sequences. The audio was also definite plus. Hinton's fast historical synopses had a glaring flaw, The old Grumman factory was/is located in Long Island, New York, not New Jersey. Better, editing should have caught that error. Other than that, it is nice to able to watch a Hellcat fly.",1346025600,,336,4.912280701754386
