8314218,5,B001K3JRZA,"Am I Evil...  The title brings back memories of headbanging to Metallica in the early days when they still made good metal. I kind of had the same feeling with this film......Right away when the titles came up for this film I immediatly was brought back to the early 80's and the heyday for the classic slashers and indie direct to video nasties I used to flood my brains with during that glorious, bloody era.

As I am sure you all remember from that period it can be a double edged sword.....sure the memories are good but you try and go back to those films you loved in the 80's and realize they were really good memories, but films?.........not so much!

So does this film deliver on both fronts or is it just another indie film trying to take advantage of the resurgence of the 80's horror/slasher nostalgia?
The only film I can even compare this to is ""Henry: Portrait Of a Serial Killer"" and I may be going out on a limb here but this film will be uttered in the same breath as that horror classic. This is a film that takes all of the Freddys, Jasons, and Leatherfaces of the horror world and shows them the real meaning of true terror!  The director did a great job, by making this film a character study piece instead of a typical homicidal maniac film. The direction of the film was great.  An excellent aspect in the film comes from the special effects, with the concepts achieving success, mixed with exciting camerawork.  If your looking for total gratification in carnage and a messy slop, then you may as well look for a snuff film!  This movie is a good o'l throwback to the 80's with style and that is visually artistic!

""Am I Evil"" is a tight little film, definitely a worthy serial killer films to come out in a while!",1436054400,2,1739,4.395638629283489
8314219,2,B001K3JRZA,"I was led to believe this movie had real good cringe factor scenes. Well, I was not impressed at all. First, the movie was filmed in black and white. That alone reduces any cringe shock value, nothing like blood and gore without color! Second, most of the violent scenes, the camera did not show the dirty dead, but panned away and left things to your imagination. What little bloody gore violence that  was left for you to see was just not all that impressive! The dvd cover scene actually exists in this movie, however, when the killer finally gets to work, the viewer can only watch the girls calfs and feet. This was a waste of time in my book.",1435622400,3,648,4.4
8314220,3,B001K3JRZA,"""Am I Evil"" is an ambitious project by writer/director/cinematographer Richard Terrasi - wherein, I speculate, he may be attempting to provide the 'ultimate' serial killer flik.  After watching this indie offering (twice) I was reminded of a childhood 'experiment'  where I tried to create the 'ultimate' cleaning agent by mixing up bits of all of the different cleaning compounds I found under the sink - assuming the 'combined ingredients' would provide a superior product! Fortunately this naive chemistry experiment didn't blow up in my face, but it also didn't really provide a superior 'ultimate' product!

Film-maker hopeful Terrasi seems to have followed this same basic approach in concocting his (shot direct to video) psycho tale. The screenplay attempts to peer inside the mind of a brand new serial killer - who finally begins to 'act' upon his murderous sexual fantasies with some unfortunate local females. Borrowing heavily from just about every well known genre film and director (who he DOES give credit to in the end titles!) Terrasi  provides a literal check-list of misogynistic thrills and 'kills' that include: evisceration, necrophilia, castration, strangulation, rape, dismemberment, and cutting a girl in half w/ a chainsaw! Never a dull moment!  The evil serial protagonist (played fairly effectively by Mark Vazquez) uses his boyish good-looks and disarming personality to lure a variety of unassuming women into his diabolical lair. If this sounds 'familiar' it might be because it mirrors the modus of (real) serial killer Ted Bundy, and Terrasi's film bears some striking similarities to the video/film ""Ted Bundy"" (2002- Dir. Mathew Bright).  As the plot slogs forward thru numerous scenes of increasingly mean-spirited depredations against women, and displaying graphic evidence that Terrasi's ' gore make-up' oriented friends were having a great time creating gross-out vignettes of dismembered corpses to shock the audience - ironically, the shock value actually began to wane, and the viewer (like myself!) may begin to wonder: 'why' they are actually watching this mess.

For an inaugural directorial outing I'd say that Mr Terrasi definitely shows promise as a potential film maker - but he needs to learn that it takes more than just a layered on series of situations and images of viciously slaughtered dead girls to produce quality horror. It is an interesting psychological phenom that (some of) we humans are so fascinated by horror and gore (hey, I know I am!) and are attracted to stories/films that depict the mis-deeds of individudals who go off the deep end.  This film will potentially appeal to those who enjoy sick & twisted cinema - but itz definitely NOT one for the kiddies. Extras include some 'behind the scenes' featurette & stills.  The film is presented in a nice clean (digitalvideo) widescreen format.",1388361600,3,2862,5.286343612334802
8314221,5,B001K3JRZA,"In a nutshell, this one makes ""Silence of the Lambs"" look like child's play.  A true testament to the ingenuity of low budget horror films, ""Am I Evil"" is nothing but evil.  A deranged killer is obsessed with mutilating the women he makes love to.  It is sick...really sick...and I would not recommend this one to the squeamish.  This is director Richard Terrasi's first attempt (released in 2007) and he was awarded with the Best Director trophy at the Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival.  As far as I know, this is his only release even though there's a trailer on the DVD for a 2009 release of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Festival"".  I could not find it on Amazon or the IMDB.  If you're a true horror/gore fan, this one is for you.  Don't miss it.  The more I see films in this genre it makes me wonder how much further horror creators can go.  How far the twisted killer goes in this film may be the epitome.",1290902400,10,920,4.4226190476190474
