want mine?? email me.... this is trash !!!",1170028800,5,312,4.2
8133344,3,B000GL194Y,"First, the bad stuff. Some of the source film for this DVD is probably silent 8mm film, and it's almost 50 years old. It's grainy, poorly lit, and if the commentator didn't tell you which one was Lewis, you probably couldn't figure it out for yourself. The sound is terrible and muddy. The announcer repeatedly mispronounces opponent names. It sounds as though it may have been recorded in a coffee shop.

There are only pieces of fights here. The ones that could have been featured like Lewis vs Chuck Norris (3 matches) take up about 15 seconds. Joe's full contact kickboxing matches (one of which I saw on ESPN) are in good viewing shape, but aren't here) are absent except for a few scenes.

On the plus side, there is no where else to get this footage as far as I know. That gives the DVD a rarity factor. Lewis' genius is apparent, but it's rather like seeing the Mona Lisa piece by piece instead of as a full painting.

I don't know Joe Lewis' involvement if any in this VERY short (30 minutes, maybe!) project. Having seen his training dvd's and the quality there, I would guess probably none. The box says this DVD has Macrovision and is digitally mastered. It looks like a burned cd from someone's computer. At about $8.99, it would be a worthwhile purchase. At $29.95, it's a rip off.",1169683200,4,1295,4.502127659574468
