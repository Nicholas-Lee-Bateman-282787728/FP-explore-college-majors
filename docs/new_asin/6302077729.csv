421171,1,6302077729,"Microwave Massacre is even worse than it sounds. It is cheap, sleazy soft-core porn masquerading as horror comedy, starring Jackie Vernon as a construction worker who kills and eats his nagging wife, then goes on a cannibalistic rampage. The special effects make Ed Wood look like George Lucas, most of the acting makes Tor Johnson look like Anthony Hopkins, and the whole thing is unbearably long at 75 minutes. Its only point of interest--and its tragedy--is Vernon, a hilarious deadpan comedian and the TV voice of Frosty the Snowman. Vernon was bankrupt and penniless toward the end of his life, and desperate for any work he could get; Microwave Massacre demonstrates just how desperate he was. But there is one moment in the film when Vernon showed he still had what it took. In that scene, his wife screams at him from the other room to wipe his feet; Vernon, with a look of consummate disgust that would have done credit to Oliver Hardy, steps up on the sofa and wipes his feet on the cushions. There it is: not enough to recommend the movie, but enough to show how foolish Hollywood was to chew up and spit out a talent like Jackie Vernon.",1007164800,10,1148,4.632352941176471

421244,3,6302077729,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Im old enough to remember when MICROWAVE MASSACRE first made its way to video, yes VHS, years ago. I owned a video store at the time and horror films always rented well. When I saw the artwork for this one and read the description I laughed, ordered it and put it on the shelf for rental. I also watched the movie. Before it ended I wondered what I had been thinking when I ordered it. The movie was as bad if not worse than the title.

And yet in the passing years the movie has garnered a cult following among fans of bad movies. Those who revel in the worst film has to offer have found a gem to add to their collections. Seriously, the movie is terrible for so many reasons and yet its the sort of movie that you feel compelled to watch from start to finish. Its not one of those intentionally bad movies, it is one where those making it really thought they had something but the end result could not have been what they intended.

The story involved mild-mannered Donald (Jackie Vernon), a construction worker whose wife May is intent of elevating herself and Donald to a classier lifestyle. She displays no class in her decorating style, in her attitude, in how she talks and definitely not in the cuisine that she forces Donald to eat every day. A prime example is a crab sandwich that is, yes, an entire crab between two slices of bread.

After a night of drinking Donald goes home to find May has cooked some strange new concoction. In a drunken rage strangles May, killing her. When he wakes the next day he discovers what he has done and now must cover up the evidence. Cutting up her body he cooks it in Mays huge microwave and then wraps the pieces in tin foil. He stuffs the body parts into the freezer in the garage, not noticing that one piece has fallen into a garbage can he used to throw away the food May froze in the freezer. When he gets hungry later that night he takes that particular piece inside to eat and is surprised at how good it tastes. As he unwraps it while eating he discovers it is Mays hand. But since it tastes better than what hes been served lately he continues eating.

This leads to Donald finding other victims to kill, microwave and then eat. He also shares the food with his co-workers who enjoy it as well and suddenly become friendlier towards Donald. The body count rises and Donalds hunger is satiated. The movie ends rather abruptly, or should I say mercifully. And lucky for us it didn't end with anything that looked like a sequel could happen.

So much is bad about this movie. The sets seem like they actually filmed it in someones house, which if you watch the extras you discover they did. Jackie Vernon shows why he was a great stand-up comedian and a lousy actor. Not only does he display no range of emotion he cant even show surprise and make it believable. The rest of the actors fare better but not much. The cinematography is low level at best. The props are recognizable but unrealistic. As I look back I find nothing that works or is well done here.

And yet the movie has a certain charm for fans of really bad films. You get the impression that the people behind it were really trying to make something but didn't possess the skill or talent to pull it off. When you watch the extras you get a glimpse into those people and what they thought about the movie they were making at the time.

Arrow Video has once again saved a cult film from disappearing forever and you have to give them credit for doing so no matter how bad the movie is. This is the kind of movie that you put on during a party and have a good laugh over. What is mind numbing is to think that this movie was given a 2k restoration by Arrow. In addition to that it includes a brand new audio commentary track with writer-producer Craig Muckler moderated by Mike Tristano and a brand new making of featurette that includes interviews with Muckler, director Wayne Berwick and actor Loren Schein. Its important to note that the featurette is more entertaining than the film itself. But fans can rejoice that its now being offered in this pristine version. If bad movies make you laugh, make you smile or make you appreciate good movies just that much more than by all means you need to watch this film. And thank Arrow while you're at it for delivering it to your door.

Before being asked why I would give something this bad 3 stars let me say that I did so for two reasons. The first is the incredible job of making this movie look better than it is by Arrow Video. The second is that while I found it so bad that I don't want to watch it again I know there are some that will absolutely love the camp and bad movie aspects of the movie. For those people, enjoy and have fun.",1473811200,,4764,4.331838565022421

421247,3,6302077729,"Stand-up comedian Jackie Cooper may have performed in thousands of nightclubs across the country and appeared on dozens of late-night talk shows, including regular gigs on Ed Sullivan and The Tonight Show, but if today's generation knows him at all it's as the voice of Frosty the Snowman in a series of Rankin Bass holiday specials.  His signature soft-spoken delivery and self-deprecating style were a perfect fit for the lovable cartoon character.  That's why it's almost sacrilegious to hear him spout lines like, ""I'm so hungry, I could eat a whore!"" in 1983's Microwave Massacre, a spoofy cannibal comedy built around Cooper's corny sense of humor and copious T & A horror clichs.

Shot in the late '70s but released five years later, the script was originally written with Rodney Dangerfield in mind, which probably would have provided a bit more bite (sorry, I'm just preparing you).  But as it stands, Microwave Massacre is an alternate universe anomaly:  unevenly blending Borscht Belt punch lines and teenage sex romps.

Donald (Vernon) is a construction worker who dreads going home to his wife's experimental cuisine, which is prepared in their new pinball-sized microwave oven.  Finally, after a late-night bender, he drunkenly disposes of her once and for all, discovering her remains in the new-fangled appliance.  Recovering from the initial shock, Donald accidentally eats a few bites of his late wife...and decides it's not so bad!

His ""special"" sandwiches are a big hit back at work, but when his sexual appetite begins to recover too, Donald finds that he's only satisfied by turning his latest conquest into a meal.  Soon, his refrigerator is stuffed with body parts that threaten to expose his secret recipe.

If you're getting the idea that this horror hybrid is one hot mess, pat yourself on the back.  But nostalgia for these VHS-era disasters has gone through the roof.  And there's a certain sick gratification in seeing just how bad a movie could be and still wind up on a video store shelf.  Director Wayne Berwick's film is far from the worst; in fact, there's a David Lynchian-charm to the sitcom-style sets and ""Take my wife...please!"" dialogue.  Ultimately, Microwave Massacre exists in that bizarre niche of movies that just shouldn't exist, but have somehow gone on to secondary cult celebrity status.

And Arrow Video comes through again with a great-looking 2-disc special edition Blu-ray / DVD set.  Even the filmmaker's themselves can hardly believe it exists!  Extra include a 20-minute or so Making Of with Berwick and his collaborators commenting on the usual challenges and camaraderie.  Things get more detailed on the audio commentary, which goes along with a fully illustrated collector's booklet and reversible sleeve.",1471996800,,2767,5.149888143176733

Microwave Massacre:

Have you ever wondered what happened to Frosty the Snowman after the movie ended? Well, now you can finally have that lifelong mystery answered with the new Arrow Video Blu-ray release of the ""cult classic"" Microwave Massacre! If you're confused as ****, read on!

Movie Review:

Frosty has now apparently transformed from a snowman into a middle-aged man in a dead end relationship. He wakes up every day and heads to his construction job where everyone stands around with hard hats on and holding shovels (hey, just like real government work!) His miserable day is topped off when he opens up his lunch and sees yet another ""gourmet"" meal from his equally miserable wife. However, maybe things will change now that his wife has bought a fancy new microwave.

Things to do change, but not in the way he was hoping. Meals are still just as weird and foreign as can be and he is at his breaking point. Frosty decides to end it all and kill his wife with a salt grinder. His wife ends up in the new fancy microwave and is set to slow roasted, but you can't leave evidence around like that, can you? No, no you can't. Frosty decides through a simple mistake of confusing  actual meat with a fried hand, to become a cannibal. He is going to eat the rest of the evidence and share with his friends at work, who also love the taste. The perfect plan!

The meats tough, though, so he realises he needs to go for some younger, fresher meat. Frosty puts on the charm we all love and hooks up with several working class ladies of the evening and makes dinner plans with them. If you ever wanted to know what Frosty would sound like having sex, this movie is for you!

Let's get one thing straight. Microwave Massacre is a terrible film. It feels like you're watching a badly written porn without the lower body nudity-don't worry, there is plenty of boobs to throw around. Save for Frosty himself, Jackie Vernon-who's actual name in the movie is Donald-everyone is completely over the top in their acting. Jackie Vernon is the only person to play the role like he is acting in an Oscar-worthy flick.

The script was originally meant to be more of a horror film, but the end result was a slapstick, comedy fest of gags and jokes that missed the mark by a mile. Yet, why was I smiling throughout the 76-minute runtime? I mean, I know the movie is awful, yet I couldn't help enjoy it. Is there something wrong with me? Maybe it's the charm of the movie that won me over or maybe it's the generous helping of boobies. Yeah, definitely the boobies.

Raise your hand if you like downright bad horror movies. If you are reaching for the sky like I am, you can rest easy in knowing you'll get a kick out of this trashy, low budget schlock.

Blu-ray Opinion:

Now that you know what Microwave Massacre is all about, you're probably wondering whether the Blu-ray is worth it. Well, Arrow Video isn't normally a company to slouch on their releases, even if the movie is Microwave Massacre. Once again, they come through with a solid presentation of cleaned up video and audio that only had a few areas of noticeable distortion. The distortion will not distract from this jaw-dropping experience one bit.

As for the special features, the film is rocking a 21-minute interview with director Wayne Berwick, producer Craig Muckler and actor Loren Schein. They reminisce about the history of the film and how they came together as a family to make a flick that didn't end up being anything like they imagined it would be. Also included is a trailer, gallery and audio commentary with producer Craig Muckler.

Speaking of the commentary, the menus have it listed as being with director Wayne Berwick, but that is, in fact, false. The actual commentary is listed on the back cover of the Blu, which is with Muckler and moderated by Mike Tristano. Would a commentary with the director been cool? Sure, but the one we get with Muckler is filled with plenty of info to keep you filled up.

Verdict

Microwave Massacre is a movie that can't easily be rated on a one to ten scale. I mean, come on, it's terrible. However, like most bad horror movies that have a hidden charm, it's fun to watch. Adding to the fun is a damn solid Blu-ray from Arrow Video. I'll leave the decision as to whether you should buy up to you, but if you ask me, I think it's worth picking up just for the experience of seeing Frosty boink a hooker. Childhood ruined!",1471478400,2,4531,4.547911547911548
421269,5,6302077729,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I was very excited to hear Arrow and MVD were teaming up to release MICROWAVE MASSACRE.  This is another one of those films I had heard about for years, but never found it on VHS (or DVD for that matter) to watch.  Im happy to report the film is just as much fun as I hoped it would be.  Full of quirky humor, abysmal special effects, and some of the finest cardboard acting youll ever see, MICROWAVE MASSACRE is a B-Horror Movie fans dream!

This is definitely one of those so-bad-its-good films, so don't expect anything less going into it.  But sit back and prepare to be entertainedthis is a film I guarantee youll watch more than once.

MICROWAVE MASSACRE is shot plainly but efficiently.  Theres no outstanding cinematography; the camera is just there to capture the story.  This is not a negative at all, but I don't want any viewers setting their expectations high in the production department.  Likewise, the production value appears very low.  I would wager the biggest expense this film incurred was on catering for the cast and crew.

The acting is atrocious, but its also a big part of what makes this movie so much fun.  Comedian/actor Jackie Vernon gives a slooooooow-going performance as the main character, Donald.  The snail-speed delivery of his lines made me want to finish them for him in many cases.  But I couldn't keep from laughing as well.  His every man persona fit perfectly for the character; I don't think I could see anybody else playing that role.

The gore in MICROWAVE MASSACRE is cheesy but effective.  I particularly enjoyed the decomposing (supposedly) head of Donalds wife that he keeps in the freezer.  It looks somewhat realistic, but its certainly creepy nonetheless!

A DVD copy of this film touts it as the worst horror movie ever made, and while I would argue that, its certainly up there with the-best-of-the-worst.  And that is definitely a good thing.  MICROWAVE MASSACRE will make an excellent addition to your horror library, and it will provide numerous hours of fun.  This is one of those films you want to watch with a group of friends, just so everybody can pick it apart. The film hits stores tomorrow, so make a note!",1471219200,,2245,4.7
421270,4,6302077729,"If John Waters' name appeared in the credits, this film would be hailed as a work of genius.  In its own strange way, it's as campy as a John Waters film, with more laughs and higher production values.  And it's wonderfully WEIRD -- like being on some sort of mildly psychedelic drug that renders everything in a delicious slow motion.  Star Jackie Vernon was famous for his deadpan delivery, but this film goes beyond deadpan into all new territories of surrealism.  The jokes are juvenile and the cannibalism is gross, to be sure, but there's a peculiar wholesomeness underlying everything.  The film isn't mean-spirited or depraved, as bizarre as that is in itself.  Vernon's character isn't a maniac -- all he wanted out of life was a bologna sandwich, and events simply developed from there.  The crude jokes are easy to enumerate, but it's the stranger, more idiosyncratic humor that really makes the film and generates the biggest laughs.  For every easy gag involving ample bosom-shaped holes in a construction site wall, there's subtler humor that's wholly original.  For example, there's a long-running gag about excruciatingly pronounced French words, tying into the tacky frozen cuisine that Vernon's wife is obsessed with, and culminating with a bizarre French street performer in a Big Bird costume.  It doesn't really translate on the written page, but as part of the tapestry of the film, it's hilarious.  Then there's a murder witnessed by a plaster bust of Beethoven.  There's that moment when a hooker asks Vernon whether they should start with French or Greek, and Vernon answers that he's more into Japanese and Yugoslavian.  There's the drowsy psychiatrist who swats flies in his sleep as Vernon confesses his murders, then wakes up to reassure Vernon that ""eating a woman"" can be a very beautiful act.  And there's the moment when Vernon hefts with difficulty a fresh corpse onto a chopping block and mutters to himself that THIS is why he'd been celibate for 15 years.  The film is often hailed as the worst ever made and an example of schlock, but if only trashy movies were always THIS inspired.",1471219200,5,2121,4.9352112676056334

This film wanted to be horror one minute and comedy the next, but it never felt like the two meshed the way it was intended to. The print I got, the picture was good. I mean, the last time I remember seeing this film was on beta max when I was 13. Plus, when it comes to Arrow, they are to horror releases what Criterion are to dramas. You always know for the money, you will get a good print. The special features are a little lacking, I tried to do the audio commentary and it seemed off at times, like the conversation was lost.

In fact, the microwave ""taste"" is so perfect, it's a big hit with his construction worker buddies, when they're not watching a naughty random blonde poking her mammary glands through curiously convenient holes in a nearby fence that is.

Soon, he runs out of wife sandwiches, and has to lure other unsuspecting young lasses into his home to replenish the stock.  Apparently there are some real hot, fit, young sex maniacs looking for dates where he lives. But the microwave cookin's so good, he can't resist opting for human sandwiches instead.

Ingredients to a fun horror/comedy(completely comedy, actually): silly puns, a giant microwave the size of a conventional oven, construction workers who eat bad lunches and also have silly puns and bad pick-up lines, a chick with big boobs who shows them through a wall with cut-outs designed for boobs--imagine that!--bad eighties clothes, edible hookers, edible chick in a chicken constume, cheesy soundtrack, a scene where a human body is put between two huge pieces of bread with mayonaise, and much more.

This movie can't be categorized, and that's what makes it such an oddball movie.  It's funny if you like really dark humor.  It's not hack and slash, though there's fake body props throughout.

If you want an enjoyable laugh along the lines of ""Frankenhooker"" without the budget, then check this one out.  And ""MM"" is subtle funny like ""Blood Feast 2,"" but not nearly as gory.

This movie so funny despite it being so bad! Jackie Vernon who was also the voice actor for ""Frostie the Snowman"" is very memorable in this classic B-rated horror flick. Glad to hear it's coming out on DVD because I lost my VHS copy of it. In a nutshell the movie is about a hard luck, construction worker with a very displeasing wife who finally pushes him over the edge to murder and the discovery of canabilism. He brings his wife's dead meat to his construction worker pals for lunch & they like it with mixed results. Later he continues to murder more victims for their flesh (mostly very attractive females) and he continues to get more praise from his construction pals for the great tasting meat that continues to get tastier. I'ts humorous to see him re-arrange his overcrowded frige of dead meat with his wife's head that he keeps for sentimental reasons. The canabilism novelty in this movie is a little sick but overall the movie is pretty funny. Very sexy women with some gratuditious nudity to keep the guys amused. Might be more difficult for women to enjoy this movie. A 1 star movie, but I always have a 4 star time watching it. Recommended for comedy, cult horror fans!",1141603200,9,1367,5.1855203619909505

Our cannibalistic hero fights with his wife like cats and dogs throughout the movie.  However, he soon learns that the taste of human flesh can take his mind off just about anything.  Politically incorrect and tongue-in-cheek jokes make this worth your time:  the killer murders and eats an African-American, then comments how he likes the taste of dark meat.
It's been over ten years since I've seen this movie, but I will never forget the scene involving the drive-thru line at a fast-food restaurant.  The killer places his order by telling the employee to stick out her tongue, hike up her skirt, unbutton her blouse, and a Coke.  When he drives around to the window, she has actually done all of these things!  This obviously is best appreciated under the unfluence of a beer or twelve.  Recommended for B-horror junkies.

Even the end credits are a joke! The crew is listed as mock French menu items and it is deliciously clever. Speaking of delicious being used as an adjective, if you love puns, you will love this movie! Every single joke is delivered with dead pan humor and 85% of them are puns. Some bad, some good, all are incredible.

I would say the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the acting. Yeah, it's supposed to be ""bad"" but most of these actors... well... can't act at all, even in a purposefully bad way. Most of the time the bad acting works but there are times where it makes the film feel tedious. There is only one guy in the movie (the sleazy co-worker, and a few bit part actors) who obviously understands what acting is but everyone else seems like they were friends of the director and were given lines on each day of shooting. Everyone talks like robots slowly learning to read. Again, often times it works with the script but it's bad-bad, not good-bad. The lead actor especially is really, really awful. He delivers each line with the same cadence and I don't think he understood a single joke he makes. However, I think the script elevates the dialog no matter how it's delivered but If you can't stand bad acting, don't watch this!",1525219200,,1418,4.412213740458015

No, this isn't horror.  ""Microwave Massacre"" is supposed to be a comedy with a little blood and nudity...but they skimped on the comedy.  Like low-end pornography without the porn.  About the same level of writing, acting, directing and cinematography as cheesy porn.

Donald is a middle-aged construction worker who feels trapped in a marriage to his compulsive-housekeeper wife May, and they haven't had sex in 15 years.  Donald finally snaps one night, beats May to death with a salt-grinder and later chops her up for the deep freeze.  After accidentally ingesting a few bites of May's arm, Donald finds that he has a taste for human flesh; he then goes on a dismal spree of bringing women home for sex and then dismembering them for the freezer.

And so on.

It's too lame to be horror and too badly-written to be comedy, so it drifts in the nether-realm of bad movies that are amused with themselves, but that leave the audience cold, so to speak.

The enormous microwave prop plays almost no part in the story, aside from a couple of significant shots, so the title of the film is more than a little misleading, too.",1524960000,,1309,4.829596412556054

Additionally, a new 20 minute documentary and a commentary track are among the extras. There are brand new blockbusters released by much larger distributors that don't receive this kind of treatment. Arrow handles their presentation of even the biggest schlock fest like a ""Citizen Kane"".

As for the film, it's a perfect example of a ""B"" movie. Jackie Vernon, best known as Frosty the Snowman (the voice from the animated classic), plays the character performing the massacre with said microwave. His deadpan performance alone is worth watching, as it is endearing and creepy in equal measures. When Mr. Vernon isn't doing his shtick, the director relies on campy gore or excessive nudity to retain viewer interest. Basically, a movie like this wouldn't be allowed to be made today; and, that's a tragedy. Which is why companies like Arrow are so important, as they preserve these lost art gems for future film fans!

Donald goes through life in a state of perpetual, marital gloom. May has just had a brand new microwave installed, which is roughly the size of an industrial heating unit! All Donald wants is a decent meal, consisting of real food, instead of the experimental cuisine provided by May. Having reached his limit, Donald gets drunk and cuts loose the ball and chain!
