1245780,1,B00001O2G9,"I had high hopes for this DVD, as several people had posted favorable reviews of it. Indeed, it is well sung, and the orchestra sounds great. However, this is simply the most irritating staging of an opera that I've  seen in my life. There is never a moment, and I mean NEVER, when there  aren't hundreds of extras flitting about like idiots. It becomes impossible  to listen to the opera. One would be tempted to listen to the DVD with the  picture off, but all those people running around make a great deal of  noise, and their stomping frequently drowns out the music. It is an  incredible display of directorial self-indulgence! Dario Fo is the  director, and If I ever meet him, I'm going to slap him as hard as I can.",952387200,53,723,4.431818181818182
1245781,1,B00001O2G9,"While a fine opera, the sound was terrible.  Too much scuffling of feet and many times the voices were drowned out by the orchestra.",950054400,4,132,4.5
1245782,5,B00001O2G9,"Wow!  I have over 100 recordings of opera on commercial vhs, but this was the first opera I have ever bought on DVD and boy am I glad that this was  the choice.  The picture is stunning in quality and the sound brilliant in  clarity, crispness, and warmth.  The score is performed brilliantly at the  hands of Zedda, a Rossini expert, and I was left with nothing but tears of  happiness after listening to this recording!  A great value for those  looking for operatic pleasure at its finest!!",941241600,34,493,4.511363636363637
1245783,4,B00001O2G9,"If you like Commedia del Arte, this is an opera for you. Dario Fo makes it impossible not to enjoy it. On stage there happens so much and sometimes so  funny that you nearly forget to listen to the opera",941241600,16,203,4.075
1245784,5,B00001O2G9,"In general I don't like performances which add lots of people on stage when the libretto does not call for it.  But in this case I am more than willing to make an exception.  The set, to begin with, is stunning.  When first seen it represents the usual street in Seville.  To effect the scene change various parts of the set (on wheels) are pushed around to form Dr. Bartolo's home.  When any scene change is needed parts of the set are shifted around to form the next location.  And at each turn the set is extremely attractive.  A real piece of set design genius.

The stage direction is busier than I like but the total effect is so positive that it can be overlooked.  All the singers are attractive and totally at home with their roles.  Rossina is sung by Jennifer Larmore.  No need to imagine that she is beautiful because she is. And she sings well with lovely tone and clean coloratura.  Croft as Almaviva is a bit underpowered but he shows a real flair for comedy and certainly sings the notes.  Bartolo looks like an old man but he does not sound like one.  Even Berta, usually an also-ran role, is sung by a woman with a terrific voice.  For me Figaro himself is not that impressive vocally but he is at ease with his role and fulfills what is needed.  The big surprise for me was to hear Renato Capecchi in the role of the music teacher.  This is a voice that I have admired for years on CD but I never saw him in performance

This 1992 performance left me with a wonderful joyous feeling.  If any wanted to introduce opera to a novice, young or old, they could do no better than to call upon this performance to fill the bill.  There are other worthy performances of this chessnut out there but the stunning set gives this one a decided edge.",1378512000,,1756,4.3119266055045875

1245786,5,B00001O2G9,I've always wanted to see The Barber of Seville and never got a chance to see it on stage or otherwise. Really enjoyed it along with the music and singing. It was a great buy and I'm very pleased with it.,1361059200,,204,4.0
1245787,4,B00001O2G9,"Refreshing to hear a mezzo-soprano sing a leading role in an opera!  The opera is well-known and charming, with different but clever staging.  The singing is very good.",1356652800,,168,4.964285714285714
1245788,5,B00001O2G9,I am with the group of people who love this opera. It is thoroughly entertaining and original and the singing is very good. This is Richard Croft before he became Ghandi.,1319587200,,170,4.516129032258065
1245789,5,B00001O2G9,"The first star is Dario Fo's boisterous and brilliant theater.(*1) It  adds a new dimension to this masterpiece. Fo employs, among others, comedic methods of commedia dell'arte, originally a type of improvised Italian street entertainment using masks, exaggerate costumes and traditional songs. A strong warning though: If your preference goes to traditional stand-and-sing staging, you will likely be disturbed by Fo's brilliance. As Amazon's McLellan puts it:

'He gives the solo singers a crowd of artfully choreographed silent partners (including acrobats, dancers, and two men rigged to imitate a donkey), who scamper around the stage carrying ladders and sheets, pushing platforms, waving banners, and making sure that there is always something to amuse the eyes as well as the ears. This staging gives a solid visual embodiment to the comic spirit of the words and music, but it wipes out any pretense of dramatic realism.'

The second brilliant star is Jennifer Larmore's truly amazing Rossina! Judging from this perfomance, Larmore could be the best Rossini (coloratura) mezzo since Marilyn Horne. For what my ears' worth, she outshines Cecilia Bartoli (in Schwetzingen Festival) and Joyce DiDonato (in ROH), to name 2 favorites, in their *DVD performances*. Even though the role of Rossina does not require an extremely wide range, one can hear that Larmore has very wide and *even* vocal range, superbly agile coloratura technique, and a beautiful voice to match. She is also a charming actress. Besides being an Rossini/bel canto mezzo, Larmore is known as a remarkable Handelian (trouser-role) singer, as documented in her award-winning portrait of Cesare in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-Giulio-Cesare-Jacobs/dp/B000027O71/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel - Giulio Cesare / Jacobs</a>, probably the best sung Cesare I've heard. I wonder why she isn't much, much more popular.(*2)

As for other singers, Richard Croft's Count Almaviva is very good, but he faces incomparable Juan Diego Flrez in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROH-Production/dp/B0039I1HN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROH Production</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teatro-Real-Production/dp/B000BAQ8A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teatro Real Production</a>. David Malis's Figaro is good too, but probably not one for ages.(*4) Alberto Zedda's music direction is a small disappointment, especially considering the fact that he is regarded as a ""Rossini expert"". Compared with other recordings I have, for example by Antonio Pappano (in the ROH production) or by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alceo-Galliera/dp/B000002RY1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alceo Galliera</a>, this is a heavy-handed conduction which loses some of the Rossinian charm.

This might not be a DVD for everyone. For an all-rounded and better ""balanced"" performance, there are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Met-production/dp/B000787X00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Met production</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROH-Production/dp/B0039I1HN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROH Production</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schwetzingen-Festival-production/dp/B00009MGK3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schwetzingen Festival production</a>, to name 3. However, if you have eyes for theater, and ears for (mezzo) voice, this is not to be missed. For any Rossini fan, this is a must-buy for Larmore's singing alone.

This DVD is a recorded performance, staged in DNO (Netherlands Opera) in 1992 on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Rossini's birth.

There are currently two versions of this performance available:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Image-Entertainment-Edition/dp/B00001O2G9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Image Entertainment Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kultur-Edition/dp/B002KLPB0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kultur Edition</a>. Be sure to go for the Image Entertainment DVD which has the uncompressed LPCM sound track. The Kultur DVD with only compressed Dolby Digital 2.0 audio (ouch!) sounds flat next to the Image Entertainment DVD. It's in the full-screen (4:3) format and neither has any booklet introduction.

Highly recommended.

P.S. Did I say 2 stars while marking 5? Yes, but 2 superstars are worth more than 5 Amazon stars!

(*1) Dario Fo (born March 24, 1926) is an Italian satirist, playwright, theater director, actor, and composer.... He was awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature, with the committee highlighting him as a writer ""who emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden"". -- From Wikipedia.

(*2) For many people, Larmore is known to have sung in the closing ceremony of the 1996 summer olympics at Atlanta, where she is a native.

(*3) Interestingly,  all 3 leading roles in this production are performed by Americans. (Really, I'd love to see more fine American productions in DVDs. But with the current level of public support of fine arts, this is a pipe dream.)",1302912000,5,5744,7.118980169971671
1245790,5,B00001O2G9,"The singers in this production are not only wonderful but they are miracle-workers as well, with all the perpetual ""Comedia del Arte"" action going on as they overcome the frenzy and deliver top-notch performances in spite of it. The constant manipulation of drapery in every scene was a bit distracting, but the singing and acting were so good that I still thoroughly enjoyed the opera. The orchestra is great, too, and the filming is excellent. Buy this DVD. It's worth the price.",1149811200,3,481,4.878048780487805
1245791,1,B00001O2G9,"This production very disappointing -- vastly inferior to to the Nucci-Battle-Dara performance!

Bring in a ""famous director"" and you ruin the work.",1109030400,2,147,5.681818181818182
1245792,4,B00001O2G9,"While Dario Fo has gone overboard - populating every square inch of the set with extras and stage business - this remains, overall, a ""fun"" Barbiere.

Richard Croft should win an award for execution of all his stage pranks and physical demands while having to sing Almaviva's difficult music.  ""All'idea di quel metall"" is one of the most eye-popping messes I've seen a tenor have to go through; racing up and down a flight of steps that is being wheeled around the stage in constant motion as houses appear and disappear around him, it really is a bit much.  Croft never misses a beat and looks to enjoy the athletic aspects of the role Fo has laid out for him.  This Almaviva is a perfect blend of arrogant machismo, comic timing, physical agility - like Errol Flynn with high notes.

Beautiful Jennifer Larmore is not given particularly exciting costuming here, but she too exercises all of the business Fo foists on her as well.  Una voce poca fa is thrilling singing but the sideshow with her ladies in waiting is a bit much.

I wanted to like David Malis more as Figaro: a terrific actor, lithe and willing to risk life and limb, but the voice isn't quite right for Figaro:  his coloratura work is all delivered in an aspirated manner, most noticeable in the Rosina/Figaro ""Dunque il son"" where Larmore's ability to sing it smoothly makes his aspirated runs sound choppy and out of tune.

After repeated viewings I've found fewer problems with this production and the Act I finale is absolutely mind boggling - impossible to top and produces a riotous ovation from the audience who have all been lathered up into a frenzy.  Great fun!!!",1095984000,11,1642,4.670138888888889
1245793,3,B00001O2G9,"The visually stunning and aurally magnificent production of this classic opera is impeded horrendously by the sound quality on this video, due, I suppose, to poor microphone placement and bad editing. Footsteps (and especially leaps or backflips or other acrobatics) on stage become massive, booming cannon blasts that jar the music. The orchestra often drowns out the singers, especially during the second act. I would recommend purchasing this production if you can find a good price, and especially if you have a predilection for good stage direction and excellent singing.",1089676800,5,576,5.411111111111111
1245794,5,B00001O2G9,"This is the fifth opera I've seen on DVD, all of which I rented. This one, however, is the first to so enthrall me that I immediately purchased a copy of my own. I, like other reviewers, found the simple set but constant activity exciting, greatly entertaining, and a wonderful addition to the opera itself. The Barber of Seville is a comic opera, and Dario Fo emphasizes this with action, costumes, and even subtle slapstick. I agree it's not a traditional opera production, but the magnificent performaces by all make it wonderfully entertaining and worth seeing many times.",1080950400,6,576,4.887755102040816
1245795,5,B00001O2G9,"The first video Barber of Seville I saw was a VHS with Cecilia Bartoli. So I was scared off by some of the reviews below. Having watched it, I agree with another review: the negative reviews are unfair.
True, early on the movements are distracting and there are moments where the crowd noise is a problem. But like any good drama, this staging draws you in. After the first scene or so, the extra action really adds to the production. If you like a static production where the singers just stand around and sing, then, no, you won't like this one. But if you like action that creates a grand spectacle, than you will experience this production more positively. On the whole, it works. I'm no expert in operatic historiography, but this production FEELS right for the genre.
I'm also no expert in singing, but the music in this production sounds fine to me.
As with ""sinyung"" I'm giving this 5 stars since it is ""so much fun."" I burst out laughing numerous times. Isn't that what a great comedy is to do? Yes, there are occasional flaws, but they are more than outweighed by the positive aspects.",1048550400,17,1095,4.5353535353535355
1245796,3,B00001O2G9,Certainly not the classic production.  I find that the clowns and use of large cloth ribbons is too much of a distraction.  Also there is too much stage noise to enjoy the music.  This one is not for me.,1040947200,6,203,4.153846153846154
1245797,5,B00001O2G9,"Video of a bunch of people on a stage singing can get boring--
NOT HERE ! DARIO FO EXCITES THE STAGE with live acting; AND
actually brings it closer to THE TRUE VERSION of the comic opera
Rossini intended. The Italian clowns interact with the performance and truely enhance it. The singing of Figaro's
""Largo al factotum"" is the best ever recorded ! The singing
of the whole opera has an unusual LIFE to it, AND actually
sounds amazingly like the spirit of Rossini himself was inspiring
everyone ! Alberto Zedda conducts the orchestra in such a manner that it seems to have an amazing insight into the music.
Even the Overture is performed in a way I noticed certain tonalities I never noticed before. The balance between orchestra
and singer is so amazing you wonder if they aren't actually
communicating telepathically. Even the added actors must have memorized every note, and carefully planned each movement.
The recording is loud and clear --excellent !
IT IS MORE FUNNY THAN THE BUGS BUNNY VERSION-- AND
MORE TRUE TO ROSSINI THAN ANY OTHER VERSION.
I almost wonder if Salvador Dali inspired some scenes ?

1245798,3,B00001O2G9,"To be honest it is the hard to judge this production, just because in some degree it is not opera production. Opera production supposes to bring your attention to singing and staging and concentrate as close as possible. As you can see the opinion regarding this one are polarized so to be fair with it I will submit what I like and dislike with it.
I do like.
1. The performers are young and pretty. Ladies are pretty!!! Some are so pretty that I thought to ask for phone number.  Rosita is beautiful and I can believe than this man fall in love.
2. The singing quality is good but it would have been much better if nothing will distract.
3. Here's much of fantasy and refreshment, the action and tries to keep you in a good mood. There ARE some very nice moves that I never saw before and they work as intended.
4.  Figaro is cool; he is artful, foxy and convincing.
5. Overall idea is good and if it will be fixed may be very enjoyable.
I dislike.
1. Terrible stage noises. Sometimes they are so terrible that ruin the singing and music. Most of the noises produce by clown staff and most of them are not necessary. Especially distracting is the balls failing in the end of Figaro's song. It had sounds terrible. Really, I'm just wondering did the stage director have heard it before or he got his copy just like me from Amazon? By the way, have you tried to manipulate with 3 balls while you sing the Figaro's song? I hardly recommend to stage director to try, may be that will help to realize to him that it is not something that helps to sing and perform better. I don't know, may be some personal revenge took place, but it seem like stage director hopes to see the singers failing into the orchestra? What are the other reasons might be to non-stop moves of performers on the flimsy and noisy constructions?
2.  Use the curtain, please! It is pain to see at people of technical staff trying with terrible noises to move huge pieces of stage decorations and sometimes fail to arrange them firmly from the first try. The best stage productions of MET, Alla Scala, Lyric Opera, CG, etc are use the curtain. BTW it makes some logic points.
3. Could somebody of opera team just kill this one who performs Dr Bartolo? If this will be done on stage in the middle of performance you will hear the unbelievable applauses. I have tried to understand what kind of voice does he has. Once he sounds bass, once baritone, and once lyric tenor. Only at the end of the performance I realized that he probably had the good one 20 years before or the main performer got cold and this one is substitute wardrobe's guy who likes the opera very much.",1032825600,4,2637,4.3885480572597135
1245799,5,B00001O2G9,"I wouldn't say this production of ""the Barber"" was perfect, but I give 5 stars anyway because it was SO MUCH FUN! I've seen a convention production of ""the Barber"" live which was very well-sung and well-staged-- but the fact is, my attention always wavered after the second or third da capo of each verse or coloratura....
So even with the vibrant and often stunning vocal performances from Larmore, Croft, Malis and the rest of the cast (right down to Bertha the maid), what really sealed the COMIC SPIRIT of Rossini in this productions is the ""frivolous"" direction by Dario Fo. Count Almaviva is no longer stuck under Rosina's balcony when serenading Rosina, Rosina and Figaro are really ""playing around"" with each other in their duets, and everyone is just having fun with the opera.
Yes, watching this production finally made me appreciate Rossini's genius in creating the consistently over-the-top comedy in ""the Barber"". So THREE CHEERS to Dario Fo for coming up with the imaginative mimes to supplement Rossini' wonderful music! In particular, I thought the ""subtitling"" of the arias was a wonderful tip of the hat to the karaoke culture of today.
Of course, I must admit that unlike some opera-lovers, I DON'T have a problem with ""stylised"" as opposed to realistic staging of operas. Instead getting annoyed with an unusual way of staging an opera, I would try to see the ""point"" in such a staging. SO SIT BACK AND RELAX! The way to enjoy this production is to try to catch all the jokes and humour in the staging!",1018137600,8,1522,4.7908745247148286
1245800,4,B00001O2G9,"This disc is a well executed performance of Il Barbiere. The singing is of a very high quality throughout. Jennifer Larmore is simply fabulous as Rosina. Her rich and deep mezzo is surprisingly agile in the coloratura portions of her role, and her stage presence is a plus. Richard Croft's tenor is a little bigger than is heard in most performances, but that is another plus, because Count Almaviva shouldn't sound like a wimp. David Malis is a wonderful Figaro, mainly because he can act as well as sing. The rest of the cast perform well, and the pacing of the score under the baton of Albero Zedda is exactly what one would expect from a noted Rossini scholar. Which leaves the staging. Il Barbiere is a comic opera, and the libretto provides ample room for buffa action on stage by the cast. The delicacy and the comedic sense of this gem of an opera are simply overwhelmed by stage busyness,  like people running around with banners, ladders, furniture and all sorts of things that detract sharply from the plot, the real action and the singing. I am glad that I have this DVD, because I like Il Barbiere and this is the best performance currently available on DVD. I have reviewed a fair number of operas here, and maintain that the DVD medium is the next best thing to live performance. The video here is excellent, but why, oh why didn't the sound engineers produce this in Dolby 5.1 rather than in stereo? I recommend this performance to serious opera lovers, but I caution anyone who is ""testing the water"". There are other operas available on DVD that make better first ventures than this one.

The stupid never-ending antics on stage totally distract the watcher from the music and singing, which is for the most part so-so.  The only saving grace - and she is gorgeous - is the Rosina of Jennifer Larmore.  Her coloratura is fantastic, she is totally irresistible and is the (only) star of the piece.  Richard Croft is passable, Alaimo is not at his best, the Figaro is barely adequate and Dr Bartolo is painful to watch.  Oh, for a tenor like Raul Gimenez as Almaviva!

This production is far from the one I watched even if this one had the benefit of subtitles.
Too much movement onstage as one other reviewer put it. Very distracting, but I guess the director simply did not want to lose any of your attention. Talk about ""undivided""!

1245804,5,B00001O2G9,"Watching the performance in this video, it so justifies as  the masterpiece of Rossini. The bubling comedy is performed with such excellent singing and enlivened with background activty by a sort of circus group, which give the performance a more colorful and extra-ordinary nuance as a comedy. It is especially amusing to see David Mallis singing as the roguish Figaro in such a clear splendid  voice which enlivened the performance,as well as Richard Croft singing as the romantic prankish Almaviva in his sparkling tenor voice made this opera more enchanting, while Jennifer Croft singing in her rare half deep soprano voice made this masterpiece opera into perfection.  I have seen other performances of this opera but has never enjoy watching and listening over and over again to the performance and all the arias and singers. On top of that, the shooting of the video and recording is also so perfect that it seems like we were attending a live performance.

Lots of silly people doing nonsense (clown stuff) around the singers, distracting the audience from the performance. Loud footsteps disturbing the music. The singers seem they can not stay still for any second. The director added what he probably thought is humorous, and got as a result something worse than the Three Stooges at their worst. The only good thing to say about this version is that the singers are not bad (can not be blamed for the fiasco) and they do not sing out of tune.",994982400,5,561,4.73469387755102

I believe people were bothered by the sound of the footsteps. I too was bothered until I switched my surround sound from 'Hall' setting to 'Dolby' and further adjusted the sound to blend the soloists with the Orchestra. After a few minutes, I was satisfied that the sound quality was as close to being there as I had ever been in my life while in my living room. I called my kids and my wife and halfway thru the first act, I watched them applaud as if they had been there. And while none of them are pundits, the fact that they liked it as much as someone who has been going to the opera for over 30 years, speaks for itself.

1245808,5,B00001O2G9,"It saddens me to see that so many people have written negative reviews of  this performance, which I consider to be one of the best opera videos  currently available.  It's not a traditional production -- indeed, we're  probably never going to see anything like this again -- but isn't that the  whole point?  This production is unique, maybe even infuriating at times,  but it never stops being interesting.  I also happened to find it  incredibly entertaining.
It helps that there is some amazing singing by  Jennifer Larmore, who has a rich mezzo voice with ringing top notes, and  who handles the difficult vocal writing with ease.  She even looks like the  ideal Rosina -- youthful but alluring.  The rest of the singers are less  amazing, although Richard Croft does a good job with the part of Almaviva,  and the late, great Renato Capecchi (who in his prime sang Figaro, but  here, just a few years before he died, sings Bartolo) is very  characterful.
It also helps that this performance is conducted by Alberto  Zedda, THE living Rossini scholar, who coaxes the orchestra into providing  energetic playing that alternates easily between the vigorous and the  gentle, just as Rossini ordered.
The sound is actually quite fine,  notwithstanding some other reviewers' (inconsistent) complaints about  overmiking or undermiking.  Yes, it's true that you can often hear the  shuffling of feet on stage, but I've never been to a opera performance  where there isn't a noticeable amount of stage noise -- it's part of the  live opera experience!  Perhaps the ""Professor"" and others below  who found this stage noise problematic are used to hearing (or seeing) only  souped-up studio recordings of opera.  If so, then that is very  unfortunate.  In this case, the rhythmic footsteps of the dancers are  supposed to be a part of the performance, and they are far less intrusive  than the coughers and cellophane-candy-unwrappers that one would encounter  at any live opera performance.
The criticism that baffles me the most,  however, is the complaint that there is too much motion and action on the  stage in this performance.  As far as I can tell, the whole idea behind  this production is the key concept that rhythm and perpetual motion are at  the very heart of Rossini's music.  Incredibly, one negative reviewer below  even goes so far as to assert that ""all action needs to stop when a  singer launches an aria, or during an ensemble.""  This has got to be  one of the most crabbed and narrow-minded conceptions of opera that I have  ever read.  I, for one, am glad that the days of the old ""stand and  deliver""-style of opera performance have faded away, and that a  performance like this (the very opposite of ""stand and deliver"")  could have been made and preserved on DVD.",965692800,53,2786,4.871244635193133

It is a very imaginative presentation which I show to everyone that tells me  he (or she) does not like opera. I showed it even to my grandchildren (7  & 9) and they just loved it. This particular presentation merits a  chance by any non-opera fan. Althoough the sound is not the best (although  it is alright), the visuals area F A N T A S T I C!",965174400,6,417,4.175

This only done in the first scene (outside in the street). I've  seen Dario Fo's 'L'Italiani in Algeri' performed in the Amsterdam Music  Theatre by the Netherlands Opera, so I knew what to expect: a very  entertaining, artistic and beautiful performance.

1245812,1,B00001O2G9,"I totally agree with Glen Kelly and I only wish he published his review before I purchased this DVD. I found it so annoying that I couldn't bring myself to watch it to the end, despite sincere repeated efforts. It's not a  question of my preferences regarding traditional directing vs. ""Eurotrash""  - Dario Fo's pointing the origins of this comedy from the commedia  dell'arte is legitimate, but he goes about it in a very crude way that in  effect massacres the characters and the plot. This opera-buffa has a plot  and characters with feelings. All of this is completely flooded , rather  than highlighted by the purposeless commotion on stage. It seems he is  leery of exposing the audience to any aria devoid of dramatic interest, of  which there are several in any opera, lest the audience be  traumatized by  Rossini's real focus, which is the limits and possibilities of the human  voice. In order to appreciate that, all action needs to stop when a singer  launches an aria, or during an ensemble. During those moments the dramatic  tension or focus is transformed to a musical one. Opera, particularly with  recitatives, is based on moments of focused tension interspersed with more  relaxed moments that prepare for the next delight or climax. Fo displays a  complete lack of sensitivity to this opera's inner musical rhythm and  dramatic logic.
I was so upset by this production, that I had suspected  all the enthusiastic reviews were written by interested parties, until I  read the May 16 review from the British Columbia, Canada reviewer, that  seems genuine. I realize there are many people who can relish this set, the  question is who. I believe the clue to the answer is in the last reviewer's  report he enjoyed it with his 6&9 y/o kids. I doubt seasoned opera fans  will tolerate this production. It may belong in the legitimate realm of  ""light"" classical music made more accessible, e.g., what Waldos de los Rios  did in the 70's, or electronic Bach on a synthesizer from the same period.  A lot of people wouldn't have responded to Mozart without Waldos de los  Rios' adaptation of his 40's symphony, that became a hit in the 70's, and  this is not something to sneer at.",959385600,14,2195,4.76595744680851

Also, the singing is quite mediocre.  Soloists hammer out their lines with little sensitivity to the refinement of the Rossini score.  This is of course the fault of the conductor, but mostly of the lack of vocal control of the principals.",1391990400,,390,5.03125
