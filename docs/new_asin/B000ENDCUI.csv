2524173,5,B000ENDCUI,"Before Jackie Chan, before Bruce Lee, long before kung-fu action flicks left Hong Kong and went international, this movie paved the way and inspired hundreds of imitations. Hard to find, worth the search. Has almost zero ""special effects"" and offers great story, very tight cinematography, wonderful acting, accurate historical settings. If you need to catch flying arrows before they strike you in the head, study this movie carefully. Makes nice old-school companion to the modern masterpiece ""Kung Fu Hustle.""",1167782400,4,512,5.493670886075949

8111607,4,B000ENDCUI,"""Dragon Inn"" (1967) is an excellent Taiwanese Action/Adventure historical fantasy. Most of the action occurs within the closed or hemmed in confines of the inn, with brief but sensational confrontations in the Chinese desert.

If you like kung fu movies that have something more than just kung fu, you will like this one. Unlike the majority of kung fu movies widely released in Asia, this one actually has credibility among a Sino-Tibetan audience.

As far as the story, it's about a government official being executed by the order of a prestigious, corrupt eunuch. Eunuchs usurping power from a feeble emperor was a familiar sight in Chinese history. Overall, the story worked for me. This is among the best films of this kung fu Inn genre that I have seen.",1383177600,3,759,4.875968992248062
8111608,4,B000ENDCUI,"Like the title states, it is a classic. I really love these old kung fu movies. I actually bought this one without seeing it first based on how much I liked the remake or really the later version of this movie with jet li & I wanted to see how it all began. It's a good movie.",1361750400,4,276,3.8596491228070176
8111609,5,B000ENDCUI,"King Hu is a bit like Orson Welles in that a large part of his highest regarded work were never given proper release for the US home video/DVD market.  For Welles this includes ""Chimes at Midnight"", ""Othello"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"".  For Hu, ""Touch of Zen"" and ""Dragon Gate Inn"" are periodically available in the US but only in imported DVDs of inferior quality.

Dragon Gate Inn is one of the best kung fu movies ever produced, and ranks very well among Chinese/Hong Kong/Taiwanese films in general.  The plot concerns a semi legitimate eunuch--powerful enough to command a fearsome personal army--who kills a major rival and banishes his children.  Fearing revenge, the eunuch instructs his personal army to kill these children once they reach the desert outpost at Dragon Gate.  Discovering an inn in the wasteland,  the eunuch's men instead pose as government lawmen while preparing to ambush the children.  As fate would have it, various martial arts masters with murky motivations also show up at the inn.

The plot is a bit of a trifle, but it allows Hu to pile on balletic action sequences, loaded dialog, and most importantly a genuine atmosphere of suspense that would bring a smile to Hitchcock's face. Though Dragon Gate was a mid sixties movie and helped establish the rules of the genre the film feels very fresh relative to its progeny.  Though Hu's master swordsmen have superhuman skill, they are still vulnerable to the large army of regular soldiers, creating an interesting dynamic.  The cinematography is a sight to behold soaking up the character of the few settings for maximum effect.

The DVD video quality is mediocre at best the colors are pretty greyish though that may be what Hu intended, the audio a very weak mono mix but until Hu's films get a proper domestic release we should be thankful that the film is available at all.",1313884800,11,1866,4.870253164556962

8111611,3,B000ENDCUI,"While living in the Far East, I first saw this movie, Dragon Gate Inn, at a movie theatre in 1967.  When I found out that this DVD was available from Amazon, I bought it and enjoyed watching it again after more than 40 years, partly because of  my nostalgia for those days in the 1960s.  The storyline, taking place during the 15th century in the Ming Dynasty, is as follows.  In an attempt to gain control of the country, a power-hungry First Eunuch, Zhao Shao Qin, executes his political enemies, including his main political rival Yu Qian, the Defense Minister, and expels Yu's three children from the country.  Zhao plans to kill Yu's children at the Dragon Gate Inn, located near the border, by sending his team of assassins.  Zhao's plot fails when swordsmen Xiao Shao Zi (played by Shih Chun), Chu Huei (played by Shankuan Lingfeng) and her brother, and two defectors from Zhao's assassin team defeat the assassins under the direction of  the innkeeper Wu Ming, a former lieutenant of Yu's.  Eventually Zhao himself, a very high-level swordsman, battles the heroes (Xiao, Chu, etc.), and is killed.  The movie is filled with many beautifully-choreographed sword-fighting sequences.

Although not as well-made as King Hu's previous masterpiece, Come Drink with Me (Great Drunken Hero), this film is, in my opinion, perhaps one of the best wuxia films made in the 1960s.  The picture quality of this DVD, however, is rather poor: All the files (15 chapters) of this DVD are less than 4 GB.  A few minutes of the movie (in Chapter 12) are difficult to view because the DVD player (or computer) skips it.  It appears that a small company has produced this DVD based on a Japanese version (the menu is in Japanese), with the addition of English subtitles. However, I liked the subtitles, displayed below the movie screen, which are easy to see in clear and straightforward translations.  One interesting observation is that the title of this film in Chinese characters is written backwards on the side of the DVD case.  (The title is written correctly on the front cover of the case, reading right to left.)

I'll give 4.5 stars for the film and 1.5 stars for the quality of the DVD.  Therefore, I give this DVD a 3-star overall rating.",1224374400,4,2238,4.771428571428571
