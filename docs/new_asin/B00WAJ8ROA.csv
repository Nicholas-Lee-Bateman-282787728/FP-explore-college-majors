8712598,1,B00WAJ8ROA,"To say this DVD was disappointing is a massive understatement.
It is disgusting!
Lousy sound, terrible lighting -- totally amateur production.
There are far better clips on youtube.
Please, Amazon, show it to Emmylou and see what she thinks before you sell any more.",1449878400,4,266,5.068181818181818
8712599,1,B00WAJ8ROA,"I had to give this a one star to post my review; however, this DVD has to be the worst.  I believe it is ALL fan-filmed bootleg stuff.  Even some of the songs aren't synchronized!  I can only wonder what Emmylou would think of this?!  SO disappointing!  What a sham and what a shame!!!!!",1448841600,4,287,4.2407407407407405
8712600,1,B00WAJ8ROA,"This DVD is a total rip-off, it is a collection of recordings, some copied from the PBS Austin City Limits TV show, some recorded with hand-held VCRs at concerts, some done, without permission at SiriusXM shows and all of poor quality.  One song, recorded during Emmylou Harris's Spyboy tour in Europe is so bad the video and the audio are wildly out of synch.  Can you say ""Bootleg?""  The audio quality is poor and many of the videos are hand held.  The only songs worth watching are from Austin City Limits.  Emmylou Harris, who is known to be particular about her musical image, can't have had anything to do with this mess.  If you buy it, you will be rewarding rip-off artists, I can't believe that Emmylou Harris had anything to do with this crummy DVD, she isn't getting a cent from her efforts.  Likewise, PBS is also being cheated. Buy it if you have no ethics and no standards.",1448755200,5,887,4.50625
