1421488,4,B00005B6MV,"...and I choose this one.  I'm another ""Hamlet collector.""  When a friend brought this to me from a yard sale, I read the blurb & thought ""Well, have you ever seen a bad Hamlet?""  I sat down to watch, & was soon entranced by the production.  At three hours, it's a good length - not overly gutted like so many 2 hour productions, not rump-numbing like some ""eternity"" uncut versions.  The casting is imaginative and effective.  Finally - a Gertrude old enough to be Hamlet's mother, & an Ophelia old enough not to be jail bait!  The ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy is given a powerful set up - possibly the best I've ever seen. When I began to describe it to a friend, she stopped me because the intense emotion of the scene bothered her. Throughout there are wonderfully original (yet not disrupting) bits of stage action.  Most carry an element of surprise, so I won't mention those here, but a striking example comes soon after Polonius' death, when Hamlet is pursued, surrounded and captured by various guards.  One guard pulls out a long cord and lashes the Prince's hands together.
I do have one quibble, which is at odds with another review here.  I really dislike the musical score.  It reminded me of nothing so much as a saloon piano.",1063843200,9,1243,4.504464285714286
1421489,5,B00005B6MV,"You will NEVER find another Ophelia played like this!!!  SHE'S AMAZING!!!  This is the BEST Ophelia ever and Campbell Scott kick, too.

1421490,5,B00005B6MV,"I saw Campell Scott's ""Hamlet"" for the first (but certainly not the last!) time last week for my Renaissance Literature class. I instantly fell in love.
The setting (which is a beautiful house on Long Island, between 1880 and 1920, for those of you who were wondering) is lush, colorful, and exciting, which is a huge change from the typical drafty, cold, dark castle in which we see Hamlet sulking around.
The cast does amazing work with their interpretations -- Campell Scott and LisaGay Harding's being two of the most original I've seen yet -- and are all believable characters, not at all overacted. The cuts in the script are understandable (they had a three-hour limit), and work very well. Polonius works surprisingly well as a respectable elderly right-hand man to the king, rather than a bumbling idiot who likes to hear himself talk.
Also, the music in the film is gorgeous and engaging -- it is contemporary jazz, the main instruments being piano, drums, and trumpet, but it works beautifully with the film. It is rather unpredictable and subtle, in that it doesn't always tell you when you should pay attention to the action. Finally, a sountrack that plays to the intelligence of the audience, rather than pandering to it!
My class was fortunate enough to have Campbell Scott (who is an alumnus of my university) come in and talk with us about the interpretive choices they made while making the film, and after I heard what he had to say, I loved it even more. I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Shakespeare -- it is a fresh, original, believable take on an old classic, but it stays true to Shakespeare's intent with dignity and class. Five stars!",1020643200,26,1677,4.707482993197279
1421491,4,B00005B6MV,"I was moved and fascinated by Scott's performance and direction.  I ""collect"" Hamlets, and am very glad to have come across this one.  Scott's version isn't the full text, but the abridgements, to my mind, only highlight the dramatic pulses of this riveting play.  Scott brought the Prince to full, round life; I have only wept twice when Hamlet died, and this was the second time. The often-debated madness that overtakes both Hamlet and Ophelia were extremely well-founded and very well-acted here.  I cannot recommend this ""Hamlet"" too highly, especially to someone who is curious about what all the shouting is about but is afraid to run up against Shakespeare.  Scott's movie is accessible and eminently watchable.",1012694400,12,719,5.111111111111111
1421492,5,B00005B6MV,"I admit I hadn't heard of Campbell Scott, but felt I should watch a little bit of it on principle. But -- wow! -- it was so good, I watched it all and can't wait to get the video for myself and a copy for the public library in which I work. I thought it was a very fresh piece of acting by Scott and also the supporting cast. Can't wait to see what the teenagers think of it--it's not as stodgy as the older versions like Jacobi's and Oliver's, and not as long as Branagh's excellent version.",998092800,7,492,4.030612244897959
1421493,5,B00005B6MV,"No one is a bigger Kenneth Brangah fan than I am, but this version of Hamlet (which aired on the Odyssey channel a year ago) far surpasses his grandiose attempt, and is simply the best I have seen, better than Oliver and Gibson and all those others (but still watch 'Discovering Hamlet' if you have a chance...great behind the scenes of a young Kenneth's stage version).  But back to this film....it is a wonderful adaptation of the greatest play about modern man ever written, a good solid cutting which, unlike Kenneth's film version, keeps the story moving along and doesn't drag out every line which may have been necessary for the story to be told properly in Shakespeare's time, but isn't as neccessary for the film world of today.  But the cutting still keeps everything important and wonderful about the play.  Campbell Scott is PERFECT as Hamlet; the makers of this film did not try too hard to update it, but they certainly showed how even more relevant Hamlet is today as the complete and utter picture of modern man.  The other actors are great; the actress who played Ophelia (a black woman--another great twist and angle to Ophelia and Hamlet's complex relationship)is brilliant in the scenes when she goes crazy...with the lewd and disturbing songs Shakespeare wrote, she really takes things to another level.  The three most memorable scenes....the scene that Hamlet sees his father's ghost (the ghost comes out of the sand with some great special effects); a wonderful staging of the scene where Ophelia helps her father spy on Hamlet; and a stunning adaptation of Hamlet's famous monologue. Such a wonderful version.  So worth the extra money if you really want to own a fantastic version of Hamlet.  Especially great for teachers who want their English/drama classes how revolutionary Shakespeare really was. And hey! It was on the Odyssey channel so it's completely school appropriate...",997056000,33,1907,4.977987421383648
1421494,5,B00005B6MV,I think this is the best version of Hamlet I have ever seen!  It leaves Brannagh and Zeffirelli (no offense to the master) in the dust.  I have never cried for the Melancholy Dane before but Campbell Scott had me in tears.  It was a very creative time period and I thought that everyone did a fabulous job.  Well done Campbell!  Hope to see more of your work in the future.,993600000,9,373,4.197183098591549
1421495,4,B00005B6MV,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable Hamlet. I have viewed many (Oliver, Burton, Brannagh, Gibson etc.).  I found this one to be in the same class as the before mentioned.  In fact, I say that Campbell Scott's performance is better than Mel Gibson.  Nay, I say further that this whole production is better than most.  Example the Ghost scene, was actually frightening this time.  Very eerie.  Now I will watch the Christopher Plummer version to see how it compares.  In this film all of the performances were very good.  Great pacing, the dialogue flew without being mishmash like so many other of Shakespeares interpretations.",1320451200,,621,4.961165048543689
1421496,5,B00005B6MV,"Of the Hamlet DVDs I know well (Olivier, Branagh, Tennant, Scott), this may well be my favorite version, if only for Campbell Scott's brilliant performance as Hamlet. His interpretation is a far cry from Branagh's princeliness, wit, and complete sanity, or Tennant's sardonic craziness. Here, Hamlet is truly mad, and doesn't want to be. The look of terror and realization on his face at the line ""The time is out of joint. Oh, cursed spite / That ever I was born to set it right!"" is absolutely haunting. Later, he is possessed by echoes of his dead father's voice and an odd tinnitus-like ringing. ""To be or not to be"" is spoken after Hamlet has unsuccessfully attempted to cut his veins, facing the real possibility of his own death. In the final scene, then, his profession of madness to Laertes is much more than a convenient excuse for his actions.

The setting is unobtrusive and elegant, updated to some indefinite late 19th-century American mansion. Hamlet wears shirtsleeves and reading glasses, and goes barefoot.
The supporting cast ranges from outstanding (Lisa Gay Hamilton's Ophelia) to lackluster (Roger Guenveur Smith's Laertes).

Cons: Some of the abridgment choices are frustrating, most notably Gertrude's entire ""There is a willow"" speech and some of the dialogue between Hamlet and Horatio in the final scene (""Absent thee from felicity awhile"" etc.)--two of my personal favorite moments. The music for the film also leaves much to be desired, consisting almost entirely of minimalistic drums and piano.",1294444800,,1525,5.120481927710843
1421497,5,B00005B6MV,"This version of Hamlet does not seek to capture the soaring poetry of Shakespeare's language.  Delivery of lines is, instead, clear and thoughtful, so that the viewer is truly confronted with the struggle of the characters themselves.  One can almost forget that he is listening to Shakespeare at all.  The time period in which it is set works very well, and the sets and costumes are wonderfully effective, but nothing calls attention to itself.  What one encounters is simply  the compelling drama of Hamlet.  It does not take the place of every other Hamlet, but it certainly holds its own.",1252886400,,593,4.88
1421498,4,B00005B6MV,"The Hallmark Entertainment release ""Hamlet,"" adapted and directed by Campbell Scott and Eric Simonson, is a unique interpretation of the most celebrated drama in the English language. The crew does a great job of bringing the story into the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The film is beautifully shot, and the sets are breathtaking.
The cast overall does a fine job. Campbell Scott gives a fine performance as Hamlet, bringing a unique spin to the role. In this version, you get the sense that Hamlet is actually going mad, and Scott pulls it off very well. He's no Branagh, but he comes danged close. Roscoe Lee Browne is fantastic as Polonius, bringing a hint of tenderness to the role. My only complaints in terms of acting are two: Jamey Sheridan, who seems to do nothing but quote the lines without putting any real emotion into the role as Polonius; and Sam Robards, who is weak in the role of Fortinbras. The rest of the cast, including Lisa Gay Hamilton, Blair Brown and John Benjamin Hickey, give strong supporting performances.
Overall, this version of ""Hamlet"" is a fine representation of Shakespeare's masterpiece. It's not fantastic, but it is a good film that those who love Shakespeare will enjoy, and will make the play accessible to those who don't ordinarily read the Bard.
Grade: B+",1190592000,5,1314,4.870535714285714
1421499,2,B00005B6MV,"I apologize in advance to future customers who are looking for a version of Hamlet to purchase based upon the reviews left by us Shakespearean wags.  In the below reviews, near all praise Campbell Scott's enactment above that of Kenneth Branagh; I, however, couldn't disagree more.  I purchased Campbell Scott's version based upon the glowing reviews, but now after watching it I confess I am thoroughly disappointed for several reasons.  (I shall mention only five.)

First, as Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, writes, Hamlet is ""a meditation upon human fragility in confrontation with death."" Act V Scene i, where Hamlet returns to Denmark and is walking through the cemetery with Horatio, is horribly truncated.  Hamlet's soliloquy on his wonderment over the brevity of life is lost.  Moreover, Act V marks a ""conversion"" in Hamlet, or at least his transformation.  Scott presents Hamlet as a steady-lined character throughout the story.  The Hamlet of Act III is strangely the same as the Hamlet in Act V in Scott's version.  What I liked so much about Branagh's edition is that Act V showed a tempered Hamlet, one who is slowly checking his madness to the ruling of providence.  I was never convinced of Hamlet's genius in Scott's version; he did not stand out amongst the other characters.  In Branagh's version, there was no question who was guiding the play.  Branagh played the lunacy and brilliance of Hamlet well, climaxing in his rage against Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Act III Scene ii (""Will you play upon this pipe?"") and the death of Polonius, and then in taking up the part of death's scholar against the reality principle of mortality of the Gravedigger in Act V.

Second, Horatio, though splendidly performed by John Benjamin Hickey, was not the ""timeless"" observer that seems present in Shakespeare's play.  Horatio's suicidal temptation to follow his dear friend at the end of the play as well as Hamlet's charge for Horatio to abide to tell his story are cut out from Scott's edition.  ""Through Horatio we the audience contaminate the play"" (Bloom).  In Scott's edition, Horatio seemed reduced to a mere minor character.  Nicholas Farrell's portrayal in Branagh's edition is awesome--so passionate and loyal to his dear friend, Hamlet, and he is hauntingly present all throughout the play.

Third, Jamey Sheridan's portrayal of Claudius is not worth to be compared to that of Derek Jacobi in Branagh's version.

Fourth, the music in Scott's version is, for my taste, annoyingly minimalistic.  What was so satisfying about Branagh's version is that you ""felt"" that you were in the company of royalty all throughout the play.  The evening meal in Scott's edition pales in comparison to the wedding coronation in Branagh's.  The first introduction of the royal family feels nothing of royalty in Scott's edition.

Fifth, the costumes and sets were a bit daft in Scott's edition.  In Branagh's version, the costumes tell the story along with the script.  Hamlet, dressed in all black in Acts I-IV, wears white upon his return from England.  Claudius, dressed in white in Acts I-IV, wears black until the play's end.  Costumes followed conscience and vice-versa.  Everything in Scott's edition felt static and ""grey."" Moreover, how pathetic was Hamlet's funeral march in Scott's edition compared to the regal respect shown in Branagh's?

Based upon the glowing reviews for Scott's edition by the folk below, you would perhaps be foolish not to at least watch Campbell Scott's version of Hamlet--it has many laudable qualities (the Player King and Ophelia to name but two).  We all have our preferences in such matters do we not?  One person's masterpiece is another's flop.  In my gentle opinion, however, Hamlet, that great ""Poem Unlimited,"" feels rather ""limited"" in Scott's edition.",1176508800,10,3841,5.115569823434992
1421500,5,B00005B6MV,"As a student studying Shakespeare, I have to chosen to watch as many different versions of these films as I like. I watched the Hamlet film with Mel Gibson, and I did not like it at all. I think that it is way to dark, and to tell the truth, I do not think that Gibson did all that great of job with the role. This version of Hamlet though, I love. Campbell Scott did a wonderful job, I really enjoyed watching him play Hamlet. He delivers the lines beautifully, and does an amazing job making you believe that Hamlet was really Human. Gibson's Hamlet seemed to me like a dark haunted creature, but Scott's seemed like a real person.

While the file has it flaw's, like Ophelia, her charecter could have been stronger, and the music did need a little help. It was all in all the best Hamlet I have seen.

Now, I have NOT seen the Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, which many people say is the best, but I am going to see it as soon as I have the time. I do believe that is this my favorite version.",1133136000,3,990,4.151041666666667
1421501,5,B00005B6MV,"I teach Shakespeare classes to adults and have a personal collection of seven  VHS and DVD versions of Hamlet. Campbell Scott is by far the most believable, and my students have chosen it as their favorite version. Claudius is pefect--a smiling smiling villain absolutely capable of secucing his sister-in-law and murdering his brother. The casting of Polonius, Ophelia and Laertes worked well. The second choice of my students is the Mel Gibson, which had been number one until they saw Campbell Scott. The scene in the room where they have stored away all reminders of the old king is brilliant. Great film.",1112832000,17,609,4.970588235294118
1421502,5,B00005B6MV,This is by far the most amazing interpretation of Hamlet I've seen to date.  I would strongly recommend this version for anyone wanting to see/own a great performance of Hamlet.

1421503,4,B00005B6MV,"Updated to a late 19th century era, this Hallmark Hall of Fame TV production often succeeds where others have failed. It keeps the language of old, although it is spoken unpretentiously with American accents, and the cadence has a flatness to it that takes getting used to. The racially mixed all-American cast in on the whole good, with only a few weak links.
It's filmed in and around an elegant Long Island, N.Y. manor house, and the soundtrack by Gary DeMichele is effective, using mostly solo piano, and occasionally some  percussion instruments and horn, and manages to sound medieval and modern almost simultaneously. The piercing sound that accompanies the ghostly image of Hamlet's father is a little loud for my liking and sensitive ears, but a similar sound is often heard by people who are about to faint, so perhaps it is appropriate.
Campbell Scott, who also co-directed with Eric Simonson, gives a bravura, fascinating performance as Hamlet, and it has subtleties that make his Dane interesting for several viewings. John Benjamin Hickey as Horatio is also impressive, Jamey Sheridan makes an excellent calculating, smooth Claudius, Blair Brown a believable Gertrude, and Lisa Gay Hamilton is a lovely Ophelia.
Though my first choice for Hamlet on film is the Gibson/Zeffirelli version, followed closely by the beautiful Olivier one, this is surprising and innovative without leaving the spirit of the play behind, and definitely worth watching for anyone who appreciates this glorious work, and my favorite of all of Shakespeare's plays.

I have seen every commonly available filmed Hamlet (over 20 films, if you look for them) and this Hamlet is one of the few I believed. His line delivery is a very effective and sometimes astoundingly trenchant in an American ""natural"" diction. Nice too is a serious, credible Polonius rather than the usual old clown. I'd say Claudius and Gertrude aren't so strong; there are a few odd textual lacks (and also some good inclusions you don't often hear) but this is standout version for both casual viewers and Shakespeare semi-experts.",1464652800,,672,4.752136752136752
