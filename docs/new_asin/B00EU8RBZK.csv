8609388,5,B00EU8RBZK,"Great trio of absolutely gosh-awful grade-Z low budget stinkers.
The Wild World of Bat-Woman is about a crime-fighting femme who has a posse of bikini or tight capri clad beauties who fight evil WITH ALL SINCERITY.  Watch the film to know where that comes from.  Bat-Woman herself sports a tight outfit with feathers, a mask, and a bat tattoo on her bosom.  She fights crime and evil sincerely from her head-quarters in suburbia, a nice house with a pool where her posse watusi their hearts out with all sincerity.  The MST3K group riffed this film very entertainingly on another DVD.  Catch that if you can.
Curse of the Stone Hand is an incomprehensible film cobbled together from a Mexican-Chilean movie (dubbed into English) and scenes with American actors such as John Carradine.  To this day I still can't make sense of it.
Man Beast
An expedition schleps up the largely un-snowy Himalayas to search for a previous climbing party.  They find seven-foot tall Yetis in ratty fur (or hair) and a treacherous hybrid who wants to mate with the lone female in the search party.
The quality of the DVD is excellent.  Highly recommended for bad movie fans.",1463184000,2,1154,4.792929292929293

8609391,4,B00EU8RBZK,"Aficionados of 1960s garbage cinema are well acquainted with the work of Jerry Warren. This disc showcases three of his films, and each is illustrious for different reasons. The four star rating is due to the relative rarity of these films and the degree of quality taken in their packaging. I would not call the DVD lavish, but is way better than most multi-film DVDs and actually features a few decent extras including Batwoman trivia, a reenactment of an interview with Katherine Victor (""'The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman' has always been the skeleton in my closet!""),  and even selectable English subtitles. I was especially interested in the revelation that Warren was offered $330,000 not to run ""Batwoman"" but didn't take the offer; I was less amused to hear how he berated his actors and frequently belittled and yelled at them.

First up is ""Man Beast"" which sports slightly higher production values than the other two, though typically abysmal acting, direction, and editing. Essentially, the protagonists undertake a hazardous anthropological study in the Himalayas in search of Yeti. Not all is as it seems and a bout of intrigue and murder relating to a half human-half yeti hybrid with ulterior motives provides the film with its requisite tedium. Oh, did I say tedium? I meant to say excitement of course. It is a very, very exciting movie that's only 62 minutes long but somehow feels much longer. Please particularly note the extreme padding of the film with endless mountaineering footage. Speaking of padding, check out the extremely padded yeti suit, which makes the film worthwhile by itself. You'll be on the edge of your seat for sure!

Up next is my favorite Warren film ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman."" I have seen this film many times both in the original uncut version and as an excellent MST3K episode. The concept of cashing in on the Batman craze with Katherine Victor in an otherworldly costume of her own design defeating Rat Fink and G. Octavius Neon in a plot involving an atomic powered hearing aid is nothing but perfect B-movie genius. It's completely embarrassing, utterly ridiculous, and absolutely irresistible for genuine lovers of camp cinema.

Finally there's ""Curse of the Stone Hand"" which features John Carradine and Katherine Victor in a crazy quilt of a movie stitched together from two movies, one Chilean, one Mexican, and neither good. Add to this mess a framing device about a house that is filled with and surrounded by stone hands and new footage with Carradine and Victor designed to make sense of it all (Not!) and you have all the makings of a disaster. The house brings a curse to all of its owners: one gets involved in a gambling and suicide club (Don't draw the queen of hearts!), while the other plot deals with abusive sibling rivalry and a literal skeleton in the closet. Watch for the worst horse cart-related dramatic scene in movie history and some of the clunkiest narration in memory. This is a confusing, disjointed film that isn't even up to the normal standards of Jerry Warren.

Volume one of ""The Jerry Warren Collection"" is a prize for lovers of genuinely bad films: these movies are all awful, but all have different nuances making them uniquely bad. I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in bottom of the barrel filmmaking.",1435795200,6,3313,4.898395721925134
8609392,4,B00EU8RBZK,"... each masterwork tells it's own amazing story, too intricate to be gone into here.  i diligently wait for Vol. 3-20 of other jerry warren epics.",1425600000,,147,4.653846153846154
8609393,4,B00EU8RBZK,"Odds are that if you are even on this page, you know the type of films Jerry Warren is known for. The 4 stars doesn't imply these movies are on par with anything by Michael Powell, George Kukor, or Carol Reed. These are what they are Drive-In B movie and dreadfully low budget (there is good low budget, see Detour).

The DVD by Kit Parker Films/VCI Entertainment is extremely well made. The movies are well represented with high quality prints of each. These movies couldn't look or sound better than what you have here and given the nature of these movies, you'd almost never expect this much care to be taken to release these movies on DVD in any form, much less a good form. You can contrast these with the public domain prints of other Jerry Warren movies (Incredible Petrified World, Terror of the Bloodhunters, Teenage Zombies) and you do get something worth your money here (IF you are looking for low budget horror/sci fi from the 50s and 60s).

There isn't much in the way of extras here but what is here is enjoyable. It is an audio reenactment of a portion of an interview with Kathrin Victor conducted in the early 90's for a horror mag. You get some information about the actress, Warren and the interesting backstory of Bat Woman and its attempted release.

As for the movies, Man Beast is Warren's first film (and maybe his best) and its about exhibitions in search of the Yeti. The Curse of the Stone Hand is parts of a couple of movies from South America with new scenes filmed to try and tie all the footage together with this stone hand and The Wild World of Bat Woman is 100% pure Jerry Warren. The story is about an atomic hearing aide and the mad dash to obtain it before Rat Fink gets his hands on it.

Recommended DVD if you are interested in these types of movies because you will get your money's worth.",1397692800,16,1830,4.4375
8609394,2,B00EU8RBZK,"I got this primarily for Man Beast, but couldn't get rid of annoying sub-titles. I tried, but could not defeat the sub-titles throughout the movie. Don't know if this is a common problem with this disc or not.",1395619200,,209,4.526315789473684
8609395,4,B00EU8RBZK,"As I said with Vol. 2, these will never be good movies but are cheesy fun if you like 50s - 60s schlock films.  Warren was one of the best at making junk movies.  He may have made a good one along the way but if he did, I've never encountered it.  These are what they are and are fun in that context.",1393804800,9,300,3.7301587301587302
8609396,2,B00EU8RBZK,"I will admit I haven't watch the entire disc,but the reason I haven't because the movie I watched was terrible. The Bat Woman was the  one I watched and it was really really bad. Just some overweight middle age woman with a Mardi Gras type of mask on with a bat painted on her chest. When I bought this I thought it would be interesting,but it's not. I did watch part of another movie on this disc but it was pretty bad. Sometimes these types of movies can be fun, but this is just bad. I would recommend to stay away from this one. If you have to get it don't pay too much for it because it isn't worth it.",1392508800,8,607,4.016528925619835
