8532932,4,B008Z1SIFA,"Very interesting documentary of a convicted Ponzi schemer, who is under house arrest, while awaiting his jail sentence of an expected 120 years for stealing and misappropriating millions of dollars of other people's money. I do not think he is made to be a sympathetic person here, in fact, he mostly appears as a major a hole who ruined many people lives, including his own family.

A lot of this is him trying to tell his lawyers how to approach the judge in influencing his final sentence. The guy just happens to also be a lawyer. This video is definitely not an endorsement on becoming a Ponzi schemer or a stealer of millions through theft and deception.

You as schemer, will be become overwhelmed and you will lose control, and you will be discovered and caught, arrested, tried and convicted and you will go to jail for a very long time.

The kicker here and its a huge one, is that, just prior to his trial, he found himself in a foreign country, with $100 million dollars in the bank, and he was faced with the consummate question of his life, do I stay here with a $100 million dollars and not go back to the US to face justice or do I go back to my son and family and face the music.

Stay free, with $100 million, in this foreign country, or go back home to the US and face a very, very long jail sentence. He choose to go home.",1478908800,,1342,4.292490118577075
