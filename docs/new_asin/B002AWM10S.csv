8360497,5,B002AWM10S,Great video. Many good tips for beginners and the good golfer. Some of the tips I have used. I'm new at golf and can use all of the tips I can get. This video is helpful.,1333756800,,170,3.75
8360498,5,B002AWM10S,"I took a gamble and got this DVD, mostly because for the price.  I was tiered of reading the same old, and watching the same old, so I said what the hay let me get it.  Very informative, found out 3 things that I did not know about the golf swing.  Mike and Brian really break things down on the DVD that made me watch it a few more times since getting it.  I liked it so much that I am going to take lessons from Mike or Brian in the spring. Its not the same old trash that is recycled by other PGA pros or teachers.
the only CON: I have that I wish it was longer, and there was a sequel to it.",1264896000,2,595,3.736
8360499,5,B002AWM10S,"This video has 2 of the next great teachers you will hear about. Michael Jacobs and Brian Manzella have a really big following on the internet and in younger golfing circles. They incorporate the principles of ""The Golfing Machine"" without the technical jargin and confusion. if you don't walk away from this video with a better understanding of the golf swing you should be playing tennis!",1250899200,3,390,4.924242424242424
