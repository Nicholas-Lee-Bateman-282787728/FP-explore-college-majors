8324009,1,B000A2HA7Y,"I thought that this would be an interesting DVD, how wrong I was...

The description doesn't tell you that it is unauthorised... I think that says it all, and it's 28 minutes long!!

I've been a huge U2 fan for years, and was so dissapointed with this. The main man that was apparently a biographer, was abysmal, he commented that the Joshua Tree was released in the early 1990's, and said that Bono's name came from the Latin word for Good, which is what his intentions were. That's partly true, Bono Vox is his full name, taken from a Hearing Aid shop in Dublin. The guy really had no idea what he was talking about. It was a huge dissapointment.

The sound quality was terrible, the whole 28 minutes of the DVD was a waste of time.

I paid over $8 for this, and expected something better for my money...",1164931200,9,806,4.3533333333333335
