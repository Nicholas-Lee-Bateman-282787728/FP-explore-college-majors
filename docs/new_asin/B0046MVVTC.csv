8458918,3,B0046MVVTC,This is not bad but it lacks the white hot fire and conviction of the original series. The main characters were not as well scripted or acted in my view and several scenes looked too slick and therefore improbable. It is still ahead of most similar American crime dramas but with a little more care it could have been a lot better.,1349913600,,331,4.354838709677419
