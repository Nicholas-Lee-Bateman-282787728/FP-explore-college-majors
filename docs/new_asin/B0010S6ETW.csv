If Elvis would have lived,he would have had one heck of a Palace in Branson!!Anyway,it's sad of his untimely death. Many of Pat's movies have never been released on DVD from the 50's and 60's which is sad because he was also a talented actor as well as a singer. So distributors take note,you won't be displeased!!",1201219200,18,397,4.685714285714286
