Seasons 1 and 2 were wonderful ...the characters were strong and wrapped up into their world and then... season three ..new people with no warmth or answers to why .... Obviously season three has new writers and producers because the language is full of cursing and the interaction between the characters is dull and wooden.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ...NOT WORTH A DIME!!!",1518912000,,404,4.785714285714286
8737111,1,B016QEZRHE,"Loved season 1 and 2 and then... where did everyone go?  No respect for the viewer who watched previous seasons.  Not even much of a lame excuse as to what happened to the characters of the previous seasons.  I suppose they think get over it, it's just a show, but this hardly makes for loyal viewing.",1499212800,2,301,4.339285714285714

8737114,2,B016QEZRHE,"After reading the reviews of the 3rd series, I'm not sure I want to purchase it. Big mistake
of replacing some of the main characters and not keeping up with the dynamic writing for
this series. They really shouldn't have gotten rid of Moon Dailly's character in the first
season! This ensemble of a cast was great as it was. I'm glad one of my favorites, Donald
Sutherland, stayed with the show. If the writing and acting is as flat as the other reviewers
say it is, I don't think I want to waste the money on the 3rd installment of this series. No Thanks!",1467417600,3,557,4.314285714285714
8737115,1,B016QEZRHE,"Season 1 and 2 were great. We loved everything about them.
Season 3 destroyed everything great about. The great team is gone. We have no finish to that story. The way they worked together to solve cases,GONE. The colored girl who I thought was both beautiful and interesting is just there with nothing interesting to do and they have dulled down her looks. They brought back Sebastian down the road but left him in a room with a computer....and so now he too has become a bore like the rest.  It is like watching a completely different, only this time, very dull show with dull people solving cases in a very dull way. They must have gotten new writers. I have no idea how in the world they thought people were gone to like the big mess they created. Kinda sad.",1465776000,6,761,4.397163120567376
8737116,1,B016QEZRHE,"I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Crossing Lines. The settings were different and exotic, the actors were new and fresh - not the standard Hollywood see-them-in-everything actors...and then.  The show had a history of killing off lead actors in shocking ways (were they unhappy on the show? Fired? Did they have a problem keeping them?) BUT, at the end of season 2 you lose everybody whose interesting and they don't really explain anything! Then they replace these interesting people with the same 'ol Hollywood stand ins! I don't think I can bear to watch Elizabeth Mitchell in another thing.",1464912000,5,600,4.9405940594059405
8737117,2,B016QEZRHE,"I loved the first two seasons of Crossing Lines. Then two or three of the main actors disappeared and their replacements are boring. The blond woman who replaced the head of the 'CCI' team just has no pizazz. The 'black' woman, who seemed so beautifil and intriguing in season 2, has become flat. Her lines don't help her. (Her wigs stood out when she first came on by being exactly the same, large bunchy, nappy hair in two poofs which are Exactly the Same in each episode -- unlikely, and, because repetitive, distracting. She has better, more interesting hair in 3 but still no better lines. Neither does anybody else.

The director hasn't the imagination apparently to goose up any of the former or new characters so I had to stop in the middle of 3 as I was falling asleep.

The writing becomes repetitively shtick -- he/she uses the old-style format of familiar characters in new whodunnits, which don't on the whole interweave and hold water as the long-term story did in the first two.",1458518400,5,993,4.636363636363637
