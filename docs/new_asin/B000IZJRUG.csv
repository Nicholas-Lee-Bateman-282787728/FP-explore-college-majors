8148012,5,B000IZJRUG,"Touching, real yet romantic - this is a beautiful film that explores the complicated relationship between mother and daughter. In the end one realizes life is too short to hold grudges and that people should be appreciated while they're still alive to know that they are. Sad yet lovely. Highly recommended film!",1335830400,,312,5.019230769230769
8148013,3,B000IZJRUG,"Complicated mother-daughter relationships always have the makings of a good story, but especially so when the mother is a famous singer who neglected her children for the sake of her career and the daughter witnessed her beloved father's death but hid the weapon so her mom wouldn't go to jail. Actress Shabana Azmi is brilliant as the selfish, driven Rukhsana. Her adult daughter Tehzeeb (played by Urmila Matondkar) is a content, middle-class housewife, happily married to Salim (Arjun Rampal) and the caretaker of her mentally challenged sister, Nazneen (Diya Mirza). Rukhsana and Tehzeeb struggle to reconcile--and both want to, no matter how much they lash out at each other--and in the process, glimmers of insight make the reasons for their discord less black and white. When the gun that killed Tehzeeb's father resurfaces and a tragedy occurs, the truth of what happened the night he died comes to light, leading to a somewhat unexpected, bittersweet end. The only things marring this film are the rather bizarre and off-putting dance numbers. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1287,5.924731182795699
