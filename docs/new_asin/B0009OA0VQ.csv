8064024,1,B0009OA0VQ,"I bought these videos for my daughter. She thought they were ok, but for me, they were a total disappointment. The video is the same, but the audio is all different and more politically correct. The theme song that I loved is gone and replaced with a really lame song. Definitely pass on these videos--the misleading title makes you think they're the classic versions, and then they're this updated crap.",1211068800,2,404,4.785714285714286
8064025,5,B0009OA0VQ,"A throwback DVD to a time when our culture was satisfied with less technical wizardry but happier with more substance, both in morals and originality. The Kimba cartoons capture some of the decency our society once took for granted.",1147219200,6,232,4.9743589743589745
8064026,5,B0009OA0VQ,"The cartoon may be lame to you but I wonder how old you are.  I watched this as a little girl, it was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young and something that we used to ""play"" all the time along with Speedracer and the original Batman.  If anything, I enjoy it for the memories.",1136505600,8,286,4.0
8064027,1,B0009OA0VQ,"What a lame DVD, The white lions from father of the pride are 100% above this drivel,  why use up shelf space for trash like this?  But do check out Father of the Pride or Lion king if you would like to see a better white lion, or any lion show on DVD.  Could not give this one to Goodwill fast enough!!!",1119744000,4,304,3.870967741935484
8064028,3,B0009OA0VQ,"Kimba the White Lion is such a great show, it's a real shame it has not been treated well on DVD. There are several things that need to be explained about these ""Cartoon Classics"" DVDs.

First, longtime fans of Kimba will be surprised that these episodes sound totally different than what they remember. These episodes do NOT have the original English soundtrack, made in 1966 with Billie Lou Watt as Kimba. These episodes have an English soundtrack made in 1993 with Yvonne Murray as Kimba. To be fair, though, it is this newer version that has been on TV worldwide over the last decade, and is on TV here in the US right now. Newer Kimba fans will likely want this version. (This is the same version of Kimba that was released on VHS some years back as ""Kimba The Lion Prince"". The full set of 4 DVDs has four episodes that were not on VHS, however.)

Are these episodes uncut? Well, yes and no. Each episode was shortened by at least 3 minutes by the producers of this 1993 version. These DVDs contain as much as is available for each episode, but if you have the feeling that something was cut out, you're right, and the missing material simply does not exist in this version of Kimba.

Now, the reason for the low star rating: These episodes have been transferred to DVD very poorly. There is no reason for this, since the 1993 masters were made on videotape from very beautiful Japanese originals. The picture on these DVDs is often ""blown out"", meaning that light-colored areas are too bright, and all detail is lost in them. Considering the coloration of the title character, this is a major problem.

Something not mentioned on Amazon's page is that all episodes can be played in either English or Spanish.

Kimba The White Lion is one of the greatest animated shows of all time. If you want the current version that's on TV, this is the only way to get it right now. Just be warned that the picture isn't going to be very good.",1119398400,48,1937,4.4914772727272725
