8734289,5,B015Q5Y4D2,"""ITV 60"" is entertainment, a trip down Memory Lane for lovers of classic British ""telly"", and a fine historical document all rolled into one collection.  Many fine shows that a) I remember fondly from my childhood and teen years and b) were totally unknown to me are to be found here.  Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's output is represented by ""Thunderbirds"", ""Space: 1999"", and ""The Protectors"" can be found here.  You can take a laugh-filled ride ""On The Buses.""  ""Doctor In The House"" is a hilarious cure for a case of the blues.  Patrick McGoohan shows up both as ""Danger Man"" and ""The Prisoner.""  There is a plethora of other material, including a groundbreaking documentary on Cambodia telecast in the late 1970s.  NOTE TO NON-UK BUYERS:  This is a Region 2 DVD collection, and to play these discs, you must have either a Region 2 DVD player or a Region-free DVD/Blu-Ray player, which you can purchase on Amazon in their Electronics section.  Buy it and see what British Private TV had wrought for decades.  Cheers!",1468627200,2,1016,4.787356321839081
