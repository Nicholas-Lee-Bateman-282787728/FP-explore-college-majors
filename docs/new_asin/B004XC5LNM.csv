8446694,2,B004XC5LNM,"Quality is okay.  Too many Chevrolet commercials.  There were none for Imperial, Continental, Ambassador, Packard, Hudson, Willys or Henry J.  There are several more for Chrysler, Dodge, Desoto, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Matador, Rambler, AMC, Buick, Pontiac and Lincoln which should have been included in this video.  Studebaker and Mercury had several good commercials.  Also, what about the films of the GM Motoramas, auto shows and sales/training films the car companies prepared or the concept cars?",1402617600,,500,5.702702702702703
8446695,2,B004XC5LNM,"What a disapointment.  If you own other vintage commercial DVDs you will have seen most of these.  Half the DVD is about the 1954 Chevy.  Only one muscle car ad, about 30 seconds long for the Camaro. Don't waste your money.  Unless you own a '54 Chevy!",1328832000,10,252,4.297872340425532
