8192262,5,B000PKUU3W,It's very hard to understand relativity. But this film got across the basic principles of the subject in a very enjoyable and thought-provoking way. I recommend the film not only for serious education but as the best kind of science documentary for the general pubic. Ustinov was brilliant.,1490400000,,290,5.0625
8192263,5,B000PKUU3W,I have been looking for this documentary for over 30 years. I first viewed it on PBS in Chicago so long ago. It is a great video to help anyone understand a few of Albert Einstein's theories.,1487203200,,191,4.1891891891891895
8192264,5,B000PKUU3W,"Phenomenal movie I watched it many years ago, I just had to get a DVD. Packaging was great no complaints.",1481846400,,105,4.3
8192265,5,B000PKUU3W,"while interesting, will not be viewed again...the science is okay, but there were no subtitles and British accents are sometimes difficult to understand",1480982400,,152,5.6521739130434785
8192266,1,B000PKUU3W,Contrived and amateurish,1478131200,,24,7.333333333333333
8192267,1,B000PKUU3W,There are no redeeming qualities of this very dated and poorly edited movie. Not only are the production values for Einstein's Universe extremely poor but more importantly much of the scientific data discussed throughout the film is no longer accurate. There are more contemporary DVDs discussing these same topics in a manner that is both more compelling and accurate. Save your money (and time) and avoid this horrid film.,1476921600,,424,5.159420289855072
8192268,5,B000PKUU3W,An oldie but a goodie.  It brings me back to my childhood watching it on Channel 13.,1474156800,3,84,3.9411764705882355
8192269,5,B000PKUU3W,"This is a wonderful 1979 Documentary, originally broadcast on Public Television, and in part based on a book by Nigel Calder.  Reasonably simple and for the layman, young sirs interested in physics, but also simply superb [!] as Peter Ustinov leads a discussion of the Theory of Relativity with past luminaries such as John Archibald Wheeler, Irwin Shapiro, and a young, very intelligent, Roger Penrose.  In it Peter visits an Observatory in West Texas, and performs numerous thought experiments of the type Einstein thought up.  This is fun, highly recommended, and a delight to see the charming Mr. Ustinov discuss theoretical physics.  The documentary also exists as a memorial to Albert Einstein himself.",1382745600,4,708,5.238938053097345
8192270,5,B000PKUU3W,A classic science show that needs to be seen more often because it correctly shows what you see around you traveling nearly at the speed of light. They used a computer back in about 1988 with ray tracing to show how you can see the front side of buildings seemingly before you pass them (you did pass them). It just seems that way. Rulers are not shortened they are rotated. Motorcycles used are rotated. Changes what is taught in most books.,1294185600,7,442,4.469135802469136
8192271,5,B000PKUU3W,"If you ever struggled with the concepts of Albert Einstein, this is the DVD to watch.  With clarity, simplicity, and many visuals, Peter Ustinov, the great actor, brilliantly explains the theories with many world renowned scientist.  What Peter lacks in scientific intelligence make this video a classic winner.  Even the non-technical but scientifically interested individual will smile as they understand the basic concepts of Einstein's thinking and his scientific model.  Truly one of the best science videos ever.",1250726400,11,518,5.602564102564102
