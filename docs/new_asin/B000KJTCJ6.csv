8157198,1,B000KJTCJ6,"Well, I give props to anyone making a bigfoot movie for release. This video is probably a bunch of friends (non-actors) that pooled their money together and made it on the weekends. To be brief, the video is so not worth the price tag and I'm sure your time is more valuable. In a nutshell: bad acting, bad effects and poor storyline.",1272153600,,334,4.403225806451613

8157200,5,B000KJTCJ6,"There will be two types of people for 'Scream of the Sasquatch': those who hate it for bad acting and those who love it for exactly what it is. This is NOT a documentary on bigfoot hunting, it is a parody of documentaries on bigfoot hunting. We have two characters, Frank VanderSchmidt and Ron Warren. Ron is the photo-proof kind of guy; Frank is his cousin (Larry)'s wife's brother and is of the kill-em-for-proof kind of guy. There are no opening credits and it's shot in such a way that makes you sort of think it is a viable documantary but there's never any mention of 'the big names' in the field of bigfoot research so you're not sure. What we get is a small cast that represents an amalgamation of those Dahinden, Krantz, Green, Byrne, Bindernagel, Fish, and the such. There's even the ""Robby Peterson"" film of 1972 parodying the famed Roger Patterson film.

This is an independent film in which, presumedly, the director used his friends to fill out the cast. The acting seems bad because you have real people portraying ""real people."" This is along the lines of _The Blair Witch Project_ for bigfoot people. I was sitting there watching it, disbelieving there are people like this in the bigfoot field but truth be told, that's what some of them actually are like. The character of Ron is very Paul Freeman-like while Frank is more of the obsessive Rene Dahinden type. The college professor/author is even a knock on the late Grover Krantz. I agonized over how bad the beginning of this was (thinking it was some guy's personal documentary) but when I just sat back and watched it, my view turned and the ending was so great that I ended up loving this film.

Overall, it's a fantastic Blair Witch-esque parody on sasquatch research and the 'investigators'. The best part is when you totally realize that it isn't really a documentary (took me about 15-20 minutes cuz I ordered it thinking it was one). I'm so glad I watched the whole thing because the acting is so bad that it helps the cohesion of the film and makes it work. Scream of the Sasquatch is perfect for ""believers"" and ""skeptics"" because it is so funny in that way. Believers will laugh at the parody, skeptics will say that's exactly how believers are. Certainly worth the money I paid for it and I'll watch it many times. Great job Guy Gilray",1179705600,7,2318,4.596618357487923
8157201,2,B000KJTCJ6,"Wasn't quite what I was expecting, I mean it was written well, I like that they had the guys out there in the the woods, but they never found any actual real evidence, they were mostly just trying to outdo each other for the noteriety, and one ended up getting himself killed for it. I figure of your are serious about trying to hunt this creature then you should know all safety measures available.",1173312000,,399,4.405405405405405
8157202,1,B000KJTCJ6,Poor acting and unbelievable scenarios riddle this lame excuse for a bigfoot documentary.  Save your money!!!,1172188800,3,109,5.8125
8157203,5,B000KJTCJ6,"We have all seen movies and documentaries about Bigfoot, from a blood thirsty monster to a human-like creature. However, this movie does not focus so much on Bigfoot himself, but on the people who sacrifice their lives in pursuit of this mysterious being. I enjoyed the movie because it is humorous, well-written, and unpretentious. To me, the movie is a story of a man's quest to prove Bigfoot's existence, how it isolated him from his family and friends, and eventually destroyed everything he had. You will be talking about this movie long after you have seen it.",1164412800,4,566,4.845360824742268
