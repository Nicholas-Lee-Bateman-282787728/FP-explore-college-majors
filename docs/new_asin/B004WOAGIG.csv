4488413,4,B004WOAGIG,"Much more in keeping with the videogame upon which this franchise is based, this third adventure takes the action to Nazi Europe of World War Two, and for fans of these films, of which apparently there aren't too many, this is indeed a good one.  Uwe Boll's BLOODRAYNE movies are very much like modern-day HAMMER horror films, some better than others, and this latest R-rated, bloody spectacle offers all thrills possible.

  As far as the videogame origins, this movie excels at recreating the look and style of the game itself, and although the story has been altered once again, the spirit of the videogame (finally!) is alive and well.  Michael Pare (remember THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT?) returns from the last BloodRayne, this time playing a completely different character, and the sexy Natassia Malthe is quite good as Rayne herself, no longer the ""new girl"" in the role.  Unfortunately, if you are not a fan or player of the BLOODRAYNE videogame, chances are this thing will not appeal to you.  Those interested, however, can delight in seeing the sexiest, best BLOODRAYNE yet, blending Nazis and vampires into a thrilling mix.  Keeps it short, too, with a running time under 90 minutes.",1311120000,8,1195,4.969849246231155
4488414,4,B004WOAGIG,"The title for this review was spoken by the eeeeeevil Nazi doctor, the expert on Vampires, and it sums the movie up -- quiche, silly, and fun that does not take itself too seriously, and neither should you!

I read the existing reviews, and none gave this film above three stars.  The other reviewers looked at this movie from their perspectives, and I respect that, but I had a different take.

If you're seriously considering either renting or buying this DVD then you are **NOT** buying it for its unique, great insight into the inner turmoil of man's soul.

(If you **ARE** then STOP reading NOW!  Move along.  Move along, there is nothing to see here!)

Instead, you, the most discerning of B-grade fans, you want to see some awesome over-the-top fight scenes.  You are looking for some improbable lusty scenes.  You want to see vampire Nazis -- Boo! Hiss!  (If you cannot hate Vampire Nazis then you are not human!)

If you are still reading at this point then you will likely enjoy this film.

Like Corman, Uwe Boll is the master of his craft.  He understands his fans, and Uwe Boll delivers.

Yes, the acting is over-the-top, chewing-on-the-scenery schlock -- intentionally!  That is the key.  Uwe Boll and his acting ensemble know that this is a B-movie for B-movie fans.

There is no complicated plot.

Vampires are bad.  Nazis are bad.  Combine the two, and they are super bad (er, ..., but not Super Bad(tm) the Movie).

Super bad things must be destroyed.  Enter ... dum, dum, dum ... Rayne, the Damphyr.

She cuts.  She stabs.  She loves like a Houri.

Like most of Uwe Boll's movies, the DVD extras are just as much fun as the movie.  The interviews and looks behind the camera are pure fun.

Clearly the production and acting crews understood the movie and its intended audience.  While there were no doubt long hours for some of the takes, and the weather was probably unpleasant at times, you could tell from the interviews that the crew genuinely enjoyed making the movie.

I genuinely enjoyed watching it.

One caveat, make sure you understand why the film is rated ""R.""  There are some relatively graphic love making scenes in addition to the over-the-top, red gushing violence.  While you would be likely to guess the latter, the former came as a bit of a surprise to me -- I expected some flashes of skin, but Uwe Boll went the extra mile (inches?) in the lust scenes this time.

Overall, a fun romp for the B-movie fan!

In service,

Rich

4488415,1,B004WOAGIG,"Wow, this was 1 hour, 12 minutes I'll never get back. The only good part was the short lesbian sex scene. This movie is so bad they needed to stoop to that. Even the music wasn't played by a real orchestra. It was all synthesized. It's basically a freshman A/V student's wet dream. I hope he got a good grade.",1310342400,9,309,4.166666666666667

4488417,2,B004WOAGIG,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""I'm on record defending Uwe Boll's original Bloodrayne. You can look it up. I argued that if Boll's name wasn't attached to it, most people would probably chalk the film up as a trashy, gory B-movie guilty pleasure. Now, having endured this clot of a follow-up, I'd like to formally retract my goodwill. Boll found a way, turning in a talky picture that eschews sustained action for overlong dialogue between Clint Howard and Michael Par. In between these jumbo expository exchanges--delivered with line readings that would make an adult film star laugh derisively--you have smatterings of action and sleaze. There's plenty more stupidity to delve into, but I'll spare you. All that needs to be understood is this: the action is terrible, the acting is laughable, the T&A is too ridiculous to titillate, and Rayne never wears form-fitting leather.""",1310256000,,885,5.110344827586207
4488418,3,B004WOAGIG,"At best, BloodRayne: The Third Reich is a silly bit of alternate history hokum as the Nazis hope vampirism will help make them the master race. That being said, the action sequences are fairly well-executed and appropriately visceral with plenty of the red stuff splashing about. BloodRayne probably won't win Boll any new fans but it is a harmless time waster that should be a SyFy Channel staple in no time.

""Making of BloodRayne: The Third Reich"" is a fairly amusing look at the mad methods of Uwe Boll and the cast and crew that love him. Clearly the actors are aware of the kind of film they're doing and don't take it too seriously. Say what you will about Boll but he comes across as a savvy filmmaker who knows what he wants.

In ""Interview with the Writer,"" Michael Nachoff talks about his work on the film. He did a little bit of historical research but basically saw Rayne as a gunslinger akin to Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven (1992). Nachoff also talks about his writing routine, rewriting, and so on.

Also included are the official and alternate trailers.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Uwe Boll and writer Michael Nachoff. As you would imagine, Boll dominates the track and does not disappoint. He always envisioned a trilogy with this film set in World War II much like the video game. Unlike the Underworld and Resident Evil films, Boll didn't want to simply repeat what he had done before and instead tackle different genres with each installment. Not afraid to speak his mind, the director dishes on the two lead actors hooking up during filming and why he couldn't cast Kristanna Loken (she wanted too much money) in this film. He also criticizes the tough working conditions on all three films (i.e. a drunken Michael Madsen on the first one and a train station blowing up in the second one) on this admittedly amusing and entertaining track.",1309824000,32,1883,4.714285714285714
4488419,2,B004WOAGIG,"""The locals are piling up outside, so let's just make this short and bloody.""  Rayne is back, and this time she is trying to stop Hitler from being injected with her blood and becoming immortal.  For those that have seen the other two movies there is really no intro needed for this movie.  For those that haven't...Rayne is a half-man/half vampire that fights against full vampires.  After watching the first two movie in this series (1st one I suffered through, and the 2nd I couldn't finish) I was not looking forward to this one.  For those that know who Uwe Boll is you will know what I mean when I say he has a certain style (mostly meaning horrible movies).  The opening to this one was actually almost like a real movie, great music, camera work and made you want to keep watching.  Then about 20 min in you remember what made the first two bad and brought you back to earth.  This is pretty much badly choreographed fighting mixed with a lot of blood and nudity, a lot of nudity.  Once again it seems like a good idea falls very, very short and this movie is a struggle to get through.  As you may have noticed I start each review with a quote from the movie that sums up what it is about.  The only one that was applicable is one that contains short and bloody.  To be fair this is the best one (film making) wise of the three.  Overall, If you are going to watch any of this series this one is the easiest to get through.  That's about it.  I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - Nope

4488420,1,B004WOAGIG,"This is a movie about vampire Nazis killed by a katana-swinging medieval chick. There is NO excuse for it to be this bad.

But yes, ""Bloodrayne: The Third Reich"" really IS that bad, combining everything that was wretched about the last two movies and adding plenty of new idiocies of its own. Unerotic sex, slapdash action scenes, a plot crammed with filler and starring Natassia Malthe's breasts, this is an exercise in bored ineptitude... or, in other words, an Uwe Boll movie.

During World War II, Rayne (Malthe) has taken to slaughtering Nazis at the camps, when she isn't hanging around a bordello getting naked massages. However, some of her blood was splattered on Commandant Brand (Michael Pare), right after she stabbed him, and he soon rises as a vampire. So the sadistic Dr Mangler (Clint Howard), a cut-rate Mengele clone, decides to take his vampire research further.

Rayne is horrified (or mildly confused, if you go by Malthe's expression) by this discovery, and she soon realizes that Mangler is planning to inject vampire blood into Hitler to make him immortal and nigh-unkillable. So she teams up with the local Resistance (populated by a bunch of undeveloped people whose names I can't remember), and tries to eliminate the vampires before Hitler grows a pair of fangs.

""BloodRayne: The Third Reich"" is just as silly as the first movie, and as devastatingly dull as the second. And since this is Uwe Boll, there's lots of explicit gore, silly fight scenes, stupid plot holes (those Nazis don't hear a guy being killed TEN FEET BEHIND THEM?!) and unintentionally hilarious dialogue (""I am the prodigal son of the Third Reich! I am power incarnate... OOF!"").

But don't worry, NONE of that is half as campily entertaining as it sounds. The story is painfully limp, and it sort of oozes by slowly -- most of it is just the Commandant and Dr. Mangler plot world domination, while Rayne hangs around with the Resistance doing... nothing much. It takes FOREVER for her to actually start fighting the bad guys.

However... that is STILL not enough. So Boll crams the movie with filler -- REEEAAALLLY LOOOONNG softcore lesbian sex scenes, Vampire Hitler dreams, and whole SUBPLOTS that exist merely to take up time. What is the point of the codebreaker Magda again, except to eat up ten minutes of running time and never be mentioned again? Don't be silly, there IS no point!

And you know the movie is full of fail when the best-developed character is a Nazi lieutenant. Natassia Malthe is awful as usual -- she looks, acts and sounds like a whiny teenage girl, especially since she spends much of the movie squeaking at the doughy Resistance leader. She does have two qualifications, though -- and both of them are CONSTANTLY on display.

It takes a special brand of horribleness to wreck a VAMPIRE NAZI movie, but Uwe Boll managed it. ""BloodRayne"" completes the trifecta of vampire wretchedness, so don't watch it except for a MST3K weekend.",1306627200,11,2958,4.85515873015873

I think they didn't stay true to her character which made the action a slashing film kinda stagnant an one dimensional, it's not bad it's actually the most entertaining out of all the three films just as a fan it's left undesirable an not as memorable as rayne should be. They did use her character nicely with some funny one liners espielly at the end, an for the fans the lesbian sex scene was pretty hot.

4488606,1,B004WOAGIG,"Sitting at home, off work sick and going out of my mind, I was looking for a horror movie to watch so I could occupy my mind for a little while. I found notorious director Uwe Boll's 2010 movie Bloodrayne: The Third Reich. Now, I cannot say that I wasn't warned. I'd been told it'd be rotten. Did I listen? No...

To me, the premise sounded like fairly standard horror fare and let's face it, you can't really go wrong when you turn Nazis into something even more evil, right? WRONG.
The film starts off promisingly enough with a plot template already in place from the successful computer game it is based on, decent special effects, reasonably well-coreographed fight scenes (if a little on the short side), an 18 certificate allowing for plenty of gore, Clint Howard hamming it up as the evil Nazi doctor and a smoking hot lead actress in the form of Natassia Malthe.

Unfortunately, these are the only decent points for the movie and in my submission, is not enough to raise the movie above the bar to an even acceptable level. There is little in the way of preamble for this movie and we are thrown straight into the action. Perhaps you need to watch the first two movies or have a passing acquiantance with the game on which it is based; I have done neither of these things and have no intention of remedying that situation.

There are two parts of the movie that are entirely gratuitous and unnecessary scenes of softcore porn, adding nothing to the story or the depth of the characters. I am acutely aware of how prudish that sounds but the inclusion of these scenes left me totally baffled.

I'm not going to get embroiled in a discussion regarding Uwe Boll's credentials as a ""film maker"" as we all know exactly what his films are like, simply watch Far Cry, House of the Dead or anything he has ever done and you'll know his films are...less than beloved.

Other than Clint Howard (of Evilspeak and brother of director Ron Howard) and Michael Pare, I recognised none of the cast of this movie.

There were points where I felt that the movie was taking a turn for the better. However, these were far outweighed by the low points such as a vampire Hitler turning up in a dream sequence and the fact that Pare's voice unfortunately reminded me of Joey from Friends when he says ""Doctor Drake Ramore!"" and at no point during this movie even attempted any kind of faux German accent. Poor show.

Don't be fooled by the DVD cover at the top of the page either; there is no assault on Berlin and no undead army marching through the Brandenburg Gate. The movie is filmed on location in Croatia and the climatic roadside battle between Rayne and Pare's vampire nazi is sorely disappointing, over far too quickly and perhaps encapsulates the entire movie; soulless, all style and no substance.",1352678400,,2794,4.5648702594810375
4488607,1,B004WOAGIG,"Well the only power evident here is the power of the stench that this terribly BAD film gives off!
""BloodRayne-The Third Reich""(released Nov/10)....what can one say about this stinker? I have not sat through a watching experience like this since Woods'""Glenn or Glenda"";and some may even consider that a few notches above this one. Natasha Malthe stars as the lead Rayne,dressed to the hilt in black leather,push up bra and with a voice not dissimilar to Mila Jovovich(intentional?).Her co stars are Ron Howard's younger brother Clint as a German Scientist(definitely the acting vet of this entire company)and with Brendan Fletcher as Nathaniel,the partisan leader. I last saw Brendan in Freddy vs Jason some years ago;a movie 3 stars better than this.
The plot,such as it is,finds us in Western Russia,I would guesstimate either in /42 or /43. Rayne is a vampire but working on the side of good,ie.she's very anti-Nazi. During a fire fight with some German soldiers at a train station she impales their leader,then bites him. Well that one incident is the catalyst for the rest of the film. The Nazi leader of course comes back to life,thanks to Rayne(you would have thought she would have known better),and working in tandem with a German scientist,he starts to turn his subordinates into vampires also;an army of the undead he wants to take back to Berlin and show off to Der Fuehrer.
Well Rayne,with the help of the local partisans will have nothing of this. However the Germans learn of the partisans hideouts and later in a firefight in a warehouse the partisans and Rayne get captured. Rayne and Nathaniel are sitting in a lorry being driven to the train station for deportation to Berlin,when the rest of the partisans jump the convoy and free them. The film ends as we see the group back in the saddle again stealthily entering a concentration camp and taking on the Nazi contingent there;helping the allies gain freedom over this German scourge.
Go Rayne!......not. The film last barely 72 minutes....and to have gotten through it at all says alot about what this reviewer won't do for YOU,the dear reader. I think I should put in for a purple heart after all this,what do you think? Now I must say the acting here wasn't as bad as the stars that rate this charade would have you think. They all did the best they could with what they had,but what they had was miniscule. The dialogue and action is SO predictable as to be see through. For example,there is a scene where the scientist is playing chess with the vampire commandant. When the scientist says""checkmate"",the German picks up a glass. Now who doesn't see a glass being crushed by hand as a sign of anger coming? No one. And if you want your sexual thrills thrown in,and what writer/plot that cannot think of something in the very least intelligent to impart doesn't,this is a good one. Rayne goes one on one with a female bordello employee. Later she switches over and goes at it with Nathaniel in the back of the lorry they're being taken to the train station in. Riiggght. Oh yes,the piece'de resistance?The ""Germans"" all talk with an American accent,almost to a man. We're not surprised.
I see the budget on this bomb was about $10 million. Hmm. This film was done in Croatia during,I would guess,the winter of 2009/10. Since we don't have any Meryl Streep's or Clint Eastwood's about,I would guess the majority of the budget went for heaters,as it did look pretty darn cold. What else could explain an exorbitant budget like that....for this? It was obviously filmed in digital,which is much cheaper than film, one giveaway being its look. The backgrounds are much clearer,in fact the eye can see everything better,which leaves it up to the cameraman to adjust his types of shots. And now that you know the""plot"",the money sure didn't go into the writing either.
Technically speaking the film is in a w/s a/r of 1:78:1. The extras include a featurette,commentary,trailers,and an interview with the writer;now THAT would be interesting to watch! Oh yes,for you masochistic types,there is a digital download,also.
Well,here is where I usually stick in my recommendations,but there aren't any. If you see this DVD in any way,shape or form anywhere,even if someone GIVES you a copy free,treat it like it has the bubonic plague virus all over it....and run like heck!",1347580800,,4336,4.876693766937669
4488608,3,B004WOAGIG,"In looking at the DVD box I wonder if Bloodrayne was wearing any panties, after watching the ""B"" quality movie, I guess the answer is ""No."" Natassia Malthe, being a dancer by trade is a natural for the graceful moves of Bloodrayne. However the movie has moved into solid ""B"" territory. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was Clint Howard in his role as Dr. Mangler. What was that accent? Could his lines and acting have been worse without being campy?

After a very quick introduction as to who is Bloodrayne (BR), the movie jumps quickly into a fight scene with BR helping the ""resistance"" kill Nazis. The resistance don't have any accents, so it if hard to tell who they are, but they cook things slowly like the French. During the fight, a Nazi gets a taste of BR's blood and becomes a vampire himself. BR has a nightmare where a Hitler with a large nose bites her.

The ending was a bit of a let down. Bad plot. Bad dialogue. Bad acting. Good nudity.

4488609,1,B004WOAGIG,"Much has been written about a prolific German director/producer/writer Uwe Boll and his works. To such question as ""Who is the worst film director currently making movies?"" his name always pops up. Actually, not every film he makes is that terrible, but watching ""BloodRayne: The Third Reich,"" the third installment of the ""BloodRayne"" franchise, makes me think so.

Based on a video game series, ""BloodRayne: The Third Reich"" follows an adventure of a dhampir named Rayne (Natassia Malthe), a half human half vampire heroine who inadvertently turns a high-rank Nazi officer Brand (Michael Par) into a bloodsucking monster. For a low-budget action adventure, the storyline itself is serviceable, and the costume and production designs are acceptable, if not very original. Some may enjoy watching a scenery-chewing turn from Clint Howard as an eccentric doctor ""studying"" vampires.

Still, ""BloodRayne: The Third Reich"" is a bad film. Or I should say it is more dull than bad. The film is not even guilty pleasure. Action sequences are few and far between and they are not thrilling, poorly shot and choreographed. Much of the screen time is spent on expository dialogue. But the worst part is Rayne, a vampire huntress who should be more seductive. Those who are expecting some heroine like Kate Beckinsale's Selene will be disappointed.

In 2009-2011 Uwe Boll directed three feature-length films a year and some of them (like ""Rampage"" and ""Attack on Darfur"") are fairly well-received. I sometimes think: ""Why doesn't he just slow down and spend more time and money on one project?",1333324800,2,1583,5.17578125
4488610,3,B004WOAGIG,"I've seen altogether too many vampire exploitation flicks.

High points: campy fight sequences, plenty of skin if that's what you're looking for, and a few very decent actors. Down side: some really awful acting from some and a script that keeps trying to reach way above its capabilities.

I'd recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the genre, just don't expect continuity or a great deal of logic when it comes to the vampires.",1321920000,,686,6.221052631578948

4488613,3,B004WOAGIG,"""BloodRayne: The Third Reich"" is a fairly mild 2010 film of vampire genre that has nude lesbian cunnilingus, several open displays of bordello sweater meat, a ninja style woman who eviscerates enemies via swords or knives, and has a very interesting version of an optional way for beheading a vampire.  The gore is not all that impressive for a seasoned veteran of any category of violent films, and the nudity more than likely is the part more for adult viewing than is the violence or gore.  There's some occasional vulgar language, but nothing seems overdone except for the inclusion of Hitler's regime (German soldiers and German officers speaking flawless English with no accent or brogue whatsoever) and World War II time period, with some compelling images of anti-Semite prejudice, animus to the point of misogyny, and not much depth for the newcomer to be introduced by explanation to the BloodRayne theme. The lead protagonist is Natassia Malthe, as BloodRayne, the dhampir.  The creepiest thing about this film is Clint Howard, who has been in films, TV series, and the theater since the 1950's (over 200 production titles for his appearances).  He plays an egocentric, myopic, experimentation surgeon in ""BloodRayne: The Third Reich.""  But there's really not much overall substance here for a contemporary offering, and I'm guessing censorship must have left the majority of the good stuff on the cutting room floor.  The villains are easy to hate, and the heroine easy to appreciate; but for this to be acclaimed as the best of the three BloodRayne films, writer Michael Nachoff and director Use Boll need some serious creativity here.  They have incredibly beautiful sets to work with (filmed in Croatia), and beautiful women too.  This film cannot be given more than 3 stars, and that is generously given based upon the gratuitous displays of eye candy.  Ten million dollar production budgets don't buy much for films these days, but I'm guessing Natassia Malthe has a promising future in her acting career (I know I'd like to see her again).  I'm a visual fan of the BloodRayne genre, and have no interest in the books or video games, therefore my opinion of the film is independent of any long term multi-exposure to otherwise provided details separate from the DVD inside this artwork wrapped plastic case.  I have to agree with a few reviews I've seen that say this film is destined for B-movie cult fan base bins for campy stuff that mixed the beautiful with the ugly, the pleasure with the torture, and fairly good acting with really, really horrible acting.  Could have been great if the mix was kept closer together instead of the extreme ends of the spectrum.  Horse feces and perfectly outdoor grilled steak side-by-side on the same plate don't make for an appetizing meal.",1317168000,4,2798,4.952991452991453

4488615,4,B004WOAGIG,"I just got a blu-ray player, and so far this is the best looking blu-ray film I've seen.  The sharpness and colors are incredible.  I expected a lot of graphic violence because of the picture on the box with Rayne sporting those two big swords, but the fight scenes involve no dismemberments and just one instance of a victim losing his head--usually Rayne swings her sword at a victim from behind and the guy falls with a lot of blood squirting out.  Probably the limited budget prevented the violence from being more graphic.  Michael Pare and Clint Howard as the demented doctor give excellent performances.  Natassia Malthe looks great in  one scene where she's wearing a thin pink short satin robe at a bordello and she goes upstairs to beat up a client who is hitting one of the prositutes.  The plot which involves Nazis and vampires is something you might expect to see on Elvira's movie macabre.",1315008000,4,904,4.6835443037974684
4488616,5,B004WOAGIG,"All-right, people can say I'm crazy but the Bloodrayne movie series rocks just as the games do (look out for the upcoming Bloodrayne: The Shroud video game). Each movie has a different time setting, but this one is by far the most interesting. Any little mistake, such as over-the-top silliness with gore, or slow pacing, has been corrected from prior movie mistakes.
This one also is most like the games, but almost takes the material slightly more seriously with shots of Nazi's and Hitler looking like documentary stock footage. The general ""Ekhart Brand"" holds a lot of elements from various generals in ""Bloodrayne"" the video game. The look of the film is very well done, from the costumes, especially Rayne's, who gets several different, well-designed outfits.
For random elements, Bloodrayne has a love interest who doesn't leave or die, Nazi's are killed endlessly, Bloodrayne makes out with a lesbian gypsie, and more Nazi's die. A scientist resembling real-life Adolf Hitler's doctor is ever-present and very wierd.

Both Uwe Boll and Paul W.S. Anderson deserve much credit for jumpstarting video-game to film, and they still both hold the best video-game franchises: Bloodrayne and Resident Evil respectively. Also look out for upcoming ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" in Sept. 2012, as well as Uwe Boll's ""In THe Name Of The King: 2 Worlds"" and even a promised ""Bloodrayne4!""",1314748800,10,1384,5.178571428571429
4488617,1,B004WOAGIG,I enjoyed the first two BloodRayne films - this one had potential - but it was never realized.

The Third Reich has plenty of nudity,blood,and gore that will keep any fan of the Bloodrayne movies very satisfied. I am one of the biggest BloodRayne fans in the world between having both video games,all three movies,and a tattoo of BloodRayne on my back and can say even with all the so-called flaws that people have pointed out I still liked this movie very much. The nazi's believe that if they can use Rayne's blood they can create a unstoppable force of nazi vampires to win the war and take over the world. Rayne meets up with a resistance group that shares the same dislike of the nazi force. When she impales the nazi commander through the heart she spills some of her blood on him and he becomes a vampire himself. Rayne must now stop him and the nazi's with the help of the resistance before they reach Berlin to grant Hitler immortality. There are two main sex scenes with BloodRayne having a lesbian sex scene while towards the end she has a romp with the resistance leader. Natassia has one of the best looking body's around with some of the best cleavage you'll ever see. I know most people consider this a B movie along with the other two,but if you are a true fan of BloodRayne you will take the good with the bad and still appreciate BloodRayne being one sexy as hell,nazi slicing,kick-ass half vampire half human vixen that will set your heart racing.

4488619,3,B004WOAGIG,"In looking at the DVD box I wonder if Bloodrayne was wearing any panties, after watching the ""B"" quality movie, I guess the answer is ""No."" Natassia Malthe, being a dancer by trade is a natural for the graceful moves of Bloodrayne. However the movie has moved into solid ""B"" territory. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was Clint Howard in his role as Dr. Mangler. What was that accent? Could his lines and acting have been worse without being campy?

After a very quick introduction as to who is Bloodrayne (BR), the movie jumps quickly into a fight scene with BR helping the ""resistance"" kill Nazis. The resistance don't have any accents, so it if hard to tell who they are, but they cook things slowly like the French. During the fight a Nazi gets a taste of BR's blood and becomes a vampire himself. BR has a nightmare where a Hitler with a large Jewish nose bites her.

The ending was a bit of a let down. Bad plot. Bad dialogue. Bad acting.  Good nudity.

Well the third movie finally falls into the nazi era like the video game, which in itself to me was a plus. This is a typical B movie action/horror and fans of the genre will most likely enjoy watching this for the ""B"" factor. I feel this is the best of the three movies and it is watchable and somewhat enjoyable without being painful.

4488622,1,B004WOAGIG,"As a huge fan of the first BloodRayne video game, I was somewhat interested to see that Uwe Boll had finally decided to place the character BloodRayne into the historical setting of WWII. I wish I had not been interested. I think I would actually prefer a frontal lobotomy to having even the slightest interest in seeing this film. I cannot un-see BloodRayne: The Third Reich. I will gladly try and save you from this trauma.

First, the only similarities between BloodRayne the video game and BloodRayne: The Third Reich are the historical setting of WWII. That's it. Do not fool yourselves.

Secondly, without boring you with a complete synopsis, let me simply give you some quick comparisons: Your cousin's dance recital that your Mom forced you to attend? It had better production values than BR:TTR. The Drama Class you took in college for the easy ""A""? It had better acting than BR:TTR. The porn you found in your Dad's closet when you were 13? It had better directing than BR:TTR. The Battlestar Galactica fan fiction your little brother wrote, that starred himself? It had a more coherent and story driven plot than BR:TTR.

This is NOT a film that is ""so good it's bad"". It's just bad. It's just horrible. It's the cinematic equivalent of ""being chased by a pack of wolves while your dentist tries to perform an emergency root canal without pain killers"" type of bad. A single star is a thousand times more merciful than this film deserves.

Do not EVER purchase this film. Not as a joke. Not because you're a cinematic masochist. Not because you think it's ""cult classic"" type of material. Because if you do, you're encouraging Uwe Boll to continue producing and directing, and then you are part of the problem. May whatever god you worship have mercy on your soul.

Bloodrayne: The Third Reich is so laughably horrible that even schlockmaster extraordinaire director Uwe Boll should be ashamed of himself here.  The acting is so atrociously bad that it makes one wonder just how limited Boll was in his time to do various takes of certain scenes, for every scene in the whole thing just feels like it was filmed in one or two takes.  The action scenes are incomprehensible, and the gore effects are laughably bad.

But yes, ""Bloodrayne: The Third Reich"" really IS that bad, combining everything that was wretched about the last two movies and adding plenty of new idiocies of its own. Unerotic sex, slapdash action scenes, a plot crammed with filler and starring Natassia Malthe's breasts, this is an exercise in bored ineptitude... or, in other words, an Uwe Boll movie.

During World War II, Rayne (Malthe) has taken to slaughtering Nazis at the camps, when she isn't hanging around a bordello getting naked massages. However, some of her blood was splattered on Commandant Brand (Michael Pare), right after she stabbed him, and he soon rises as a vampire. So the sadistic Dr Mangler (Clint Howard), a cut-rate Mengele clone, decides to take his vampire research further.

Rayne is horrified (or mildly confused, if you go by Malthe's expression) by this discovery, and she soon realizes that Mangler is planning to inject vampire blood into Hitler to make him immortal and nigh-unkillable. So she teams up with the local Resistance (populated by a bunch of undeveloped people whose names I can't remember), and tries to eliminate the vampires before Hitler grows a pair of fangs.

""BloodRayne: The Third Reich"" is just as silly as the first movie, and as devastatingly dull as the second. And since this is Uwe Boll, there's lots of explicit gore, silly fight scenes, stupid plot holes (those Nazis don't hear a guy being killed TEN FEET BEHIND THEM?!) and unintentionally hilarious dialogue (""I am the prodigal son of the Third Reich! I am power incarnate... OOF!"").

But don't worry, NONE of that is half as campily entertaining as it sounds. The story is painfully limp, and it sort of oozes by slowly -- most of it is just the Commandant and Dr. Mangler plot world domination, while Rayne hangs around with the Resistance doing... nothing much. It takes FOREVER for her to actually start fighting the bad guys.

However... that is STILL not enough. So Boll crams the movie with filler -- REEEAAALLLY LOOOONNG softcore lesbian sex scenes, Vampire Hitler dreams, and whole SUBPLOTS that exist merely to take up time. What is the point of the codebreaker Magda again, except to eat up ten minutes of running time and never be mentioned again? Don't be silly, there IS no point!

And you know the movie is full of fail when the best-developed character is a Nazi lieutenant. Natassia Malthe is awful as usual -- she looks, acts and sounds like a whiny teenage girl, especially since she spends much of the movie squeaking at the doughy Resistance leader. She does have two qualifications, though -- and both of them are CONSTANTLY on display.
