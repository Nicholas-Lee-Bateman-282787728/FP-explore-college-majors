This DVD was a great help. It guides you through choosing finish, customizing finish, different techniques to apply finish, ways that you can make your materials last longer, and get the finish you want sooner.

Another thing that is very important but easily overlooked is safety. The WoodWhisperer discusses safe methods for storing finish and disposing of used rags. One of the menus has the option for either an in-depth explanation or a brief overview. This feature definitely came in handy. ""A Simple Varnish Finish"" is a real treasure.",1322179200,,646,4.91743119266055
