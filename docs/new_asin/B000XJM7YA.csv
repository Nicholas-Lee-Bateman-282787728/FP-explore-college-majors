It mentioned Steve Maxwell and I researched him on the internet.  It turns out that Steve is a Jiu-jitsu specialist and I'm an beginning Jiu-jitsu student.  I have a neck injury from a previous bicycle accident from triathlon training.  I focused solely on Steve's neck portion and it has helped tremendously.  I have more flexibility, less tightness, and better range of motion.  It is hitting the point where I'm almost where I was physically before the bike accident.

They key here is control, I think it would be very easy to injury yourself by doing some of these exercises the wrong way.  Maxwell repeated warns the viewer about respecting your pain threshold, but because he's in such good shape the exercises sometimes look easy, so I highly recommend working yourself into some of the more exotic exercises rather slowly. After some cautious practice, when done correctly these exercises are obviously beneficial to the body, you can get a sense of what's healthy and unhealthy movement in some of the more unusual ranges of motion. For someone who doesn't do any submission grappling, it's important to know that some of the movements are based off of submission holds (which he mentions) and the original intention of the holds is to destroy the joint, anyone with grappling experience would know what is a safe range and an unsafe range, so please go very slowly.  Once you develop a feel for this, the exercises are perfectly safe.  He covers almost all movable joints from head to toe, and you also train coordination and balance.  This is a very unique and beneficial series for most anyone, but particularly so for contact sports especially wrestling and grappling.  I highly recommend it.",1204675200,38,1954,4.835329341317365

I am more flexible and less injury prone.  This dvd set offers many exercises where you can select your own favorites and make a personal routine that suits you.",1203120000,7,316,4.709090909090909

3004397,5,B000XJM7YA,"It is exactly what it says. An Encyclopedia of Joint Mobility. It comes in 3 DVDs with each DVD broken down by body parts. From neck to spine, hands, wrists etc. Steve Maxwell roughly spends about 25 minutes on each body part which is easily over 4 hours of mobility exercises.

The DVDs are broken down by the body. From top to bottom. Going from neck, shoulders, arms, etc down to the toes. Each section Steve begins with standing stretches for each body part and then he goes down to the floor and shows you other stretches on the floor. It is an enormous amount of stretches and you can combine whichever exercises you want. Some are so simple and beneficial that you can do while driving or waiting for an elevator.

I love these DVDs and recommend them to everyone! Mobility will help with longevity!",1412380800,,806,4.513698630136986
3004398,5,B000XJM7YA,"So far so good. I do a lot of jiujitsu and have tight hip flexors, so I'm hoping it will help me keep flexible and strong.",1403654400,,122,3.730769230769231
3004399,5,B000XJM7YA,"I purchased this DVD a week ago to address multiple back and spine problems from jiu-jitsu (two herniated disks in my neck, one in lumbar). I knew of Steve Maxwell through jiu-jitsu circles, and decided to take the plunge after hearing him twice on the Joe Rogan Experience. In short, I cannot recommend this DVD enough. In one short week I've noticed a substantial  improvement  in my neck with respect to mobility, stiffness, and pain. I've also experienced a significant decrease in lower back pain. I'm excited to see the impact this DVD will have a few months down the line, once I've created a daily routine.

As other reviews mentioned, this is an encyclopedia. Some sections may seem a bit overwhelming with respect to the number of movements. Others are relatively short. My best advice is to pinpoint your areas of need, watch a dry run of that section, and slowly implement the movements you feel are feasible for your needs and abilities. Over time, you can slowly work up to the more advanced movements. Depending on your needs, you can probably develop a decent routine that takes no more than 10 minutes out of the start or end of your day.",1402012800,,1155,4.679802955665025
3004400,4,B000XJM7YA,Boy! this guy gives you so much with this DVD. All the way from small standing movements going thru each joint down to torquing about on the floor in amazing contortions. I do the first part of each section with my woman's group (all of us over 60) and it's quite a workout for us plus a joint lubricator. It's just a shame to not be able to just play all the easier stuff with the push of a button. Though he is consistent with how he starts each section slow so it's easy to just stop and start the next segment. Great for old ladies with arthritis!,1400630400,5,551,4.111111111111111
3004401,5,B000XJM7YA,"Steve Maxwell shares his proven experience with performing joint mobility exercises to help over come joint problems and to maintain joint health and overall physical health. I have had great experience with Pavel Tsatsouline's Super Joints book and dvd on joint mobility. Pavel recommends Steve Maxwell's teaching on joint mobility so I purchased this one from Steve and was not disappointed. As with all training programs you need to assess what applies to you at the moment and not get side tracked on an everything approach. Even if you are not experiencing any joint problems at the moment, it is a great way to maintain joint mobility and prevent joint problems especially as we age. So stay active and perform the joint mobility exercises that apply to you and you will benefit from doing your preventative maintenance on your ""wonderfully and fearfully made body"" by God who loves you and wants you to enjoy Him and your life to the fullest.  God Bless.  Doug.",1361404800,3,968,4.896341463414634
3004402,5,B000XJM7YA,"I am not kidding when I say that. I am a big fan of Steve Maxwell and have been following his training philosophies for a long time. This dvd is perfect for anyone that wants to learn mobility drills, it is not a defined or set workout however. It is 3 dvds worth of some of the best mobility exercises I have used. After watching all of the dvd's I created a program based on my own needs that I follow on non-workout days and when ever I need a little rehab,(I have had 2 knee surgerys and low back issues). Not only does he show you tons of great exercises but the detail for each is very thorough as well",1359158400,9,608,4.033057851239669
3004403,5,B000XJM7YA,"I am a physician, who likes to keep active.  Over the years I've lifted weights, rock climbed and studied jiujitsu.  I came across Steve Maxwell from Pavel and Mike Mahler's kettlebell DVDs and other materials.  I purchased this DVD because I had chronic pain in my neck and shoulder.

My neck had bothered me for 6 months, likely from practicing headstands and jiujitsu.  Steve's series on neck gliding was the missing piece of rehab for me.  He introduced me to movements that strengthened my neck by stabilizing my cervical vertebrae and increasing my range of motion.  After 2 weeks of consistent work I was pain free, plus thicker neck muscles an added bonus.

My shoulder a more complicated problem.  I've had impingement, rotator cuff tendinitis and AC joint sprain all in the same shoulder.  This is from years of bench pressing with too much ego sprinkled with some general wear and tear. I've had two cortisone injections which alleviated some of my pain.  However, doing a daily routine of selective exercises from the DVD has brought my shoulder back to about 95%.

Also, the completeness of the DVD is impressive.  I really can't say a enough about this DVD or Steve Maxwell. He's the real deal.  For anyone who want's to continue to be active in life these movements are essential.  Thanks Steve.",1354492800,14,1310,4.811659192825112
3004404,5,B000XJM7YA,This is the second video of his I bought. I actually prefer the 300 kettlebell challenge to this one. If it says Steve Maxwell it is worth getting.,1352937600,,147,4.285714285714286
3004405,4,B000XJM7YA,"This DVD has some really good information.  I use some of these exercises for warm-up and sometimes as correctives.  But the production value is pretty low.  So...if you want a glitzy presenation, this will not impress you.  If you train seriously and want some supplemental exercises to help stay mobile and possibly break dysfunctional movement patterns, you will probably get a lot out of this DVD.  It's nice that Steve Maxwell goes through some progressions on these exercises, too.",1351209600,,487,5.113924050632911
3004406,5,B000XJM7YA,"As a geezer, this is my favorite instructional DVD set for keeping up full range of motion, everywhere in my body. I have not seen better. Like Jack LaLanne, I do daily maintenance and prevention so I don't become like many of my peers I notice and wince at. Or at least not as soon as them. They're all the motivation I need to make the time to exercise as a habit, and to stay away from unwanted physician or chiropractor visits. Maxwell is the real deal and knows what he is talking about and doing. He has the agility and strength and leanness, at age 54, that many would like to develop. He's the voice of experience, including recovery from injuries. (I have a compression fracture and now no residual noticeable effects.) There is no superfluous yak in the DVDs to pad the time: they're solid, nonstop instruction with demos and all the necessary do's and don'ts.

Fortunately, there is no ridiculous and grating exciting garage band music inserted as in so many exercise videos, I guess to induce ""excitement"" in teenage boys.

Unlike one reviewer, I see zero ""jarring to the eyes.""  I'm watching it right now on a 42"" Viera plasma TV, played on a Toshiba DVD recorder/player, and it looks great. Sharp, crisp, true color, and looks the same in slow-motion or stills.

BTW, I also give five stars to Maxwell's Ultimate Upper Body Workout DVD. I don't know about any of his other DVDs, so cannot say, but this one also is outstanding and solid content with no time-filler baloney. If you don't have a set of rings, it will make you want to install them on a hanging bar from your ceiling, as I did, after using the Mobility DVD reviewed here. Or get some rings and take them to a playground or anywhere you have a tree limb or high bar. After about age 50, Nature is not on your side and doesn't care. You must do countermeasures and make the time each day or week, rather than make excuses, or you will end up like your broken-down peers that you see everywhere. A free-will choice we each make.",1338595200,4,2003,4.46448087431694

3004408,5,B000XJM7YA,"I heard about Steve Maxwell through Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and knew he was a fitness guru but never really looked into his work. I have had bad hip, wrist, and knee pain for years from sports and decided to look into this DVD. Man am I glad I did!! I've gone to doctors and they took x-rays, and MRI's but only told me that I couldn't really do anything except take supplements for the pain. Which I did. Fish oil, glucosamine helped a little bit but not really. I pull patients at work all day and some days I sit in a chair all day. This does a number on my low back and over time I was just a stiff, painful mess. Doing these exercises I felt immediate benefit the first week. Some of the movements I feel pretty silly doing but it is well worth it for how you feel afterwards. You can't knock this until you try it, I 100% recommend this to everybody.",1327881600,,852,4.13855421686747
3004409,5,B000XJM7YA,"To mirror what I experience daily in my practice ( I am a physician and a triathlete, so naturally my patient population comprises both the bread-and-butter traditional internal medicine and the athletes ), most people  do not come to you until they sustained some kind of injuries ( couting myself ). Steve Maxwell did what we called preventive medicine, thoughtfully , no frills, no gimmicks , honest and pure work.  The excercises shown require some dilligent practices, repetitions, bland-as-it-can-be but highly effective preventive maneuvers. Exercises are to be done as frequently as possible , some are easy, some are tough. I can not recommend this any higher than five stars simply I ran out of stars.
The only minor dent is the visual quality : with today high definition pictures, I do think the visual can be enhanced with a better quality camera, it is just a fair price/quality ratio consumers deserved. It can be jarring to the eyes. If you look for pounding music to go along, look elsewhere.
Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in conditioning and injuries prevention . The practicality and the educational values of this DVD trumped all the shortcomings I mentioned above.
And my thank you to you, Steve.",1327276800,12,1233,4.980582524271845

I suggest you start with the easier ones and then add on as you progress. What's nice is that you can make your own routine based on your individual needs. I have a shoulder issue so I tend to spend a bit more time on these. If you're pressed for time, you can work your whole body in about 10 minutes. Keep in mind, the focus is joint mobility not muscle stretching. Although your muscles will certainly benefit from the movement, joint mobility is different but equally important. There are many parts which connect our bones, including cartilage, ligaments, tendons, etc. As we age, these parts tend to be neglected usually by under use but sometimes by overuse of a particular movement. The idea is to regain your full range of motion. You can use these exercises to improve your joint health and decrease the likelihood of developing joint problems in the future. If you already have joint problems, these exercises may help alleviate the symptoms. The bottom line is that there is something beneficial here for everyone.

This is a very unique and beneficial series for most anyone, but particularly so for contact sports especially wrestling and grappling.  I highly recommend it.",1204675200,38,1954,4.835329341317365

I am more flexible and less injury prone.  This dvd set offers many exercises where you can select your own favorites and make a personal routine that suits you.",1203120000,7,316,4.709090909090909

3238894,5,B000XJM7YA,"It is exactly what it says. An Encyclopedia of Joint Mobility. It comes in 3 DVDs with each DVD broken down by body parts. From neck to spine, hands, wrists etc. Steve Maxwell roughly spends about 25 minutes on each body part which is easily over 4 hours of mobility exercises.

The DVDs are broken down by the body. From top to bottom. Going from neck, shoulders, arms, etc down to the toes. Each section Steve begins with standing stretches for each body part and then he goes down to the floor and shows you other stretches on the floor. It is an enormous amount of stretches and you can combine whichever exercises you want. Some are so simple and beneficial that you can do while driving or waiting for an elevator.

I love these DVDs and recommend them to everyone! Mobility will help with longevity!",1412380800,,806,4.513698630136986
3238895,5,B000XJM7YA,"So far so good. I do a lot of jiujitsu and have tight hip flexors, so I'm hoping it will help me keep flexible and strong.",1403654400,,122,3.730769230769231
3238896,5,B000XJM7YA,"I purchased this DVD a week ago to address multiple back and spine problems from jiu-jitsu (two herniated disks in my neck, one in lumbar). I knew of Steve Maxwell through jiu-jitsu circles, and decided to take the plunge after hearing him twice on the Joe Rogan Experience. In short, I cannot recommend this DVD enough. In one short week I've noticed a substantial  improvement  in my neck with respect to mobility, stiffness, and pain. I've also experienced a significant decrease in lower back pain. I'm excited to see the impact this DVD will have a few months down the line, once I've created a daily routine.

As other reviews mentioned, this is an encyclopedia. Some sections may seem a bit overwhelming with respect to the number of movements. Others are relatively short. My best advice is to pinpoint your areas of need, watch a dry run of that section, and slowly implement the movements you feel are feasible for your needs and abilities. Over time, you can slowly work up to the more advanced movements. Depending on your needs, you can probably develop a decent routine that takes no more than 10 minutes out of the start or end of your day.",1402012800,,1155,4.679802955665025
3238897,4,B000XJM7YA,Boy! this guy gives you so much with this DVD. All the way from small standing movements going thru each joint down to torquing about on the floor in amazing contortions. I do the first part of each section with my woman's group (all of us over 60) and it's quite a workout for us plus a joint lubricator. It's just a shame to not be able to just play all the easier stuff with the push of a button. Though he is consistent with how he starts each section slow so it's easy to just stop and start the next segment. Great for old ladies with arthritis!,1400630400,5,551,4.111111111111111
3238898,5,B000XJM7YA,"Steve Maxwell shares his proven experience with performing joint mobility exercises to help over come joint problems and to maintain joint health and overall physical health. I have had great experience with Pavel Tsatsouline's Super Joints book and dvd on joint mobility. Pavel recommends Steve Maxwell's teaching on joint mobility so I purchased this one from Steve and was not disappointed. As with all training programs you need to assess what applies to you at the moment and not get side tracked on an everything approach. Even if you are not experiencing any joint problems at the moment, it is a great way to maintain joint mobility and prevent joint problems especially as we age. So stay active and perform the joint mobility exercises that apply to you and you will benefit from doing your preventative maintenance on your ""wonderfully and fearfully made body"" by God who loves you and wants you to enjoy Him and your life to the fullest.

3238899,5,B000XJM7YA,"I am not kidding when I say that. I am a big fan of Steve Maxwell and have been following his training philosophies for a long time. This dvd is perfect for anyone that wants to learn mobility drills, it is not a defined or set workout however. It is 3 dvds worth of some of the best mobility exercises I have used. After watching all of the dvd's I created a program based on my own needs that I follow on non-workout days and when ever I need a little rehab,(I have had 2 knee surgerys and low back issues). Not only does he show you tons of great exercises but the detail for each is very thorough as well",1359158400,9,608,4.033057851239669
3238900,5,B000XJM7YA,"I am a physician, who likes to keep active.  Over the years I've lifted weights, rock climbed and studied jiujitsu.  I came across Steve Maxwell from Pavel and Mike Mahler's kettlebell DVDs and other materials.  I purchased this DVD because I had chronic pain in my neck and shoulder.

My neck had bothered me for 6 months, likely from practicing headstands and jiujitsu.  Steve's series on neck gliding was the missing piece of rehab for me.  He introduced me to movements that strengthened my neck by stabilizing my cervical vertebrae and increasing my range of motion.  After 2 weeks of consistent work I was pain free, plus thicker neck muscles an added bonus.

My shoulder a more complicated problem.  I've had impingement, rotator cuff tendinitis and AC joint sprain all in the same shoulder.  This is from years of bench pressing with too much ego sprinkled with some general wear and tear. I've had two cortisone injections which alleviated some of my pain.  However, doing a daily routine of selective exercises from the DVD has brought my shoulder back to about 95%.

Also, the completeness of the DVD is impressive.  I really can't say a enough about this DVD or Steve Maxwell. He's the real deal.  For anyone who want's to continue to be active in life these movements are essential.  Thanks Steve.",1354492800,14,1310,4.811659192825112

3238902,4,B000XJM7YA,"This DVD has some really good information.  I use some of these exercises for warm-up and sometimes as correctives.  But the production value is pretty low.  So...if you want a glitzy presenation, this will not impress you.  If you train seriously and want some supplemental exercises to help stay mobile and possibly break dysfunctional movement patterns, you will probably get a lot out of this DVD.  It's nice that Steve Maxwell goes through some progressions on these exercises, too.",1351209600,,487,5.113924050632911
3238903,5,B000XJM7YA,"As a geezer, this is my favorite instructional DVD set for keeping up full range of motion, everywhere in my body. I have not seen better. Like Jack LaLanne, I do daily maintenance and prevention so I don't become like many of my peers I notice and wince at. Or at least not as soon as them. They're all the motivation I need to make the time to exercise as a habit, and to stay away from unwanted physician or chiropractor visits. Maxwell is the real deal and knows what he is talking about and doing. He has the agility and strength and leanness, at age 54, that many would like to develop. He's the voice of experience, including recovery from injuries. (I have a compression fracture and now no residual noticeable effects.) There is no superfluous yak in the DVDs to pad the time: they're solid, nonstop instruction with demos and all the necessary do's and don'ts.

Fortunately, there is no ridiculous and grating exciting garage band music inserted as in so many exercise videos, I guess to induce ""excitement"" in teenage boys.

Unlike one reviewer, I see zero ""jarring to the eyes.""  I'm watching it right now on a 42"" Viera plasma TV, played on a Toshiba DVD recorder/player, and it looks great. Sharp, crisp, true color, and looks the same in slow-motion or stills.

BTW, I also give five stars to Maxwell's Ultimate Upper Body Workout DVD. I don't know about any of his other DVDs, so cannot say, but this one also is outstanding and solid content with no time-filler baloney. If you don't have a set of rings, it will make you want to install them on a hanging bar from your ceiling, as I did, after using the Mobility DVD reviewed here. Or get some rings and take them to a playground or anywhere you have a tree limb or high bar. After about age 50, Nature is not on your side and doesn't care. You must do countermeasures and make the time each day or week, rather than make excuses, or you will end up like your broken-down peers that you see everywhere. A free-will choice we each make.",1338595200,4,2003,4.46448087431694

3238905,5,B000XJM7YA,"I heard about Steve Maxwell through Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and knew he was a fitness guru but never really looked into his work. I have had bad hip, wrist, and knee pain for years from sports and decided to look into this DVD. Man am I glad I did!! I've gone to doctors and they took x-rays, and MRI's but only told me that I couldn't really do anything except take supplements for the pain. Which I did. Fish oil, glucosamine helped a little bit but not really. I pull patients at work all day and some days I sit in a chair all day. This does a number on my low back and over time I was just a stiff, painful mess. Doing these exercises I felt immediate benefit the first week. Some of the movements I feel pretty silly doing but it is well worth it for how you feel afterwards. You can't knock this until you try it, I 100% recommend this to everybody.",1327881600,,852,4.13855421686747
3238906,5,B000XJM7YA,"To mirror what I experience daily in my practice ( I am a physician and a triathlete, so naturally my patient population comprises both the bread-and-butter traditional internal medicine and the athletes ), most people  do not come to you until they sustained some kind of injuries ( couting myself ). Steve Maxwell did what we called preventive medicine, thoughtfully , no frills, no gimmicks , honest and pure work.  The excercises shown require some dilligent practices, repetitions, bland-as-it-can-be but highly effective preventive maneuvers. Exercises are to be done as frequently as possible , some are easy, some are tough. I can not recommend this any higher than five stars simply I ran out of stars.
The only minor dent is the visual quality : with today high definition pictures, I do think the visual can be enhanced with a better quality camera, it is just a fair price/quality ratio consumers deserved. It can be jarring to the eyes. If you look for pounding music to go along, look elsewhere.
Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in conditioning and injuries prevention . The practicality and the educational values of this DVD trumped all the shortcomings I mentioned above.

3238911,5,B000XJM7YA,"This is aptly titled as the ""encyclopedia"". There are enough exercises here to keep you busy for hours. I suggest you start with the easier ones and then add on as you progress. What's nice is that you can make your own routine based on your individual needs. I have a shoulder issue so I tend to spend a bit more time on these. If you're pressed for time, you can work your whole body in about 10 minutes. Keep in mind, the focus is joint mobility not muscle stretching. Although your muscles will certainly benefit from the movement, joint mobility is different but equally important. There are many parts which connect our bones, including cartilage, ligaments, tendons, etc. As we age, these parts tend to be neglected usually by under use but sometimes by overuse of a particular movement. The idea is to regain your full range of motion. You can use these exercises to improve your joint health and decrease the likelihood of developing joint problems in the future. If you already have joint problems, these exercises may help alleviate the symptoms. The bottom line is that there is something beneficial here for everyone.
