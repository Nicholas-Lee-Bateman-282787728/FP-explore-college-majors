8630040,1,B00H4ZEHVW,NOVA is a great programming but not when they star individuals like Geoff Marcy who was being investigated for his actions. This video should not even make a penny.,1444953600,,164,4.689655172413793
8630041,4,B00H4ZEHVW,Love this show. I bought it to use with my biology class. I was disappointed that there were some problems with the DVD. I will have to download it if possible from PBS in order to play it for my class.,1439164800,,202,3.951219512195122
8630042,5,B00H4ZEHVW,"This episode of Nova is based on the findings of the Kepler space telescope that was designed to detect planets around other stars.  It found over 3000 probable planets in orbit around other stars -- and ground-based telescopes are still being used to try to confirm them.

There is some speculation as to whether they really exist, but they make a very good case.  Astronomers can detect a dimming of the star's light and, if that dimming returns at regular intervals the most likely explanation is a body in orbit around it, a dark body -- a planet.

But the discussion doesn't end there.  They try to determine just what kind of planets these are:  are they big, small, rocky, gaseous?  This is a little more speculative but, once again, they make a pretty good case because the kind of information they can glean from the data can determine size and mass.

Then they go another step, a much more speculative step and try to ascertain whether or not there might be life on these planets and, if so, how they might look, how they might live, etc.  This is really pushing the envelope but, if you bear in mind that it is speculation, you won't go too far wrong.  They may very well be wrong, but they may be right.  That's one of the things that future research will have to look into.  As one expert points out, it is good science in that it reminds us that all life has to take into account the laws of physics and chemistry:  they might turn out to be very different from what the experts are guessing, but at least they get us thinking.",1429401600,2,1541,4.402826855123675

""Hundreds of billions of stars in our Galaxy.  And yet we know only of one that shines on a life-filled planet.  Is Earth unique?  Or are there other solar systems and planets like ours out there?  Now, scientist are finding the answer.

Thanks to this: The Kepler Space Telescope [KST].  The most powerful planet hunter ever built.  It's making astonishing discoveries.  From enormous gas giant [planets] to a land where the sun never sets to worlds that may be entirely covered in water.  Kepler is even finding planets like our own.

Scientists are beginning to wonder if these planets could be inhabited.  And if so, by what?

This is the story of how one spectacular spacecraft has brought us closer than ever to answering [humankind's] ultimate question:

ARE WE ALONE?""

The above is what the narrator say in the preview of this spectacularly interesting documentary.

(The KST is named after Johannes Kepler (1571 to 1630).  He was a mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer.  A major figure of the scientific revolution, Kepler is best known for his laws of planetary motion.)

NASA's Kepler Space Telescope mission has identified 3500 planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. (These are called extrasolar planets or exoplanets.)  This documentary explains:

(1) How exoplanets were found
(2) Which exoplanets may be Earth-like
(3) If any of these Earth-like exoplanets are suitable for LAWKI (life as we know it)
(4) Through educated speculation, what life on those Earth-like exoplanets might look like.  (The last 8 minutes is concerned with this.)

This documentary has excellent animation as well as brief commentary by astrophysicists and astrobiologists.

Finally, the DVD (released in 2014) has English subtitles but no extras.

In conclusion, this is a superb documentary.  The one main thing you will learn from this film is:

""WITH SO MANY EXOPLANETS OUT THERE, PROBABLY WE'RE NOT ALONE.""

8630044,4,B00H4ZEHVW,"This documentary shown on NOVA tells the story of the Kepler Space Telescope and its search for earthlike exoplanets. Kepler found 3500 potential planets in a small patch of sky near the constellation Cygnus. Ultimately Kepler is looking for extraterrestrial life, so it is interested in planets that are the right distances from their stars so that liquid water can exist. Not too hot, not too cold! It is assumed that alien life will obey the laws of chemistry and physics. It is also assumed that the elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen will play an important role along with self-replicating DNA molecules. Planet hunter Geoff Marcy turns up. There could be trillions of planets in the Milky Way.",1398902400,2,711,4.983193277310924
8630045,3,B00H4ZEHVW,"This doc asks if there are habitable planets out there.  Specifically, it states that a telescope launched a handful of years ago captured photos of the millions of stars out there, plus their environs.  The work said a habitable planet would have to be small and Earth-like, rather than big and gassy like Jupiter.  The brightness of its orbital star plays a role, with most stars not having the brightness of our sun.  Only certain planets can have atmospheres.
I think ppl will be fascinated by hearing about black trees with fanlike leaves, land whales that scoop food passively.  They even imagine a Snuffaluffagus (sp?) creature on alien planets.  Still, the work may be a wet blanket for some.  First, it said if there is life, many of these planets will only have bacteria.  Then, it said even more complex life may not be highly intelligent life.  The work never mentions ""Star Trek,"" but I think many viewers really want to hear that there are Vulcans and Klingons out there.  That doesn't really happen here.  Some viewers may ask if we can move to these planets if we screw Earth up too bad.  Well, some of these planets are all water.  The work never suggest some advanced race could be living in these watery environs.
This doc made me think of two things.  First off, there's a documentary out there that lists all the factors which would make travelling to Mars impossible.  They include radiation, a lack of fuel, a lack of food, meteors that could tear apart spaceships, etc.  Well, if we can't get to Mars, then we would REEEEAALLY not be able to visit these Earth-like planets any time soon.  Second, recent reports say that an organization is working to take some ppl to Mars, with the understanding that they will NEVER return home.  Some scientists have replied that astronauts have said being in outer space gave them headaches and diarrhea and such.  Thus, the implication is that no one could live on Mars for a long time; our bodies are only equipped for Earth and even our neighboring planet is just too, too much.  Thus, this discussion is about things that won't happen for centuries, if at all.",1391212800,,2125,4.67654986522911
8630046,2,B00H4ZEHVW,"This Nova episode presents the basic facts regarding the Kepler planet hunter space telescope and some of the extrasolar planets it revealed. These may be summarized in a few words: 1) it looks for planetary transits by detection of stellar dimming, 2) a rough estimate of the planet's size may be determined from the amount of dimming and 3) the rough distance from the planet's parent star may be estimated by measuring the planet's period of revolution. In other words, any layperson who knows anything about the Kepler mission is not going to learn much of anything new from this documentary.

The show is so much more disappointing because fully half of its airtime is devoted to pure idle speculation about the mere possibility of having discovered planets that ** might ** possess liquid water. That, and conjectures about what alien life might be like.

For the record, let it be understood that Kepler has NO capability of detecting water (liquid or otherwise) or atmospheres. It merely measures the brightness of the star being investigated. The way the show is written, and the showmanship of Geoff Marcy, misleads the lay viewer into believing that the telescope CAN detect water and atmosphere. Over and over again we hear speculative qualifiers such as ""the bet is..."", ""possibly..."", ""it could be that..."", ""as far as we know..."" etc. etc. This is not science. This is the same as the ancient Greeks musing about what the world might be made of (air, water, fire, earth or love and hate or elephants stacked atop one another, etc. at least Democritus got it approximately right).

Obviously the intent here is to titillate the public with fanciful imaginings of extraterrestrial life, much as similar presentations have sought to do with the Mars rovers and the SETI project (which NASA thankfully had the good sense to abandon funding with taxpayer monies). This show, like those others, is meant to build up enthusiastic support for the continued funding of these projects among the uneducated, easily excitable public.

Even more disappointing is the fact that there is good, interesting, hard scientific information that could have been presented in place of all the dross regarding ET. For one, Kepler is only capable of detecting planets that have orbits that pass between their stars and the telescope. There are relatively few possible orbital planes that do so. There must be many many more stars whose mean planetary planes DO NOT produce observable transits; in other words, planes with high angles of inclination to the solar ecliptic. But this is not mentioned in the documentary. It would be very interesting to know the ratio of observed stars that show transiting planets to the stars that DO NOT produce transits.

Even more interesting, but omitted in the show, is the fact that engineers are now planning more advanced planet hunter telescopes with more sensitive detectors that can block out the light from the star and directly detect the very faint light reflecting off extrasolar planets. These new telescope will be able to detect ALL extrasolar planets that do not orbit very close, not just the ones that transit. Too bad there was no time left in the show to mention this fact because they spent so much airtime speculating about water worlds and ETs.

Also, some information can be gleaned from carefully studying the data produced as the planet crosses the limb of the star. This is a murky area in my knowledge base because not much has been published about it in the popular press; too bad the Nova crew didn't take the time to research this aspect of Kepler and let us all in on it.

As this is the first review posted on Amazon, I can only imagine the 5-star reviews pouring in from the uninformed public about how great and interesting this Nova episode was. Well, all I can say is that  those who happen to know a bit about extrasolar planet hunting and the Kepler mission will find this show an empty letdown. Could have and should have been a good show. Two stars.",1389657600,6,4016,4.8525547445255475
