Great movie, very enlightening for the non-professional.  The added bonus dvd is something every Thoroughbred trainer should view again and again.",1314576000,3,276,4.978260869565218

8068064,5,B0009WFFT0,"The movie gives an excellent insider look at the jockey profession and surrounding information about racing horses.  Nicely balanced to provide a glimps at many different aspects of the life of a jockey - many questions people would have are answered in a story telling presentation that kept us interested the entire time. Several knowledgeable people are interviewed to illustrate different views of people in the horse racing industry. The title is a little misleading: it is not the story of one jockey but a movie about many jockeys who all get to speak.  The audience gets information about the stories of several jockeys.  I like it better that way actually.  Entertaining and informative.  Very nicely done.  If you are curious about a jockey's life, what they go through and why they do it, this is a good movie for you.",1290470400,5,829,4.843971631205674
