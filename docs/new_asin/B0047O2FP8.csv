8418260,3,B0047O2FP8,"A pretty good war yarn in World War I in Kurdistan the British are battling Kurds.  Two brave officers find themselves in love with the same woman.  Claude Rains is her husband, who had to leave her for three years after only being married for a week.  He still loves her.  He saves Cary Grant's neck and brings him back wounded to a hospital and then returns to action.  The wife, now a nurse, nurses Grant back to health and the two fall in love.  A love triangle in the middle of the war.  While this plot is common among war movies of the time, this was done very well and both men come off very courageous.  You have to get a kick out of Grant with a mustache.  Anyone familiar with these old movies know how often the male leads would have a mustache, but this is the only time I can think of offhand that Cary Grant did.",1408320000,,827,4.11875
8418261,4,B0047O2FP8,"If you're a fan of this rousing WWI desert action/romance (starring a jarringly mustachioed Cary Grant), know that you needn't settle for an overpriced MOD copy: 'The Last Outpost' (3 1/2 stars) is also available on a fully mastered disc as part of Universal's '10-Movie War Collection'-- a real bargain containing fine prints of several classics, some never before released on DVD.",1371340800,5,382,5.17741935483871
8418262,4,B0047O2FP8,"I am an avid Cary Grant fan and will watch any movie that he is in. I purchased this DVD for that reason. I have never heard of this movie.
This is definitely a gem found in the desert! There is enough action to keep it interesting, but relies heavily on the outstanding acting abilities of the two main stars, Cary Grant and Claude Rains. If you like movies such as Gunga Din, and Only Angels have Wings, then you will enjoy The Last Outpost.",1368057600,3,443,4.223529411764706
8418263,4,B0047O2FP8,"Pre-stardom Cary Grant and Claude Rains are British soldiers in World War I.  Cary Grant is a charming playboy type who can't seem to keep his eyes off the ladies... particularly if the ladies already belong to other men.  Captured by Afghani troops, he has every reason to think he will be executed, until the mysterious Mr. Smith (Claude Rains) spirits him out of the prison and off on a dangerous mission to rescue an Afghani tribe in danger of massacre.  Injured in the ensuing escape, Grant ends up in the military hospital in Cairo... where he falls in love with a married nurse.  Conveniently-- but unbeknownst to Grant at first, Nursie is married to Mr. Smith, the man who saved his life.

Cary Grant, young, mustached, and devastatingly handsome, really only sort of feels his way through this film, but it's clear that the lovable rogue playboy character suited him well.  The true revelation here is Claude Rains-- a man typically thought of as elegant and urbane is thoroughly convincing as a swashbuckler and heroically single-minded intelligence officer.  He's tough in this film, rough and tumble and at times very cagey and clever.  He's also a man in love with his wife, a woman he hasn't seen in over three years... and when the truth of her ""affair"" with Grant comes out, one look into Claude's magnificently expressive face tells you she's just ripped his heart out by its roots. For once (and unlike Grant and Rains' next outing in ""Notorious"") I was not rooting for Cary Grant to win the day.

The film has plenty of war-time action, several amazing set pieces, and enough grit to hold the attention of most war movie fans, even if the effects seem primitive-- and despite the filmmakers' use of recycled footage from silent films (which are all too easy to spot, given the different film speeds).  The romance angle was contrived and not convincing in the least, but I may have to attribute that to my prejudice toward Claude Rains, who, as far as I'm concerned, is the greatest and most underrated character actor of all time.  His Mr. Smith (not the character's real name, by the way) is the man you root for, the one you know will save the day, and the one you hope will have the happily ever after.

Considering the film was made in 1935, considering Cary Grant was just finding his footing as a leading man, and considering the love story was less than satisfying, I give ""The Last Outpost"" four stars, on the strength of Claude Rains' acting alone.",1319068800,6,2477,4.6689655172413795
8418264,4,B0047O2FP8,"Cary Grant as a youngster in this movie, but you can still see the body and facial moves that made him a Star!  Who ever said Claude Rains was a short dumpy guy and would never make it as a ""ladies man""; needs to take another look.  Not only is he good looking, but he acted circles around the younger Grant.",1304899200,6,308,4.032786885245901
