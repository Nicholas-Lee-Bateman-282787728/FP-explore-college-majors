8717424,2,B00Y250IZ6,"I waited 6 months to buy this movie, hoping someone would review it.  Finally it had a momentary price drop so I thought would risk it. I noticed now the price is back up. The short Amazon review didn't sway me one way or the other.  If you keep reading my full review you might think there are plot spoilers here.  But before you can have ""plot spoilers"" you have to have a plot. While researching the director, David Prior on IMDB, I found out, he sadly died in 2015, after making this movie 2015.
The basic plot following Amazon's review is the old, used and reused, plot found in any of the following movies. A group of people hunting a person or persons for sport: Buy or rent one of them instead.
The Most Dangerous Game (1932 Joel McCrea)
Open Season (1974 William Holden)
Deadly Prey (1987) also written and directed by David Prior. The only one in my list that I have never seen. Twenty-seven years later maybe he was trying to reshoot this one with a female lead. Who knows.
Hard Target (1993 Jean Claude Van Damme)
Surviving the Game (1994 Ice-T)
Naked Fear (2007 Joe Montegna)
Beyond the Reach (2015 Michael Douglas)
Back to the plot, or plot holes, of which there were many. Maybe he hadn't finished editing the movie at the time of his death and someone else finished it up???  That would account for a very weird plot among other things.  Or maybe it was just a bad movie.
The heroine runs an MMA school and is supposedly a bad ass intelligence agent. When her daughter comes up missing on a camping trip she goes after the responsible parties.  I am very critical of lousy martial art fights in movies and these were not well done. (I say this as I have spent the last 56 years studying and teaching karate and other martial arts.)  There is, however, one interesting incident with a female villain and a Bowie knife. The rest of the fight scenes look like slap-boxing by teens in a locker room.
All the while she is running from the hunters in the woods she manages to construct more booby traps that a Seal Team could have completed in a week. The director seemed to be trying to kill more people in a large variety of violent ways with more different implements than Jason would use in a Friday the 13th movie. Just about the whole cast ends up dying savagely - all but one character who was easily predictable.
Eric Roberts (he must have owed the director a big favor or really needed the money) is the only big name star in the film.  Sadly, he is only on screen in a couple of scenes which have nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the plot.  Then you don't see him anymore - so he gets to survive. He does, however, manage to slip in a great moment of violence.
The acting: none of the characters seem to really care about the roles.  Even Eric could have phoned his part in on his Apple.
The sad part is, with a bit more effort, this could have been a decent film for its genre.
