The video details the ""sweet"" side of playing the blues or even rock for that matter. Rather then learning from a scale to key point of view the video goes into how to play through the cords and hit all the right notes at the right time, something a lot of us guitarists have a problem with. The video also goes into intros, turnarounds and blues phrasing, again another thing many guitarists are guilty of not paying enough attention to. I have recommend this video as well as step one of this series to all my friends who play not only blues guitar but rock, jazz and country. It is just that solid of a video.  On a side note I have purchased videos from many other guitarists and unfortunately many of them seem impressed with themselves or are great guitarists but crummy teachers, this series is both informative and humorous. More than worth twice the money.",978480000,16,1000,4.524861878453039
