8159805,5,B0009F4YZI,"There is a level of tension and violence brewing just under the surface of this little known, but interesting early 40s movie that attempts to combine swing music with a plot about gangs and guns. Much of the film is clearly an excuse to get swing music on the screen and sell tickets, but the plot that is generated around the music works well in a ""scarface"" kind of way. What makes it intersting is that you can watch the film either way - just for the music or just for the plot - without losing much by ignoring the other aspects. The drama itself is fairly predictible, but the subtle dialogue more than  makes up for that.",1148342400,,629,4.330508474576271
8159806,5,B0009F4YZI,"""There is no mistaking the serious tone of Murder on Lenox Avenue, but I still found it immensely entertaining. The swing music is authentic and full-blooded, and I found that this timeless feature film could touch me even after all these years. What an experience to see it now, almost fifty years after I first caught it as a kid at the local Cinerama...""",1146528000,,357,4.59375
