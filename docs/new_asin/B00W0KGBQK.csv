After feeling the presence of qi, I understand how qi IS the vibrant energy that allows grace to function within the body + body field extending out to the world. My anger is typically tied to pain and tension in my body, yet just a little fluidity and qi motion is needed to release body tension and ease my anger.
-This is my first Qi Gong video + I use it quite often. Highly recommended; low impact exercise (standing poses) suitable for all ages. Hope to get my family into a little qi gong, especially my mother who suffers some joint pains.",1532390400,,691,4.40625
