2048770,5,B0001ZX0EW,"In September 1986 a show was born with such a sharp satirical witt that the small screen could not contain it.  This short lived comedy was on par with ""police squad"" and ""airplane"" when it came to timing and all out obsurdity.
  The shows opening set the tone for the 30 minutes to follow: A man is threatening to jump from a ten story building.  Sledge ,not being one to talk someone down, ends the stand-off by blowing the building up.
  I have been trying to get these episodes for years and I would recommend them to any fan of the naked gun series, airplane, etc........PURCHASE & ENJOY",1081209600,2,592,4.435185185185185
2048771,5,B0001ZX0EW,"We have all, that is the true Sledge fans, been waiting for this.  We can thank Alan Spencer for his hard work in getting all the orginal Sledge Hammer episodes onto DVD, with help from a petition.  This show started in the 80s and was about a cop that liked kicking the bad guys butt- in a comical and brutal way.  Sledge Hammer was the guy to cuff his suspects to the bumper of his car and drag them around the parking lot to make them talk.  All the characters are great, and the story line is always funny.  If you enjoy comical police brutality, this is a set of DVDs to check out!
If you like brute cop force, with lots of humor, you should check this out.  Trust me, I know what I am talking about!",1080950400,2,705,4.072463768115942

2048813,5,B0001ZX0EW,"i once heard someone say that the best sitcom characters are always ""horrible."" i wouldn't go quite that far. after all, it has given us everyman characters (Rob Petrie, Hawkeye Pierce), lovable characters (Herman Munster, Mary Richards), and even the occasional hero (Maxwell Smart, The Fonz). still, it has indeed proven an equally fertile ground for the less admirable (Eddie Haskell, Archie Bunker) and even the less ethical (Dan Fielding, Edmund Blackadder). life is famously full of ironies, but it's hard to imagine a more ironic irony than the one reflected here: character traits we would find obnoxious if not reprehensible in a personal acquaintance, we somehow tolerate, might even relish, once they've been filtered through the art of storytelling.
it's highly unlikely that the sitcom hero will ever get farther afield from the ""appropriate"" stereotype than it did with Inspector Sledge Hammer. a straight-laced parody of Dirty Harry, Sledge (David Rasche) confides in his gun and takes pride in the ""excessive force"" for which he seems to spend roughly two thirds of his career on suspension. he has little tolerance for the ""scumsuckers"" and ""genetic mistakes"" who's criminal enterprise keeps him and his fellow officers in business. (this reflects one of the more poignant and/or controversial points of Dirty Harry, the notion that the recent introduction of the Miranda rights protected criminals' rights at the expense of victims' rights.) he's as nilhilistic, sexist, and chauvinist as a person can get without actively joining the Ku Klux Klan, and his one great fear is World Peace.
creator Alan Spencer frequently sings the praises of what is indeed the greatest series in American television history, Get Smart. his veneration is perceptible, but not simply appropriated, in the character dynamic. when Maxwell Smart had Agent 99, Sledge has Dori Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin). both cover for their partner's bumbling, but where 99's motivation is a straightforward crush on Max, Doreau has noted some talent in Sledge and so is trying to shift his focus to his job and away from his gung-ho borderline psychopathy. (not that there isn't a similar will-they-or-won't-they factor.) in a few other reviews i've discussed what's known as The Dr. Watson Effect, under which that antisocial weirdo Sherlock Holmes could put just about anyone off, but comes off as having his good, admirable qualities after all, chiefly for having won the loyalty of the more relatable Dr. Watson. Dori Doreau could well be the purest case of The Dr. Watson Effect since Dr. Watson himself.
likewise, where Max had the Chief of CONTROL, Sledge has Captain Trunk (Harrison Page). they share a tendency to get exasperated with their unorthodox underlings, but not the reasons for their forgiveness. where the Chief has developed such a regard as to more than once describe Max as like a son to him, Trunk barely tolerates, in fact actively dislikes, the trigger-happy Hammer. the Chief will occasionally scold or lecture Smart, but Trunk actually screams at Hammer on a regular basis. (of course, if the simply overzealous Max and the downright reckless Sledge were to trade places, their respective bosses' dispositions would no doubt transpose as well.)
standout episodes include the introductory episode ""Under The Gun,"" ""Desperately Seeking Dori,"" ""State Of Sledge"" (Harrison Page's favorite episode), ""Dori Day Afternoon,"" ""Hammer Gets Nailed,"" and ""The Spa Who Loved Me,"" which was intended as a farewell raspberry to the button-down network bureaucrats, only for the series to be renewed for a second season. (as Spencer put it, this was his Springtime for Hitler moment: ""where did i go right?"") there are plenty of hit movie pastiches, of which ""Magnum Farce"" is the one that comes closest to Spencer's initial inspiration. (note to the hopelessly obtuse: Magnum Force, the second Dirty Harry film.) one of the most revered episodes, a lampoon of Witness called (what else) ""Witless,"" is worth the price of admission if only for the priceless moment where Sledge slams a thug over the head with his gun butt, intending to knock him out but only managing to give him a headache.
(but alas, there is, conversely, at least one overrated episode as well. maybe it's just due to my opinion that Elvis Presley is the single most overrated figure in rock (if not music in general) history, but ""All Shook Up"" just left me cold.)
there's also a 5-disk edition of the complete series, but i recommend the Anchor Bay editions of the two separate seasons, if only for Alan Spencer's sardonic but insightful commentaries. this is a remarkably astute chap with many thought-provoking points to make.
not that i always agree with him, mind you. take his militant stand against laughtracks. i'm not saying i necessarily love or insist on a laughtrack, but i don't really get why they generate such scorn, either. all it ever set out to do was create a sense of camaraderie. maybe that wasn't strictly necessary, but it was hardly as malicious as some would have you think.
(i sometimes wonder how it's detractors feel about the other end of the spectrum: if there actually is an audience, should their reaction be filtered out?)
still, it does have to be admitted that a laughtrack wouldn't be appropriate for Sledge Hammer! (this is in fact another reason not to go for the aforementioned 5-disk set: the network initially forced a laughtrack, but Spencer finally talked them out of it. for the first few episodes of that set, said laughtrack is right there in all it's un-glory.)
Spencer is closer to right about by-the-book sitcoms, although he goes a little overboard. he describes his brainchild as ""the sitcom for people who hate sitcoms,"" and takes frequent potshots at the bigger hits which thought decidedly inside the box. he's particularly scornful of Mr. Belvedere, against which he was at one point accused of pursuing a vendetta. i don't agree with his assertion that such series are completely bereft of value, but i must admit i'm not much fonder of them than he is. my own favorite sitcoms tend to be from the '60s, when anything could happen therein. (Gilligan,s Island, The Addams Family, The Munsters, The Monkees, oh, and let us not forget Get Smart.) by the '80s, the sitcom had settled more or less exclusively on the pedestrian living-room or workplace formula. no one was even trying to make a unique sitcom anymore, and if the genre hadn't passed it's prime then it certainly has since, at least in America. (i should strongly recommend to Spencer the U.K.'s Red Dwarf and Canada's Corner Gas.)
so however out-of-proportion Spencer's righteous indignation is, there is something to his grievance. i mean, the Industry's assembly-line steadily churns out such antiseptic cookie-cutter fair for, at conservative estimate, several hundred years straight...but it takes a good 20 years for a worthy successor to Get Smart to come along, and it stays afloat for a scant 41 episodes. how is THAT fair?",1441238400,3,7013,5.067474048442906

2048816,2,B0001ZX0EW,"Okay, I remembered the show and thought it would be worth owning, but unfortunately I ordered Season 2 as well. the show wasn't as funny as I recalled, and as I watched season 2, I remembered WHY the show was cancelled. The pilot episode is good, but by the end of season1, you can see it deteriorate.
The producers message at the beginning of each disc every time you load it into your DVD player may explain why the show went downhill.
Alan Spencer is full of himself, and enamored by his own grandiosity. His opinion is that the audience just wasn't ready for him. David Rasche was only as good as the writing, and the writing got pretty week as the series progressed. The question of why Sledge Hammer
continued on he force is the question that will really drive you crazy as you watch the series. The writing is one dimensional, direction is two dimensional. You must remember the television environment of the 80's to understand why the show failed. I just couldn't give 3 stars to the season 1 set, I mean, it's okay, but not by the end of it TV run. Season 2's premier is kind of amusing, but the premise that it occurs 5 years before he teamed with Doreau ( in the first season) just sets you up for the failure of chronology, the contradicting premise,
and the sustainability of the series concept.
Only order season 1 if you thought you liked the series, but keep your expectations low, it isn't Police Squad - ALSO a warning :
The season 2 set I ordered was from a public library with xeroxed labeling, though it was the genuine discs. make sure the original packaging is included in whichever season you order. If anything hurt or ended David Rasche's career, it was signing up for season two.

It has a decent premise that was inescapably hobbled by its status as a network TV show broadcast in the 80s. I've found so far that many of the jokes seem to fall flat. I can tell when they're *supposed* to be funny, but missing some je ne sais quoi, some vital spark to really give it life.
The main character is somewhat of a bumbling, clueless Dirty Harry. His partner is a smart, sassy, strong '80s woman and his boss is a parody of every high strung hot-headed police lieutenant on TV.
The premise sounds hysterical to read, but in practice there were many ridiculous moments and some great homages to the popular media of the day, but few genuine laughs.

2048888,5,B0001ZX0EW,"After seeing Clint Eastwood as ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan as a young boy, Alan Spencer was inspired to create Sledge Hammer, a spoof about a cop who is in love with his gun, and believes in the virtues of violence.  As a young screenwriter, Spencer had no luck selling his idea, until Eastwood's fourth Dirty Harry film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sudden-Impact/dp/B0015XHQUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sudden Impact</a>&nbsp;(1983) became a hit, and ABC eventually became convinced to back what was guaranteed to be a controversial series.  With Leonard Stern, the co-creator of the spy spoof&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart/dp/B001E0O8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart</a>&nbsp;(1965-70), serving as creative consultant, Sledge Hammer! (1986-88) was an irreverent and outrageous satire, in the vein of Get Smart, Batman (1966-68), and the comedies of Jim Abrams and the Zucker brothers.

Played by David Rasche, Inspector Sledge Hammer borrows liberally from Harry Callahan, as Hammer is also a San Francisco police detective, who carries a non-regulation .44 magnum, and has a penchant for wearing sport coats, bad ties, and sunglasses.  A new kind of hero for the violent 80's, Hammer believes that most problems can be best addressed with violence.  He frequently draws his gun, but fortunately rarely ever kills anyone.  ""Trust me, I know what I'm doing"", is Hammer's ready reply, for anyone who questions his methods.

Hammer is teamed with Dorie Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin), a detective with the looks of a film noir glamour babe, who also delivers some meanass kicks.  Initially, she is shocked and mortified by Sledge's methods, but soon learns to adjust to them.  Doreau provides the voice of reason, which usually keeps Hammer from going too far.  Captain Trunk, Hammer's hot tempered and excitable superior, is played marvelously by Harrison Page.

Comedy is one of the most difficult things to do well, and while not everything is a success, the writing for the series is generally very good, as the various writers manage to maintain a fairly consistent comedic tone, though a variety of situations.  Employing excessive violence to ridiculous levels, but with no one getting seriously hurt, is one of the main tenants, along with lampooning various conventions like the criminal justice system, gun control, and due process of law.

The Hammer/Doreau dynamic is established very early, with Dorie becoming more adept at handling the trigger happy Sledge, as time goes on.  There isn't any romantic element between the partners, as Hammer's best friend appears to be his magnum.  The comedic tone is usually flat and low key, unless Trunk is present, in which case it can sudden spike up to earsplitting levels.

In the pilot ""Under The Gun"", John Vernon, who played the mayor of San Francisco in Dirty Harry, assumes the same role.  When his daughter is kidnapped, the Mayor asks Sledge Hammer to investigate.  An unaired alternate version of the pilot is one of the bonus featured.

Other highlights include, ""Over My Dead Body guard"", where Captain Trunk is scheduled to testify in court, and Hammer is assigned to keep him safe.  Sledge ingests deadly snake venom, and has only hours to live, in ""Miss of the Spider Woman"".  As you might expect, ""Magnum Farce"" is a spoof of the film Magnum Force, as Hammer tries to uncover a group of renegade cops who are executing criminals.  Sledge and Dorie play man and wife, in order to track down a baby selling ring in ""If I Had a Little Hammer"".  ""Desperately Seeking Dorie"" is a unique adventure where Doreau is injured while trying to apprehend a counterfeiter, and her personality changes to a female version of Sledge.  Trunk, Doreau, and Hammer, are among a group of cops trapped in the station by a gang of thugs in ""State of Sledge.

Unsure about whether the series would be renewed, Alan Spencer lets it all hang out in ""The Spa Who Loved Me"", the final episode of the season, which concludes with a bomb exploding and leaving the city in ruins.  Sledge Hammer! did not always hit the mark, and isn't for everyone, but fans realize what a fabulous show it was, boldly and bravely blazing a trail, for more the outrageous television that would follow later.

The image quality of the DVD is decent, but a little soft, fairly typical for 80's TV.  The episodes do not have chapter stops, or subtitles.  Anchor Bay does a terrific job of packaging the set, with liner notes in the form of a police file, and four episode commentaries by Alan Spencer.  The 32 minute featurette Sledge Hammer: Go Ahead, Make Me Laugh!, is a fabulous series retrospective, with appearances by Spencer, and stars David Rasche, Harrison Page, and Anne-Marie Martin.",1351987200,,4814,5.23046875

2048943,5,B0001ZX0EW,"SLEDGE HAMMER! was a show that I wasn't interested in back in the late 80s (yes, I'm old enough to remember!). Not knowing any better, I was more into the normal, fluffy sitcom stuff of the time. Don't get me wrong, I still have a nostalgic remembrance of shows I loved as a kid, but I now appreciate the waaaay before it's time appeal of a show like SLEDGE HAMMER! Lacking a laugh track (all the better for it), this show about a Neanderthal, skewed version of Inspector Dirty Harry named Inspector Sledge Hammer (played to iconic perfection by David Rasche) is, in my opinion, one of the most original TV series ever! Only running for 2 seasons, the show should have definitely lived a longer life.

Set obviously in some unnamed fictional West Coast city (reminiscent of San Francisco), the show is a combinination of sharp satire and over-the-top humor. Being in the 80s, it has a few dated pop culture references, but it avoids them enough to seem still modern. Also, the on-location cinematography and shots of the show still gives it a universal appeal and look. Other than some of the hairstyles and apparel, this show really does not look over 20 years old!

The core of SLEDGE HAMMER! is obviously the superb Rasche, who was born to play the title role (good enough to deserve an Emmy if you ask me!). But Rasche was lucky to have excellent support in the form of the classy and sexy Anne-Marie Martin (as Sledge's smart, uppity partner Dori Doreau) and the stern and boisterous Harrison Page (as Sledge's eternally put-upon Police Captain Trunk). The Sledge-Doreau-Trunk trio had a unique chemistry that really makes the show immensely watchable and enjoyable.

Standout eps of SEASON ONE start with the fast-paced fun pilot ep 1-UNDER THE GUN, with a cameo appearance by veteran actor John Vernon (who played the Mayor in DIRTY HARRY) again playing the Mayor frustrated by crime and criminals; the city is being targeted by a mysterious sniper-assassin (sound familiar?) so he must begrudgingly lift the quick trigger Inspector Sledge Hammer off suspension, but not before pairing him up with profiler Detective Dori Doreau, to nab the killer. The duo get off to a shaky start, but in the end develop a respect for each other, which prompts Doreau to request to be permanently assigned to Capt. Trunk's bureau as Hammer's partner.

Other standout eps (all which pretty much riff on classic films) include 3-WITLESS (hilarious riff set in Amish country), 5-DORI DAY AFTERNOON (fun bank heist ep), 6-TO SLEDGE WITH LOVE (Sledge taking on gangbangers), 7-ALL SHOOK UP (Elvis impersonation ep), 18-DESPERATELY SEEKING DORI (Dori gets to act like Sledge!), 21-JAGGED SLEDGE (Sledge on trial for murdering a mob boss), and the SEASON ONE finale 22-THE SPA WHO LOVED ME (with a crazy ending that forced the show creators to ""jump the shark"" since it was unexpectedly picked up for a second season!).

SEASON ONE is definitely the more daring and unapologetic of the shows 2 seasons. This is one of those shows where it doesn't matter that it didn't go on forever and, in a way, that's probably a good thing!",1289779200,2,3112,4.820224719101123
2048944,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer was undoubtedly the best sitcom of the 80's! It was extremely funny

on the show. In fact, in the episode ""Dori Day Afternoon"" he used his gun to
prevent somebody from jumping off of a building. In the pilot episode - ""Under The Gun"" - he used a rocket launcher that was in the trunk of his car to destroy a building where was terrozing an area of San Francisco. If the sniper was Murdoc
from the tv show MacGyver, he would've found a way to survive. In the episode ""Witless"" he was taking morning target practice by taking a couple of shots at the target on his closet. He shot a guy that was hiding in the closet hoping to cash in on a $1,000,000.00 contract put out on Hammer by Don Philip Sousa. So that guy actually deserved it. Despite his prowess with a gun, Hammer
rarely actually shot anyone.

We need more shows like Sledge Hammer. People watching this show almost never have to worry about who else is in the room when watching it.",1278720000,4,1248,4.329059829059829

Upon re-viewing it I have to say my recollections were overly kind. The  physical humor lacks the inspired lunacy of the ""Naked Gun"" series and the writing lacks the timely intelligence of its ultimate progenitor ""Get Smart"" .David Rasche is a great actor who really captures the tone of the off kilter over dedicated detective,but he just isn't given the material to really let loose. I'm sure the censors of the time  hamstrung this series,and I can only imagine what a cable channell like  HBO could have done with a character like Sledge and an actor like Rasche,but in the end I found most of the humor to be firmly in the ""groaner"" category and after watching the entire first season I don't recall any real laugh out loud moments.

Trunk, who's main gag is losing his cool and exploding in anger at the antics of Sledge, who you can guess is always causing trouble.

 ed ? Certainly Miss. I was in the store when two thugs entered & threatened

 the owner w/ shotguns. @ that time, I drew my Magnum & killed them both.

 Then I bought some eggs, milk & some of those little cocktail weenies...

  Inspector, was what you did in the store absolutely necessary?? Yes, I

 had no groceries @ all...."" this was our 1st glance into the twisted,tact-

 less & chauvinistic world of Sledge the man. We couldn't help but laugh @

his utter disregard of human life! What about the needless violence, such

as when he blew up an entire building to get 1 sniper?  Or, when he made the purse-snatcher beat himself up? Truly in a league all by himself! I was only 12 when the show debuted, but I immediately got the meaning that

 creator Alan Spencer was quietly conveying & I remember almost choking on

 a cup of water, I was laughing so hard ! So sad the original shows have

 to struggle in such a cookie- cutter business(Alan, I share your frust-

 rations!) Sledge Hammer was such a show- kitschy, even somewhat predict-

 able ("" I don't take things lying down"", then passing out on a couch--

 ""Kiss of the spider-woman""), yet it really touched a nerve w/ millions

 of us who have a sense of off-beat humor,like Spencer.  The 1st season

 didn't have much in the way of guest-stars, although John Vernon (best

 known as the mayor in the 1st Dirty Harry movie) did star in the Pilot.

 And who other than Spencer himself is floating in the background in many

 episodes!(That is his hand grabbing the newspapers in the pilot). Let's

 not forget Lewis Arquette (Father of the clan) starring as a ""manynote""

in ""Witless"". What else can be said?  Great acting, great story plots(""All

 shook up"" is one of the most original plots ever!), as well as cool loca-

 tions( a motel w/ Swedish masseuses). Great bonus materials, incl. comm-

 entaries, the ORIGINAL unedited pilot( 10 mins. longer), plus bumpers &

 previews(originally aired on ABC in '86). Here's a treasure hunt: See if

2049019,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer! has to be one of the most hilarious detective spoof shows to ever hit network TV!  David Rasche plays Inspector Sledge Hammer, a trigger happy detective, who loves his gun more than he does women, and who somehow manages to always be the hero, even though he is clumsy, ditzy, sexist, homophobic and has a tendency to say exactly what comes to mind, even if it means he will get shot at / poisoned / beat up more often than not.

His partner Dori Doreau, played by the lovely Anne-Marie Martin, somehow manages to have a deep bond with Sledge, even thought he treats her like a child and constantly lets her knows that she is working in a man's world.  Sledge does harbor a bit of a crush on his partner, however, especially when she launches one of her signature high-heeled high-kicks into a crook's face!  He offers her the ultimate compliment in one episode, ""That's what I like about you, Doreau.  You think like a man!""

Rasche's portrayal of Sledge is incredible because he makes the viewer love the character, even though Sledge should be absolutely despised, given his personality ""quirks"".  The character of Sledge Hammer is completely over-the-top, which is exactly how creator Alan Spencer planned it back in 1986 when the show first went to air.  I liken the show to Airplane meets Dirty Harry, only with much better one-liners.

Sledge: You know what I'm going to do to you? I'm going to stick your head in that microwave and set it on ""sandwich.""

Dori: Hammer, you can't do that!

Sledge: What? There's no setting for sandwich?

Another great asset to the Sledge Hammer! series is Harrison Page, who portrays Captain Trunk.  He mixes the perfect amount of frustrated boss with concerned friend that also helps to make the character of Sledge Hammer endearing.  Scenes with Captain Trunk always offer great laughs.  For instance, watching Captain Trunk's reaction after, during a phone call to the Mayor to let him know that they have the fingerprints of a wanted serial killer on the sugar of a powdered doughnut, Sledge happily consumes the doughnut as the Captain's back is turned to him.  At the end of the same episode, when the Captain has acquired a second serial killer doughnut, Sledge, in true Sledge style, gobbles up the doughnut when he finds it on the Captain's desk, and greets the Captain with a huge, sugar-coated smile when he Captain walks back into his office.

Like the A-Team, no one is ever really killed, even if they are blown up, thrown off of a building, run over by cars, or shot, they are hauled away in handcuffs while muttering at Inspector Sledge.  For a show about a guy who loves gratuitous violence, the show doesn't have a lot of it.  What the show does have is great dialogue, and lots of it.  You will laugh - a lot!  The commentary is just as relevant today as it was in the 1980's.

Sledge:  ""I'm an American!  I don't negotiate with terrorists!""

Besides...  It's Sledge Hammer!  Trust him, he knows what he's doing!",1167177600,4,2987,4.661567877629063

2049046,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer was one of the most creative, humorous, and inventive series to grace the airways in the mid 80's when it seemed as if mediocrity ruled the airways (and perhaps still does!).  I must say that I probably would have never watched the show (as I had a strong misguided loyalty to Dallas) had David Rasche's niece, Camille, convinced me otherwise to give it a fair shake.  Well i am glad that I took her advice way back in my college days in 1986.  From the first show on, I was hooked.  The chemistry between the characters was nearly perfect, as was the comedic timing and direction.  I for one am glad to see this re-issue on DVD, especially sans the annoying laugh-track.  I personally think most shows could do without the canned laughter.  MASH is another show that could have been so so much better without the inane use of the laugh-track.  Anyhow, getting back to the DVD...You will also love the commentary from the show's creator, Alan Spencer, who happens to think just like me!  I love his little tangents on modern politics and culture.

The satire of the media's portrayal of violence was the crux of the show and perhaps alienated some viewers at the time it originally aired.  However, it's a timeless message that, despite the totally comedic element to the show, leaves it's indelible mark on the viewer.  Sometimes important messages about society need to be couched in such a manner.  Sledge Hammer did just that and so much more.  Enjoy this great series nicely presented in the DVD format and join the effort to get Sledge finally seen on the big screen!  A movie idea has been thrown about over the years.  It would be great to see that actually happen.  It's worth adding too that the acting in this series was fantastic...David Rasche could have and should have won emmys for his work had the industry taken this series more seriously during it's brief 2 year run.  ~5 stars~",1135382400,6,1911,4.620178041543027

The series creator claims that the laugh track ""insults the intelligence of the audience"" and so it was removed. I agree that laugh tracks can certainly spoil some TV series but that certainly wasn't the case with sledge hammer. The laugh track on Sledge seemed to add to the ""camp"" factor and was an integrated part of the show. It wasn't there to insult our intelligence it was used like a kind of campy ""rimshot"" to add impact to the Sledge Hammer sense of humor. I own all of the original episodes on VHS with the laugh track and find it much more enjoyable to watch.

DVD reviewers raise all kinds of hell when a series is released with missing music or has been edited in ANY way. Well, I'm here to tell you that this series has been released in an edited form.

The dry wit of this series is what set this series above the pack of ordinary sitcoms and very few have ever done it as well. The show is filled with laughs from start to finish and no machine is needed to tell me that.

The acting on this DVD is also quite exceptional. David Rasche gives a brilliant performance as Sledge, making a violent maniac likeable and comedic. Harrison Page also does a great job as the boss, making the scenes believable and effective.

The commentary by Alan Spencer is just as funny as the shows themselves and it adds wonderful insight to the making of the program.

2049081,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Especially by this mid-80's masterpiece about a loveable lunkhead with an oversized luger. If you like slapstick comedy, overdone like a piece of burnt bacon, then by all means this is your show.

David Rasche played Sledge Hammer like the testosterone-driven maniac that he was, back when testosterone wasn't a bad word. The dim-witted Hammer is aided by the leggy, I mean LOVELY Ann-Marie Martin who's actually the REAL brains behind the duo, much like Maxwell Smart and agent 99 in the 60's classic 'Get Smart'. And like 'Get Smart' no cop show would be complete without the long-suffering boss, played to short-tempered perfection by Harrison Page. But it's precisely Hammer's interaction with the volatile Page that makes this show so funny, as well as his relationship with Doreau, his level-headed, intelligent partner, whom he treats as a rookie (hey, Hammer's a chauvinist pig!) but who actually solves most of the crimes. And did I mention, he talks to his gun?

After watching a few episodes I realized I enjoyed this show just as much as when it first aired. It seems just as fresh as ever, never dated. So if you like over-the-top comedy in the same category as 'Police Squad', do yourself a favor by getting this little gem from the 80's, you won't regret it. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.",1112832000,8,1314,4.8097345132743365
2049082,3,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer is obviously the type of show to generate either undying loyalty or abject animosity, depending upon your point of view.  I remember the show, as a teenager in 1986-87, with great affection.  However, I must admit to being highly skeptical when I saw the DVD release - would it be as fun as I remembered?  My brother, equally skeptical and equally curious to know the answer, killed two birds with one stone and bought this for me as a Christmas present.

First - the good points.  The performances by the 3 main cast members are very good.  They inhabit three very different personality types right from show #1 and the dynamic interplay between the three characters is essential to the best scenes and episodes in the series.  There is at least one scene in every episode with a sublimely funny moment.  As with some other series that are now out on DVD, appreciation of the humour and skill of the actors and writers grows upon seeing the shows together (and without ads and the misplaced laugh track).  One reviewer called this ""the best DVD release of a TV series"" - he's wrong (the Simpsons DVD's are much better), but this release is far better than the average crap that passes for ""extras"" on a TV-DVD.  There are some very nifty extras, including TV spots, 4 hilarious commentaries by producer/creator Spenser, and a retrospective documentary.  Finally, some of the biggest current TV names (e.g., producer Al Jean of ""The Simpsons"" and head director Tom Schlamme of ""The West Wing"") are involved in the series, which points to the quality and edginess of the series in general.

However....  I can't help but compare the show to the short-lived ""Police Squad!""  A show with only 6 episodes will always look better by comparison, but those 6 episodes had more laughs than the entire 22 episode run of Sledge Hammer's first season.  In fact, Sledge Hammer falls into the same trap that many other series have (most notably ""Married... With Children"") - that is, it often goes too far to get a single laugh, at the expense of logic and the story.  Roger Ebert's dictum that true comedy grows organically from the characters and their situations is never better demonstrated than on this show.  While shocking at the time, blowing up a building to take out a single sniper is not funny or shocking on repeated viewings.  However, the logic employed by Hammer, Trunk, and Doreau in trying to dispose of a lit dynamite stick in a small office makes me laugh every time I see it (in fact, I laughed to myself right now writing this description!).  There's just too much setup and too little payoff.  Similarly, the funniest episodes are built around the interplay of the three characters, and the show loses significant momentum when centred on just one of the characters (usually Hammer himself).

Therefore, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the last Police Academy film and 5 being Police Squad!, Sledge Hammer falls somewhere in the middle, so I gave it a 3.  It is truly funny in places (especially when the commentary track is on!), but spends too much time trying for shock value and 1-off laughs, rather than letting the characters and situations drive the comedy.",1111276800,8,3186,4.723327305605786
2049083,5,B0001ZX0EW,"I don't really have a whole lot to add. I just wanted to say that, the dvd is done very well, has a lot of extra. And I want to urge those interested in this set to listen to the audio commentaries, especially the one for the season ending ""cliffhanger"" episode for an interesting treat.

And now that I have your attention, I want to make a personal attack one of the reviewers who've posted before I did. The reviewer who claimed that the 80's over moralization, and sensitivity was of liberal doctrine. Please, that's conservatism at it's finest. The 80's was the age of Reganomics, and ""Just Say No"", which appeared by Nancy Reagan herself on an episode of Different Strokes, one of the shows you mentioned. Sorry..I just get a little angered when people imply a political stance when they don't even know where their ""side"" stands.

The show Sledge Hammer was about liberalism. (Just check out the commentary by Alan Spencer..and various jokes in the program itself) About questioning those ideas of old, and blasting them away with a bazooka. Tv these days have gotten a little too liberal however, where boundaries will soon be non-existant (a little constraint or conservatism is a good thing)..which have lead me to search for those forgot shows of old, that tried to do what others were afraid of doing..being different.

Almost 20 years later, I still remembered so many scenes from this show, like Sledge blowing up the building to get the sniper, almost the entire Witless episode, all sorts of scenes when he's on trial for murder, and of course the season ending cliffhanger.  I still don't know what they did to resolve it the next season, and it's bugged me ever since.  Is that bad?  Regardless, I was dying to watch the show again, and when the DVD came out, I was quite happy.  I wasn't sure it would age all that well, though.  Some villains are pretty weak by today's standards, but the comedy is so dead on, it's brilliant.  There's no way Sledge Hammer would have been made today, in our overly politically correct era, but I think that's what makes it even funnier.  So check it out.

2049100,5,B0001ZX0EW,"God, it is hard to believe that there are 18 yr. old kids fighting in Iraq right now who weren't even BORN when Sledge Hammer! debuted in Sept. 1986.

  I remember watching the promos for this show as a 12 yr. old kid and being excited that another violent ""action"" show was on the way, to compliment the ""A-Team,"" etc. I didn't realize as a kid that Sledge was a satire, I just loved the shooting and comic violence of the charachter.

  Watching the show as an adult almost 20 yrs later, one cannot help but admire how ahead of its time ""Sledge Hammer!"" was. The opening credits have a fantastic, brassy ""James Bond/ Dragnet"" crime-fighter ring to them, and it's mega-cool when Sledge twirls the .44 and fires at the TV Screen. The show made fun of not just the sitcom format, but TV culture as a whole.

  In the ""cliffhanger"" episode, Trunk and Sledge raid a TV studio where a terrosist is broadcasting a televised ransom demand. Trunk bursts on to the set w/ Sledge at his side and says: ""Your show's just been cancelled, and Sledge turns to Trunk and asks ""You talkin' to me?"" This scene sums up the wonderful irreverance of Sledge Hammer! Anyone under 20 today grew up w/ fairly ""risque"" 1990s shows like NYPD Blue, Seinfeld, Freinds, Sex and the City, Sopranos, and other programs that use foul language, causal sexual references, and graphic, extreme violence. The 80s were very buttoned down, and most ""family hour"" shows were pathetic sitcoms stocked with souless TV familys who moralized about the dangers of cigarettes, drunk driving, suicide, and most of all, drug use. In ""Silver Spoons"" for example, a circa 1986 episode in that Norman Lear dreck-fest has little Ricky Shroder go deer hunting with his grandpa, and ""chicken out"" and cry when the time comes to pull the trigger. This typical 1980s liberal crap, where male characters are emasculated wimps like the dad in Family Ties, Silver Spoons, Differnt' Strokes, etc, made Slege a welcome relief. Sledge pulls the trigger ALL the time, and revels in needless violence. He grabs suspects by the collar and shakes them, makes arsonists walk across hot coals, and gets a suicidal man on a ledge back in the window by shooting at him with a .44 Magnum!

  Like a gust of fresh air, Sledge annihilated the competition with his violence, mayhem, and nihilsm. The pilot episode ""Unde the Gun"" hols up very well in America 2004. The target range in his apartment, the ""I Love Violence"" bumper sticker, shooting the soda machine, etc. - this was like NOTHING ever seen on network TV in the 80s.",1100476800,7,2556,4.680803571428571

I can't say much more than the other reviewers are saying.  The show is simply hands-down hilarious.  And, how gorgeous is David Rasche?  Even when he's acting stupid??  (Same goes for Anne-Marie Martin.)  Anchor Bay did a fantastic job with this release.  The look, the sound, the packaging are all top-notch.

2049103,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Anchor Bay, one of my favorite DVD releasing companies, has created the gold standard for all TV series on DVD! And what better series than SLEDGE HAMMER! to get this treatment! One of the funniest series of the 1980s, this show is about a San Francisco cop named Sledge Hammer (David Rasche) who LOVES violence and talks to his gun. Sledge's antics (e.g. blowing up a building with a bazooka to take out a rooftop sniper, making a thug beat himself up, etc.) are an endless source of frustration for his boss, Captain Trunk (Harrison Page). Only his partner, the smart and patient Dori Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin), seems to understand, if not tolerate, Hammer and his bizarre, as opposed to brutal, methods of fighting crime.

I grew up on the reruns of this series and it is just as funny as when I first saw this series! One of my favorite episodes is when Sledge, in an attempt to hide from hitmen sent by a Mob boss who wants him dead, ends up with an Amish farmer and his daughter (""Witless""); the ending is priceless! Another favorite episode is when he investigates the murders of Elvis impersonators (""All Shook Up"").

There are many great things about this DVD set! First, as creator Alan Spencer tells us at the beginning of Disc 1, the laugh tracks that were imposed by ABC because test audiences were too stupid to notice the humor of the series have been removed from the first six episodes! Second, the picture quality of these episodes look better than before! Third, there is a retrospective documentary where Spencer, Rasche, Page, and Martin look back on the series. And finally, there's the original pilot and a ton of promotional material (TV ads, electronic press kit, photo gallery, and bumper).

I think that any company who is releasing a television series to DVD should look to SLEDGE HAMMER!-SEASON ONE for guidelines on how to package the series. I'm looking forward to SEASON TWO, which is coming out next summer. Required viewing for '80s nostalgists and comedy fans!

This blissfully funny series about the trigger-happy cop Sledge Hammer is wonderful.  Hammer is a completely crazy but somehow strangely endearing character, with his not entirely accurate catch-phrase ""Trust me, I know what I'm doing""  He creates total chaos wherever he goes, but somehow manages to come out ahead at the end of every episode.

The show is packed with wonderful lines, one of my favourite is when they are looking for a crook and Sledge's partner says he frequents a massage parlour: ""But there's over a thousand of them in this city"" Sledge exclaims. ""No, he really goes there for a massage"" she says. ""Oh well, there's only about three of those"" he replies.

The supporting characters, Sledge's long-suffering partner (Anne-Marie Martin), and his irascible boss (Harrison Page, always on the verge of a Sledge-induced nervous breakdown)are excellent, but David Rasche as Sledge is the undisputed star.",1097625600,4,1084,4.961325966850829

The combination of clever writing, great acting, and a truly creative concept brought together a show with flawless execution.

Season One is hands-down one of the greatest DVD gifts you could give to yourself, your friends, your enemies, your pets, or your pool boy to enjoy, as long as they are fans of offbeat, anti-formulaic sitcoms with a crazy, edgy premise.  In this case, the premise is a Dirty-Harry parody about the ultimate fascist, right-wing police inspector Sledge Hammer, who with his put-upon, gorgeous partner, Detective Dori Doreau, fight crime in a metropolis teeming with seedy criminals and wackos and liberals!

Now, for those of you still reading, ""Sledge Hammer!"" hit the airwaves in 1986, and found a small but loyal audience over the years that tuned in each week to see Hammer deal with cultists, crazed Elvis impersonators, kidnappers, the Amish community, robots, evil game show hosts, bikini-clad terrorists, wicked toymakers, naughty nurses, and more in only the special, wacked-out way that he can.  Fans of the ""Naked Gun"" movies, ""Airplane"", and the Mel Brooks movies, will love this show; fans of shows like ""Webster"", ""Full House"", ""Seventh Heaven"" and such will want to kick their TV sets in.

The DVD set is filled with wonderful interviews with the principal actors:  David Rasche, Harrison Page, and Anne Marie Martin, along with the show's creator, Alan Spencer, who has quite possibly the funniest DVD commentaries I have ever heard on 4 of the episodes.  Kudos to Anchor Bay for spending a few bucks to line up all of these talented folks to talk about the show, and to put together a wonderful package of extras that also features series commercials, the un-aired pilot, deleted scenes, a cool booklet about the show's history, and more!

Quite possibly the highest praise I can give the show is that my 75-year-old grandmother, back in 1986, happened to be in the living room as I watched one of the Sledge episodes.  Normally her favorite viewing material consisted of ""Lawrence Welk"", ""Carol Burnett"", ""Hee Haw"" and ""Rhoda"".  Imagine my surprise while watching a Sledge episode on Saturday night when I overheard chuckling coming from behind me.  I turned around and she was laughing at one of Sledge's demented lines.  I knew then that this show was truly special.  She watched more episodes from that point on, and it truly put a smile on her face, along with the rest of my household at the time.

This is a set that people from 8 to 80 will love and want to revisit time and again, and share with those who have yet to be ""Hammer""-ed.  Enjoy...",1095120000,4,2497,4.844705882352941

I raced out and purchased a multi-region DVD player so I could watch Sledge Hammer!, my all time TV favourite show. The show was not aired in the UK until February 1989, and we didn't have to listen to the laughter track like our American cousins. Each episode is 25 minutes long, but seems like an hour long as there is so much action, laughs & even some moving scenes. Each episode is like a rollercoaster ride, and like a rollercoaster ride you are always left wanting more.

It's the story of Sledge Hammer! (David Rasche)and his fight for law & order, to rid the streets of crime. But this cop is unique he makes sure the criminals suffer! His partner Dori Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin)and his boss Capt. Trunk (Harrison Page) are also made to suffer as Sledge is on a crusade to get rid of crime, from blowing up a building to causing a nuclear explosion Sledge shows he is one tough cop. And of course every hero has a love interest and Sledge is no different, except he doesn't sleep with a woman, he sleeps with his gun and talks to it too!

Sledge Hammer! is a brilliant and funny show featuring spoofs of Elvis, Dirty Harry, Max Headroom and RoboCop to name but a few.

This DVD set features all the 22 episodes from season one, along with the unedited pilot episode. There are TV spots, interviews with the shows creator Alan Spencer, the shows stars David Rasche, Anne-Marie Martin & Harrison Page, commentaries from Alan Spencer and more.

This is the best TV show ever made and it is a must for all fans of TV cop shows.

Sledge Hammer! is a unique show and there has never been one that has made me laugh as much as this. I can't wait until season 2 is released as well as a UK release for this show that was such a huge hit in England.",1094601600,2,2056,4.221374045801527
2049150,5,B0001ZX0EW,"When ""Sledgehammer!"" came out in 1986, I was 14 years old and a big fan.  I'm 32 now, and what I thought was funny then is now hysterical due to the now-unpolitical-correctness of the show.  Judging it from today's cultural standards in the post-Rodney King era, the show becomes a side-splitting romp.  Oddly enough, after watching all the episodes, I found out that many of the expressions I use to this very day were lifted from the show.  ""Enough Warmth,"" and ""trust me, i know what I'm doing"" come to mind, but there are many others.  The show is cleverly written, though clearly hamstrung by the network television censors.  The removal of the laugh-track is a nice touch, and I appreciate the effort made to do it.  All in all, watching the old shows brought me from laughs to a morose sense of nostalgia.  I hadn't realize just how much I missed Sledge, Dori and Trunk.  Those characters really have stuck with me in a way I wasn't prepared for; and it leaves me yearning for more ""Sledgehammer!"" to the point of wanting to do my own fan-fic novel.  Who knows what the future may bring?  As for me, I can always hope for more.",1094515200,2,1134,4.482926829268293
2049151,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Watching Sledge Hammer again brought back a lot of fun memories when my father and I used to watch it back in the mid 80s (Note, I was only 4years old at the time). And also supplied an answer to the common question I'm asked ""Whered did you learn to talk?""

Anyway, let's get serious...

All of the 22 episodes on this set look and sound great on HD, Computers and Normal Television (Yes I haved watched it on all three forms of viewing).

The Extras on Disc Four are very entertaining, although everytime they showed a scene of SH with a laugh track it was mildly disturbing. (I Personally believe the Laugh Track is an demonic instrument)

The Commentaries on 4 of the episodes supplied an unique insight from the mind of creater Alan Spencer and one of the commentaries itself supplies an true Sledge like moment. (I won't say which one, you'll have to go and see)

All in all, Sledge Hammer - Season One is simply awesome, and it makes me wonder. When is Season 2 comming out?",1094515200,2,981,4.397790055248619
2049152,5,B0001ZX0EW,"I loved and understood the jokes then as I do now for ""Sledge Hammer"". As soon as I heard the first season was on DVD, I made sure that I got a copy. Watching it again, I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND... The casting was fabulous and David Rasche is unbelievable!!!

I was and still am a BIG admirer of the show and was thrilled that Alan Spencer persevered, at that time, to get it made. The world would be a duller place if it hadn't been produced. It's great therapy to watch the shows now since we now have to contend with the quagmire of extreme political correctness. It seems everyone is making the effort to look for the subliminal message in the ice cube when they should be exerting their energies, productively, elsewhere. It takes no effort to have a knee-jerk reaction to every little thing.

Another bonus on the DVD package is Alan Spencer's commentary. I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND... It is very informative and very funny!!

I really hope a ""Sledge Hammer"" film is made with the original cast (""pronto!"") and I hope political correctness is kept to a minimum (lighten up, people!).

I am looking forward to the second season of ""Sledgehammer"" on DVD.

Sledge is a man of action, and in todays world- we NEED men of action. Dori is a Woman of action- just as needed today.

2049154,5,B0001ZX0EW,"I was around 6 years old when I first saw ""Sledge Hammer!"" on TV. I don't really know why my parents let me watch it...or perhaps they didn't know I was watching it. Anyway, my only real recollection of the show was David Rasche, the theme song and the catch phrase.

Well, a couple of weeks ago I noticed that ""Sledge Hammer!"" was on DVD. Took a chance on vague childhood memories and I am glad that I did. I have been watching the DVDs pretty much every day since I bought it and I think it might be one of the greatest shows I have ever seen. I can't imagine as a kid understanding any of the jokes (besides maybe the ones involving explosions).

I brought the DVDs to a party my friend was throwing and it was a hit! More and more people kept coming in the room to see what was causing all the laughter. One friend of mine even fell off his chair laughing when Sledge handed a lady a grenade as protection against her abusive husband (he may have been drunk, but for the sake of this review, we'll give credit to the show and not the beverages). Long story less long: since the party, three of my friends have picked up the set.

If you enjoy off-the-wall humor and (of course) explosions, I can't recommend this DVD set enough. Now if only we could get someone to put together a ""Sledge Hammer!"" movie...",1094515200,3,1309,4.248995983935743
2049155,5,B0001ZX0EW,"This was a great package.  I was excited to see it come out and can't quit watching it.  The humor is ""killer""...references to 80's politics from Mondale to the Ruskies will have you rolling.

It's an excellent production as well.  My new favorite.",1094515200,2,248,4.6976744186046515
2049156,5,B0001ZX0EW,"This was the most refined parody of the ultra-conservative cop show genre from the late 60's through the mid-80's, most readily identifiable in Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" character - but that was serious drama!  ""Sledge Hammer"" made fun of everything from pop culture icons to current movies and other TV series, and - most importantly - himself.  The necessary sidekicks were a straight-laced ""broad"" who held her own in every show, and the obligatory frustrated 'Captain Dobey' (black) boss.  Fortunately the DVD release ditches the network-imposed laugh track, and since the viewer can now see this in context from almost 20 years of cultural advancement (Michael Jackson to, well (he's still around), now Britney Spears), this show actually brings forth a nostalgia for those simpler, Reagan-80's times.  Petition for Season 2 (and a new movie) to be released!!!",1094515200,3,870,5.282608695652174

It hasn't aged quite as well as I remember it as some of the episodes are a little flat... but my biggest complaint is that EACH episode is not segmented.

Therefore, when you get to the episode, you can't bypass the opening credits unless you fast forward it!  If you click the "">>"" on your DVD player, you'll go to the NEXT episode!  No beginning, middle, or end?

I had to deduct a point for that.",1094342400,,524,4.242424242424242

The visual quality of the DVD is pretty good (Dori is so very hot!), and the sound... well, it's good enough. I bought this DVD set for the over-the-top humor, not for surround sound effects. There is also a little 'file folder' with some show trivia in the DVD sleeve. Hopefully they'll make season two available as well.",1094169600,2,584,4.679611650485437
2049170,4,B0001ZX0EW,"I watched every Sledge Hammer episode in 1986-7.  A hilarious series, with many episodes spoofing famous movies of the time.  Sledge was a cop, loosely based on Dirty Harry. His partner, Dori, would try to keep his 44 Magnum (which he liked to talk to) in his holster, but rarely with much success.  The pilot episode, on this DVD, is excellent.  The rest of the season is very good.  I hope they issue another DVD set with season two!",1093564800,2,435,4.455696202531645

2049172,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Imagine taking the concept of Dirty Harry a little past insanity, and you get Sledge Hammer- a cop who enjoys violence as much as administering justice.  Combine that with a great supporting cast and excellent writing and you have one of the funniest shows ever.

An example of the humor- Sledge gets criticized by his boss ""You couldn't resist blowing up a building on the way to work!"" after he deals with a sniper on a rooftop by pulling out a bazooka from his trunk and demolishing the building (yes, he made sure it had been evacuated first).",1093046400,2,547,4.571428571428571

2049174,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Whenever someone says, ""Trust me, I know what I'm doing"" with a big gun in his hand, you know you should be worried. Either all hell is going to break loose or slapstick of the Three Stooges variety is on the way. You should be worried in either case. ""Sledge Hammer"" took the Dirty Harry character, made him inept and planted him right in the middle of a comedy. Sledge (David Rasche) talks to his gun. He does just about everything with his gun. His partner Dori (Anne-Marie Martin) displays a little more common sense. Unfortunately, Sledge rarely listens to what she or his boss Captain Trunk (Harrison Page) have to say and the result is bedlam.

A highlight of this series is ""Miss of the Spider Woman"" (if you love bad puns, you'll love this show for examle one episode is entitled ""Dori Day Afternoon"") where Sledge is mistaken for his neighbor. Unfortunately, his neighbor had a hit man after him. When the assassin poisons Sledge his reaction brought a smile to my face. ""Great, when I finally die, I'm gonna see my neighbor's life flash before my eyes!"" Gotta love a series that takes bad puns, slapstick and witty asides and crams them all into a twenty-two minute episode.

Anchor Bay does its usual stellar job here with a top-notch transfer. The images come at you just as fast and furious as the gags and there's few analog or digital blemishes. It helps that this series was shot on film vs. videotape as the overall quality is higher. The sound comes across with considerable presence. The DVD is packing heat with a lot of extras shoved into its shoulder holster. First-hurray! There's no laugh track on any of these. There's a very good 30 minute documentary included with the primary cast of Rasche, Martin and Page as well as key members of the crew. There's shared stories from the cast & crew about the trials they faced bringing the series to life. Also, the uncertainty they faced year to year as to whether they were going to be renewed, etc. We also get the promo spots, the ""bumper"" spots (i.e. ""We'll be right back""). There's also a ""case file"" booklet with trivia, comments, etc. We also get a stills gallery, memorabilia gallery and ""electronic"" press kit where producer/writer Spenser discusses the show for sponsors and network affiliates. The icing onthe cake, though, are the 4 episode commentary tracks by writer/creator/producer Alan Spenser. A pity none of the actors were invited to participate.

A amusing show that many fans will be happy to finally have on DVD, ""Sledge Hammer"" looks very good on DVD with a sharp transfer and comes with a variety of strong extras. For folks who hate laugh tracks, the removal of the laugh track is a big plus. Additionally, stuffed in Sledge's holster are a documentary, promo spots, the electronic press kit, a 16 page booklet with info and trivia and commentary on 4 tracks by the creator of the show. Oh, and I forgot to mention this--it has the unaired pilot episode as an added bonus as well. Enjoy!",1092182400,47,2982,4.6761904761904765

The minute it appears on TV (back in the 80's) I become an instant fan. Never had the chance to record it, though, so all I have left of the show was good memories. But now that its back on DVD, I'm happy again!

And what a cool way of bring back the Hammer! This is the kind of treatment every great-TV-show-on-DVD deserves. Flawless presentation, interesting booklet (an Internal Affairs file? ha) and plenty of cool extras to dig between episodes.

Nevertheless, I have the feeling that something its missing. Maybe its the fact that there's no captions, no chapters inside every episode and no real remastered audio and video (hey, but that's me). Still a really good collection, worth of 5 stars.

2049202,5,B0001ZX0EW,"I have read the existing reviews of Sledgehammer (28 to date) and feel that I have nothing to add regarding the comedy value of the series. I can only tell you that Sledgehammer is one of the funniest programs I have ever watched. The new DVD set will sit well alongside Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Ripping Yarns, Father Ted and BlackAdder on my ""most prized DVD"" shelf. It is generally a work of comic genius. Of course it appeals to many English people like myself because we appreciate irony so much.

What I would like to do in my review is to get inside the character of Sledge himself, maybe revealing something about the creator and writers.

Sledgehammer's complex character has always intrigued me. The Californian golden boy who forsook sun, chicks and surfing for target practice in a darkened shooting range.

He would rather grease his gun than wax his board, spend 10 bucks on ammo than on a girlie magazine.

Could Sledge have had any gun OTHER than a Magnum?

Fast forward to 2004 and Sledge would surely be driving a Hummer.

A parody of a parody? Sledgehammer takes a swipe at Dirty Harry which ITSELF was a parody of over-zealous law enforcement and a confirmation that the crazies are not only on the wrong side of the law.

The re-appearance of Sledge is welcome in 2004 on two counts. Firstly because of the current dearth of good comedy. It is also worthy of appreciation because Sledge is even more relevant today than he was when he first hit the streets (and anyone who got in his way). The series is a better reflection of contemporary values today than it was 15 years ago.

Sledge is Pax Americana personified. Why do you need courts? Who cares what the liberal do-gooders think?

Sledge has universal appeal. One group will revel in the Judge Dredd style law enforcement whilst the others will enjoy the irony of it all.

Sledge for President? Why not? In a world where reality and fantasy are increasingly hard to distinguish, we have a Terminator as Governor of California. This guy was elected based almost entirely on his Screen Persona. Am I wrong? Sledgehammer has an electable face and a ready made message for the voters - ""Trust me, I know what I'm doing!."" Skull and Bones? Instead of denying any association as both presidential candidates do, Sledge would have the logo flying from the flagpole over the Whitehouse. The same people who will in November vote for dubbyas ""kill em all and let God sort them out"" would surely approve of Sledgehammer. Just make sure that the Election Day is not in the hunting season or you will lose a lot of Michigun voters.

Of course the good guy always wins so even if you disagree with the methods used and the amount of collateral damage, it could be argued that message is sound.

How uncanny that the shows story lines of the 80?s and 90?s are still prevalent to today?s political farces.  I am delighted to spend my twilight hours watching episode after episode of David Rasche?s social goofs.

2049205,2,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer! was a show I wanted to like when it debuted but never did.

 The idea of doing a ""Get Smart""-like spoof of the 1980s actions stars such as Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone, and Bruce Willis was interesting, but to me this show didn't have a good follow through.

 David Rasche was a good choice to play the lead, but Anne-Marie Martin, as the ""99""-like female partner, to me, was kind of bland and Harrison Page, a good actor who played their supervisor, is saddled with a character whose constant anger gets annoying.

 The show did have some inspired moments. The idea of the last episode of this set is very funny only if you realize the producers thought the show had no chance of being picked up for a 2nd season, then watch the 1st show of that season.

 Otherwise, the running gags involving Sledge's relationship with his gun and his ""make-my-day""-like catchphrase get stale halfway through the season. The episodes that are spoofs are excellent ideas done too obviously, which, to me, perfectly sums up this series--a few good ideas not executed very well.",1090281600,2,1082,4.748663101604278

The almost slapstick humor is great for the kids while the very familiar underlying satire keeps adults in stitches.  We all know that Hammer is a Narcissist, but in a sense that is what makes the character so likable.  In a day when people are afraid to speak their mind if what they have to say is at all controversial, Hammer is never short for words, and certainly not short on action.  We like him because while he is often wrong, we wish we had his courage to speak our minds with no concern for the critic's opinions.  A friend of mine taped nearly 30 episodes and has viewed them repeatedly over the years.  Now we both have ""Season One"" on order, and our kids (all born post-Hammer) are just as excited as we are to be getting them this August.

David Rasche plays a Dirty Harry with his dead pan tongue firmly planted in his cheek.  With Dori Doreau, Capt. Trunk, Norman Bates and Office Majoy, Sledge tries to clean up the street of various scum with his beloved pistol.
With Bill Bixby, Jackie Cooper, Robbie Seymour as director, the show is one gem!  Glad to see they blew the dust off.  Just don't take so long for season #2!!

2049222,5,B0001ZX0EW,Hey all.  It's clasic tv at it's best!  This was one of my favorite tv shows of the 1980's.  You can go to the sledgehammeronline website to see more details.  I am so glad this series is brought back to life in dvd.,1086998400,12,216,3.953488372093023
2049223,5,B0001ZX0EW,"It's been a long wait, but I am absolutely thrilled that 'Sledge' is now finally coming to DVD. In the late 80s and early 90s, Scottish Television used to show Sledge Hammer! during the 'wee small hours', but I still used to stay up and watch it religiously, with the result that I currently have every episode (minus commercials!) on VHS.
The show itself was very funny. Sledge had to be the most non-politically-correct cop in TV history! Doreau provided the reason to counter Hammer's madness (and not a small amount of glamour!) and Captain Trunk's deafening clashes with Sledge were always hilarious.
In short, a hidden classic which deserves to sell by the thousands and find a whole new generation of fans. Congratulations to creator Alan Spencer and roll on season two!",1086480000,6,777,4.849624060150376
2049224,4,B0001ZX0EW,"OK, I ordered this bad boy recently because I have fond memories of this series as a kid. Sometimes people say something is ""brutally funny"" and they are just kidding, Well, this was funny and brutal at the same time. Almost like watching the Cubs or the Red Sox trying to get to the World Series. Well, I digress. Anyway, this was a parody of the ultra-hard core cop shows of the 1970s and 1980s at heart, but managed to parody other genres, from film noir to suspense and other areas as well.
The two things that stand out about this show for me, besides the talented people who made it happen, are the multilayered approach to humor, where there was almost always a subtle backcurrent of almost British humor under the more over-the-top sight gags and Three Stooges style combat action; and the way they could CONSISTENTLY, and I mean almost every time, nail an entire genre or two hour movie in parody form and do it in thirty minutes (with a couple commercial breaks as well.) If you are a fan of 1970s disaster movies that laughed themselves silly watching ""Airplane"" or a western fan who dug ""Blazing Saddles,"" this is probably going to be your cup of tea. The parodies they did in this one were done with love - well at least you could tell they loved what they were doing with the material. A unique and funny show. Expect standout performances from David Rasche (As gung-ho Inspector Sledge Hammer - Imagine Dirty Harry mixed in with Larry, Moe and Curly) Anne-Marie Martin (As Detective Dori Doreau, the partner saddled with keeping Sledge from causing too much chaos) Harrison Page (As the Police Captain trying to run a precinct with a crime wave and Hammer playing from both directions) and a stainless-steel-finish custom gripped Smith and Wesson .44 Magnum (As the show's love interest. Really.) Good stuff, good stuff.",1085529600,11,1835,4.684210526315789

2049226,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer is one of the most incredile TV series ever. It consistenly made fun of while paying homage to something new in every episode. If you remember the series from TV  you will want the DVD, if you missed it on TV you will want the DVD to see a TV classic. If you lived in the United States in the 1980's, you will enjoy this TV series. This was a counter culture show, the critics hated it, those of us fortunate enough to find it on the dial back then loved, as will you.",1084579200,6,482,4.020833333333333
2049227,5,B0001ZX0EW,"While creator Alan Spencer's offbeat sitcom ""Sledge Hammer!"" clearly was a takeoff of Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" character, the series itself was more of a hybrid of NBC's ""Hunter"" (which also featured a man & woman cop team) and ABC's ""Police Squad!"" (which also featured hilarious deadpan one-liners). Both ""Hammer"" & ""Squad"" even shared writers and directors as well as ""!"" in the title.

The first season opens with Inspector Sledge Hammer (David Rasche) ordered by superior Captain Trunk (Harrison Page) to partner with Sergeant Dori Doreau (Anne Marie Martin) where they investigate the kidnapping of the mayor's daughter. Later, the season closes with a bang--literally--as Hammer sets off a nuclear bomb; the producers had not expected the series to be renewed. However, when the green light was given for a second season, Hammer showed up alive and well.

While most ""Sledge Hammer!"" diehards know what to expect from this oddball cult-show, the appeal may be lost on first-time viewers. But if given the chance the show is sure to please simply for its goofy dead-on satire and sharp, laugh-out-loud dialogue. Big ups to Alan Spencer, who joins the ranks of producers Paul Simms (""NewsRadio"") and Jason Katims (""Roswell"") for striving to release this fan-favorite program as a quality DVD set. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a trend.

I was like 15 when this was on TV and was by far my favorite show and was so bummed it didn't last long.  I have a couple episodes on videotape, but this is a blessing from above.  With all the crap shows coming out onto DVD sets, it is about time a TRUE CLASSIC series is brought back for us early thirty-somethings to enjoy and show these kids today what a great show has been hiding away all this time.",1084320000,5,576,4.008771929824562

Every word he says, every gesture he does, is always so over the edge it's absolutely hilarious. I remember a scene in a mortuary, where the coroner said ""I've never seen this in my 12 years as a coroner..."" Doreau says ""I've never seen anything like this in my 12 years as a cop..."" And Sledge finally ""I've never seen anything like this in my 49 years as a man""... ""But Sledge, you're only 40!"" ""I WAS A MAN 9 YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN DOREAU!""

2049250,5,B0001ZX0EW,"The Year was 1986 and i was about 12 years old. Every week my father and i would watch this new show called SLEDGE HAMMER! Starring David Rache as inspector Sledge Hammer. It was the funniest show on TV and it still holds this title today! It was way ahead of it's time. It has the funniest one-liners i've ever heard!
It's so over the top ""politically incorrect"", that's what makes the show so great. It's all about violence and more violence. There is NO WAY this could be put on TV today. But thanks to Alan Spencer(series creator) Sledge will be hitting store shelves very soon. And for the price they're selling it for, there's no reason not to buy it. If enough people buy Season 1 maybe we'll see Season 2 DVD released. So don't burn it for you're friends, make them buy it!
TO: Alan Spencer
We(the fans) want to thank you for all the time and effort you poured into the Season 1 DVD set. Sledge on DVD is dream come true. And thanks for asking the fans what we wanted on the DVD's(and doing it!) That was very cool.

2049254,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Lives, and about time...
At last a true life depiction of American Law Enforcement!
A very clever and knowing parody of US cop shows and for my money superior (and different) to the Naked Gun series. Often shown late night in the UK it is a must in particular for viewers who have not seen a number of the season 1 Episodes due to scheduling issues.
Good stories, some fantastic one-liners and a plethora of sight gags make for quality and enduring entertainment. A memorable and sorely missed series. Welcome back Sledge!

TV's most entertaining fare of the 80's was (unfortunately) one of that decades best kept secrets as well, but with this release of SLEDGE HAMMER! - SEASON ONE on dvd, veteran Sledgie's will cheer and nascent Hammerheads will no doubt be spawned. A legion of loyal fans who never tired of our hero (as he made the streets safer - for some - in a post-Reagan yogurt-sucking, mutant commie wasteland) are reunited with the man and his 'Gun'.
Our magnum farce lineup includes David Rasche (Inspector Sledge Hammer!) who is quick with a quip and his deadly 44...Anne-Marie Martin (Detective Dori Doreau) who absolutely sizzles as the leggy foil in heels ...and Harrison Page (Captain Trunk) who has a sensibility that is equal parts white-collar soul and Sgt. Carter panache. Interviews with these cast members augment this 22 episode collection, which comes with complete and unedited episodes - not the typical hacked syndicated re-runs.
Yes, in these troubled times, it's good to know that SLEDGE HAMMER! will be back on the job, at least for a season.",1082505600,7,1323,4.963963963963964
2049256,5,B0001ZX0EW,"Sledge Hammer! was one of the wittiest sitcoms on network television and it's a pleasure to see that it's finally being released on DVD. Brilliantly written, the series put other cop comedies like Police Squad and Barney Miller to shame with its great dialogue and hysterical parodies. Its satirical touch was perfectly performed by David Rasche and the rest of the cast, who could all give a lesson in subtlety to today's sitcom actors. Sometimes it was slapstick, sometimes it was satire, and sometimes it was both, but all of the times Sledge was right on target with its humor. I can't wait to get the DVDs and I'm hoping that someday Sledge will make it to the silver screen just as the far less funny Police Squad did. It's Hammer Time!!!!",1082419200,4,745,4.651515151515151

The funniest cop on TV returns to rock our world, almost twenty years later. This will be a collection like none other, with new commentary by the major stars and by Alan Spencer himself. Spencer's superb wit and Rasche's spot-on characterization combined to make ""Sledge Hammer"" the funniest thing about the 80's (and if you remember the hair, that's saying quite a bit!)

My favourite episodes include: ""Desperately Seeking Dori"" (A blow to the head results in Dori Doreau adopting the ultra-violent personality and mannerisms of her partner, Sledge Hammer, while investigating a counterfeit ring); ""To Sledge, with Love"" (Sledge is assigned to bring order to a notoriously dangerous local high school that is dominated by four young toughs who supply stolen cars to a crime boss); ""All Shook Up"" (Sledge goes undercover to investigate the murders of Elvis impersonators with a gold microphone); ""The Old Man and the Sledge"" (Sledge tries to provide help and guidance to Gil Yates, a retired trigger-happy police officer whom he idolized as a boy and patterned his whole life after); ""To Live and Die on TV"" (Sledge becomes a contestant on ""The Million Dollar Question"" in an attempt to prove that the show's host (played by Peter Marshall) was responsible for the murder of a successful contestant). and ""Magnum Farce"" (a takeoff on ""Magnum Force"" as Sledge infiltrates a group of vigilante police officers who are executing recently acquitted criminals).",1492992000,,1350,5.2407407407407405

You have to listen to the things Sledge says because sometimes it's so quick you might miss the joke. Like on one episode you see a guy telling a cop about some guy that arrested him, but because he didn't have hand cuffs he was tied to the hood of the car and was called Bambi. Sledge walks by and the criminal says ""That's the guy!"" Dori asks Sledge who that guy is and Sledge says ""He's my favorite hood ornament.""
