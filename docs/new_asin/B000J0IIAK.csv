8415335,2,B000J0IIAK,"The dancing in this video was of a high standard but the film quality was very poor, which was so disappointing.  The colours were so washed out that all reds were pink and everything had a sepia tinge.  Also the film quality made everything look ghostly and insubstantial so it was virtually unwatchable.  If the quality of this video had been acceptable, what I could actually see of it would have been well worth watching.  I will not bother to watch it again as you strain your eyes trying to make things out.  A surprise at the end after the credits had rolled was what looked like a rehearsal for an Irish dance set, performed by the dancers in practice gear.  All in all, a very disappointing buy but at least it was so cheap I couldn't complain about the price.",1318464000,,769,4.418439716312057
