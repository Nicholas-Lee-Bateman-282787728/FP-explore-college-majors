 William Shatner* works his on-screen magic anew, this time as a wealthy businessman whose life is threatened. He throws a swanky party where only his murder suspects have been invited. Barbara Edens natural air of elegance is the perfect fit for the role of the investigative journalist who is there to help solve the crime.

With a cameo cast of renowned talent such as Roddy McDowell and Morgan Fairchild, this is a spellbinding who-done-it. Beautiful people, lavish sets and an unexpected plot twist will keep the viewer guessing.

5880688,4,B00DZUHNIE,"A group of people are gathered on Dead Man's Island. The owner's life is threatened. A storm is brewing.  This, to me, is an almost unfailing recipe for a good time.  There's nothing I like better than a classic mystery set on an island, train or boat.  Think And Then There Were None, Evil Under the Sun or Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie.  Of course, the quality is not up to that standard, or even the book by Carolyn Hart, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  But who cares?  The cast is a collection of veteran tv and movie actors, which was fun in itself (do you recognize the maid?), and I smiled through the whole thing.  If you enjoy old classic mysteries, and are willing to lower your expectations a bit and just enjoy this for what it is, give it a try.  I wish there were more movies like this to be had, can't get enough, so I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 3 so people who like this kind of thing like I do will notice it.",1389657600,5,935,4.12707182320442
5880689,2,B00DZUHNIE,"Terrible movie, but you simply cannot resist this 1980's cast!  William Shatner!  Barbara Eden!  Christopher Atkins!  Donny Most (yes, from Happy Days!)  Morgan Fairchild! Roddy McDowell!  The guy from Simon and Simon!  Come on, the eighties are calling.",1389484800,6,254,5.526315789473684
5880690,3,B00DZUHNIE,I found that this movie was hard to follow cause it jumped around  and you had to really stay focused on it. I feel this was not one of both Williams and Barb 's movies.,1386979200,,169,3.8285714285714287
5880691,5,B00DZUHNIE,"Barbara Eden starred in many great made-for-TV movies in the 1970's, 80's and 90's, and this 1996 mystery was her last starring role in a TV movie. Fortunately, it is also one of her best TV movies.

Barbara has the lead role in this movie- everyone else has a supporting part. Barbara stars as a woman who is asked by her old friend (William Shatner) to join him and some guests on his private island. (He has a mansion on the island.) After Barbara gets there, Shatner explains to her that an unknown person is trying to kill him, so he's gathered all of the suspects on the island, and he wants Barbara to figure out who the would-be killer is.

Barbara still looks stunningly beautiful in this fun mystery (incredibly she was 65 when she made this!) I highly recommend this movie- it is a terrific finale to Barbara's illustrious TV movie career!",1386115200,10,850,4.512987012987013
