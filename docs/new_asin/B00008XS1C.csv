1866406,4,B00008XS1C,"The companion book for this DVD is excellent, one of the best places I could recommend one to look if they were interested in a brief but detailed account of what Chomsky's political analysis is all about.  This DVD has much of that content, but there are numerous flaws.

The first flaw you will notice is the bizarre music which starts the film and recurs several times.  Secondly, the editing just seems to have been done rather hastily... beyond that there is a sequence in which some random people are seemingly forced into responding to what they thought of a talk, which is kind of off putting... and there is a strange montage (interlude?) of footage of people walking around NYC, which makes little sense.

Content-wise, there are some great lines of thought offered from Chomsky himself, though the editing job sometimes doesn't allow those threads to be developed, and the jumping from one thing to another can leave an uninitiated viewer probably a bit perplexed.

The footage of Chomsky dealing with a barrage of questions and autograph requests after talks is interesting to see and the interview sections taken from his office (or some classroom) are very insightful.

A lot of what ends up in the video seems a bit focused around some quicker summarial nuggets of wisdom that Chomsky most likely elaborated on further, but the editing again seems to cut much out.

I like this of course, and there is a lot here.  Still, this could have been done a lot better.  It seems very rushed.  And with DVDs being what they are, why not include full footage of some of the talks or interviews as extras, so that people could learn more?

It's good, but I would recommend Manufacturing Consent first, or the Distorted Morality dvd (which is one continuous talk, with bonus question and answer footage which is also insightful).  The Rebel Without a Pause dvd is quite similar to this one in some respects, though I find the content of Chomsky's talks included in Power and Terror to be a bit more useful.

All are good though of course and in spite of the above criticisms, I thank the filmmakers for the opportunity to view the portions of these talks which they have collected.

If you want more info though, read the book (and his other books as well, then follow his sources and recommendations!)",1123372800,7,2306,4.7182044887780545
1866407,5,B00008XS1C,"Through a series of interviews and lectures, this movie provides a coherent framework for interpreting historical and contemporary events related to use of power and fear of terror by states.  While the U.S. is used as a ""case study"", the analysis provided here remains sufficiently general and applicable to other powerful nations.  The DvD commences with the basic and unambigiously clear definition of terrorism as stated in the U.S. army manual and works its way up to vague interpretations employed by powerful governments and news-hungry media.  Chomsky's contribution in this DvD is to examine what happens if this unambigious definition of terrorism offered by the U.S. army manual was applied to the action of the U.S. government; or if the rationale used by the U.S. to justify a particular action were actually applied by less powerful nations.  The Chomsky framework for exploring this topic goes well beyond a single nation or government, or a particular time period in history.  Much of the ideas in this DvD have already been discussed in other Chomsky books; but this DvD weaves them well together.  Highly recommended.

Chomsky seems incredibly out of touch, especially considering many of his positions.  But even if you agree with him, this DVD isn't likely to enthral you either.  He tries to directly connect terrorism and the larger issue of power without actually dealing with each issue.  The viewer is left to ask ""What is terror to Chomsky?"" and ""Whose power, where?"" and ""What the heck is this guy getting at?""  He could clear things up and liven the DVD up and it still would seem bluntly ineffective.  I've never given a one-star review before, but I'd give this zero stars if it was an option.

But it is classic Chomsky, and sometimes it's just pleasant to hear someone being consistent and making sense when they talk. More than anything else, that's what Chomsky means to me.
He's a walking encyclopedia -- knows his stuff. He knows the definition of words he uses. He has a consistent and passionate sense of humanity. He's not a politician, not a liar, and not a hypocrite. And because of this, we love him. Because of this, the world would be a better place with more Chomsky in it.

1866414,5,B00008XS1C,"I viewed this MOVIE at the time, at its western
hemispheric debut, in Palo Alto, CA and was
disappointed in its craftsmanship as a movie and
a documentary.  It felt like almost a home movie
presentation of Chomsky lecturing.
I have to recommend ""Manufacturing Consent"" as a
superior effort, but as I say in the review title,
anything ""Chomsky"" gets a 100% in my book.  I would
see him in lecture, or any movie that was made about
him.
Noam Chomsky reads and digests books at the rate most
of us go through oxygen.  He wrote his first book when
he was a child, and developed a very egalitarian,
democratic uniquely American, and possibly as much
Anti-American (a term he says only has meaning in
extremely totalitarian societies, and has much fun
with as he toys with the idea of Anti-Italianism)
but Chomsky is a rugged idealist, individualist,
without the contempt for the average working folk
and the experience to know what he is talking about.
I am not a liberal or conservative, but I do like facts
and I like to listen to people who know them, understand
them and can enlighten me about their view of the facts.
Chomsky is one person who, whether or not you agree with
him, which I do on most things, but do not on some major
issues, will - if you are willing to listen with an open
mind give you the free benefit of his incredible moral and
encyclopaedic knowledge, and wisdom.  Having won as Nobel
prize in Linguistics qualifies him in my mind as well as
one who can abstract ideas and meaning at least as well
and as validly and any human on our planet and qualifies
him as one all of us in the world owe a listen to at least
once.
This man is a national treasure.  This is where Power and
Terror is meaningful to me, in just recording Chomsky's
words appearances this movie is important.  Where it fails
in my view is that it is too choppy, does not go into
Chomsky's philosphy deeply on any one issue, and does not
challenge Chomsky.  In this way it reminded me of a first
effort in cinemetography of hero worship.
If one really wants to see the brilliance and multi-
dimensionality of Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent is better
for that.  Power and Terror whets one's appetite for more
Chomsky, more truth, and raw discussion, which to me is
very important and very missing in our national debate.
Personally, I feel any media attention Chomsky can get
is good, so I urge people to see or buy anything that
features his point of view.  This man is mischaracterized,
villified, insulted and demeaned by the right-wing radio
host such as Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, etc, men who
name-call and attack the person.  If you are even honest
and right wing, and you think you believe what the right
says about Chomsky, then you at least owe it to yourself
to hear what he says and consider it before you pass
judgement.",1055462400,129,2824,4.5088062622309195
1866415,4,B00008XS1C,"Since September 11 2001 there has been a seemingly endless amount of discussion about what might have led to the events of that day. Naturally, veteran linguist, political commentator and activist Noam Chomsky has become a prominent figure in this discussion, which seems to have raised his profile significantly. This is heartening to me - I cannot think of one person more knowledgeable on the history of US foreign policy than Chomsky and, while only a small selection of this is demonstrated in this DVD, the movie - excerpts from 2002 talks cut with interviews - is certainly a useful introduction to his thinking on global politics. The filmmakers use a well-known New York Times Book Review quote in the introduction - that Chomsky is ""arguably the most important intellectual alive"" but that ""his political writings are maddeningly simple-minded"". This last point is close to the truth: Chomsky believes that all countries, especially superpowers, should apply the same standards to themselves as they apply to others. This may seem obvious but to many it seems incomprehensible, a point noted by Chomsky. It forms the basis of a lot of Chomsky's work and is very much in keeping with the man's humanism. And that humanism (and humanity) is one thing those new to Chomsky could not fail to notice: the man is not intellectually pompous, basely emotive or beat-you-about-the-head moralistic. Rather, he comes across as an ordinary guy (ok, a very intelligent and immaculately-researched ordinary guy) speaking his mind and listening to others speak theirs. If you are very familiar with Chomsky's work you won't find much new information here - it's more like a collection of his thinking relevant to 9/11, with a few observations made since. If you're not familiar with Chomsky and are interested in expanding your horizons, this is a great way to start - be prepared for some eye-opening facts.",1051488000,88,1903,5.063694267515924

7987756,2,B00008XS1C,"There are a bunch of falsehoods, misrepresentations and downright BS in this film. Here are just a few:

Claimed that the bombing of Truiljo (although that's not the official name of the event he is mentioning) killed 3000 people, actual numbers from the UN to America's Watch put the actual number around 5-7 (Yes FIVE to SEVEN people). Ironically Chomsky calls this a terrorist activity completing ignoring that a brutal dictator that allowed drug lords to run the country was removed and the duly elected president (remember he was elected BEFORE the Invasion but Noriega seized control of the country) was installed and democracy was restored to the cheers of the majority of the country.. The US went in at the behest of democracy loving Panamanians who wanted free elections and their president to be in power and then left very quickly. Remember the majority of Panama was happy that the US helped them but Chomsky calls this a terrorist act similar to 9/11.

He misquote Bush changing the whole context of Bush's question than he was downright disingenuous about what the Wall Street Journal reported on and basically said what HE wanted them to say. He then went on and lied about what the Eisenhower report about the middle east said, again he claimed that it was what HE wanted it to say. He did get one thing right, both the WSJ and the Eisenhower report agreed with each other so nothing has changed over the 50 years. But let me be clear these reports did NOT say anything close to what Noam Chomsky claims they did. This was downright intellectual dishonesty on his part and at that point I truly lost respect for this man. NOTE: I will give him credit that he did acknowledge that there is a systemic hatred of America in the middle East, while he is 100% wrong about WHY he at least acknowledges this which is something most on the far left refuse to do.

When you believe in arrant falsehoods about what terrorists believe and why they hate us you obviously will draw arrantly false conclusions and Chomsky doesn't disappoint. According to him if we just stopped promoting democracy (he calls that terrorism) they would stop attacking us. It's that simple to him. There is no thought about differing worldviews, cultures that promote violence, the wholesale inculcation of youth, the idea that killing people is someone's holy right, etc. etc. All of these realities are simply swept under the rug and ignored.

In one of the most bizarre segments Noam can't figure out why Turkey would support the invasion of Iraq when for all intensive purposes they are a Muslim nation and should hate us too. His answer requires one to ignore everything we know about the middle east, Muslims and democracy. We have to ignore the reasons that the Turkish people tell us, we have to ignore Turkish History and we have to throw logic and reason out the window and just accept his wild conjecture with absolutely no proof to back it up. Who would be so credulous you ask, well just read the reviews, this man and his fantasies have numerous followers - astounding as that may be, none of them ask for any proof or question what he says. Chomsky's crowd look likes those that go to faith healing ceremonies, none of them question they only have faith that the healer is being truthful, this sort of anti-intellectualism is simply foreign to me. I digress, here is the bottom line behind Turkey, while still mostly Muslim they are NOT a theocracy, they are a western democracy with an open and free educational system. They don't have a large fundamentalist community, there is no Sharia law, women are not subjugated and the economy is prosperous. This conversion to a western democracy is a recent thing so the people remember and they understand that it was America that helped them out of the burden from some archaic monarchy and allowed people personal freedom in the lives. The Turks, having tasted and now living under a western democracy and seeing just how beneficial it is simply don't understand why those would want to stay under oppression and they were willing to help spread democracy. Well at least that what the Turkish people have told me and written about so you can believe them or you can take Noam's claim - Turkish people want to kill Kurds.

The next segment is just one of those WTF moments. Japan in a sneak attack on pearl harbor kills 3000 Americans and declares war against us, yet Noam is complaining that we never stood trial for our terrorist attacks (we fought back) we committed against the Japanese. That we were somehow the real aggressor and Japan was just a victim of our abuse.

Then when you really can't think it can get any worse Chomsky claims that the bombing of the Sui-ho hydroelectric compound in Korea was done to starve the people so they couldn't farm rice. This is blatantly false, the hydroelectric compound provided virtually all of the electricity for North Korea and it was a United Nations sanctioned attack because they thought it would help move the truce talks forward. The fact is the dam wasn't the target and even if it was destroyed there was no threat of civilians causalities downstream. So Noam lies about this and tries to link the bombing of the Holland dykes by Germany as a false equivalence. the difference there is that the goal was to exterminate the Dutch with a flood of water and to destroy their homeland. But Noam in his anti-American hatred can't seem to see the difference between the two.

Noam then goes on to misleads the viewer about the use of poison gas by Britain in 1919. First and foremost there is NO evidence that any was used, but that's beside the point what Noam doesn't mention is that the poison gas Churchill was referring to was ""tear gas"" He left out Churchill's pertinent quote about why he wanted to use tear gas his reasoning was:

""The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. . . gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.""

Once again Noam was less than honest to his viewers.

The next piece Noam Chomsky distorts again, Prince Abdullah warned America that if they continue to support the only Democratic state in the middle east again there could be some real uprising since the people there want them gone. (Democracy is considered evil to most Muslims and they see this as defiling god on their sacred lands) The Bush administration was clear that we will protect democracies around the world and that we have the ability to do that. According to Noam WE were bullying the Arab people and threatening them, but this sort of convoluted thinking is all throughout his works. Japan attacks us, we magically become the aggressor. Iraq attacks Kuwait, Iraq is a victim and on and on it goes.

Noam Chomsky claims that you couldn't protest the Vietnam war without being threatened or murdered in 1960-61, but by 1965 protests were growing. WTF, we didn't put ground troops into Vietnam UNTIL March 8, 1965, what war would he be protesting in 1960??????? BTW Joan Baez led 600 people to protest ""ENTERING"" Vietnam in 1964 and in January 1965 protests were held on 35 campuses throughout the country to protest us ENTERING the war.

The biggest problem with Chomsky is that he see things in a very skewed way. Japan attacks us and declares war so we fight back and in his mind the US is wrong and we should be charged with war crimes. We protect democracies and generally don't like to see dictators harming citizens so we have stepped in and returned the country to sovereignty but in Chomsky's mind we are the terrorist, it's far better to let the dictator murder and kill thousands and oppress the poor and the weak. In the middle east Chomsky is completely fine with Israel being destroyed because if that's what they Arabs in the region want who are we to stop them and if we or heaven forbid Israel protect themselves from the numerous terror acts that happen on a monthly basis he labels us or Israel as the aggressor.

When you see things like he does you never once examine what the ""other side"" has done. Their actions are always forgivable, their aggressions are actually responses to what America may have done 30 years ago 15,000 miles from them so their actions are legitimate. When he distorts the reasons why people might not like the US to fit his preconceived dogmas he is doing a bigger disservice to himself and his listeners than he can imagine since if he doesn't understand why's he will always promote a falsehoods built upon this false assumption.

One of the biggest contradictions that you find in Noam Chomsky is his refusal to apply the standards he wants to hold America and other western democracies to the people he applauds. Noam Chomsky talked about being a hypocrite and I was thinking the whole time why he can't possibly apply the same critical analysis to brutal dictators or suicide bombers who want to take out the most amount of civilian casualties because of some supposed holy words written several millennia ago. If Noam Chomsky was a public defender his defense of a rapist would be that the victim was wearing slutty clothes so she wanted to be raped.

When he was off script he said some very interesting things and to be honest he seemed more like a rambling slightly incoherent person who thought the world of himself. Anyhow here are just a few things that stood out.

1) The news media should be led by public opinion - he has no desire that they report the facts, rather they back up what the public feels is true or wants to hear. He used MSNBC as an example of a new outlet that is designed for its audience. The irony is he has slammed Fox as being nothing but a mouthpiece for the right, hmmmm isn't fox just designed for its audience - obviously the hypocrisy and double standard is glaring.
2) The government has ZERO influence on the media. This is just plain head in the sand stupidity on the part of Noam. But to prove his point he then complains that a minor sale of arms was not reported by the media ( 99% of them aren't) and infers that the government did NOT tell them not to cover it. How this proves his point was lost on me and it sure looked lost on the group people surrounding him.
3) He claims that capitalism doesn't exist, of course he didn't elaborate on what does exist but just him uttering those words made his devotees swoon. Unfortunately even Noam realizes he can't just make blanket statements that capitalism doesn't exist so be slowly backpedals and then claims what we have is well errrrrrr capitalism, BUT there has to be better systems.

Bottom Line:

Chomsky's views are pretty simplistic. He thinks that the dominant nation of the world and it's hegemony are evil because they have the absolute power. This power always corrupts and they can not be held accountable so all of their actions are evil. Therefore any military might they show, even if it's 100% defensive is turned in Chomsky's mind as an act of a all powerful aggressor and is prima facie terrorism. Acts done by lesser states that are not part of the hegemony, no matter how brutal can always be excused or even better be projected back onto the evil over lording empire because the lesser state is acting only in response to some other terrorist activity.

I know Chomsky is upheld by many on the left as some sort of demi-god intellectual but I find most of his ramblings to be ultra black and white / good vs evil fairy tales. Chomsky doesn't allow for context, nuances or shades of gray that exist everywhere. I need a little bit more intellectual thinking about subjects and a whole lot less of weakly argued foundational assumptions that dictate how I view everything.

Two stars because it's useful to show just how inane and misleading his ramblings are.

7987758,5,B00008XS1C,"I think the title is the best way to explain this DVD. I think reviewers have some justification in saying that as a film it is disjointed. The film is almost like a reality TV show, with the camera crew following him around on various assignments. He speaks a little on a multitude of topics, but the DVD does not really focus on any one particular point.

Of more use, in fact, are the extras on the DVD which consist of 15 minute exerpts of Chomsky speaking on single issues, such as terrorism, globalisation etc.

If you have seen/read 99% of Chomsky's stuff then I would advise you to avoid this stuff. If like me you have only been introduced to Chomksy recently (and I am most grateful for this) then consider purchasing this DVD. If you have never heard of Chomksy, you should get this DVD. Chomsky is a man of great intelligence and integrity. He is able to cut through the falsehoods of much of todays standard discourse ('terror', Israel Palestine etc) with clarity and truth.",1210291200,2,987,4.53932584269663
7987759,1,B00008XS1C,"Substantive opinions about Noam Chomsky aside, let me first say that this was an incredibly low quality documentary with very little in the way of production value. There are several black frames interspersed throughout the film for no apparent reason and the Japanese songs that make up its soundtrack are just plain weird. There's also no central narration and what it amounts to is just a sequence of clips with Mr. Chomsky speaking in his ultra-confident, detached, and low intensity voice. No unifying theme is presented and the topics stray from WWII to Nicaragua to Turkey to Israel to Britain to 9/11, but, of course, even if it is not directly stated his viewpoint can be summarized as full-time anti-Americanism. Basically, in Chomsky's mind, we're the real terrorists so we don't have the right to respond once we're attacked. That's a pretty accurate summary of this icon's opinions. Chomsky made important contributions to linguistics many years ago but has said little of substance since. He thinks he is being very clever when he says that you can't have a War on Terror, but of course you can as we can hunt down members of groups who have declared war against us and/or take responsibility for terrorist acts. Bono thinks that he's a rebel without a pause, but Chomsky's a faux rebel. There's no danger in being a citizen in American and hating your own country. Chomsky's been doing it for 40 years and nothing's ever happened to him and nothing ever will.",1183161600,2,1474,4.853174603174603
7987760,5,B00008XS1C,"Chomsky speaks when others are silent. He take on double standards seen throughout the established political spectrum. Discusses how it is inconsistent and hypocritical to support the American invasion in Afghanistan, while at the same time adhering to humanistic principles. Even though this was an invasion accepted by liberals, the US media and scholarship do not use the same standards when analyzing attrocities by (read: other) rouge regimes.",1128038400,6,448,5.602941176470588
