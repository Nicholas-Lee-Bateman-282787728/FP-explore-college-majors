4513534,5,B00508VTIE,"In the last two weeks I have, after getting a new home SPIN bike, tried a series of virtual DVDs.

This one is, hands down THE WINNER!  I have not had so much fun nor worked so hard on the bike as with this one.

I have already bought N California and Italy from the same series.

The ride is magnificent, smooth, thrilling. The cadence and work data are unobtrusive.  The narrator is very encouraging and driving.  You do have an option of no narration, but so far I love the encouragement and push.

WOW what beautiful Arizona and Utah scenery.  It is both on and off road, up and down hills and around steep curves.  The last drive up the hill is brutal.

I cannot recommend this strongly enough. Can I give more than 5 stars?  Can't wait to do the ride again, and again.",1360108800,,774,4.232876712328767
4513535,2,B00508VTIE,The scenery is beautiful but the film maker forgets this is a run video. This is my second Virtual Run Video and i was surprised by the speed of the camera. Almost as if it is being filmed by someone on a bike or in a car. Also the scenery is from above so it appears like you are flying amongst the trees not running on the ground. Too many trails that stop suddenly and starts a new trail. Camera Gazes at the scenery for prolonged periods remember this is a running video. I would like to return but not worth the trouble,1358985600,8,524,4.097087378640777
4513536,5,B00508VTIE,"I have always loved the scenery of the Southwest, and this is truly gorgeous. I like that you can choose natural sounds and it sounds like the wind is blowing.",1354665600,,159,4.333333333333333
4513537,5,B00508VTIE,"This is one of my favorite hiking DVDs. I really love the odd, unique beauty of the SW. It is somehow attention grabbing and therapeutic to watch while walking on the treadmill. Also, the pace is a tiny bit faster than I find realistic for hiking, but it is certainly easy to overlook this flaw with all the gorgeous scenery wowing you at every turn. I highly recommend this DVD.",1354320000,,379,4.428571428571429
4513538,3,B00508VTIE,"I attempted to find the video resolution of the downloadable videos but I can't find this information anywhere.
Only after purchasing the downloadable videos did I find they have substandard video resolution (640 x 360).
Unfortunately, I had to purchase the DVD to get a reasonable resolution. (720 x 480)

That said, there are no other vidoes in this genre that do anywhere near as good a job at image stabilization.
My recommendation is that if you are using a small screen, the downloadable content should be fine, but if you are planning on using a large screen TV, spend the extra money on the DVD's.

Subject to this one caveat, I would definately recommend the hike and running series.",1348358400,2,692,4.758333333333334
4513539,5,B00508VTIE,"I get bored working out on a machine and this video makes it so much more interesting--I really feel like I am going somewhere!  The music is good--it has a good beat.  The scenery is interesting.  However, I like to run for an hour and this video is only 30 minutes long and then they go into a cool down.",1347408000,2,306,4.066666666666666
4513540,5,B00508VTIE,"I live on the Oregon coast, so needless to say my outdoor running season is pretty short. The virtual active video kept me surprisingly entertained, although I wish it was longer. I even found myself ""jumping"" over rocks and branches on the virtual trail. Don't know how many times I will be able to keep watching the same video, but this is a great alternative to bad TV.",1344902400,2,372,4.485294117647059
4513541,1,B00508VTIE,"Honestly, I was excited when I saw this title. But I ended up very disappointed. The production was embarrassing. Almost like it was shot on an old cell phone while blindfolded. Virtual garbage. Not to mention how uninteresting it was. Better off with Oprah reruns. How in the world can you film in gorgeous Southwest and make it this boring and unwatchable? And what's with the silly insert? Please just show me scenery and don't clutter up my screen. And the soundtrack was downright annoying- I finally had to turn it off while I was working out on my morning exercise station. I can't believe they're actually charging money for this. The five star  review is clearly written by the maker. Don`t get fooled and don't waste your money.  There's much better work-out DVDs on the market. For example, check out the DVD ""Trail Running.""",1327708800,2,836,4.758620689655173
4513542,5,B00508VTIE,"This hike is wish-I-had-a-better-word-than amazing! I was just gaping at the scenery. The video really transports you, the treadmill is gone! I have a really bad knee, and there is no way I could walk in some of those places, but now I don't have to!  (I know, stop with the exclamation marks, but that's how I feel!) I love the fact that this video has a guided hike or I can choose to just hike without it. Definitely worth the $.",1323993600,4,432,4.2682926829268295
8450886,5,B00508VTIE,"I have a tv setup in front of my treadmill and I figured I would give this video a shot.  Great scenery, music and motivation throughout the video.  I gave it 5 stars even though I wish it was a bit longer but beyond that it is a great purchase! I am really interested to know how they filmed this (RC Drone, etc.) as the video quality is amazing and very smooth.",1462838400,,363,4.027777777777778
8450887,5,B00508VTIE,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
8450888,5,B00508VTIE,"This is a great video, beautifully filmed! This is helping me plan my Utah adventure!",1431216000,,85,4.733333333333333
8450889,4,B00508VTIE,"This is one of the better hike DVD's by Virtual Active because it has better music with a stronger beat.  The pace I figured is around 3.9 mph.  Perfect for me.  I own 8 of these DVD's now and some of them have really weird ethereal music without a strong beat.  This one has good music so I really enjoy it.  I hope the producers realize how important the beat and the music are on a walking DVD.  For the reviewer who wanted to know how Virtual Active films these incredible scenic programs, check out their web page and you can easily see for yourself:  http://www.vafitness.com/blogs/production-blog",1416960000,,603,4.632075471698113
8450890,5,B00508VTIE,"Keeps me motivated ,  helps me go further without knowing it or feeling too tired. Will purchase other products like this.",1396569600,,122,4.809523809523809
8450891,5,B00508VTIE,"Jaw dropping gorgeous scenery! if only he would not have momentarily cut film when he went around a few corners on the narrow beautiful trails. Also, it was so gorgeous I would have loved for him to look over the cliffs edge a few times. But still very worth getting!  Even though it was a good run, it still worked fine if you went a bit slower on the treadmill.",1394409600,,363,4.185714285714286
8450892,5,B00508VTIE,"I've purchased about 4 different walking videos for my treadmill because I don't want to pay the $10/month for iFit google maps.  By far and away, these videos are unbelievable in quality, footage, scenery, pace, and shear awesomeness.  I currently have a 32in flat screen on the table in the room with my treadmill.  I'm upgrading to a 60in screen and placing it right in front of the treadmill.  Now, if I could just figure out how they film this.  I'm going to order the guided hikes in the national parks next.",1365465600,3,514,4.543478260869565
8450893,4,B00508VTIE,"Scenery is beautiful. It was my oversight to miss the word ""Run"" in the title. I use the videos to walk on the treadmill. This is VERY fast moving. Not great for walking. I have others by Johnny Pearman & he does a wonderful job.",1365292800,,229,4.111111111111111
8450894,5,B00508VTIE,"I highly recommend all the Virtual Active DVDs. Yes, I have them all (run & hike versions). I am that addicted to them. They are a real nice mental get-a-way while in your treadmill. I use the basic hike or run feature (no pop up/coaching on the screen) as i only want to see the scenery, with my own music. They do an incredible job keeping the camera steady. You can check out their VAFitness website to see a short clip of the technique. Website also shows short clips of the DVDs.
Currently I am only walking on the treadmill at approx 3.0 to 3.4 speed, but still enjoy all the 'Run' DVDs they sell. I play the VA DVDs on a Panasonoc blu ray player & 42' LG TV, approx 6 feet in front of treadmill, eye level. It's like I am walking right into the scene. I have purchased plenty of scenic DVD workouts and those by VA are by far the best.
I especially enjoyed this Southwest Hike, it was great to visit Angel's Landing...a nice memory of having hiked to the very end of it in person years ago.",1363046400,,997,4.170984455958549
8450895,5,B00508VTIE,I really enjoyed the quality of the video and the coaching from the production staff.  I would highly reccomend this product.,1360281600,,125,4.9523809523809526
