8128614,5,B000G1T4D2,"There is almost no need to review a work on Gojuryu Karate by an 'author' of the level of authority of Chuck Merriman. Mr. Merriman is one of a handful of senior Western practitioners of this unique system of Okinawan Karate and, as such, can be considered as 'expert' a source as is available in this genre.

Most of the demonstrations on the video are actually by another senior practitioner, Paul Enfield, who has spent many years in the UK and US, as well as extensive periods in Okinawa, polishing his skills. This, combined with Mr. Merriman's expert explanations, gives the practitioner great insight into the fundamentals of Gojuryu.

While the explanations are not exhaustive, this work was never meant to be used as a stand-alone means of instruction, but rather an adjunct to training with an instructor. The 'bonus' in buying this set is the interview of Mr. Merriman, covering his own martial art career, and providing some insight into the Gojuryu system.

I use this DVD set in my school as a text and highly recommend it to my students.",1252368000,2,1052,4.769230769230769
