8600996,1,B0041397R4,"I recently received this DVD as a gift. You will not be able to learn how to play the guitar, rather receive an introduction to chords, and a quick overview of how to tune the guitar. You can find much more useful information on youtube. Complete waste of time. The entire viewing time is maybe 15 minutes of the instrument that you choose.",1390176000,,340,4.412698412698413
