1661287,5,B00005S8KW,"GIRL WITH GREEN EYES is a Woodfall film, one of those slice-of-life-in-the-UK pictures produced by Tony Richardson in the 60's, Britain's answer to the French New Wave.  All are generally worthwhile views; this one is marvelous, with wonderful dialogue by Edna O'Brien from her novel, THE LONELY GIRL.  Frequently laugh-out-loud funny and also quietly touching, not the easiest combination to pull off, but managed beautifully here.  Rita Tushingham and Lynn Redgrave are simple and simply perfect as the country girls trying to make a go of life in Dublin, while Peter Finch strikes the proper note of bruised, reluctant romanticism as the object of Rita's pursuit.  Almost forty years old, GIRL's as fresh as paint, could have been made yesterday.  Tonic, rich and rewarding.",1038268800,24,777,5.233870967741935
1661288,5,B00005S8KW,"This is a very stylish story of a young Irish girl's affair with an older man. Part sad, part whimsical, and all around very refreshing, the film winds up being more light and fun than dark and tragic, as one might expect.
The film is wonderfully photographed in glorious black and white, both in a documentary format and a dash of a somewhat ""New Wave"" style. It's an interesting mixture, anyway. In fact, the entire film appears to have been shot on location in Dublin and the surrounding countryside, lending even further creditbility to the documentray styling.
The well-written dialogue is full of engaging double-meanings, and may remind one of ""The Prisoner"", as the lines can be both cryptic, yet very deep and telling. The actors all deliver, too.
The film is very much a product of its time, and captures the feeling of what it must have been like to be a youth in 1963 Dublin. It very much conveys the atmosphere of a ""slice of life"" during the era, as the young girl comes of age.
This is a little-known gem that aspiring film students may find inspirational. Lynn Redgrave's debut film.",1013731200,24,1099,4.670103092783505

7953621,4,B00005S8KW,"I recently re read Edna O'Brien's Country Girls trilogy so ordered the film whilst still in the mood, particularly as I am a Peter Finch fan!  This is a great piece of social history, a nostalgic reminder of the true awfulness of growing up in the '50s and '60s!  It is a slow paced film by today's standards, and not an especially happy tale, but well worth watching. The acting is wonderful, Rita Tushingham isn't a conventionally pretty heroine, but with eyes that show the depths of her soul. A (typical for the time)' guilt ridden Irish Catholic soul.  Hard to believe it is only available from America and cannot be rented on Love Film!",1382054400,,642,4.565217391304348

7953624,3,B00005S8KW,"""The Girl with Green Eyes,"" (1964), a brisk 92 minute bittersweet romantic drama, plays itself out in Dublin, Ireland, and vicinity, where it was filmed, oddly enough in black and white.  Considering that it makes rather a lot of its titular character, a girl with green eyes - which we cannot see. And that viewers are always conscious of the film's setting in Ireland, a land that's widely known to be green.

And Richardson was yet to become the brother-in-law of one of its young stars, Lynn Redgrave, when he married her sister Vanessa.

We meet, in 1960's Dublin, Kate Brady, an awkward and nave,  young country girl, just coming off the farm.  She's played by waifish Rita Tushingham, that not quite pretty, green-eyed favorite of the 1960s, (A TASTE, THE GIRL WITH GREEN HAIR). Kate has just moved in with her best friend, the much livelier, funnier, more outgoing and sophisticated Baba Brennan, played by a young, fresh Lynn Redgrave (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Georgy-Girl/dp/B0009I8QHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Georgy Girl</a>).  Together they meet Eugene Gaillard, a middle-aged, well-to-do, land-owning, sophisticated writer, played by Peter Finch (an Oscar and Golden Globe winner for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network/dp/B000I5SY9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network</a>).  However, Gaillard, who happens to be already married, with a child, although separated - by the Atlantic Ocean, as well as other issues-- is immediately attracted to shy Kate, and ignores the apparently more knowing Baba.  And Kate is attracted right back to Gaillard.  The two quickly become entangled in an intense love affair, which doesn't play well with Kate's rural family when they get word of it.  But Kate does emerge older and wiser. Other well-known players inhabiting parts here include Julian Glover, T.P. McKenna, Marie Kean and David Kelly.

In this picture, Davis's work strongly resembles his mentor's, perhaps in part because composer John Addison, who scored GIRL, also scored Richardson's TASTE, and LONELINESS. It gives the viewer a very close, black and white look at the Dublin, and the Irish countryside, of the early 1960s. Tushingham was perhaps at the height of her popularity at this time: her piquant face seemed to fascinate filmmakers and to embody the `kitchen sink' working class dramas so emblematic of the rebellious era.  There's no question but that the picture hangs on Tushingham's appealing, deeply felt performance, though both Finch and Redgrave turn in strong performances as well.  Worth seeing, though it should have been made in color.",1347667200,2,4129,6.9728682170542635
7953625,4,B00005S8KW,"This movie about a young farm girl and a middle aged writer who's separated from his wife, who meet, meet again and from then on begin to have an afair is interesting.
Rita Tushingham is great. She has very romantic feelings for the mysterious, sophisticated writer and gets gloomier and gloomier throughout the picture.
Peter Finch plays the man whose feelings are not so tender as the young girl and seems to be confused and a little disturbed at times by her passionate feelings.
Four stars because it can get boring and sad at times",1257033600,3,536,4.652631578947369
7953626,5,B00005S8KW,"In this movie,Rita Tushingham's second film,she plays an innocent Irish convent girl.
She takes on a job in Dublin and meets a middle aged not-yet-divorced novelist whom she becomes smitten with.
Before long,she is having her fist affair with him.
In many scenes,she seems so alone. She doesn't understand him and his need to be with his educated and articulate friends who embarrass her and often mention his wife.
She is beautiful in an awkward teenage way,large green eyes,dark silky hair and slim figure.
Vanessa Redgrave as her roommate is fabulous! Vivacious,chatty,foot-loose and fancy free and happy-go lucky.
Peter Falk is terrific in his portrayal of a serious,lonely writer.
Rita Tushingham is equally charming as a bored,lonely young girl.
I'm glad I got my copy before it was discontinued. It's a great movie done in all too real black and white.",1252454400,3,859,5.099290780141844
7953627,5,B00005S8KW,"London's Time Out film guide has remarked that although many of the early sixties British kitchen sink dramas don't hold up well, this little flick has stood the test of time. It concerns a young girl who falls for someone who turns out to be unsuitable for her. It's a fairly common theme, but the filmmakers carefull attention to detail makes it seem fresh. Rita Tushingham never hits a wrong note as the title character,a collen struggling to become an adult with all the gauchness of youth. Lynn Redgrave is also good as her somewhat freespirited best friend. Peter Finch's performance is rather problamantic. He is somewhat remote and detached-but perhaps that's what the script called for. and although he lets the girl down in the end, he is not presented as a villian. He even warns the girl at the begenning that their affair probally won't work as they are so diifferent. But as so often in love affairs, Tushingham has to learn the hard way. A very refreshing performance.",1241654400,7,983,4.754385964912281
7953628,4,B00005S8KW,"Girl with Green Eyes is very much a part of its era, a decade when mores, sexual and other, were rapidly changing. Kate Brady is a 20-ish farm lass just come to  big city Dublin, eager for life and a first taste of love. Gawky as a colt, her greatest wish is to experience grand passion, hopefully  in a ""sophisticated"" love affair. Enter Eugene, nearly twice her age, who finds Kate charming but hopelessly naive. Winsome, shy Kate finds ways of beguiling her way into his affections, and although Eugene makes no secret of intending nothing permanent, to Kate, this budding relationship means everything.

Rita Tushingham as Kate is natural and charming, and a very young Lynn Redgrave, in her first role, provides much needed splashes of humor in her roommate role. The scenes in which Kate's father bulls his way into a resuce attempt are priceless. Peter Finch as Eugene is convincingly worldy and jaded.

Though set in the swinging sixties, the themes of this film are timeless.",1205452800,3,984,4.804733727810651
