5716713,2,B00CDV4Q9A,"The content is fine. Unfortunately I received a made on demand copy which will play for one episode and then freeze up
leaving myself having to remove the disk and play something else. Incredibly frustrating.",1370131200,5,208,4.9714285714285715
5716714,3,B00CDV4Q9A,"First, I must tell you that I've been waiting years (ever since the first Beta & VHS machines came out) for this series.
When I got the set all the disks played great. It's obvious these shows are from the orginal elements.  Not copied off of
a 35mm positive print.

However, I was really disappointed with Disk 7 and the title: ""Solomon's Choice.""  The disk locks up and skips.  Why? Because
the disk is scratched in the case during shipment.  It has a circular scratch, and it's from some type of jagged plastic
in the shipping case.  I sent it back and when the new disk arrived it also had the same circular scratch.  Disk 8 has the same
pattern scratch.

When you shell out $60.00 you should expect quality.  WB really screwed up big time on this one.",1369958400,10,756,4.381294964028777
5716715,5,B00CDV4Q9A,Have watched many episodes on YouTube but quality is often poor to very poor.  The quality of this set of  9 discs is excellent - cannot wait for next lot.,1369526400,3,155,4.133333333333334
5716716,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"Thank you so so so much Warner Archives and Amazon for this much anticipated release.  I have just recently received my copy.  I set aside Saturday nights for re-living some of my favourites, and after the first 2 episodes ""Twenty-Four Hours"" and ""Immunity"", I have found that I am hooked all over again.  The greatness of 1960s television drama lies in its style of storytelling.  I am l o v i n g every moment, and hope that Dr. Kildare Season One dvd will lead to Season Two very soon.",1368576000,18,488,4.388888888888889
5716717,4,B00CDV4Q9A,"""Dr. Kildare: The Complete First Season""  contains all 33 episodes from the 1961-1962 season.  James Kildare (Richard Chamberlain) is an intern in a large metropolitan hospital trying to learn his profession, deal with the patients, and win the respect of Dr. Gillespie (Raymond Massey), the senior doctor in his specialty, internal medicine.

Episodes are well written, and the scripts provide generally good characterization of the patients Kildare encounters.

Based on a successful series of 1940's movies, the show realistically portrays hospital life and the life-and-death aspect of the work.  Among Season One's guest stars are Lee Marvin, Ellen Burstyn, Dorothy Malone, Joseph Cotton, Mary Astor, and Margaret O'Brien.",1368057600,4,727,5.694444444444445
5716718,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"Dr, Kildare and Ben Casey both premiered the same year and were both smash hits. (They were cancelled the same year as well.)  I remember watching both series with my father and mother.  I always preferred Kildare.  Ben Casey was a neurosurgeon and a large percentage of his patients suffered from brain tumors and the like.  It could be a depressing show, as many of his patients wouldn't last the hour.  Kildare, on the other hand, had his share of successes.  Many of his patients came through fine.  (I do remember a tear-jerking episode whose title escapes me, that guest starred Martin Balsam as a dying man concerned about what would happen to his mentally retarded brother, (played by Sorrell Booke,)when he passes away.  Kildare gets involved and helps him.  I do not remember what season this episode was from but it is still very memorable to me.  I do remember that all of us watching at the time were in tears by the end of the show.)
Anyway, Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey were both excellent as Kildare and his mentor, Dr. Gillespie.  I met Chamberlain at a movie memorabilia show a couple of years ago and asked him when Kildare would be coming out on DVD.  He didn't know then, but we all know now.  I greatly look forward to purchasing this classic series.",1367798400,18,1282,4.619469026548672

5716722,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"This is one of the best medical drama's ever made. It stars Richard Chamberlain as the young medic of the title and Raymond Massey as his mentor Dr Gillespie.
This series is like reading a good book. You can't wait to see what happens next and who the guest stars will be of which there were many like Jack Lord, Robert Redford,Charles Bronson and Leslie Neilsen.
The stories are very dramatic and intense for the most part. There are a few lighter hearted episodes as well but it is the more darker episodes that I like best. The crisp black and white photography adds to the suspense of each and sometimes harrowing stories.
 In Season Two, episode two is shot in colour which was to promote colour TV week where NBC took shows that were normally shot in black and white and shot them in colour to promote colour TV's across America in 1962. But I think the show works better in black and white.
The series ran for five seasons and four have been released on DVD.
The fifth and final season went through some format changes in 1965. All episodes were shot in colour and the length changed from an hour once a week to two 30-minute episodes aired twice a week. Don't know why they did this but my guess would be because a year before a series called ""Peyton Place"" hit the airwaves and was very popular and that format was two 30-minute episodes aired twice a week.
The theme song to Kildare became a hit for Richard Chamberlain when it entered the pop charts called ""Three Stars Shine Tonite""
Coincidentally,another medical show came out at the same time as Dr Kildare called ""Ben Casey"" as was just as popular with viewers. It also ended it's run at the same time as this series came to an end.
On Season One there is a episode called ""The Eleventh Hour"" which would go on to a full series of it's own with Wendall Corey.
Dr Kildare is simply one of the great series in TV 's history.",1445731200,,1887,4.3914285714285715

5716725,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"This is a wonderful set.  RC alone is worth watching,totally gorgeous.  Such a picture of life in the 60s.  Even when going to rescue someone, the men donned ties and jackets!

5716735,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"I thought it was great. I knew it would be outdated in many respects. An example is doctors doing ride alongs with ambulances.  This series was way before EMTs and paramedics.

The stories were interesting and I loved the interplay between Gillespie and Kildare. I suspect that Gillespie sees a lot of himself in the emotionally involved Kildare. Even when Kidare is wrong about something, he may admit or even apologize for it. Then he'll continue to passionately argue why he ""feels"" a certain way. When Gillespie pleads with him to grow up (he's only 26 in Season 1), he gives him a slight smile and says, ""Yes, Sir. ""

Chamberlain has often claimed that he became a star before he could act. So, I was prepared for hammy or melodramatic performances.  Such is not the case.

I'm ready to buy Season 2. ",1416700800,2,806,4.601398601398602
5716736,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"I have purchased all three seasons that have been released thus far for this TV series.  I am able to view the discs on my PC without any problems.  The audio and visual quality are excellent.  Having adored this program in my teens, I was eager to see if it lived up to my expectations.  Chamberlain was better in this series than he realized.  He was fairly inexperienced, but he projected so much concern, sensitivity, and intelligence in his performance.  And Raymond Massey in the role of his mentor, was stellar.  I was pleased to read in Chamberlain's autobiography that they developed a rich and genuine friendship.  The two main characters have some shades of gray, but are essentially heroic - which I find refreshing.  Most of the episodes feature a ""message"", but they don't come across as preachy.  The endless parade of famous guest stars is a delight; but it's the regulars (stars and supporting cast) that I enjoy watching the most.  Richard Chamberlain was blessed with stunning good looks.  But as he matured, he became just as beautiful on the inside.  He gained additional fame for his performances on stage, and in mini-series like ""Centennial"", ""Shogun"" and ""The Thorn Birds"" . . . but his performances as Dr. Kildare are very enjoyable as well.",1416096000,4,1267,4.810185185185185
5716737,5,B00CDV4Q9A,These brought back many memories and I found myself going from one DVD to another.  I would have to make myself go to bed at night.  Being a Dr. Kildare fan since childhood I was glad to see them released. they are grainy but what does one expect from films that are so old.

5716740,4,B00CDV4Q9A,"I've found that many of the television programs of my youth do not hold up well across the decades. This, however, is not one of those. Based on characters from a series of 1940s films, this early 1960s series chronicles, at times in soap opera manner, the hardships and triumphs of an intern (Richard Chamberlain), who stands in awe of the senior Dr. Gillespie (Raymond Massey). The stories are well-written, and the direction is top-notch. In addition, we get to see several actors who later achieved television or movie fame, or in a couple cases, aging cinema actors strutting their stuff on the small screen. And to top it off, the music is by Jerry Goldsmith, back when he was known as Jerrald. Although at times dated, as well as occasionally heavy-handed and mannered, this one truly does stand the test of time and is rewarding far more often than not.",1408752000,3,861,4.708609271523179

5716742,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"It is wonderful to watch this old series again.  Watched the show as a child in elementary school.  Seeing it again is quite amazing, as everyone is smoking in the hospital!  The story lines are excellent, and the acting is superb!",1405728000,,231,4.585365853658536
5716743,5,B00CDV4Q9A,I am a huge fan of Richard Chamberlain and have been for at least 50 years. My friend and I have viewed 2 of the 9 dvds of the first season and these episodes are clear and sharp.,1405123200,,179,3.736842105263158

5716747,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"Dr. Kildare was a bit naieve but his heart was always in the right place. The stories are compelling for the most part.  The medical technology seems almost stone aged now. The people are not wooden they appear fully fleshed out just a bit over the time at times. I won't give spoilers here.  the quality of the transfer is generally very good.  Not much hiss and the video quality is good.  You can hear what each character is saying but you mighht have to turn the volume up.  Seems some of the episodes were recorded at a low volume.  Each volume contains a good number of episodes so you are getting your money's worth there.  So many people complain that they divide these old show seasons up into 2 volumes to make more money.  What some people do not know or do not care to remember is that in the olden days when I was young and these shows were new the TV season could have 60 episodes if it was a hit show.  Production values were not that high and money flowed like water since the big three networks were the only games it town back then.  The return on investment of a hit show was pretty much guranteed.

Dr Kildare was a great show.  I enjoyed it and than you would love it too if you like medical dramas.",1398211200,,1220,4.211206896551724
5716748,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"Great medical drama with excellent cast and guest stars. Watch for folks like William Shatner and Harvey Norman showing up in small parts before they became well known.

The Aaron Copeland-like music might get on your nerves (if like me, you don't enjoy that style of music), but that's the only gripe I have. The technical aspects are very accurate for the time. The show obviously had excellent advisors; you don't see cases of ""blast cell leukemia"" in most medical dramas of that time.

Even though this is a Warner Archive release, my set was commercially replicated (pressed, not DVD-R).  You get all 34 episodes (1hour each) over 9 discs, plus the original Kildare version of THE ELEVENTH HOUR. That episode was eventually used for another series with Chamberlain 's scenes excised.",1394236800,2,788,4.954545454545454

5716754,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"Unlike some of the other viewers, I didn't watch this show more than a couple of times  as a kid.  I'm not sure why, probably some other show was selected by the rest of the family in those dim dark days of one tv in the house 4 channels (counting PBS) to choose from.  What made me want the set was the guest casts.  I got it for Christmas this year and have watched 6 episodes so far.  The writing is really really good, Chamberlain and Massey are excellent and so are the guest casts, from the famous players like Suzanne Pleshette and Charles Bickford to the small part actors, some of whom I know, others I don't.  (So far, I have spotted Harvey Korman and Ted Knight in small featured roles.) Unlike Ben Casey, Kildare makes mistakes from time to time and needs to be corrected rather than just guided. Yes, this series is a bit pricy, but for about  43  dollars you are getting over 30 episodes; that keeps it more in perspective.  It's less than you'd pay for one movie night (with snack bar) for a couple.",1388188800,2,1014,4.294736842105263

5716762,5,B00CDV4Q9A,"Like Ben Casey, which was aired at the same time, Dr. James Kildare (Richard Chamberlain) was an intern at the Blair General Hospital. Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Raymond Massey) was the senior doctor at the hospital, and who, Kildare tried to win the respect of.

While Dr. Kildare was fantastic to watch, Kildare was your everyday intern who was naturally attracted to the opposite sex, where Ben Casey was a doctor's doctor, out-spoken and never suffered fools lightly.

While learning his profession, Dr. Kildare had to deal with the mundane things of life, some irate and vicious patients, a doctor who wanted to be a missionary and mental patients among the many other people doctor's have to deal with.

There is a young Peter Falk, who wore a doctor's uniform before he chose to wear a trench-coat, which is not very unusual as many great actors started their careers on shows like these. Even Bill Bixby, Paul Burke, Ken Berry, Suzanne Pleshette, Eileen Heckart and Carolyn Jones spent some time, as well as others, on the series.

The best show of this series, I think, was ""Operation Lazarus"", where doctors Kildare and Gillespie were involved in a study to reabilitate mentally ill patients. It is a subject that many people don't like to talk about, but this story is sad in some respects and also moving at the end when the chosen patients were reunited with loved ones, all because of a new drug being tested.

This first series has ten shows on 2 dvds and I recommend this show for anyone intrested in the old medical dramas, and hope you will not be disappointed. I gave this first series five stars because I still enjoyed it after all these years of waiting to see it again.",1376524800,2,1688,4.6891891891891895

I hope the second season comes out because I can remember the episode with Robert Redford.  I hated him because he was better looking than Chamberlain and there was a rivalry or hostility between them. 50 years later I think I can be less biased. LOL!

I have a few issues when selecting a new episode the sound seem to stutter a couple of seconds before joining the picture and then is out of sync.  This only happens generally at the start on my samsung blu ray player.  The fix seems to be simply to stop the disk using the stop key and the hit play again and the picture and sound restore back in sync.  Hope that helps anyone else with the same issue.  Can't stand sync issue when watching shows with lots of dialogue as it just annoys.,1487808000,,661,4.198412698412699
