2738963,3,B000MQCB1I,"Crude, cheap, but also endearing and snappy.  A real relic of the time period (1971) with horrid fashions and automobiles aplenty.  A mastermind reaches out to 6 expert criminals, anonymously, for a bold heist job.  The men train in seclusion, and are assigned numbers to keep their identities secret.  (Yes, very much like RESEVOIR DOGS.)  A bold cop is the only one to challenge them.

If this were made today, it would (I assume) be much more violent, cruel, and cynical... as is, the film is almost charming in its naivete.  No bystanders are slaughtered, no one lashes out profanely at anyone, the plan is sweetly simple.

Some may be put off by the low-budget, amateurish aesthetic of the pic, but taken in the right frame of mind, it's a modest success for what it is.  3/5.",1268697600,2,781,4.642335766423358
2738964,4,B000MQCB1I,"I've been looking for this film since 35 years ago. I remember having watched it whean I was 8 years old and been fascinated by its original premise. The ending, in particular, is a complete knockout. Of course, nostalgia is something that make many movies appear better that they seem. But ""The Day of the Wolves"" is a total rediscovery. It is a film in need of a remake.",1268697600,,372,4.405797101449275
2738965,2,B000MQCB1I,"manufactured on demand version Review

Picture, Sound quality was garbage.
Lines running through out the movie, light speckles, the sounds jumps when ever the picture breaks up, so you end up missing parts of the dialogue.

I really wish I had spent the extra money on the version that came in the:
Action Man Collection:
Action Man, Peking Blonde, The Big Game, The Day of the Wolves
But I didn't really care about the other movies.

I love, The Day of the Wolves, great 70's made for TV movie, which would have gotten a 5 star had it been presented properly.

I really hope this manufactured on demand garbage goes away.

I will probably break down and buy the version that comes with the Action Man Collection someday.",1268179200,3,721,4.6015625

The action is little, narrow and unrealistic. The dialogue so detached and at the same time hot-tempered. The characters act as if criminals might behave in such a situation.  For a low budget movie, it was made remarkably well.

These 24 double sided DVDs contain 100 different public domain movies. Most of them were produced in the 1930s and 1940s, the prime time for Westerns. Those made before the 1960s are mostly in monochrome, more modern movies are in color. Some of these movies are duplicated in other collections. There are singing cowboys: Gene Autry, Tex Ritter, Roy Rogers. John Wayne is well known for his action movies. The others are: Tom Tyler, Bob Steele, Guy Madison, Johnny Mack Brown, and others. These films are mostly banned from broadcast TV today but were shown during the 1950s and 1960s. These films were produced on a lower budget with a running time of about an hour. You can compare them to current television drama shows.

They represent a past culture. Then most ranches and farms and stores were owner operated small businesses; few national chains or franchises. Some of these stories are set in the 19th century, others have modern settings with automobiles, telephones, and radios. Those set in the 1860s use arms produced after the 1870s!  The right to keep and bear arms was well recognized when these films were made. Many of the stories tell of the struggle for economic independence (like the small businesses against the big corporate chains).

2739021,3,B000MQCB1I,"A very cool criminal caper flick.
Cool 70's cars, fashions and music.
Great music.

A calculating capo culls the criminal class
to assemble a team to pull of a big-time heist:
isolate an entire small town and rip off select
targets on payroll day, split up the dough,
and then ""disappear"".

The mastermind, #1, and the crew, #s 2-6,
assemble at a secret training camp in the desert,
the location of which and the identity of the team
members remain unknown to all except for #1.
After briefing and training, the wolf pack
implements their plan.

There is a subplot related to the police chief
of the unfortunate town and his family that
is well done.

If you like low budget, but well-made
action movies with a very 70's attitude,
then you will like this one.",1308787200,,759,4.5588235294117645
