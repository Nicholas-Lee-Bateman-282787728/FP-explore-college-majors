7978968,5,B0000844KV,"Transformations is probably one of the best volumes of the GTO anime series. Once again Onizuka has done it again with his great instincts and humor. Transformations places the spotlight on the hateful Aizawa Miyabi. Portrayed as a ""princess-like"" student with an evil side, she is not one to mess around with.  Unfortunately, she has met her match with the Great Teacher Onizuka. Pick up Transformations as soon as possible. Trust me, you won't regret it.",1056240000,,456,5.0
7978969,5,B0000844KV,"This volume concludes the series' biggest cliffhanger from Vol. 7...somewhat. Onizuka is presented with a way out of the last volume's problem, but takes a different path, leading Aizawa Miyabi having to top her most devious plan ever, with one that is her most dangerous.
To quickly review what this series is about: Eikichi Onizuka, a former bike gang member, college karate champ, 22 years old and a bachelor, has taken it upon himself to be the world's greatest teacher. With little or no qualifications, he somehow gets accepted into a prestigious school, is assigned the worst class of delinquents and somehow has to control them.
Onizuka has to deal with various opponent-students during the course of the series: bully Aizawa Miyabi, super smart Kikuchi, fatal genius Urumi Kanzaki, and fierce Kunio Murai.
This volume plays like three different stories: first, the conclusion to Miyabi's plans from Vol. 7; second, Japanese idol Toroko's company drawing the ire of local Yakuza, who latch on to Onizuka and crooked cop Saejima's loot of gold bars; and finally, a revisitation of Kunio Murai's ""Mother Complex,"" this time with the idea of marriage thrown around.
This is the darkest volume yet, drawing more than just the students into the scheme. The tension rises between former buddies Miyabi and Kanzaki; the latter decides to strike back on Onizuka's behalf with a plan that sends shivers down the spine for its cold-bloodedness. It's still the same level and mix of comedy and action as the previous GTOs, but with raised stakes.
Again, watching this series in Japanese is *necessary*, not only for the word jokes but because the story has pretty significant differences from the English to the Japanese versionin terms of what's going on. The Japanese vocal cast is far superior, and the vocal intonations better match the facial expressions; the storyline and what they say are far more risque and naughtier than the English dub as well.
If you've been collecting the series up to this point, I don't need to tell you to buy it. If you haven't, you're best off having watched the previous volumes, and may struggle as to who's bad, good, and why if this is your first GTO.",1056153600,2,2188,4.932249322493225
7978970,5,B0000844KV,"If you ever want to watch an anime with a great story line. Characters that can almost be real, this is the one! The storyline and the transition, humor and all other plots that come into this show are excellently done. I highly recommend that this show should be seen. But, to me you won't get a real flair for the character's personalities in this one unless you turn off the english dubbed voices. Just put the subtitles on, trust me its much better. The Japanese Onizuka sounds sooo much funnier. Highly recommended!!! It's a keeper. (Refering to the entire series)",1051833600,,569,4.643564356435643
