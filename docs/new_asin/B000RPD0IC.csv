2874683,5,B000RPD0IC,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loved it. He couldn't wait to relive the playoffs. He immediately watched the Colts - New England game. The DVD's are great because it is just the game. No commercials! We rewatched an entire game in under 2 hours!

 A keepsake for any Colts fan!!!",1193702400,2,301,4.357142857142857
2874684,3,B000RPD0IC,"How can you beat and copy of the playoff run of your favorite team? COATS fan since the mid-70's the Bert Jones era, and have waited a long time for the Vince!

The quality of the game could have been better and two of the games had scratches on them which surprised me, right out of the box. There is this crazy line at the top of each game, and I have no clue what that would be an it is annoying as hell at first then you kind of forget it is there, but in 2007 you can fame the presentation so that it is not visible.

I enjoy seeing those games and will for a long time, for the money not a bad buy, again the quality of the picture could have been much better. I watch them on a macbook.

GO COATS!!!",1193184000,,706,3.8551724137931034
2874685,4,B000RPD0IC,"I am a Colts fan and this is great, to see the games, commercial free. But why don't we get 'Prince at halftime, the way the Steelers got 'The Rolling Stones' halftime show last year on their DVD set?",1191542400,2,200,4.153846153846154
2874686,5,B000RPD0IC,"For all Indianapolis Colts fans wanting to re-live last years Super Bowl run, this DVD set has it all!! From the Kansas City game all the way to the Super Bowl win. I have watched the AFC championship game about 20 times. This is a great gift to give any Indy Colts fan.",1191456000,2,270,4.113207547169812
2874687,2,B000RPD0IC,"I was so excited to get this set as I was finally getting what I asked for from the NFL:  complete games and not highlight reels on DVD.  So, I pop the disc in and low and behold... it's in 4:3 blurry vision.  I've been watching NFL games in HD now for 4 years and was expecting 16:9 versions of the games (silly me; I forgot to ask for that too)!  Not Blu-Ray versions mind you, but standard def 480p 16:9 enhanced games.  Pretty basic stuff for 2007 if you ask me.  I went back on-line to check if this was user error on my part and that it was me who picked the fool screen version by mistake.  Unfortunately this is the only version available, so I'm gonna pass this set on to my dad who still watches fool screen.  I hope this set gets a proper DVD release in the future.
Guess it really was too good to be true.

2874688,5,B000RPD0IC,"These games are great in that there are (obviously) no commercials.  Very well done and the Patriots game alone (probably the REAL Superbowl, sorry Bears fans) was almost worth the price in itself.  As a Manning fan even when he played for the University of Tennessee, it is great to see him finally get the monkey off his back and a ring on his finger.",1190764800,2,353,4.415384615384616
2874689,3,B000RPD0IC,"**NOTE** This review based after watching just one of the four games in this set**NOTE**

As a long suffering Colts fan it's great to have these DVDs to remember a very special season, especially the AFC Championship game that was one for the ages. As I re-watched that game last night, I found myself cheering and pumping my fist again, even though I already knew the outcome.

That said, I was disappointed in two aspects of this DVD set.

1) While the game was broadcast in HDTV, the footage they used for the DVD set was from the standard definition, 4:3 aspect ratio broadcast. Players looked blurry on my 55"" HD-TV. I'm not asking for HD-DVD or Blu-Ray version of the games, but I figure at the very least they could have used the HDTV broadcast footage to create a higher quality DVD and possibly even a 16:9 presentation for the growing number of people with HDTVs.

2) The editing left much to be desired. I would think that people ordering this set would be football purists who want to see the games as they were broadcast, but at times the editors go to a 'compressed game' style, editing out huddles, replays, etc. To their credit, they USUALLY do this reasonably well. For instance, if a team goes three and out on a relatively meaningless drive in the middle of the second quarter the time between plays magically disappears, while late in the game every second--even full time outs--is aired as is. HOWEVER, there were some very key plays in the New England game, specifically Marvin Harrison's fantastic 2 point conversion catch and Reggie Wayne's late-game, almost-fumble that DID NOT EVEN GET REPLAYED ON THE DISC! Additionally, there are times in the presentation when the commentators are cut off mid-sentence to edit out a huddle or a replay. I understand that the NFL does not want to rebroadcast Jim Nance doing an on-air commercial for Rules of Engagement or telling us that the third quarter was brought to us by Sprint, but there's got to be a seamless way to show the full game.

I give it 3 stars because it does allow me to remember and re-live these magical four games. It got those 3 stars before the DVDs even arrived on my doorstep. It failed to earn any additional stars though because of the editing and the decision to use the standard definition feed to broadcast the games.",1189468800,26,2312,4.6292682926829265
2874690,3,B000RPD0IC,"I was a little dispaointed that this is simply the 3 playoff games and the superbowl....no commentary at all. I was expecting a narrated ""road to the Superbowl"" not just a rebroadcast of the games...",1189382400,,199,4.714285714285714
2874691,4,B000RPD0IC,"Overall, it's nice to have all four games that will allow me to relive one of the most exciting times for me as a Colts fan. The picture is nice and the editing is crisp and pretty clean. Each game is around 1 hour and 45 minutes long up to 140 minutes long.

Other than that, no special features. It's strictly the games with the original network broadcast commentary. However, this DVD along with the companion&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-Super-Bowl-XLI-Indianapolis-Colts-Championship-DVD/dp/B000KWZ1PW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL Super Bowl XLI - Indianapolis Colts Championship DVD</a>&nbsp;that was released earlier this season as well as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-Films-Colts-The-Complete-History-DVD/dp/B000GYI34K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL Films - Colts - The Complete History DVD</a>&nbsp;make a nice set for Colts fans.

The one glaring omission is the Prince half-time show. I really wanted to have this as well and I was under the impression from other fans that the Steeler's Road to the Super Bowl DVD included the half-time show, so I'm a little confused as to why the Colts didn't include it, unless I'm mistaken about the Steeler's DVD.

Also, the Steeler's DVD had the radio broadcasters doing the play-by-play. I wish they would have done the same for this one. I really didn't want to hear Chris Collingsworth again during the Chiefs game.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this. I just wish the Prince half-time show was included!",1188950400,8,1567,6.013452914798206
2874692,5,B000RPD0IC,"I will probably get this set since it was great especially for Payton and Coach Dungy to finally win it all.  I may be the only one who thought of this, but I bought the ""Road To Super Bowl XL"" when the Steelers won it all.  I am a huge Steelers fan and would love to see ""Road To Super Bowl IX"", ""Road To Super Bowl X"", ""Road To Super Bowl XIII"", & ""Road To Super Bowl XIV"".  I am sure other football fans would like to see a Road To Super Bowl series and keep them coming every year.  But for the older playoffs, it's getting hard to find a video copy.  I think a nice set for each Super Bowl winner, past and present, would be a great idea!",1183507200,7,643,3.877862595419847
2874693,5,B000RPD0IC,"The Pats-Colts DVD is worth the price all by itself. I still remember watching that game live. It was a borderline religious experience.
The Chiefs game is boring. The Ravens game is a little better and the Super Bowl is pretty competitive until 4th quarter.",1347321600,,258,4.7555555555555555
2874694,4,B000RPD0IC,"I had missed the championship game between Indy and New England. I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was grateful to get the chance to see it, even though I knew the outcome. But this video takes great license with the editing. I would have prefered to see it just the way it was on TV. With the replays, commentary and without the obvious jumps from the end of a play to the beginning of the next.  Too much coverage was cut out of this game. But it was still fun to watch Brady get his butt kicked!",1311897600,,509,4.09
2874695,5,B000RPD0IC,Any Colts fan will love these four discs of the Colts 2006 season playoff run that culminated in the Colts SuperBowl XLI Championship. The only issue is these are standard definition. A HD Blu-Ray version would be nice.,1252713600,,219,4.7894736842105265
2874696,1,B000RPD0IC,"Why, oh why did the DVD producers do such a p**s-poor job when they just as easily could have used the HD version of the broadcast as the master?
I have many, many 480p DVD's and the quality on most of them is quite acceptable on my 55"" HDTV. This is *NOT* the fault of the seller, don't get me wrong, but the producer. At the same time I purchased this, I bought ""SUPER BOWL XLI CHAMPIONS"" by the same group and it was *FINE* viewed on my HDTV. Buyers should very much Beware on this one!",1249344000,,489,4.051546391752577

2874698,5,B000RPD0IC,"Love every minute of it. The whole thing is glorious and don't listen to the few that doubt this. I wouldn't listen to someone that's cracking on the picture quality because its not ""fool"" screen, first of all, learn how to spell and maybe stop concentrating on the resolution and take 2nd grade over again, because that just proves to be too critical, as well as for the other person doubting it because the ""COATS"" DVD picture isn't perfect. I don't trust anyone who is a die hard fan for a team and can't even spell let alone pronounce the team right. Nothing will be perfect with any product and not everyone will have the same luck, so just accept it the way it is and you'll enjoy every minute of this as you rewatch their sweet victory.",1210896000,4,743,4.391304347826087

2874701,4,B000RPD0IC,"All four network broadcast games of the Colts run to Superbowl XLI. Editing was only so so. The broadcast team was straight from the network and I would have liked to have the game called by the Colts on air broadcasters.
I was happy that the half time show at the Superbowl was NOT included. The final DVD should have included the Colts victory parade in Indy along with player interviews.
In all the set was good and a must for any Colts fan.",1203206400,3,444,4.2976190476190474

As luck would have it, he missed seeing the 2nd game of the playoffs so is pretty disappointed that the #2 disc is missing.  I cannot find a way to contact Amazon.com,LLC.

8202282,5,B000RPD0IC,"Road to Super Bowl XLI is exactly that. It is the path the Colts had to take to reach the Superbowl. It is made up of the network broadcasts of the three playoff games and Superbowl XLI. These are the original broadcasts with their original play-by-play in their entirety.

The first game is the Wild Card game at Kansas City in which the Colts surprised the Chiefs by an excellent defensive game which effectively shut down their vaunted running game. The second game is the Divisional contest versus the Baltimore Ravens which, once again, was an away game for the Colts. This matchup against the Ravens was definitely a defensive contest in which points were at a premium. All Colts scoring came from kicker Adam Vinatieri who made good on five field goals which, in a defensive struggle such as this, was enough for the win.

The third game was the AFC Championship game at Indianapolis against their arch-rivals - the New England Patriots. I'm sure, most Colts fans would agree that this was the ""real"" Superbowl for the Colts and their victory was certainly satisfying against the team that had defeated them in the playoffs several times. The Colts certainly exercised some demons by defeating their nemesis!

Of course, it includes the culmination of their season with the victory over the Chicago Bears to be NFL Champions and hold aloft the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Most interesting of all, the Colts won in the rain, despite being a ""dome team"" and doing so with a punishing, clock-eating running game and a swarming defense despite being labeled a ""finesse team"".

This is a must-have for true Colts fans and should be enjoyed over and over again. For the Colts fan, this is a five-star DVD set and worth every penny!",1394928000,3,1727,4.765886287625418
