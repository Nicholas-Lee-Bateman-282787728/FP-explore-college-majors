8381795,4,B002VAA6OW,This DVD shows interview of people using yoga as part of their 12-step recovery programs.  There are also excellent interviews by a solid yoga instructor and treatment center administrator.  It also has a few demonstrations for variety and inspiration.  The production quality is a little off and there were no flashy graphics.  However we need to cut them some slack in these areas because it apparently was totally not for profit.  The DVD addresses an issue that needs to be addressed--the psychological benefits of a good yoga practice.,1347321600,,540,5.090909090909091
8381796,5,B002VAA6OW,"Wow! Watch this 85' film, a moving documentary. If a picture says more than 1'000 words then this is it for anyone suffering from or living with a person suffering from addiction. I do not think any book could explain the benefits (and to a degree the shortcomings) of yoga with equal impact. Listening to ordinary people using our day to day language leaves a profound impact.

Lindsey Clennell, a yoga practitioner and teacher himself, let's a few people share their experiences. Some of the statements are truly moving. Also, think of addiction in a wider sense. Aren't most of us addicted to this or that? This is a Win-Win: there is no downside to reflect on how to free our spirits from addictive behavior, how to successfully address the monkey mind in all of us.",1325289600,2,770,4.661764705882353
