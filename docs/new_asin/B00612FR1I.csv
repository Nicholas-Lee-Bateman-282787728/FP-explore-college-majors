4924180,4,B00612FR1I,"This is DVD with a play time of 80 minutes and they have created two shorter playtimes out of it: one at 46 minutes and the other 60 minutes.  What this meant is that both the shorter rides have 'jumps' in them to jump to the next move.  It is not that distracting, but noticeable. I am okay with it as I don't have 80 minutes during work week to do the full ride, so the shorter rides mean I can still cycle!  One less star due to the editing for the shorter rides!

The moves and changes are very similar to those of current day spin classes, yes the music is not the latest, but like all work out DVDs, there is just enough of the beat to keep you in beat to the rpm that you need to go to: there are speeds, interval s and hills.  The rest is up to you to work harder if you are feeling good, or less if your body is not that cooperative!  The instructions are great even for beginners as she does explain postures and safe riding positions.  Loved it.  Better than the 'spinning' brand so far, hope she comes out with a few more; but for now there is enough variation that I will not get bored anytime soon!",1324425600,21,1112,4.0227272727272725
4924181,4,B00612FR1I,"I don't have any other spin dvd's, so I can't compare this to any at home spin ""class"".  However, comparing this to a gym spin class, it is like having the class right in your living room!  Great cardio workout.  You spend a lot of time standing and hovering over the seat.  I was dying for it to end!  And I only did the express version!  I need to work up to the long ride.  The music is the only thing that I didn't care for.  It needs to be more upbeat. Other than that, it is perfect.  Gets your heart rate up and makes you a sweaty mess! Just what the doctor ordered!  I love Cathe so much, I bought the bike because of this dvd!  I bought a Gold's Gym Cycle Trainer from my local Walmart for $267!  The chain is a tad loud, but the bike is sturdy and solid.  You get a great workout with the 40 lb flywheel!",1320969600,11,814,3.920245398773006
4924182,4,B00612FR1I,"Cathe Freidrich is one of my favorite DVD instructors, and I pre-ordered her new Low Impact Series when it first went on sale.  I was so happy to see that she was going to be including a spinning DVD in this new set, and this one doesn't disappoint!

This is one tough workout, but Cathe makes it fun!  It was sets that are standard in spin classes, including rolling hills, hovers and lifts, standard hill climbs, and a sprint.

The entire workout clocks in at about 56 minutes and includes:

* Warm-up 5:02 minutes
* Ride 45:11 minutes
* Stretch 5:51 minutes

If you are new to spinning, there is also an Introduction that shows you how to set up your spin bike properly so that you can maintain proper form while spinning.  Throughout the workout and especially during the warm-up section, Cathe also gives excellent form pointers, and the concluding stretch does a really nice job of stretchign out your tired muscles.

This DVD also includes three pre-mixes:

* Cycle Max Express 43:13 minutes
* Scrambled Cycle Max 57:22 minutes
* Cycle Max Extreme 79:33 minutes

The reason for the four stars is that the music is a bit bland to me.  When spinning, it's important to have a great soundtrack to listen to, and this one didn't do much to motivate or engage me.  It was also hard to hear the music while I was cycling; I had to turn my TV all the way up to hear Cathe over my spin bike, and, even then, the music was really low in volume.

Although I've seen people on Cathe's internet forum say that they are going to use this workout on other pieces of cardio equipment since they don't have spin bikes, Cathe has said that it's best to actually use it on a spin bike.  If you're in the market for one, I've had the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phoenix-98623-Revolution-Cycle-Pro-II-Exercise-Bike/dp/B0016JLE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phoenix 98623 Revolution Cycle Pro II Exercise Bike</a>&nbsp;for a few years, and really like it.

4924211,2,B00612FR1I,"This is my first non-Spinning DVD, so let me start by saying it's NOT a Spinning workout nor does it pretend to be. That said, Cathe seems familiar enough with the mechanics/terminology of Spinning to make this DVD worthwhile for Spinning enthusiasts like myself. However, beginners should beware. There are many things about this DVD which are inherently dangerous. If you know what they are upfront, you can still enjoy what is a fairly decent ride. So what makes this DVD just OK?

The Bad:
The class, including the instructor, all face in the same direction with Cathe right at the front and the majority of the camera work shot from the front. The class (all women) have obviously been told to smile/grin inanely throughout the ride. Their spaced out smile/grin expressions immediately got on my nerves because it looks to contrived. No one looks like that in a real class! Once or twice Cathe would say something like ""looking great"". How would she know if she can't see her own class?

Cathe makes repeated instructions to engage your core. There is NO focus on abs in indoor cycling. In fact, contracting your abdominal muscles while working out on the bike can inhibit your breathing, so I have no idea what Cathe was thinking of there. Neither could I figure out what she was thinking when, at the end of the ride, she had her class stretch on the bike. That is a huge no-no. You should never ever stretch on the bike primarily for safety reasons.

For many instructors, the class is all about them and unfortunately Cathe falls into that trap. She never stops talking which gets pretty tedious after a while. Despite her constant chatter, Cathe never once mentions cadence or heart rate. She does mention the Perceived Exertion scale, but only 2 or 3 times in total. Using my Spinning Computer I can tell you many periods of the ride were at 50rpm which is well below the minimum cadence of a proper Spinning class. Most of the class seemed to hover around 65rpm. Speaking of hovering, Cathe has a twist on jumps. Spinning jumps are controlled sit and stand movements, with the standing position being upright, your center of gravity directly above the pedals and always using hand position #2. Cathe's jumps have you transitioning from an upright position to hovering above the seat, arms fully extended, hand position #3 and your center of gravity not directly above the pedals. This forces your knee joints to compensate for the lack of stability in the hovering position. That's unsafe and hardly low impact, Cathe! Tut tut!

Cathe does offer several recovery periods throughout the ride, but they're just too short. The point of a recovery period is to recover, i.e. catch your breath, lower your heart rate and mentally prepare for the next challenge. 15 or 20 seconds just isn't long enough to do that. She should know better. Finally, what the instructor does is massively important because the class and you at home will likely copy it. Her bad (read unsafe) habits include: taking both hands off the handle bars to take a drink and tilting her head all the way back so her water bottle is practically vertical. Plastic drink bottles are squeezable so you don't have to do that! Changing the resistance on the fly wheel out of the saddle. Taking both hands off the handle bars to ""stretch it out"" mid ride. Doing these things is extremely dangerous, especially for beginners. A beginner who is unused to the exertion of indoor cycling can have a tendency to become light headed. Therefore, keeping both hands on the handle bars at all times goes a long way to ensuring their stability on the bike and reduces their chances of losing their balance and falling off. Falling off an indoor bike can lead to serious injury. That's why it's important to learn good habits and always be safe on the bike.

Finally, a potentially good point about the DVD is it contains 3 rides of different durations, 43, 57 and 79 minutes in length. However, the 57 and 79 minute rides are not actually that long. They're just edited versions of the 43 minute ride and the editing is horrible. For example, the 57 minute ride starts with the last phase of the 43 minute ride, at the end of which the ride is winding down, Cathe is telling everyone how well they've done and her class are gently dabbing their faces so as to not smudge their makeup (seriously). You blink and to your surprise, the class is powering through a seated flat with Cathe encouraging everyone with her signature ""let's riiiiiiiiiiide"" (seriously). If I'm going to do a 57 or 79 minute ride, I want the instructor to suffer with me and not use editing to cheat. That's a serious cop out. Also, if she knew her DVD would be edited for longer rides, then she should have been way more careful about what she said. For example, the 43 minute ride flows OK. However, about 20 minutes into the 57 minute ride we get a phase from the 43 minute ride where she says you're about half way through the ride. Which isn't true for the 57 minute ride. Very misleading and completely avoidable.

The Good:
The ride is pretty varied which I'm sure would appeal to many. That said, it really doesn't fit into any one of the 5 Spinning profiles (Recovery, Interval, Endurance, Strength, Race Day), but as I said, it's not a Spinning workout. Overall, the ride is pretty decent and provides a challenging workout. The longer rides even more so if you can get past the awful editing.

The music is pretty inoffensive and I found I hardly noticed it since I was working so hard. The BPM really helped in many cases and the choice of tunes did not overpower Cathe's voice/instructions which was good.

Cathe made a good choice of language when adding/removing resistance. Many instructors will use terms like ""add a half turn"" which is meaningless because all bikes are different. A half turn on one bike might feel completely different to a half turn on another bike. Cathe avoided that trap, so kudos there. The little instructional chapter on bike setup was pretty good too.

More kudos for repeated reminders about correct form. As a ride progresses riders, especially beginners, have a tendency to tighten up their wrists, elbows and shoulders. Having an instructor remind you not to do that is very helpful. Cathe could have emphasized breathing and water intake a little more than she did though.

So there you have it. Intermediate and advanced indoor cycling/Spinning enthusiasts will get a lot out of this DVD. I would caution beginners about picking up bad/unsafe habits though. Enjoy your workout!

UPDATE 08/03/2014:
Well, I've tried the longest ride and it is a train wreck. The editing looks like my cat did it. I've also noticed that Cathe's riding position looks wrong - her seat looks too low to me. She also locks out her elbows several times, something which she tells you not to do during the warmup. I've downgraded this to 2 stars. It's poor.",1403395200,8,6916,4.698019801980198

It is great to just pop in the dvd and workout without having to go to the gym and deal with waiting to sign up for a bike or someone to tell you that you took their bike.

4924220,1,B00612FR1I,"I have numerous step and other cardio workouts by Cathe Freidrich that I really like.  I am very familiar and comfortable with the  intensity level she challenges you to do.  I tried spin classes at my local gym which I really liked, but they would fill up so fast that it was always hard to get a bike so I decided to buy my own spin bike and just do it at home.  Although I really like to either watch TV or read while spinning, since I had only taken about 5 classes, it was hard for me to challenge myself to push through the burn when I was on my own and not sit down when it started to get uncomfortable.  So, I decided to try a spin DVD to give me some structure and instruct me on what I should be doing as well as a goal to reach.  I wasn not familiar with any of the instructors in the other spin DVD's so I got excited when I saw that Cathe had one.  Must say I found this CF DVD very boring.  All she did was a short warm up and then she stood up for almost the entire  program.  It was like watching someone fish or deerhunt on TV. Since it was my first time viewing it, I wanted to view the entire workout before attempting it myself.  I can't imagine going through the entire workout which looked so repetitive.

4924232,3,B00612FR1I,"I must admit that I wasn't enamored of this workout. This is the first cycling DVD that I've done, so I can't compare it to other DVDs.  I compare this workout to that of a live class.  I also compare this workout to what I would like to see in a cycling DVD.

This DVD is part of Cathe's Low Impact Challenge Series.  It is the first cycling DVD Cathe has done.  The entire workout is about 56 minutes.  The details:

* Warm-up 5:02 minutes
* Ride 45:11 minutes
* Stretch 5:51 minutes.

This DVD also includes three pre-mixes:

* Cycle Max Express 43:13 minutes
* Scrambled Cycle Max 57:22 minutes
* Cycle Max Extreme 79:33 minutes.

What I enjoyed about this workout:

**The smiles of the cast members.  Brenda is in her element in this workout.  It's also fun to see several Cathe fans as participants.

**The variety of moves.  You'll be climbing hills, doing tempo changes, jumping and hovering.  These are all the moves that you would do in a typical spinning class.

**The low impact nature of the moves.  This was easy on my joints. That being said, it felt like low intermediate or advanced beginner intensity.

**Cathe's form pointers throughout the workout.  As you get tired, your form may start to suffer.  Cathe does all she can to make sure this doesn't happen.

**The separate section on how to properly adjust your bike and also on correct posture.  This is a good reminder.  I'm also glad that this is a separate section so you don't have to hear this every time you want to do the workout.

What I didn't like about this workout:

**The music was blah.  I'm used to the great music of a live class.  I really need a driving beat to get me through.  This music was typical Cathe, it's just sort of there in the background.

**The set seemed very crowded.  I love the fact that Cathe had several of her fans as participants.  However, using three or four people would have been plenty.

**Unless I'm in a live class, I would prefer to have scenery to look at while I'm cycling.

**The workout intensity felt to me like intermediate or even advanced beginner level.  I'm an advanced exerciser and I want my cardio to be tough.

You really do need a spinning bike to get the most out of this workout.  I purchased this workout thinking that I'd use another piece of cardio equipment, but the workout isn't really structured for that.  I have no intention of buying a spinning bike.  Or rather, I have no room in my exercise room for such a bike.  I think this is a sign that I have too much exercise stuff.  I am fortunate that my gym has spin bikes out on the cardio floor, so that's where I do this workout.

I would give this workout a lukewarm recommendation.  You might enjoy this if you like spinning at home.  I would suggest that you watch clips and read lots of reviews before buying.",1325116800,14,2808,4.410958904109589

8490733,5,B00612FR1I,"I have used Cathe's DVD workouts for years and love her!!  These spinning DVDs are no exception.  She is a true professional - extremely focused on the workout and helping you get the most out of it.  Some people say she talks too much and, yes, she talks continuously throughout the exercise, but in an effort to keep you motivated and focused.  She gives you all the important tips on form and function so you get the best results without injuries.  And, yes, she repeats those tips throughout the workout.  She's always talking to you and the people she's riding with in the studio to keep you engaged and energized.  She is working just as hard as she is pushing you to.  And, yes, the music is some studio-generated version almost like the hit songs you know.  However, I don't care.  The music isn't that important to me.....an effective workout is what counts, and Cathe delivers that every time!!  I knew when I chose her spinning DVDs that I would get the no-nonsense, professional workout session that I was looking for.",1483488000,2,1030,4.6353591160221
