1369104,5,B00004XQMU,"I've owned a DVD player for over a year now.  Only in the last month or so have I seen the technology in DVDs exploited as it was intended to be.  DVDs like The silence of the Lambs and Fight Club were packed with so many extras, I didn't see how anybody could possibly get more out of the medium.  When I heard about the Beastie's planned DVD, I figured it would be something that only diehard fans, such as myself, could enjoy.  When I could the Video Anthology yesterday, though, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The Beastie Boys' Video Anthology is one of the most complete DVDs I have ever seen.  It came through with every promise made on the Beastie Boys' website.  There are so many combinations of video and audio, I literally gasped when I first popped it in.  Finally, I thought, I get to use my ""change angle"" button!  With all the commentary from the group and directors (who are extremely funny), you get a new view into one of the most influential rap groups ever.  To all you Beastie Boys fans, GET THIS DVD.  ..., get it even if you don't have a DVD player.  This DVD is a gem that comes around only so often, and you'll be kicking yourself if you don't pick this baby up.  If I could, I'd give it 6 *'s.  To paraphrase the B-Boys, this DVD's got more action than my man John Woo, it's got more hits than Rod Carew.",974937600,,1338,4.237154150197629
1369105,5,B00004XQMU,"I discovered the BBoys around '92 and that 'Check Your Head' blew me away. I have all the albums, I've seen most of the videos and I can't wait till  MCA is finished with the DVD and release it. I've alredy pre-ordered it.  BBoys fans must have this!",968371200,,250,4.1875
1369106,5,B00004XQMU,"I was fortunate enough to have received an advance copy of this new Beastie Boys DVD release.  All I can say is ""WOW!  CRITERION'S DONE IT  AGAIN!"".  Although I'm not a big fan of their music, this 2-disc set  is packed with so much unusual and fun DVD technology that it makes the  music quite bearable and wholly entertaining, even to this non-rap fan!  I  must admit that the Boys are among the most influential video groups of the  last two decades, and this DVD release clearly shows why.
This 2-disc  anthology fully showcases the potential of DVD technology, with most of the  18 videos containing alternate visual angles (a fun and interesting feature  that's almost never used on standard DVDs) and multiple audio tracks.  There are hundreds of possible image and sound combinations, including new  surround mixes, a cappella versions, and more than 40 remixes by famous DJs  and remixers, including many new ones created exclusively for this release.  Loaded with never-before-seen footage and unreleased music tracks, this  special edition also contains a truckload of rare still photos and  exclusive audio commentary by and interview with the band and the video  directors.  And there's also the world-premiere director's cut of  Nathanial Hornblower's ""Intergalactic"" spin-off ""The Robot  vs. the Octopus Monster Saga.""
According to the DVD case, there are  over 100 video angles and audio tracks switchable at any time during  playback, for hours of possible image and sound combinations.  I know that  I've had the DVD set for one week now and I've barely scratched the surface  of everything that's available on this.
One final nice touch:  they've  even included English subtitles for old guys like me (I'm 35) who  absolutely cannot make out what they're rapping about!
An unbelievable  release!  Definitely worthy of the Criterion label.",966297600,98,1857,5.12751677852349
1369107,5,B00004XQMU,"I am really looking forward to this release. Compiled by Adam Yauch (MCA) this will be a collection of every Beasties video.
It will be a 2 disc  set with multiple soundtracks, and be produced by Criterion, the definitive  DVD collection creators.
According to the Beastie's website the content  is huge: over 100 video angles and audio tracks switchable at any time  during playback allowing hours of possible image and sound combinations.  Plus, each song on the DVD has multiple remixes [by Moby, Fat Boy Slim,  Bentley Rhythm Ace....] to be used as alternate audio while you watch the  video.
In addition it includes: New 5.1 surround sound mixes, Acappella  versions, Audio commentary by the band and the video directors, rare still  photographs, storyboards, interview with the cast of ""Sabotage"",  the world-premiere director's cut of Nathanial Hornblower's  ""Intergalactic"" spin-off ""The Robot vs. the Octopus Monster  Saga."" and more...

1369121,3,B00004XQMU,"I was swayed by the glowing reviews of this disc and bought it for my husband, a huge Beasties fan.

It's a great compilation of their videos, many of which we had never seen. The extras seem nice, too. But at the end of the day, it's just a collection of videos. Oh, well. It's nice to have. We enjoyed watching it.

And rest in peace, MCA.",1383091200,,341,4.074626865671642
1369122,5,B00004XQMU,An excellent assembly of Beastie Boy videos.  Just what I needed to compliment my audio collection.  Offered at a great price.,1376784000,,126,4.9523809523809526
1369123,4,B00004XQMU,"This DVD was awesome! I only wish it included the video for ""Fight for Your Right"". Still a great buy for any Beastie Boys fan.",1360108800,2,127,4.12
1369124,5,B00004XQMU,"Yeap, the beastie boys are legend now, and this is their Legacy. They made a difference in the music world and you need to know all of his work. Great videos directed by the most talented directors. You can't miss this one!",1358640000,,223,4.333333333333333
1369125,4,B00004XQMU,"Perhaps the most special material I've ever seen on a disc,  Endless re-mixes, alternate cuts, commentaries, photo galleries,
short films, the choice of watching whole videos from different camera angles,, even optional subtitles for oldsters like me
who want to get their clever rhymes, but need help.

As for the videos themselves there are 18, from the Beastie Boy's early work to 2000, and they range from amazing to silly.
But they're never dull, and even the silly is smart silly, if that makes sense.  These guys are actively embracing their inner
goofballs at times, and that's part of what makes them endearing.

There isn't the cinematic brilliance of some of the very best rock videos (for the most part) but if you are a fan, this set is
indispensable, and if, like me, you're only a casual admirer you'll still find plenty to explore and enjoy.

I do wish the choice hadn't been made to censor some of the language.  On a disc this bold, it's an oddly timid choice.",1355443200,,978,4.690058479532164
1369126,5,B00004XQMU,"The quintessential collection of all time - representing exactly who they are.....
B - E - A - S - T - I - E  BOYS!  Great for the collector of anything Beastie!  I can't get enough of the trio!",1338854400,,194,3.8
1369127,5,B00004XQMU,"The best thing about these guys is their sense of humor and their love of real funk, and both are in full evidence here. Though far from a collection of their best tracks, most of their best vids are here, and with a ton of extra angles and audio tracks etc that make this a fan's dream.

Though no worshiper, I've been a BB fan since buying Paul's Boutique the week it came out (still think that's their peak, along with Hello Nasty), and I love their attitude in general. They like to experiment and their music has always benefited from that freewheeling spirit, as have their videos. They actually groove pretty well as dancers, and the vids of Sure Shot and Alive (my favorite) show them bopping with much joy. Horovitz is the key to this band, to my ears at least, and he not only raps the best but dances with more flow as well. It's a treat to watch him get down and have so much fun here, though Mike and Yauch are no slouches when it comes to having fun. But keep your eyes on AdRock throughout Alive: he's in mellow ecstasy, one way or the other. Helluva lotta fun to watch.

One weak link here are the commentary tracks, which pretty much blow and offer little new or even very interesting info. But with all these video angles and audio tracks to choose from, you'll probably only ever bother listening to the commentaries once.

Criterion set the bar with this collection, and no other band has anything quite as detailed and in-depth for their fans as this. If you are one, or know one, then this would be a truly sweet gift for those who like to get down with that funkyass B-Boy sound.",1333929600,,1602,4.351170568561873
1369128,5,B00004XQMU,"This is a great collection, though there are several videos missing from the collection. There are however many remixes and bonuses that make up for what is missing. I once owned the Sabotage VHS collection, which was stolen from me by my 9th grade History teacher Mrs. Karen Saunders. That was a great collection, and featured video for most of Ill Communication.",1282521600,,364,4.887096774193548
1369129,4,B00004XQMU,Mostly home made type of videos with Beastie humor. I enjoy the music more than the video but together they are a mildly entertaining. If you like Beastie Boys you can't go wrong getting this DVD.,1255478400,,196,4.472222222222222
1369130,3,B00004XQMU,"Love this collection, except that it is censored... beeps all over the place and it kinda ruins it for me. I have been a beastie fan since the beginning, and this is a bit of a disappointment. Criterion should be ashamed for this, as they don't even give you the option of turning the beeps off. Seems this release doesn't follow Criterion's commitment to  preserving the integrity of the artist's work. would have given 5 stars if it weren't censored",1207872000,7,451,4.6375
1369131,3,B00004XQMU,"I'm just writing to echo all the praise for these discs.  It's a great collection and the audio features are very extensive with all the remixes.

NOTEWORTHY:  all songs are CENSORED, shame on you, Criterion.  There is worse language in PG rated movies and TV sitcoms than what gets bleeped out of all the music here.  And I don't just mean the occasional 'f' and 's' words, I mean even the mildest curse words are bleeped out.  Why?  There's no reason whatsoever to alter the music on a DVD release, especially with a publisher like Criterion who have prided themselves on presenting films as they're originally made.  I think the fact that the packaging doesn't specify that all content has been censored is misleading not cool, and I'm only pointing this out to others who might think it's noteworthy when deciding whether to buy this.

3 stars for content, -2 stars for creating a bleeped DVD just so Walmart will stock the title.",1207526400,6,934,4.680981595092025
1369132,4,B00004XQMU,"When I found this compilation will be released by criterion I could not believe it, that means they will treat the videos with the best quality and extras, and i was not dissapointed.
The extra material is great, video angles and mixes that can be switched anytime during the video play.
I remember back when Sabotage was released and frequently played on Mtv back on '94, they were and still are the coolest dudes.
Truly recommended if you like the band.
By the way what happened to the very first videos?",1192838400,3,506,4.571428571428571
1369133,2,B00004XQMU,Basically you get a good selection of videos that you could have seen in from 1989 to 1998 or so on MTV or VH1.  There's other goofy camera things to look at while you listen to the same songs.  Then you can listen to the same songs over and over again with a different beat.  It's 2 discs and each disc runs normally about 30 minutes a piece.  I guess it's worth the money if that's what you want but it's kind of boring after watching it once.  I think the original beats with the original videos are the most entertaining.  When I bought it I thought it would be longer or just better because of all the hyped up talk on here about it.,1168819200,,638,4.064
1369134,5,B00004XQMU,"Great sound and video quality, amost every all yoy need for the perfect collection of beastie video, my only ""down"" was the exclution of geanial videos like jimmy james, time for living, root down (live in tibetean freedom concert"", so wacha want (assassings mix).

I expect a re-edition with the new videos and ""all"" of the videos.",1165622400,,332,4.824561403508772
1369135,1,B00004XQMU,"There is absolutely no reason for leaving ""Fight For Your Right"", ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"", ""Brass Monkey"" or other BB hits off this.  What's next?  A Prince anthology with nothing off ""Purple Rain""?  A Madonna boxset that leaves out ""Like A Virgin""?  Paul McCartney renouncing ""Yesterday""?

Criterion does movie releases so well (OK they had to re-release ""Charade"" because the first version wasn't anamorphic) that one has to wonder what the heck happened here.  It's insane to think someone actually approved the final version of this product - who cares about 45 different versions of ""Shadrach"" if the LTI songs are MIA?  Get Solid Gold Hits instead - that CD/DVD set has the stuff that made the Beasties famous.",1143072000,16,717,4.974789915966387
1369136,5,B00004XQMU,"The Beastie Boys are true superstars and this DVD proves how on top they really are. This anthology offers hours of play with multiple, exclusive audio tracks offered by a wide variety of different DJ's.  It also has cool multiple angles and alternate video themes on the most popular tracks.  Some stand-out mixes are the 'Webb 1' and 'Prisoners of Technology' remix of 'Intergalactic' and the 'Shawn J. Period' remix of 'Body Movin'. The 'Count Bass D' remix of 'Hey Ladies' is so funny and every mix of 'Sure Shot' is great.  Be sure to watch and hear the remixes of 'Looking Down the Barrell of a Gun'. And; of course, there is 'Something's Got To Give', which is especially intense and thought provoking these days.  I could go on forever about this incredible anthology; as many reviewers have, but I'll just be blunt.  This is a must have for any ligit hip-hop fan.  If you haven't seen and heard this yet you're missing out.  Well worth the money to buy your own copy, but you can rent it online too.  ""So won't you listen!""",1140739200,4,1032,4.54054054054054
1369137,5,B00004XQMU,"this criterion collection is definatley worth the money,with so much video footage i can watch this anyday .",1140307200,,108,5.055555555555555
1369148,5,B00004XQMU,"Normally DVD's by bands tend to be boring, even by those bands you like. This however is pure entertainment. The amount of camera angles, remixes, extras et al is quite astonishing. I used to think you couldn't remix Hey Ladies until I tried the others out and my god they certainly have made me have second thoughts about my original belief. I can hardly begin to tell you of the amount of fun this DVD is. It's one DVD that will get many repeat viewings.....even with the remixes involved. You may feel hard done by with the swearing bleeped out which I admit is a little bit unfortunate but that's only a minor gripe when you consider the amount of fun there is here. An essential purchase for every fan.",1111622400,3,707,4.446153846153846
1369149,5,B00004XQMU,"First off, I want to tell you that this DVD is Unbelievable! (It's packed with extras, over 100 video angles & audio tracks switchable at any time during playback).  Everything I've ever seen that has 'The Criterion Collection' written on it, is beautifully put together.  Way to go (Kudos) to another Awesome DVD collection.

Here you have more than 40 remixes by The Beastie Boys, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Fred C., Mario Caldato, Joey Chavez, Colleone & Webb, Count Bass D, DJ Cheapshot, DJ J-Rocc & DJ Truly OdD, DJ Moe Love, DJ Strictnine & Paranorm, Dub Hackers, Egon & Jon Doe, Evidence, Fatboy Slim, Kut Masta Kurt, Large Professor, Latch Brothers, Madlib, Micky Finn & Special K, Moby, Mum's The Word, Mike Nardone, OD, DJ Paul Nice, Peanut Butter Wolf, Shawn J. Period & Wizdom Life, Prince Paul, Prisoners Of Technology, Prunes, J Rawls, Sam Sever & Johnathan Hoffman, Soul Assassins & last but not least 'T-Ray'.

There is also : Audio Commentary by The Beastie Boys & The Video Directors, Including Adam Bernstein, Evan Bernard, Tamra Davis, Spike Jonze, Ari Marcopoulos & David Perez.

You also get The World-Premeire Director's Cut of Nathanial Hornblower's Intergalactic Spin-Off 'The Robot vs. The Octopus Monster Saga'.  There are interviews with the cast of Sabotage, Still Photographs & A Collectible Poster (That is Double-Sided).  Get the Hint, This 2-DVD Set is loaded with extras.

The coolest part about this DVD set is how 'You' the end-user can navigate through this DVD, the way 'You' want to.  Example..  Each disc is divided into two sections.  Section one is The Videos in Sequence.  Section two let's 'You' watch The Videos with Supplements.  Back to 'Section One' all of the videos are presented to 'You' in back to back order, as they were placed on the DVD.  They are presented to 'You' in the highest possible image quality & contains Band & Director commentaries (They are in 2.0 Stereo or 5.1 Surround Audio).  You can use the 'Audio/Subtitles' menu to select audio or subtitles at any time while watching these videos.  Now on to Section Two (The coolest thing I've ever seen).  Here, each video is presented individually with a selection of Supplementary Material (Additional video footage is available on Alternate Angles).  Remixes & Alternate versions of songs are available on additional audio tracks.  See below for examples.

On Disc 1

The song - 'Intergalactic'

Has these 'Video Angles'
1) Final Cut
2) Slo-Mo Lip Sync
3) Fast-Mo Lip Sync
4) Vogue
5) Platform
6) Spin Cam
7) The Jogger
8) The Scientists
9) Officer Side Streets

And it has these 'Audio Tracks'
1) Album Version w/ Sound Effects
2) Colleone & Webb Remix 1
3) Colleone & Webb Remix 2
4) Sever & Hoffman Remix
5) Prisoners of Technology Remix
6) A Cappella Version

(With Video Angles & Audio Tracks you get to choose which Video Angle & which Audio Track combo you would like to make).  Like I said earlier, ""The coolest part about this DVD set is how 'You' the end-user can navigate through this DVD"" (It is way Cool!)  I especially love how 'You' can pick a combo & change it the next time you watch the DVD.  Example :  You pick 'Intergalactic' 'Fast-Mo Lip Sync' (Video Angle) with 'Colleone & Webb Remix 1' (Audio Track) & the next time you watch the DVD, you can pick 'The Jogger' (Video Angle) with 'Sever & Hoffman Remix' (Audio Track).  It's an endless number of combo's that 'You' get to create.

Note :  Some songs like 'Something's Got To Give' have no additional Video Angles or Audio Tracks available.

Another Note :  Some songs like 'Hey Ladies' have Audio Tracks, but no additional Video Angles available.

Yet Another Note :  With this DVD, you get a 'Operations Manual' (Don't lose this, you will need this to guide yourself through the DVD), which helps you navigate through this DVD.  It not only shows you every song in order that it is on the DVD, but it shows you if additional Video Angles or Audio Tracks are available & what they are.  It also has an icon legend with pictures of objects next to each song.  It shows you if there are Alternate Angles, Remixes, Additional Program, Storyboards or Still Photos.

Let me leave you with a few lyrics from one of the greatest bands on the planet!  Let my boys speak out with their lyrics!

All you Trekkies & TV addicts.  Don't mean to diss.  Don't mean to bring static.  All you Klingons, in your Grandmas house.  Grab your backstreet friend & get loud.  Blowin' doors off hinges.  I'll grab you with the pinchers & no I didn't retire.  I'll snatch you up with the needle nose pliers.

I'm a lumber jack DJ Adrock.  If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked.  I'll stir fry you in my wok.  Your knees'll start shaking & your fingers pop.  Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock.

I looked out the window & seen his bald head.  I ran to the fridge & pulled out an egg.  Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair.  Launched that shot & he was caught out there.  Saw the convertible driving by, loaded up the slingshot & let one fly.  He went for his to find he didn't have one.  Put him in check correct with my egg gun.  The egg, a symbol of life.  Go inside your house & bust out your wife.  Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke.  The trigger I pulled his face, the yoke.  Reached in his pocket took all his cash.  Left my man standing with an egg moustache.  Suckers they come a dime a dozen.  And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about boyee.  Yeh, that's right, I'm The Egg Man!

****Now if you are still reading this, and you haven't clicked on the 'Purchase ASAP Button', there must be something wrong with you.  I'm (NOT) making all this up people, this Puppy is loaded & everyone should already own this.  I think I'm going to purchase 2/3 more of these DVD's (In case I wear mine out, from watching it Sooooo many times, & each time you can watch a different version of an Audio Track with Video Angles, to enhance each viewing).  Enjoy Folks, & once you purchase this, don't say I didn't warn you on how Awesome this DVD really is.  Thanks & A Big Kudos to 'Criterion' for putting together a Beautiful DVD (For The Beastie Boys), they definately deserve 'Criterion'!",1111276800,20,7582,4.592233009708738
1369150,4,B00004XQMU,"On the back of each DVD box, The Criterion Collection proclaims to offer ""an ongoing collection of classic and contemporary films."" Why, then, did they decide to distribute the Beastie Boys video collection? While the two-disc set is excellent and quite generous, its inclusion in the Criterion library is something of an anomaly.

First, the positives. The menu design is really cool, alternating between green and blue color schemes. The layout is impressive as well, with commentaries by the band and director for each video. What's most impressive, however, is the way they have edited all the video angles and various remixes so that they still synch up with the final cut! If you don't want to hear the normal version of ""Intergalactic,"" just choose one of the multitude of remixes and the video will still synch up!! Awesome!

Now, the negatives. Firstly, they picked the wrong band to make this music video collection. The Beastie Boys video catalog just isn't that impressive. With the notable exception of ""Body Movin'"", ""Intergalactic,"" ""Sabotage,"" and ""3 MC's and One DJ"", there isn't much else to look at. Early Beastie Boys videos were pretty standard ""fisheye camera lens"" fare. They should have waited until they released the video for ""Ch-Check It Out"" which is, in my opinion, one of their best videos. Also, I'm sure hundreds of folks have already mentioned it, but I cannot deny that the video for ""Fight For Your Right"" is sadly missing from this collection.

Bottom line is if you're a Beastie fan, get this collection now! Everyone else probably ought to wait until they try this kind of collection out on a different band or artist, preferably someone with a more-interesting video library.",1100044800,6,1714,4.986013986013986
1369151,2,B00004XQMU,"Their music is great, the videos aren't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I listen to the b-boys quite a bit, but I don't find a video dvd to have much replay value.",1088726400,2,170,4.029411764705882
1369152,5,B00004XQMU,"Oh my. This is a brilliant DVD. First of all, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that the Beasties make some seriously awesome music videos. Case in point: my brothers are not B-boy fans, but they worship at the altar of Sabotage every time it plays. So compiling the videos (minus those during the Def Jam days) by itself is a fantastic idea. Then, there's the countless different camera angles, often several per video. The stills. The commentaries from directors and the Boys themselves. (Even though theirs don't bring much new knowledge to light. Whatever, even as kickback as their commentary is, it works.) The different remixes. Again, often several per song. The extra clips like the interview with the cast of Sabotage (my sides hurt after that one) and the Intergalactic short. This DVD is so jammed with goodies that you won't want to leave your house. Ever. Okay, for at least a very long time. Bonus points for making everything clear and concise, the instruction manual, and the kick ass Sabotage poster that now resides on my ceiling.",1088640000,2,1061,4.835164835164835

I couldn't believe the additional footage and all the extras that come with this DVD.  The ""remix"" videos are so outstanding.  This is probably the best DVD I have ever bought by any artist.  Don't waste as much time as I did.",1087430400,,336,4.03030303030303
1369154,4,B00004XQMU,This dvd kick's butt!!! there alot are of bonus feature's to keep you entertained for hours. the reason I gave it a 4 out of five is because for some reason they left out the video's from the liscence to ill cd.

Well, maybe. I just wish it had ""Fight for Your Right"" and, even more so, ""She's On It,"" because it would then be perfect. ""So What'cha Want"" (which needs a question mark) is far and away my favorite music video. I think. I haven't seen any music videos but these for upwards of three years.

1369169,5,B00004XQMU,"I just received this DVD collection for Christmas after a month's anticipation resulting from begging a friend to buy it for me.  When I got it I was happy enough just to see that there was a free two-sided poster inside (there's a bonus!), but the real giddy enjoyment came the first time I watched the first disc.  ""The Robot Vs. Octopus Saga"" was pretty funny, and discovering the numerous different angles I could watch ""Intergalactic"" in was even more entertaining.  Oh, and watch the saga in surround sound, it's really cool.
Sure, I was disappointed that a few good videos were left off, like ""She's On It"" and ""Fight For Your Right""--how can you have a Beastie Boys video collection without that integral, classic video?  But that still didn't keep me from spending the first three days of ownership in front of the TV watching every video, owner's manual in hand seeking out all the extra features.  I swear, everyone in my house must've been so sick of hearing ""Sabotage"" because I was watching all the different fight sequences so many times.
Really, this is the first time I've ever used the multi-angle button.  You could spend over an hour (yeah, I did) watching ""Alive"" in all the different angles while playing a different remix each time.  I loved watching my favorite video, ""Three MC's and One DJ,"" in quadri-angle, and even better I was surprised at how clear the picture was since I'm used to the ... quality of the videotape I have some of these videos on.  I suppose that's just a DVD player thing, huh?... This new-fangled electronic stuff...
This DVD collection is perfect for any Beastie Boys fan who maybe hasn't seen some of these old videos (""So What'cha Want,"" ""Sure Shot,"" ""Hey Ladies,"" or the newer but rare ""Body Movin' "") in a long time.  It's also got some good stuff that you probably haven't seen before (""Netty's Girl,"" which is hilarious, ""Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun,"" ""Holy Snappers,"" ""Ricky's Theme,"" and the moving--I know that's cheesy, this whole damn review is cheesy--""Something's Got to Give"").  So if you're considering purchasing it, don't hesitate...to ask someone else to buy it for you!  You'll probably enjoy it more, since you've now saved enough money to buy the other Beastie Boys Anthology, The Sounds of Science, but that's another review altogether...",1009411200,10,2316,4.8085642317380355

With all the options to mix-and-match song and picture, you could tweak with this thing for hours.
Plus, the sound and picture quality are excellent. And the ""Body Movin"" video samples Mario Bava's ""Danger: Diabolique,"" which is pretty frickin' cool.",1008115200,6,631,5.257425742574258

To top it off, you get one of the best menu setups I've ever seen, and a little poster....",998006400,2,509,4.655555555555556
1369174,5,B00004XQMU,"This 2 DVD set is any true fan's dream come true.  I've loved the Beastie Boys since I was a kid listening to to ""Licence to Ill"" on my boombox.  While I've grown out of many of the things I liked as a kid, the Beasties have grown with me.
I love their music.  The Beasties have proven thmselves capable of growth and versatility while keeping everything in perspective. Whenever I'm with a group who can't agree on music, they can almost always settle for Beasties, whether they ONLY like the punk tracks or ONLY like the rap tracks or like me, love all of it.  I'm going to go out on a limb and just say it: BEASTIES RULE!!! If you don't love their music, this set is not for you, you can stop reading this and go try and find the new 'N Sync or Michael Bolton CD or whatever it is you listen to.
Ok, I always like to get my complaints out of the way early, believe me, they'll be brief.  1. Censorship.  It's not that I can't live without the 'f' or 's' words, but it drives me crazy when they are edited from original material, be it movies, or in this case songs.  While Beastie tracks have never been drenched with profanity, they do sprinkle some curse words here and there.  They are noticeably absent from this set for whatever reason.  It's nothing to get riled up about, not even worth a star from my review, but it's a big pet peeve of mine and worth mentioning.  I've returned CD's for the same offense.
2.  Also absent are all those ""Licence to Ill"" video's.  This is probably do to some copyright wars or something.  Russell Simmons maybe?  What strikes me as strange is that, while the songs appear on the ""Anthology"" CD set, their corresponding videos do not appear on the DVD's.  Not a big loss.  REALLY old punk video's like ""Holy Snappers"" do however.  Again, it's a small complaint.
Everything else about the set is absolutely fantastic.  Each video contains a wealth of information.  One of my personal favorites is the inclusion of almost all 'B' side remixes.  I used to own the single for ""What'Cha Want"" which had a ton of remixes.  When I lost it, I was never able to replace it.  I was very pleased to find almost all of the remixes on this DVD all sychronized to the video.  Good stuff.
Using ""What'Cha Want"" as an example of quality, it also contains several alternate angles from the original filming: Beasties in the studio, talking head Beasties, etc. which can be mixed and matched with the different remixes.  While most of them are just good for a quick laugh, it adds variety to something that used to be very static.
There are actually two formats when you want to watch and listen.  The first basic way of watching is by viewing them in sequence, this is the only way to select the 5.1 sound and the commentaries, but you can't select alternate tracks.  The DVD will play from beginning to end without prompting. The other way of playing is as I described with ""So What'Ca Want"".  You select an individual song and then set it up how you like, or view bonus material for that particular track (""Body Movin' and ""Sabotage"" have some cool/funny extras).  You can also switch mixes and angles in mid-play by using the on-screen menu.  I thought this feature was one of the coolest and most practical.
Almost all the songs have alternate tracks and angles, and all of them have Directors commentary and commentary from the Beasties themselves.  While you might not get a huge amount of technical advice if you're a budding director, the commentaries are entertaining and give a glimpse into the Beastie world.
Also, not surprisingly, the disc contains links to the Beaties web site and their various ""Free Tibet"" sites and charity organizations which are all non-profit and rely on donations.  Incedentally, anyone who's owned the ""Tibetan Freedom Concert"" 3 CD set might find it as another good example of how well the Beasties throw together a compilation.  It too contained a wealth of great information, movies and interactive material similar to the stuff on this set.
From a fans standpoint, this is a great set because of all the cool Beastie stuff, from a technical standpoint it sets a new standard for interactive DVD viewing and shows just how versatile the format can be.  Artists should be going out of their way to emulate what the Beasties have done here with a little bit of foresight, planning and a total respect for their fans.  The sad thing is, most artists are either too lazy, too self-involved, or too god-awful to provide a quality product for their fans and customers.  This is why the Beasties are far ahead of the pack.",997315200,6,4582,4.546341463414634

The dvd showcases the best of dvd technology using multiple tracks for both video and audio.  Most songs allow several different angles (which actually are different takes, views, stories) of each video and different remixed versions of the soundtrack.

Naturally a DVD collection of all the Beasties videos sounded great; they have had quite a versatile career in music with each album sounding completely different from the one that preceded.  This aspect of the band's music combined with a DVD that would finally let me take advantage of some of the hyped DVD features not commonly found (alternate angles and soundtracks).  Being able to look at parts of Sabotage, Hey Ladies, or Intergalactic that ended up on the cutting room floor combined with a different remix make this easy to watch over and over.

As to the person below complaing of censorship, note that these videos probably do not exist in an uncensored form. I've seen 3 distinct versions of Sabotage (two before this disc, one on MTV, the other on the Sabotage video) and none have the profanity. It is likely that the material this person wants simply doesn't exist. Also note that alternate versions of the songs are available to watch with the videos, and many of them are uncensored.

Great beatmasters, samplers, rhymers, satirists, music lovers, clowns and punk rock hearts. They are truly one of the best American bands around. And also one of the most experimental in pop music.
I love ""Three MC's And A DJ"" for the multi-camera and on-sync arrangements. And there's no way in hell that can figure out what the hell Mixmaster Mike is doing and how damn well he does it. What a mad turntablist genius!

The options available will make you love this 2 disc set.  There are tons of remixes, a cappella versions, alternate angles that will take you a LONG time to explore them all.  The different remixes alone are worth the price--add all the commentary and videos and you've got an incredible value.
I'm not saying it's perfect.  Some subtitles were censored which is ridiculous and the B Boys commentary is a lot of useless talk with the guys just being guys, ""I think I lost that shirt"" or ""That's my sister's cat"" and ""You look good in that white suit.""  Some people will love all that trivia but I thought they could've done a better job explaining where they were shooting, who was involved, the ideas, etc.  The video directors do a much better job at all that but some were bogus--one in particular was a pre-interview included as commentary over a cell phone that was breaking up--don't worry, you can't tell that the guy can't hear the questions because the sound quality is excellent and he gives a useful commentary--it just felt unprofessional.  Especially when the interviewer asked what he was wearing and he said a ""diaphanous"" ""negligee.""  All in good fun.  Other directors were superb, most notably the ""Something's Got to Give"" commentary explaining the Vietnam shots of nature overlapping with human nature--pristine forests and farms with no signs of military installations or anything being destroyed by U.S. B-52's.  But there are storyboards, the photographs, and the more than 40 remixes are timed to match the over 100 videos!--it is so worth it.
This will make a great gift for a lot of people.  If you're not sure they like the Beastie Boys but they have a DVD player, get it for them.  The layout is very tight, stylishly beautiful and well-designed.  It's full-screen format and sound quality is excellent with many different audio options including Dolby surround, 2.0 stereo, commentaries, etc.  And of course there are some additional options for Free Tibet information: websites, groups, etc.  It took me four hours to get through the first CD because there were so many options and I didn't even finish trying all the different combinations and remixes!",975628800,20,2318,4.892583120204604

In addition to the videos, you can create your own video for each song by choosing from many different video angles and track remixes.

A must for any B-Boys fan; if not for the original unedited videos, but for the new remixes of classic songs.  All of us loathed the fact that Paul's Boutique was not a commercial success, thus spawned next to no mixes.  Here, they try and make up for it.  The scenarios and style of Hey Ladies, Shadrach, Sabotage and others, are classic.
But, for all DVD player owners, this is necessary.  It uses the digital sound to the body shaking fullest and perfectly tweaks all 6 speakers in the surround.  The 6 speaker system enhances songs beyond you CD player which only utilizes 2 speakers.  And the visual clarity is incredible - especially the sectioned, fake-fluorescent menu.
The Beasties and Criterion come through big time.  Didn't have Jimmy James (that strobe light video would have been pretty nice on DVD) or instrumentals of songs (which would have seemed natural for all the wannabe MCs at home to rap along with), and the commentary, though pure Beastie, could have been more exciting (though that's more a personal preference, because it is still hilarious to hear the 3 interact).

The commentary by the Beastie Boys is a nice feature even though their commentary isn't exactly the greatest one I've ever heard but it still is a nice feature to have.  Of course the commentary by the directors of the videos are much more informative, if that's what you want.

This is an awsome DVD except that it is missing one very important music video, the one to ""Fight for your Right"".  Other than that, this is concentrated pure Beastie goodness with something for every kind of Beastie fan.",975024000,,1100,4.576530612244898
7926232,3,B00004XQMU,"Censored? Really, Criterion? It's hard to guess who the intended audience was here. Nice content, great bonuses...and then all the songs are censored versions which is really jarring and needless. Did you guys think 12 year olds were buying a 2-disc set of old hip hop videos from a nerdy restoration company? Is that why you felt the need to do this?",1518220800,,351,4.67741935483871

7926238,5,B00004XQMU,"You don't just get their music videos plainly presented on a dvd , you get the Beastie boys universe condensed into a very special double disc set. This anthology will give you a whole new love for the Beastie Boys, seeing how innovative they were and seeing how their sense of humor shows in each video. Watch in sequence for subtitles and commentary, or with supplements for remixes and angles that push the limits of the DVD itself. Comes with a poster too!",1445817600,,460,4.554216867469879
