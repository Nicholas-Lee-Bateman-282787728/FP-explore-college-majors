3103354,5,B0013D8LFY,"13 Going on 30; I love Jennifer Garner and she was wonderful in this film. This is a movie like ""Big"" only from the female point of view. I think this is an understated film. It has very little in the the extras, but the film makes up for it.

Little Black Book, with Brittaney Murphy as the led. I love  this film and it's whole idea of how daytime talk shows are put together. Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates stole the show. In conculation both of these films are very funny, but they are not award movies.

I highly recommend this pack if you want the films and don't want the how it was made Buy these for a good laugh..",1264377600,2,621,4.073770491803279

8249981,5,B0013D8LFY,"13 going on 30 is one of my favorite movies. It is a great romantic comedy that is more about self realization and growth then it is about romance. The idea that this 13 year old girl gets to see her future and what will happen to her if she becomes popular and shallow. She gets the chance to change her life to the better and become a person who cares more about herself, her morals, and happiness then popularity.

I think the casting was great, I really believe she is 13 instead. I also love him as the lead, I know later one people will see him as the Hulk, but I will always see him as Matt.

The fashion in the show is great too, and so is the 80's music. Also, I love New York and the show is set there. I'd suggest it. It is a feel good movie that will remind you that you should think about life and love with the wonder and ambitions you did as a child.",1384732800,,865,3.9371428571428573
