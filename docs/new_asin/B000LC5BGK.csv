2704215,4,B000LC5BGK,"I am a licensed Social Worker who has worked with addictions for 30 years. This information was not exactly new. However, there are many recovery programs & staff who would benefit from adding this information to their treatment programs. The main mesage to me was that in order to successfully treat the ""cravings"" we need to address the brains chemistry. Although it is not appealing to treat ones drug adiction with another drug ( take methadone for example) the research does merit attention. If there is a medication to help with the cravings then to me it is worth looking into.

  So many people look down on people with addictions and think they have no willpower. True many have stayed sober thru 12 step programs but many more need something else they are not already being offerred. People say the addict ""failed"" the program where I see the program ""failed"" the addict. One key in this documentary is to get addicts into treatment ASAP vs waiting for them to ""hit bottom"". I think the brain chemistry information can be a useful component to adapt into treatment. Then if it works we can save thousands of lives.

  I don't see this as a one size fits all but as an addition to prevention programs along with counseling and 12 step meetings.",1179360000,27,1253,4.672727272727273
2704216,5,B000LC5BGK,"I thought I knew a lot about addiction until I saw this, I now know that it affects all of us either through a sibling or someone at work or another in our family, im my opinion it is a national crisis because it is so pervasive.",1178928000,4,229,3.893617021276596

2704218,5,B000LC5BGK,"I've found Addiction to be a quality addition for my library regarding drug and alcohol abuse. [...]
Not only is the main 90-minute movie a valuable asset, but also the 20-minutes mini-movies help to go into further depth and detail including interviews with experts in the field, understanding relapse as a part of recovery, understanding adolescent addicts, searching for treatment and the CRAFT and CBT approaches to addiction treatment.",1178928000,15,440,5.391304347826087
2704219,2,B000LC5BGK,"I had high hopes for this.  After spending $24.95 to buy it, and watching the first disc, I don't even feel inspired to watch the other discs.  I am an alcoholic myself, and have been sober (thanks to AA) for 11 plus years.  I work in the medical field, and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis.  I found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing.  Perhaps it just shows the hunger of the American people to learn SOMETHING, ANYTHING about the subject of addiction.  It IS a complex subject, and I didn't find any answers here.

I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was.  If it was strictly to educate, I found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that DID'T include some of the most important ideas about addiction.  It was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you couldn't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing, to boot!  If it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction, I didn't feel in the least bit inspired.  I did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling, or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling.  I left the show vaguely confused, not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers.  There were exceptions, of course.  I enjoyed the Night in the ED segment, and I found the Steamfitters to be very ""real"" and human.  Addiction IS a terrible disease, and it deserves better treatment than this.

Probably the main thing that I did NOT like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards ""magic bullet"" thinking, which does a disservice to the addict.  That is, over and over are mentioned ""exciting new medicines"" and ""getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict"", which I find dangerous and misleading.  That is, it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new ""miracle"" drugs touted.  Perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  ""Miracle drugs"" which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years (antabuse and SSRI antidepressants come to mind), and none have a very impressive track record.  In fairness to the show, they do mention some of this, but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next ""miracle drug"".

I was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans, scientific speculation, and such, that there was NO mention whatsoever of any 12 step program, or any proven treatment center such as Hazeldon or the Betty Ford clinic.  Because the reality is, while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine, there are real humans out there in the world who are SUCCESSFULLY HELPING THEIR FELLOW HUMANS TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER.  What a concept!  And without miracle drugs even!

Getting clean and sober is not easy, and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything, and b) not to mention real life programs available now (often free) that have proven track records, and offer REAL hope.

If you like science, be aware that Alcoholics Anonymous has been shown SCIENTIFICALLY in study after study to have THE SINGLE BEST TRACK RECORD AT KEEPING ALCOHOLICS SOBER.  Is it for everyone?  No, but if you want to get (and more importantly STAY) sober, the odds are better with AA as a follow-up (after initial treatment) than with anything else that you can name.  ""It works if you work it"" as they say in AA.  I have no direct experience with other 12 step programs, and so can't comment, but I know that they operate very similarly.  WHY on a show about addiction would they not mention any 12 step program?

I sat with my jaw hanging down as I watched the entire show, and AA was only mentioned twice:  once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for 17 years or something ""through AA"", (that in itself is an amazing accomplishment, and should say all you need to know about AA), and later in the show on the Steamfitters  who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to AA would be somehow 'wimpy' for manly men like them.  I don't where they got that impression, because I've never heard of AA being called 'wimpy' (or whatever term they used).  AA's full of bikers, construction workers, etc., right alongside the doctors and lawyers.  That's the beauty of it: it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries, and shows what we addicts have IN COMMON.  The irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE AN AA GROUP AND MEETING!  I was laughing - there was almost no difference.  So if you want to know what an AA meeting is like, watch the steamfitters.  The sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts.  And the power of ""it takes one to know one"" that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why AA is so effective.  Who wants to listen to a scientist?  If you're an addict or an alcoholic, you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic.  They've walked a mile in your shoes.

So to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah, blah, blah with little real inspirational meat or insight.  If you want some real scientific insight into how this ""brain disease"" works (at least the alcoholic version), try the book ""Beyond the Influence"", available from Amazon.  Good meat there.  If you want to see some good talk from people who have (to me) better insight into the whole addiction thing, search online for the Larry King Live addiction show which featured Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty Ford's daughter from the Betty Ford clinic.  Transcripts are available online.  It was an incredible show.  Coincidentally, one of the ""researchers"" who appears on the HBO special was also on the Larry King show, and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level.  You will see what I'm talking about.",1176681600,35,6295,4.653985507246377

The 90 minute documentary is a gist of 14 parts of supplimentary series (around 5 hours) focusing on drugs and alcoholism in America. The addiction series tries to link go (pleasures) behavior to control (frontal lobe) behavior and how lapses between these create problems in personal life/family/society.

Why internet/sex/po*n addicts, shopoholics are missing in this series? These are invisible WALKING GHOSTS in our world. HBO should have created couple of more episodes (in supplimentary series) on internet addicts, sex/po*n addicts, shopoholics which is another threat to developed countries.

BTW, at HBO web-site, you can download all 14-part supplimentary series as podcast if you have itunes software.",1174953600,6,847,6.6909090909090905

As a healthcare professional, I am frequently astounded by the response I receive when I ask patients what they have lost as a result of their addiction. While the responses range from jobs to cars and money, the room often becomes a lot quieter when the responses include children, families and identity. - This documentary hits on those difficult issues and several others which are present today and continue to present challenges for patients, families and healthcare providers.

millions of americans struggle with addiction and most of them can't get help. chances are, you're affected by addiction in one way or another (yourself, a friend, a family member..) and this documentary does a fantastic job at helping to remove the stigmas from the disease and show the struggles on the way down as well as up. i think america as a whole should be forced to watch this film- it's unparralled.",1174176000,50,623,4.663636363636364

In a footnote in the book, I found a reference to baclofen use laid developed by Dr. Ameisen which has been a literal life-saver in my family. Unfortunately, baclofen, FDA approved for other uses, is long out of patent (and therefore does not have the potential for large income for pharmaceutical companies) and it is taking a VERY long time for double blind studies to demonstrate the safety of the path Ameisen took to break his addiction to alcohol.  It is extremely difficult to get American doctors to prescribe baclofen for alcohol cessation (or other drugs), but there are resources out there if one really searches, and doctors are more likely to consider prescribing it when one has already found the drugs which are approved to have been ineffective for them. There is a French protocol which describes how to use the drug to achieve indifference to substances of abuse.",1398211200,2,938,4.85625

2704509,4,B000LC5BGK,I feel it is a pretty good tool to help educate my patients who are chemically dependent. My patients seem to learn from it. If you work in the drug addiction field this video can be very useful.,1268438400,,195,4.157894736842105
2704510,5,B000LC5BGK,This is a well researched and beautifully presented documentary produced by HBO on the disease of addiction. It is a great tool for the chemical dependency student as well as a great tool for chemical dependency counselors for use in their educational groups.,1256688000,,259,5.046511627906977
2704511,5,B000LC5BGK,"I have a family member living with addiction/alcoholism for 3 years.  I wish I would have seen this film when we first found out about the addiction problem.  A fair amount of redundancy because this was originally a series, its still worth the inconvenience of fast-forwarding through several sections.  I recommend it and I know residential rehab centers regularly incorporate this into treatment - my alcoholic/addict was exposed to it in rehab before the rest of the family saw it.",1256688000,,485,5.0375
2704552,5,B000LC5BGK,"When my dad finally addmitted his own addiction and recieved help at Hazelden in Center City MN, my siblings and I seeked more education on this disease that is addiction. We didn't realize it was a clinical addiction and struggled with the fact that he couldn't 'just' stop drinking. Going to the Family Program (a 4 day interactive program that Hazelden offers the family) and getting the education we needed to not only cope with situation from the past, but how to deal with the future and possible relapses. This video series follows all the ugly faces of addiction and helps you realize that all types of people can have addicition, and that the ear;ier treatment begins, just as with cancer, the more likely recovery is. This has been a tremendous help to us. We would recomend it to everyone. Most likely addiction and cross addiction are somewhere in everyone's lives. The more we learn about the grips of addicition the easier it is to live for today and see a brighter tomorrow!",1252627200,3,989,4.722543352601156

2704557,5,B000LC5BGK,"This DVD set was recommended to me by a treatment provider who came to speak in my class on substance abuse.  Using current research, HBO has provided interesting segments that involve interviews with treatment professionals as well as individuals and families affected by substance dependence.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the topic or to suppliment the educational experiences of students.",1217548800,2,424,5.313432835820896
2704558,5,B000LC5BGK,"This documentary is a detailed and comprehensive look at addiction, its causes, effects, and the types of treatment currently available in the U.S. It should be required watching for all Americans, especially parents and those who think addiction doesn't or won't affect them. Those who have experienced addiction firsthand through their own struggles or the struggles of a loved one will find it particularly helpful. If you have a friend or family member in the grips of an addiction, watching this series can give you insight, useful information, and a renewed sense of hope.",1216339200,3,578,5.159574468085107

2704561,5,B000LC5BGK,"I am a chemical dependency counseling student, I found this documentary to be up to date and even told me things that I didn't learn in lecture. There is a chapter called The Science of Relapse and I would suggest anyone watch it; it gives a detailed description of how relapse happens and what can trigger it. I think that it could even help family members struggling with understanding relapse. Very well executed and not a bunch of pshycobabble. My professor recommended it to the class, I'm really glad I listened to him.",1197158400,14,525,4.655913978494624
2704592,4,B000LC5BGK,"I ordered this DVD set to use in a class that I'm teaching. It is a good overview of addictive behaviors and recovery/treatment methods.

2704595,5,B000LC5BGK,"I recently discovered that my sister was a drug addict and have been floundering looking for good information. This film and the shorts that accompany it have been a real education. The premise that addiction is a disease of the brain is very useful for family members attempting to deal with the pain and stigma of having an addict in the family. The sections on treatment are useful and i hope will give us something to go on. i'm hoping my sister will watch this film too. The documentary is sciency and medical and not at all judgemental or sensationalist. I recommend it to anyone who needs no nonsense explanations of what is addiction, what is recovery, what treatments are available etc.",1192924800,5,695,4.704918032786885

2704597,3,B000LC5BGK,"Strengths:
* - This video does a terrific explaining addiction as a brain disease, the best I've ever seen.
* - They did a great job choosing the experts to interview, they are the most respected researchers in the field today.
* - A segment on parity and the efforts of a steamfitters union to self-insure do a great job illustrating how difficult it is to get decent treatment.

Weaknesses:
* - There is no presentation of recovery. I assume this series is intended to reduce stigma. Without presenting recovery, I fear it will increase stigma.
* - It oversells pharmacological treatments. A lay person I say the centerpiece video with said, ""so all you need to do is get one of those prescriptions?"" They give the impression that the medications are a complete treatment rather than a potentially helpful tool.",1189900800,45,813,4.76595744680851

It helps you understand why you can't just quit, and explains to others why a person simply can't stop drinking or taking drugs. Why can I, or why can't they just stop I don't understand. The addicts and alcoholic ask themselves this, and it eats away at them. Family members disown them because they don't understand why or how a person got their selves in this situation.
