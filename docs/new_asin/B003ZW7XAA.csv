4236418,4,B003ZW7XAA,"PBS introduced us to Kenneth Branaugh as Detective Wallander, the subject of Henning Mankell mysteries.  I find this older series starring Krister Henrikkson equally good.  The plots are pure Mankell bizarre and the cast might actually be better.  Have no hesitation in collecting this series - great entertainment with Volvos running across the countryside, eccentric people, and less effort given to portraying tortured souls.",1295049600,8,428,5.65625
4236419,5,B003ZW7XAA,"A quick comment on Rev. Hernandez's review.  I do find Hendriksson to be a fine Wallander, though not as good as Rolf Lassgrd, who was featured in several cinema versions of the novels (only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Lioness/dp/6305885079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Lioness</a>&nbsp;is available in English).  Glad to see that the Swedish TV series will be sold as NTSC versions in the U.S. market.  These episodes are written by a team of scriptwriters, not by Henning Mankell, but the early episodes in the series are faithful to Mankell's concept and Wallander's character.

At about $10 per episode, these are good value. Each is a mini-film.  They sell for considerably more than that in the Swedish originals.

Of particular impact is Ola Rapace as the young policeman Stefan Lindman -- wiry, dark haired and intense, Ola is the husband of Noomi Rapace, who has made such an impact as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish films based on Steig Larsson's hugely successful trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc.).

Even more impressive is Johanna Sllstrm as Linda, Wallander's daughter.  The series begins just as Linda has passed her exams at the Police Academy, and of course, Kurt gets the dates turned around and fails to be there for her.  She arrives at her first assignment -- in the same police station in Ystaad, the setting for the Wallander novels.  There's a lively, determined tug of wills between father and daughter throughout the first year.  Unfortunately for all of us, Johanna Sllstrm took her own life after the first year of the series.  Some commentators suggested that because of her suicide, Mankell gave up the notion of continuing the Wallander novels by concentrating on Linda as the young police protagonist.

The Wallander television series is now up to episode 45 and it has fallen away badly, as was probably inevitable.  I rented episode 44 this past summer while studying in Sweden and found it centered on a couple of young police officers, male and female, with Hendricksson/Wallander as a distant, tired father figure.

I don't agree with the reviewer's dismissal of Branaugh.  I found the casting appropriate and it seemed to me that the BBC series delivered a well-realized adaptation.  I've purchased all six of the BBC/PBS series.  As far as I'm concerned, the more Wallander, the better!

The Rev. Hernandez refers to 'den orolige mannen' -- that's the title of the final book in the Wallander series, published in Sweden earlier this year.  After the ten-year pause, Mankell gives us a Wallander who has just passed 60 and is more melancholy than ever (the title in English will probably be 'The Troubled Man').  I would like to see any of those three actors in a cinema version of it.",1293840000,32,2803,5.129955947136564
4236420,1,B003ZW7XAA,"Pathetic.  I was not expecting Dragon Tattoo writing and production values, but this is an embarrassment.  There is no Swedish atmosphere at all.  The street scenes could have been filmed on any Hollywood back lot and the scenes in the country look no different than any show set in the US.  Wallander is portrayed as an absent minded buffoon who can not even keep up with what day it is.  His daughter, estranged of course, takes two hours of her first day on duty after graduating from the police academy to solve a crime that Wallander could not even grasp had occurred.  The writing, such as it is, is pure police procedural formula.  Anyone who has seen any US police or detective shows since the 70's has seen this many times.  The plot twist is obvious once all of the characters are introduced.  The bad guys are straight out of central casting and the crimes show nothing original either in manner or execution.  The tone of the entire show can be demonstrated by an event near the end.  Something of a spoiler alert here.  The police are worried about a bomb.  By pure luck they stumble on a van with the bomb.  Without bothering to disable the van, they go off looking for the bad guys.  The bad guys return to the van and drive off.  In the next five minutes, the police manage to recover the van three times but find a way to let the criminals regain control of it each time.  Anybody ever think of taking the keys?  This review is based on all of the first episode and half of the second one.  Having wasted $20 buying it I decided not to waste any more time watching it.",1424476800,,1585,4.366438356164384

4236422,5,B003ZW7XAA,I have been watching on Netflix and want my own copiesthe sad part is that Amazon is selling the 1st season in 4 parts costing $100.  Season 2 and 3 are at a reasonable price.  I have always counted on Amazon to be the better price.  I buy a lot through the year given I have a lot of grandkids and am disappointed in the cost for Season 1.,1420243200,6,340,3.898550724637681
4236423,3,B003ZW7XAA,It was pretty good.  Some poor writing again; not believable at times and does Not follow the books or the characters from the books.  The writing can be so poor that it insults your intelligence.  Even though it has to be viewed in English Subtitles it was okay to follow.,1419897600,,273,4.42
4236424,5,B003ZW7XAA,"I have enjoyed the British version of Wallendar starring Kenneth Branagh, so I thought I would try the Swedish version.  I was a bit undecided about buying the Swedish version due to the need to translate using English subtitles, so I opted to purchase just a few of the Season 1 episodes.  Although it may not be enjoyable or comfortable for every viewer, in the short amount of time it takes the viewer to read the subtitles, you have plenty of time to see who is speaking as well as being able to catch the actor's facial expressions.  This is a well-acted version-the Swedes do not disappoint.  Actually Krister Henriksson portrays the role of Wallendar in a different manner but better than Branagh in my opinion. I do not feel such a need to shake Henriksson like I wanted to do so many times with Branagh.  The British Wallendar's life always seems so bleak and depressing.

  My wondering if I could enjoy the Swedish Wallendar by reading English subtitles was soon put to rest.  I enjoyed these few episodes so much that I went ahead and ordered the remainder of Season 1 as well as Seasons 2-3 of the Swedish version.  No doubt I will still buy Season 4 of the British Wallendar when it is released, but Henriksson does a great job here.  Give this Swedish version a chance and believe me you won't be disappointed.

  On a separate note, I was very saddened after discovering in one review that the lovely young actress who played Linda Wallendar in Season 1 (Johanna Salsstrom) had passed away in 2007 after a long battle with severe depression and personal issues.  She portrayed the role of Linda Wallendar extremely well and will be missed.",1418601600,3,1655,4.61986301369863

Most of the rest were not, though apparently Mankell wrote some or all of the scripts or at least the stories the scripts were based upon. The actor playing Wallander isn't as glamorous or good-looking as Branagh in the BBC adaptation, which I found a plus. This one is more realistic, more gritty.

But I kind of got hooked on them they were so compelling and interesting, including the cultural differences between the US and Sweden.  It is also a different kind of film making than the US that I find refreshing.  And I just love Krister Henriksson whose character is not a superhero, has faults which he is beginning to see and even trying to change some.  It can get gruesome at times but I guess that is no different than what we watch here.  So anyway, we decided to purchase all of the episodes from the beginning and have loved watching them this summer when there is nothing on TV.

What I am not so delighted about is the price!!!  I do not mind paying something to rent/buy the show ( I love it so much) but the price Amazon is charging should be labeled ""Grand Larceny"".  If this were just a single Blockbuster movie that price for one showing might be fine, but as this is a series  of 13 episodes there should be some kind of price break for subscribing as a season entity.

4236445,5,B003ZW7XAA,"Had watched Season 2 prior to seeing Season 1.  I didn't even know there WAS a Season 1.  For me, the first season is even better than the second.  Mainly because of Johanna Sallstrom as Linda Wallander.  After about the third episode I looked up this actress and was shocked and saddened to find out what became of her.  Knowing makes me watch the remaining episodes with new eyes, more appreciation and a wish to turn back the clock for her.  Krister Henriksson is amazing and I will follow his career now.  If you don't like subtitles watch this anyway.  It's easy and you will not even notice after a short while.  Sweden's ""Wallander"" series is superior to 99.9% of all TV and films, in my opinion.",1391212800,,703,4.47244094488189
4236446,3,B003ZW7XAA,I watched the 2nd season first and just loved it.  Now watching the first season I can see how much the show improved going into the 2nd season.  i would recommend watching the show in order but netflex did not have the 1st season.  I do feel the price per episode of the 1st season is too much.  That is the big draw back for me.  I do not know if I will keep watching it at the price amazon is charging.  If amazon lowers the price I will jump on it.,1389312000,,452,3.858695652173913

4236448,4,B003ZW7XAA,"I came to the Swedish series by way of a thorough end-to-end watching of Kenneth Branagh's UK remake.  While I thoroughly enjoyed Branagh's portrayal, it has the affected quirkiness of an Anglicized production that tries to have it both ways: maintaining its Ystad setting with articulate Brits playing their Swedish counterparts (while thankfully not attempting Swedish-accented English).  It's tough not to snort at the goofiness of Branagh's Wallander examining a Swedish cursive letter in hand and having to read it out to himself in English so it gets through to the audience.  Still, Branagh's character is magnetic to watch.

That said, there's nothing like the real deal.  Even though Branagh has the seal of approval from author Henning Mankell, you get the feeling that Krister Henriksson is the original article - Wallander as Mankell sees Wallander.  I found it interesting to note the difference in the origin of the two productions:  Branagh adapted Mankell's novels directly; the Swedish series saw Mankell either writing or overseeing works specifically commissioned for this series.

A notable difference between the two series is the role of Wallander's daughter, Linda.  Here in the Swedish Episode 1, Johanna Sallstrom's Linda has entered the police force, and her tetchy relationship with her dad is an immediate plot point.  Branagh's Linda, the lovely Jeany Spark, isn't law enforcement material.  Her on/off/on relationship with her prickly father is still a force in the narrative, but it's her outsider status to Wallander's all-consuming work that drives a large part of the friction.

One annoying Amazon-centric gripe: Why do I have hunt down all 13 episodes to work my way through this series viewing?  Season 2 -- as well as all three of the UK editions - are nicely bound into a season's package, but I have to collect all 13 Season 1 episodes individually like a group of marbles skittering way on a hard floor.",1388534400,5,1944,5.133333333333334

I care, I want him to succeed, I want him to be happy. I've watched all the episodes available in America at least twice. Even though Amazon charges a cruel $5 per stream. They are the perfect police procedurals, with just enough red herrings, just enough hidden clues. The crimes can be gruesome and evil, but there is no over-the-top display of blood and gore. Suspense, but not so much that I need a tranquilizer. Best of all, the crimes are solved through teamwork, but with Kurt the wisest, smartest, most experienced, most intuitive detective. His personal life may be lonely, he may not have the best social skills, but he is very lovable. The dynamic between Kurt and his daughter Linda is complicated, sometimes angry, with emotions ranging from resentment to admiration, and always with love on both sides.",1381190400,7,980,4.839285714285714

Branaugh's depiction of Wallender is barely watchable as Kurt becomes more and more detached and unreachable as he descends into a state of depression leading to Alzheimer's. Henriksson's Wallender is low-key, but at least he is still has normal reactions to events and remains in touch with his surroundings. This is a solid depiction of an interesting character and we need to have access to more of the episodes. Another police/crime-drama from Sweden, on a par with this series, is Beck.

4236456,5,B003ZW7XAA,"This series is the epitome of entertaining crime drama television-movie today. The subtitles don't hinder ones ability to enjoy the nuance of the plot line and characters' emotional input - in fact, somehow, the subtitles seem to enhance the experience...I know, unlikely. However, my personal take nonetheless.  The Hero, Police Commissioner Kurt Wallander is a complex, passionate, selfish, giving, older, wise, strong, heels-dug-in honorable man who is exactly where he was meant to be in the life of this character. A sometimes father-figure to his staff of cadets, a romantic interest in the vapors surrounding the separate plots of each movie episode, Kurt is an enigmatic figure throughout the series, each episode igniting another insight into ""the man within."" Finely picked threads of interest will surface now and again throughout the entire series ahead for you, but don't place too awful much impact on them, merely a focus on the fact there are no coincidences; everything is interwoven in some surprising way. Each episode movie has its own substance and merit, this is not to be forgotten for american viewers. One will be surprised at the up-to-the-second status of the investigative procedures depicted here, primarily at the hand of an old guy without a lick of fashion sense, no less. At least those of us not in law enforcement forensics likely shall find new information in this CSI realm, a truly interesting window from way across the pond. As I'm sure this series has inspired in many others, I, too was drawn to the Ystad website, and have invested a bit of time at their historical records and their webcams - quite interesting to put that specific city in context with this piece of art. Yes, that is, indeed, what this series is to me - Contemporary Scandinavian Art at its finest. Be prepared to gaze upon these masterpieces with a box of Kleenex in a room where others won't be disturbed from your whoops of surprise at the fall-down-and-rewind kind of action you will enjoy in these films. They are worth so much in entertainment value allowing us here in the USA to peek into their living rooms in Ystad, Sweden. Wow, they have great furniture, shoes and clothes in Sweden. Who knew they had great movie production too? Now how cool is that? BBC Wallander? Eh, not nearly as gripping story lines, with way too much emphasis on the hero in that series, in my humble opinion of course. Enlightenment came at a bit of ""current event' info I learned, having seen evidence of which in BBC programming. Now I've seen this series, I've come to the circumstantial conclusion this, the original Wallander, is quite possibly the instigator of the current British love affair with all-things-Scandanavian.

I like them all. Lassgard and Branagh can both be so volcanically emotional that Henriksson pales in comparison. Some might say that is a good thing.

I've read ""Before the Frost,"" and as far as I can remember this version is fairly close to the book. I enjoyed it. Henriksson is surrounded by an able cast and like all Wallander dramas, things are always slightly on edge.",1358294400,,538,4.723404255319149

Wallander is a Swedish police inspector who solves very intricate murders. Out of the three versions of
Wallander, with three different actors, this version is the one which departs the most from the Henning Mankell novels.  If you are a fan of the novels, which I am, this can be jarring, to see your favorite novels upended.  If the other two versions weren't giving you the novels verbatim, this would be a bigger problem than it is though.  Since I have seen the other two Wallander versions, this was not a big problem for me as I was more open to a different source adaptation.

Another thing this version does is make two other cops almost as big a role as Wallander himself.  These are Linda, Wallander's daughter, and Stephan, her sometimes boyfriend squad mate. These are both pictured on the box. Again, if the other two versions did this also, I would have serious problems, as it really substantially changes Henning Mankell's wonderful novels. But with this being one of three versions, I enjoyed the adaptation, especially since it gave a younger perspective to the series.  Also, both are very attractive which doesn't hurt.

I notice someone here filed a one star review based on this was Swedish with subtitles.  The Wallander novels have two Swedish language versions and one English language version. The Kenneth Branagh one is the English language version and the only one wherein you will not need to read subtitles.

4236486,5,B003ZW7XAA,"Kenneth Branagh's PBS version of, Wallander introduced me to the character several years ago.  And it was only an accident of seeing Wallander was being released on Netflix with new episodes that spawned my introduction to the Swedish version of the Wallander character.

I enjoy the Swedish version more, with subtitles, than Kenneth Branagh's ... Why?  The portrayed personality in the Swedish version is more believable and less cathartic.  Hearing it in the language that it was written in makes a marked difference because the emotion conveyed by the Author in the books carries better in the Swedish version.  Kenneth Branagh's interpretation is a bit more like, ""Mr. Magoo Fights Depression"" by comparison.

I would be more than satisfied with Kenneth Branagh as Wallander, had I not seen the Swedish version with English Subtitles. Krister Henriksson's portrayal is more believable and more in character to what the Author had intended ...
I will watch Kenneth Branagh as Wallander,  if PBS continues the series ... If only to compare the story lines of those episodes that overlap, as it had with; ""BEFORE THE FROST"".  Both actors gave rock solid performances in their portrayals.  The company which provided the English Subtitles for Swedish version did a fantastic job of not interfering with the story.

If you have seen Kenneth Branagh as Wallander, then seeing Krister Henriksson as Wallander is a fair, must!  Wallander fans won't be disappointed ... Now all I have to do is read the books :D",1357689600,3,1507,5.060728744939271
4236487,5,B003ZW7XAA,"As much as I admire Kenneth Branagh, the PBS remake of this is not up to the original.  Mankell's Wallander (at least the video version) is a more complex, realistic character than the depressed, morose one played by Branagh in the English language version.  Compare the same episode and you'll notice the subtleties in the Swedish version.  Highly recommended.

Was very sad to learn from IMDB entry that Sallstrom apparently took her own life in 2007. Having first seen the BBC version with Kenneth Branagh, I searched for it on Amazon on Demand and found the BBC version along with the Swedish versions. I purchased both One Step Behind and this episode. As I noted in my review of One Step Behind, I have enjoyed all of the various versions. Having read from one reviewer that the series is included with NETFLIX, I am hoping Amazon may eventually load them into the Prime offerings at some point. Currently the MHz1 channel on Verizon FIOS in Northern VA is playing Series 1 on Friday nights for anyone in the area.

Kudos to Amazon however, for their offerings of other series like Zen (brilliant--purchased HD versions from Amazon), Single Handed (also brilliant and on Prime), Case Histories (brilliant but limited run), Murder in Suburbia (excellent/cheeky), Trial and Retribution (very good--although could live without the David Hayman character), et al---so a lot of really good choices to work through for fans of similar programming like Wallander.",1356739200,6,1237,5.034146341463415

Some of them have music from Anna Ternheim and I really liked that, too. Great TV, worth a look, not seen by that many people, you might see it on public TV sometimes. The US version of Wallander is good, too, but this one, is the best. Maybe I just identified with the lead character a bit more than I'd like to admit.",1350864000,,664,4.362903225806452

4236510,4,B003ZW7XAA,"I have viewed the first three series of the BBC and the Swedish versions of Kurt Wallander. Kenneth Branagh plays Wallander in the BBC version and Krister Henriksson the Swedish version, Both of these men give Wallander his due, and they both have merit. I tend to like the Swedish version.

Ystad, Sweden, is a lovely city and Kurt Wallander is a vulnerable man who is always at risk for falling apart. He is a little weary, and his troubles are well known throughout his police department. His wife left him, she is seeing someone else. His daughter has decided to go into the crime business and is a beginning policemen in Wallander's group. He and his daughter have a relationship that is tempestuous at best. She is intelligent, lovely and young,and Wallander's contemporaries can see him in her actions and behavior. A knock off the old block, so to speak.

The Swedish Wallandern is a little less gloomy than the BBC version. He smiles and laughs, and he seems more human. I like him. Krister Henriksson, seems to be looking for something or somebody most of the time, and his actions slip a little when a woman is near.  He is a needy man, and he does not know how to get out of his way or does he recognize right away that he does need someone in his life. Wallander is clever and he is thorough, you do not guess in his division, you find the facts and you solve the crime. He reminds his group of this often, and he always seems to get his man. Wallander is a professional, works long hours, his job has become his life. I admire him.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 94-14-12

We both feel that the tv series is much truer to the character that Mankell created, even though not based directly on the plots of the books. Branaugh's interpertation is melancholy and dark, and the films concentrate on him. Plus, the Wallendar in the books would never have run around with a three-day growth of beard as Branaugh does.

The characters around the Swedish series Wallendar are more developed the the English films, with perhaps a bit too much of daughter Linda. Even though it is in Swedish with English subtitles, after a few minutes you don't notice it much.

Except for one plot, these Swedish episodes do not correspond to the books as the BBC versions do. These episodes are written using the characters in the novels in new plots written just for the episodes. Since Henning Mankell is no longer writing new Wallander novels, the Swedish episodes are a way to get more of Wallander once you finish reading the novels.

While the BBC Wallander episodes are visually stunning, the police work in the Swedish episodes is more believable and more solid (less overly dramatic). I like the interplay between the staff of the police. I also like the portrayal of the prickly relationship between Kurt Wallander and his daughter Linda. Another interesting part of this series is the relationship between Stefan, a police detective on Wallander's team, and Linda.

I haven't seen the Kevin Brannaugh Wallanders yet, but after following a review suggesting these are better, I am far from disappointed.  Wallander competes with Prime Suspect, The Wire, and just about any other crime fiction dramas you can come up with. Intelligent plot lines which keep you on edge without introducing unnecessary quirks, great character development which is believable + continues throughout the series, plus a sprinkling of bad-ass twisted baddies.... and the acting is spot-on!

4236518,5,B003ZW7XAA,"You'll LOVE this series!  While I am a big Kenneth Branagh fan, I truly believe Krister Henriksson IS Wallander! Mr. Henriksson plays a slightly understated Wallander, which does not hurt the complexity of this character and I think allows Henning Mankell's plots to shine through.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone who has enjoyed Mr. Mankell's books!",1295654400,7,349,5.0
4236519,5,B003ZW7XAA,"We in the UK have been fortunate in that the BBC has broadcast all of the Kenneth Branagh,and Krister Henriksson,versions,and the later films featuring Rolf Lassgard.
Many of the contributors to the BBC message boards feel that KB's performance was way too theatrical,portaying Kurt Wallander as so angst ridden as to be OTT.
The Kenneth Branagh films are,to my mind,so centred on him that other characters,with the exception of Kurt's father,played by the excellent David Warner,become cardboard cutouts lacking any real depth,or impact.
The Krister Henriksson series is,for me,far superior.
Firstly,the screenplays,based on stories written by Henning Mankell,were subject to his final approval.
The plots are therefore intriguing,and generally lead into unexpected developments.
Secondly,the various actors are given ample opportunity to display their ability,and thus characters appear as fully rounded individuals.
Special mention must be given to the wonderful Johanna Sallstrom as Linda Wallander. Her performance in the final film of the first series is so real that one forgets she is acting.
The same is even more true for the superb Krister Henriksson,whose consistently understated performance as Kurt is a masterclass in acting.
This series is thoroughly recommended.",1295481600,61,1279,5.772486772486772
