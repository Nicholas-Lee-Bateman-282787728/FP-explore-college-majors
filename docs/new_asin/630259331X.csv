496321,5,630259331X,"This film is a good watch with Jeanette MacDonald  at her best.
The other great attraction is Allan Jones singing the 'Donkey Serenade' to a coy but interested Jeanette MacDonald.",1339718400,3,179,4.966666666666667
496322,4,630259331X,"The DVD is good quality but has no authoring, i.e., indexing or extra features.
The film itself is good but too long.  Less song-and-dance numbers by Jeanette would have improved it.",1334275200,,182,4.870967741935484
496323,5,630259331X,Video was in great shape and came quickly.  I have already watched it twice and will keep it among my keepers.  Donkey Serenade song is so memorable.  Little boy in it is so charming.  Well worth viewing.,1322265600,,204,4.4324324324324325
496324,5,630259331X,"Desafortunadamente la pelcula no funcion muy bien en taquilla. Aunque hay que reconocer que la puesta en escena de las acciones de masas est muy cuidada, como por ejemplo, la entrada de los dos reyes en Madrid y tiene detalles curiosos como, la sublevacin contra los franceses y la breve lucha de los guerrilleros contra un convoy francs. Los ambientes interiores estn tambin bastante bien retratados, como es el caso del caf donde la cantante acta en Madrid o el mismo teatro de Bayona. Los grandes medios de la produccin norteamericana se hacen patentes, evidentemente. No obstante se percibe cierto aire  ""californiano"" en la toma de varios exteriores que pueden no identificarse como genuinamente espaoles. En cambio, en Espaa la pelcula tuvo mejor acogida, puesto que el pblico espaol, cautivado a finales de los aos cuarenta por las producciones americanas, vea con satisfaccin como una de estas producciones reflejaba la lucha contra Francia - que en esos aos tena una relacin conflictiva con el rgimen espaol - en la que la herona sala triunfante. Incluso al final, sta, se poda permitir el lujo de salvar generosamente a su enemigo. La Serenata de las mulas (Donkey Serenade) se pona con frecuencia en los programas de radio, en donde alcanz, por esos aos, bastante popularidad",1315872000,,1286,5.037558685446009
496325,5,630259331X,"Jeanette is truly one of the great stars of the silver screen--a ""triple threat--she sings, dances, and acts.  In ""The Firefly"" she is free of Nelson Eddy's wooden presence and is better supported by Alan Jones who, unlike Eddy, can act.  Jones' contribution is his performance of the wonderfully whimsical ""Donkey Serenade"" popularized by this movie, and more fully enjoyable when seen as performed here.  You may have to be patient with the 130 minute running time but the resolution of the spy versus counter-spy plot is worth it.
Too bad it is not available on DVD.",1293148800,8,569,4.845360824742268
496326,4,630259331X,"Alan Jones has the most awful tenor voice, ugly with weird vibrato.  His persona ain't much either.  BUT.....for the Donkey Serenade sequence alone the movie is worth the price.  Magically matching the musical rhythm to the step of the mules, the boy on the recorder, the the stagecoach driver with some guitar obligato...  However, we do have an attractive man in Warren William, Jeanette's smitten adversary.

If you like Jeanette, you should go for this movie.  She has lots of singing of pretty good songs and gets to be a sneaky spy, homing pidgeons and all.",1251072000,2,563,4.8125
496327,5,630259331X,"This is one of my favorite Jeanette MacDonald movies. Even without Nelson Eddy, this movie is full of wonderful music by Jeanette and Allan Jones. Highly recommended!",1226966400,9,166,5.185185185185185
496328,4,630259331X,"One needs several rating scales to do this video justice. If I were rating it solely on Allan Jones' voice and performance, I'd give it a 5+. Jeannette MacDonald gets a 4 - she probably rates higher but the technology of the time made most women's voices sound shrill and squeaky. As an excellent example of the musical genre of 1930s-1950s operettas it definitely gets a 5. The overall performance gets a 4, and in judging it, one must again do so in the context of the time period in which it was filmed.

All ratings aside, one must admit that most operettas of the years mentioned were pretty superficial in plot, with the standard fearless hero, dimwit heroine, and sneering villian -- who usually had the best part and was the only real actor in the cast. ""Firefly"" gives us a treat in that our heroine Jeannette is far more spunky and sparky than most of her ilk - she's a Spanish spy helping thwart the French invasion of Spain during the Napoleonic wars. Allan Jones is the French agent sent to trap her. After a series of encounters, betrayals, battles and general dashing about, comes the happy ending - this is, after all, an operetta.

The filming and special effects are again typical of the period, and thus must be considered as good as the technology was capable of producing. It's obvious to us today that most of the time Allan Jones was singing ""The Donkey Serenade"" he wasn't really riding a horse but for that time period the special effects people faked it pretty well.

I can't say enough for the music in this film - Rudoph Friml's score is absolutely gorgeous, and further enhanced by the singers and the sumptious orchestal background. If you really like good music performed by equally good musicians, you can't go wrong with this film. Ignore the historical inaccuracies, goofy plot, somewhat hammy performances, and inept effects - just relax, put your feet up, pet the cat, let yourself sink into that glorious music, and enjoy.",1128470400,25,1959,4.672463768115942
496329,2,630259331X,"Yes, the sole reason I sought out this movie was because it features as a villain one of my favorite (and just about forgotten) actors, Warren William. Now, with the same technique, I've come across some really good movies, like ""Cleopatra"" and ""Employees Entrance"", but ""The Firefly"" ain't one of them. And it isn't because it's an operetta--I liked ""Rosemarie"" and ""Maytime"". No, it's because it's boring and extremely unbelieveable. Eventually, I grew impatient waiting for Warren William to appear, and put the film on Fast Forward. Even then, time passed slowly. In addition, I had heard the name, ""Donkey Serenade"" before, but I found that song to be something of a loser too. SO, my advice is, watch some other Jeanette MacDonald movie, not this one.",995500800,4,757,4.968503937007874
496330,4,630259331X,"I saw this movie on TCM and absolutely fell in love with it.  I have seen most of Jeannette MacDonald's films, and this is by far the best performance - singing, acting, and even dancing - she has ever given.  Alan  Jones is a refreshing change from Nelson Eddy, and much more talented.  The  plot is full of love and intrigue (NOT slow as Maltin claims), with  MacDonald as a Spanish spy during the Napoleonic wars, and Jones as the  aristocratic playboy who falls for her without knowing who she really is.  Songs include not only the classic ""Donkey Serenade,"" but also  ""Gianina Mia,"" a passionate and beautiful love song.  This film  is an absolute must-see for any fan of musical operetta.",955065600,67,695,4.614754098360656
496453,4,630259331X,Loved it. It took me back to school holidays when I used to watch Jeanette MacDonald films on TV.,1425340800,,97,4.157894736842105

496455,5,630259331X,"Loved it. Jeanette was never lovelier and she gets a lot of dancing to do throughout the film as she plays the spy very very well. Nice job of acting and double-acting.. Allan Jones is a far better romancer to her than either Mr.-Wooden Nelson Eddy (though I do rather like him in ""Naughty Marietta"") and Maurice Chevalier (toujours gai and even gay-er). Jones delivering his signature piece ""The Donkey Serenade"" is a real delight, as he is in the melodic ""Oh, I Adore, I Adore you, Gianina Mia"". I've seen this film several times now, and it never fails to enthrall me. Great supporting cast, especially the kid, the stage-coach driver, and the mule in ""Donkey Serenade"".",1407456000,5,673,4.711864406779661

VHF doesn't work well with the 50"" plasma television she is trying to watch it on but she is mostly blind and just listening to the movie.",1398470400,,272,3.875
496457,5,630259331X,"I have just seen this movie for the first time & fully recommend it to all musical lovers. Jeanette McDonald is at her best ., One of the highlights is ,The Donkey's Serenade ,sung by Allan Jones.  Very worthwhile .",1395100800,,215,4.375
496458,5,630259331X,The acting was good the story was interesting and the music was wonderful.  Overall it was fantastic and greately enjoyable.,1393372800,2,124,5.2
496459,4,630259331X,"There isn't much to say about this film. Its main reason for existing is the star power of Jeanette MacDonald and Alan Jones. Judging from the reviews, Jones fans and MacDonald fans were mainly attracted by the presence of their star and didn't know all that much about the other star. The plot sounds like it could have some meat to it -- MacDonald as a Spanish spy among French and Jones as the French counterspy sent to find and trap her -- but there is no real suspense. The relationship between Jones and MacDonald develops in the usual manner with Jeanette at first scornful towards her unwanted suitor, but gradually warming up as she falls for his charm.

Of course the reason to see the film is for the musical performances. Coming from the MacDonald camp, Alan Jones was just pleasant. He sang his songs in a pleasing way, but not so I would have suspected him of being a considerable star.

Jeanette MacDonald had top billing and really dominated the film with her very lively singing and dancing. Ultimately the principal attraction of the film is as one of the best showcases of her great talent.",1392854400,,1109,4.595959595959596
496460,5,630259331X,I can't say enough about this movie! Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones are great working together! Their songs will stay in your mind long after you have watched this movie. I wish they would have made more movies together. Highly recommend this movie!,1391990400,4,253,4.906976744186046
496461,5,630259331X,"This is a must buy for light opera lovers.  Jeanette as always is wonderful and Allan Jones is in his best performance. The story, the music and singing are worth reviewing time and time again.  Can't understand why this hasn't been recorded as a DVD",1389744000,,250,4.533333333333333
496462,5,630259331X,"This is a great movie, shot apparently in silver sepia so it is crisp and clean. The story is more believable than most of the period musicals and is moving, exciting and funny in all the right places.",1374710400,,201,4.315789473684211

I loved his acting, and his Marvelous singing voice. also, the fact he really looks like he is really enjoying himself...

I have listen to his CD[ there's a song in the air] which has all the songs he sings in the Firefly and more---So many times since it's arrival a month ago that I hope I don't wear the CD or the Firefly OUT.

Very Happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My mother (and her mother, no longer alive) just loved Jeanette MacDonald movies and took me along to see them when there was a weekly airing of them at my local movie theater when I was about 10 years old.  I loved musicals, so these were a hit with me too!  So glad these are finally released on DVD.  I got it for my now, homebound mother for Mother's Day.

496554,3,630259331X,"The Firefly veers between being ultra corny with a little darkness thrown in and then back to cornball. It shows Jeanette MacDonald in a typical big budget movie musical thats befitting of the era and of the star. Jeanette works very hard dancing with skill and of course supplying us with several songs. She always sang along with her pre-recorded voice when filming. Her acting is serviceable but she was challenged by being shallow and it was in the films with Nelson Eddy that really showed her full range of talent. I'm a fan of Jeanette's and I feel this isn't her best. The real stand out here is the handsome Allen Jones who was a magnificent singer and a natural actor who's charm shown through. Unfortunately, his Hollywood career never really took off.",1346544000,3,763,4.701492537313433
496555,3,630259331X,"love me a spy vs spy film, the plot was most intriguing and Jeanette quite fetching, enjoyed the alluring gypsy camoflauge dance and the portrayal of French Occupied Spain, force all to pay homage to Napoleon, etc., perhaps not as accurate as the history books but 1937 rarely veered far from dance reviews so I enjoyed this film.",1346112000,,330,4.706896551724138

496557,5,630259331X,"Everyone says that the story moves too slowly, and everyone's right. But what is said too
seldom is that this is one of MacDonald's best roles, with lots of singing of her special
kind and even some dancing. (She also plays the piano, and supposedly did her
own playing, though, given the mechanics of film production, this seems unlikely. It
would have been easier to let her mime to any old pianist's pre-recording.)
Allan Jones is fun, too, and he gets the film's best known number,
""The Donkey Serenade,"" which was arranged from a Friml piece called ""Chansonette."" All the
other main numbers come from Friml's stage Firefly, except for ""He Who Loves and Runs
Away,"" which is supposedly by Friml, though, judging from a little bit of research,
it would appear that no one really knows its source. The craziest
thing about this film is that the story hasn't even a shred of a relationship with that
of the stage show. That was a modern-dress piece about a street singer who becomes a
famous diva. MacDonald's Firefly is a spy drama, set during Napoleon's invasion of
Spain.
In short: it's neither a wonderful nor a terrible film in its contents, but MacDonald
fans will really enjoy it. You get your momney's worth, too: it's looooooong.",1339718400,7,1239,4.7407407407407405
7829656,3,630259331X,"The music and singing were very good. Ms. MacDonald did well. The story, however, seemed to be a re-imagining of  Mata Hari. Ms. MacDonald was a singer and spy for Spain against France. The movie was filmed during World War Two, and in my opinion, was made to encourage the population with a heroic romance movie. The plot was improbable and the romantic ending looked contrived.",1519257600,,379,4.742424242424242
