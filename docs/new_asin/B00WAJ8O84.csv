7127066,5,B00WAJ8O84,"So in love with this show. The characters are all believable and the story is so interesting, delving into the lives of both the main 5 as well as the Germans commanders. And since I can't get this DVD anywhere in Australia, so this has been such a great opportunity. Thank you!",1441670400,9,278,4.365384615384615
7127067,5,B00WAJ8O84,Excellent series.  First saw on Canadian TV.  Cannot wait for the following DVD to be available as the last episode was a real cliffhanger!,1438473600,6,139,4.75
7127068,5,B00WAJ8O84,Excellent cast and storyline.  I love the European location.  Exciting and suspenseful.  I'm upset that I can't get Canadian television in California.  I have to wait until the end of the season and order the dvd.  This is well worth the wait.,1437696000,15,243,4.690476190476191
7127069,5,B00WAJ8O84,"This Canadian TV show lasted only 3 seasons; however, represent the best television can offer.  There were no ""throw-away"" episodes, no ""elevator"" episodes; every episode was well written and directed with superb acting.  Even relatively minor characters were very well done and the major characters came to life in a way seldom seen in any medium.  I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in a little known facet of WWII history, to anyone interested in covert operations, and to everyone else who just wants to be entertained.  This series is among the best I have seen, on any subject.  I will watch and cherish these episodes for years to come.",1521331200,2,660,4.90990990990991
7127070,5,B00WAJ8O84,Great show!!! Very engaging with lots of realism. More effort and research shouldve been done into the various uniforms worn by all involved. Especially the German uniforms. But you won't even notice unless you are familiar with Wehrmacht and SS uniforms and ranks.,1518480000,,265,5.186046511627907

7127075,5,B00WAJ8O84,"I stumbled on this series just looking for something to watch, and ordered it after seeing the trailer on YouTube. Best choice I ever made!!! This series is simp,y amazing and a great example of why we must always remember the horrors of WW2 so that they can't be repeated. Suspenseful, great action, and a great ensemble cast. Can't wait to start Season 2 and hope we get Season 3 on DVD soon.",1492905600,2,394,4.410958904109589

7127082,5,B00WAJ8O84,Season 1 starts slowly but then finds its rhythm. Well produced and acted piece. I recommend Season 2 as well.,1479168000,,110,4.55
7127083,5,B00WAJ8O84,Well executed tale of WWII spy operation. Season 1 started slow but then picked up momentum. Season 2 has a more consistent pace and really brings home the horrors of this and all wars on average people trying to live life despite the base pursuits brought on by politics.,1479168000,,272,4.571428571428571
7127084,1,B00WAJ8O84,Much worse than Season 1.  Way too much drama and not enough actually plot to hold my interest.,1477526400,,95,4.277777777777778

7127086,5,B00WAJ8O84,"This is the movie for those who enjoy World War II stories. It is historical, entertaining, has great character development and costuming. The language and scenes are clean.  My sister is watching it now and loves it. Too bad the U.S. is not producing this type of movie.",1474416000,,271,4.645833333333333

7127090,5,B00WAJ8O84,"Excellent. Warren Brown is fantastic as always and the rest of the cast are great, too. Not easy to watch but it makes you want to be a better, braver person. It also makes you contemplate the bravery and sacrifice of that generation and wonder what the world may have become without their heroism. The depiction of so much evil is truly disturbing but the fact that people had the courage to stand against it makes the show ultimately an uplifting one,",1472774400,,453,4.536585365853658
7127091,5,B00WAJ8O84,"One of the best series out, gets better each year. Hollywood puts out garbage but now Canada is taking the lead on great movie intertainment! History is so important, well done Canada!",1471392000,,184,4.78125
7127092,5,B00WAJ8O84,"X Company is a MUST-SEE.  It's beautifully shot, well-acted, and contains historically-based drama and suspense. Production values are top notch from the costumes, set decorations, vehicles, and all-around period of time.",1470700800,,221,6.129032258064516

7127095,5,B00WAJ8O84,"This is the BEST WW2 series in decades, harking back to ""Secret Army"" and ""Colditz"" made during the '70s. I first saw the series while visiting my mother in Canada and subsequently bought the first 2 seasons on DVD. It follows a team of Canadian agents in France (supplemented by a Brit and French woman, plus additional characters - escaped British POWs and Canadians in some episodes). The interpersonal relationships are complex, including intrigue with local SS characters (like Secret Army). The series is a nice merging of drama, suspense and action. Scenes are filmed in Canada, the UK and France (I believe). There are great scenes reminicent of the Great Escape (agents travelling on trains getting their documents checked), hidden radio transmissions, and impersonations of nazis. Uniforms and equipment period correct (MP40 machine pistols, Lee Enfields, Sten guns, etc.). The series starts at the beginning of the war and the second season ends with the disasterous landing at Dieppe (the team charged with destroying a Frieya radar site (which is accurately portrayed) and stealing an Enigma code for transfer to Bletchley Park. This is just a great series!! Check it out!!",1469145600,,1186,5.182291666666667
7127096,5,B00WAJ8O84,"I became a big fan of Evelyne Brochu from watching Orphan Black and bought this DVD to follow her career.  What a great show.  I can't believe I spent the money for 8 episodes of a TV show, but its the only way you're going to ever see it in America.  I'll spend it again for season 2.  I give the Canadian's a lot of credit for airing the show.  It's exciting, dramatic, well written and acted.  More importantly, it manages to tells a story about WWII that is fresh and important.  Evelyne Brochu continues to grow on me as a favorite actress, but also I'm impressed by the entire cast.  Can't recommend it enough!  Thanks CBC.",1468454400,,629,4.3076923076923075
7127097,4,B00WAJ8O84,"Minus one star for no subtitles option.  A bit over dramatic, but an interesting series.",1463011200,,88,4.866666666666666
7127098,5,B00WAJ8O84,"I'm a huge world war 2 buff since I was 5 years old hard to believe. When I heard that this series was Canadian made I was a little hesitant that its not going to be good as U.S made series. To my delight  this series is just as good in  my opinion a tad more exciting than your usual period piece.
I'm proud to say that I'm a Canadian.",1463011200,,336,3.7857142857142856
7127108,5,B00WAJ8O84,"I just finished watching season 2 online and I have preordered from Amazon Canada. I bought season one the day it came out. If you like action, suspense, and edge of your seat entertainment this show is for you. It has a great cast and great stories but most importantly it gives people a real view of what world war 2 was like. The only promise I can make is that you will go preorder season 2 which is available on Amazon. CA and will ship out the first week of May.",1459900800,,468,4.0978260869565215

7127111,5,B00WAJ8O84,Excellent series and quite realistic. I just watched the first part of season 2 at my mother's in Canada. The second season is a runup to the Dieppe raid (a major event in Canadian history). Can't wait to pick it up!! Highly recommended!!,1456876800,2,238,4.558139534883721
7127112,5,B00WAJ8O84,This is an amazing show.  I hope that there will be a Season 3.,1456012800,,63,3.5

7127114,5,B00WAJ8O84,"Although at times predictable, the season ending episode was very suspenseful and I now want to see Season 2 as soon as the episodes air.  However, I'm not in Canada so I'll probably have to wait.  This is a very interesting series grounded in reality and history.  As always, Evelyne Brochu is excellent, as is the rest of the cast.",1450828800,8,333,4.516666666666667

8712604,4,B00WAJ8O84,The show is very good but I find it hard to believe that in occupied France that the X Company can move so freely through Paris and the woods.  Also in Germany they were able to get in and out when most people would be shot.  Other than that I do  enjoy watch it.,1529452800,,263,3.8333333333333335

8712611,4,B00WAJ8O84,"I thoroughly enjoyed this TV series. The acting was very good and the costumes were almost perfect. Being a student of history and serving in the military makes historical accuracy very important to me. I do know a great deal about the German SS during World War II and I noticed that some of the ranks are incorrect. For instance there is an actor wearing a uniform with his collar tabs signifying a Major in the SS, but he is addressed as a Captain. They also have a mix of the wrong period insignia such as having a mix of pre 1942 SS insignia and the post 1942 SS insignia that they used until the end of the war. Im not going to point out every example but there are a few more. To the untrained eye this would not be noticeable, but the show is still outstanding! My only other complaint would be the lack of subtitles. Sometimes when you have actors that speak with an accent it can be very difficult to understand what they're saying. It makes it easier if you can put on the subtitles to figure it out. Other than that I would say almost perfect.",1521676800,4,1055,4.253731343283582
