736885,4,6303921051,"This is a definitive ""B"" movie, but it is great fun to watch.  Two slave girls escape from a slave spaceship only to crash land on a remote planet who's sole permenant inhabitant is a reclusive nobleman.  He always has ""Guests"" because the planet is in a ""Sargasso Sea"" of space.  The problem is, the guests keep disappearing.  The girls soon catch on to his hunting preference and fight back.  Lots of T&A, but nowhere near porn by todays standards.  Fun special effects.",980899200,13,472,4.626506024096385
736886,3,6303921051,A film that quite franlky while the cover is nice and all lacks even a basic plot. What little could be told was two women escaping to find themselves trapped on a planet with a mad hunter.

736887,4,6303921051,"Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity is a must for all low budget movie fans.  It blatantly exploits the 'Most Dangerous Game' script and embellishes on it by having cast Brinke Stevens and Elizabeth Cayton (otherwise known as  Elizabeth Kaitan) in it.
Two beautiful slaves escape a slave spaceship  and crash land on a planet.  On it they meet up with a crazy lunatic who  likes to hunt people.
Basically from then on in it's a hide and chase  movie with plenty of laserblasts from phaser type weapons and tough fights  with skimpy-clad women.

737086,4,6303921051,"After escaping from an intergalactic slave ship, bikini-clad slave girls, Tisa (Cindy Beal) and Darla (Elizabeth Cayton)  crash-land on a strange planet, inhabited by Zed (Don Scribner) and his faithful robot, Vak (Kirk Graves). Also on the planet is the visiting Shala (Brinke Stevens) and her boyfriend. It doesn't take long for Zed to show his inner narcissist, along w/ his more psychopathic, ""mighty hunter"" persona. Tisa and Darla soon find out that other ""guests"" have already vanished, and that Zed has a mysterious trophy room. Yep, SLAVE GIRLS FROM BEYOND INFINITY is a sci-fi take on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. As such, it's not bad. I was pleasantly shocked by this familiar plot, since I was expecting one more 1980s cheeezy schlock-o-thon, complete w/ dizzy dialogue and wall-to-wall nudity (there is some). Don't get me wrong, SGFBI is no masterpiece, but it's a far cry from the stupidity the title infers! While the women do run around barely dressed, they're not portrayed as complete air-heads, and the horror elements of the story still manage to be effective. Scribner is perfectly loathsome in his Zed / Zaroff role. Definitely worth a watch. Keep in mind that the budget for this film had to have been microscopic...",1414195200,4,1237,5.004854368932039

737168,2,6303921051,"I'm officially on a B-movie kick! With so many movies out there that take themselves way too seriously, it's nice to just sit back and watch some old-fashioned B-budget skinema. This one starts out with two slave girls that escape from their prison cells, and board one of their captor's spaceships. Fortunately these spaceships are user friendly, and the bikini clothed slave-babes are quickly able to figure out the controls. Their new found freedom doesn't last long though, because they happen to crashland in the jungle of a planet ruled by Zen. Zen's forte is luring young ex-slavers in bikini's into his jungle palace, chaining them up, and turning them loose into the jungle to hunt for sport. This movie was so fast-paced that our young heroines never had the time to change out of their cloth bikini's. Of all the horrendous dialogue, my favorite exchange went something like this, ""Oh, if only we had a knife"". Her captive accomplice then pulls out a twelve inch switchblade and says, ""you mean, something like this"". ""Perfect"", she replies. Perfect indeed. This film also had bickering androids, laser crossbows, grotesque mutants, and did I mention skin? Fortunately I won't have to re-think my top ten sci-fi list after this one, but when I decide to put a top ten B-Movie skinema with bad dialogue list together- this will be number one.",1238112000,4,1352,4.908296943231441
737169,4,6303921051,"This movie is the retelling of the suspenseful tale ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with a futuristic Sci-Fi setting.  Given the low budget it was made with, it is amazing what level of quality was acheived.  The movie has quite a number of settings:  spaceship interiors, the villian's mansion, ruins, jungles, a beach, and others.  Hence, the movie does not seem claustrophobic.

The acting I found more than adequate.  The heroines were not scripted to be bimbos, and have mostly meaningful conversations.

Most low budget Sci-Fi films are dark.  This one is actually upbeat, which I found refreshing.",1194307200,17,598,5.092783505154639

As somebody pointed out already, in one of the other reviews, it is silly.  The females are cute, above advantage pretty, but not that impressive even when topless.  The sci-fi parts of the story, such as the robots, space ships and zombies, are cool for a 1980's film (if it had been made for TV).  I don't know what they were trying to make.  The story is OK but nothing to dish out money for.  The girls are good looking, as I have already pointed out, but they barely do anything to give the film a R rating.  A mixture of many things.

It's nice but don't ask for too much.  Get it used.",1133308800,3,703,4.110294117647059
737173,2,6303921051,"A title like ""Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity"" is sure to strike absolute terror into the hearts of even the most stalwart B movie fans. Here's a film that sounds like an offbeat 1950's atomic age UFO cheesefest, one of those obnoxiously cheap pictures featuring pie pans on strings bouncing against a poster of the sky as overweight stage hands wearing zipper showing costumes lurch and stumble around in the foreground. Well, before you can say ""take me to your leader,"" let me tell you that ""Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity"" is not an offbeat 1950's atomic age UFO cheesefest featuring pie pans on strings bouncing against a poster of the sky as overweight stage hands wearing zipper showing costumes lurch and stumble around in the foreground. Nope, it's got nothing to do with the 1950s or atomic age UFO scares. Instead, it's an 80's version of ""The Most Dangerous Game."" In ""Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity,"" you see several scantily clad women with huge hair stumbling around a jungle as some guy hunts them down for sport. Sounds great, doesn't it? Not really. In fact, it's quite boring even for fans of this junk. The movie has such a high cheese level that I needed a cholesterol test after watching it.
Two prisoners, Daria (Elizabeth Kaitan) and Tisa (Cindy Beal), find themselves in quite a predicament. Locked away in a cage on a transport barge, the two must discover some way to escape before the overlords of the ship sell them into slavery. One of the girls figures out how to break their chains-must have studied physics in high school-and the two overpower their guards and escape in a smaller spaceship. Adrift in deep space, Daria and Tisa worry whether they will ever find a civilized planet on which to land. Just when the situation looks bleak, the ship picks up a signal from a nearby planet. The ship crash-lands on the planet and the two are briefly separated. They reunite at a medieval looking castle in the middle of a jungle owned by a man named Zed (Don Scribner). This guy, who has two robot helpers, already plays host for two other crash survivors-Shela (Brinke Stevens) and Rik (Carl Horner). Daria and Tisa soon learn that Zed is a little odd, that he likes to spend his time playing weird holographic musical instruments, hosting lavish dinners, and hunting. Especially hunting. Zed's huge basement is loaded with trophies celebrating his excursions into the jungle.
Our heroines soon discover that Zed likes to hunt humans instead of animals. He draws wayfarers to the planet only so he can turn them loose in the jungle and, using his robots as hounds, flush them into the open to finish them off. Daria and Tisa, along with Rik and Shela, will soon form the next contingent for a new hunting expedition. In the meantime, the girls discover what Zed is up to and attempt to escape. No good. Zed is determined to hunt, so after recapturing the cuties he cuts them loose with a few weapons and instructions about how to play the game. It's to the credit of our heroines that they aren't willing to just lie down and accept their fate. They truly fight to stay alive despite the traps, the slanted odds of the game, and the dangerous wildlife in the jungle. There's the noble sacrifice, the discovery of a strange alien structure, and the usual table turning moment. You can probably guess how this one ends. If not, you ought to. So many other films have ripped this idea off that you have definitely seen some version of the story at some point in your life.
I incorrectly labeled ""Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity"" as a B movie, and it is, but I should make a distinction between the special effects (certainly B budget) and the acting, dialogue, and pacing. The latter is pure Z grade schlock, with the characters tossing off brain deadening dialogue and one-liners even as they prance around in bikinis and lingerie. Where did they get these clothes, anyway? Zed lives in a huge castle with everything he could want. Couldn't he at least have the decency to find a pair of pants for these gals? Actually, the skimpy outfits make the film somewhat impressive. How much cooler is it for a couple of woman to stand up to two robots and a heavily armed man in a bikini than wearing shirts, pants, and shoes? Anyway, the pacing of the film positively drags even though the movie only runs for seventy some minutes. The acting, too, is the pits. It's a sad commentary on the state of cinema when you watch a movie like this one and recognize that the robots turned in the best performances. Still, discerning viewers can distill a few interesting things about the future by watching the movie. For example, at some point when spaceships exist, the fashion trends and hairstyles of the 1980's will make a comeback. I kept expecting that guy from A Flock of Seagulls to step out of the shadows like some bizarrely coiffed Rod Serling clone, telling us the movie an illusion.
Extras on the DVD version, if memory serves me correctly, consisted of several trailers for cheese classics like ""The Creepozoids."" I can't really recommend this film to anyone. It's too corny for science fiction fans, too non-horror for the horror crowd, and too foolhardy for lovers of tongue in cheek comedy. Even viewers looking for girls walking around in next to nothing might be disappointed. The image of beauty has obviously changed quite a bit between 1987 and now. These girls will probably do nothing to raise the pulse of today's young male audiences. Give it a shot if you just have to see it. Others, stay light years away.",1086652800,14,5553,4.690573770491803
737174,3,6303921051,"This is nothing more than 'The Most Dangerous Game' meets the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders on the set of 'Space 1999'. I expected high camp value out of a film with a title like this, and there is a degree of campiness present, but overall it is bland. The 'outer space' dialogue is often hilarious, and the acting itself is wooden and unsubtle, just like you would expect.
This is almost literally an exact remake of 'The Most Dangerous Game', with a few added mutants and bickering androids for good measure. There is actually not much nudity, and what little bit there is not what you would call titillating. This should have been a more upbeat, fun camp classic, but it tried to be too many things. Notably the director attempts to make it genuinely scary and suspenseful during the hunting scenes, but given the silly nature of the material they are working with, the end product never seems to quite click as a movie.
I have seen funny and campy sci-fi, which I like, and I have seen scary sci-fi, which I also like. Unfortunately this movie presses a little too hard to be both, and it comes up a bit short in the end.",1078876800,42,1124,4.487804878048781
