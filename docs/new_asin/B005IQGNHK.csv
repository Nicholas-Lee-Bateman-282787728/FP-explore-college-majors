4709731,2,B005IQGNHK,Kind of sappy portrayal of crimes and victims.  The imaginary dialogue from the dead throughout the investigation detracts from the forensic aspect of the video.,1402876800,2,161,5.44
4709732,5,B005IQGNHK,"I enjoyed all of the episodes in this true crime series.  I would have liked them better if they had not included narration by the dead victims; such content is speculative or hearsay that was added for entertainment purposes only, if murder and death can be considered entertainment.  However, all episodes were presented in a professional format, and contained the relevant facts about each case.  I would recommend the series to any amateur sleuth who enjoys an interesting mystery.",1388275200,2,485,5.113924050632911

4709736,5,B005IQGNHK,"We hear often hear int the media about these types of stories where someone becomes obsessed with another person with often deadly intent.

8474940,3,B005IQGNHK,"We love true crime stories! Reenactments of murders and other crimes that really happened. Telling the story of the where when who and especially the how and why! We can't get enough! While the stories portrayed in this series are good, the show itself tends to be very slow and repetitive. I think ten minutes every show is dedicated to repeating parts already said. If they would pick the pace up a bit, and stop repeating things it would be a much better series and would receive 5 stars from me. Until then I stand by 3.",1459382400,,524,4.412371134020619
8474941,5,B005IQGNHK,"This volume has four episodes of ""Stolen Voices, Buried Secrets"" that are especially emotional because the stories are narrated as if in the voice of the victims.  This is very effective because you feel as if you are getting to hear about the crimes from the victims' perspective.

There are also three episodes of ""Wicked Attractions"" which cover some brutal crimes that occurred because a deadly combination of persons got together.",1451865600,,435,5.112676056338028
