7533554,3,B017SZC2U0,Sunset Song w/Agyness Deyn - This film is a love story/tragedy/family dysfunctions all rolled into one.  It is set in Ireland just before WWII and runs into the war toward the end.  It's a story about a woman and a family and how she deals with all of the above.,1472774400,2,262,4.22
7533555,4,B017SZC2U0,"I'm always terrified to hear a film is ""long anticipated"" or that it was ""years in the making,"" lest the weight of anticipation and expectation crush the work that emerges.

Terence Davies' long-awaited Scottish saga Sunset Song, which was first conceived in 2000, bears the weight just fine, thanks.

One of the finest directors to emerge from Britain since David Lean and Michael Powell, Davies, 70, has specialized in achingly poetic, deeply intimate semiautobiographical period pieces set in England during the 1940s and 1950s, including Distant Voices, Still Lives, The Long Day Closes, and The Deep Blue Sea.

Sunset Song finds him exploring a different time and place. Adapted from Scottish modernist Lewis Grassic Gibbon's 1932 novel, it's a coming-of-age story about a young girl from rural Scotland in the years leading up to World War I.

Like Davies' best work, the movie employs classical rigor - perfectly symmetrical, painterly landscapes and interiors - with unexpected postmodern touches.

Sunset Song opens on a field of wheat as flaxen as any in cinema, a paean to sunshine and its life-conferring power. The wind makes the dry sea of gold crackle in waves.

It's a classic image.

But not quite: The wheat extends up a hillside, and as we track up the gradient, the camera gently surveying the field, suddenly up pops a young woman.

She asserts her unique presence in the landscape as if to introduce herself, ""Hi, I'm Chris Guthrie, the film's heroine.""

Played by singer-model Agyness Deyn, Chris doesn't actually speak in that scene - though in later scenes she'll look directly at the camera in a brazen breach of classic film protocol. Sunset Song is narrated by Chris in the third person, as if she were speaking about someone else, another postmodern touch.

At its heart, the movie is a tale about the tug-of-war between modernity and tradition. Chris is one of six children born to a poor farming family, with a doting but brutal father (Peter Mullan) and a tyrannized mother (Daniela Nardini).

She works hard at school, hoping her superior intellect will allow her to escape. At the same time, she feels deeply rooted in the place of her birth. The smell of the soil brings tears to her eyes.

Deyn is new to acting, with few credits aside from a memorable turn as Richard Coyle's crafty lover in Pusher. She acquits herself well.

She has an endlessly fascinating face, which cinematographer Michael McDonough (Winter's Bone) exploits sparingly in beautiful close-ups at just the right points in the drama.

Davies' film shifts gears as we enter Chris' adult life. She doesn't land at university, but marries a sweet farmer named Ewan (Kevin Guthrie) and finds herself sucked into motherhood, like her own mother before her. Ewan gets sent to the Western Front.

Sunset Song will feel flat for folks expecting grand, dramatic scenes, long speeches about love, fraught conflicts, or psychological insights. Like Terrence Malick's early work - one thinks especially of Days of Heaven - Davies' film is heavy on painterly visuals and atmosphere.

Chris' voice-overs offer a bit of linguistic help. But Davies is almost bullheaded in his dedication to giving us a visual work - even though his film is based on a book that's renowned for its rich use of language.

I love Davies' attempt to re-create Sunset Song as a cinematic work instead of just subjecting it to a Masterpiece Theater adaptation.

Not everyone is liable to agree. Davies will disappoint, if not anger, some of Gibbon's fans. And they are legion: In a 2005 poll, Scottish adults overwhelmingly picked Gibbon's novel as their favorite.",1472515200,,3632,4.985099337748345
7533556,4,B017SZC2U0,"You've got to take into account that I'm biased towards period drama and I haven't read the novel on which this film is based. Apparently, the filmmakers had to shrink a fictional tome into a mere 2 hrs. of film-story, which takes the protagonist, Chris, from girlhood to the end of the beginning of womanhood.

(spoiler alert*) The film is beautifully shot, (presumably) historically accurate in it's domestic details, but psychologically weird in it's scene jumps.
The first half of the film seems emotionally accurate, albeit somewhat shallow in it's depiction of the impact of being targeted for incest by a terrifyingly narcissistic parent.

However, the most important lapse in the story is the lack of foreshadowing to explain why Chris's besotted, gentle husband returns on leave from WW1 as a devilishly rapey, bullying monster possessed by total self-centeredness.  Of course, war changes it's participants, but this leap from kindly shepherd into massive narco-viciousness is well beyond actual PTSD, (and with only the tiniest measure of foreshadowing). When the film gets to that dramatic crux, (about 3/4s of the way in) it simply makes no sense.

So, (to sum up) it's a very worthy effort, with an intensely interesting subject, and it's also very beautifully filmed. However,it loses one star for being a bit weak in it's depiction of actual human psychological reality.",1472515200,17,1386,5.201793721973094

7533559,4,B017SZC2U0,"I recall a TV version of this same novel long ago but anyway ... this is a typical UK period piece set in Scotland in the early 20th century. The props, period dress and settings are impeccable. The cinematography is fine as is the character development. The soundtrack is appropriate to the era.

The lead is Agyness Deyn (alias Laura Hollins), a tall English model trying her hand at acting. I found her performance to be a seven out of ten as she did well enough but sometimes struggled to emote at appropriate times. The rest of the cast was fine and provided good support.

This film is basically a bit idyllic punctuated by some disturbingly violent moments but overall it is a moderate Greek tragedy ending with what one hopes is a better outlook for the life of the lead character. There's virtually no special effects nor a lot of action bling so one must like human interest stories to enjoy this film. I do and gave it a soft four stars.",1471996800,,948,4.473988439306359
7533560,4,B017SZC2U0,"""Sunset Song"" (2015 release from the UK; 135 min.; full title as shown: "" Lewis Grassic Gibbon's Sunset Song"") brings the story of Chris Guthrie. As the movie opens, Chris is in school, where she and her classmates are struggling in a French language class. Soon afterwards, we get to know her family, including her beloved mum and her grumpy dad. Much to everyone's surprise, it turns out that mum is pregnant again, despite her relative advanced age. Meanwhile Chris' brother Will pines to move away from home. sick and tired from being bosses around by grumpy dad. At this point we are a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is not the first (nor likely the last) movie adaptation of one of Scotland's most beloved and important novels in the last 100 years. Here British director Terence Davies (The Deep Blue See; The House of Mirth) adopts the book. While I had heard of the book, I have not read it, so I was a blank sheet going into the theater and did not know what to expect. What you can expect is this: a slow-moving (and I mean that as a compliment) epic film that brings the story of one women's struggle for independence in the early 1910a in Scotland. At some point in the movie, it dawned on me that the parallels with ""Gone With the Wind"", in a Scottish setting and 50 years later, are uncanny: Chris being of course Scarlett, her beloved Blawearie is Tara, and WWI is the equivalent of the civil war. ""Nothing endures but the land!"" A quote from Scarlett in GWTW? No, it's from Chris in ""Sunset Song"". The photography is eye-candy from start to finish (filmed on location in Scotland and also in New Zealand). British model Agyness Deyn, reminding me of a younger Nicole Kidman) plays Chris, in the role of a life time. ""The bonniest lass in all of Blawearie"" exclaims a guy at one point, and that she surely is/ Every little detail in the costumes and overall production seems to be perfect, Beware: the dialogue is in all-out Scottish, reason why the movie was shown with English subtitles. ""Aye"" is probably the most frequently used word in the dialogue. And you get sentences like ""the wind's up for a fine frost"", whatever that means!

""Sunset Song"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last Fall. Not sure why it's taken this long, but the movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprise. Who knew there was demand for a film like this? If you are in the mood for an epic family-and-war drama that has a heavy Scottish accent to boot, you cannot go wrong with this. Given the epic scenery, best enjoyed on the big screen, if at all possible. ""Sunset Song"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1469232000,13,2890,4.555769230769231
7533561,5,B017SZC2U0,"Terence Davies is one of the finest directors currently working right now.  The interweaving of the discourse over a numbers of years, the pacing, the deft transitioning of scenes, the juxtaposition of a brutal story embedded in deep and primal conflict with the sumptuous cinematography of a Scottish countryside which has never looked better on film are masterful.  The hand of a master is at work here.",1464134400,4,405,5.029850746268656
7533562,4,B017SZC2U0,"The United Kingdom submitted this entry to the 2016 Seattle International Film Festival. This highly acclaimed film takes place in Scotland and yes! It has closed captions. Writer/director Terence Davies (""House of Mirth"") based his screenplay on Lewis Grassic Gibbon's 1932 novel by the same name.

With a muted canvas and notably long single-take, highly emotional scenes, we look at six years in the life of a peasant farm family before and just after the carnage of World War I. Life was hard, particularly for the women, who had no control over their lives.

Cast:
  * Agyness Deyn (""Hail, Caesar!"") is Chris Guthrie, a studious young woman who wants to become a school teacher. Her father is a despot, her mother is a slave and her life doesn't turn out like she expects. This actress does a spectacular job!
  * Peter Mullan (""Olive Kitteridge"") is her father John Guthrie. He never allows anyone to question his authority, he just wields it! Any time he is on screen, we hold our breath because we know he can be arbitrary and cruel with no warning.
  * Kevin Guthrie (Lots of TV) Ewan Tavendale falls for Chris the moment he lays eyes on her. World War I upsets their idyllic life together.
  * Jack Greenlees (""Penny Dreadful"") is her brother Will. Even as a grown man, he still yields to his father's authority and submits to a whipping on command.

The period detail is impressive: the clothes they wear, the interior of the house, and the tools they use, are all authentic. The pace is glacial, but I don't think I would want it any other way. I had a big problem with the wheat field though. In every scene, regardless of what time of year is depicted, the wheat is ripe, fully bearded, and ready for harvest. Aarghhh! (I know, picky picky.)

Chris is an exceptional intelligent person whose life would appear to be wasted by modern standards. However, she doesn't realize this as life forces her to endure leaving little time for huge dreams...like going to Canada. The film is in the realm of art house which accounts for all the acclaim. No one can bad mouth an arty film without looking oafish. This one incorporates metaphoric language in narration, ""dark quiet corpse [books] that was her childhood was fulfilled in the tissue paper and laid away forever.""

Chris discovers that as life passes, nothing endues but the land. I thought it was better said (and you can dance to it) by the grand philosopher  Stevie Wonder, ""Living Just Enough for the City"" but then again I am a bit oafish.

If bitter-sweet art house historical tales your cup of tea...this is it.

The Dad likes to be in control, and that means trouble for the oldest son who runs away. That's the first 25-30 minutes. As the story goes on you realize she has no concept of the outer world. Lots of staring with tears welling up in her eyes. With no thought rattling around the cranium other than landscape images or followed by her open mouth reaction to other people's  angst, action and truth. I was beginning to understand when her ex GI husband comes back from the front why he abused her and then he runs off only to get shot dead by firing squad. Apparently, the only one in proximity to her with a clue is killed because he wanted to get back to make sure she didn't continue to be an idiot. Jokes on him, because she's a wealthy landowner.

This film did not and failed to do justice to a great piece of Scottish Literature.  The beautiful scenery is there, the atmosphere rife for the story, but it just did not grab me.  I blame the director, Terence Davies. First, Deyn is a fair actress, but not quite complex enough for this story. Second, the casting of Euan seemed a bit off and it was hard to grasp what exactly it was in him that caused Chris Guthrie to overturn her independence and freedom to him in marriage. No chemistry, just a brief flash of the eyes. Many scenes seem to be done in the style of a play as characters arrived into her home as though entering stage left (""Chae enters stage left, walking slowly."").  Many scenes were way overlong, (Chris wailing for her husband and wailing and wailing, panning shots of a WWI battlefield) taking away from time that could have been spent developing character. There wasn't the time for many aspects of the tale but this overdoing of some scenes ultimately led to the exclusion Chris's relationship with Long Rob, who represented the man who was pacifist even onto prison and a turning point for Chris as a woman. This story is not only of a girl coming of age, but a nation in change as it left off the agrarian society and industrialized. But the film was only a thin slice of that life.

He has made a few films based on novels or plays (House of Mirth, The Deep Blue Sea and Sunset Song) and the other (Distant Voices, Still Lives; The Long Day Closes)where he combines rapturous lyricism and brutal reality autobiographically. He is close to the heartache and joy of his female characters, and hes good on tyrannical patriarchs, who terrorise their families. What is astounding is that he takes this classic of Scottish literature (part 1 of Lewis Grassic Gibbons Scots Quair trilogy), a project hes been harbouring for 14 years, due to funding/location/time problems, and shoots it in 3 different locations ( New Zealand, Scotland and Belgium). The appeal of the story is in the narrative of different generations of a rural Scottish farming family set in the north east area of Scotland( The Mearns, south of Aberdeen). The novel itself is written in a version of the Doric dialect, and its central character Chris Guthrie, here played by Agyness Deyn, as we witness her transition ( 1910) from bright schoolgirl with a future of education ahead of her, to a married woman with a child. She has deep-rooted feelings for the land, and shes often shown lying in a cornfield, gazing out at the horizon or working with her family harvesting the crop, or harnessing or tending  the animals.

There are scenes reminiscent of Far from the Madding Crowd and Tess, rooted in the landscape and rural culture (with the singing of folk songs, ballads and tunes at harvest time or wedding). Peter Mullan as John Guthrie, acts the stern,violent puritan of the church who, angry and demanding for sex, makes his hard-pressed wife, Jena( Daniella Nardini) pregnant one too many times. Chriss hopes for an education become sacrificed as her father drives the family apart, her brother after too many beatings, migrates to Canada. After the death of Chriss mother, her father has a stroke, and enduring his gruesome death frees her to marry a local farmer Ewan Tavendale ( Kevin Guthrie). The film is shot in 65 mm cameras outdoors, which enriches the epic landscape and seasonal changes. DP McDonough( Winters Bone) creates some rapturous pictures of crops, blue skies and clouds. Agyness Deyn is central to the films success, as we watch through her eyes the story unfold. She is an observant, sensitive person, but she has the boyish slenderness of somebody used to the toughness of doing farm work. Her acting captures Chriss intense passion for life and the land, the conflict between her intellect and body. Interiors of family groupings are where most of the drama takes place, shot in digital film. You get the sense of the wind blowing down the chimney and the darker ill-lit interiors.

The second part of the film is based on the years leading up to the 1st world war. Ewan like his other work colleagues are branded cowards for not joining up and are sent white feathers. The Church leads in this indoctrination of the need to fight. He enlists. Davies makes a transition here in the personality of Ewan that is too jolting, who becomes a version of her father, resentful, nasty and bullying, forcing her to have sex, on his return from the training camp before going to war. We later get news of his death and Chriss rage at the loss. Pictures of his final hours and the cameras pan over No Mans land. So, this part of the film is too jerky to work well and seems rushed. The best part of the film is the central part where the young married couple realize their love with each other, the joy of youth, sex and childbirth. If this drives you back to read the book or see the original BBC
TV series(1971) then it will have done its job.",1491264000,,3731,4.728110599078341

8740573,2,B017SZC2U0,I found it very depressing and not a feel good movie at all. It is complex with father/daughter and husband /wife relationships and quite sad. The scenery is beautiful and only positive for me!!!,1484006400,,195,4.764705882352941
