3060049,5,B00114UUL8,"As it happens it's almost to the day one year from the first time that I was able to give this show a full viewing; and I must say that my opinion of it has grown all the fonder for the time. The characters are wonderful and truly flushed out and realized here. The plot is well organized and the general balance of what ""we're"" fighting for really struck home with this viewer. I'm glad I was able to purchase this show in it's entirety like this; as this release (To my knowledge) represents the first time this wonderful story has been available in both it's English and native Japanese as a two part set. An event I have awaited ever since the finale of episode 50 nearly one year ago in 2008.

  Specific points of interest:
0) Both the native Japanese and English Audio Tracks
0) A Wonderful case layout that is sleek and attractive
0) Strong story that works perfectly with its creative environment

In closing I'll simply say it's my all time favorite story told through the eyes of a youth I'd have easily believed was Me, My Brother or even you.",1247270400,,1055,4.394871794871795
3060050,5,B00114UUL8,"If you have never seen Eureka 7 you need to see it, period.  If you are a fan of Evangelion, you need to see it, period. If you love crazy mecha action, you need to see it, period.

I'm not kidding.  This show has me thinking . . . . dare I even say it. . . that it is even better than my beloved Evangelion.  I never thought there would be anything that could ever come along that would make me even suffer a fleeting thought like that but with Eureka 7, my mind has been flooded with that realization. . . . Eureka 7 may be the greatest anime series of all-time.

Now it has to be said, there are a lot of similarities between Eva and Eureka 7, and you can tell that BONES was highly influenced when creating this story by the classic Angel series. How only the ""chosen"" can pilot the Nirvash (just like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd child in Eva) and there seems at least at the beginning to be another alien race that wants to destroy mankind (like the Angels in Eva) and that the subject of rebirth for mankind (the Third Impact).  But Eureka 7 seems to run with these themes and tie them all together with one of the most heart-wrenching love stories I have ever seen.  Pure brilliance.

And I have to say that I have watched the series both with the Eng subtitles and with the Eng dub and I have to say the English translation on the dub is great and perhaps delivers an even more moving performance from the voice actors.

I have never teared up more at an anime.  Weird.  What always got to me was during the English dub at the end of every episode Renton and Eureka would both say in unison ""To be continued. . ."" but in a way and tone that reflects how the episode ends emotionally.  At the end of many episodes they sounded happy, chipper, excited, relieved, worried. . . it really let you know how the characters were feeling.

But what really got to me was the end of episode 47 I think.  They had such a sound of hopelessness in their voices like everything was done. . . and then at the end of episode 49 . . . there was only Renton uttering those words.  I have never been more emotionally invested in the characters of an anime series in my life and it may be because they reel you in with 50 episodes!

Buy this show.",1247270400,53,2227,4.12037037037037
3060051,5,B00114UUL8,"First of all i would like to state how much of a deal this is. $36 for half of the complete series, that is a deal. Not to mention that all the discs have some pretty sick decals on them.

I actually got this item the day it came out, so the shipping is pretty good. When i got it i was quite surprised that it gave you the option to watch in dubbed because it does not mention that in the details.
 I watched all the discs and there is no errors or flaws. If your an E7 fan buy this.",1246838400,6,484,3.735294117647059
3060052,3,B00114UUL8,"Considering the fact that you'd have to spend over $300 to get the entire series on DVD (no box sets yet) and [adultswim] doesn't show it anymore, I was thrilled to see it offered on Unbox. $1.99 per episode is about right (it was originally $5.99 per episode when offered directly through Bandai [?]). I'd probably be willing to buy the entire series from Amazon Unbox, if it weren't for the audio sync issue. I'm glad I downloaded the first episode to introduce people to it, but I don't know how many other episodes have issues. Too bad, because this is a great way to get anime not offered on iTunes. I'd go so far as to say this is the future of anime, with the exception of speedbumps like the dub track on this version. Hope they fix it.",1214006400,,744,4.321428571428571
3060053,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka Seven is one of the most remarkable coming-of-age sagas in any medium.

Renton Thurston's painful journey from bratty teenager to confident young man is brilliantly told in the format of a rousing adventure story and a highly unusual romance.  Just who *is* the pale, quiet girl whose only name is ""Eureka?""  Renton's odyssey to find out leads him across the world and beyond in the most remarkable anime series I've ever seen.

Eureka Seven's unique world is slowly revealed as Renton impulsively joins Gekkostate, the highly individualistic crew of the renegade airship Gekko-go.  But only gradually does he come to realize that Gekkostate is much more than a band of eccentric pirates.  As they run from their own shocking past toward a future in which the existence of the entire planet is on the line, Renton is forced to grow up fast -- and bring Eureka along with him -- if humanity is to survive.

If you're new to anime, Eureka Seven can hardly be surpassed as an introduction to the best of the genre.  And even if you're already an anime fan, you won't find better writing or more subtle plotting, or a more richly-detailed background for a powerful story, than this.  But be warned, when it's over you'll be saying that fifty episodes isn't nearly enough.  Highest recommendation.",1209427200,8,1299,4.83710407239819
3060054,5,B00114UUL8,"This was an amazing conclusion to a very well done series. It managed to keep things changing and unexpected, all while presenting a well told and dynamic conclusion to the story and avoiding significant cliches. Everything introduced throughout the series 50 episode run comes together to present this concrete and satisfying conclusion that manages to avoid making things feel to fairy tale or textbook, but still doesn't fall in to the trap of overdoing it or making things too ambiguous and leaving a lot of loose ends.

This series is a character drama, and as such that is the real focus of the finale. The conflict and how it presents itself plays a significant factor, no doubt about it, but Renton and Eureka are the true focus and in that regard they pull it off perfectly. It's a roller coaster ride with a lot of ups and downs, times that feel like all is lost and times you can't help but cheer at the screen. On top of that, a lot of things are explained in this volume regarding the story and the world the series takes place on.

All in all it's a magnificent conclusion that doesn't disappoint. I find that usually is the biggest problem I encounter with anime is that the conclusions tend to be disappointing. I'm very happy that Eureka Seven, one of my favorite series, did not encounter this problem. This is especially relieving considering I read the manga through and was disappointed by how it was concluded.

This is a special edition, so it comes with a shirt like the others. In this case we get a light green shirt in size large with the military's logos printed on the upper front and upper back of the shirt. It also comes with the 2nd, and last, volume of the 2nd manga series; ""Gravity Boys & Lifting Girl"", which isn't bad, but it doesn't relate to the events in the series much at all. Another soundtrack is also provided with the full versions of all the intro and closing songs in the series, and for the game as well. It also has the final song of the series, though that was also provided as a full version in the second OST with volume 7.",1209254400,4,2077,4.474934036939314
3060055,5,B00114UUL8,"this is one series you hope thier is a OVA.it never lost track on what they wanted to show in the series.that is of coarse to show how both Renton and Euerka grew. It ended on a happy note,so that it good.the only proplem I had with it, was it did not show what happen to the grew of the Gekko state.not a huge deal I think, but it would have been nice if they did. If like Anime,this is a series for you:) enjoy!!",1208304000,3,414,3.8823529411764706
3060056,5,B00114UUL8,"By Far the best anime I've seen!!!!!!!, the story was superb, the twists and it left you in tears near the end, forcing you to chew on your keyboard/Remote from the Suspense! you will love it !!!

The last 10 episodes were just magnificent and I cant even count the amount of times I was on the verge of tears (ep 45 especially) While the show was slow to start none of those episodes were wasted. The quality of the character development for Eureka and Renton is just staggering, even the kids in the final eps. I haven't been as pleased with a show as this in such a long time, and I really think it represents the absolute best in anime. Great story, fantastic characters, great writing etc. This seriously is the type of series where the word ""timeless"" comes to mind.",1207872000,12,772,4.398601398601398

3060069,2,B00114UUL8,"Not a bad series to watch. I started to get interested with this proposed coming of age story about Renton who falls for a not quite human, Eureka, who pilots a mecha, Nirvash. Turns out Eureka has adopted 3 kids. Renton and Eureka, under the age of 16 or 15, try to take care of 3 spoiled kids while fighting a war and serving aboard the Gekkostate. Too many times does the show center around the kids and their emotions that at times it drags on. There is a somewhat decent scifi mecha storyline and the supporting cast saves the series from being too childish. Clearly this show is intended more for children than adults.
There are so many emotional breakdowns throughout the series from Renton, Eureka, and her adopted kids that it gets exhausting (I can't begin to fathom how the voice actors could keep it up).",1397088000,2,816,4.52027027027027
3060070,5,B00114UUL8,"This definitely is my favorite anime of all time, up there with samurai champloo, fma, and others.

3060072,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka Seven. Possibly one of if not the greatest anime series I've ever seen. It's definitely my favorite.
About this release; for those of you that don't own the series but want to, DO NOT buy these sets for their outrageous prices! Why? Because, in case you didn't know already, Funimation has recently licensed Eureka Seven, and is planning to re-release it next year (2014) on DVD AND Blu-ray as well, for reasonable prices. So anyone wanting to own the series just be patient, and you'll be able to get it. It makes since this happened anyway. I mean, many fans of this anime along with myself hoped it would come to this, and we knew the day would come eventually, since they did license the sequel, Eureka Seven AO. But yeah, that's my advice to you, wait for the Funimation release. That's what I'm doing.

3060073,4,B00114UUL8,"As many if you reading this may know, to own this Eureka 7 collection just a few months earlier would mean spending over $500. So, naturally, I ordered both collections without a second glance once they dropped in price.

This show... I have seen many anime. Many, many anime--but this still remains at the top for me. There's just something special about this one... About the characters and their development, about the uniqueness of the world that it takes place in, about the artwork and animation and the soundtrack that that really adds a that final topping of awesomeness as you see these giant, humanoid LFOs reffing on the trappars.

The show itself is definitely a 5/5, but I was unhappy to see that EVERY disc in this new, unopened collection had small scuffs and scratches, a couple of them even had more severe wounds and I wondered if it would play the episodes properly. Luckily, nothing is wrong with it on a technical level.

I give this purchase a 4/5 just because the product wasn't in as prestine condition as I was hoping one of the hard-to-come-by anime greats would be.",1386892800,2,1092,4.677083333333333

3060075,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka Seven is by far one of my favorite series, and this DVD collection captures all of it, partly because they needed to or else the discs would of been blank. The extras are beyond worth it in my opinion since most DVDs from Anime Legends tend to vary on what they give you. This however gives you just enough to be contempt making the purchase. I appreciate that the price is still as low as it is and that people haven't been to greedy to charge $100 for the set. I feel bad for anyone who puts down that much for an experience that should be more readily accessible for enjoyment. None of the DVDs skipped terribly for me, and hopefully won't for you. Please do yourself a favor and by a copy before some neckbeard otaku looking to make quick cash off you jacks the price to +$100.",1378339200,,788,4.26

I rewatched the series and thought it would be nice to see if there was a second season, to my surprise I found all the disc's for the second series to complete the story line. The disc were cheap on cost but the 11th Vol was pricey, so I shelled out the clams to complete the set. Good part was the 11th Vol came with a tee shirt and a box to house the other disc's.

Their destiny is determined over the course of the series.

The dvd set is perfect, easy to use menus, audio/sub options, and amazing extras! Voice actor interviews (English and Japanese VAs). There's also audio commentary for 1 episode per disc with the Japanese VAs who are absolutely entertaining and funny.",1357776000,3,704,4.858333333333333

I know that Johnny Yong Bosch does his voice, he just changes it to make Renton seem like a whining brat. He is a whining brat a lot of the time though. He does a much better voice acting job in anime like Please Twins and Bleach.

I like this series very much. There is a lot of action and plenty of drama. The story is very involved too. It's a must see for any serious anime fan.",1350086400,,556,4.148148148148148

3060106,5,B00114UUL8,"I remember the first time I watched Evangelion, I was blown away... I've been searching around for an anime to rival the caliber of my favorites, EVA, Death Note, FMA:B... But  none has really drawn me in like they did- until this.

As others have stated, there seem to be EVA influences in E7. But besides them, E7 is it's own animal completely. It's a different style (for lack of a better word) than EVA. Honestly, the love story in E7 is far more interesting than EVA. Whereas Rei never seems to find sanity and always seems... distant... (SPOILER) **you get to enjoy witnessing Eureka finally realize she loves Renton. I was biting my nails in frustration and anticipation for them to finally embrace.

Anyways, this isn't as good as the EVA movies (1.11, 2.22), though it's far better than the Neon Genesis series. The voice acting in EVA:NG was HORRIBLE! Thank gawd that it vastly improved with the recent remakes. I still love the moment when Shinji finds his inner badass at the end of 2.22. But... as a whole, E7 is just more fluid.

If you want my opinion, E7 is up there:

EVA: Neon Genesis < Eureka Seven < Evangelion 1.11/2.22

If you haven't seen this series and love Mecha-Anime, buy it... Now!",1327708800,3,1210,4.578703703703703
3060107,4,B00114UUL8,"Won't argue its not good. Really I enjoyed the show. It is a very unique world and very enjoyable in style and presentation. Surfing mecha was something I hadn't considered before, let alone sky surfing mecha. The characters along with this are all quite enjoyable.

I will however give the series a thumb down for getting inspiration from Evangelion. I get it that EVA was an epic anime which defined a generation. But frankly, not everyone likes EVA or sitting through a psychotherapy session with a character that never seems to learn anything. This happens in the story very strongly with Renton. It gets to the point you just want to strangle the little brat. I get his anguish, really I do. But enough, time to move the story along. Thankfully E7 does, unlike EVA which even in the end never gets beyond psychosis.

The other thumb down would be involving the structure and storytelling of the second half. It is considerably weak. The backstory that sounded so epic as it was built up, seems to disappear when you find out what is really going on. What the lifeforms are and the scenes following that are quite anti climactic. Then as it finally comes to completion it leaves you mildly satisfied with a lot of questions and not enough answers.

Really its a great show, enjoy it for what it does right. But enough with the EVA love already. How much something copies or doesn't copy EVA should not be a standard of if it is good or not. Seeing a protagonist hero being presented as a human through anguish is one thing, but not moving past that and not finally learning how to cope just turns a show from a great piece, into little more watching a kid cower and whine over and over.",1309651200,,1690,4.534426229508196
3060138,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka seven is a great anime title, one of the best ever, but this is a product review.

First off the packing is very nice, the art on the discs is amazing, I was stunned just seeing the disc in the case, the video and audio quality...Its the best i have ever seen.  It is so beautiful, the colors pop out so well...You just have to own this, it looks so good.",1301443200,,362,4.013888888888889
3060139,5,B00114UUL8,I am very satisified with this transaction. It arrived promptly when it was supposed to and in excellent condition. I have used amazons services many times and I will continue to for the forseable future.,1300838400,,204,4.857142857142857
3060140,5,B00114UUL8,"If you're looking at this I'm sure you've already seen the rave reviews for this series elsewhere, so I'll briefly add my two cents that this is indeed the single best science fiction series ever, animated or otherwise.

Volume 2 (don't forget to buy volume 2 as well) concludes the series with the same perfection you are soon to experience in this first half of the series. By the time the series ends, ""Eureka seveN"", unlike so many other series, not only answers every question you may have had and delivers several ""Holy crap!"" surprises, it actually has a very good, very satisfying ending.

I'm a very nit-picky person when it comes to my entertainment, but other than breathing at high altitudes and at tremendous speeds without some kind of air mask and and never changing their clothes despite several scenes where the female cast go shopping, there is not one scene, not one word of dialogue, which I can complain about. ""Eureka seveN"" is not only a fantastic and original science fiction story, it is impeccably well told from start to finish. Like ""Cowboy Bebop"", it's the kind of showpiece you can lend to your anim hating friends to show them than anim has come a long way since ""Robotech"" and ""Captain Harlock"" that they watched on TV when they were little.

Nice menus, good quality video and audio, and the English voice acting is as good as the original Japanese cast (yes it is, purists -- accept it) and I'd go so far as to say it's better because having Renton (the main character) voiced by a boy instead of a woman sounds a lot more convincing. Subtitle options include the now standard (for the most part) of well translated full subtitles or translations for Japanese words that appear in scenes only. Also, the opening and ending songs include both English translations and romaji for those who enjoy singing along.

My only disappointment is that the audio wasn't remastered into surround sound, but otherwise this collection is proof that Bandai finally ""gets it"" and has stopped buying properties to just dump cheap English dubs on us.

The extra's are a bit dry and the limited number of trailers for other series is disappointing as is having the first two openings and endings appearing textless only once each, but it's a far cry from Bandai's past standard of not giving us any extras at all.

All of the commentary (one episode per disc) is ""hosted"" by the Japanese voice actors for Renton and Eureka with one or two of the other cast members as ""guests"", and with few exceptions this is rather like listening to a bunch of friends getting together and talking as they rarely bother to comment on the show itself. The sole exception is when the director ""guests"" and gives insights into some of the symbolism, much to the surprise of the ditsy hosts who clearly thought that this was just another dumb animated series. You'll lose track of the number of times they say with shock and surprise ""...and this aired at 7am on Sunday morning!"" every time a serious scene comes on.

The cast interviews (again, one per disc) with the English and Japanese voice cast is hit or miss (mostly miss) but that's the case with most DVDs; however, I would have preferred interviews with the people responsible for the actual production of this series like the directors and writers as I'd love to hear more about the symbolism, etc., but again, it's better than the nothing Bandai usually gives us.

In conclusion, don't hesitate to buy this series, and specifically, this two volume set of the complete series of ""Eureka seveN"" as this is no cheap bootleg or half-assed production: This is a good quality product.",1300838400,16,3636,4.7239747634069404
3060141,5,B00114UUL8,"I've been conditioned to say ""Cowboy Bebop"" whenever asked what my favorite anime series is, and for good reason: I've been a fan of that series for going on a decade and it was quite a revelation on first viewing. I hadn't seen anything like it before and it really only gets better with repeat viewings.
...but upon purchasing this DVD set and rewatching it for the first time since it left American airwaves I have to acknowledge that Eureka Seven is my favorite anime.

Why? Well, for one thing I suppose it boils down to me being a romantic at heart, and there is a lot of sentimentality going on in Eureka Seven. As a matter of fact, gosh-darn true love is the biggest theme of the series! But that's not to say it's all mushy stuff. In actuality a lot of horrible things happen in the world of Eureka Seven and there's tragedy and brutality to spare. That's what makes the romance, hope, and various other positive emotions also on display mean something: beauty in the face of adversity.

Of course, an assortment of likeable characters, beautiful animation, and a really kickass soundtrack also help!

But let's get to the matter at hand: this DVD set containing the first 26 episodes.

Eureka Seven is one of the few full-year (around 50 episodes) long anime that held my attention all the way through. It's the perfect length: I never felt like there was filler or things were being dragged out. The story is exactly as long as it needs to be, and one of the reasons the 50 episode format works is that each half of the series is very different. To put it bluntly: this DVD set introduces us to the world and the relationships, and we have ample time to explore them both. The second half, which is the next DVD set, plunges this world which we are now emotionally invested in into a hell. Dramatic, no?

To be more specific: Eureka Seven occurs in a far-off future where the human race dwells on a mysterious planet covered in something called ""Scub Coral"" and with the atmosphere full of something called ""Trapar Waves."" The Trapars are cool, because it allows one to do the really uber-cool sport of ""lifting,"" basically surfing in the sky. It also allows the various technologies like robots and flying machines to fly. 14 year old Renton loves to lift, and he idolizes legendary lifter Holland and his counter-culture commune The Gekkostate. When Renton ends up actually meeting The Gekkostate he joins and finds out it isn't as glamorous as he imagined: Holland can be difficult to get along with, the members of the crew all have to work for their keep, and to top it all off they're not so much a group of carefree lifters as a band of government rebels! But in consolation for Renton he meets and falls in love (at first sight) with a  mysterious Gekkostate member his own age, a girl named Eureka who pilots an equally mysterious robot called The Nirvash. Renton's arrival triggers a change in both Eureka and the Nirvash, so Holland makes Renton's Eureka's partner, much to his delight - but he has no real conception of what the real motives of the Gekkostate are, and just what he has got himself into.",1300147200,4,3126,4.573214285714286

3060146,3,B00114UUL8,"I know what some, if not most of you, are thinking... 3 STARS? I have seen the entire series, all the way to its conclusion. I decided to write this review to give a little warning about what could have been one of the best anime mecha shows in the last few years.

Now my review of the rest of the series is why I am writing this today. The first ""season"" of Eureka Seven ( 1-26 ) is an incredible roller coaster ride that will both dazzle you and take you to places you wouldn't have considered before. The second half of the series however is an INCREDIBLE disappointment. What was strong in the first season is weak in the second. Strangely, also some episode budgets must have been cut in the second season as I could see marked difference in quality between episodes. By far some of the worst episodes are in the second half of the show and I cannot begin to tell you how bad they are without possibly spoiling part of the story for you which I am loathe to do. The story potential that was in the first half of Eureka Seven with its mysteries and life lessons are concluded badly and at times forgotten about in the second half, basically meaning the show felt like they were creating the ending as they were releasing episodes. This generally works well in episodic shows but with such buildup, character development, and mystery that was in the first half this does not work here. To be honest if it was not for the first half I doubt I would have been able to finish watching the second, it was that painful to watch at times.

I wrote this review to warn you what will be coming ahead and to say that Eureka Seven is an excellent anime with an unfortunate finish. I am not saying do not watch this show but to just be a little wary of the second half, it could have been so much better.",1252713600,10,1797,4.251461988304094
3060147,5,B00114UUL8,"""Eureka Seven"" is one of the most breathtaking mecha series, even if robot surfing seems a little too cheesy to take seriously.

The sport in this series is called lifting, a form a airboarding. It's all the rage. The main character of ""Eureka Seven,"" 14-year-old Renton Thurston, is hell-bent on become a great lifter, just like his idol, Holland Novak. But all his plans change when a cute blue-haired girl named Eureka crashes her LFO robot into his home. When enemy LFOs attack her robot, Renton is faced with daunting responsibility of saving the girl he loves.

After the battle in the sky, Renton is greeted by Holland with an offer to come aboard his ship, the Gekkostate. This is an offer that Renton cannot refuse, and the start of his new adventures.

""Eureka Seven"" is a beautiful masterpiece of flashing colors, liquid-smooth fighting animation and romance. Although it opens like a simple romance, it develops into a hard-edged drama of humongous proportions. Gekkostate is at war with the United Federation Force over the fate of the world, and the battles are emotionally shattering.

For starters, Eureka is as emotionally detached as the Evangelion character, Rei Ayanami. She hides the crushing emotional guilt of killing innocent people. And as much as Holland hides the truth, Renton is bound to discover that Eureka is an emotionally depressed girl who is definitely out of this world. Literally.

Eureka and Renton express extreme angst throughout the series, but their relationship is very compassionate. There's plenty of sadness in the middle of this volume of the collection. However, the characters' constant struggle to help each other through the most difficult times is incredibly heartwarming.

""Eureka Seven"" is a series which I can never stop watching. Even when Holland's defensive hold on Eureka tends to overwhelm Gekkostate, Renton is a remarkable character who truly understands what is best for her.

Although the release of the Complete Collection  of Eureka Seven is far overdue, the drama and power of ""Eureka Seven"" is still unmatched. Get it now, while it's still cheap.",1249171200,2,2115,5.110144927536232
3294546,5,B00114UUL8,"As it happens it's almost to the day one year from the first time that I was able to give this show a full viewing; and I must say that my opinion of it has grown all the fonder for the time. The characters are wonderful and truly flushed out and realized here. The plot is well organized and the general balance of what ""we're"" fighting for really struck home with this viewer. I'm glad I was able to purchase this show in it's entirety like this; as this release (To my knowledge) represents the first time this wonderful story has been available in both it's English and native Japanese as a two part set. An event I have awaited ever since the finale of episode 50 nearly one year ago in 2008.

  Specific points of interest:
0) Both the native Japanese and English Audio Tracks
0) A Wonderful case layout that is sleek and attractive
0) Strong story that works perfectly with its creative environment

In closing I'll simply say it's my all time favorite story told through the eyes of a youth I'd have easily believed was Me, My Brother or even you.",1247270400,,1055,4.394871794871795
3294547,5,B00114UUL8,"If you have never seen Eureka 7 you need to see it, period.  If you are a fan of Evangelion, you need to see it, period. If you love crazy mecha action, you need to see it, period.

I'm not kidding.  This show has me thinking . . . . dare I even say it. . . that it is even better than my beloved Evangelion.  I never thought there would be anything that could ever come along that would make me even suffer a fleeting thought like that but with Eureka 7, my mind has been flooded with that realization. . . . Eureka 7 may be the greatest anime series of all-time.

Now it has to be said, there are a lot of similarities between Eva and Eureka 7, and you can tell that BONES was highly influenced when creating this story by the classic Angel series. How only the ""chosen"" can pilot the Nirvash (just like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd child in Eva) and there seems at least at the beginning to be another alien race that wants to destroy mankind (like the Angels in Eva) and that the subject of rebirth for mankind (the Third Impact).  But Eureka 7 seems to run with these themes and tie them all together with one of the most heart-wrenching love stories I have ever seen.  Pure brilliance.

And I have to say that I have watched the series both with the Eng subtitles and with the Eng dub and I have to say the English translation on the dub is great and perhaps delivers an even more moving performance from the voice actors.

I have never teared up more at an anime.  Weird.  What always got to me was during the English dub at the end of every episode Renton and Eureka would both say in unison ""To be continued. . ."" but in a way and tone that reflects how the episode ends emotionally.  At the end of many episodes they sounded happy, chipper, excited, relieved, worried. . . it really let you know how the characters were feeling.

But what really got to me was the end of episode 47 I think.  They had such a sound of hopelessness in their voices like everything was done. . . and then at the end of episode 49 . . . there was only Renton uttering those words.  I have never been more emotionally invested in the characters of an anime series in my life and it may be because they reel you in with 50 episodes!

I'd probably be willing to buy the entire series from Amazon Unbox, if it weren't for the audio sync issue. I'm glad I downloaded the first episode to introduce people to it, but I don't know how many other episodes have issues. Too bad, because this is a great way to get anime not offered on iTunes. I'd go so far as to say this is the future of anime, with the exception of speedbumps like the dub track on this version. Hope they fix it.",1214006400,,744,4.321428571428571
3294550,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka Seven is one of the most remarkable coming-of-age sagas in any medium.

Renton Thurston's painful journey from bratty teenager to confident young man is brilliantly told in the format of a rousing adventure story and a highly unusual romance.  Just who *is* the pale, quiet girl whose only name is ""Eureka?""  Renton's odyssey to find out leads him across the world and beyond in the most remarkable anime series I've ever seen.

Eureka Seven's unique world is slowly revealed as Renton impulsively joins Gekkostate, the highly individualistic crew of the renegade airship Gekko-go.  But only gradually does he come to realize that Gekkostate is much more than a band of eccentric pirates.  As they run from their own shocking past toward a future in which the existence of the entire planet is on the line, Renton is forced to grow up fast -- and bring Eureka along with him -- if humanity is to survive.

If you're new to anime, Eureka Seven can hardly be surpassed as an introduction to the best of the genre.  And even if you're already an anime fan, you won't find better writing or more subtle plotting, or a more richly-detailed background for a powerful story, than this.  But be warned, when it's over you'll be saying that fifty episodes isn't nearly enough.  Highest recommendation.",1209427200,8,1299,4.83710407239819
3294551,5,B00114UUL8,"This was an amazing conclusion to a very well done series. It managed to keep things changing and unexpected, all while presenting a well told and dynamic conclusion to the story and avoiding significant cliches. Everything introduced throughout the series 50 episode run comes together to present this concrete and satisfying conclusion that manages to avoid making things feel to fairy tale or textbook, but still doesn't fall in to the trap of overdoing it or making things too ambiguous and leaving a lot of loose ends.

This series is a character drama, and as such that is the real focus of the finale. The conflict and how it presents itself plays a significant factor, no doubt about it, but Renton and Eureka are the true focus and in that regard they pull it off perfectly. It's a roller coaster ride with a lot of ups and downs, times that feel like all is lost and times you can't help but cheer at the screen. On top of that, a lot of things are explained in this volume regarding the story and the world the series takes place on.

All in all it's a magnificent conclusion that doesn't disappoint. I find that usually is the biggest problem I encounter with anime is that the conclusions tend to be disappointing. I'm very happy that Eureka Seven, one of my favorite series, did not encounter this problem. This is especially relieving considering I read the manga through and was disappointed by how it was concluded.

This is a special edition, so it comes with a shirt like the others. In this case we get a light green shirt in size large with the military's logos printed on the upper front and upper back of the shirt. It also comes with the 2nd, and last, volume of the 2nd manga series; ""Gravity Boys & Lifting Girl"", which isn't bad, but it doesn't relate to the events in the series much at all. Another soundtrack is also provided with the full versions of all the intro and closing songs in the series, and for the game as well. It also has the final song of the series, though that was also provided as a full version in the second OST with volume 7.",1209254400,4,2077,4.474934036939314

The last 10 episodes were just magnificent and I cant even count the amount of times I was on the verge of tears (ep 45 especially) While the show was slow to start none of those episodes were wasted. The quality of the character development for Eureka and Renton is just staggering, even the kids in the final eps.

Turns out Eureka has adopted 3 kids. Renton and Eureka, under the age of 16 or 15, try to take care of 3 spoiled kids while fighting a war and serving aboard the Gekkostate. Too many times does the show center around the kids and their emotions that at times it drags on. There is a somewhat decent scifi mecha storyline and the supporting cast saves the series from being too childish. Clearly this show is intended more for children than adults.
There are so many emotional breakdowns throughout the series from Renton, Eureka, and her adopted kids that it gets exhausting (I can't begin to fathom how the voice actors could keep it up).",1397088000,2,816,4.52027027027027

About this release; for those of you that don't own the series but want to, DO NOT buy these sets for their outrageous prices! Why? Because, in case you didn't know already, Funimation has recently licensed Eureka Seven, and is planning to re-release it next year (2014) on DVD AND Blu-ray as well, for reasonable prices. So anyone wanting to own the series just be patient, and you'll be able to get it. It makes since this happened anyway. I mean, many fans of this anime along with myself hoped it would come to this, and we knew the day would come eventually, since they did license the sequel, Eureka Seven AO. But yeah, that's my advice to you, wait for the Funimation release. That's what I'm doing.

This show... I have seen many anime. Many, many anime--but this still remains at the top for me. There's just something special about this one... About the characters and their development, about the uniqueness of the world that it takes place in, about the artwork and animation and the soundtrack that that really adds a that final topping of awesomeness as you see these giant, humanoid LFOs reffing on the trappars.

The show itself is definitely a 5/5, but I was unhappy to see that EVERY disc in this new, unopened collection had small scuffs and scratches, a couple of them even had more severe wounds and I wondered if it would play the episodes properly. Luckily, nothing is wrong with it on a technical level.

3294603,5,B00114UUL8,"I remember the first time I watched Evangelion, I was blown away... I've been searching around for an anime to rival the caliber of my favorites, EVA, Death Note, FMA:B... But  none has really drawn me in like they did- until this.

As others have stated, there seem to be EVA influences in E7. But besides them, E7 is it's own animal completely. It's a different style (for lack of a better word) than EVA. Honestly, the love story in E7 is far more interesting than EVA. Whereas Rei never seems to find sanity and always seems... distant... (SPOILER) **you get to enjoy witnessing Eureka finally realize she loves Renton. I was biting my nails in frustration and anticipation for them to finally embrace.

Anyways, this isn't as good as the EVA movies (1.11, 2.22), though it's far better than the Neon Genesis series. The voice acting in EVA:NG was HORRIBLE! Thank gawd that it vastly improved with the recent remakes. I still love the moment when Shinji finds his inner badass at the end of 2.22. But... as a whole, E7 is just more fluid.

If you want my opinion, E7 is up there:

EVA: Neon Genesis < Eureka Seven < Evangelion 1.11/2.22

If you haven't seen this series and love Mecha-Anime, buy it... Now!",1327708800,3,1210,4.578703703703703
3294604,4,B00114UUL8,"Won't argue its not good. Really I enjoyed the show. It is a very unique world and very enjoyable in style and presentation. Surfing mecha was something I hadn't considered before, let alone sky surfing mecha. The characters along with this are all quite enjoyable.

I will however give the series a thumb down for getting inspiration from Evangelion. I get it that EVA was an epic anime which defined a generation. But frankly, not everyone likes EVA or sitting through a psychotherapy session with a character that never seems to learn anything. This happens in the story very strongly with Renton. It gets to the point you just want to strangle the little brat. I get his anguish, really I do. But enough, time to move the story along. Thankfully E7 does, unlike EVA which even in the end never gets beyond psychosis.

The other thumb down would be involving the structure and storytelling of the second half. It is considerably weak. The backstory that sounded so epic as it was built up, seems to disappear when you find out what is really going on. What the lifeforms are and the scenes following that are quite anti climactic. Then as it finally comes to completion it leaves you mildly satisfied with a lot of questions and not enough answers.

Really its a great show, enjoy it for what it does right. But enough with the EVA love already. How much something copies or doesn't copy EVA should not be a standard of if it is good or not. Seeing a protagonist hero being presented as a human through anguish is one thing, but not moving past that and not finally learning how to cope just turns a show from a great piece, into little more watching a kid cower and whine over and over.",1309651200,,1690,4.534426229508196
3294635,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka seven is a great anime title, one of the best ever, but this is a product review.

First off the packing is very nice, the art on the discs is amazing, I was stunned just seeing the disc in the case, the video and audio quality...Its the best i have ever seen.  It is so beautiful, the colors pop out so well...You just have to own this, it looks so good.",1301443200,,362,4.013888888888889
3294636,5,B00114UUL8,I am very satisified with this transaction. It arrived promptly when it was supposed to and in excellent condition. I have used amazons services many times and I will continue to for the forseable future.,1300838400,,204,4.857142857142857
3294637,5,B00114UUL8,"If you're looking at this I'm sure you've already seen the rave reviews for this series elsewhere, so I'll briefly add my two cents that this is indeed the single best science fiction series ever, animated or otherwise.

Volume 2 (don't forget to buy volume 2 as well) concludes the series with the same perfection you are soon to experience in this first half of the series. By the time the series ends, ""Eureka seveN"", unlike so many other series, not only answers every question you may have had and delivers several ""Holy crap!"" surprises, it actually has a very good, very satisfying ending.

I'm a very nit-picky person when it comes to my entertainment, but other than breathing at high altitudes and at tremendous speeds without some kind of air mask and and never changing their clothes despite several scenes where the female cast go shopping, there is not one scene, not one word of dialogue, which I can complain about. ""Eureka seveN"" is not only a fantastic and original science fiction story, it is impeccably well told from start to finish. Like ""Cowboy Bebop"", it's the kind of showpiece you can lend to your anim hating friends to show them than anim has come a long way since ""Robotech"" and ""Captain Harlock"" that they watched on TV when they were little.

Nice menus, good quality video and audio, and the English voice acting is as good as the original Japanese cast (yes it is, purists -- accept it) and I'd go so far as to say it's better because having Renton (the main character) voiced by a boy instead of a woman sounds a lot more convincing. Subtitle options include the now standard (for the most part) of well translated full subtitles or translations for Japanese words that appear in scenes only. Also, the opening and ending songs include both English translations and romaji for those who enjoy singing along.

My only disappointment is that the audio wasn't remastered into surround sound, but otherwise this collection is proof that Bandai finally ""gets it"" and has stopped buying properties to just dump cheap English dubs on us.

The extra's are a bit dry and the limited number of trailers for other series is disappointing as is having the first two openings and endings appearing textless only once each, but it's a far cry from Bandai's past standard of not giving us any extras at all.

All of the commentary (one episode per disc) is ""hosted"" by the Japanese voice actors for Renton and Eureka with one or two of the other cast members as ""guests"", and with few exceptions this is rather like listening to a bunch of friends getting together and talking as they rarely bother to comment on the show itself. The sole exception is when the director ""guests"" and gives insights into some of the symbolism, much to the surprise of the ditsy hosts who clearly thought that this was just another dumb animated series. You'll lose track of the number of times they say with shock and surprise ""...and this aired at 7am on Sunday morning!"" every time a serious scene comes on.

The cast interviews (again, one per disc) with the English and Japanese voice cast is hit or miss (mostly miss) but that's the case with most DVDs; however, I would have preferred interviews with the people responsible for the actual production of this series like the directors and writers as I'd love to hear more about the symbolism, etc., but again, it's better than the nothing Bandai usually gives us.

In conclusion, don't hesitate to buy this series, and specifically, this two volume set of the complete series of ""Eureka seveN"" as this is no cheap bootleg or half-assed production: This is a good quality product.",1300838400,16,3636,4.7239747634069404
3294638,5,B00114UUL8,"I've been conditioned to say ""Cowboy Bebop"" whenever asked what my favorite anime series is, and for good reason: I've been a fan of that series for going on a decade and it was quite a revelation on first viewing. I hadn't seen anything like it before and it really only gets better with repeat viewings.
...but upon purchasing this DVD set and rewatching it for the first time since it left American airwaves I have to acknowledge that Eureka Seven is my favorite anime.

Why? Well, for one thing I suppose it boils down to me being a romantic at heart, and there is a lot of sentimentality going on in Eureka Seven. As a matter of fact, gosh-darn true love is the biggest theme of the series! But that's not to say it's all mushy stuff. In actuality a lot of horrible things happen in the world of Eureka Seven and there's tragedy and brutality to spare. That's what makes the romance, hope, and various other positive emotions also on display mean something: beauty in the face of adversity.

Of course, an assortment of likeable characters, beautiful animation, and a really kickass soundtrack also help!

But let's get to the matter at hand: this DVD set containing the first 26 episodes.

Eureka Seven is one of the few full-year (around 50 episodes) long anime that held my attention all the way through. It's the perfect length: I never felt like there was filler or things were being dragged out. The story is exactly as long as it needs to be, and one of the reasons the 50 episode format works is that each half of the series is very different. To put it bluntly: this DVD set introduces us to the world and the relationships, and we have ample time to explore them both. The second half, which is the next DVD set, plunges this world which we are now emotionally invested in into a hell. Dramatic, no?

To be more specific: Eureka Seven occurs in a far-off future where the human race dwells on a mysterious planet covered in something called ""Scub Coral"" and with the atmosphere full of something called ""Trapar Waves."" The Trapars are cool, because it allows one to do the really uber-cool sport of ""lifting,"" basically surfing in the sky. It also allows the various technologies like robots and flying machines to fly. 14 year old Renton loves to lift, and he idolizes legendary lifter Holland and his counter-culture commune The Gekkostate. When Renton ends up actually meeting The Gekkostate he joins and finds out it isn't as glamorous as he imagined: Holland can be difficult to get along with, the members of the crew all have to work for their keep, and to top it all off they're not so much a group of carefree lifters as a band of government rebels! But in consolation for Renton he meets and falls in love (at first sight) with a  mysterious Gekkostate member his own age, a girl named Eureka who pilots an equally mysterious robot called The Nirvash. Renton's arrival triggers a change in both Eureka and the Nirvash, so Holland makes Renton's Eureka's partner, much to his delight - but he has no real conception of what the real motives of the Gekkostate are, and just what he has got himself into.",1300147200,4,3126,4.573214285714286
3294639,5,B00114UUL8,"Eureka Seven is a fun anime with humour, action, romance and fighting. It evokes all kinds emotions. It also possesses the best ending I have ever seen for an anime series. For more info about eureka seven go to this website. [...]",1287792000,,231,4.523809523809524

3294642,5,B00114UUL8,This is an awesome collection! I've waited for a few years for them to start releasing this series in complete collections instead of single volumes. This is a great buy and you will not be disappointed!,1254700800,3,203,4.666666666666667
3294643,3,B00114UUL8,"I know what some, if not most of you, are thinking... 3 STARS? I have seen the entire series, all the way to its conclusion. I decided to write this review to give a little warning about what could have been one of the best anime mecha shows in the last few years.

Now my review of the rest of the series is why I am writing this today. The first ""season"" of Eureka Seven ( 1-26 ) is an incredible roller coaster ride that will both dazzle you and take you to places you wouldn't have considered before. The second half of the series however is an INCREDIBLE disappointment. What was strong in the first season is weak in the second. Strangely, also some episode budgets must have been cut in the second season as I could see marked difference in quality between episodes. By far some of the worst episodes are in the second half of the show and I cannot begin to tell you how bad they are without possibly spoiling part of the story for you which I am loathe to do. The story potential that was in the first half of Eureka Seven with its mysteries and life lessons are concluded badly and at times forgotten about in the second half, basically meaning the show felt like they were creating the ending as they were releasing episodes. This generally works well in episodic shows but with such buildup, character development, and mystery that was in the first half this does not work here. To be honest if it was not for the first half I doubt I would have been able to finish watching the second, it was that painful to watch at times.

I wrote this review to warn you what will be coming ahead and to say that Eureka Seven is an excellent anime with an unfortunate finish. I am not saying do not watch this show but to just be a little wary of the second half, it could have been so much better.",1252713600,10,1797,4.251461988304094
3294644,5,B00114UUL8,"""Eureka Seven"" is one of the most breathtaking mecha series, even if robot surfing seems a little too cheesy to take seriously.

The sport in this series is called lifting, a form a airboarding. It's all the rage. The main character of ""Eureka Seven,"" 14-year-old Renton Thurston, is hell-bent on become a great lifter, just like his idol, Holland Novak. But all his plans change when a cute blue-haired girl named Eureka crashes her LFO robot into his home. When enemy LFOs attack her robot, Renton is faced with daunting responsibility of saving the girl he loves.

After the battle in the sky, Renton is greeted by Holland with an offer to come aboard his ship, the Gekkostate. This is an offer that Renton cannot refuse, and the start of his new adventures.

""Eureka Seven"" is a beautiful masterpiece of flashing colors, liquid-smooth fighting animation and romance. Although it opens like a simple romance, it develops into a hard-edged drama of humongous proportions. Gekkostate is at war with the United Federation Force over the fate of the world, and the battles are emotionally shattering.

For starters, Eureka is as emotionally detached as the Evangelion character, Rei Ayanami. She hides the crushing emotional guilt of killing innocent people. And as much as Holland hides the truth, Renton is bound to discover that Eureka is an emotionally depressed girl who is definitely out of this world. Literally.

Eureka and Renton express extreme angst throughout the series, but their relationship is very compassionate. There's plenty of sadness in the middle of this volume of the collection. However, the characters' constant struggle to help each other through the most difficult times is incredibly heartwarming.

""Eureka Seven"" is a series which I can never stop watching. Even when Holland's defensive hold on Eureka tends to overwhelm Gekkostate, Renton is a remarkable character who truly understands what is best for her.

Although the release of the Complete Collection  of Eureka Seven is far overdue, the drama and power of ""Eureka Seven"" is still unmatched. Get it now, while it's still cheap.",1249171200,2,2115,5.110144927536232

While nothing is wrong with the actual box set, I found Eureka Seven to be a terrible series overall. With whiny, unlikable characters. a plot that is not only hard to follow but uninteresting, and misleading character actions I really can't stand this anime. I've watched the first thirty episodes and it hasn't gotta better. The only thing E7 has going for it is a recognizable voice cast that does a knockout job aside from Renton.
