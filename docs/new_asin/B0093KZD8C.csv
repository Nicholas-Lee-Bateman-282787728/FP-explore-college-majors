5256293,3,B0093KZD8C,"A serviceable, no frills low budget genre picture that delivers what you expect and no more for 95% of the film, standing out very very slightly from the pack because of a good final scene.",1438473600,,189,4.428571428571429
5256294,5,B0093KZD8C,"Another Kind has one of those story elements that keeps you on the edge, guessing what really is going on from the moment the characters snowshoes get strapped on. The atmosphere of the film is one of solemn unease. You almost feel the tragedy from the beginning of the film even before anything significant happens. There is just a well conveyed sense of  apprehension that seemed to infect me as I watched the film. The actors do an above apt  job bringing these characters to life, it is impressive just how comfortable they seem in front of the camera. The performances are genuine and engaging. I felt invested in the characters wellbeing which intensified the chilling nature of the story. In all honesty Another Kind reminded me more of Yellow Brick Road with a surprise sci-fi twist ending. I bounced back and forth on whether the film was a nightmare flip out of psyches or if the things were really happening that I was seeing on screen.  The film gives good thrills.

The special effects are limited, but mostly because there are very few moments in the film that require anything extra, Another Kind works more on psychological horror and tension than physical gruesomeness. The sound track and nightmarish situations are what pull the punches with this film, punches are more often creepy and unsettling with almost no lull. The sounds and cinematography used in Another Kind is reminiscent of the classic age of horror films from the late 70s and early 80s. Not with gimmicks but with a natural style just seems timeless and recognizable. Oh and the ending on this film remains pretty elusive right up until the very end, and it is a cool ending that I was not expecting. I knew there was a certain sci-fi component because of the title and possible truth behind the events that unfold in the film, I just wasn't expecting the ending that happens in Another Kind and it was rewarding. This film actually made me a bit uneasy after it was over, considering I live in the mountains, surrounded by forests that can be pretty frickin creepy at times.",1432339200,6,2060,4.713888888888889
5256295,2,B0093KZD8C,"[Being nice to give 2 stars, Spoiler Alert]  This film is touted as being made in the tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but that's not necessarily a compliment, unless you like waiting and waiting and waiting, only to be disappointed.  Three friends go hiking deep into the snowy Catskill Mountains in upstate New York to go skiing...or something (the fourth friend changes her mind).  They see strange lights at night through their tent, where much of the film seems to take place.  Prankster, psychopathic murderer, or alien? (though I guess it could be all three ;)).  In about the 64th minute of its 76-minute running time (wow, that's a long wait, though thankfully it's a relatively short movie), it gets very Twilight Zone or X-Files, but you'll be left frustrated and shaking your head.  Sorry but not recommended.",1423440000,4,828,4.920863309352518
5256296,3,B0093KZD8C,"Patrick (Patrick Woodall) leads a camping group of four in the Catskills, in winter. He let's us know he bought the equipment and his BMW cost $80,000. A few miles into the woods Patrick's girlfriend Jamie (Jamie Law) decides sleeping in a real bed in a hotel and not a tent is her idea of ""roughing it."" She leaves the group and heads back to the car.

Our threesome see some lights, have fun during a sledding montage, run into difficulty and the director has some fun with a red filter. Pretty soon the film feels like a Twilight Zone episode.

This is a low budget film, with no real special effects other than lights and filters. The four no-name actors were convincing in their roles like they were gearing up for Oscar night. Jonathan Blitstein did a fine job creating build up, although I think he gave too much away with the title.

This feature is available on a horror 10-pack. If you liked this try ""Yellow Brick Road"" or ""The Corridor.""

Pretty standard set-up, Ive definitely been here before, but the execution is pretty different and thats what I liked about the movie. There is a creeping suspense thats almost omnipresent, which is great, but its not much of a secret as to whats going on. I pegged it pretty early and they never really tried to throw up any red herrings to sway me. The acting is pretty good and the direction is nice, a good pace throughout. Its a solid thriller that didn't blow me away, but it was very enjoyable.",1390608000,2,641,4.297520661157025
5256299,3,B0093KZD8C,"I rather enjoyed the build up, but either Another Kind inspired a similar Canadian  movie (the title of which escapes me right now) or ripped it off entirely. I'm inclined to say the latter, because there were other rip offs, e.g. from the Blair Witch Project. & in contrast to the other movie, the finale failed to explain most of the phenomena experienced by the campers.",1524009600,,373,4.651515151515151
5256300,4,B0093KZD8C,"Some people go on a winter hiking trip. It makes sense because they are planning to go to Nepal the next year and this is preparation for that. They don't need a map because they are going on a marked trail and one of them knows the trail well, plus they have high tech gadgets. There are some SIGNS that suggest what is happening to them so the ending isn't really that far out of this world. Very good acting and filming.
(The argument with the girlfriend who left was strange, as well as all the stuff she packed. I was suspicious of her.)
(One friend told the other that he almost went into another car's lane while driving, but he actually DID go into the other lane, not almost. I wondered if they were actually in a car accident and that's why they saw lights.)
(They also ate some special brownies that could have taken them on a psychedelic trip)
(They could have been freezing to death which causes people to hallucinate and their bodies can feel so hot that they take off their clothes while out in the snow.)

The odd scenes at the end by the lake were unnecessary, they didn't explain a few things and I would have liked a more overt presence from the antagonist.

Besides the slow, boring, implausible story that unfolds around a camping trip, there are plenty of clues early on that not much thinking went into this project:  People who scream at each other don't go backpacking together.  Nine miles a day in deep snow isn't realistic.  The mysterious events that occur on the trip don't have any relevance to the ending.

5256318,1,B0093KZD8C,"First thing you should realize is that this film is a modern dramatization of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, the well-known story of nine ski-hikers who all died together in the Ural Mountains under very mysterious circumstances in 1959. Since then, their deaths have been attributed to everything from tribal murders to Yeti or UFO attacks to wilderness hysteria to Russian military experiments.

The true story of Dyatlov Pass is still a profound mystery even today, and I'm surprised that the story is not dramatized and re-enacted more often than it is.

This movie pretty much touches all the bases of Dyatlov Pass conspiracy theory, more or less, while using only about half as many characters, and then desperately adds a truly brainless alien-invasion ending in the last 30 seconds.

It's as though the producers decided: ""Hey, we can't just leave the ending unresolved, like the real Dyatlov Pass Incident!  Hmm, what would J.J. Abrams do?""

So they threw in an alien invasion.

That's not just a desperate ending...that's a sloppy ending.",1521590400,,1044,5.076023391812866

I kind of figured that there was something very strange going on when they were not able to tell which direction they were going, and that things kept happening at night, in particular, but these guys really weren't too bright to begin with, as far as I'm concerned. Like, who sets out on a 27-mile hike through snow in freezing cold weather, in the first place? Not only that, but to constantly complain about how cold it is at nighttime especially, what did they expect? As far as when the weird stuff started happening at night, and then to just keep ignoring it as being nothing, well, so much for using one's common sense, because these guys didn't have any.

5256326,4,B0093KZD8C,"Released in 2013, Another Kind details events when four friends take a four-day snowshoeing hike in the Catskills and experience strange occurrences.

This is a micro-budget small film, reportedly only costing $120,000, but its so competently made it comes across as a bigger movie. It basically takes The Blair Witch Project template and makes a better movie. The four actors are all convincing and the dialogue, which might seem to contain a little too much bickering, is fairly realistic (Ive been on trips with couples who frequently argue, so I know it happens). The first half hour is pretty humdrum, but then the events and filmmaking magic take you into the story. I almost never get creeped-out during movies, but a few parts of Another Kind were seriously creepy. Unlike some mystery movies that keep everything a mystery at the end, Another Kind spells it out, which will be a turn-off to some and a good thing to others.

The film is short-and-sweet at 76 minutes and was shot in Catskill Mountains, New York, with the opening filmed in Brooklyn.

GRADE:  B

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further if you haven't seen the movie)

The ending reveals that theres an extraterrestrial attack on earth, so how does this explain the eerie events that the hikers experience. Evidently, the aliens assigned to this particular sector were toying with the hikers, like a cat with a mouse.

It's short (1 hour 15 minutes) and it's different enough that you won't feel like you've seen this movie before.  The movie itself is okay, with decent acting and dialogue - not so witty and clever as to be unbelievable.  These are four very believable characters reacting to their scenario in realistic ways (for the most part).

The reason I recommend this movie is the final seven minutes.  Don't skip ahead to that point without watching the rest of the movie, though.  It's basically a ""dream sequence"" that is masterfully done.  Without giving too much away, the movie should have ended with the end of the dream sequence, but instead there are an additional 1-2 minutes of ""reality"" that blatantly explains everything.  For me, I always prefer leaving the audience with a bit of mystery and letting them interpret the rest on their own.",1450137600,,947,4.7317073170731705
