8343602,5,B001UFPJK0,Very good documentary. You rarely find video crews willing to actually go into a burning enviroment just to get footage.,1386633600,,120,5.05
8343603,5,B001UFPJK0,"This film is a ""Must see"" for anyone interested in Firefighting or the behind the scenes of what it takes to be a firefighter.
I highly recommend watching it!! (So far I've watched it twice!)",1268784000,,191,4.485714285714286
8343604,5,B001UFPJK0,"I figured out only nine months ago that I wanted to be a Firefighter/Paramedic. I just watched this movie in my first Fire Science class, and it was quite the experience. At the end, my instructor said ""It's even hard just watching it, isn't it?"" and he was SO correct. I came out of seeing what must be done to get that cherished badge with a BIG mix of emotions. But it did make me want this career more than I did before seeing the film. It also helped that there was a mix of ages in the Fire Academy class that they follow, since I'm 34 just starting to go at this.

Bottom line--the film is engaging and fantastic to watch, whether you just want to know a little more about firefighting, or you are someone entertaining it as a career. I still have piles of stuff to learn before I figure I'll make it into my dream job, but this certainly helped cement my confidence and desire to pursue it.",1251158400,3,898,4.22093023255814
8343605,5,B001UFPJK0,"This is the real thing.  Firefighters go through strenuous training that an average person would not subject themselves to.  If you want to see what it's like to become a firefighter, you should see this film.  Do you have what it takes?",1241049600,,237,4.595238095238095
