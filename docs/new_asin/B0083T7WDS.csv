8524662,3,B0083T7WDS,"Not as good as I remembered it. I guess I was a googly-eyed kid when I watched it. It's too dated and slow now. The DVD is fine, as expected.",1404950400,,141,3.7333333333333334
8524663,5,B0083T7WDS,"The physical product - the dvd's were in perfect condition.  I had a hard time watching this but NOT because it was in any way
poorly done.  I read the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole when it was first published and have been keeping up with him ever since.
For me, reading the book was like being there with him - the story really invites you into his world.

I had difficulty then listening to the narration because I wasn't ""in his world"" so much as being outside of it as a casual
observer.  This doesn't mean it's bad - it just means that for me the books are far more inviting.",1362960000,,579,4.142857142857143
