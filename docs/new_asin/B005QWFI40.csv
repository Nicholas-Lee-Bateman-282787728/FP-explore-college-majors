4860679,5,B005QWFI40,"Capriccio represents the culmination of Strauss's operatic career, just as Metamorphosen and the Four Last Songs are the capstones of his orchestral and vocal writing.  Capriccio was premiered in 1942 in Munich, whose beloved opera house was destroyed by Allied bombing the following year.  The Nazi regime, too, soon fell, but Strauss's opera--focusing on eternal questions of love and art--has become increasingly popular and is widely considered one of his greatest works.

In the notes for this recording, George Hall writes, ""Despite the extreme circumstances surrounding its creation--catastrophic for the wider world, imbued with fear and shame for Strauss himself, whose chief concern during these years was to protect his beloved Jewish daughter-in-law and grandsons--Capriccio is far more than the piece of elegant escapism Strauss's detractors have claimed it to be.""  In Capriccio, he continues, Strauss ""reasserted his commitment to the values of art as a civilised and civilising pursuit at one of the periods when those values were most under threat.""

This production from the Metropolitan Opera could not be bettered.  Although the time is moved from the 18th to the early 20th century, the change of eras is hardly noticeable.  The setting (the interior of the Countess's chateau) and costumes are beautifully detailed and realistic.  Andrew Davis leads the musical forces in a superlative performance--from the ravishing opening sextet to the Countess's great closing monologue.  All of the singers are excellent, but Renee Fleming is the unquestioned star, who is on stage almost throughout and holds the opera together.  As Times reviewer Anthony Tommasini says, Fleming ""grab[s] every chance to let her voice bloom.""  In the final monologue her voice is ""plush and alluring, her phrasing noble.""

At the end of Capriccio, the questions the opera poses remain unresolved.  Words or music?  Poet or composer?  That is as it should be.",1320883200,36,1954,5.402640264026402
4860680,5,B005QWFI40,"The subject of Strauss' final opera might appear slight, but in reality it's a brilliant summation of issues that the composer explored throughout his career.  The opera itself consists of little more than a drawing room conversation between rich artists and intellectuals in an elegant Parisian chateau who talk endlessly about one subject; the eternal question of which is more important in opera, the words or the music.  This in turn leads to the characters deciding to write an opera about their conversation, and if that sounds like a fairly fruitless exercise on the part of Strauss, writing an opera that is about writing an opera about writing an opera, this self-reflexivity should come as no surprise to anyone who is familiar with Der Rosenkavalier or Ariadne auf Naxos.  Capriccio similarly is a masterfully constructed opera - you would expect nothing less from Richard Strauss - that frustratingly seems a little more intellectualised than truly emotional or from the heart.  What redeems those earlier works however are the little moments of heartfelt truths that are reached and expressed, principally though the music itself, but Capriccio seems to recognise that there are other less easily defined aspects to art and music that keep it vital and alive.

Appropriately, while there's no doubt that the sublime Rene Fleming singing Strauss as the Countess is the main attraction here, Capriccio is an ensemble piece, since each of the parties involved in the discussion are practically personifications of Music, Poetry and Drama, and it's the ensemble that is important in a work of opera.  The role of the Countess may not seem to be as important as those other elements in the scheme of the composing of an opera but she has perhaps the most vital role of all.  What that role is isn't exactly defined and it's left for the listener to determine what that magic element is, but as the host, she could be - in hard-edged practical terms - the financer, or, more mystically, she is in some ways the inspiration, or even the harmony that brings Music and Words together.  She is also the audience, on whose reception, personal interpretation and personal identification the success of the drawing together of the various elements counts most.  It's not by chance then that the Countess leaves the ending of the opera (and on a notionally dramatic level, her choice of the two suitors) open.  The ultimate meaning and value of an opera lies, as it should, with the listener.

It's appropriate then that the weight of the argument is perfectly balanced on all sides, with all vital components that may go into an opera, particularly in the ideal of opera (considered to be Gluck here, as elsewhere), individually shown to their full worth in Strauss' beautiful flowing compositions.  The Met's 2011 production, a single act opera in a period room, itself demonstrates the value of staging, and it's just perfect.  But in order for the opera to be more than the sum of its parts, it needs more than just the ensemble bringing them all together.  It needs the Countess.  It needs that receptive audience.  It needs the magic.  To be specific, it needs Rene Fleming.  And this is the genius of Strauss' work in Capriccio, in that he knows that the opera work is not complete and is never static, but alive.  It's as if Strauss had composed the opera for Rene Fleming, for a singer who, in those final moments, can bring something unique and special to that vital closing aria where she reaches out to the audience and communicates something ineffable, meaningful and personal.  It's a blissful moment that opens up everything that opera is and should be about, and this performance of it is simply magical.",1320796800,14,3719,4.89171974522293
4860681,5,B005QWFI40,"The DVD isn't out yet, but I just wanted to put in a word about how lovely and enrapturing this performance is. I saw the live broadcast in a Minneapolis theater and I was simply blown away by every aspect of it. Renee Fleming will capture your heart with her gorgeous singing and her portrayal of a woman who has to choose between two lovers. (The one slight false note, IMO, is her contemporary hair styling; doesn't look right for the period. But I can live with that.) The rivals for her heart are finely drawn and sung--the musician passionate and headlong; the poet buttoned-up and nervous, but desperate for the Countess's love. The supporting singers are right on target--characterful and funny. The Met sets and costumes are excellent. And Andrew Davis does a solid job in the pit. This was Strauss's last opera--and what a tuneful, touching human story to tell right at the end of his incredible career.",1320192000,21,913,4.7125
4860682,5,B005QWFI40,Good casting is so critical in opera and in Capriccio the nuance and subtle phrasing requires a soprano that not only has the technical gifts to manage Strauss' high-level requirements but a soprano who literally loves to sing Strauss.  Renee Fleming acquits herself well on both accounts.  The supporting cast is also first rate and Andrew Davis' conducting is perfectly balanced with the dynamic range of this music.  The blu-ray is flawless and staring at the lovely Ms. Fleming singing you really get the feeling that she is singing directly to you.  Highly recommended.,1398211200,,574,5.074468085106383
4860683,5,B005QWFI40,"We watched this on the Met in HD program and loved it--had to own it!  For us theatre professionals, the story is really great and so well done in this production.",1379808000,,163,4.258064516129032
4860684,5,B005QWFI40,"While this production was indeed wonderful, I found the story to be a bit plodding. I had a hard time caring about any of the folks portrayed. Voices and the entire production was well done. This will simply never be one of my favorite operas. It is worth the price to hear Miss Fleming however.",1360195200,,295,4.381818181818182
4860685,5,B005QWFI40,"We have never known this opera though we knew many others. This particular one had never been staged in the former USSR (we are from there). After we saw it on screen we decided to have it at home. We played it at home again and love it even more. It is very well  staged and sung. DVD is of great quality, too.",1336435200,4,311,3.9365079365079363
4860686,4,B005QWFI40,Ms. Fleming has the ideal Strauss voice! This is a good production that respects the intentions of the composer. Joseph Kaiser's portrayal of his role is a good foil to Ms. Fleming's characterization.,1331424000,3,200,5.090909090909091
4860687,5,B005QWFI40,"Strauss called the opera Capriccio a conversation piece for music in one act. A discussion on what is more important in opera,the words or the music. The conclusion is that both are required when united into a single entity. Although Krauss is credited with the libretto in the printed score,much of it was written by Richard Strauss. He pleased himself and ended up pleasing his audiences. This last and 15th opera was premiered in 1942,National theatre,Munich. Strauss stayed behind in Nazi Germany, because he said he wanted to protect his Jewish daughter in law and two grand children. Probably he thought that art was above ordinary affairs, which it is not,for a artist should be in tune with their times, and stand up against injustice as conductor Busch and co did.

This opera is set in a Salon in a Paris Chateau in 1775, but director John Cox states that on stage it would add the air of a museum,diletantes idling their way through an afternoon,instead of professionals discussing their art with their patron. He updated Capriccio to Paris in the decade after World war 1. Patronesses like the Princess de Polnagac commissioned works from Stravinsky, Cocteau etc. Many were concerned with finding new ways of combining words and music for avantguarde directors. Every era has its traditionalists and reformers, even though in this opera references are made to composers of the past.

The young widowed Countess Madeleine is celebrating her birthday. A young musician Flamand has written the music and Olivier a sonnet. Flamand and Olivier are also seeking the hand of the countess. While her brother the Count who does not like opera and is an amateur actor,is seeking the hand of Clarion. The reading of the sonnet is funny and does make a telling point about it,when music is added it changes the words. La Roche is probably based on a combination of the Theatre directors Strauss knew, Reinhardt and Hofmannsthal. Through this character Strauss has a dig at the music of the time and the young peoples feelings about him. His own views on his own art,and has a subtle dig at Theatre directors. In this opera la Roche is organising large scale entertainment for the Princess, and brings along two ballet dancers, who are funny, and the two opera singers who try to out do each other. One eats and drinks too much. In the end the Countess suggests Flamand and Olivier work together on an opera. The count suggests that an opera could be made out of the events that have just happened. The countess leaves us to make up our mind about  opera and goes to dinner. A very clever opera.

Capriccio is funny,witty has digs at the theatre of opera and has beautiful music, such as the opening sextet, love duet,the moonlight interlude,and the monologue sung by the countess at the end. The countess is one of Strauss most heartfelt creations,sung as if born to play the part by Renee Fleming. Flamand is sung by Tenor Joseph Kasier sensitively. Russell Braun is ideal as Olivier. Peter Rose fits the part La Roche perfectly, Clarion the mezzo is funny and is a fine actress. The count, the brother of the countess Morten Larsen is a fine choice. The acting is superb and  all the singers are as one in this ensemble piece. Andrew Davis Conducts the Metropolitan opera orchestra with emotion and captures the Straussian long line. Traditional and beautiful. The scenery does not change.

4860688,1,B005QWFI40,"It is one of the most boring opera production I have seen. Renee Fleming who is supposed to hold the opera together as the coutess adds little to the opera. With plastic smile pasted on her face at all times, no emotions can be read from her.",1325289600,9,242,4.170212765957447
4860689,2,B005QWFI40,Fleming is colorless and unconvincing both as an actor and as a singer. She has none of the erotic energy required for this role.,1325116800,6,129,4.416666666666667
4860690,5,B005QWFI40,"I was lucky enough to see this production at the Met in the spring of 2010 the same week that the production was broadcast and recorded. The story of the opera is really fun especially for anyone that has spent time on the stage in any capacity. The entire story is all about what makes art, so it really speaks to me in a way that few operatic stories do. Renee Fleming is so perfectly suited to this music that it is a blessing that it has been captured on video. I saw it at the Met, again when PBS broadcast it and then tonight I watched the Blu-Ray that arrived yesterday. I imagine I will watch it countless more times over the years to come. The picture and sound quality is simply astounding. There is not a weak link in the cast. If you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favor. See it as soon as you can.",1324425600,3,815,4.1
4860691,4,B005QWFI40,"For an opera that makes little or no concession to being part of the regular repertoire Capriccio is now available in three different productions and Fleming is repeatting the role she previously taped in France. This is fortunate since her first dvd displays an utterly self absorbed performance that is truly unfortunate. The entire production had unfortuate aspects that were gratuituous, e.g., Nazi elements simply because the work was composed during WWWII. During the interim Fleming did a Countess for Vienna State Opera which was telecast; it was reported to be superb. Alas we will probably never get to see it.

I have no objection to time traveling if it adds something to the mix--or doesn't get in the way of performaing the opera. Here it is all very chic and stylish but it does seem at odds with the text at many points. With references to Gluck and other 18th Century composers who are essentially ""names"" in that they are only going to be found in reference books what has been achieved? Well very little. When Sellars moved Figaro to Trump Tower he at least had an idea, a concept in mind and was able to justify his artistic decision. We can reject it or accept it but at least Sellars had thought his concept through. The libretto by Kraus and Strauss is unique in that it deals with problems facing opera composers. To a certain extent this has been humanized by creating the characters of Flamand and Olivier. composer and poet both in love with the Countess who must choose one of them. Of course she can't, and Strauss has given his soprano one of the most glorious set pieces he has ever written in which her dilema remains undecided.

The entire score for the opera may be the most flawless piece Strauss has ever written: witty, referential and gorgeous. The Monnacht music along is worth the price of the disc. And generally the singing in this taping is very fine. Fleming has improved over her previous performance yet I find Te Kanawa preferable ultimately; she certainly has the superior enssemble, but the ""coolness"" of her Madelaine seems more in keeping with her aristocratic mien; vocally I find her less mannered. I hope the next commercial release of this opera will featurre a German speaking singer simply for the nuance that is available to her. The only singer whom I find weak is Morton Frank Larsen. A Danish singer who deputized for Thomas Hampson in a production of Arabella at Zurich Opera was utterly miscast. Two famous lyric baritones have sung the role of Mandryka and survived: Hampson and Fischer-Dieskau. but these were two savy singers who couuld tread the role and knew how to survive. Mr. Larsen alas left us with an incipient wobble which is not not as evident in this new recording since the role is short and not required to provide us with legato singing--but it's there and a pity! If I could only have one Capriccio I would have to opt for Kiri but I am glad that  companies are willing go out on a limb as it were with a product that will never guarantee financial rewards--a rare quality these days.",1321920000,14,3065,4.682745825602969

8483888,5,B005QWFI40,"Exquisitely sung, acted, and staged, this production fulfilled my every hope for Capriccio, Richard Strauss' final opera. Renee Fleming is in great voice and her acting impeccable.  I have looked for faults, but cannot find any. Simply lovely!",1464220800,,243,5.394736842105263
8483889,5,B005QWFI40,"The production and the singing is faultless, I still cannot quite comprehend how the performers remember their tuneless parts and the endless lines which are all written in prose. This opera is a pure conversation piece where most of the time nothing much happens. It has the scenes of the ballerina on her tippi-toes which are ridiculed by the onlookers and the scene of the operatic sentimental duet in the Italian ""belle vocce""style again
laughed at by others and this humor break the monotony of the half spoken conversation. This is an experiment which in my opinion, did not quite work out.
The overture and the interlude are exquisite pieces of chamber music, a great credit to the late output of Richard Strauss. The composer together with the conductor Clemens Krauss wrote the complex libretto after an unsuccsessful search for a suitable writer. The opera culminates in the long aria sung by the countess Madelaine provides a great vehicle for the soprano voice in which she finally expresses her indecision about the
values that separate poetry and music. Of course Renee Fleming's artistry is without a question.",1443484800,,1125,5.021390374331551
8483890,5,B005QWFI40,Renee Fleming is wonderful here! Her warm golden voice is perfect for Madeleine's arias and she seems entirely comfortable in the role as she ponders which of her suitors she loves. The music here is achingly beautiful throughout beginning with a wonderful string sextet as the overture. An admirable production and a must for any opera lover.,1433894400,,343,5.035087719298246

8483892,5,B005QWFI40,"Coloratura does not get better than Renee Fleming.  The libretto manages to be a serious discussion about various aspects of the performing arts.

8483895,5,B005QWFI40,"Loved the Met HD broadcast:  Strauss, Fleming, ballet, and humor all in the mix.  I'm not an opera critic who will pick apart the details of a performance ... I buy based on what I've enjoyed, sampling other versions of loved performances, and comparing new and old performances by particular singers.  I just remembered that during the broadcast of this performance, I added it to my OPERA DVDs TO LOOK FOR to-do list.  Since the Met publishes only 2 productions from each season, I was surprised and happy to find this one pop up.
