6647585,5,B00NCZ971S,"My interests in opera are primarily in the Italian repertory; Mozart has not been on my list of favorite operatic composers, although his symphonic, chamber and instrumental works are enjoyed a lot here. But when I saw this set come up for pre order, I was tempted. So I checked the reviews here of the individual performances and saw that there were mostly five star reviews from reviewer colleagues whose opinions I respect.

I am delighted with the set; at the price, we have the three DaPonte operas from the ROH, all with excellent casts and all recorded in Blu ray, with its attendant picture and sound qualities. Although the performances are not new, the Magic Flute dating from 2003, the quality of the singing and acting is first rate. These are performers who are still much in demand today and to catch them in younger days is kind of neat. But be sure that these are not juveniles.

For reviews of individual opera, I refer you to the listings for the operas for some very fine evaluations. I have watched the Marriage of Figaro and the Magic Flute since the set arrived here and found both to be well performed, with great singing and traditional staging. The technical qualities of the discs is as good as it gets.

Buy with confidence, gentle reader.",1416009600,3,1266,4.642857142857143

6647588,5,B00NCZ971S,"This set is a repackaging of three classic recent productions from Covent Garden that have been highly praised and extensively reviewed. They are ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" (2006, Pappano), ""Don Giovanni"" (2002, Mackerras) and ""Die Zauberflote"" (2003, Davis). The set is offered as either DVD or as Blu-Ray. The Blu-ray set is made of upconversions from original studio masters which are of higher quality than DVD. The images and audio are of very high quality.

The cast lists are very impressive and while the production values are uniformly high and this is a great bargain and a ""must-buy"", be aware that these are big, modern productions with period costumes and sets and I dare say they won't be the only ones you'll want, as good as these are.

I've been watching different ""Don Giovanni"" videos lately and just of newer ones, I hope you'll get to see the new Sferisterio production with Ildebrando Arcangelo (Frizza) and the new Covent Garden with Marius Kwiecien (Luisotti), and an interesting period production from Innsbruck with Johannes Weiser (Jacobs). There are many good choices out there should you decide to further explore. In the meantime, be sure to get a copy of this.

This set comes as 5 discs (as original) as a book with clear styrene pages, one per disc, plus a booklet with cast lists, credits and essays for each opera. It is not 3 individual cases. If you already have duplicates on your shelf, they make great gifts - or sell them on Amazon!",1415318400,3,1467,4.790513833992095

6647595,5,B00NCZ971S,"I've only seen Le Nozze di Figaro, but I loved this performance of it. I'd bought Ponnelle's version of it, and the difference between them is like night and day. I couldn't stand Ponnelle's version. But this one is a joy to watch. David McVicar has done an outstanding job of bring Mozart's music along with his humor to the stage. And the performers in this version are MUCH more enjoyable to watch (and listen to) than those in Ponnelle's version. I can't imagine a better production.",1422662400,3,487,4.609195402298851

6647599,5,B00NCZ971S,"I bought this for the Figaro, and got the other two thrown in as an extra bonus.  I had been looking for this production of Figaro every since I saw it on Public Television.  Incredible chemistry and outstanding acting makes this one of the most sensual Figaro productions I've ever seen.
The only one better (better sung, that is), is the James Levine production with Kathleen Battle, Ruggiero Raimonde, Carol Vaness, and Frederica Von Stade.  Hard to find, though, and before the days of HD.
Haven't watched the other two yet, but will update this review when I do.  The price of these three was the same as just the Figaro by itself.  Nice packaging.  Five discs each held in clear plastic insert.  Very sturdy, without taking up a lot of room on a shelf.",1417305600,7,758,4.57037037037037

8677457,5,B00NCZ971S,"What a tremendous bargain. Mozart's greatest operas in one box set , all with top notch productions by The Royal Opera. The delightful comic complexity of Le nozze di Figaro, and it's lovely costumes and fine performances. The shocking and lively artistic production of Don Giovanni superbly brings out the charm of the vicious, lecherous scoundrel, a brilliant opera filled with darkness and even terror. Finally, Die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute) my favourite opera of all. This production is completely fantastic, it's excellent costumes and sets and remarkable performances of some of the most memorable characters in opera (The Queen of the Night and Papageno are showstoppers), this makes for great comedic and intelligent entertainment. This entire box set is hours of pure entertainment. This is best of the Opus Arte opera box sets in my opinion, but each composer's style is different, and the Verdi and Puccini boxes are also fully recommended and all offer multiple viewings. Blu ray makes this like being in the theater and adds to the grand experience.",1528156800,,1066,5.167630057803469
8677458,5,B00NCZ971S,"Have only watched Die Zauberflte so far, but it was incredible. And one other review notwithstanding, the entire opera is on a single disk. Presumably it's a shorter work than Don Giovanni or La nozze de Figaro, which are on two dvds each.",1523750400,,239,4.5813953488372094

DON GIOVANNI (4.5 stars)  2002
Simon Keenlyside is Don Giovanni. Joyce DiDonato is Donna Elvira. Miah Perrson is Zerlina. Charles Mackerras conducts. Francesca Zambello directs the stage. Excellent singing and acting. The scenery is often vague, not aiding the story. There was no hint of a graveyard in the graveyard scene. Unnecessary nudity.

8677461,5,B00NCZ971S,"I write this review as both an opera lover, especially of these three Mozart operas, and as a techie/audiophile. I'd highly recommend this 3-opera package, with a few caveats (I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could). All three operas are wonderful productions, as one might expect from The Royal Opera. The music, singing, acting, etc. are first rate. (Note that I purchased the Blu Ray version(s).)

Why the half-star deduction?

Visual Quality: The visual quality is very good, if not quite excellent, for both Figaro and Giovanni. The visual quality of Die Zauberflote, however, is very disappointing. In scenes where there is shadow or other dark areas, it looks like the ""snow"" that people of my age remember when one's TV antenna was too far from the station. In bright well-lit scenes, the visual quality rises to good, but definitely not full 1080p quality. I wondered if they had mistakenly put a DVD of DZ into the package (no, it was a BR disk). Perhaps I received a bad copy.

Audio quality: (I should note that I use a relatively high-end 5.1 surround sound audio system; what I describe here may perhaps be too subtle for the average listener.) The audio quality is excellent, with one BIG caveat. When I first watched/listened to each of the operas, I was quite disappointed with the sound. In particular, in all three, the orchestra was a bit too loud in relation to the vocals and the vocals sounded as if the singer was quite removed from the microphone, as if they were at the back of the stage, a bit muddled. Noting that the default audio on the disks (in the Set-Up menu) was ""Surround,"" I changed the setting to ""Stereo"" and was delighted with the result, which is very clear, with good ""presence,"" and excellent mix with the orchestra. Also interestingly, even set to Stereo, there was still some ""surround"" quality to the sound. I have no idea why the Surround setting produces poorer sound, but guess that the audio engineers may have tried to enhance the surround effect or something similar. At any rate, if you buy this package (you should), I'd highly suggest that the first thing you do after inserting the disk and seeing the disk's menu is to go to Set-Up and change the sound to ""Stereo.""",1494806400,12,2218,4.667519181585678
