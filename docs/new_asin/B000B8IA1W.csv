2408429,4,B000B8IA1W,"I saw this movie shortly after it first came out twenty-odd years ago, and loved it then. Besides its being a quick paced and funny effort, it really captures some of the machinations of the early religious TV players. Complete with a Charles Haid as the ""Drive-In Movie Evangelist,"" who is a combination of Robert Schuller and Gene Scott along with his ""Brother John"" accompanist who could be a knock-off of Scott's bearded head musician, Ron Spaan. Jack and Jeannie and their ""Jump for Jesus"" show could be either Jan and Paul Crouch or Jim and Tammy Baker. But, the auditions for ""talent"" for the new KGOD religious format is worth the price of admission. And Dove/Devo...how funny is that! All in all a very entertaining if forgotten movie that anyone who lived through it, will love.",1262995200,,788,4.759124087591241
2408430,3,B000B8IA1W,"A local TV station facing bankrupcy gets help from Marvin Fleece. His plan to save the station is to is simple: Turn it into a religious TV-station. It's a great success, ratings increase and advertising money pour in. But Fleece's motivation may not be to spread the gospel as he claims or to help the TV-station, but rather to make himself richer.

I can imagine that ""Pray TV"" might have been ahead of its time in 1980; the worst televangelism scandals were yet to come. That a TV-station woud turn religious just for profit is a great idea for a movie and ""Pray TV"" but the result was not quite as good as I had hoped. The movie has some quite funny moments and some of the new religious tv-shows are hilarious. As a whole, though, the story gets pretty thin after a while and the plotting is uneven. Not a great movie but one that certainly has its funny moments and may be worth checking out if you like early 1980s comedies or religious or media satire.",1254096000,,960,4.393258426966292
2408431,5,B000B8IA1W,"This movie is one of my favorites from the 80's - a dark comedy about the inner workings of failing TV station (KRUD). It gets bought out by Marvin Fleece, played by Dabney Coleman. He gets the brilliant idea to plug  religion into all of the same horrible programming and change the station's name to KGOD. Voila! Televangelism. Great ensemble cast, headlined by Dabney Coleman.  Many hilarious moments - look for Paul Reubens (aka PeeWee Herman) as a chain-smoking exercise show host, and many others in this gem! Don't miss it!",1168041600,,530,4.813186813186813
8083302,5,B000B8IA1W,"This movie is EXCELLENT, one of the best movies Dabney Coleman ever done & also has a SLEW of funny actors that will have you laughing your ass off especially Charles Haid playing the preacher asking for money & the guy doing the ""begot"" thing waaaaay toooo funny.....i laughed my ass off !!!!!!!",1517184000,,296,4.60377358490566
8083303,5,B000B8IA1W,"Prat TV  was  released in 1980. A looney,  crazy,  and funny film about TV evangelists. I loved the Soap Opera spoof with Deidre Hall and Jaime Lyn Baur from Days Of Our Lives. Fans of the irreverant will like this the most.",1511481600,,224,4.261904761904762
8083304,4,B000B8IA1W,This is an extremely funny satire spoofing 1980's television ratings wars and the hypocrisy of televangelism.,1461628800,,109,5.875
8083305,5,B000B8IA1W,"A hilarious satire about Televangelists.  Dabney Coleman stars as Marvin Fleece, no mistake of his last name, as he is as greedy and money hungry as they come.  He rescues a rundown radio station and turns it into a religious TV empire show where you only need to bring your cash, checkbook, and credit cards and give to the Lord!",1459814400,,330,4.483333333333333

8083307,5,B000B8IA1W,"Not a great movie but each little segment of the TV broadcast is like an very early SNL skit. With Peewee Herman as a gay exercise instructor, T.J. from ""Magnum, P.I""  as Jesse Jackson and Devo as a Christian rock band called DOVE how could it go wrong!",1404518400,,253,4.270833333333333

8083309,2,B000B8IA1W,"Funny movie but the picture quality is horrible.  Compared to even a lousy BluRay or DVD, this recording looks like a poorly made VHS Tape.  Horrible quality, very funny movie.  I'd give it 1 star but I did enjoy watching the movie...it's quite funny and reminds me of Jim and Tammy Baker.",1363824000,,289,4.519230769230769
