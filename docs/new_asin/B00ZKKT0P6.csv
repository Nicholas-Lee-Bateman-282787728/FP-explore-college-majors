8720471,4,B00ZKKT0P6,"This is a Spanish Thriller\Slasher that is mostly spoken in English except for a few places where Spanish is used and those are captioned. A woman (Alicia) blindfolds her boyfriend (Simon) and takes him to an apartment she has set up for the night in a nearly abandoned building. The only tenant is an old man who refuses to leave.

Later that evening some goons come to evict the old man by leathal means, find Simon and Alicia and know they can't just let them live! From here it becomes a game of cat and mouse,fight for survival. Simon and Alicia get separated , he has the phone but of course because Alicia blindfolded him on the way there he has no address to give emergency services.

As the men get outwitted,one calls for backup and the real psycho shows up with a big black bag full of knives,surgeon's tools and a huge Axe! The lighting and camera work were great. They filmed it in warm tones of  russet and gold making it pleasing to the eye and senses. The acting is superb even though the accents are quite thick at times.

There was a good amount of extremely well done gore and it was very realistic. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and found the entire experience rewarding and satisfying as it was chilling and supsesful as well.",1467504000,,1257,4.452173913043478
8720472,4,B00ZKKT0P6,"It was good enough to rent. But not worth buying. It was good though and it reminds me of the movie, ""The Panic Room.""",1465689600,,118,3.9583333333333335
8720473,3,B00ZKKT0P6,Not bad could have had subtitles for the non Spanish speaking community.,1465689600,,72,5.083333333333333
8720474,3,B00ZKKT0P6,"The film opens with a killer on Christmas Eve of an elderly woman in an old apartment building in Barcelona. Months later Alicia (Ingrid Garca Jonsson) inspects the nearly abandoned building for a real estate company. She uses the building as a secret rendezvous for her boyfriend Simon's  (Bruno Sevilla) birthday. He is English and is in the medical profession, needing to go back to school. While they are there...not to give too much away, but there is another break-in like the first and Alicia and Simon star in a ""home"" break-in film of hide and seek. Oriol Tarrida Homedes plays the bad guy who wears all black, has oversize ominous boots, wears a respirator (I don't know why) and drags the large cliche axe. There is apparently some confusion in Spain about which slasher characters belong where. Nothing new to see here.

Guide F-bomb. No sex. Ingrid Garca Jonsson in black bra and panties.",1441497600,2,901,4.806451612903226
