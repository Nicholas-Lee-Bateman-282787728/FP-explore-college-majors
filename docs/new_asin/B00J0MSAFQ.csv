8647164,5,B00J0MSAFQ,"A wonderful discovery, once you get over its syrupy, tinkling first minutes, this turns into a beautiful fable of love among the destitute, with every single close-up of fauna completely justified (there are many, and all pretty), and everything topped with a magnificently staged and shot animal revolt in the last act. Gene Raymond is very good and appropriately agile as the young man who grew up in the zoo, surrounded by the splendid species, while Loretta Young is at her prettiest as a young orphan. Add a lost kid, a good doctor, a couple of villains, excellent cinematography and very attractive sets built in sound stages, and you have a magnificent piece of shiny artifice, handled by director Rowland V. Lee, one of those expert and efficient artisans that the ""auteur theory"" overlooked, while paying too much attention to big names. Watch it, you won't regret spending 80 minutes of your life in this Hungarian zoo.",1523059200,,929,4.923566878980892
8647165,5,B00J0MSAFQ,Very contemporary even though it was made in 1933. Loretta Young steals mink stoles left on zoo benches and hides them so women will stop having animals killed to wear mink stoles.,1452988800,,180,4.65625
