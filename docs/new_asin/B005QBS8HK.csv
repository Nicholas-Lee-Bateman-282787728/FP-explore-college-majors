4858157,3,B005QBS8HK,"Sucks for Mona Freeman that she was so often cast to play the teenager that when she tried to cross over into more adult parts, she never did make much headway and ended up relegated to B-pictures. I'll remember her most for her catalyst role in the DEAR RUTH trilogy (DEAR RUTH, DEAR WIFE, and this one, DEAR BRAT). DEAR RUTH and DEAR WIFE are delightful, sparkling comedies. DEAR BRAT, not so much. It lacks the frothy wit of the first two films, and it suffers from the absence of the two romantic leads William Holden and Joan Caulfield. Still, Mona Freeman's busybody antics keep things zipping along.

She's at it again, is Miriam Wilkins, that meddling young meddler. Nowadays, Miriam is busy with the Oakmont College Society for the Rehabilitation of Criminals (of which sole members consist of herself, her boyfriend, and her best friend). Miriam's latest project has her sort of sponsoring recently paroled ex-convict Harry Baxter (Lyle Bettger) who claims he's now on the straight and narrow. This naturally doesn't sit too well with Miriam's senator dad (Edward Arnold), especially since it was he who had sentenced Baxter to prison back when he was a judge. Miriam lands Baxter a job, and imagine her dad's state of apoplexy when he gazes outside his home and sees his new gardener.

DEAR BRAT came out in 1951 and, judged on its own merit, is okay and does here and there elicit some good chuckles. But when put side by side with the first two films, it pales. The writing isn't as sharp. There's a television sitcom feel to this. The comedy in DEAR BRAT is common denominator slaptick, is base mugging. It's farce, but without the grace and cleverness that suffused DEAR RUTH and DEAR WIFE. Sadly, Ruth and Bill Seacroft (Caulfield and Holden's characters) are present only in the off-screen sense, being relegated to conversations over the phone. Further complications arise when Ruth and Bill decide to deploy on a second honeymoon and leave their twin infants in the care of the Wilkins household. That oafish banker Albert Kummer (the easily irritable Billy De Wolfe) is back and, this time, he's even more skeevy. Albert becomes engaged to Miriam, who, may I remind you, is a juvenile, and never mind that this is just one step in Miriam's convoluted machinations. 3 out of 5 stars for DEAR BRAT, a zany and decent enough comedic study in domestic misunderstandings. Plus, a young Natalie Wood has a bit part. Mona Freeman, as ever, is simultaneously aggravating and adorable. Too bad she couldn't parlay those traits into a lucrative acting career when she got older. Still, someday, DEAR BRAT will be available on DVD, and so will DEAR RUTH and DEAR WIFE. On that day, I'll smile all day. I really love this trilogy.",1345939200,4,2738,4.7864693446088795

8483115,2,B005QBS8HK,"This film was available in the early 1960's and reminiscent of the family sit-coms of that time.. It is about the goody-two-shoes well-intentioned daughter of a judge as she dabbles in rehabilitating the ""insensitive and unfeeling"" criminal justice system. The idea of treating a convicted felon as a high school truant, and rehabilitating him to responsible citizenry without first receiving his agreement to do same was quite ludicrous. One begins to feel sorry for the felon (Lyle Bettger). Naive to say the least. Mona Freeman's depiction of the ""brat"" was superficial and irritating. Honest effort by Edward Arnold.",1468540800,,620,5.336734693877551
