7802406,5,5556165920,"Though the video quality is of course old, the tunes are timeless as witnessed by our 2 year-old's undivided attention to them.  He's just starting to try to follow along with songs and rhymes and I catch him humming snatches of these tunes at other times of the day.  He also loves looking at the cover and naming the dwarves, especially Grumpy.  It's very nice that all these Sing Alongs have a variety of song from various movies and not just one.  Our son isn't ready for the souped up, fast-action and frankly too violent modern Disney movies like Cars (full of speed and crashes and outrageous antics), so these are just perfect.  Kind of soft and silly and always clever.",1362441600,,678,4.570247933884297
