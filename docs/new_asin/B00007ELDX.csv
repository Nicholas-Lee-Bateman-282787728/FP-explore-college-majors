7975533,5,B00007ELDX,Maybe you've seen other of my reviews of Naked City.  The stories are first rate.  The actors are...familiar.  Wait'll you see.  The dealer is reliable.  The disc arrived in pristine condition.  Scale of 1 to 10...9.  A 10 is free!  Roberta in Reno,1380844800,,248,4.604651162790698
7975534,4,B00007ELDX,"I am giving this DVD collection four instead of five stars because I don't believe it represents a collection of the strongest episodes from the Naked City TV series. It starts out strong with the excellent ""Death of Princes"" but it is my personal opinion that the following three episodes shy in comparison and are disappointing, especially ""Bit a Diamond"" which I forced myself to watch to the end. Is it worth buying? Yes! And I would buy it again. Just for ""Death of Princes."" The opening episode has one of the greatest opening sequence of all of them. The photography is pure genious. And the simplicity and brevity of the narrator's ""reaching up... reaching out... and reaching down..."" and how it ties in with an equally strong epilogue narration. You just have to see this episode to appreciate one of the most brilliant examples of this TV series.",1072828800,3,857,4.758389261744966
7975535,5,B00007ELDX,I recently purchased this DVD and have viewed all four episodes. I had forgotten how good this series was. I hadn't viewed any re-runs in some twenty years and it was good to re-visit this outstanding series. I heartily recommend this DVD to fans of Naked City. I will probably purchase the other DVD offered in the near future.,1049241600,2,328,4.576271186440678
7975536,5,B00007ELDX,"There are eight million stories in the Naked City and here is your opportunity to view some of the best.  Don't miss watching this series of hard hitting dramas, all filmed in New York City in the late 50's and early 60's!  Many poignant stories that will break your heart or warm it.  Realistic story lines and fantastic acting by many stars who went on to ""make it big."" A New York City that still exists in our memories is the real star of this series. One can only hope that more episodes will be released as they are uniformly incredible.",1044748800,7,543,4.356435643564357
7975537,5,B00007ELDX,"It's great to see that this classic TV police series is being released on DVD.Filmed entirely in New York City,""Naked City""
was a terrific police drama . I remember watching the show in the early 1960's. If aired today, ""Naked City"" would more than hold it's own against the current crop of police shows.
The show was also a training ground for a number of future stars.
Look quickly in the background of some of the shows and you'll see then unknowns like Dustin Hoffman and James Caan. It's also a treat to see areas of New York City as they looked in the early 1960's. Kudos to the folks who are releasing this wonderful show. Don't miss it!",1036972800,2,644,4.420168067226891
