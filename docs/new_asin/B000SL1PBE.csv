Rocky III tells the story of how Rocky rose above from defeat after reclaiming his heavyweight title against Clubber Lang.

Rocky IV tells the story of how Rocky avenged for the death of his friend - Apollo Creed - against Russian boxer Ivan Drago and made Americans proud during the time of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Rocky V has Rocky become a boxing trainer for Tommy Gunn after retiring from the sport and returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where he belongs after losing his fortune to a crooked accountant.

Rocky films are more than just movies for Americans as most of them have become big parts of their life and their culture. The first(Rocky I) provided hope and optimism during the time when Americans were experiencing hardship and difficulties due to the tough economic situation that the country was experiencing during its time of release. The other films may not be a classic compared to the films I have just mentioned in the previous sentence but they still gave us excitement and entertainment as we get to relate to Rocky Balboa when he started a family (Rocky II), rose above from defeat (Rocky III), made us proud being Americans during the Cold War (Rocky IV) and become a mentor to others (Rocky V).

Overall,it was one movie character that would always remain with us for many years to come. A must-own for Italian-speaking Rocky fans.",1414540800,,2117,4.847645429362881
