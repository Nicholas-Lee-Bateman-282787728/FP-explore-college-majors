8162659,5,B000LP5FWW,The final volume of Basilisk: The Koga Ninja Scrolls brings this uber-violent series to a close. If you haven't seen it yet...Get it!!!!!,1397952000,,137,5.0
8162660,4,B000LP5FWW,This of course is the last one of the series so it's just right that it's the last one I found at a great price to complete the collection for my daughters X-mas gift !,1356048000,,168,3.8285714285714287
8162661,5,B000LP5FWW,"Basilisk takes place in 1614 during the Tokugawa Shogunate era. Two ninja clans are at war with each other competing to win the favor of the regime for the next 1000 years. Each clan has to choose 10 members. Whichever clan kills the 10 members of their rival wins.

There are a lot of awesome things to say about this anime. The animation, the music, and the story line are all great. Almost all , of the characters are too. There are a few ninjas I didn't like though. One guy kills you with his hair, one guy is a quadriplegic that kills you with a knife that he holds with his tongue, and one dude turns into goo when he touches salt. Most of the other ninjas are awesome though. The bad guy is really a heartless bastard. It makes it very interesting when you have a bad guy that is way evil. The characters really keep you interested and the carnage never lets up.

I really think anyone that likes anime would get a kick outta this one. If you like it there's a live action movie called Shinobi. It's the same story line with a few less characters. It's incredible as well.

Definitely give Basilisk a look see.",1354060800,,1118,4.289099526066351
8162662,5,B000LP5FWW,"I not only enjoyed the story-telling and animation, but also the soundtrack, so I bought the entire series. I will use some of the series, editing out the rough sex, to augment my Ninja camp this summer for 5th through 9th graders.",1352160000,,231,4.523809523809524
8162663,2,B000LP5FWW,"Everything is about to hit the fan as Saemon's impersonation of Tenzen comes to an end as the REAL Tenzen shows up. Kagero is trailing along, thinking Tenzen is Saemon which could prove to be a fatal error. In addition, Kagero has lied to Gennosuke and told him that she killed Oboro. Of course, Kagero is actually still looking for that oppurtunity and is going to hook up with Saemon in the form of Tenzen to strike the final blow and end the quest for the next shogun. Both Gennosuke and Oboro are still blind but the effects of the poison will soon be wearing off and they might even have to fight each other!

Basilisk was a series that started off with a lot of energy, angst, and passion but over the course of 6 dvds, it gradually became more and more dull. The story was never that interesting, and amplifying this was the fact that the characters weren't either. They all just seemed like automatons who recognized that the whole feud was a senseless waste of time and lives, but they still fought anyway. Nobody just gives up the battle and tries to look for another out from the situation. They all fight just for the pleasure of it, or allow themselves to be manipulated rather easily into killing each other. If any of them had a backbone, they would've tried to assassinate the retired shougun for putting them up to the whole thing. The character of Oboro was the most disgustingly weak of all of them. When she wasn't trying to fend off attempted rapes, the most action she ever took was to mumble ""Gennosuke"" over and over again and cry. To be the leader of a deadly ninja clan, she sure seemed like the stereotypical submissive Japanese woman. As the participants in the war dwindled, so did my interest. The character of Tenzen and his excessive resurrections became comedic, along with his moustache twirling badness. At one point, a samurai, seeing Tenzen beheaded, screams ""Tenzen is dead again!"". I mean the guy just doesn't know when to quit and just served to delay the final confrontation between him and Gennosuke needlessly! The whole series seemed a little drawn past its limits. Basilisk started out good but gradually became banal.",1180915200,,2163,4.6475195822454305
8162664,5,B000LP5FWW,"Is it true that all men are created equal and that no man is born evil?

How could one explain the existence of people like Yakushiji Tenzen?

Volume 6 seems to give us the obvious answered which is to say that between the appalling circumstances surrounding Tenzen's birth and the moment he became (what most will considered) a sadistic person, ""Life Happened!""

A life bitterly affected by man's ego and his cruel tendency to go far beyond the reasonable bounds when it comes to exacting revenge.

Is it surprising that he turned out differently from Oboro (the saint in Basilisk), who was well loved, pampered and sheltered from all of that negativity?

But as it is mentioned in the series: everything is related and co-mingles. Thus, Oboro too was forced to drink from the cup of wrath.

The people behind this anime have created a masterpiece. Their job was somewhat facilitated given the fact that the story is based on true events. This allowed them to add subtleties rarely found in other animated films.

Given much thought, the Law of Retaliation is a sensible law. It would make man think twice before plotting to take a life because an eye was taken.

However, I do not judge someone like Tenzen. He was the product of greater evil.

At the end of the day, ""Everything Shines...""

Ahahahaha!!!",1180396800,,1306,4.738938053097345
8162665,5,B000LP5FWW,"The end to a great series. I enjoy they way the story gets you a little involved with every character. Some times it's hard to determine who is bad and who is good. You'd like to think that the Koga are good and the Iga are bad, but that doesn't always seem to hold true.

I am not happy about one thing though... this series ends.",1175644800,2,331,4.015151515151516
8162666,5,B000LP5FWW,"Great endind to a great story. Go back and get them all. If your into ninja's,swordfighting, and cool special powers for the characters, this is your cup of tea.",1175212800,,161,4.586206896551724
8162667,5,B000LP5FWW,"Like most good series, I was sad to see this series end.  It had a great deal of integrity, with each character being highly individualized.  Unlike most series that have large amounts of violance, the usage of less notable characters as battle fodder is greatly reduced, with each death being final and complete, making you almost wish the series would bring the characters back, you love or hate them that much.  But thankfully the series doesn't, which allows it to keep up the atmosphere that you never know who goes next.  The series' end is tragic and heartfelt, making you feel that it is both sad but necessary.  A truly great series, I would recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in Anime or Ninja.",1169251200,7,721,4.645669291338582
