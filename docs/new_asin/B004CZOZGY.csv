8424125,5,B004CZOZGY,I love this series just like I loved Inspector Morse.  Sergeant Hathaway is a great addition to the cast of characters.  I can't wait to see the later seasons.,1340236800,,159,4.448275862068965
8424126,5,B004CZOZGY,"A bit slow moving when contrasted with some of the other BBC presentations. The plesant atmosphere of the Oxford backdrop sets this series apart from the razzle dazzle London shooting locations. Exciting? No. Worth seeing? I think you'll enjoy it.
The characters play off one another. The viewer gets to see a wee bit of the humanistic non cop side. Interesting story lines.
Avoid any PBS productions. Purchase BBC productions these will give the additional uncut footage as it was intended to be seen.",1328400000,,502,4.988095238095238
8424127,5,B004CZOZGY,"We enjoyed ""Inspector Morse"", and now we found that we liked ""Inspector Lewis"", just as much if not better. It may
simply be that this series is a bit more ""contemporary"" than ""Morse"" was. There are a lot of clever references back
to the older Morse series. We look forward to more of this new series.",1299196800,4,301,4.392857142857143
8424128,5,B004CZOZGY,"This series, which loosely continues the Lewis side of Inspector Morse, is as well written, acted and produced as the original Morse. Kevin Whately as Lewis and newcomer Laurence Fox as Sgt Hathaway work  together beautifully. The plots are complex and the bits of humor between the two men and once in a while between the medical examiner and the guys is perfect. The only complaints I have are that they do not make enough episodes and that there are no extras on the DVDs. I would love some behind the scene stuff and interviews.",1299196800,2,532,4.6
8424129,5,B004CZOZGY,"Absolutely wonderful - terrific acting, writing and beautifully produced. Worth every cent - I enjoy looking at the series over and over.",1297814400,3,137,5.2727272727272725
