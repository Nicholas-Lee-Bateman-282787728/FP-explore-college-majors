8147986,4,B000IZJRTM,"I emphasize Rekha in the title of this review, but the film gives Jaya Pradha equal scope, and both actresses do terrific work. Jeetendra is the man in the middle. He does as well as he can with his part, but his role seems a shade underserved compared to the strength of the womens' roles.

Rekha is an air hostess who has no interest in Jeetendra, who courts her relentlessly. She finally succumbs to his ardor, though, when they meet at the wedding of, respectively, their best friends--Rekha of the bride, Jeetendra the groom. Happy days follow until an unplanned and unexpected evening of drunken conviviality leads to much more. Complications really set in when Jeetendra is called to his dying father's bedside and is asked to fulfill one of those horrific, plot-complicating promises Bollywood film parents are won't to make in the absence of, and without consulting, their children.

Time passes. Rekha weeps-suffering beautifully, as always-and sings amid the snows of Kashmir.

The second half centers around a legal battle, which gives opportunity for exposition on double marriage, the status of women in society at the time, and the status of illegitimate children. As, unfortunately, in too many Hindi films (I watched Anil Kapoor's ""Rishtey"" right after this, and the same thing happened), in the courtroom only the prosecution's side is given, while the defendants' arguments are given either by the defendants themselves in brief, pleading statements, or out of court altogether. This may be dramatically effective, according to the screenwriters and their assessment of audience response . . .  but it offends my desire to see the law accurately and fairly represented, even allowing for some dramatic license.

Things are resolved with the inevitablity of a Greek tragedy. It is not fair, it is not nice, and it isn't just--but it is memorable and dramatically effective.

I don't usually go for social dramas. But I do love to watch Rekha, and I got my money's worth here, and more, because Jaya Pradha was great, too. Seeing the snowscapes of Switzerland standing in for Kashmir was a bonus.",1331510400,,2113,5.040114613180516
