No plot to the movie and there is pretentiousness evolving around Jennifer Tilly, she is okay in other movies but she is no firecracker to keep you awake.

8051000,3,B0007RO8Q8,"Whereas the original ""Child's Play"" (1988) dealt with the character Andy Barclay (and less so with the Chucky character), director Mancini has here taken the character into the direction of metafictional comedy which, though some viewers seem to detest the results, is actually an interesting avenue for this type of film to traverse down. Following in the blood-soaked footsteps of ""Bride of..."", this entry is somewhat about family (dysfunctional, yes) still, but this time we are asked to identify with Chucky as the hero of the story, identifying with his personality traits through some of our own darker (if not always--hopefully!--murderous) imaginings. He is the father figure, the humorous bad guy (bad in taste and in behavior!), but if you love the Chucky character his persona is still on display here to remind you why. While there is too much violence and gore for my taste, this is still quite a funny picture. Oh it's disappointing (I have a friend who apparently hates this film a lot), but for what it set out to do it's actually quite fun on a very perverse level (and, to my mind, more humorous than ""Bride of..."" even). While the original 1988 film was both fascinating and rather sad (due to the complicated psychological thriller-type relationship between Andy and his new doll), this film goes towards the slasher genre path which I will admit I do not prefer as much as I do the psychological elements of the original (we must remember that Chucky was the ""Lakeshore Strangler"" and not a Jason Voorhees kind of guy, but here he is ""one of the greatest slashers in history!"" and I, for one, didn't quite see how we got from point A to point Z so quickly, even though Mancini has totally reinvented the character for this one (obviously). Chucky was the funny character in the first film because he was a violent killer stuck in the body of a cute child's doll, whereas Andy Barclay had to be more mature for his age after discovering the blunt reality of human evil and then could get no one to believe him because he too was stuck inside the body of a little boy. This contrast made for great irony in the original, and that aspect is lacking here. Still, with all the pathos and pointed satire gone, we are left with the tale of a distorted family that takes some pretty strange avenues (yes, there's a masturbation scene with the Chuck!) and some pretty wild moments of gory violence (there is a scene in which a character, ahem, spills his guts) to get to its ultimate destination. Certainly not the hideous atrocity that some critics proclaim, but not as enjoyable or as good as the original Tom Holland-directed film, ""Seed of Chucky"" is clearly more about parody than invention, what with all of the Hollywood and movie-crazy publicity angles used throughout, but nonetheless remains watchable. It seems that with the Andy Barclay character, we had an interesting character relationship involved in the story arc of each of the three original films, but here the Tiffany character becomes the shadow of Chucky instead, asking us to believe in the relationship (both physical and emotional) of these two psychotic but fun-loving spirit-possessed dolls. While I don't mean to belittle Mancini for taking the series in a more comical and parodistic direction, it seems that a great many opportunities were lost. This being said, I have not yet viewed ""Curse of Chucky"", so I can't offer my opinion on that one yet, and maybe that entry will reconnect us to the spirit of the original. In any case, ""Seed of Chucky"" is by no means essential, and it is disappointing on many levels, but if one takes it as a film on its own terms it is actually both funny and freaky. I'm not a big fan of the Glen doll (as I felt that this was merely another attempt to place the world entirely upon the foundation of the dolls which is actually implausible if you've been following the movies thus far) but overall the movie is an interesting stop along the way of Chucky movies. And hey, there's always Jennifer Tilly in case you get bored. C",1413331200,,4054,4.711267605633803
