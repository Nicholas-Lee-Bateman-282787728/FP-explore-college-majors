8447215,5,B000EQ5UZ0,"This seller is very good.  I got the Betterman ""like new,"" and just as it promised, the discs were like new.  The case cover was a little worn, but that's to be expected.  ^-^  Also, it came on the first day for standard USPS shipping.  It's the fastest shipping I've ever had; I highly recommend this seller.",1286496000,,309,4.350877192982456
8447216,3,B000EQ5UZ0,"I'd actually give this anime a 3.5, slightly above average. It is an interesting anime, especially for a little while, but gets a bit predictable. It becomes one of those shows where the heros get themselves into trouble and eventually have to be saved by something much more powerful.

It is, however, a decent show to watch but is probably not for little kids. Maybe kids over 13-15. At least I finished the anime, it kept my slight interest at the very least. Many animes just plain suck and I stop watching after 5-10 episodes. This is an entertaining anime, just not an extraordinary anime that be very memorable, especially to the average anime critic. Action scenes are just okay.

Has a lot of robot action, at least 25% of the anime. If you wanna know what the anime is about go to tv.com or read amazon's summary on it. No use repeating it.",1235865600,3,850,4.512987012987013
8447217,5,B000EQ5UZ0,"When I heard that my friend watched this a while ago, I decided to pick it up and see what it was about. I was reluctant at first, thinking it would be a cheezy knock-off of some anime I've already seen. But at the end of the first episode, I was practically begging for more, pushing the next button for the next episode.

The main plot is that a virus is spreading across the world, known as ""Algernon"". Akamatsu Industries at this time is trying to find a way to stop the virus before it contaminates the entire world (some symptoms you may not pick up on right away)! Keita, the protagonist, is dragged into this conflict by getting himself lost in the Bottom World, where he meets the Betterman, who takes on a form of a dragon after eating a mysterious seed.

I would flush out more of the plot, but then I would be spoiling most of the fun! But I must say, even though the animation was on par with Escaflowne, the storyline just about surpassed Neon Genesis Evangelion (in confusion, that is. Shoot, it sort of has the ending similar to ""End of Evangelion""!). The characters are presented very nicely, the story is incredible, although sometimes confusing, and they don't overexaggerate on the action, which some anime tends to do unintentionally.

If you feel like sparing thirty or so dollars on a fun, cutesy anime with lots of over-sized women anatomies and simple things like that, this anime probably isn't for you. However, if you want to get involved in a story that may change your way of thinking for a couple of days, then I would definately recommend this.

NOTE: You may suffer brain exhaustion by watching this anime in one sitting, take it a couple of episodes at a time!",1189296000,12,1694,4.526143790849673
8447218,5,B000EQ5UZ0,"Where better (no pun intended) to find sci-fi, horror, suspense, and a dash of mecha blended together so well?  Betterman is a worthwhile anime.",1170892800,,144,5.0
