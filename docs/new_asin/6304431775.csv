885500,5,6304431775,"FLIRT is not your typical romantic movie of the 90's (when it was filmed).  But that's what makes it so great.  If you are tired of the ""boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back"" scenario, then you'll like FLIRT.  If not, go rent SHE'S ALL THAT with pretty boy Freddie Prinze, Jr.  And spare me the details, please.
I would also suggest that when viewing this film, you not concentrate on the fact that many of the lines are repeated from one setting to the next (and there are a startling number of lines repeated).  But rather look for the more subtle differences and similarities.
If you are a person who views things with greater depth than ""black and white"", I think you will enjoy this movie.",975369600,5,728,4.402985074626866
885501,4,6304431775,"I thought it was very interesting of how the three stories are somewhat different but the outcome is the same.  It's as they have a connection between each other, even though each story takes place in a different  environment and time all together.  As if they all had a vision of this  event happening, and that's what makes it so intriguing.",963619200,,343,4.573770491803279
885502,4,6304431775,"Hal Hartley is way ahead of his time. This is not his best film, but it's definitely worth watching. I first saw an excerpt in a sociology/religion class which hooked me: advice on love and commitment in a bathroom. This  film  takes chances, and some of them aren't that entertaining, but overall  it's not as bad as elsewhere reviewed on this site.",947462400,4,350,4.612903225806452
885503,4,6304431775,"I find it amusing that people have been lured to watch this film by indy queen Parker Posey.  As all Hal Hartley films tend to be, dialogue and narrative is negated and transformed by repetition and by intentional  ""non-acting"".  I mean, do people really think all the actors are  acting this poorly?  By having the actors not act, the ideas cannot be  discolored by subjective interpretation.  The film strips away traditional  storytelling by repeating it in three forms.  The narrative disappears in  repeating it.  In the three vignettes, nuances in each and differences  between them are what is of primary interest.  The actors are tools for  Hartley's obsession with love, desire, and identity.  This film is a poem.  It is difficult to evaluate Hartley's films without considering the entire  body of work.  It may not be Hartley's most successful effort, but it is an  interesting experiment nonetheless.",945043200,7,913,5.08843537414966
885504,3,6304431775,"I can't belive how many people down right hated this movie.  I thought it was as creative as most Hal Hartley films, and pulled off with a great style and flair to it.  If you think you should go see this simply becaue  Paker Posey's in it, don't waste your time.  She has a very small part in  the beginning, but then she slips into obscurity.  The first two stories,  in New York and in Berlin, are very entertaining.  The Tokyo one bored me  though. (Even though all three are essentially the same story, but then  thats what makes this such an incredibly creative movie!)  This one is  gonna appeal mostly to the indie, artsy fartsy tyes.  Proceed with caution.",938736000,2,665,4.441666666666666
885505,1,6304431775,"I got this movie because Parker Posey was in it, but to my dismay it was only for about 10 seconds.  I was also unaware that this was by the same guy who made that AWFUL movie, Henry Fool.  What can I say?  This movie was  the pits.  The concept was good, but Mr. Hartley is not skilled enough as a  filmmaker to execute it.  Recommendation: don't bother.  A waste of time as  well as a waste of money.",930441600,3,402,3.9873417721518987
7872345,3,6304431775,"This is an anthology of three short films, all written and directed by Hal Hartley. But there's a gimmick. All three films tell the same story, but with a different cast, in a different setting.

The story is about a couple, one of whom wants to know if there's a future for their romance. This is because s/he is traveling to a foreign city, in which her/his former lover lives. So the person being asked is presented in an ultimatum. Commit, or risk losing her/his lover to the former lover in the foreign city.

The person demands 90 minutes to decide, and uses that time to see if another lover (whom s/he likes better) is willing to commit. That other lover likewise has someone else in their lives, a former spouse that they might return to.

The first story with a straight white couple, is set in New York. The lover is traveling to Paris.

The second story, with an interracial gay couple, is set in Berlin. The lover is traveling to New York.

The third story, with an straight interracial couple, is set in Tokyo. The lover is traveling to Los Angeles. (This version features Hal Hartley and his real life wife).

I can't say I loved this film, or was all that entertained by it. I was increasingly bored with each story, as I knew where events were going. I think you have to be a real experiment film buff to love this film.

I find Hal Hartley to be an uneven filmmaker. His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Fool/dp/B0000E5NQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry Fool</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite films of the 1990s. Some of his films I find merely okay. Others I find awful and boring.

Parker Posey only has a few minutes in Flirt. She's one of the stars of Henry Fool. I mention this, because I watch nearly everything Parker Posey. I was disappointed with her small role.",1524441600,,1836,4.787974683544304
7872346,5,6304431775,My introduction to Hal Hartley was seeing the trailer for this film some where deep in the 1990's. I was instantly intrigued. I'm not a good reviewer of films but this is a true masterpiece of real independent cinema.,1473724800,,217,4.589743589743589
7872347,4,6304431775,Watching Hal Hartley cruise the world and fracture his story three times adds some interest to this slight entry in his canon.,1448582400,,126,4.7727272727272725

7872351,4,6304431775,"In this film Hal Hartley tells basically the same story three times over: once in N.Y., once in Berlin, and once in Tokyo. THere are variations in each telling but you might get bored. Part of the third version is done Noh style and I wish Hartley hard done the whole third version that way. That is by far my favorite prt of the film. It is pretty riviting. Hartley is more interested in meta fiction though. we leave the Noh to focus on the actors lives and in places leave the film to focus on the film making. Well if you liked how Borges did this like 70 years ago you might like it in this film too but I think it is a rather tired concept.  SO... I just relish the film for its style and visuals.",1393804800,,703,4.057553956834532
7872352,3,6304431775,Repeative. Heard mixed reviews and decided to give it a chance. Liked the different variations on the theme in difference cultures. Felt likie a Woody Allen work but not sure if it was worth the time spent in the end. Worth a viewing to form your own opinion.,1320710400,,259,4.416666666666667
7872353,5,6304431775,"The movie is on the disc. The movie is a great movie, the same story told thrice through different people and in different languages.
The disc I got came reigon free, meaning it would play on a US player with no modifications. This does not mean they are all reigon free though. Buyer Beware. Also Philips DVD players are moslty quite easy to modify ;)",1184976000,,352,4.430769230769231
7872354,5,6304431775,"Hal Hartley appears to be an acquired taste...  I have only seen 3 of his films so far (this, the flat-out brilliant Trust, and the okay Henry Fool) but he's clearly one of the most underappreciated American directors working today. I think the delivery of his dialogue is what kills it for most people. It's very deliberate and generally not filled with an overkill of emotion. I find this approach allows me to listen to what the characters are actually saying (as opposed to just how they're saying it). That Hartley's one of the few screenwriters with something to actually say really seals the deal.
  I don't want to suggest Flirt lacks emotion though. It manages to pack in more complex emotions that most more histrionic films. In one scene, a man threatens another with a gun, reconciles with him, embraces him, has a change of heart, and shoots him. A woman who witnesses this, hearing some music that begins to play, begins to dance, caught in the moment, slips to the ground, and gets up regaining her sense of reality. This sounds absurdist, and it plays that way in the film. Still, it manages to convey a great deal of human emotions in about a minute without a false note. Hartley is a master at achieving a desired effect.
  Flirt is somewhat experimental in that it replays the same narrative with nearly the same dialogue in three different countries with three different casts. This never felt boring to me, as the intention of some of the lines and the overall outcome of the situation changes each time. What's interesting is that the plot of the episodes is that the character has 90 minutes to make up their mind about whether their relationship has a future. Not coincidentally, the film is 90 minutes long. Clearly Hartley is commenting on the use of art (screenwriting, film direction) to solve personal demons. One feels he is using this film to explore a personal dilemma for himself, a point that is driven home when Hartley himself shows up in the third episode as the possibly spurned lover.
  It's interesting that such an apparent act of directorial vanity never feels like hubris. Hartley manages to make an extremely personal film that actually has something universal to say. He manages to be stylistically bold without being gaudy or excessive. He manages to make the same plot interesting three times. He manages to create a masterpiece in ""Flirt"".",1000944000,11,2387,4.779126213592233
