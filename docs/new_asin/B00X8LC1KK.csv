7166481,1,B00X8LC1KK,Extremely low budget crap.,1469664000,,26,5.75
7166482,5,B00X8LC1KK,Loved the movie. Debbie Rochon was great as always. It had great special effects for a low buget film. Loved the way Jack could swing an axe.,1469145600,,141,4.2592592592592595
7166483,3,B00X8LC1KK,"Only rented this cause I'm a huge Debbie Rochon fan and sadly, she was underused. She's mostly seen in flashbacks. Now the actual movie had some charm, I get what they were trying to do. It has some funny dialog, large body count and a bikini wearing gal with pink/black hair!",1443484800,,276,4.431372549019608
7166484,1,B00X8LC1KK,Wow! This is a bad movie,1478304000,,24,3.1666666666666665

7166486,4,B00X8LC1KK,Interesting concept. Pretty bad special effects.,1475798400,,48,7.166666666666667
7166487,1,B00X8LC1KK,Not worth watching!,1475539200,,19,5.666666666666667
7166488,3,B00X8LC1KK,"There are diamonds buried in the rough. This isn't one of them.

I am about 1/3rd in and find myself needing breaks. The story is about as deep as any Troma feature. The actors seem to have been recruited from friends and family. The dialog is bad and at times barely audible. The special effects are right in line with the previous items.

Why 3 stars? I find myself giggling too this film. It reminds me a lot of what a bunch of 3rd to 5th graders might have put their heads together and made as a Green awareness PSA for a class project and afterward their proud parents tried to make it come to life. The complete lack of polish and horrible effects create a somewhat rugged charm.",1474761600,,685,4.3023255813953485
7166489,1,B00X8LC1KK,"Bonnie and Clyde vs Dracula was terrible.  Evil Bong, all, bad, really bad.  Lumber vs Jack has entered new territory for a rating of negative numbers in all categories.",1474156800,,169,4.793103448275862
7166490,5,B00X8LC1KK,"This movie isn't competing for any Oscars. Take it for what it is--  a funny, campy movie. You can chuckle at the silly special effects and the actors being terrified by the man-eating woods!",1473206400,,191,4.617647058823529
7166491,1,B00X8LC1KK,"Even for low budget sci-fi this was 1 pitiful effort!  Horrible plot & acting, complete waste of time, did not even finish",1472774400,,122,4.545454545454546
7166492,1,B00X8LC1KK,Not good.,1471478400,,9,4.0
7166493,5,B00X8LC1KK,"What a fun, twisted, campy, romp this movie is! More than once I jumped out of my skin while also laughing. It is clever and there are some fantastic bits of dialogue and dark humor. It was made on a low budget, and that's what gives it charm.",1471046400,2,243,4.083333333333333
8715370,5,B00X8LC1KK,"Film-Maker JASON LIQUORI has created a whole new Species of Monster with this Environmentally Based Beast Seeking Domination !
The Unlikely Heroes Determined to save Humanity from this new scourge is Lead by Jason Liquori himself, as 'Jack', the Unemployed Nature Loving  Divorce' Hunting for his Ex-Wife 'Jill' portrayed Perfectly by DEBBIE ROCHON ! I Love how Ms. Rochon remains in a completely Straight Mode despite the Absurdity all around her ; & She's just one of the Dazzling Beauties fighting for Survival !
Lovely Christina Daoust is 'Sheila', the Doubtful Heroine who, along with 'Jill' helped create the Problem ! MICHELLE PRENEZ is Wonderful as the Alluring 'Michelle' who along with her Best Friend 'Jody' jump from one dilemma into the next . Curvaceous & Ulta-Beauteous JENNIFER WENGER is Brilliant Her Dual Role as 'Jody' & the Bikini-Clad Web-Cam Girl 'Carly' !
The Money Hungry & Compassion-Free Villain in this motley assortment of characters is 'Brad', played with delightful exuberance by BREWIER WELCH; & making her Film Debut is the always appealing XENA LIQUORI as the frightened but bold canine, who needs no Voice-Over !

8715372,5,B00X8LC1KK,"This is a campy, fun film.  If you are looking for the best film ever made, go look at Citizen Kane.  If you want an indie film that is campy, fun and nicely put together, this film is your best bet.",1510704000,,199,3.8292682926829267
8715373,3,B00X8LC1KK,"MST3K Worthy, it's a 50's horror picture with the same no budget as flicks like The Horrors of Spider Island or Attack of the Leeches and it's not a lazy attempt making a bad b-movie for the sake of making a bad b-movie, it's actually pretty fun, love the cardboard monsters and costumes and though it's like an Ed Wood killer plant movie, it has some charm.",1509580800,,358,4.358208955223881
8715374,1,B00X8LC1KK,"Sorry...  this movie is just awful.  Not funny.  Not scary.  Not much of anything...  Was this a movie shot as a college senior project or something???  Gah...  even if it was, it's bad...

I normally like B - F rate flicks...  but this one is SO bad that it probably wouldn't even qualify for the guys who do stuff like MST3K...  |

fyi...  this is literally the first 1 star I've ever given on any movie to date...  and I've watched hundreds...",1499212800,,446,4.2926829268292686

8715377,4,B00X8LC1KK,"Production values, acting, writing, editing, sound, music all terrible. Wacky, idiotic story. A true cinematic gem.",1484438400,,115,6.25
8715378,5,B00X8LC1KK,"The special effects in this movie will blow your mind.  At times I thought I was watching a snuff film because the people getting killed by trees were real humans.  The explosions weren't just staged by a pyrotechnic guru either, they were using legit military grade explosives.  If you watch the director's cut version, you'll also find that they didn't even use special effects, they actually found a human killing forest and put together a crack team of soldiers to take out the vile evil trees.  It's a must watch.  I cannot wait for Jack vs. O'Lantern in the epic sequel.",1484352000,3,576,4.663366336633663
