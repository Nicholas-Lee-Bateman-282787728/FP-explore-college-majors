8068002,4,B0009WAEW8,"Yes, A & C continued on TV after their filmed series came to a halt. On TV and in the movies, they never again reached the heights of that first sitcom season, which is really a misnomer - it as no situation, just comedy - something like the best of Seinfeld, over 40 years later.
They continued with The Colgate Comedy Hour, a live variety show, which also featured weekly hosts, like Martin & Lewis, and Jackie Gleason.
This telecast is loaded with talent such as Les Paul and Mary Ford, doing two amazing specialty numbers on Les' musical invention (Mary delivering a sensational rendition of ""I Really Don't Want To Know"", a song which was burning up the charts for Eddy Arnold at the time; later notably done by Elvis Presley, Esther Phillips, among others), and Janik and Arnaut, an astonishing dance act, with the distaff partner performing a ""snake"" dance which defies description. The lady comes close to hypnotizing the viewer, as she does impossible, yet graceful and rhythmic contortions to music.
It's important that these supporting acts do so well, because Bud and Lou get mired in some very tedious slapstick in their finale. Although once you start to dissect the materail with coulda(s) and shoulda(s), you're not in the spirit.
Despite Lou being in lower gear, it was said that he had recovered from an illness, the opening bits are very good. In this show, they start out as newlyweds following a double-ceremony, and immediately have a run-in with a kid who has watched too many TV westerns. The young actor keeps up with the duo in a funny routine.
Next we find out that one of the boys' wives is due...but in typical A & C fashion, there's so much commotion, that it's hard to tell which one. The payoff has punch, thanks to good writing.
The VHS tape has reasonable video quality, considering the kinescope source, but the sound is substandard even for such a transfer. It's difficult to understand the stars, whose throats aren't in the best shape.",1203724800,,1973,4.721739130434782
