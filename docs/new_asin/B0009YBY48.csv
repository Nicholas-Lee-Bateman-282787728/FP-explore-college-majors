8070435,1,B0009YBY48,The subtitles don't work so this was a waste of time and money.,1464307200,,63,3.923076923076923
8070436,5,B0009YBY48,"The story of one of the greatest Hungarians ever - Istvan Szechenyi. Statesman. Intellectual. Engineer. Leader. These are just some words to describe a man who was truly a Huomo Universalis.

With the biggest budget ever for a Hungarian film, including F/X made in Hollywood, this is a sweeping epic that covers one of the most turbulent times in history - Hungary's struggle against the Habsburgs and the formation of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

Excellent biographical details, sweeping epic plot - this is a must see for any fans of historical dramas and anyone interested in European history.

Also of note, the grand performance of Karoly Eperjes as Szechenyi. Due to commie politics in Hungary, this film was panned by the critics (ie the gov't censors) but in any normal circumstances it would have been a Oscar-winning type film.",1282348800,,838,5.057971014492754
8070437,5,B0009YBY48,"I think this is a beautiful story about a man, who wanted to change his country. He was not looking for his lost money, he wanted a new Hungary. The story about a great man, love through peace, war and blood. A great story from the hungarian history. Everyone, who like dramas, the 19th century, real heros... have to see this wonderful movie.",1122854400,,343,4.4603174603174605
8070438,4,B0009YBY48,"Hidember is the most expensive Hungarian film ever made, and this can be seen on the quality of the movie. The subjest of the movie is the life of Istvan Szechenyi, who established the Hungarian Academy of Science, made the first bridge on the DUNA river in Budapest and contributed additionally big sums to the development of Hungary in the XIX. century. At the end of hid life he was murdered by agents of the Habsburg family, as at this time Hungary was part of the Habsburg empire. At the time of filming the production was strongly supported by the Hungarian government, therefore crictics came in big waves from the opposition. (The celebrations for the 1100 (!) years of the existence of the Hungraian State took place in 1996, and had nothing to do with this film.)",1122854400,,773,4.649635036496351
8070439,5,B0009YBY48,"This is a fascinating historical drama about the extraordinary life of Hungary's greatest nobleman, Count Szechenyi. This was the most expensive Hungarian film ever made prior to ""Faithless"" (2005), and it really shows on the production; the sets are great and the rare cgi scenes are also very well done. While most people don't know much about Hungarian actors, outside of their native land, the ones cast in this film are all remarkably talented. Karoly Eperjes' leading performance is absolutely mesmerizing, he gets absorbed into his character so much. Even if you don't understand Hungarian and have to switch on the English subtitles, you will still enjoy his performance, which is so passionate. Eperjes is the Hungarian Garry Oldman, his performances are always fascinating to watch regardless of the subject matter. This is an outstanding film, well worth the 20 bucks.",1122681600,3,879,5.24113475177305
