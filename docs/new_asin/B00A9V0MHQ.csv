8548756,1,B00A9V0MHQ,I agree with the 1st review. I have a home theater system that I can get any CD/DVD to sound good even the old ones or low recorded ones. The guitarists are most of the band but you can't hear them no matter how you adjust it. I'm disappointed that molly hatchet even released it.,1365292800,5,280,4.109090909090909
8548757,2,B00A9V0MHQ,"I like listening to Molly Hatchet so I thought it would be cool to see them in concert, but I was very disappointed. The video quality is ok, but the audio was just terrible. The lead guitar, which keeps the songs fluid, was barely audible. Even when he was obviously doing a screaming solo, you can't hear it at all. The camera work was average, although frustrating to hear a keyboard solo but be watching the drummer. The camera angles were pretty lame too. All in all, if this was a 70's bootleg video, it would be about right, but it was recorded in 1996 so the results are unacceptable. If you're a Hatchet fan, save your money and stick with audio.",1363478400,9,655,4.377049180327869
