4571061,5,B005521YVW,"This movie was a cute little comedy that was clean and funny. I thought the acting was pretty good and that the chemistry between the characters was nice.
It was a fairly typical romance with a little twist. Not a amazingly unique movie,but very good none-the-less.",1345075200,,265,4.782608695652174
4571062,4,B005521YVW,"This little charmer is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy, complete with wacky sidekicks.  A budding artist girl meets an art-challenged boy in a college art appreciation class.  The girl already has another boy, seemingly perfect, but he isn't what he seems (the twist).  The leads are attractively played, the supporting cast characterful, if occasionally a bit over-the-top.  Better production values than expected for a made-for-TV movie, set mainly in college, a Border's Bookstore, various art venues, and a few living spaces, with nothing stronger than a swear word, a little beer, and a kiss.  If you like the genre, and Disney, it's nicely done.

4571063,5,B005521YVW,This movie is cute if you like chick flicks! Its funny as well-especially the guy that used to play in Boy Meets World! Good show for all.

4571066,4,B005521YVW,"This is a looney little chick flick that is sure to amuse, if you are willing to suspend reality for a while! The whole imaginary boyfriend thing was just a tad silly, but still well-done for what it was. The cast was very good, as was the music. If you're looking for some good fun to pass the time or merely blow off the stress of the day, Love Surreal could be for you!",1497571200,,372,4.04054054054054
4571067,5,B005521YVW,"I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, it was a bit odd that Abby is twenty something and still has an imaginary friend. I thought the character Cal was very odd and very funny. It's was a nice movie to relax with.",1497052800,,209,4.121951219512195

4571072,4,B005521YVW,"Directed by Ryan Little (Saints and Soldiers series), this film has a touch of the... surreal. It took me a few scenes to realize that Sy (Orlando Seale) was all in Abby's head (Shiri Appleby). But once that part is established, it is quite interesting to see how Abby copes with the loneliness and abandonment issues from childhood as an adult. So many grown-ups today act in ""illogical"" ways because of what they have gone through... this movie just portrays a little more extreme case than most. But it makes a good point. And in the end, love and healing save the day.
So, overall, a cute little movie with several absolutely hilarious laugh aloud moments between Quinn (Nick Zano) and Calvin (Will Friedle).",1480032000,3,712,4.75

4571086,3,B005521YVW,"The artifice of presenting ghosts of decedents and imaginary friends as visible is already starting to get stale after only a few samples of it in my ultra recently newfound willingness to watch moo bees after decades of avoiding Wholly Weird imagery (no telebitchin at all since 2003, very little even before that, and no theater movies at all since early childhood).  Having lived more than 70 years entirely in the real world without guidance from the imaginations of Wholly Weird, this moo bee seemed especially strange.  But the foreshadowing of the solitary snow angel was helpful for understanding the imaginary nature of ""Sy"" as was the title reference to ""Surreal""  It is especially hard to believe that the standard homosexual regimentation and ""let's pretend this is socialization"" efforts of years of ""school"" administrators even could have allowed the existence of a twenty something college level student such as Abby.  The pretense of ""imaginary versus real"" simply doesn't wash beyond the pretenses of Wholly Wierd.  Given that one sided (lead female only, never involving the audience) fictional ""lead"" character, only the quality of acting, photography, and production maintained this fantasy film at a three star rating.",1468195200,,1239,5.301020408163265

4571110,4,B005521YVW,"The movie has an unconventional premise: To cope with the loneliness caused by absentee parents in her childhood, Abby (Shiri Appleby) turns to art and creates an imaginary friend, Sy (Orlando Seale). Fast forward from 5-year-old Abby to college Abby. She's an art student, and Sy is still her escape.  Enter Quinn (Nick Zano), who is stuck taking an art appreciation class he finds boring, but has to pass. Abby ends up having to tutor him, although she believes he's a jerk and unteachable.

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH MAY BE A SPOILER (IT DESCRIBES THE CONFLICT IN THE MOVIE):

Quinn and Abby spend a lot of time together, prompting Sy to vie for more of Abby's attention. Quinn feels ambivalent because he thinks Sy is a real person. Abby's not ready to let go of her safety net.

END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER

I agree with the reviewer who called it a ""by the numbers"" rom com, which I wanted. It's a really sweet movie, very clean, with no cursing, nudity, or sex scenes. It's a fairly typical chick flick/romantic comedy. The cast had great chemistry, the writing was decent, and the production value was better than expected. I would definitely watch this again. The premise of Sy could have easily been weird or creepy, but I thought they did a great job making it feel believable, or at least understandable.

I also loved getting to see Will Friedle (Eric from Boy Meets World). He played the wacky, Canadian roommate and was a fun addition to the movie.",1436832000,4,1457,4.671875

4571114,1,B005521YVW,"Shiri Appleby is an actress I like quite a bit, but this movie was really a disaster.

This is an appealing love story that I rate above average on the Hallmark-type movie scale.
I especially loved the soundtrack. So much so that I bought it.
Good acting.
Yes the plot is silly but it's not trying to be anything else.
The parents & roommate Calvin are over the top & almost ruin the movie but thankfully they aren't a big part of the movie.
