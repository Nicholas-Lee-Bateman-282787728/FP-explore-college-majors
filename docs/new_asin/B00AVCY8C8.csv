This documentary reveals everyday life to an embarrassing level. It deals with common ""Blandville"" reality, the disgusting truth behind glorious online recognition. It may as well be common sense that video games turn generations into fat serial killer and people are ""working at minimum wage in a job they hate to buy a bunch of s*** they don't need"". Insanity almost becomes desirable. Life is hard. Brain sucking work for about 15 movies a week - let alone those mornings you wake up realizing an extraordinary amount of money charged to your credit card for DVD's you can't watch because you are at farkin' work.

By the time you are half way through you should realize the pleasure of cynicism behind them spoken words. This is exactly what makes this 'documentary' a treat for those who are still here - watching their thoughts turning up on screen. That what looks stupid, bad acted, offensive or simply mad is sweet revenge from the creator to mainstream parody. It is the excitement raised by one who seems to appear as a fowl stain on the social fabric to produce shocking movie cult in a world that is far away from being 'fake'. Back to individualism ""with f***ing hearts and minds"".

It's even more than just that. For low dollar you'll get nothing less than the somewhat 'lost trailer' by the great Joe D'Amato; wisdom by Oscar Wilde, Ed Gein, John Carpenter and the likes; listed B classics and maybe some Titty references (but don't quote me on that).

Growers around Taber claim it's the sweetest corn in the world. Watch Taber Corn and see whether you dig it.",1361577600,,1814,4.673981191222571

There are those who get it, and those who don't. If you're a diehard movie geek familiar with names like Enzo Castellari, Jack Hill, Bruno Mattei, and Joel M. Reed, this will be right up your alley. If you've ever watched a DVD or Blu-Ray unboxing video on You Tube and wondered what kind of person makes such videos, all will be revealed. If you ever read about Ilsa versus Bruce Lee in the Devil's Triangle in The Psychotronic Video Guide and wanted to know more, this will also be revealed. Taber Corn is for the fanboy in all of us...",1361404800,,683,4.652892561983471
