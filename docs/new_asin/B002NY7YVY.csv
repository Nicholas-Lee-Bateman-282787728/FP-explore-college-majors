3960667,5,B002NY7YVY,"Besides Wozzeck, this has to be the creepiest and scariest opera I've ever seen. The music is haunting and beautiful, and the singing superb. Even my teenage kids were captivated from start to finish.",1372550400,10,200,4.911764705882353
3960668,5,B002NY7YVY,"(I'm assuming if you're reading this, you're familiar with this opera - possibly via the other DVD version that's currently on the market. This review is written for such people. If you have never heard this opera, stop reading NOW and click ""Add to cart."" Just do it, you won't regret it. And/or purchase the CD featuring Christa Ludwig as Judith. Or, if you like, check out the other movie version directed by Szinetar. It's all good.)

I was originally skeptical and hesitant to purchase this DVD because there were no reviews here and very little representation on Youtube. My love of Bartok's work won out, though, and I am glad it did. This is a worthy interpretation of this phenomenal piece that manages to flesh out the score and libretto while coloring it with valid insights and personal touches.

THE CAST - Robert Lloyd is a treasure as Bluebeard. His acting is a little wooden, but his voice is strong and he manages to bring a little more character to the role than many baritones. This is a Bluebeard who is just as affected by what Judith uncovers as she is. Elizabeth Laurence does not have the strong voice we're used to, but her high, lilting soprano infuses Judith with a kind of excitability, naivety and joy that supplants the redundant shrewishness of other interpretations. Usually, I feel pretty fed up with Judith by the end of the opera, but here, I really felt for her. Laurence has the acting chops to pull this subtlety-laden Judith off.

THE PRODUCTION - GORGEOUS scenery, understated but lovely costumes, inspired directorial choices, and well-placed transitions. The production really works with the music, and the two aspects really feel seamless. In short, I believe Bartok would have approved. This opera is really well-suited to the film medium in a way that most other operas aren't. If you don't believe me, just check out Door 6. There are some ""weird"" parts that feel a little jarring, but a little bit of reflection made me appreciate the genius behind these decisions, and I didn't think they strayed enough from the music or the libretto to detract from the experience.

THE ORCHESTRA - This might be my least favorite aspect of the film, but it is by no means weak. I just have my own preferences regarding tempi, and in certain places (Door 5 comes to mind) I feel the dramatic tension was weakened by the conductor's choices. Others will probably find it more to their taste.

OVERALL - Just buy it. I know you will come back to it the same way that I will if you love this opera. I'm tempted to make comparisons with Szinetar's film, but the two are just too different. I haven't made my mind up if I like one more than the other. They each have their strengths and weaknesses, but I think a sensitive and open-minded person will be able to appreciate both films whatever their own preferences and prejudices.",1271289600,43,2858,4.685258964143427
8375677,5,B002NY7YVY,"This is an outstanding filmed realization of Bartk's profound and haunting one-act opera. The two soloists have their characters, and their interaction, honed to the finest degree, and the director's inventions for the seven doors are breathtaking. The alternative Hungarian version is inferior in every respect, from set to singing to acting. This is the one to go for",1491091200,,369,5.271186440677966
8375678,3,B002NY7YVY,Bad quality. This is one my favorites opera. Is a shame there is no an actual version (like Valery Gergiev in the Met in 2015) on Amazon.,1484870400,,137,4.111111111111111

8375680,5,B002NY7YVY,"I find Bluebeard's Castle a grim short opera, but quite an interesting one; and this production seemed to me, if not THE definitive one, at least one potentally definitive interpretation, filled with visual symbolism. An excellent and thought-provoking show..",1428364800,,259,5.666666666666667
8375681,5,B002NY7YVY,"Lovely music.  Very enjoyable.
I was especially happy to get to buy this because the retirement home I'm staying in went to a showing of two one-act operas, but didn't stay for this one, which I wanted to see,",1426982400,,209,4.358974358974359
8375682,5,B002NY7YVY,This seldom performed Opera is a must for any home collection.  It is a short opera and lends itself to an evening of enjoyment when there is a time element.,1417392000,,157,4.233333333333333
8375683,5,B002NY7YVY,"Very satisfying performance visually and vocally of this powerful opera.  A standard interpretation of of the blood is that it is that of others; however, consider the interpretation that it is Bluebeard's own blood.",1416096000,,216,5.352941176470588
8375684,4,B002NY7YVY,"I loved this literal, fairytale production, but I am one who believes great works can best impress when performed as written.  The performance mmatches the music - psychodrama at its best.  My companion said, ""it is movie music,"" not realizing that this is where movies got their music.",1414022400,,286,4.9375
8375685,5,B002NY7YVY,"What can I say?  Scary superb.  Lloyd and Lawrence are a formidable team, the staging (or setting) is phenomenal, the music is out of this world.  Philip Glass (whose latest farrago I have just  reviewed) could learn what true minimalism  means by leaving ""Bruckner"" and listening to Bartok.  Just hit the button and BUY IT!",1411516800,,324,4.8
8375686,4,B002NY7YVY,"This version of Bluebeard, music by Bartok and text by Bla Balzs, turns the story into a kind of journey by train: looking out one side, we see and hear an engaging psychological study of the victim and victimiser, but if we look to the other side, an entirely different landscape, rising above mere psychology to a series of emblems and constructions that reveal the myths within which we live. Powerful, heady stuff, with both score and text worthy of the subject.

The Orchestra and singers are both superb, though the recording is a bit not - not bothersome unless you want the volume very low. Robert Lloyd and Judith Laurence are far from the usual wooden acting associated with opera. Their singing is engaging and believable.

An older performance of this opera, with the same orchestra, but under the baton of Georg Solti is also available on DVD. I think this version is superior, if only because this staging is better suited for filming, and the acting far more natural. The Solti production is ill costumed (think the Star War's bar scene) and features the wooden acting I mentioned above.",1394323200,6,1102,4.7643979057591626
