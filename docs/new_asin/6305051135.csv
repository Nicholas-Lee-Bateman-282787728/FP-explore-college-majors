958648,5,6305051135,"""Wide Awake"" has everything to make a movie experience worthwhile. It amazes me that it received so little publicity; the acting is superb, the story is engrossing. It is not a ""feel good""  movie, it is one which asks you to think, to use your mind as well as your  heart. So few movies these days have any substance to them, and then one  like this comes along to make you realize just how good a motion picture  can be. If the major studios would make movies like this, what a joy it  would be!",931392000,2,496,4.178947368421053
958649,5,6305051135,"The label ""family film"" sends most people running in all directions, except towards the box office. This seems to be the unfortunate and undeserved fate of Wide Awake, a small gem. This is a true ""family  film"" in that it is not just a substitute babysitter for a couple of  hours, during which the parents can doze off. It's a film that a parent  will enjoy discussing with his/her children, because it raises some very  important issues -- dealing with the death of a loved one, faith, the  search for God -- but does so from the perspective of a 10-year-old boy.  The film is remarkable on several counts, perhaps the most important of  which is the fact that the screeenplay never condescends to its young hero.  Joshua is dealing with problems that are very real to him, and the film  refuses to make light of them, simply because he is only ten. Another very  nice touch is the avoidance of portraying the adults as black-and-white  caracatures. And the nuns and priest at Josh's Catholic school are not the  dogmatic cardboard characters one often sees in films. Both Rosie O'  Donnell's nun and Dan Luria's priest are aware that there are no simple  answers for the issues which are troubling Josh; as adults they know that  one must move on after the death of a loved one, but they are also aware  that this is not so easy for a young boy or girl. The film contains a  number of wonderful moments involving Josh, his friends, and his  schoolmates.  One of the most moving is when Josh is called before the  class to recap what he has learned during the year.  It is during this  speech that we learn where the title, ""Wide Awake"", comes from:  it describes that bittersweet transition from innocence to the road to  maturity.",925430400,6,1734,4.555194805194805

Joshua is a ten  year old boy who has just lost his grandfather and is doubting the  existence of God. In his mission to find God in order to ask about his  grandfather, Joshua learns about the lessons of life and how to become a  better human being. Finally, when all hope is lost, Joshua finds God in the  last place he ever expected to look. Joseph Cross gives and excellent  performance as Joshua and Rosie O' Donnell is as brilliant as always. If  society were more intertested in movies like these, instead of action  movies with special effects, we would all try to look for the good in  people and maybe find ourselves as Joshua did.

958706,4,6305051135,"This is the story of ten-year-old Joshua who is left lonely and full of questions when his beloved grandfather dies.

This is a very sweet story, and I loved it.

There was just one scene that bothered me.  I love Rosie O'Donnell (which is why I chose to watch this movie) and she plays a nun teaching the little boys in religion class. Joshua asks a question about what they have been studying ... he says that the bible says that you will go to hell if you are not baptized, and he (and several other boys in the class) are worried about the people that they know who have not been baptized, whether they are going to hell.  Rosie says that no one is going to hell.  Joshua asks if the bible, therefore, is lying to us by saying that you will go to hell if you are not baptized.  Rosie says that this question will be discussed in the next class.  And... the movie just drops it. The movie should have continued answering this question, or it never should have brought it up.

958763,4,6305051135,"If you are a family film lover like me, then you'll love ""Wide Awake."" It's a wonderful family film that deals sensitively, and even with humor, with a fairly unusual situation for the screen: a 9-year-old's struggles with his faith in God.

In this movie a young boy learns lessons about life and God during a trying year of discovery in fifth grade at a Catholic boys' school. As the school year opens, Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross) is sad over the recent death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia) . On his first day at school, Joshua is harassed by the class bully. Because his grandfather played football, Joshua tries out for the school team, over the objections of his parents (Dana Delaney and Denis Leary), two physicians who don't like the risk of injury. But Joshua is not very athletic and does not make the team. Joshua continues to seek answers from God about his grandfather, so his teacher, Sister Terry (Rosie O'Donnell) advises him to approach a cardinal who is coming to visit the nearby girls' school. Joshua meets a young girl at the school and falls for her. As the year goes by, Joshua continues his quest for spiritual answers and finds them in unexpected places, such as a winter snowstorm.

The main characters are Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross), Mrs. Beal (Dana Delany), Sister Terry  (Rosie O'Donnell), Neena Beal (Julia Stiles), grandfather Beal (Robert Loggia) and Mr. Beal  (Denis Leary).

I like this movie because of that way that it is structured, meaning the way that it is put together, the characters seem as if they already knew each other for a very long time.

I would recommend this movie to kids age 5 to 12 but, it's really a family movie that parents would enjoy as well. I give this movie 4  out of 5 stars because some of the music doesn't go well with the scenes.

It's a story of a boy's awakening to his spirtual side and his quest to find meaning in a confusing world. He faces mockery from some and kindness from unexpected sources and, in the end, finds himself 'wide awake' for the first time.

So is this a story of a spiritual seeking or simply a metaphor for the journey we all take as we come of age? The beauty of this movie is you don't need to choose. You get two stories for the price of one.

Not your typical M Night fare here. True, there is still the element of the 'supernatural' as seems to be true of all his films, be this one is definitely not a thriller or suspense flick, as most of his others are.

Although I am closer to the age of Joshua's grandfather, it conjures up memories of a youthful search and more than a little disappointment to learn how things really are.  Other reviews have covered the material.  I believe this movie should never have been advertised as a comedy, although it does have humor.  It is tasteful and should be offensive to no one.  However, the advertising does a disservice to the young character Joshua.  He is altogether serious in his quest.  By the end he has learned the challenges of life and ""knowing"", not just about the existence of God, but the problems and discouragements of living.  Finally, in spite of the challenges, hard knocks, disappointments, and doubt, there was someone watching out for him.  Although the final scene is a bit over the top, it occurs to me that it is a wonderful use of symbolism, a tool of mankind to understand his own spirit.  We are always being watched and cared for, even when we aren't paying attention.",1161388800,4,1034,4.662983425414365
958839,5,6305051135,"Wide Awake will be a very pleasant surprise for fans of Shyamalan's more recent movies; this is one of his best.  Even if you're not a Shyamalan fan, look this one up; other than a very strong story, it has no connection to Shyamalan's horror movies.  This is a funny-serious, Christian-themed family movie.  Many stereotypes about Catholic education are used, but these are done in a light-hearted manner, one might say lovingly; the positives of a Catholic education can be discerned right along with the stereotypically bad.  Religious questions are presented in ways that should not offend.

Joseph Cross carries this movie in the lead as the 11 yr old Joshua, who is struggling with the passing away of his beloved grandfather.  Joshua decides to go on a mission:  being enrolled in a strict Catholic school, and having strong religious memories with his grandfather, Joshua decides he needs to talk directly with God about his grandfather's passing.  The mission is to figure out how to get God to agree to this.  Not surprisingly, Shyamalan's story is very strong.  More surprising are the many funny scenes involving school hi-jinks, along the lines of many lesser kids' movies.  Shyamalan smartly keeps these under control; they are not overdone or screechy, and not surprisingly, are a lot more fun and memorable than the usual fare.  These are mixed in with many serious scenes that carry meaning for young and old alike.

Although Cross and the story carry the movie, they are buttressed by many other fine performances.  Rosie O'Donnell as a nun, Dennis O'Leary and Dana Delany as Joshua's parents, and Robert Loggia as the grandfather are excellent in providing a solid and caring adult base for Joshua.  There is a great cadre of child actors surrounding Cross, led by Timothy Reifsynder as Joshua's best friend.

The final resolution to the movie is a bit too supernatural for my tastes.  Even so, everything leading up to that ending, especially Rosie's school-ending commentary and Joshua's ""Wide Awake"" speech, both recapping the movie, are excellent.  Highly recommended.",1155427200,4,2091,5.064327485380117

Yes, I buy fleas. You got a problem with that? Anyway, true to the style of Mortimer's distinctive oeuvre, the movie is crafted around a clever genre conceit which is carefully hidden away behind the seemingly mundane plot line and then hinted at throughout with lots of arty little boluses of symbolism, foreshadowing, subtext, and big red neon signs that flash on and off in Morse code for no apparent reason.

I think this movie is pretty hard to find, so I'm revealing the ending below the line of hyphens that is below this paragraph...

958892,4,6305051135,"""Wide Awake"" is a pleasant surprise, indeed.  This is a film that grapples with mature themes, predominantly crisises of faith, not often seen in a major film production.  The main thread to this film involves a 10 year-old boy, Joshua Beal(Joseph Cross) who is grieving the loss of his grandfather(Robert Loggia) and is seeking answers from his peers and his adult associations.  M. Night Shyamalan has proven in his subsequent work that he is an expert director of children and this film is no exception.  Cross feels like a genuine child grappling with feelings unknown beforehand and not some Hollywood stereotype of what a 10 year-old boy is.  The adults in the film are strong archetypes and not buffoons as a lot of them are in films centered around children.  Shyamalan should go back to this film as a reference point in good filmmaking.  I have contended for years that as great a film as ""The Sixth Sense"" was it was a blessing and a curse because since then he has been trying to catch lightning in a bottle.  This film demonstrates that great movies start with great stories.  On a note of trivia, the blue Phillies cap that Rosie O'Donnell wears in the film was used by the team in 1994 during day games.  The cap was dropped by the team because the players thought it was bad luck because they lost all but one game in which they wore it.",1108944000,9,1353,4.553719008264463
958893,3,6305051135,"Well, as my title for this piece would suggest, I'm unsure what I think of this movie.

First of all, a lot of other reviewer's of this film have focused a bit on the Christian focus of this movie, which yes, it does have.

I should say too, that I am a practicing Christian, so I'm cool with that but...

It's just a tough movie to relate to, because it's a little too heavy / thought provoking for a kid's movie, while the main character is a kid.  And it's too much of a kid character centred to be a grown-up's movie.

It's been a while since I was that young, and my kid's are at least 10 years of that age, and I can't remember thinking this deeply at that age.

I like Shyamalan, I bought this desperate for more Shyamalan after I got back from the cinema seeing ""The Village"" (Excellent movie, 5 stars, review pending...) and you can't get this DVD in Australia, so I bought it.

I've watched it twice, and I don't know, maybe I need to watch it again.  Like I said to another Shyamalan fan at church, it almost plays like one of those old ""live action"" Disney movies, and I've got to say the transfer on DVD makes the movie look a lot older than it is, if you watch the trailer (the only ""special feature"" on the disc) you'd swear you were just about to watch a movie from the 70's.

The tag-line on the cover says ""Rosie O'Donnell is Hilarious"", I definately missed something, I think she's only in the movie for all of 20-25 mins, and she has been funnier.

Another reason I got this DVD was the cast sounded flawless, Rosie O'Donnell (A League of their Own), Dana Delaney (TV's China Beach), Denis O'Leary (The Sandlot, A Bug's Life), even Julia Stiles (for about 10 mins as Josh's sister) and directed by M. Night Shyamalan - how could you go wrong?

Anyway, I've given it 3 stars for the following reasons:

1. The quest for God IS important.

2. It DOES have some touching moments.

3. It DOES have the Shyamalan twist.

Recommendation: Maybe rent the movie first.",1104969600,7,1979,4.3108108108108105

I use to be a Catholic (no religion now) and did not attend Catholic school, but everyone heard the stories. This school experience (in the movie) seemed not that bad (positive actually) and even loving but also comical at times. The story was done very well and poses some interesting questions and has some equally interesting answers. The main character seems to be a precocious child but soon one also gets a glimpse of a higher consciousness and desire to know God that most adults haven't acquired. The boy searches to contact God in order to find out how his grandfather is. There are many well known actors in support roles which adds to the interest of the movie and I was quite surprised by the quality of the acting and the script even for the supporting characters. There was nice seemless flow throughout the entire movie which made one lose track of time, and then come away with even a more renewed belief of God and ITs many ways.

I am not sure why some reviewers lament that it's a pretentious theme. Sure, it's not anything that'd be seen rocking boxoffice records or winning grand prizes, it even has some necessary contrivances. But it moved me, impelled me to think, and impressed me with a number of brilliant moments that are sensitive and engaging without becoming cloying.
Shyamalan is now a familiar name, so I approached his debut effort with high expectations, and while it could be sappy in bits for some people, I'm guilty of  having clung on until the very last shot. The writing is taut and the production values are all-round immaculate. I was not disappointed one bit!
If you have kids, this is a fantastic movie to watch because of the sweet yet universal messages it couches. Plus, the kids in the movie are not freckled 10-year old brats, they have thoughts deeper than what you and I give them credit for.
The script is by no stretch of imagination an overly ambitious one, but I highly recommend this underrated gem for its thoughtful dialogue and crisp direction.",1088899200,28,1295,4.581896551724138

958899,5,6305051135,"I'm editing, or more to the point, re-writing my previous review of this movie. When I first wrote my review, I was 23, I'd been raised Roman Catholic, and still believed some of the Roman Catholic doctrine.

Today, I'm a born-again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, and as such, I can hardly watch a movie without praying for the salvation of the cast and crew of said movie (and I hope Robert Loggia was right with the Lord when he passed away).

Now my review:

Wide Awake is a movie about a ten year old boy named Joshua A. Beal (Joseph Cross), a broken-hearted child whose grandpa (Robert Loggia) passed away due to an illness. Josh undertakes to find out if his grandpa is okay. He and his grandpa were very close, and by human nature, Josh labors to learn about God, and whether his grandpa whom he loves very deeply, is okay.

During the school year, Josh grows up a great deal, also learning about befriending the person whom nobody else wants anything to do with.

If you genuinely desire to know more about God, I would strongly recommend getting a Holy Bible and prayerfully studying it. And as I once heard Justin Peters say:

""If you would like to hear God speak to you, read His word. If you would like to hear Him speak to you audibly, read it out loud.""",1051315200,7,1271,4.3872340425531915
958979,4,6305051135,"This is one of those films that you will pass right by.  I did, for months; the film was in my libray's DVD collection and I gave it nary a glance.
Until I realized who the director was.
M. Night Shyamalan has quickly become one of my favorite writer/directors.  His films have deep religious themes of faith, hope, and redemption.  Unlike 95% of Hollywood fare - in which film is hung on nothing (thematically empty) - Shyamalan's work uses the ghost story, the comic book superhero, and alien visitation (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"") as frameworks for his message of redemtpion - his search for God.
So, after finding that ""Wide Awake"" is the Shymalan film that immediately preceeded ""The Sixth Sense"", I watched it.  I honestly must say I was not expecting much, just some faltering steps by a young filmmaker on the rise.
But, I was very pleasantly surprised by the depth and maturity of this film!  Shymalan understands that the most profound themes are communicated through the smallest events.  This film abounds with cherished meaning, those bright mileposts on the road of childhood that point to maturity.
Young Joshua's search for God is successful, but not in the way he expected.
This film, despite a somewhat silly encounter in the very last scene, is a triumph of understatement and beauty.  It is a tender gem that will more than likely remain hidden in the stacks.
I hope you discover it, like we have, and will cherish it forever.",1049328000,10,1462,4.800796812749004
958980,4,6305051135,"It is a surprise to me that young Joseph Cross has not gone on to greater things as a hollywood actor.  In this film he once again puts the adults to shame with his natural acting skills as he did in the film Jack Frost (1998).  But now Joseph is getting back into acting in the American TV show ""The O'keefes"" in 2002/2003 and I hope that he may do another movie as an eigteen year old to see how his acting skills hav developed since he was ten years old.  The film looks at the transaction from boy to man or girl to woman and how hard it is for kids to make that move. With issues such as death and the dissapearence of that ""magic"" as Josephs character Joshua describes it during the movie.  From a world of creativity and unrestricted boudaries to just seeing the plastic and paint in a toy car.  Th film also raises the issue of how we should allow children to handle the death of a loved one  as Joshua has to manage when his grandpa dies of bone marrow cancer.  It is shown that we shouldn't hide the facts of death from our childrebut discuss it openly and allow them to say their final goodbyes by allowing them t attend the funeral insead of keeping them away as I personally was as a child.  In all this is a great movie with realism, humour and overall brilliant acting.  Strongly recommended.",1043798400,9,1307,4.237903225806452

Rosie really didn't impress me on her own, it was Joseph Cross, the little boy who is searching for God to make sure that his grandfather is OK in heaven.  He did a great job for such a young actor.

958982,5,6305051135,"This movies is great for all ages. It's about a little boy named Joshua who goes to a catholic school. Through out the movie he searches for god and flashes back to memories of his grandpa. All the while trying to deal with the loss of his grandpa. Josh does this through asking a ton of questions and absorbing as much information as he can. The dialogue was humorous and cute.  I particularly liked how the story was conveyed with simplicity and class. The ending is one of the best endings you could hope for in a movie. I got a little teary eyed every now and then. The cast was great. Rosie O'Donnel plays one of Josh's teachers, Julia Styles is Josh's older sister and there are a bunch of other contributers too. I don't think this movie ever got a whole lot of attention, but it sure deserves it. It just goes to show you that you can always find a good movie hiding on a not so popular shelf.",1016668800,,901,4.238372093023256

This movie is enchanting, funny, moving and somehow profound.  This is from the guy who wrote and directed THE SIXTH SENSE and WIDE AWAKE has a few things in common with SENSE: it deals with grief in real emotional terms, it has an INCREDIBLE performance by a young actor (Joseph Cross)and a neat little ""surpirse"" at  the end.

958984,3,6305051135,"Hi, I watched this movie with my friends and wrote some comments below.  We thought...  What did you think?
<Neve>
 This movie is pretty touching.  One of my favorites is the scene that Joshua gave a speech to his class at the end.  From searching for God, he found not only God but also something precious for him. In his speech, his feelings or purity were expressed very nicely and I was moved quite.
 I guess many people believe the existence of God like Joshua but I think the images or the way of thinking of God would be different from person to person.  I believe God and I have my own God in my mind. When I got trouble I feel better by believing existence of God.
 Do you believe God?  If you do, What is your God like? or What is God for you?
<Noripy>
 I like this movie.  He found the answer.  He has believed God.  I don't believe God.  I'd like to be a person like him.  I think to keep believing is very important for everybody.  He tried to search for God, and he did it!  He could learn many things by overcoming his grandfather's death.  I think his grandfather taught him an important thing.
 I like the last scene of his speech.  I was moved.  He could understand the meaning of his grandfather's words.  With this experience he will get on an adult.
 What is your most favorite scene?  I want to talk about it!!
<Fraulein Shneider>
It is interesting to know how children become adults.  The movie ""Wide Awake"" is connected with the world after death.  On the whole, children's view is totally different from adults' one about it, but Joshua's case is something different.  I don't know what it is actually.  If you know the answer, please let me know.
<Miwa>
 We can see the growth of hero.  He could came to treasure the thing of invisible.  For example, he said that he treasure his family and girl.  He could know the worm of death of grand father through he lost his grand father.  So, I like the scene that he read his composition.
 Why is sixth grade easier than fifth grade?  Do you think it's just because he could find God?

<Snowy>
I think his grandpa's death was so sad for Joshua, but he overcame it and grew up.  He will grow up more and more because he knew his grandpa was in good and God exist.
 I believe Gods existence.  I don7t think he always everyone has, but some people don't know miracles.  Maybe they notice when someone who they love die, like Joshua.
 Do you believe ""God""?",1001980800,2,2421,4.314732142857143

Like many of  you I think this movie has the potential to be a classic like ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" and I want to buy it and share it with all that I  know.  But I'm confused why Miramax would make such a great movie  with a  great cast and not promote it and release it to theaters?  And now that it  has been out on video for over a year, why will they not make it affordable  and widely available for purchase?
Back to the movie.  There are many  great messages for us to take with us from this movie.  But one message  that got me is this.  If you earnestly seek to find God, your life WILL be  changed!
If anyone has any ideas to WAKE UP Miramax to bring down the  price and make it available at retail stores, let me know.",941155200,8,864,4.011834319526627

7881916,5,6305051135,"After THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, SIGNS, and THE VILLAGE, I decided to go spelunking and find out what M Knight S had done before these, if anything.  I was surprised to find this little underappreciated gem of a comedy drama psychological study listed under his directorial credits.  It was immediately picked up and thankfully so for it is well cast with keen sensibilities, is superbly written, and well plotted out.  I do not like to give away too much and prefer spoiler-free reviews so I will not delve too deeply or long, just wishing the prospective fan of M Knight to give this a try.  It did not fare well with ""professional"" critical reviews, but at least got a somewhat thumb up from Roger Ebert.  The plot is essentially the journey of discovery of a young boy who has lost his beloved Grandfather and central to this is a rather serious (under the funny bits) discussion of death, dying, the afterlife, etc.  O'Donnell becomes his not too reluctant mentor and champion in his quest, she provides the quiet comedy which runs throughout the film without becoming a distraction is very well cast in her role.  Overall, the film has fared better with movie fans than critics and is one of those treasures which can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age, gender, or faith.  It is also, like the M K S films listed above, one of his better features you will return to.  Unfortunately (for me, maybe not you) he followed this with the very disappointing LADY IN THE WATER which did absolutely zero for me!  THE HAPPENING was okay though a big step down, but he has only returned close to form in 2015 with the rather silly but still edgy THE VISIT which is probably his best film since THE VILLAGE.
