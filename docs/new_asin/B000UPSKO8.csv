I would have liked to have been there are the time, but this performance puts you right there and you are part of it.  There's something about a live concert that makes it a simply joyous affair.  Attending a live concert on DVD is a great way to spend an evening. I loved every one of these singers and they just get better as the performance goes on.

2923817,4,B000UPSKO8,"Marco Armiliato makes an example of how an orchestra needs to sound to support the singers and to be a solist itself. Magnificent.
Tezier and Garanca are in increasing form of singing, nevertheless are perhaps little moveless. The XXI century singers needs to be more agile at stage, in opera and concert.
Netrebko and Vargas are in frenetical race with their respective colleagues to be considered the prima donna and the primo tenore.
Netrebko is radiant, with a singing plein of virtuosism, of color, of power.
Vargas is technically great. The voice proyection, his phrasing, and his control makes a loving lirical model.
It is a concert to enjoy.",1203638400,11,650,4.972477064220183
2923818,5,B000UPSKO8,"This DVD of the Opera Gala from Baden-Baden is truly a worthy addition to anyone's collection of beautiful singing. The video and audio are excellent. All four featured singers possess gorgeous voices and in top form. The ladies looked divine and performed all their numbers magnificently. The baritone Ludovic Tezier was likewise quite impressive in my first introduction to his considerable talent. However, it was tenor Ramon Vargas who proved to be the rock and big star of the show. Although his voice has grown into a robust, powerful spinto with dark colors, he has not lost any of his admirable and distinctive qualities such as his trademark elegant legato singing, masterful control of dynamics, unerring sense of belcanto style and musicality of the highest order. His burnished bronze served him well in the dramatic Verdi numbers. Not only did he sing the most and clearly garnered the most ovation for his arias and duets, he was chiefly instrumental in raising the excitement level throughout the evening everytime he came out to do his solo or duet. For instance, after Anna Netrebko brought the roof down with the Lehar number and her bag of amusing tricks (seemingly an impossible act to follow), Vargas followed with a rollicking and powerful rendition of Rossini's La Danza in a pretty brisk tempo and demolished the remainder of the house left by Netrebko. It's that kind of a night that clearly belonged to Vargas, the senior of the group. Elina Garanca was sensational in the Spanish number too. The way the ladies looked  and everybody sang made this gala a truly memorable one, and hard to top yardstick for a gala of four in the future.",1202169600,35,1662,4.8936170212765955
2923819,5,B000UPSKO8,"This is an excellent concert recording. As mentioned by another reviewer, the lesser known singers were up to the high standards of Netrebko and Vargas. Netrebko and Garanca were exceptional in their acting even though this was a concert. They gave the impression they were enjoying themselves as much as the audience was.",1201737600,19,322,5.09433962264151
2923820,5,B000UPSKO8,"This DVD is a perfect alternative if you're not in the mood to listen or to watch an entire opera, for it provides well-known arias the majority of opera funs are familiar with. The video is of excellent quality and so is the audio. The auditorium is miked- there are mikes dispersed in various positions in the house for sound recording- but not the individual singers; and that exposes weaknesses and strengths. Ramon Vargas is the weakest in the link. If I'm not mistaken, he replaced the ailing Villazon. What a pity! His voice is small and with limited projectiom to cut above the orchestra, and barely audible in ensemble singing. Netrebko completely outsang him at the end of the duet from La Boheme. Vargas never had a big voice and its color is rather limited. The arias he sang, like ""Una furtiva lagrima,"" the staple of golden-voice tenors, like Gigli, Pavarotti, and even Villazon, lacked colorization and chatacter, and they were rather monochromatic.
Tezier has a beautiful lyric baritonal voice of moderate size and his reading of ""Per me giunto- lo morro"" from Verdi's Don Carlo was admirable. On the other hand, a Verdi baritone needs a little more heft in the lower range which he's lacking; and that was more noticable in his ""Toreador Song.""
The stars of this concert are Garanca and Netrebko. Garanca's reading of the aria ""Mon coeur..."" from Samson et Dalila was superb, full of passion, yearning, and surrender. And her coloratura, in La Cerenentola's aria, fires rapid-machine-gun trills to kill you!
What more can be said about Natrebko. You wish she would never stop singing. Her rendition of ""Casta Diva"" maybe is not suited to everybody's taste, but the darkness of her voice brings something unique and totally her own. Her encore ""Meine Lippen"" from Lehar's Giuditta brought the house down, and showed the theater and stage animal in Anna's heart that burst all over the place: shoes kicking up and flowers throwing; twirling, dancing, and flirting! This DVD is fun, with high caliber artistic value. It deserves five stars and is highly recommended.

2923823,5,B000UPSKO8,"This is the COMPLETE version of the Baden-Baden Concert on July 2007, available on DVD from DG, whereas the CD is the excerpted version.
By ALL means get this DVD version, since it contains double the contents of the CD, with some BEST performances NOT available on the CD version. (Plus stunning visual effects, of course).
Having reviewed the CD version earlier on, I must say that the complete concert reveals some thing quite different and interesting.
DG, in its inlaid leaflet, claims that its two artists Elina Garanca and in particular Anna Netrebko alone would have made the concert a success.
True - but only to a certain extent, and the truth lies mainly in the VISUAL aspect.
Without doubt, both Netrebko and Garanca are top-notch singers. Netrebko owns a voice whose unfathomable lyricism is hard to beat these days from any lyrical soprano. Garanca is a top-notch coloratura mezzo-soprano in the league of the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Both ladies attired in Escada's gowns and Chopard jewelry, really presented a wonderful blend of commercialism and artistry.
Having said that, IMHV, the best performances that evening, rather from the two ladies, came from much less well-known (allow me to say so since I do not reside in Europe) French baritone Ludovic Tezier.
Right after the Norma duet from Netrebko and Garanca after the opening sinfonia, Tezier gave the concert its 'morning call' by his Il Puritani solo aria, a wonderful display of lyrical baritone, rich in tone and flying in coloratura singing. Garanca's Rossini aria from La Cenerantola is the second showpiece, fully demonstrating an agile coloratura. Her Italian diction suffering slightly from comparison with Tezier's, who, by all standards, is a great Verdian baritone in the making judging from his impeccable Italian and wonderful Verdian interpretation in the two Don Carlo excerpts that evening. All these wonderful pieces, apart from Tezier's Don Carlo solo, are NOT available on the CD version.
The two MET stars Ramon Vargas and Anna Netrebko were the natural spotlights in this evening, but Vargas, with a significant reduction in body weight, suffered also a reduction in vocal prowess. His shimmering upper register, so famously beautiful, lost some of its usual lustre this evening. On the whole, his performance could be termed 'passable', but short of brilliant.
Anna Netrebko's voice being as stunning as ever, the focus got onto her diction as she sang in Italian, German and French on this particular evening. My alien ears however failed to catch the differences, and had to reort to the subtitles' search to find out in what language she was singing, as all sounded so much alike.
The Lehar encore piece by Anna included a stunning dancing stint from the soprano, and would otherwise have been perfect but for the slight hiccup in the returning section, luckily speedily picked up by conductor Armiliato. This piece certainly was NOT included in the CD version.",1199145600,109,2965,5.090349075975359

There was nice balance between singers and orchestra and there was very little extraneous audience noise.  The video director made excellent visual choices.

Being sort of new to opera, I had not heard some of these pieces before, but enjoyed them immensely. The 'Lakme' duet was gorgeous! The ladies voices blended beautifully. I had not heard of Tezier before, but he has a great voice. It isn't as full as Hvorostovsky or Terfel, but it is expressive with a good range. The solo from Don Carlo was beautiful, and I liked it better than the version I have by Hvorostosky.
The encores show the fun all of the performers were having. I think the first violin had an unforgettable time. Netrebko kicking off her shoes and dancing; Garanca flirting with the audience, and Tezier's 'Toreador"" all make it one of my favorite dvds.",1360108800,5,819,4.616438356164384

2923859,5,B000UPSKO8,"Usually I prefer a full opera, rather than medly of famous arias. The problem with a bunch of sweet arias is there is no emotional build up and rapport between audience and the performers. This is one exception.

At the beginning, I had doubts how it will pan out. To the credit of producers and the singers, there actually was a gradually build up all the way to the end. It is highly entertaining and you get swept away by all four singers, although Netrebco often stole the show. It is a very very enjoyable performance.",1344124800,,523,4.447916666666667
2923860,4,B000UPSKO8,"I have enjoyed this concert in general terms but found the previous Waldbuhne concert to be even more enjoyable.

To my mind this concert suffers from two main problems: The first problem is a fundamental lack of variety in the pacing with a large proportion of slow items. The Waldbuhne concert, by way of example, shows that this need not be the case with far more variety throughout.

The other problem for me on this disc is the 'performance' by Tezier. It is important in vocal music for the performer to communicate - with the character being sung to, the audience or both. Tezier does very little of any of these. Throughout his items the camera clearly shows his eyes focussing inwards to himself and not outwards to others. In this important regard I also find the four singers featured on the Waldbuhne concert to have far more interactive personalities both with each other and also with the large open-air audience.

Returning to this current disc, all three of the other soloists communicate well with each other as appropriate. My favourite singer on this occasion is Garanca followed closely by Vargas and Netrebko.

The orchestra plays well and is sympathetically conducted by Marco Armiliato. The imaging is crisp with good colour rendition. The camera work is supportive of the singers and the music. The sound is good and is presented in DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo.

For those who warm to this group of singers and the chosen repertoire this will be a clear 5 star issue although I personally have some reservations as above. For those reasons I will stick to a more cautious 4 stars.",1343520000,,1598,4.77536231884058
2923861,5,B000UPSKO8,"I love this DVD, absolutely great.

A little disappoint at men, but still good.",1339977600,,246,5.175
2923862,5,B000UPSKO8,I highly recommend this DVD.  Others have commented on the details so I will not duplicate.  It is a performance you will want to watch over and over again.  Anna Netrebko is the star of the evening but the other 3 are top notch singers so I give them all 5 stars and it is always a pleasure to have Marco Armiliato conducting.  He does an excellent job without making a spectacle of himself like some other conductors do.  Great selection of music with some unknowns to me which have now become favourites.,1328400000,,507,4.408602150537634
2923863,5,B000UPSKO8,"A wonderful Opera Gala! All the singers and the orchestra performed beatufully. I especially enjoyed the female and male duets and the quartet from Rigoletto. Anna Netrebko's encore from Lehar brought down the house, as she danced, tossed flowers to the audiance and messed with the first chair violin player. This is a must see!! Anna has become quite the entertainer!!!

All of the singers seemed very comfortable with each other and the conductor. All are having a great time and this adds to the enjoyment of this DVD. I highly recommend it.",1327708800,,545,4.860215053763441

The disc is a must for every opera lover.",1326240000,,114,4.75
2923865,5,B000UPSKO8,"As my title notes, this is a keeper. One of the greatest opera concerts (not opera productions, but staged concerts) ever recorded. Anna Netrebko and Elina Garanca in the ""Dome epais, le jasmin"" duet from Delibes Lakme that will raise the hair on your neck and put a lump in your throat. Ramon Vargas and Ludovic Tezier sing the ""au fond du temple saint"" duet from Bizet's Pearl Fishers as well as it has ever been done (esp. the boyish-faced Vargas in the lead). And then there is Garanca primping and preening (vocally and theatrically) in the tavern scene from Rigoletto. And then there are the encores (five by my count), started off spicily enough by the hot-tamale Netrebko dancing her part (not pretending to dance, but dancing!) and throwing flowers to the men in the audience. But I better stop before I can't. Netrebko is a true prima donna assoluta, the greatest of the great for our era, but she is more than a disembodied voice. She has (vocal and operatic) star-power to die for, to put Angelina Jolie or Sharon Stone in the shade. This disk is a potentially life-changing event, as all of the greatest art always is. Enthusiastically recommended (especially in Blu-Ray, with its far superior picture and sound--something that is not usually recognized: you've never heard a DVD this beautiful!)",1326067200,5,1309,4.822222222222222
2923866,2,B000UPSKO8,"""A Gala From Baden-Baden""

The singers in this concert are
So fing arrogant!
Huggy, huggy!  Curl your lips
And keep your noses up!
Their voices aren't that wonderful,
Subtle and subdued,
Gentle, warm and peaceful
And inaudible.
After every number
The conductor turns around
And claps his hands.  The singer smiles.
The orchestra applauds.
This is all so nauseous!
Did they all take lessons
From Callas in unqualified conceit?
The women show their bbies
And the men are dipped in grease!

I just threw the DVD in the garbage.  Had enough of Netrebko singing ""Casta Diva"" badly, kissing the conductor, then slouching and smiling a crooked smile at the roaring audience as though she had talent.  Could she mop floors any better than she can sing?  I've had enough of ALL of them!  America - the land of philistines.  Europe - a lot of historical stuffed shirts!  The British think they're being good when actually they're just uncomfortable.  Shaw (an honest man who was not executed or imprisoned) said something like that.

One star because I love the male friendship duet from ""Don Carlo"" no matter who sings it, or how badly.",1314748800,4,1127,4.8125
2923867,4,B000UPSKO8,"As a result of HD transmission and DVD's opera has reached a flexion point.  It is no longer enough for an opera star  to just stand and sing.  She must be able to emote creditably and in many parts to be a trained dancer.  Anna Netrebko illustrates this flexion point.  She and the technology reinforce each other.  I will watch and listen to this DVD many, many  times.",1313539200,,371,4.367647058823529
2923868,4,B000UPSKO8,"This DVD will provide a plenty of a light-weight evening entertainment, with some of the most popular arias nicely sung by top-selling singers.  Anna Netrebko's beauty is matched by her voice, and she steals the show with a great show of herself in Lehar's Giuditta, when she starts seducing the audience slowly by breaking the roses from a huge bouquet she holds in her arms and throwing the flowers into parterre, with well-behaved well-tied well-suited well-aged solid Baden/German burgers catching the treats with delight, with their equally important and aged fraus watching over them and the young singing siren in various degrees of astonishment, from admiration to disapproval.

When Netrebko finally kicks-off her high-heeled shows and starts leaping the stage, dancing, the uproar sets in and for this one piece this DVD is worth watching.  This Baden-Baden crowd, so unsmiling and utterly serious, as typical German audience, was so shaken off and made to finally laugh with pleasure!  For anyone who has ever been to that theater it is also amazing to see that it is almost full - we are talking of a Metropolitan Opera size opera house in a relatively small city!  I was amazed when I saw its size inside - from the outside it seems rather small, but they only kept the old facade; inside it is a huge house.  But it was not nearly as full for one of the greatest productions of Tosca I had ever seen, with Catherine Naglestad and Alexandrs Antonenko.  How hype the names of this gala must be to fill this cyclopean edifice for this performance!

Next prize, this time for virtuosity in singing, goes to Elina Caranca.  Her command of her voice and the sheer beauty of it is at the level of Vesselina Kasarova or Lorraine Hunt; she is truly a great mezzo-soprano, exceptionally gifted.  Her singing of ""Nacqui all'affano"" from Rossini's La Cenerentola is breath-taking.  Perhaps she does not have Netrebko's sex appeal and could not be as believable a Traviata (albeit soprano part), but...I do not think Netrebko is the same-level virtuoso.

Their Norma rendition is very good, and sounds better to me than Sutherland/Horne, but perhaps not than Mirella Freni/Renata Scotto; but it is comparable.  It is interesting to notice that Netrebko's voice is so Callas-like here, and it is a pleasure to listen to.  But as with Callas, I suspect that are limits to what she can do as a singer; and as an actress and singer together, she yields to Natalie Dessay, for example; however, her Traviata is probably one of teh most memorable.  Together with Garanca their ""Mira, o Norma"" was quite a treat, visually, too, as they are dressed in Escada and their jewelery is by Chopard, marvelous.

As for Vargas, he is quite good as Duca di Mantova, and it would be great to listen to him live; but I would not call his performance here dazzling.

Ludovic Tezier is a baritone whose looks make him a perfect Lord Ashton or other romantic opera nobles, but I think his voice is too high for COunt de Luna or Don Giovanni.  He has put a good performance here, but nothing to rave about.

Overall, a nice entertainment for the evening, truly this show fits Baden-Baden heavy 19th century bourgeois inclinations so well.

2923879,4,B000UPSKO8,"Anna Netrebko is always superlative. Having said that this DVD is not as overwhelmingly stupendous as is the Berlin concert.

There is nothing wrong with the singing of the many popular arias. But the evening as a whole does not have that Hair-on-the-back-of-the-neck tingling sensation that makes the Berlin Gala concert so outstanding.

Compare the final item on both concerts and you will see and feel what I mean.

2923881,5,B000UPSKO8,"This beautifully presented gala spotlights the next generation of opera stars from around the world: Anna Netrebko from Saint Petersburg Russia, Elina Garanca from Riga Latvia, Ramon Vargas from Mexico City Mexico and Ludovic Tezier from Marseilles France. They are at the top of their form singing solos and duets from great operas before an enthusiastic audience. Near the end of the concert Netrebko steals the show by tossing off her shoes, dancing around the stage and throwing flowers to the men in the audience. This gala is one that you will want to watch many times and share with your friends. Highly recommended.",1268438400,3,623,5.0

2923884,5,B000UPSKO8,"This live recording of a performance in Baden-Baden in 2007 is just the thing for explaining to friends why you like beautiful singing and ""the finer things in life."" Nearly twenty arias, duets, and more provide a variety of great moments from favorite operas.

Anna Netrebko and Elina Garanca treat the audience to scenes from Bellini's Norma, and the hauntingly light and ethereal flower duet from Delibes' Lakme. Ramon Vargas and Ludovic Tezier follow with a deliriously successful rendition of the duet from The Pearl Fishers, and the audience goes wild with appreciation.

Among other delightful scenes is the ""O soave fanciulla"" duet from La Boheme, done lovingly by Vargas and Netrebko. Another unforgettable event was what I call the ""through the window"" quartet from Rigoletto, with Vargas crooning the ""Bella figlia dell'amore."" It is the juxtaposition of the two couples in the same scene that sets opera apart (and above?) the other arts, and they sing it so well here.

But for me, the best piece in the program is Anna Netrebko's ""Meine Lippen, sie kussen so heiss"" from Lehar's Giuditta. I thought her performance in the earlier Berlin concert could never again be equaled, but she outdoes herself here! When she reaches the part of the song telling of her beautiful mother, the dancer, Netrebko kicks off her shoes and whirls, dancing across the stage. How rarely do we see an opera singer who can not only sing and act, but is also graceful on her feet. As she delivers each line, she picks roses out of her bouquet and tosses them to members of the admiring audience. OK--I know some will say this is playing to the crowd, but when you're that beautiful, graceful, AND can sing so well--she can do whatever she wants!! It's a delightful concert. You'd enjoy inviting friends to watch it with you.",1263254400,2,1814,4.84516129032258

2923887,5,B000UPSKO8,"I have a large opera collection and many of the opera gala concerts are enjoyed but aren't up to the caliber of singing in this terrific concert.  First of all, it's a hit parade of arias and duets - you'll love all the selections chosen.  The performance of all four is just the best in opera today; the men were in top voice, (Vargas best I've heard him in awhile) and the women spectacular!  The other concert that I like as much as this is the one from Berlin with Domingo, Villazon, and Netrebko.  That one is worth having just to hear and see Rolando who will not be singing until he recovers and rehabs from vocal surgery.  Treat yourself and your friends to this video - makes a great gift too - it is highly recommended!!

2923891,5,B000UPSKO8,"This opera gala from Baden Baden features four great singers: Anna Netrebko  Elina Garanca  Ramn Vargas  Ludovic Tzier. They sing many popular opera arias including ""Mon coeur s'ouvre  ta voix"" from Samson et Dalila (Camille Saint-Sans) and Flower Duet from Lakm (Delibes), the latter of which I think is a great bonus because it is hardly seen in any live concert DVDs or blu-rays. All the singers performed very nicely. Mr. Vargas's rendition of the Donizetti's aria from ""L'elisir d'amore"" was excellent and impressive. Most of all, however, Netrebko was the hightlight of the show. When she performed the Lehar's aria from ""Giuditta"" particularly, she revealed all her passion and energy with her singing and even dancing. It was a very fun, funny and entertaining moment! It showed what the best part of a live concert is. To me, this 6 minute performance alone makes this blu-ray worth getting and owning. If you have the blu-ray or DVD, The Berlin Concert Live from the Waldbhne featuring Domingo, Villazn and Netrebko, you will notice that there are some overlapped songs as a reviewer mentioned. It was actually fun for me to compare them each other by different singers and rendition.

I enjoyed the concert and just hoped that more live concert blu-rays would be released.",1230163200,8,1283,4.9766355140186915
2923892,4,B000UPSKO8,"Once again the Blu-ray format has brought new life and impact to a classical concert. Both the picture and sound are stunning - whether you select the DTS or PCM soundtracks you will not be disappointed. The added resolution and colour definition make the picture really come alive. The singers and orchestra both perform without fault. However, the program itself is quite acceptable, but definitely not inspired.
This recording has three shortcomings which prevented me from giving it a 5-star rating. First, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired. There is definitely too much zooming - in some concerts this would not be a problem but for this kind of material it is quite distracting. This is not the best example of TV direction -- while it may be considered acceptable in some circles it definitely does not enhance the overall impact in this kind of venue. Secondly, the subtitles are often difficult to read against a white background - I cannot understand why they cannot impose these on a grey background to improve readability. And thirdly, there are some odd camera angles and as in other discs I have reviewed the camera does not stay on the singers when they are actually singing - it often cuts away to the orchestra or audience and all the viewer sees is the singer's back. Too often, the camera zooms in or out from the singer. Surely TV directors should realize that overuse of zooms and cutaways is not acceptable or artistic in a recording of this kind from a prestigious company like DG.",1230076800,24,1513,4.734848484848484
2923893,4,B000UPSKO8,"For those of us who like a recorded concert, this is a beautiful recording, the singers well known, the music well known to all and the images in perfect resolution. It is very enjoyable. Only one problem: a concert in Berlin in 2006 (both with Marco Armiliato as Conductor)was also released this year by Deutsche Gramophone in Bluray and the program of this Disc has many of the same repertoire as the Berlin one. Even the Traviata's Brindisi with the glasses of champagne at the end of the program is the same. I have nothing against repeating a repertoire, in particular a successful one, when concerts are given in different cities, but when recordings are sold worldwide; the repetition diminishes the impact of it. The operatic repertoire is vast enough to choose from.",1228176000,4,775,4.834586466165414
2923894,5,B000UPSKO8,"Do not hesitate to buy this DVD. It is worth every dollar. The four singers really stand out, Netrebko with her angel-like voice, Vargas with a wonderful tenor voice, Garanca as a colorful mezzo and Tezier as a brilliant baritone. Each and every aria are outstandingly sung and when the four of them join to sing both an aria from Rigoletto and from Traviata their voices blend wonderfully. It is one of those treasures that are worth being discovered. Javier from Bariloche",1219276800,7,474,4.7926829268292686

I had read good reviews of this concert and was familiar with all of the singers except Elina Garanca, but i was still surprised by the quality of this program. Anna Netrebco is, as usual, very good until her encore when she kicks off her shoes and brings the house down.
Few concerts are worth more than a viewing or two - this is an exception. It's well worth buying

My only gripe is with the ordering of the encores, of which there are also a generous amount.  I won't spoil anything here but having Anna Netrebko do her shocker of a 'Meine Lippen' early on makes everything that follows look anticlimactic.",1515801600,,540,5.267441860465116
