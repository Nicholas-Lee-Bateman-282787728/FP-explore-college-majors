8560921,5,B00B1LKXRW,"This DVD is three episodes of three different Scooby-Doo series; the original, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, and What's New, Scooby-Doo. If you're a collector, and already own the seasons, there's no reason to buy this (unless you're the really complete collector, then that's your own problem.) Judged on their own merits, they're fun episodes, with the first and the last filled with all the fake monsters we expected. (The 13 Ghosts has actual supernatural and lacks Velma, two strikes in my book.)

So don't pick it up if you have to have everything, but if you want a sample of three episodes, it's a perfect package.",1371600000,2,621,4.803738317757009
