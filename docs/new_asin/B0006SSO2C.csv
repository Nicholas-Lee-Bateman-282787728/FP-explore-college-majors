8042796,5,B0006SSO2C,I work at the zoo with the Apes.  I am always looking for something on DVD or in book form to donate for our silent auction every year.,1290988800,,135,3.8214285714285716
8042797,5,B0006SSO2C,My baby has been watching this video since he was 3 months. He's now 7 months and still watches it 2-3 times a day and is learning and enjoying it alot.,1285891200,,152,3.935483870967742
8042798,4,B0006SSO2C,Fantastic video without any 'too real' wild animal moments. The excitement of the chase cuts to something else interesting at just the right time so no fast forwarding needed. A little long but well there are times when that's a good thing. The kids (3.5 and 18mo.) really like it.,1249948800,2,281,4.64
8042799,5,B0006SSO2C,I'm always looking for videos to send my grandchildren.  They love animals - and this video is a winner!,1233792000,,104,4.473684210526316
8042800,4,B0006SSO2C,"Growing Up WIld is by far one of my daughter's (2 1/2 yrs) favorite DVDs.

It's funny, lot's of baby animals and long, so there's lots to watch.

I'd get it for other family's kids, so there you go.",1232323200,2,198,4.051282051282051
8042801,5,B0006SSO2C,"There is so much stuff on this video!!  I love that you can play the episodes separately.  That way you don't have to sit through the whole thing for one particular animal.  Also, you can play just one episode when you need it (phone call, making dinner, etc!) and turn off the TV afterwards.  Super educational - lots of interesting facts!  Mom and dad learned stuff too!",1216339200,3,372,4.492537313432836
8042802,5,B0006SSO2C,"We purchased this DVD a year ago to help my daughter travel in the car. (She hated her car seat and would cry and fuss for the entire three plus hour drive to my mother's.) At that time, she was not quite two, and I didn't really like the idea of starting her on cartoons, even if educational. When I found this DVD, it seemed ideal. I was right. It's a huge hit with both mommy and baby.

Full of facts, but entertaining, my daughter still loves it a year later. She knows the names of the different animals, and bugs. She knows what they eat, where they live, how they travel, how they play (if they do), yet at no time does it show one animal eating another. Well, that's not entirely true. There are one or two instances in the one with the fish, but it is not gory and passes quickly. Each segment is about 20-30 minutes long. Perfect for the young attention span.

I have not seen other documentaries for children like this, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but I can tell you that my daughter loves it and I love that it's so educational and well edited.

I highly recommend it.",1181433600,20,1097,4.214285714285714
