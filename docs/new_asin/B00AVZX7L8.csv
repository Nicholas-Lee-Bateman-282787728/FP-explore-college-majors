8558126,5,B00AVZX7L8,"This DVD contains a 57-minute (running time is mislabeled on the box and on Amazon) documentary featuring women who regret their abortions speaking about their experiences. The disc also includes some special features clips. Designed as a healing tool for women suffering from post-abortion trauma, the documentary additionally features Catholic and Protestant authorities on this issue, including Catholic ""theology of the body"" scholar Christopher West.

There are no scare tactics or graphic depictions of abortion here, but just women telling their personal stories about how they came to terminate their pregnancies, emphasizing the emotional traumas that followed. There's no particular topical organization to the video, but the filmmaking quality is high-gloss and appealing. Perhaps best designed for therapeutic use, since much of the footage appears to come from a group therapy session, it would also be excellent for a pro-life group or bioethics class exploring life issues. Many of the stories here are deeply moving. I recommend giving it a look.",1400025600,2,1062,5.596273291925466
