7802544,5,5552642759,"I am a prophecy enthusiast and I have been looking for the first movie ""The Omega Code"", but could not find it. When I saw this collection, I was thrilled that I could get them all at one time, in a package. Great movies!",1266278400,5,221,4.045454545454546
7802545,4,5552642759,"This is a boxed collection of two movies, plus one CD rom. The first one titled ""The Omega Code"", the one that started it all as a code was thought to be with-in the Holy Bible in it's original language(s) of Hebrew and Greek.

The code was believed to tell of events of history from the past, and working it's way through to the present times, and to the point of even telling of things and events in the future yet to happen.

The second movie in the collection, titled, ""Megiddo: The Omega Code 2"" tells the story of the end times which one can find in the book of ""Revelations"" in the Holy Bible. Which tells of the great battle of all nations against the nation of Israel, (God's chosen people) on the plains of Megiddo.

The CD rom of the collection is for use on both the PC and Mac computers, and when it is used, it becomes like an animated 360 degrees aspect of what it was like when the Lord Jesus Christ walked the earth some 2,000 years ago. You learn about the lives of the people around Him at the time, and also, what the buildings might have looked like at the time of Christ.

Ok, the reason I had to buy this collection was because of the first movie which is no longer in print (The Omega Code); I spent a lot of time searching for about two to three years trying to find the first movie in video stores and some Christian books stores, and I could never find it anywhere, thanks to Amazon.com I now have the complete collection. I hope that this reveiw helps others too.",1241568000,18,1491,4.221052631578948
