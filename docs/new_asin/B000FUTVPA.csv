2591380,5,B000FUTVPA,"Initially I purchased this DVD set thinking that I would be viewing a low-grade version of 'Gilmore Girls' set in New York City.  But within the first several minutes of the pilot I realized that I was mistaken.  But what I discovered was a quirpy/inspired series that, while not original, is definately interesting and worth checking out.

The show follows the Kerr family as mother Kerr moves herself and her two teenage daughters (one 16 the other 19) to New York City to start their lives over after she catches her husband in bed with another woman.  From here the series follows the three woman as they reajust to living completely new/different lives in the big city.",1166659200,19,674,4.735042735042735
2591381,5,B000FUTVPA,"I really enjoy this show! Its fun and well worth the money!

I actually haven't got it yet, but I hope I will soon!

It has mother daughter relationships, and how much this family grows together over this period of time!

I recommend it to anyone that likes Gilmore Girls!",1164758400,7,272,4.4

2591383,4,B000FUTVPA,"""Beautiful people"" is an entertaining series that you might like, specially if you were a fan of ""Dawson Creek"". Even though this show is not overly original, it is engaging, and even addictive :)

There are three main characters: a mother, Lynn Kerr (Daphne Zuniga) and her two daughters, Karen (Torrey DeVitto) and Sophie (Sarah Foret). Lynn has been left by her husband, and is ready for a change. After her younger daughter, Sophie, earns a scholarship to study in a very good school in New York City, she is convinced by both Sophie and Karen that moving to NYC is an excellent idea. Lynn wants to be a fashion designer, Karen wants to find success as a model, and Sophie is eager to study in a new school. But will they be able to fit with the ""beautiful people""? And do they want to fit, or just be themselves and find a way to fulfill their dreams in that way?

I should point out that the title of this series, ""Beautiful people"", makes reference to some of the kids Sophie finds at her new school. However, and in a more general sense, I think it is also an allusion to a different kind of environment, an environment the three girls are not used too and are not totally convinced they like. On the other hand, NYC is also an enchanting city that offers them lots of opportunities to find success, friendship and love, chances they will jump at, even though not always wisely.

What will happen? Well, watch this dvd and find out. I can tell you I enjoyed this series, and that I plan to watch the second season, to be released this year. Recommended!

2591466,4,B000FUTVPA,"This show had its debut late in the summer of 2005, and in some ways might be viewed as a mini-series since it only ran for a single season. The ""small-town girl in the big city"" isn't the most original idea, but I disagree with other reviewers who feel watching it is a waste of time because it's been done before, or because some of the storylines were left unresolved due to the lack of a finale. Rather than one girl moving to New York City, there are three of them -- perhaps to appeal to different generations of viewers. There's teenaged Sophie, 20-something Karen, and their middle-aged mother Lynn. The focus of their new lives falls neatly into high school intrigues, modeling, and fashion design respectively. There's some overlap of their worlds: for example, the father of one of Sophie's classmates turns out to be an old flame of her mom's. The three protagonists often get back together at the end of each day and compare notes -- sometimes with entertaining results.

The title ""Beautiful People"" has multiple meanings that are revealed as the series unfolds. It's commonly understood as a decades-old slang term for the rich, trendy in-crowd. In this show's context, we learn that it's the nickname for a clique at Sophie's new school, called the BPs for short. The irony of this name becomes evident, since on closer examination, many of the BPs are really not as attractive close-up -- as Sophie finds out firsthand. But also, as the story develops, we realized that the term could refer to some of the people the Kerr women encounter, who due to their honesty and compassion truly are beautiful inside, even if they aren't popular or successful.

On the ""pro"" side, some viewers may find the familiarity of the newcomers premise appealing, with reminders of earlier shows such as Mary Tyler Moore. Most performances are passable, and some are quite good. The ensemble combines well-known names like Daphne Zuniga with up-and-coming talent. Exterior shots of New York are used to disguise the fact that most of the show was shot in Toronto. (I realize that some may feel this is a bad thing, but I'm all for the development of Canada's domestic talent: several of the young Canadians, like Kathleen Munroe from Hamilton (yay!), Kyle Schmid, and Ricky Mabe, have since gone on to promising careers in the States.) In some cases the show's restricted budget works in its favor -- my New York friends point out that TV frequently misrepresents the types of housing that people would be able to afford there, but in this case the tiny, somewhat shabby apartment is probably realistic for the Kerr family.

Most of the main actors get at least a few minutes per episode to help establish their characters. It's interesting to see the development, especially in relationships between particular people. Nicky and Gideon move from open hostility in the pilot episode, to Nicky actually defending Gideon in public. Karen, who scorned postsecondary education, eventually chooses an apprenticeship to a very demanding boss in order to learn about professional photography. The tension between Gideon and his father is revealed during the series ... Gideon has some of the funniest lines on the show, yet he seldom laughs, and it becomes evident that his sarcasm is protection for a sensitive heart.

Some of the ""cons"" in the show were probably unavoidable, given that it was just starting out -- the rotating writers and directors give it an uneven feel. Some characters have to fluctuate between extremes, as required by the changing storylines. Gideon is an accident-prone geek in Episode 1, a ""spiteful little boy"" as described by one online commentator in Episode 3, and a loving and loyal friend as Sophie sees him in Episode 7. Also, many of the ""teenagers"" cast don't look 15-16: this is typical of a lot of TV shows, though. Due to labor laws and budgetary constraints, often older actors are required to play younger. (An actor friend who often did these types of roles pointed out that once they're past 18, nobody cares if they're worked from dawn to dusk at a producer's whim!)

So you may have to use your imagination to get into this show -- in fact, some parts may require a window-washing scaffold to suspend your disbelief. Sophie's winning a prestigious scholarship is credible, but Karen and her mother both landing plum jobs shortly after arriving in the city, even with the patronage of Nicky's dad, is rather farfetched. Also, some fans expressed surprise about the amount of sex and drugs featured on the show, with even the ""good"" kids drinking underage and stealing their parents' Valium. Undoubtedly this does occur in real life, but given it was from the ABC Family Network, this may not have been the image the executives were hoping for.

The show seems to have retooled after the mid-season break, for when it resumed in 2006, the remaining 8 episodes have a very different feel. Unfortunately, some of the most interesting and entertaining characters almost disappear. (Spoiler: Jackson Rathbone fans may be a bit disappointed by the second half.) The show ends after a total of 16 episodes, with a lot of loose ends that possibly might have been tackled if it had been renewed for subsequent seasons. We never do find out what Annabelle's home life is like, or why Gideon is so reluctant to talk about his mother. Nor do we get any more information about the police investigation of Fiske Publishing, or the eventual outcome of the custody dispute between Lynn and her ex-husband.

The DVD has a few extras included -- while it was interesting to see the screen tests vs. how those scenes eventually ended up being played, as well as some scenes that were later deleted, fans of the show probably would have liked to see more material such as interviews or production notes. But altogether, this DVD set isn't a bad diversion -- especially if you're a fan of any of the principal actors and would like to see some of their work from the mid-2000s.",1357257600,2,5990,4.8266796494644595

2591488,2,B000FUTVPA,"I loved this show on tv when it was on but not anymore. I don't know if my tastes have changed or television has evolved, probably both.

This show is no where in comparison with Gilmore Girls. Gilmore Girls has happy, sad, and challenging moments. One thing after another keeps happening to this family and it is not at all realistic. Argument against this would be that it is television. Television, at least for me, is an escape from the days of graduate work, working, cooking, cleaning, etc. Hearing someone's problems every once in a while is fine but after the first episode there were no happy smiling moments.

If this were on after Days of Our Lives it would have had a great following and probably would not have been canceled. But up against Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill, this show never had a chance.

They jammed packed it in with every single problem imaginable, an affair, mother starting over, drug, teenage jealousy, high school drama, populars v nerds, and more. If they did half of these and Sophie wasn't played by such a horrible actress, the show would have done great.

It isn't that expensive for a season, so if you are looking for something to watch for fun to bring you back to your high school days, watch it, but don't have too high expectations.",1291680000,,1279,4.572052401746725

I wonder if this sort of series would make it here in the states? It currently runs on Logo, the gay channel so it is an appropriate home for it, if not slightly limiting. It does more for the gay liberation movement than ""Will & Grace"" ever could, in its ""safe network portrayal of  gays"". Imagine how much healthier the""coming out"" experience would be if more gay youths had access to it.

It has song, dance, jokes, bitch-fighting, drunken hairdressers, black posh spice dolls, exploding baked bean cans causing death and a soundtrack featuring Dannii and Kylie Minogue, Sophie Ellis Bextor, The Pet Shop Boys, Sam Wood and Dan Gillespie Sells of The Feeling.

Mum and Dad drink homemade wine, Simon hangs out with his best friend Kyle, better known as Kylie, working on dance moves to 90s floor fillers; his sister Ashlene wants to look like Heather Small and ""hang with the hood"", whilst his aunty Hayley is blind, feisty and eating nuts. Gran meanwhile used to be the nicest woman in the world and has now turned very nasty. "" Synopsis courtesy of Amazon.co.uk

Review:

When I heard that Simon Doonan's book, originally titled 'Nasty - My Family & Other Glamorous Varmints', had been turned into a mini-series and set in the 90s instead of the 60s I was a little concerned. After watching it, all fears of it being misplaced were gone, and I was left wanting more. I won't bore you with the plot, as that has been covered more by the Synopsis above, but the stamp of quality that the creators and writers of Gimme Gimme Gimme, Absolutely Fabulous and Beautiful Thing bring to this production are to be seen everywhere.

The casting could not have been improved upon, with an hysterical cameo by Brenda Fricker as Gran (or Narg - the backwards version awarded her). The two young leads (Luke Ward-Wilkinson & Layton Williams) are extraordinary in their complete command of their roles. Their comic timing and their singing, dancing and outrageous camping-up are truly amazing achievements. The rest of the ensemble will have you in stitches, however if you have seen the movie Beautiful Thing you might be somewhat disappointed or bemused. Tameka Empson gives almost a mirror-image performance, with every mannerism making you think she walked straight from the set of Beautiful Thing onto the set of Beautiful People. She is obviously one of Jonathan Harvey's faves (writer of both films), as is Meera Syal, who thankfully throws her all into being a blind bean-eating hippie in this series, leaving no reference to Beautiful Thing. Olivia Colman is touching as Debbie, the naive slapper mother (""Gin, Gin, where do I begin ? 'aving you inside me is like an old friend popping in""), and Aidan McArdle is the father everyone would like to have - amiable, if a little dim. Add Sarah Niles as Reba, Kylie's Mum, and you have the slap-fest of all times.

Messers Harvey and Plowman make full use of major events of the times, and the production values are extremely high. Add a fun soundtrack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beautiful-People/dp/B001G13C2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beautiful People</a>&nbsp;and you have the makings of an excellent series. Calls for another series may be a mistake - why mess with perfection.",1244073600,16,3300,5.045871559633028
