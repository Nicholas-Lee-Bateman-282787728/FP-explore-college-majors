5360243,5,B009P3J61C,I'm glad that The Flintstones had more cartoon movies after the show ended. Fred and Barney are so funny along with Wilma and Betty.

8543488,3,B009P3J61C,Prime time specials from the early 80s of your favorite 60s cartoon family! These are not as good as the original but still quite enjoyable. No special featutes. With the complete series package containing special features one wonders why another big package compiling all of the various specials and short lived series from the 70s-90s could not have been put together.,1502409600,,370,5.081967213114754
