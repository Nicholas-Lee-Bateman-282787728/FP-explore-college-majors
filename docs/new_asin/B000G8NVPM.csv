8129370,1,B000G8NVPM,"This DVD should have been called 'Tito  Ortiz Vs. Guy Metzger And How That Led To The Feud With Ken Shamrock' since Shamrock barely appears onscreen. Instead, this DVD focuses on Ortiz and Guy Metzger's battles - their initial bout where Metzger defeated Tito, a varsity wrestler, after Ortiz made a rookie mistake and how this paved the way for their imminent and much hyped rematch credited with getting Tito back into UFC. It was after this fight, in which Tito manhandled Metzger, that Ortiz made a lifelong enemy in Ken Shamrock after donning an inappropriate T-shirt he designed that featured a derogatory Metzger slur emblazoned across the chest. This again paved the way for an imminent and much hyped fight - this time between Ortiz and Shamrock that, again, is credited with getting someone back into UFC - this time Shamrock.

What makes this DVD so disappointing (in addition to the misleading title) is the fact that there's no footage from any of these fights. Instead we have to look at still photos to get a sense of the action. Perhaps Action Guy Films (the DVD distributors) couldn't afford the clips, but come on we wanna see the fights not a bunch of pictures. Everyone interviewed claims these were some of the biggest bouts in UFC history, so looking at still photos of them as opposed to actual clips just doesn't cut it. This is mainly a talking heads DVD that features a few brief interviews with Ortiz and even briefer ones with Shamrock. Though I originally bought this DVD for Ortiz, I came away from it wanting to see more of Shamrock. It is above all a vanity project for Ortiz's manager Sal Garcia who not only gets the most screen time, but who also takes the credit for getting Ortiz and Shamrock back into UFC. As one of the other interviewees says Garcia is a good looking guy, smart, savvy and a smooth talker. All of that is in evidence here so while Garcia is never boring, I'd prefer to see more of Ortiz and Shamrock.

Sadly, this is so often the case with budget DVDs that feature well known entertainers on the cover. Though they claim to shed some light on an important period in that artist's career through never-before-seen footage, they instead focus on background players who were lucky enough to be there and witness it firsthand. I say lucky enough because they know that later down the road they can sell their story for a profit to some obscure DVD company and gullible viewers will buy it.",1279324800,,2442,4.635103926096997
8129371,1,B000G8NVPM,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.  In this day and age where money and jobs are becoming less and less, you will get taken for the ride with this.  No fight footage really, most of this is based upon Tito and Guy Metzger. I understand this is the set up for the Shamrock, Ortiz fued, but very little time is even spent on this, most of this doc is about the ""T Shirt"" that ortiz wore.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS.",1247011200,,445,3.922222222222222

Very good interviews. Recommended for MMA fans in general, but especially for fans of Tito Ortiz or Ken Shamrock.",1239580800,,298,4.418181818181818
