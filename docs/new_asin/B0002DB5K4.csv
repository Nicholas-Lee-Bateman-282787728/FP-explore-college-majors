2078509,4,B0002DB5K4,"James Patterson's novels are full of twists and turns, and his 1ST TO DIE is no exception.  In translating this novel to the screen (Which by the way WAS a miniseries on NBC), the storyline is basically the same, with some changes for dramatic effect particularly in the denouement.

However, in bringing ""The Women's Murder Club"" to life, director Russell Mulcahy puts together a good cast:  Tracy Pollan as the police detective with a rare blood disease; Carly Pope as the cub reporter out to make the big story; Pam Grier as the feisty and loyal medical examiner; and Megan Gallagher as the district attorney (although Gallagher is given little to do in the screen version).  Gil Bellows as Pollan's love interest does well, as does Robert Patrick as egotistical novelist Nicholas Jenks.  Angie Everhart fills out the cast as Jenks' submissive and obedient wife.

The plot revolves around a serial killer who is killing newlyweds, and the detective and friends frantically tries to piece together the clues to come up with the culprit.  There are a couple of surprises near the end, but they are not the same as in the book, so if you've read the book, be prepared.  I think sometimes they change the murderer because they don't want the people who've read the book to know from the start who the killer is.  Anyway, not a bad adaptation.",1097452800,,1341,4.745689655172414
2078510,4,B0002DB5K4,"I agree this film was a sleeper, constantly keeping the viewer guessing throughout an intricate plot.  There were several conflicts to follow (two detectives who are former lovers, police investigation vs. persistent journalist, life-threatening blood disease of heroine, extremely clever murderer vs. an imposter, etc.).  Another pleasure was the beautiful Seattle coastline.",1092960000,6,376,6.211538461538462
2078511,5,B0002DB5K4,"This movie is a real sleeper. It is outstanding!

Just like all of Patterson's books. It is a true

mystery thriller. It keeps you on the edge of

your seat for the whole movie. It is really, really

good! You won't be disappointed. See it.",1091836800,5,240,4.266666666666667
2078512,2,B0002DB5K4,"I suggest you read the book before you watch this movie.  But if by some chance you happen to see this awful interpretation first,THE BOOK IS WAY BETTER! I cringe to hear that 2nd Chance will also be made into a TV movie.  James Patteron is such an exceptional author and  I just saw that this had so much potental as a screenplay and it failed horribly.  Wait to see Roses are Red, wich will be a major theatrical release.",1090800000,3,423,4.25

2078564,5,B0002DB5K4,"I really like the Women's Murder Club and Lynsay( the San Francisco policewoman) is one of my favorite characters in this series.  This is the ony one of the series they apparently put on video. I wish they would do the entiere series on video. I have read them all(about 9 or 10 in the series)!!! Waiting for more to come. So, James Patterson please add more to the Women's Murder Club and let us know what has happen with Lynsay's new marriage and the other characters(her other lady friends).",1377993600,3,495,4.5

2078571,4,B0002DB5K4,"... this happens to be a movie. As the dice fell, I got my hands on this one when I just was in the middle of watching (Patterson's) ""Women's Murder Club"" - and it was a very welcome surprise, this one is really good - in the sense that it catches the spirit of Patterson's book in a really good way, and, I may add: for the first time. ""Along came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"" were per se quite good films, but due to the age of M Freeman an important part of the story had to be omitted /what a schame, they didn't take Will Smith, for example, or even Denzel ... ok: In ""First To Die"" not only the age of the actors are okay according to the book, but also the characters and the directing; things, which are both sadly not found in the TV-Series ""Women's Murder Club"", for once, the decision not to continue with a second season is understandable. So, if you like James Patterson and want to see a movie which (almost) lives up to the written original - grab this one and forget all the others - Ernst Petz",1309392000,,1012,4.116161616161616
2078612,4,B0002DB5K4,"I have read 10 books of the Lindsay Boxer genre.  I enjoyed the Women's Murder Club on TV.  This movie shows how ""The Club"" got started and you have an idea on how to imagine what the girls may look like.  It brought some realism to the reading of the books.  I enjoyed it.",1289088000,,273,4.0
2078613,5,B0002DB5K4,"This was a movie that I couldn't find in the local stores, and as usual, Amazon had it and it was delivered in a prompt manner and in great condition.
I love shopping at Amazon.com",1282521600,,180,4.171428571428572
2078614,1,B0002DB5K4,"I loved how this movie stayed so close to the novel. James Patterson is an amazing writer, and the movie did some justice to his writing. My issue however was the casting, it was HORRIBLE. Bad acting was served all around, from Tracy Pollan's stiff, rigid interpretation as Boxer to the critique of the woman playing her friend Claire (which I'll save for another day, just know its some of the worst acting I've ever seen.) Pollan was horrible timing in her acting, inserting pauses and talking so slowly that if the director had sped her up, they could have shaved half an hour off the movie. Carly Pope is ALRIGHT, but nothing could save this movie. It does keep moving, and since I'm a huge fan of James Patterson, I stuck it out through the end in respect for him, but it was hard. If you can, find the Women's Murder Club series on the Internet starring Angie Harmon. Although it doesn't follow the storyline of the novels, I actually BELIEVE that these women could be the Women's Murder Club. If you're going to buy it, find a used copy for less than a dollar, that's what I did. The acting was impossible to come back from.

Also, I've never laughed as hard as when you see any clip of Jacobi, the guy who plays him is so horrible it's hilarious!",1266624000,4,1254,4.405172413793103
2078615,5,B0002DB5K4,"I am a huge fan of author James Patterson and this movie really depicted the images that I had in mind from reading the book by the same name.  Tracy Pollan shines as Det. Lindsay Boxer and does a really great job.  The movie itself is somewhat predictable to a certain degree but, in typical James Patters fashion, it is full of suspense and twists.  This movie is based on the first book of the Women's Murder Club series and fantastic.  (I wish they would make movies for the next 6 books that are currently in the series.)  If you like mysteries, James Patterson, Tracy Pollan or any combination of these, you will like this movie.",1216857600,2,635,4.439655172413793
2078616,4,B0002DB5K4,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I have not read any James Patterson novels, but this movie made me want to do so.  I enjoyed the twists and turns - definitely not predictable.",1183334400,,173,4.375
2078617,1,B0002DB5K4,"James patterson was probably shaking his head when he saw the final cut of this film let alone the script. Due to: First of all the main highlight of the Woman's Murder Club seires is that it takes place in San Francisco and in this movie you don't even know where this takes place,  Secondly the script and the movie as it goes along it goes more and more off the content and story of the fantasic book that it is (like for instance one of the characters of the Womans Murder Club in this movie was invented by the script writers, they repalced one of the characters with a fictional one and the one that is in the club ,in the book, was in the movie but as a side character).  DONT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A TRUE JAMES PATTERSON FAN. You the JP fan will probably use this DVD as an expensive coster for your drinks.

Cant wait for the ABC series of The Woman's Murder Club that will premier this fall.  Hopefully they will do the book series justis.",1179273600,,947,4.158469945355192

2078620,2,B0002DB5K4,"The same thing that made this movie such a great book, makes it a horrible movie.  The book gets right into the story.  It grabs you and holds on until the end.  The movie is the same, but gives you no time to get to know the characters.  If you are going to see this movie, I highly recommend reading the book instead.",1144368000,,319,4.015873015873016
2078621,4,B0002DB5K4,"This NBC Event Movie is a very close adaption of a James Patterson novel of the same name following the police investigation of the ""Bride and Groom"" murders led by Det. Lindsay Boxer, a cop with major problems of her own. This is a very good adaption, featuring a strong performance by Tracey Pollan as Lindsay in a twisty mystery. The only problem is the mis-casting of Robert Patrick as Nicholas Jenks. The part called for a less intense personality. I had hoped for another film, adapting the second book in the series, 2nd Chances, but, the plot perhaps was too similar to recent tragic events and may have been passed over.",1105920000,9,629,4.625
