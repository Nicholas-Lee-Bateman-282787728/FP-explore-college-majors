8306545,5,B001GPGFI4,"Wow!  Finally a DVD book that is really worth spending time and money on.  I never write product reviews, but I feel that I must show my support for this wonderful DVD.  The culture we live in can be punishing on all of us, but especially our pre-teens and teenagers.  As a mother, I try to do my best to teach and reflect real self-worth, truth, boundaries and the joy of truly being a unique individual to my children.  But as much as our children crave this message they often resist it from their own parents.  Lily's Truth is so beautifully presented in such an engaging way that the practical yet profound lessons have been very impactful to my family.  The fact that I can watch this DVD over and over myself and walk away with a fresh perspective on my own life is a testament to the ageless wisdom of Lily's Truth. I really believe that this is one of the best tools I have to maintain a dialog with my children on how to develop loving healthy relationships in all facets of their lives.  -Michelle Price",1223942400,,1014,4.3563829787234045
8306546,5,B001GPGFI4,"The information given in Lily's Truth can be used by so many people.  Young teens who seem unsure about the many things life is revealing to them along with being pulled in all directions by their peers, will find focus, self love, confidence, courage, spirital growth and much more, through the lessons and stories of the many characters in this DVD.  This amazing guide has helped me get on the right track to inner peace and acceptance of who I am, no matter how someone has made me feel or what they may have said.  It was fabulous!",1222732800,,536,4.448979591836735
