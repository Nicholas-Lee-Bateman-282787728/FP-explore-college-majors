I'm sorry, but you weren't going to get Robin Williams to voice the Genie in the TV series, but the stories were still good. I've been looking for the series for years.  Come on, Disney - open the vault!!!",1509235200,2,348,4.2727272727272725
8621584,3,B00GAAC8DQ,"Aladdin the series was good, but not as the movie. I only saw one episode, I can't even remember the name of it! The one thing I didn't like was the animation, is was pretty clumsy at times. The characters weren't as likable as they were in the movie. The one thing that disappointed me was that Robin Williams didn't come back as the voice of Genie. Homer Simpson's voice actor is back to doing the voice once again! Overall, not as good as the movie, but's still pretty decent.",1433635200,,479,4.333333333333333
