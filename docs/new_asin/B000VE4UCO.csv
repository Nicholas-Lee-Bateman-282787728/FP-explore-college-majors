2938806,4,B000VE4UCO,"While not classic Disney animation, these cartoons are far ahead of the other cartoons produced at the same time.  This is one of the most historic Disney DVD releases ever.  The loss of Oswald was the thorn in Walt's foot.  This drove Walt to change his business practices.  Sadly less than half of the Walt Disney produced Oswald Rabbit cartoons survive today.

The Hand Behind The Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story.

The Oswald cartoons will seem quite primitive to those used to the classic color Mickey & Donald Cartoons.  Even the B&W Mickey Mouse cartoons will seem more refined.  These might bore some children, but the Disney Treasures are for the real animation buffs and I would highly recomend this to any Disney fan!",1192406400,47,2537,4.575221238938053
2938807,5,B000VE4UCO,"They may be too primitive to enjoy for their entertainment value alone, but these 13 silent, black-and-white cartoons from the 1920s have a ton of historic value. They're what remains of the 26 shorts Walt Disney did just before Mickey Mouse, during 1927 and 1928. The animation team included a trio of future stars -- Ub Iwerks, who would go on to draw Mickey, Friz Freleng, who later drew many Bugs Bunny cartoons, and Rudy Ising, who went on to run Warner Brothers' Merrie Melodies unit.

Though he got off to a rocky start, Oswald was plenty popular. With the same engaging, spunky personality as his rodent successor, the Lucky Rabbit even had his own merchandise -- a chocolate-covered marshmallow Oswald candy bar, a stencil set and a pin-backed button. In 1928 Disney lost the rights to the rabbit to the shady distributor for Universal, replacing him with the very similar looking mouse we know and love today. Disney regained them in 2006, in exchange for allowing then-ABC television sportscaster Al Michaels to go to work for Universal's network, NBC.

The cartoons have new, orchestral soundtracks by Robert Israel, who earlier created the scores for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Harold-Lloyd-Comedy-Collection-Vols-1-3/dp/B000B5XORA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection Vols. 1-3</a>.

What makes the set terrific, however, are two unexpected additions. First, most of the shorts come with audio commentary, which really makes them interesting. Second, Disc 2 is a Academy Award quality (really!) documentary about Iwerks, called ""The Hand Behind the Mouse,"" that was produced by his granddaughter, Leslie. Since it wasn't created by the Disney company, it's an honest, balanced, warts-and-all portrayal. In fact, it's the best inside look at the history of company ever. Kelsey Grammar narrates.

Collectors will note that this Treasures set comes in a gold tin, not silver. Also included is a little lithograph that's a sampling of some Oswald sketches, and a cute little Oswald button.

By the way, some of the post-Disney Oswalds are also now available on DVD. After Disney lost the rights to the character, Universal assigned the Lucky Rabbit to animator Walter Lantz, of Woody Woodpecker fame. The new Woody compilation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Woody-Woodpecker-and-Friends-Classic-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B000PC1PAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection</a>, includes a handful of Lantz's Oswald shorts.",1188691200,85,2601,5.981182795698925
2938808,5,B000VE4UCO,I understand what you are saying but come on!! These are cartoons that are over 80 years old and have never been seen by most of the population. The main thing is that Oswald was Walt's first creation and we could have easily had Walt and Oswald holding hands in the hub at Disneyland!!,1188518400,5,286,4.314814814814815
2938809,3,B000VE4UCO,"This hasn't been released yet, but any potential purchasers should be aware of what they are getting.  Like the ""Alice"" comedies on the ""Disney Rarities"" disk, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is interesting for Disney fans because he is rare and historic, not because they are great cartoons. (In much the same way that Steamboat Willie is 'great' because it's the first Mickey and the first cartoon with synchronized sound but is not ... objectively a great cartoon.)  I've seen a few of the Oswald cartoons and they are NOT really  very good. Storylines are basic in the extreme, animation is crude, and characterization non-existant. But, if you are one of those Disneyphiles or History buffs (like me), I'm sure you'll buy this set anyway! If you're looking for sophisticated and entertaining cartoons that you'll be able to watch over and over again, save  your money.",1188518400,44,865,4.944827586206896
2938810,5,B000VE4UCO,Great Classic!,1440892800,,14,6.5
2938811,5,B000VE4UCO,the cartoons are the bonus feature for me. Best documentary I've seen since marwencol. It shows just how great iwerks was and how a great man can make a bad decision. He not only co created the biggest icon in almost 2000 years but was also a special effects and film pioneer. He made great cartoons outside of Disney. Balloon land is my personal favorite. His story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. I really don't think Walt could have done it without him and I think Walt knew that. The doc alone is worth the purchase. I like the toons but black and white oldies are only done in small doses for me. I just grew up with color so that's where my nostalgia lies. I bought the set based on reviews about the iwerks story and I was not disappointed. Plus the tin is cool.,1439251200,,777,4.328767123287672

2938814,5,B000VE4UCO,"While most people know that Walt Disneys star really rose with the advent of Mickey Mouse, not as many people are familiar with his animated shorts before Mickey.  Immediately before Mickey, he and his animators were working on shorts starring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, but that work came to an abrupt halt when his distributor decided to cut Walt out of the process, something he could do since he owned the rights to the character.  It wasn't until 2006 that the Disney Company got back the rights to Oswald, and they wasted little time in releasing this two disc The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit collection in 2007.

Walt only worked on 26 cartoons starring Oswald, and only 13 of them are preserved here.  Since Disney didn't own anything having to do with these cartoons, the company has had to track down any prints they can and restore them if at all possible.  I have a feeling that these 13 are the only ones they had tracked down as of the release of the set.  As to the prints themselves, they look good, especially considering they are 80 years old.  Yes, there are issues a few times, but most of it is not that noticeable.

Since Oswald was originally a silent cartoon series, they asked a composer to create some silent era soundtracks to accompany the cartoons.  These certainly feel like the music you might have heard in those old theaters and it adds to the viewing experience.  Ill admit I wish we had the option to watch one or two truly silent for the novelty, but maybe thats just me.

What about the cartoons themselves?  They were all done in 1927 and 1928, and they are actually pretty fun.  As with the early Mickeys there is little continuity between shorts, so in one Oswald is in a transatlantic plane race and in the next hes working on a trolley, a member of the Mounties, or fighting to win the hand of his love in Medieval times.  While the animation is certainly not up to todays standards, it is easy to find the humor in many of the site gags.  I enjoyed watching them.

There are other similarities between Oswald and the early Mickeys.  Oswald at times looks like a long eared Mickey, and his love interest, a rabbit at times a cat most of the time, wears a costume similar to early Minnie.  Finally, the heavy is Putrid Pete, and one of his aliases is Peg Leg Pete.

In the way of extras, the first disc has commentaries from animation historians on six of the titles, a fragment of another one, a short documentary on Disneys loss and regain of Oswald, and a stills gallery.

So whats on the second disc?  It is devoted to Ub Iwerks.  The majority of this disc is an hour a half documentary on his life called The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story put together by his granddaughter.  Ub was a friend of Walts who was an animator at the studio during this time.  In fact, he singlehandedly did the animation on the first few Mickey Mouse cartoons.  Later, he tried opening his own studio before going back to work for Disney in the special effects department.  The documentary is an interesting look at a life that all Disnerds have heard of but few really know.  Rounding out the disc are three of the Alice shorts that Ub worked on, plus the first two Mickeys and the Silly Symphony Skeleton Dance that was all his.  Its a chance to really see his work, and I appreciated not having to track these shorts down from other collections in the series.

Honestly, I think this collection will appeal more to the die-hard Disney fanatics.  For most Disney fans, Oswald is an interesting footnote along the way.  But those who are interested in all things Disney will love getting to see these early efforts.  Plus, they are entertaining.

So The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit isn't for everyone.  But those who are interested will really enjoy what they find here.",1432512000,3,3825,4.511627906976744

2938819,5,B000VE4UCO,"These are of great historical value being this is the character Walt Disney developed right before Mickey Mouse. They are not particularly funny but you can definitely see Mickey in Oswald - at least the early Mickey!

The Oswald stories have a lot in common with the early Mickey toons especially storywise. And Oswald is very similar to Mickey in term of his actions and even his appearence. Of course the stories are faily primative as are the first Mickeys until Walt nailed down his personality, etc.

Are they toons I will watch over and over? No - they are not. BUT they are important toons being at the very start of Disney's amazing run!! Any serious cartoon collector should have this in their collection - and should watch them at LEAST once in a while just to remember where the great toons came from!

Highly recommended -- I would rate these overall a 8.75 to 9.25 of 10 stars!",1407888000,,891,4.55625

2938823,5,B000VE4UCO,"The final release of Wave 7 welcomes home Walt's very first hit cartoon character.......or should I say Ub Iwerks character? A name only known by vintage cartoon fans, Ub Iwerks was Walt's ""Genie in the lamp"" so to speak and was an innovator not only in animation, but many camera and special effects that are still used today. While this set is entitled Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, maybe it should be called Oswald and Ub, Walt's two friends he parted ways with for a while.

Walt Disney learned an early lesson with Oswald, having him stolen out from under him with about 99 percent of his art staff. The only member, a very important member ,Ub Iwerks stuck by Walt and together they created the one and only Mickey Mouse! I really don't think Iwerks has been given the credit he deserves for his contributions to animation. Not only did he come up with Mickey's appearance and signature ears, he invented many techniques used in filming animation and special effects used by Disney and the film industry. He and Walt had a difference of opinion, so the two went their separate ways to work on their own projects. Ten years would pass before the power duo would reunite at the Disney studio.

The first disc holds the 13 of 26 surviving original Disney Oswald shorts, The 14 minute 'Oswald Comes Home' is the main feature in the bonus section on disc one. The feature explains how Walt lost the character and how the Disney company was able to obtain him 80 years later. The shorts themselves look very good considering their history. Being neglected by Universal in storing them with care, I think Disney did a fine job presenting these precious historic cartoons.

The second disc has one main feature, but it is a fantastic documentary about Ub Iwerks which is worth the price alone. This tells the story of the man that many Disney fans may not even know about. Walt may have been able to make history without him, but he was so much better with this man by his side. The rest of the disc is made up of early shorts that Ub worked on with Disney, The cartoon shorts have been released on earlier ""Treasures"" sets, but they do make sense to be added here. They include two of the first three Mickey Mouse shorts. The Skeleton Dance is also here as an early Silly Symphony choice. As pointed out by a fellow Ammie member, the 3 Alice shorts are new to DVD release.

Considering this was a set that I thought was going to be one of my least favorites, I was proven wrong and I found the content to be completely engrossing. The shorts are very funny with no dead space and the documentary taught me much about a man I knew little about, Ub Iwerks, who was way ahead of his time.

This is a no brainer for animation and Disney buffs, it may not appeal to those who can't sit through silent cartoons, but for those who appreciate the early beginnings of animation and the fact that this little character found his way home to Disney after an 80 year prison sentence, it is a true treasure........I guess that little rabbit was very ""lucky"" after all?...very lucky indeed! ;-)",1378339200,3,3074,4.511669658886894

2938827,5,B000VE4UCO,"My daughter absolutely LOVES Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, so I was happy to find this Disney Treasures DVD at a reasonable price.

Oswald is making something of a comeback with Disney, most noticeably in his newly established presence at Disneyland Park in Anaheim. Oswald merchandise is beginning to show up, and Oswald even has his own name-branded store in the new ""Buena Vista Street"" area of California Adventure, which just completed a major overhaul of its attractions and environs.

Most people don't know that Oswald was a Walt Disney creation that predated Mickey, that Walt lost the rights to Oswald and that the Disney Company recently reacquired the rights to this early Disney character. In fact, up until a year or so ago, few clerks manning the stores at Disneyland had ever heard of Oswald. That's changed.

Thus, the issue of this DVD set, which really belongs in every Disneyphiles collection.

Now, if only Disney would reissue the entire tin-boxed ""Treasures"" series on BluRay!

Disney now has Oswald back in their control and you can find him all over the Parks now.

2938842,5,B000VE4UCO,"The collection of Walt Disney's first animated star 'Oswald' the Lucky Rabbit are gems of the early technique of animation still in its infancy. The process of story and character are beginning to merge with the draftsmanship and movement to create a very unique art. Walt Disney's contribution of personality and acting and Ub Iwerks design and animation are rough and primitive by our standards today but, when they were originally released they caused a sensation. This popularity paved the way for more Disney productions and advancements in the animated film.
Though Walt lost the rights to Oswald and the shorts in some underhanded dirty dealing by a distributor, this just gave Disney more determination to succeed in the business. Ultimately, producing Mickey Mouse and the first sound cartoon 'Steamboat Willie' which is also included in the DVD set.
Especially enjoyable is the documentary by Leslie Iwerks, Ub's granddaughter. The film gives us insight to not only the process of creativity but, also into the relationship of two friends. Both Walt and Ub could not have produced the films alone, they needed, and indeed did complement each other. The documentary was, for myself, the highlight of the DVD collection.
On the whole, the collection is a valuable historical document. I commend the Disney organization for making these films available to us. The cartoons are sometimes amazingly hilarious too!",1265068800,,1418,5.223684210526316

With some 26 shorts created, Disney sought an increase in their budget for the series. He was not only turned down but instead had his budget cut by 20%. When Disney scoffed he was basically told too bad because Universal owned the character and had actually already hired away most of the animators who worked on the series.

The one animator who didn't leave was the great Ub Iwerks. With Oswald gone, he and Walt set about creating a new character. That character would become the symbol of Disney, Mickey Mouse. Mickey was, at first, pretty much a pure copy of Oswald. Universal would continue to produce Oswald shorts for another ten years, picking Walter Lantz, best known as the creator of Woody Woodpecker, to produce them. Ironically, during his later years, Oswald would be softened a bit and end up resembling Mickey Mouse.

Now here is where it gets interesting...In 2006, ABC, which is owned by Disney, lost the rights to NFL football. Monday Night Football broadcaster, Al Michaels, asked to be released from his contact at ABC so he could join his partner, John Madden at NBC. Disney agreed but only if the rights to Oswald Rabbit were returned to them. Thus, I'm pretty sure this was the only time in history a broadcaster was traded for a cartoon character...I think Disney got the better of the deal.

Naturally Disney set about putting together a Treasures collection for Oswald. The only trouble is that only 13 of the original 26 shorts could be found and their quality differs quite a bit. This set features all 13 of the Oswald shorts and is filled out with several ""Alice"" shorts (Disney's first animated star) and also some early Mickey Mouse shorts including ""Plane Crazy"" the first Mickey Short, and ""Steamboat Willie"" the first Mickey short featuring sound.

While the animation on the Oswald cartoons is somewhat crude it's also very inventive with unique perspectives and shadowing effects. This is best exemplified in ""Oh what a Knight"" as Oswald tries to rescue his sweetheart from a castle, engaging in a sword battle with her father. Oswald periodically hands his sword to his shadow to continue the fight while he goes and smooches his girl. It's quite well done and one of the best looking shorts in the collection.

I also enjoyed ""All Wet"" in which Oswald is selling hot dogs at a beach (and the hot dogs keep trying to escape). When the cute girl rabbit pays him no attention he pays off the lifeguard to do his job and the girl fakes drowning in order to get Oswald to rescue her.

""Bright Lights"" is another frantic bit of hilarity as Oswald sneaks backstage at a show and hides in a box that turns out to be a tiger's cage. Soon the Tiger is chasing Oswald throughout the theater.

The complete list of shorts includes:

Trolley Troubles

Oh, Teacher (with commentary by Mark Kausler)

The Mechanical Cow

Great Guns!

All Wet

The Ocean Hop (with commentary by Mark Kausler)

Rival Romeos

Bright Lights (with commentary by Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck)

Ozzie of the Mounted (with commentary by Jerry Beck)

Oh What A Knight (with commentary by Leonard Maltin and Mark Kausler)

Sky Scrapers

The Fox Chase (with commentary by Jerry Beck)

Tall Timber

Featurettes include ""Oswald Comes Home"" a history of the character and ""The Works of Ub Iwerks"".

Oswald isn't the ""Holy Grail"" of animation finds that some may claim but it's certainly nice to have them back at Disney where they can be seen for the first time in decades.",1208131200,7,3658,4.74565560821485

2938848,4,B000VE4UCO,"The best thing about any Walt Disney Treasures set is the introduction by Leonard Maltin.  I'll confess, I own several of these sets, but have watched nary a one all the way through.  One thing is certain, though, and that is that I've seen Maltin's introductions a few times.  He has such an enthusiasm for all things Disney, and his introductions do a spectacular job of preparing the viewer for the following footage, as well as provide insights into the wonderful world of Walt Disney that give the viewer a sense of being ""in the know.""

Of course, the Oswald cartoons are truly treasures.  I think it's a fairly well-known fact that Oswald was Disney's first featured cartoon character, but that the rights to those cartoons were held by the company that published them, and therefor lost to the Disney company.  The reason this collection is now available is that Buena Vista has finally recovered these cartoons.  Because they were not managed by Disney, the quality of many of the original prints have been compromised.  The damage to the film is visible all throughout the set, but it's still exciting just to see these pieces of the Disney legacy, knowing how long it has been since anyone saw them.

This is definitely a good buy.",1202428800,2,1242,4.73953488372093

2938850,5,B000VE4UCO,"After I ordered this set, I was sad that the first Mickey Mouse volume was out of print, because I was quite curious to see the first few Mickeys that followed Oswald.

Fortunately... those early Mickey cartoons are included here as bonus extras! There's also a great look at Oswald as well as the work of Ub Iwerks. And the cartoons... it's such a great look at the early forms of animation. They're still quite enjoyable to see. It's too bad that the original versions of some of these no longer exist... on the commentaries it is talked about how some things are changed. Either way, the fact that something 80 years old still would exist for us to watch at all is great.",1199836800,3,674,4.435483870967742

2938852,5,B000VE4UCO,"I have four daughters, ages 6, 4, 3, and 1. They have been watching all of the animated Disney Treasures for about 2 years now (with the exception of Goofy since I have not yet purchased it). One of my 1 year old's first words was ""Disney."" They have seen everything from Plane Crazy through Runaway Brain, and everything in between.

When I purchased Oswald, I assumed due to the reviews and lack of talking that my daughters would not take to this as well as the others. After my oldest finished watching the final short, she asked me to guess what Disney character was her favorite. Of course, she chose Oswald, and she is not the type to constantly change ""favorites"" of anything.

First, my daughters and I absolutely love the weiner dog in the early Disney shorts, and it appears that Oswald made good use of him as well. This may cause some bias in favor of Oswald. Second, Oswald makes use of everything on the screen, including the written words from screams as he has no voice. This is unexpected and very funny. Third, his use of his own body parts cause some great moments as well.

The extras are great, explaining the situations that caused Walt to lose Oswald and, as always, inside looks into Disney Studios. This time, we get a closer look at the great Ub Iwerks, which is long overdue.

Overall, I guess it would depend on your children as to whether they will like this. My children love the old black and white Disney shorts as much as the color, with their favorites being ""Orphan's Benefit"" and ""Skeleton Dance."" There are obviously some quality problems, but in all reality they are not that bad. I give this five stars as I can't imagine Disney being able to do anything more with what they had to work with, and the cartoons are funny.",1198886400,3,1760,4.490625
2938853,5,B000VE4UCO,"Lately I've been reviewing a whole bunch of DVDS that, for some strange reason, have titles and packaging which hide the real gems inside the boxes. This latest volume in the ""Disney Treasures"" series is just another one. NO.. I'm not saying not to buy it. You should. I'm just harping on Disney for keeping the prize hidden inside.

In this case the ""prize"" is the wonderful two -hour documentary on UbIwerks made in 1999 by his granddaughter, Leslie, which was out on VHS but is long out of print. Yet, surprisingly, this whole ""Oswald"" set should have been called ""Ub Iwerks: The Link between Walt and Mickey (featuring Oswald and Alice)"". THAT would have said something. The documentary takes up more time than all the Oswald cartoons included, and it's fabulous. You'll learn about all the work he did when he created his own studio. (In fact this documentary led me to seek out more of Iweks films. And you'll learn how he is the one who made Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" work! This documentary should have been promoted more.

But as to Oswald, the cartoons are well done and the prints are decent. (As you'll learn in another short featurette, they had to see out existing prints as most of the originals were discarded.) And the story of how Oswald was re-acquired by Disney in a trade for a TV sports commentator is fascinating.

I'm glad that Disney is reissuing this material in these nice collectors sets and only wish they'd come out more often. If nothing else, you need this volume to learn more about, not Walt, but Ub and the amazing things he did!

2938854,4,B000VE4UCO,"I have enjoyed each one of the WD Treasure series, but this one is the most difficult to write about. Historically, this set is a must have for Disney fans who want to see the origin of not only Mickey Mouse, but what shaped and made Walt the man that he became. Losing the Oswald character made Walt a lot more careful in his future endeavors, and most likely was one of the biggest early turning points in his career. The Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck sets from this series have spillover appeal; those who enjoy cartoons will watch those sets and have lots of enjoyment. The Oswald films, while advanced for their day, have limited technical and story appeal to the audience of today. Quite frankly, the Oswald character is not half as enjoyable, cute, or charming as Mickey Mouse. Still, it is easy to see early glimmers of brilliance in some of these cartoons, and knowing what else was around at the time, they truly are technical milestones.

This set comes in a gold-colored tin and includes a reproduction of the pencil drawings from a ""lost"" Oswald cartoon, ""Sagebrush Sadie,"" a Certificate of Authenticity, and a reproduction button. The button is a curious addition; rattling around in the tin, it somewhat cheapens the set. The reproduction card includes 6 small drawings on one card; personally, one larger image that showed more detail would have been preferable.

The real gem in this set is Leslie Iwerk's 2 hour documentary on her grandfather, Ub, ""The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story."" The relationship between Disney and Iwerks goes back to Kansas City where the two worked together in their youth. Iwerks was the top animator of the day, and much of the early Disney success is credited to him, as he was the man who drew Oswald and Mickey. Iwerks eventually struck out on his own, but came back to Disney in the 1940's and he and Walt continued to create magic together until Walt's death. Iwerks was a technical genius; he created the multiplane camera and helped improve the quality of live action films married to cartoons (""Mary Poppins""). He was also instrumental in the Hitchcock movie, ""The Birds;"" Tippi Hedren describes how there were virtually no live birds in one of the sequences; it was all due to Iwerks' animation effects that make you believe the family is being attacked in their living room. There are also a number of Alice comedies (before Oswald choices) and early Mickey/Silly Symphony (after Oswald choices) to watch. The amount of growth between Alice and The Skeleton Dance is stunning. This set also includes a brief featurette on the history of Oswald and his ""homecoming"" back into the Disney fold, as well as a very cool sequence from the aforementioned ""Sagebrush Sadie"" lost cartoon (created entirely using pencil sketches).

The only reason this set gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the cartoons themselves. Historically, it is important to preserve them, but whether everyone will need to own this tin is debatable. Still, Disney has done a very nice job with this collection.",1198281600,4,3046,4.787072243346008
2938855,5,B000VE4UCO,"To most hardcore cartoon geeks (including myself) who knew about these films through cartoon history books, these have been on the must-see list for years! In my case, it's partially personal. My Dad (who was also an animation aficinado) was born in 1922 and remembered seeing the Oswald toons as a kid. He would tell me stories about the crazy things Oswald did with his ears and in his adventures.

Now that I've finally seen these for myself-here goes. Ozzie RULES! These cartoons really do live up to the hype! Don't buy that stuff about them being ""crude,"" as the abominations ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"" are not exactly DaVinci. Some of the animation of the heroic hare is quite sophisticated even by modern standards. But as for the toons themselves. TROLLEY TROUBLES is an amusing slap-happy number with our hare on a runaway train. Some of the future Looney Tunes crew worked on these cartoons, and it shows. GREAT GUNS is a hilarious WW1 satire. Love the scenes where the cannon's mouth takes up the entire screen and the warplanes fight by hitting each other with their wings.

THE MECHANICAL COW is an interesting mixture of gags and character study (which tends to evolve as these cartoons progress). The title character is quite likeable as he assits our hare. BRIGHT LIGHTS is a fascinating number. The neon sign in the first scene is a visual delight and the heroic hare tries to sneak back stage to meet ""Madame Zulu"" (a takeoff on Josephine Baker, perhaps?). The sly dog (er, rabbit) even tries to squeeze her booty in a pre-code moment (there is a lot of what a commentator calls ""barnyard humor"" in these cartoons, but none of it will really offend anybody today but the most prudish and PC of viewers). OZZIE OF THE MOUNTED obviously has a few skips on this print, but that does not overtly distract from this crazy chase story that predates Dudley Do-right by 4 decades. OH TEACHER is quite inventive, and the last gag involving the bully is quite hilarious!

Overall, we can see why the Oz was so popular in 1927-28. Uncle Walt, Ub Iwerks, and the early Looney Tunes crew gave the beloved bunny (admittedly not as agressive as Bugs would become) a personality that viewers could identify with mixed with outrageous and inventive stories. They make you smile as well as laugh. It makes one long for the lost 13 Oswalds that have yet to be found (an extremely rare pencil test for the lost SAGEBRUSH SADIE is shown, which gives a good idea of what it was like).

As for the extras-The Ub Iwerks documentary is interesting, but tends to drag in some parts with the overemphasis on technical details. A few complete FLIP THE FROG cartoons would have helped. Three Aice cartoons, including my favorite (next to Alice's Egg Plant with the hilarious Communist chicken Little Red Henski which is elsewhere on DVD) ALICE GETS STUNG. The gag involving the mother rabbit (no obvious relation to Oz or Bugs) telling a sob story to Julius the cat is one of the most touchingly funny moments of early animation. Two very early Mickeys from 1928 are here, PLANE CRAZY and the legendary (if overrated in my view) STEAMBOAT WILLIE (the funnier GALLOPING GAUCHO, which is elsewhere on DVD, would be included if I had my druthers).

In either case, this DVD marks the end of a truly triumphant year for cartoon collectors and gives us much cause to shout. Thank you Walt, thank you Ub, and yes, even you Leonard Maltin.",1197936000,6,3425,4.6827242524916945
2938856,5,B000VE4UCO,"When I opened the package and looked at the booklet, I was thrilled to see that the wonderful documentary ""Ub Iwerks: The Hand Behind the Mouse"" was the main bonus feature on disc 2. This is the full 90-minute version previously released on VHS, not the shortened version shown on some PBS stations years ago. I hadn't seen anything about this bonus feature in any of the promotional materials for the Oswald set. Having a DVD copy of this great documentary, to me, is worth the price of the entire set. What a great surprise!",1197590400,,526,4.5473684210526315
2938857,5,B000VE4UCO,"It has taken almost 80 years but at last Oswald The Lucky Rabbit is back where he belongs...at Disney. This new 2 DVD set is valuable on many levels. It's not only a missing piece of animation history but a look into the history of animation. Disc 2 contains the 1999 documentary THE HAND BEHIND THE MOUSE: THE UB IWERKS STORY which traces the beginnings of Walt Disney and his top animator/innovater from their early days in Kansas City through Walt's death in 1966 and Ub's in 1971. If you've ever wondered why Disney became so overprotective of its properties, it all started with Oswald while Walt was at Universal. Disney didn't own the rights to the character which was created in 1927 and in 1928 when he asked for a raise he was ordered to take a paycut. Walt and Ub quit in disgust and came up with a new character named Mickey Mouse and the rest as they say...is history. Never again would Walt not own any of his characters (or the rights to purchased ones like Winnie The Pooh).

There are 13 Oswald cartoons in this set (about half of those made) and they are an absolute delight to watch. Although the drawing style is crude, they are so chock full of crazy ideas and visuals that sometimes it takes your breath away. Unlike the early Mickey Mouse cartoons which suffer in comparison to what he later became, Oswald seems fresher than ever. In fact he's so old that he's new! Since these are silent cartoons (Oswald was originally based on Douglas Fairbanks Sr.), they require musical accompaniment and silent film specialist Robert Israel has come up with some rousing and colorful background scores that add to the fun. Attractively packaged and reasonably priced for what you get, OSWALD THE LUCKY RABBIT deserves a place in any animation fan's library and now is the time with the Holidays upon us.

POSTSCRIPT: If you want to see what happened to Oswald in the Sound Era, check out Universal's WOODY WOODPECKER AND FRIENDS DVD set. You see the animator who took over after Disney quit was a young fellow named Walter Lantz and he made Oswald cartoons until the early 1940s when another character supplanted him. ""Guess who? Ha Ha Ha HA ha!""",1197331200,4,2159,4.619791666666667
2938858,5,B000VE4UCO,"I am an animation buff so I'm happy to see these on video finally. A bit of history. Cartoons that pre-date ol' Mickey.

But I'm also a huge football fan and I just wanted to tell you a bit of trivia about this. When Monday Night Football left ABC and went to ESPN last year and became a so-so match-up, NBC was awarded the marquee game of the week for its Sunday Night Football. Naturally NBC wanted to keep the Monday Night ""feel"" with the hosts John Madden and Al Michaels. They got Madden but Michaels was under contract to ABC.

So where am I going with all this? Well Disney owns ABC (and ESPN). And NBC owns Universal. And Uncle Walt made Oswald for Universal back in the 1920's and when he left to start his own studio, he couldn't take Oswald with him. Essentially Mickey was a clone of Oswald.

And for 80 years Disney has wanted them back. So when NBC came to ABC about getting Al Michaels for Sunday Night Football, a deal was struck. ""You can have Michaels if we can have Oswald.""

Some might be offended or shocked by this unlikely trade but both made off pretty well. I would estimate these cartoons are priceless in the eyes of Disney but they'll still generate millions in revenue. And so will Sunday Night Football for NBC.",1193961600,4,1241,4.359307359307359
8218340,5,B000VE4UCO,"Oswald is an interesting chapter in the Disney saga. Prior to 2006, the company did not own the character nor the films he starred in. Fans were largely familiar with him as a Walter Lantz character and only knew of Disney's association with the character in various books.

This Treasure was the first time that Disney's surviving Oswald cartoons were compiled together for an official media release. At the time only 13 of the 26 films were accessible and released. For material that supposedly wasn't well preserved, these transfers look excellent, especially having not been sourced from the original camera negatives. There's a notation at the end of each film noting where the print came from.

Disc two features a documentary on Ub Iwerks, Oswald's principle animator and creator of Mickey Mouse. It looks at his entire career and relationship with Walt. In addition, there's three Alice Comedies that were previously unreleased, and new transfers of STEAMBOAT WILLIE, THE SKELETON DANCE, and PLANE CRAZY. There's a pencil test for a complete scene of SAGEBRUSH SADIE, a film that's still considered lost. I find it amazing that artwork like that still exists for these films.

The good news is that in the years since this Treasure came out, more previously lost Oswald films have been discovered. As of this writing the number of extant films (in varying completeness) has increased to 19. There's a few researchers that are hard at work searching for lost Oswald's and other missing Disney silents. Disney, from my understanding, is also in on this search, and I'm hoping that they're planning a comprehensive release of their Silent films for Bluray in the near future.

In the meantime, Dave Bossert, one of the historians who is tracking down these films, has written a book on the Oswald films which is a must read.

8218345,5,B000VE4UCO,"Well, this set has been out for nearly 10 years, and I only just got around to viewing the whole thing, but at least it is still available for purchase at an... acceptable price as I write this. For an old Disney Treasures set, I mean. If memory serves, and I could be mistaken, this set is from the final wave of Walt Disney Treasures, a line that, in all honesty, could still be coming out today if only the Disney gods smiled upon us. I mean, there is plenty of material, tons of material, aching for a release to us hardcore Disney fans. But, I digress. This particular set is ""The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,"" and it's pretty sweet.

First, typically, the two-disc set comes in a Disney Treasures tin. Atypically, the tin this time around is gold in color. Only two other Disney Treasures sets came in colored tins, and those are the two volumes of Zorro, whose tins were black. Within the tin is also included an Oswald button that I believe is intended as a replica of original Oswald merchandise. Included within the disc case is also a lovely card featuring drawings from a lost Oswald short. Also included is a certificate of authenticity and the standard Treasures program guide.

Now, what's on the two discs? Well, Disc one features 13 of Walt Disney's original Oswald cartoons, plus some bonus feature material. These are all the Oswald cartoons in the set, as the second disc is entirely devoted to arguably Walt's most important animator ever, Ub Iwerks, focusing on a feature-length documentary created by his granddaughter, and supplemented by some of his non-Oswald Disney shorts (Alice and Mickey stuff). More on that later.

So, why only 13 of Walt's original 26 Oswald cartoons? Well, most of the others are no longer known to exist, tragically. Then again, they can turn up anytime. As I understand it, 4 more Disney Oswald shorts DO exist (Poor Papa, Africa Before Dark, Sleigh Bells and Hungry Hobos), at least two of those having been rediscovered after this DVD release (though not sure why the other two weren't on here). One of those newly rediscovered shorts, ""Hungry Hobos"", was supposed to be included as a bonus feature on the latest Snow White blu-ray release. I have no idea if that happened or not. I was content with the first blu-ray release. Now that I've heard this, though, I need to look into it. Anyway, what we do get here are the shorts: Trolley Troubles, Oh Teacher, Great Guns!, The Mechanical Cow, The Ocean Hop, All Wet, Rival Romeos, Bright Lights, Ozzie of the Mounted, Oh What a Knight, Sky Scrappers, The Fox Chase and Tall Timber. These are black and white, silent cartoons from 1927 and 1928 (though they have wonderful new music added), so they are probably not going to be entertaining to the average small children. Granted, I enjoyed cartoons even this old as a kid, but, well, ya never know, I guess. These are going to be of most interest to adults with a serious interest in Disney and animation/film history. They are primitive for sure, but they are very interesting and entertaining in the proper mindset. Overall, they are similar to the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons, and even the character is similar (not just in appearance), and this probably shouldn't be surprising, though these all seem more raw. Perhaps it's largely due to their condition. Though nothing presented here is unwatchable, and these also include some excellent commentary tracks in the bonus features section. A gallery of promotional materials is included as well, and a featurette on Oswald and his return to the Disney Studios in 2006 after being owned by Universal for decades (since he was stolen away from Walt by Charles Mintz).

As I mentioned, Disc 2 is focused on Ub Iwerks, Walt's most loyal animator during the early days, who was the only one who stuck with him when Oswald and the rest of Walt's staff were stolen away by Mintz. Ub was crucial to Walt Disney's success, was a key animator on the Oswald shorts, and as we discover in the documentary on disc 2, pretty much created Mickey. ""The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story"" is the feature-length documentary here, produced by Ub's own granddaughter, released by Disney apparently (the castle logo is there on the beginning and end), and narrated by a fave in my family, Kelsey Grammer of Cheers and Frasier fame. It's a fantastic film that gives a good education on the man. I learned things I didn't know myself, even after having watched and loved ""Walt Before Mickey"". In fact, I learned through this documentary that Walt Before Mickey, as wonderful as it is, still sticks to legend in some aspects of Walt's early story. Well, hey, it's a film, not a documentary. As for this documentary though, yeah, it's excellent, and as far as I know, it was only previously available on VHS, so I was so happy to discover I owned it in this set just the other day, upon finally cracking it open. I own all the treasures sets, but I think this was the only one I hadn't viewed yet. It was a very enjoyable surprise. As for bonus features on disc two, we are treated to some of Ub's Disney shorts from just before and just after the Oswald days: Alice Gets Stung, Alice in the Wooly West, Alice's Balloon Race, Mickey's Plane Crazy and Steamboat Willie, and the Silly Symphony, The Skeleton Dance. All are great fun and wonderful examples of Ub's magnificent work.

This set is pretty much a must for the animation lover and the Disney fanatic. Or the Ub Iwerks fanatic! It's fascinating, entertaining, educational, and a bit of a miracle after all these years.
