8717111,5,B00XZ99XGK,"Seemed like a pretty simple workout, but I actually had some muscle soreness in my thighs the next day! I'm 59, used to exercise like a fiend, then had some life events that disrupted by fitness activities. I gained a lot of weight and became diabetic. So now I have 60-70 pounds to lose and my energy level is in the basement. This workout is just the right length for me, somewhat difficult but not so hard that I am discouraged, and it's effective because I could feel that I actually still had some muscles the next day. Natalie Jill is very encouraging and enthusiastic so the time goes by quickly. I really like this workout.",1486857600,6,631,4.448275862068965

8717116,5,B00XZ99XGK,These workouts are great for beginners!  If you are just staring out these are the workouts for you and all you need is a chair.  As with all of Natalie's workouts she gives you several variations so that you can customize to your strength levels.,1457740800,9,247,4.466666666666667
8717117,5,B00XZ99XGK,"I have been using Natalie's programs for over a hear now.  I had injured my back and was not able to work out for quite some time.  Following Natalie Jill's Total Body Weight Beginner DVD, I was able to build up my core, my strength, and my stamina.  I have been pain free for almost a year now, and I owe a lot of my progress to following Natalie's programs.  This is a great video if you haven't worked out for awhile and/or want to build up your core.  The workouts may seem short, but they definitely pack a punch!",1457568000,10,518,4.14
8717118,5,B00XZ99XGK,"This DVD is a great place to start if you are new to working out or haven't worked out in a while.  In this DVD Natalie teaches you how to modify exercises and build your strength.  Through doing this workout I was able to work up to doing strong push-ups and planks.  I highly recommend this DVD!  If your more advanced....check out REV 4, Building Abs and Advanced workouts by Natalie.  This DVD had me doing those workouts in no time.  I'm down 20 lbs and 22.5"" in 2.5 months thanks to Natalie and her fitness and nutrition programs",1457568000,9,535,4.353535353535354
