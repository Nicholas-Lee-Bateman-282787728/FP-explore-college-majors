8670808,5,B00M8UTZXI,"This 1997 film is WAY ahead of its time.  One of Chris Marker's best.  Chris spent a lot of time in both Japan and Okinawa and this film presents a gripping account of the Battle of Okinawa from both the US and Japanese perspective, predating Clint Eastwood's work on this by several years.  But the film is told from the perspective of a female video game developer communicating to her boss/lover about the challenges and ethical issues associated with making this battle into a video game.  Extraordinary!",1484092800,,508,4.804597701149425

8670811,3,B00M8UTZXI,"This film by Chris Marker is a filmic essay by one of the left bank filmmakers as opposed to one of the New Wave directors. Marker is not an auteur director like them,he merely `conceives and edits' his films. Like Godard Marker is concerned with the meaning of the image,but whereas Godard overloads the image with meaning,visually and aurally, the meaning of Marker's images is being forever stripped away,and any trace of his `authorship' with it. The images are like the grin of Macavity the mystery cat whose structuring remains invisible. Marker is not a `creator' but an arranger, ordering the trace remnants of a felt but invisible past with present tools. He continues explorations of the interactions among history,memory and the visual image.

Presented as a series of video feed confessionals by Laura(Catherine Belkhodja)to her recently deceased lover, frustrated over her inability to reconstruct a video game left unfinished by the deceased,a computer artist,in whom she continues to relate within the computer. Laura struggles with the game because she knows she cannot truly reconstruct the Battle of Okinawa without living through it. We get her monologue,we see documentary footage, newsreels,menu screens,monitors,graphics of a clunky variety. Laura begins to reconstruct a true historical portrait of the decisive battle through information derived from a virtual global internet,Optional World Link (OWL),uniting her personal grief with a haunting reflection on war and human tragedy;not only the memories people have of such events,but on the memories technology stores on such events. We learn that civilian casualties out numbered military casualties,things like mass suicides and hara kiri were the piece sacrificed by the Japanese high command to offset a greater tragedy,in which it failed:the Atom bomb.

This is a hard film to understand,making several allusions to Resnais' films and its internet-fixated musings on the fate of historical memory and the heroine's memories of her partner are eroding daily. We explore the slippery border between computer, film and video work-all simply extensions of our attempts to interrogate images via new media an unknowable past. Total immersion into a perfect assimilation of the past leads to Laura's final recording: she increasingly magnifies the camera focus to the point of indeterminate abstraction,the ambiguity of an existential present state. Catherine Belkhodja gives a fascinating central performance,addressing the camera as she plays the game and the narration by an uncredited Chris Marker,is well delivered,informative and supplements the
'game' extremely well.",1331856000,9,2648,5.6175
