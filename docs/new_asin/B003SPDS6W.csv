4189239,4,B003SPDS6W,"Not one that I will remember for very long as it moved real fast and seemed to not have any deep underlying plot to take hold of you. On its own this is an okay anime but when compared to some of the more popular ones, all this has is action. There is hardly even any character development.
Even though it went fast and wasn't as in depth as I usually like, it was an entertaining show and I will pull it out again in about a year or two.",1373500800,,438,3.8777777777777778

I think that I watched the whole collection the day it landed at my door.

4189244,5,B003SPDS6W,"Coyote Ragtime Show is bursting with memorable characters, great action & all around humor that is conveyed well in either the English dub or (my preferred) original Japanese language.  Once I started the first disc I didn't want to turn it off.  The characters here have real camaraderie, sort of like Spike & Fay & Co in Cowboy Bebop.  ""Mister"" & his relationship with Swamp, the soulful black preacher, & his crew, bespectacled Bishop(the wry reminder to stay on task) & Katana (the excitable pilot) is hilarious, they're a group of guys always giving each other a hard time, even in dire situations, humor is used to balance the sense of urgency.  The villainous ""Marciano's 12 Sisters"" are a hilarious band of kawaii girl cyborgs with big guns, & an allegiance to their ""mother"", Madame Marciano, who is the Cruella DeVille of Space Criminals.  Lay back & let it unfold.  It's all about the caper-like feel of movies where 3 or 4 groups are all going after the same thing, in a race for their varied interests.  Of course you have your anime stereotype villains & heroes, but the writing is quite good, & it's just an overall fun show, I wish it had been a 600-650 minute series but sometimes the best shows are short & sweet.  Coyote Ragtime Show is nothing new, but it's all of the good stuff anime offers, in one show.",1328054400,,1326,4.588983050847458
4189245,4,B003SPDS6W,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Sci-Fi Action, Comedy,

Situations:  PG
Language:  PG+
Nudity:  -  None that I saw, no ""fan service"" either.
Violence:  PG+  Pretty violent but not very gory or explicit.

Language options: No seperate subtitle ability. Dub or Japanese with subtitles only.

Ads before menu CAN be skipped! Yay!

Special Features:
  Disc1: Production Artwork, On-air next episode previews (these aren't at the end of each episode for some reason) (just clips with music)
  Disc 2: Clean open/close, Also Available (previews) and the ones I watched weren't very informative either.

  This is an action-adventure in a future setting. The story revolves around a pirate/thief (Called ""Coyotes"", but the series isn't too good at differentiating between whether it's referring to the particular gang or all pirates in general, seems to do both at times.). He's known only as ""Mister"" (and by dozens of aliases). The basic plot is he's caretaker for a friend's daughter (the man once called the Pirate King) and the planet her inheritance is on is about to be destroyed. He arranges his jailbreak (he's in for drunk and reckless driving causing a 25 car pile-up) and gets a group together to save the girl's inheritance. The Guild (Organized Crime Syndicate) is also out for the ""treasure"" or at least a powerful rogue member is. Also in the way is the lady cop who's been after Mister for 4 years. And they're all headed into a war zone to find the treasure.
  There are some good ""edge of your seat"" moments and the fights are great (but a bit violent for children). I call it a comedy, but it's not jokes as much as situations that makes it so. It is one of the more enjoyable sci-fi animes I've seen in a while and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes anime, sci-fi, action-adventure, or even a little comedy.",1298246400,4,1858,4.801261829652997
4189246,1,B003SPDS6W,"This show had huge hype and buzz in the fan world - ""the next Cowboy Bebop"" etc.
We were really excited about the art and pre-ordered each DVD as it was announced. The first few episodes looked like the hype was spot-on but it very quickly descended into predictable and uninteresting routine. I'm not sure we even bothered to watch the last couple of episodes. I do know that my wife (who LOVES Cowboy Bebop) snored through most of them.
I'm sorry we bought the DVDs - we should have waited and rented them.",1295827200,5,508,4.414893617021277
4189247,5,B003SPDS6W,"One of the things I admire about this series is the way the story is paced, it neither drags or feels too long with each passing episode, though at the end after watching the final episode you, like me would want to see more. It's the magic that comes from this very anime.

Mixing various genres together like Scifi, Action, Adventure with a side order of Romance, this is a series that anyone can watch.

Mister is a wanted man, after breaking free from his prison. He along with his crew of coyotes are on a mission to find the treasure that was stolen from the Gigabanks and placed on Planet Graceland by Bruce.

I would best describe this series as one long journey. Mister and his crew throughout the show are hunted by virtually everyone, from the *Guild* to a certain woman and her companion who has her reasons for trying to track him down.

His journeys take him from planet to planet to spacestations to various other locations too. Mixing in some political intrigue and an alternate mission for the crew to complete on Graceland, the fun never stops.

I love the way that, although Mister and his crew are made out to be semi bad by the other characters. They're all actually really nice/likable people.

If you're looking for an anime to watch with your partner, loved one or with a group of friends, this series is perfect.",1287878400,7,1337,4.526970954356846

8404612,4,B003SPDS6W,"There are a couple of ways that I discover new anime to watch: from reading the manga, from reviews, from word-of-mouth, or from reputation. My introduction to Coyote Ragtime Show (CRS) was through a trailer, a passionately narrated 1-minute video that presented a very simple synopsis: an outlaw named Mister searches for money on a doomed planet while being hunted down by two women, both of them wanting him dead. CRS premise was interesting by itself but how the narrator described this anime at the end of the trailer really grabbed my attention because it wasn't any anime; it was the chilling, thrilling, killing, blood-spilling ride called Coyote Ragtime Show. What action lover wouldnt want to watch that?

As one mightve guessed in the previous paragraph, Mister is the main character of Coyote Ragtime Show, a cigar-chomping space pirate with an unforgettably raspy voice, a confident old man with razor-sharp wits and vivid storytelling, and the charming captain of the ship Coyote with strategies galore, tons of aliases, and a loyalty to the people he cares about. Mister is famous in the criminal underworld for wrecking havoc on various planets simply because he feels like it but, beneath the gruff exterior, Mister has a heart of gold. To me, Mister is a huge factor in making this anime into what it is.

Enveloped in Coyote Ragtime Show is a complex cast of characters. The members of Misters crew are Franca (the daughter of pirate legend Bruce with a voice (about 18 years old) older than her appearance (10-12 years) and an intriguing internal conflict about her self-worth), Katana (the light-hearted mechanic with a passion for food and a confidence that rivals Misters), my favorite character Bishop (the laid-back co-pilot thats useless at pretty much everything and always finds an opportunity for a one-liner), and Swamp (a rare African-American character in anime, a chubby, mustached preacher who had a close friendship with Bruce and constantly bickers with Bishop). The Coyote crew does a great job at maintaining CRS easygoing mood, along with the investigators chasing Mister: private eye Angelica Burns (a lover of food and a certain criminal) and her apprentice Chelsea, an illiterate young woman blessed with perfect memory (Her voice is the same one later used for May Chang in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood). Coyote Ragtime Show also has its share of villains, which include the Twelve Sisters, ruthless robotic girls named after the months of the year  for example, ones named January, the other Feburary and so on. There was one scene in episode 6 where October, November, and December are pursuing Mister in a crowded city and a building was supposedly in their way so they torpedoed the thing until it was nothing more than a collapsing mass of smoke and flames. The Twelve Sisters are led by the merciless Marciano, CRS central villain, the cold-blooded killer that murdered Francas dad and countless others with a disturbing lack of remorse. Marciano is the Frieza to Misters Goku, the perfect counterpart to CRS protagonist.

Although the opening for CRS doesnt really stand out, it still remains fairly engaging and it doesnt diminish the excellence of this shows soundtrack. Various electric guitar pieces perfectly complement the fast-paced intensity of CRS, and other instruments are thrown in there as well. A central theme, the only theme, in Coyote Ragtime Show is loyalty, sticking by your loved ones through thick and thin (Theres even an episode titled Never Change). One of my favorite things about this anime is its closing theme, an excellent, pathos-fueled claymation sequence (The closing theme plays in Coyote Ragtime Shows final fight and, for me, it pulls heartstrings).

At the conclusion of this anime, there were several crucial plot holes that were never noticed. Why did Marciano kill Francas dad? What happened to Francas mom? Why did the Federation (the righteous people ruling the galaxy) and the rebels hate each other? Regardless, Coyote Ragtime Show is more than your average action anime. Its a consistently comedic show (Episodes 5 and 9 are CRS funniest) and an attention-grabbing space-oriented drama full of emotional moments. When I first looked at this animes title, I thought it was about a coyote that loves to dance in Wild West saloons. I now realize its more than that.",1432684800,,4360,5.092307692307692
8404613,4,B003SPDS6W,a series u expect to have alot of jokes and turns out to be a other adventure action drama series it has a great flow of the story plot it gives out a good message 4 stars cause this  series would not let u down even it tried,1399161600,,225,3.6875
8404614,2,B003SPDS6W,"Coyote Ragtime tries to be the next Cowboy Bebop, which is fine, because we could all use more shows like that.  However, they fail to capture the edge and tone of Bebop and offer extremely little in the way of character development, story, and animated action.  It's starts with promise, but degrades around episode 5 and remains muddled, and uninteresting for the rest of the ride.  It's a S.A.V.E. and might work for some, so I'll try and steer the right crowd to it, and help others fly far, far away to more interesting galaxies and from this perfect example in cloned mediocrity.

***CHARACTERS***
There's a large cast of characters to explore.  They all look interesting on the surface and each feels like a candidate for depth or at least, amusement.  They become clichs quickly, depth is never explored and finding amusement becomes a chore.  The beginning revolves around a female investigator who's tracking down the main character ""Mister.""  If they would have kept the narrative with her, it would have worked, but they gave her a clueless, blinking vixen that seems placed there for fan service only.  They also decided to follow Mister and his placid crew of character clones.  There's a female criminal leader who employs a group of cyborg, death maids.  While that sounds like a cue to role your eyes, they are the most entertaining part of the show.  They try to isolate some key maids and develop some melodrama with them, but it's predictable and unnecessary.

***STORY***
""National Treasure in Space"".  Where's the space pirate loot?  A simple drive that works, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting.  I've seen other reviews of this show saying that it's fast paced.  Just because they're racing to the treasure doesn't mean the narrative favors speed.  This is slowly planned out.  The token cute girl character wonders if Mister really cares about her or the treasure, and we beat the hell out of that dead horse.  The main villainess has a sorted past and hides being ashamed of why she killed the pirate king.  Where they lovers?  Why did she kill him?  I know we'll find out eventually, but I stopped caring after 10 episodes and the answer wasn't worth the forced intrigue.

***ANIMATION***
As with a lot of anime, the first 2 episodes have promising animation and the rest is degraded.  It's not bad.  There are some worthwhile visuals in here, but most of it showcases 3 frame movements, washed-out, pastel images, poorly integrated CG, and lighting effects that where clearly added in post production to save the artists having to draw characters in different environments.  Some of the character designs are pretty solid, and some of the action fits well, but that's it.  The rest is boring studio tricks designed to simplify production, because they know that most fans don't notice.

All in all, Coyote Ragtime Show should have an age restriction on it:  AGES 17 AND BELOW.  It's colorful, quirky and cool with some action, and some murder-maid-bots.  That seems to meet the bar of youth expectation in anime, but if you're a bit older, the constant spoon feeding of storylines, flat dialogue that does nothing except reestablish what you already know, and the zero payoff in terms of action, growth, art, and execution, leave you feeling like you've done nothing but waste time.  I was less aggravated about having lost money, and more so about having lost time.",1383696000,,3398,4.87434554973822
8404615,4,B003SPDS6W,"OK, I have no idea why the Japanese name their shows with the weird names they use. The original is (  Koyte Ragutaimu Sh) which just goes to show that something wasn't lost in translation - they really named it this way.

And I really have no idea what this name has to do with the series. Guess it's just the Japanese being Japanese.

As for the show itself, it's fun as all get out.

Basically it's our hero, Mister, acting a lot like Lupin III - only competent with competent associates - racing a clock to get a treasure. We get an awesome jailbreak, cyborgs, lots of gunfire with massive collateral damage, a few crosses, double crosses and maybe even a triple cross - depends on how you look at it. Action. Lots and lots of action. You really gotta pay attention to the storyline.

Some aspects of the setup and story are just plain silly-assed, but in the context of the story they mostly work. Mostly. The characters are pretty well done, but there are too many to really get much in the way of decent character development. The English voice acting is very well done, but really, it's what we've come to expect from Funimation. I didn't listen to the Japanese, sorry, so I have no comments there.

Some of the motivations are peculiar for an American like me, but they do make sense from a Japanese viewpoint and we must always remember that Japanese anime is pretty much always made by Japanese with Japanese sensibilities and embedded in Japanese culture for consumption in Japan by other Japanese. We're just damn lucky they share with us.

This thing gets only 4-stars because there are flaws and lacks. Not many. The character development I allude to above is the most glaring flaw, but again it's a large cast with only 12 episodes to romp in. The story does hang together nicely and the ending is satisfying.

But it's still a good romp with plenty of LOL moments and well worth watching. Top 10 material? Probably not... but you will watch it again later. And later, yet again. Enjoy.",1378425600,,2002,4.541666666666667
