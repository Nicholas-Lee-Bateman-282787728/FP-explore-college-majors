7882466,3,6305070865,Need a good stretch? This one is great for improving back pain.  I'm on my feet all day long - thanks for the quick del.,1364169600,,120,3.8
7882467,5,6305070865,"I stumbled upon this toning workout video about 10 years ago and it's remained my favorite since that time. I was ecstatic when I found it on DVD a couple of years ago as I no longer had a VCR and missed doing the workout. It may not be as strenuous and calorie burning as other workouts, but it does tone your body and helps you focus. Whenever I do this workout it in the morning, I am more focused and my body is more energetic for the rest of the day. I was having problems with my feet from all the walking I do and doing this workout also helped alleviate that stress. I highly recommend it as a part of your workout regimen!",1212192000,,631,4.056
7882468,5,6305070865,"This video is amazing.  I have to admit, the first time I watched it, I thought the instructor was a little ""out there"".  She is very spiritual and confident and uses a lot of reference to water, fire and air.  There is a focus on deep breating, balance and large movements to get the blood circulation going.  After I got rid of my judgment and fear, I noticed that I felt GREAT once I was 1/2 way through the workout.  At the end of the workout, I felt awesome.  I have even come to love her instructions such as ""push your arms up into the air to make way for your dreams. Push up the clouds.""  If you want a workout and a meditation combined into one, this is it.",1146787200,2,667,4.084615384615384
7882469,5,6305070865,"I have been doing Tae Bo for a while, and I bought Tantric Toning for weekend stretching and toning. Boy, was I surprised! It really worked me. I could feel the fire in my body! I know when I finished, Stephanie -gave- me a workout! And the best part is? It wasn't hard! Her voice is also very soothing, and what I liked best was the designated woman who did stuff the ""easy way"" for us beginners. That way, you don't feel compelled to do what Stephanie is doing. You can watch Bobbie and see what she's doing and follow her.
This is the best workout next to Tae Bo!",1081641600,4,566,4.154545454545454
7882470,4,6305070865,"I found Tantric Toning to be an interesting blend of workout styles, namely low-impact aerobics, yoga, and Tai Chi.  It reminded me a bit of Petra Kobler's BREATHE, but unlike that video, you don't have to repeatedly ""take it from the top,"" which I find to be boring.  Instead, this workout includes a very wide variety of different movements, flowing from one to the next.  The workout begins with an 8-minute warm-up focused on ""being present.""  This section consists mainly of simple standing pose such as horse, a basic pose in which your feet are spread and your knees soft.  There are also plies, hip movements, and ankle circles to warm up the lower half of your body.
The main body of the workout consists of four sections which flow seamlessly from one to the next.  The first, Earth (8 minutes), continues the standing poses for slightly more intense stretches, such as triangle pose.  The Air section (8 minutes) is similar and adds some balance moves such as leg lifts.  The third section, Fire (10 minutes), is both the longest and the most fast-moving.  This segment provides low-impact aerobics:  you'll do poses such as bow and arrow (similiar to warrior pose), but you'll move through them very quickly.  The arms are thoroughly worked in this section, as most of the poses require them to be held up at shoulder level or higher.  Finally, the workout ends with Water, a 7-minute cool down.  The poses here are more recognizable from traditional hatha yoga, including standing forward bend and variations on tree pose (called waterfall and water droplet here).
The total workout is about 41 minutes in length, but the video ends with a 15-minute meditation called ""Color Meditation.""  This is a seated meditation (either in a simple cross-legged position or hero's pose) focused on color:  as a lens filter fills the screen with color, instructor Stephanie talks about the positive and negative emotions associated with that color, going through red, green, yellow, blue, and ending with white.  I usually don't enjoy meditation, but I was pleasantly surprised that the 15 minutes passed very quickly.  Overall, this workout is definitely ""stress free"" as it promises.  Although the toning benefits are probably limited, you will definitely raise your heart rate, particularly during the Fire section.  This is a nice program to use on weekend or other light days, and it can be performed with or without the color meditation at the end.",1077494400,10,2454,4.9559902200489
7882471,5,6305070865,"I have looked for an exercise tape that would allow me to feel good about myself when I finished it, and this one is IT. This tape offers just enough challenge to keep it from being boring, but neither do you feel like a failure because you couldn't finish the routine.
 Stephanie does a great job of leading you thru the different phases of the tape, and her constant encouragement and vocal pictures make the routines a pleasure, instead of a chore.",1015804800,6,451,4.5
7882472,5,6305070865,"I've enjoyed using this exercise video more than any I've ever used before...and that is a lot.  Stephanie's voice is so soothing and her instruction so clear, along with the well orchestrated background music, that you actually get lost in excercise, believe it or not!!  You also get a fabulous, fun, and complete workout that is very uplifting.  I highly recommend this. I've looked for more info about Stephanie, but haven't found anything.  I'd love to know more about her and hopes she has a follow up video and/or book.  Anyone with info, please contact me:  Sstar48@aol.com",969926400,3,581,4.938144329896907
7882473,5,6305070865,I have exercised with this tape everyday since it arrived. The energy and positive mental state I recieve from practicing the simple flowing and graceful movements is wonderful. I would like to inquire if Stephanie has  any other tapes on the market. Please contact me if she does.,961804800,,281,4.854166666666667
7882474,5,6305070865,"I started this workout because I am Type II Diabetic and insulin dependent.  Every evening I've had to take 35 units of long acting insulin as well as between 5 and 10 units of regular insulin.  I did the workout,  from start to finish and my blood sugars went from 208 to 88!  I didn't use  any insulin that night, nor did I need any the next morning!  I LOVE THIS  TAPE!  For any diabetics out there who have difficulty exercising, this  video is for you!  Enjoy it!  I still have to take insulin occasionally,  but I Love what it does for me!  I know that you'll love what it does for  you!
I did not care for the inaccurate visulization meditation at the end  of the tape, but again, I can't say enough GOOD about the exercise tape  itself!  Enjoy!",959558400,2,752,4.219858156028369
7882475,5,6305070865,"Absolutely love this workout video.  Great for a beginner.  Keeps you interested and wanting to do the program everyday.  This video talks to you on your level.  The ending meditation ""colors"" is very relaxing.",946339200,4,210,5.088235294117647
