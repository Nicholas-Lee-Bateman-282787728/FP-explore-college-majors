The Yoga Today documentary offers a comprehensive look at the world of yoga.  It is a large topic, going far beyond just the physical benefits of the practice.  This video shows some of the great masters in their element, some who are no longer with us.  It has lovely scenery and very interesting shots of people practicing yoga and meditative movement.",1220400000,,422,4.901408450704225
