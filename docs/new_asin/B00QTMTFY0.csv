8692937,5,B00QTMTFY0,"This product has 3 individual discs for each movie. I love that about this. Already tried each and they operate perfect. It was on someone elses dvd player so it didn't appear to have subtitles, but I will update later if I find out that on PC it does have subs. People who I watch these movies with don't particularly like the movies, but since I am a quiet reserved guy personally. I like these movies for the quiet reserved main character. A Place Beyond the Pines is pretty much 4 stories in one which gets a lot of criticism. Personally I think it's well done and non-pandering. That is probably why it is so poorly reviewed by others. Only God forgives is a very visual movie with little dialog. It's a bit extreme and odd. It's worth a watch. Drive is the most typical in story telling fashions. It follows a clear direction with clear character motives. The characters have quite a few silent moments I've seen others describe as ""hipster"" but it's just how some people are and interact. It's a very genuine feeling movie. Rushed dialog movies lose some of the characters thoughts and feeling imo.",1496534400,2,1105,4.557788944723618
