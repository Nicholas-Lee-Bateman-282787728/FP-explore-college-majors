5062638,5,B0077PTWNM,"The preview video is more entertaining then anything seen today. The clash was so cool, free ppv and never a flop. I really, REALLY, miss this era in wrestling.",1334880000,,160,4.551724137931035
5062639,4,B0077PTWNM,The fact that WWE didn't massacre this collection is a miracle. The only gripes I have is that it's missing the Lex Luger and Rick Steiner match. That has to be the best match either of those guys ever wrestled. It would've been cool to have on DVD. Speaking of DVD that brings be to my other problem with this set. Why WWE feels the need to reward blu ray player owners with exclusive matches is beyond me. Sure the blu ray version generally costs a few more dollars but they could still put those matches on DVD by leaving off crap like madusa/bull nakano or previously released matches like Austin/Pillman. Or maybe just add another disc. We all know how cheap discs are. I own a blu ray player but do not purchase WWE releases in that format simply to protest this BS practice of theirs. Overall it looks to be a pretty good set well worth the money I will be spending to buy the DVD version.,1334620800,,896,4.3076923076923075
5062640,4,B0077PTWNM,"...but I do wish the Midnight Express vs. Flair and Windham match from Clash of the Champions IV was on the regular DVD release.  Also, the MX vs. the Fantastics from the first Clash would have been great too.",1334275200,2,209,4.358974358974359
5062641,3,B0077PTWNM,"I really appreciate that WWE is releasing some classic WCW footage.  But how about some complete events, rather than only releasing these ""best of"" sets?

I cannot be the only person who would love to spend some cash on complete WCW ""anthology"" style sets, similar to the Wrestlemania, Royal Rumble and Summerslam sets.  Starrcade Anthology?  Clash of the Champions Anthology?  Halloween Havoc Anthology?  Or how about yearly PPV anthology packages with highlights from the weekly television shows?  WCW 1996, 1997 or 1998 when the WCW/nWo storyline was at it's best.  Throw all of the WCW pay-per-view events from 1997 in one boxed set.  How about something like that?

They should really do the same with ECW, also.

And what about taking care of their own history?  I'm still waiting to complete the Survivor Series Anthology.  Releasing the first two volumes was great, but what about the ""Attitude Era""?  You know fans would love to have the complete 1997 event and beyond.

And a complete Saturday Night's Main Event set would be pretty incredible...",1333756800,3,1056,5.023121387283237
5062642,3,B0077PTWNM,The blu ray extras should be on the regular dvd! Clash of champions 17 match with ricky steamboat and dustin rhodes vs.arn anderson and larry zybsko should be on this.this was one of the best matches of the clash series.,1333324800,2,220,4.525
5062643,3,B0077PTWNM,"I haven't watched it yet, but i have looked at the posted contents of the release. I can definitely say that I am a little disappointed at some left out yet underrated classics. Junkyard Dog vs. Ric Flair for the world title in 1990, Lex Luger vs. Rick Steiner for the world title, Scott Steiner vs. Ric Flair for the title, and Bobby Eaton vs. Flair in a 2/3 falls match were all classics that we may never have seen on PPV's but got the rare chance to see some of these guys get a main event match for the title. I hope they release some more volumes, but I'm not holding my breath.",1331251200,2,584,4.131578947368421

5062661,5,B0077PTWNM,"I grew up on Clash of the Champions. The first one converted me from a WWF guy to a full blown WCW fan until the Russo era hit. Some of the matches are short (Medusa Nakano, and I have no idea what a six man tag would go 5 minutes or so), but the classics, like Flair Sting from I, Steamboat Austin, and even some forgotten ones like Lex vs. Flair make this a wide array of matches with a host of stars.",1437868800,,403,3.8674698795180724

5062664,2,B0077PTWNM,"This wasn't a bad DVD set, could've been a lot better, match selection wise, and they could have made a document for this. I love the documentaries on many of these sets.

Seriously, Mil Mascara vs Cactus Jack?! What about The Dragon Master, Buzz Sawyer, and Great Muta vs Ole and Arn Anderson and Ric Flair that was on the same card?! We all know McMahon doesn't put the greatest emphasis on things he doesn't create, but c'mon now! And that 15 man battle royal on disc 2 was weak, and so was the talent in WCW at that point. And how do you have a best of Clash and NOT show any Road Warriors matches or clips? I'm giving this 2 Stars, because this was a rush job thrown together",1425772800,2,680,4.190839694656488

5062671,4,B0077PTWNM,"Before the era of ""WCW Monday Nitro"", there was one event available on cable television where you had the matches after match featuring the superstars of the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling against each other. WWE has ""Saturday Night's Main Event"" while NWA/WCW had theirs in ""The Clash Of The Champions."" Dusty Rhodes host this DVD set while it should also be noted that Jesse Ventura's commentary has been removed from the matches he was involved in.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - It should be noted that Horsemen manager J.J. Dillion was suspended in a cage to prevent interference in this match while there were also 3 judges at ringside (Penthouse model Patty Mullen & NWA executives Sandy Scott & Gary Juster) to make a ruling incase the match went to a draw.  Both men were feeling each other early before Sting was able to get control staying one step ahead of Flair & constantly going back to a specific series of basic holds while also showcasing his strength with offense focusing on a specific area of the body while Flair also worked over different areas of the body with his trademark offense including chops so hard that you saw a cut on Sting's chest as they continued to trade momentum throughout this match with Flair living up to his nickname of being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" taking a shortcut whenever possible while Sting fought back including using some of Flair's own offense against him resulting in a match that made Sting a household name overnight in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today.
Mar. '88
[Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection]

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - The team also known as the ""Twin Towers"" dominated the first half of this match to the point where Luger he got the Torture Rack on Tully in the first minute & Barry had a sleeperhold so tight on Tully that he was able to keep it on when they both rolled out of the ring. The Horsemen later caught up & did what they did best in tag team wrestling by cutting the ring in half & making their quick tags having this match go back & forth between both teams with the crowd hot the entire time. James J. Dillion got involved in the end as this match didn't go long but it was non-stop action from start to finish.
Mar. '88
[Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen; Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upperhand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.
June '88
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

Russian Chain Match: Ricky Morton vs. Ivan Koloff - This chain match was held under the rules that you had to touch all four corners to win. Both men used the chain as a weapon throughout the match from choking, using it to give a low blow, and whip each other while also telling the story of Morton being lighter in weight, he had more trouble pulling Koloff. The quality is what you usually expect in this type of match but the biggest story came afterwords due to Paul Jones making it clear that this was ""make it or break it"" for the weak link in Koloff.
Sept. '88

""I Quit"" Match: Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - Despite Flair being the World Champion, this was a non-title match has it evolved past the championship into a fight about pride to the point where both men agreed that the loser would shake the winners hand. Flair was very physical here with his chops from the start to the point where Funk was knocked down & outside numerous times. Funk retaliated by brawling using his taped fist & even the microphone & even trying to choke Flair into giving up. Both men fought on the outside with Funk going for a ""slip & slide"" on the ringside table right into a chair before Flair began to work over & punish Funk's leg. Ric Flair has his more ""unique"" series of matches in his career against Terry Funk & this match is no exception as Flair wrestled a more aggressive offensive style here while Funk was his usual self in being a hardcore brawl while able to do little things to make some comedic moments.
Nov. '89
[Ultimate Ric Flair Collection; Legends Of Wrestling: Roddy Piper & Terry Funk]

Mil Mascaras vs. Cactus Jack Manson - In a nutshell, this was just Cactus being a body for Mascaras to showcase himself with his various submissions & high flying while Cactus at one took a hard hit falling off the apron with his head smacking the concrete floor.
Feb. '90

NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. Rock N' Roll Express - One of the greatest rivalries in tag team history continued here with the R&R Express being able to keep staying one step ahead causing the Midnight Express to resort to dirty tactics to gain the advantage while continuing to slow down the pace & double team to keep it before the momentum would trade back & forth between both teams. This wasn't their best encounter but definitely a quality match.
June '90

NWA United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Ric Flair - While Luger & Flair have had countless encounters throughout their career for the World Championship, this was a different match than all of them as Luger was the champion while Flair was the challenger as he wanted to win the title to become the #1 contender to WCW Champion Sting. Luger showed his power advantage early on with constant full body press slams on Flair before Flair cheated to get the advantage & worked over Luger's back to take away his power by throwing him into the guardrail numerous times while Flair also targeted Luger's leg using the ringpost as well before Luger got a heavy adrenaline rush & continued to use his power against Flair including a middle rope superplex. This is definitely a ""lost"" match in their long term series of matches in NWA/WCW but wasn't up there with the quality of their World Title matches.
Sept. '90

The Young Pistols & Z-Man vs. The Fabulous Freebirds - The Freebirds were doing the ""rock band"" gimmick at this time with their manager being ""Diamond"" Dallas Page, road manager being Big Daddy Dink (Sir Oliver Humperdink), and the recently added masked third member in Badstreet. This match was too quick to really make anything of note past it showcasing the speed of the Pistols & Z-Man.
June '91

15-Man Battle Royal - This was just an average battle royal that really didn't have any standout moments past serving it's purpose in trying to establish El Gigante as the next Andre The Giant however it was interesting to see various wrestlers before the more famous runs in the business like Dustin ""Goldust"" Rhodes (""The Natural""), Kevin Nash (Oz), and Steve Austin (""Stunning"").
Sept. '91

WCW United States Champion Sting vs. Rick Rude - Rick Rude came to WCW a month earlier at Halloween Havoc alongside Paul E. Dangerously & Madusa declaring his intentions of gaining the United States Championship while also during this time, Sting was receiving various gifts while also having a bounty put on out him from a mystery person who was revealed earlier in the night to be Lex Luger who attacked Sting's previously injured leg to the point where he was in the hospital only to return for this match with his leg wrapped up. Sting was fighting on adrenaline as they fought on the ramp with Sting slamming Rude on it before doing a hit & move strategy while hopping on one leg as Rude did focus on the knee with clips & using the ringpost while Dangerously got involved as well but Sting just couldn't overcome the odds against him due to the earlier attack. This was more to just get the title off him as he would focus on the Luger & the World Championship after this match but this would also be the first match in the classic feud between Sting & Rude in WCW. I would have preferred their 30 minute ""King Of Cable"" tournament encounter at the Clash a year later but this was more important in terms of a significance.
Nov. '91

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: WCW/NWA Tag Team Champions Hollywood Blondes vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Despite Ric Flair returning to WCW months earlier at the SuperBrawl III PPV, this was actually his in-ring return. Austin & Pillman kept mocking Flair & Anderson in regards to their age at times only for both men to respond with their trademark fist & chops as Flair looked like he hadn't lost a step causing the Blondes to work over Anderson's knee with moves like the half crab. Both teams traded momentum back & forth throughout the match as ""old timers"" in the Horsemen kept up with the younger Blondes & even had them beat at various times throughout the match.
June '93
[Stone Cold Truth]

Brian Pillman vs. Steve Austin - Only a short time after the previous match would Pillman injure his ankle while the Blondes would not only lose the tag titles but also break up as a team when Austin chose Col. Parker as his manager over Pillman as his partner. Pillman jumped Austin in the ring before the bell & brought the fight to Austin including a hard chop that knocked him down before Austin was able to gain some offense working over the ankle with moves like the half crab. Both men went back & forth from here before Col. Parker would once again be the factor in the issue between both men here. The match wasn't long but really came off as a high intense grudge match.
Nov. '93
[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

WCW Television Champion Steven Regal vs. Dustin Rhodes - Before the days of William Regal & Goldust, they met here in a match with a 15 minute time limit that was a real technical match from start to finish with both men grounding each other while working the same pace throughout the match before Dustin realized that time was running out & picked up the pace while Regal tried to use the rules to his advantage as the champion. Back in the days of the WCW Television Championship during the mid-90's, this was the belt that established Steven (William) Regal in WCW & this showcased why as he wasn't just a get technical wrestler but a smart one as well.
Jan. '94

Elimination Match: Sting & Ric Flair vs. Rick Rude & Vader - It should be noted that along with Tony Schavone, Bobby Heenan (announcer) & Nick Bockwinkle (Commissioner) were on commentary as both men made their WCW debuts that night. Vader came into this match with one thing in mind after losing the WCW Title to Flair at Starrcade the previous month & that's hurting Flair which he did the moment he was able to by targeting Flair's back with various splashes, Vader Bomb, and 2 superplexes before the WCW Commissioner had to step in as Vader as about to cross the line. Sting & Rude delivered the performance that we would expect to reignite their long term feud but this was all about the story between Flair & Vader.
Jan. '94

Unification Match: WCW International Champion Sting vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - For those who don't know the story behind the WCW International Championship, WCW not only had their World Championship but were also having the then-NWA Championship defended on their events as well (think of the WCW title on WWE TV back in 2001). However when WCW & NWA were no longer working together, WCW kept the title & renamed it the WCW International Championship causing two world championships in the company (think of the WWE Title & World Heavyweight Title in current WWE) leading to this match to unify the titles. It should also be noted that Sherri Martel revealed that she would be in Sting's corner as her manager before the match while Hulk Hogan made his official WCW debut earlier in the night. Flair showed from the very start that he wasn't completely focused on the match as he was easily distracted from the fans to the cameraman allowing Sting to take advantage & dominate early causing Flair to constantly go to the outside to the point where he got real close to being counted out & disqualified at some points in the match. Sting was able to keep countering & no selling Flair's offense before Flair was able to capitalize on Sting missing a move before Flair tried dirty tactics like having his feet on the ropes & throwing Sting over the top rope when the referee wasn't looking. Both men went back & forth from here with Sting getting the upper hand before Flair resorted to shoving Sherri in the way of danger to get an advantage. While this doesn't measure up to their previous & future classic matches, this was definitely another chapter in their long time feud along with it being a rare gem due to the unification stipulation.
June '94
[Ultimate Ric Flair Collection]

WCW United States Champion Steve Austin vs. Ricky Steamboat - This match had a special stipulation in that Austin could lose the championship on a disqualification. Steamboat's offense consisted of grounding Austin with headlocks & armbars & chops including delivering one that knocked down Austin to the ground before working over his arm including using the ring post. Both men would continue to trade chops while Austin would continue to mock Steamboat by slapping him around & shoving his face into the ground including one moment when Steamboat went for a superplex only for Austin to knock him off & have Steamboat land on his tailbone. Austin has said that Steamboat was his favorite guy to be in the ring with & you'll see why here as they gave a performance in a series of matches that would be overshadowed by the Hogan/Flair feud in WCW like how it did during this match itself. This match would later hold more importance as it would turn out to be Steamboat's last match for up to 15 years as he retired the next month.
Aug. '94
[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair & The Giant - It should be noted that Savage defeated Flair to regain the WCW Championship the night before on Nitro while NFL Star Kevin Greene was in Hogan & Savage's corner along with Ms. Elizabeth who was making her WCW debut. Flair kept mocking Greene early before he got in the ring with Flair backing off. Savage was in control early to the point where Flair was knocked over the turnbuckle into a cameraman & hitting Hogan's big boot on the apron before falling to the floor. Giant regained the momentum & dominated with his size & power before Hogan started to make a comeback resorting to double teaming & dirty tactics to keep the advantage. This was a good match with everyone involved & did it's job in continuing the feuds going into the next PPV.

Madusa vs. Bull Nakano - This was a rematch from the Hog Wild PPV earlier in the week as Bull started out with hair drags that would spin Madusa in circles & even used nun-chucks behind the referees back causing Madusa to comeback with shoulder takedowns & even taking a shot on Sonny Onoo on the outside. This wasn't the quality that we got from their WWE days two years earlier but for the limited times that WCW actually had a women wrestling, this was one of the best matches in they've had in that ""division.""
Aug. '96

Eddie Guerrero vs. Dallas Page - It was during this time that Dallas Page was defending a championship called ""Lord Of The Ring"" which was the ring that he won by winning the BattleBowl battle royal back at Slamboree. Eddie was in control with his fast paced offense but crashed & burned when he hit the ringpost shoulder first allowing DDP to focus on the midsection with moves like the gutbuster. Eddie regained the advantage before DDP hit a jawbreaker & impactful powerbomb before Page left an opening for Eddie to take advantage off before DDP showed afterwords (3 times...3 times...3 times) that he wasn't taking what happened lightly.

WCW World Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat vs. Steiner Brothers vs. Sting & Lex Luger - This was a triangle match where the first time score a pinfall/submission would become the Tag Team Champions regardless of which team was pinned. This had some moments where all 3 teams were involved in the action like Booker being crotched on the ropes by Steiner before Luger clotheslined him off the ropes to the floor, Rick Steiner making the blind tag on Luger & coming in clotheslining members of both teams, and Luger breaking up his pin on Booker right afterwords. This told a good story of each team wanting to get into the action to become the champions with the blind tags & it being every team for themselves but it would be the issues with the controversial calls of Nick Patrick & The Outsiders who played the wild cards in this match.
Aug. '96

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Ultimate Dragon vs. Dean Malenko - This was Malenko's last title shot after losing the Crusierweight Title to Dragon at Starrcade & the previous night on Nitro as Dragon started out with fast & stiff kicks including one that was so loud that Malenko had to go to the outside to recover. Malenko came back with a back suplex that dropped Dragon right on his head & focused on the leg with twist & stretches, stomps including on the guardrail, half crab, and figure four. The action really picked up towards the end with Malenko delivering a superplex, Dragon countering a powerbomb with the schoolboy pin attempt before the asisa moonsault on the outside & later a frankensteiner off the top rope, and Malenko with a powerbomb into the Texas Cloverleaf. This was the exact type of action you would expect from the crusierweight decision.
Jan. '97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero - Eddie came into the match very cocky early & tried to show off only for Jericho to respond taking Eddie off guard having him hide behind the referee & falsely accuse Jericho of pulling his hair while Jericho just looked on saying ""Your better than that Eddie."" From here, the match was very fast paced with non-stop action from both men including a frankensteiner from the top rope by Eddie, Jericho attempting a springboard crossbody from inside the ring to the floor, Eddie superplexed from the apron to the floor, and Jericho delivering a release german suplex. Both men were counter for counter here until in the end, it was all about who was able to get caught that determined the winner. This was more of a preview to their more famous match at the Fall Brawl PPV the next month.
Aug. '97

WCW Tag Team Champions Scott Hall & Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger & Dallas Page - This would turn out to the final main event on the final Clash Of The Champions event as the nWo were celebrating their birthday on this show with Kevin Nash allowing Savage to defend his half of the tag titles in this match. Nash & Elizabeth remained at ringside before Nash eventually got involved being sent to the back as both teams exchanged momentum before the nWo singled out DDP & worked him over building to the hot tag to Luger but it was a miscommunication between Luger & Page that would work towards the nWo's advantage but it was said...or not said...by Sting that left the final impression.
Aug. '97

(Blu-Ray) Ric Flair & Barry Windham vs. Midnight Express - This was a unique match for this time as Flair & Windham were not only the top two singles wrestlers in the company (holding the World & U.S. titles) but also the final two members of the Horsemen against not only one of the top tag teams in the company but also the team who took the tag team titles from the other two Horsemen members in Anderson & Blanchard right before they left for WWE. Flair tried to intimidate Eaton early who his ""Whoo!"" before Eaton responded by popping him in the mouth & knocking Flair down with both members of the Express eventually showing off against Flair as they had control with their counters to the double team attempts by the Horsemen. Flair & Windham did whatever they could to get the advantage & keep it from double teaming moves to their manager J.J. Dillion getting involved leading to a fight between him & Cornette. Good quality tag team match.
Dec. '88

(Blu-Ray) Sting & Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude & Steve Austin - This was a rare match in that the top 4 contenders for the WCW Championship were all in one match as members of the Dangerous Alliance were going against two of their top targets in Sting & Steamboat. This a fun main event to say the least as Sting & Steamboat clearly had the strategy of ""beat them at their own game"" as they openly broke the rules various times such as not tagging in & out of the match only to switch behind the referees back, using moves like a back rake, Sting giving the atomic drop on both sides of Rick Rude, and both men covering one member of the other team. Again, a fun main event at this Clash with (for those trivia fans) being one of the first encounters between Steamboat & Austin in a feud that would be revisited in singles & tag team divisions for over the next 3 years in WCW.
Jan. '92

(Blu-Ray) ThunderCage Match: Dustin Rhodes & Sting vs. Big Van Vader, Paul Orndorff, Barry Windham - For those who have never seen a ThunderCage match before, it's WCW's version of ""Hell In A Cell"" where it's a giant steel cage that surrounds not only the ring but the ringside area as well with the top of the cage bent inwards so nobody can escape. This match was originally scheduled to be an eight man tag but due to various injuries & angles throughout the night, we ended up getting a tag team handicap match. While the cage looked impressive, the match itself fell below expectations as they never left first gear to the point where the match was dull until another man made an appearance who had his recent issues with Vader to even out the odds & eventually kick off what would be one of the most physically violent feuds in WCW history with Vader.
Jan. '93

(Walmart Bonus) NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. The Fantastics - You knew exactly where this match was going from the opening minute as both teams started brawling to the floor the minute they were in the ring with chairs coming into play right away before a table was used along with more chairs including Jim Cornette on the outside throwing them. Midnight Express kept control in the ring with their double team moves including one point where Cornette held up the table on the outside so Rogers' head could be ran right into it before Eaton pulled out some power moves of his own like the powerslam. They continued to work over Tommy Rogers keeping him away from Robert Fulton before taking the action back to the outside where Rogers was no only slammed on but also bulldog onto the flat table. Rogers was eventually able to make the tag to Fulton but the referee couldn't see it & also couldn't see the Express double teaming with Cornette getting involved again causing him to not take it anymore & all hell breaking loose with referees getting thrown over the top rope, Cornette attacking everyone in sight with his tennis racket, and a people getting whipped with a leather belt. This was a very aggressive match for it's time from start to finish.
Mar. '88

(Walmart Bonus) WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Ric Flair - A couple of side notes here in that Hogan joined the nWo only two months earlier before winning the WCW Championship & spray painting it earlier in the week at the Hog Wild PPV while Flair was out for revenge for the nWo attack on Arn Anderson backstage weeks earlier on Nitro while Tony Schavone mentioned on commentary that these two had also met in a WCW Championship match two years earlier the same month at another Clash event. Both men tried to show each other up early with Hogan mocking Flair's strut & ""WHOO!"" while Flair got his slaps in on Hogan as well before Hogan was able to take Flair down & get a hammerlock on but Flair responded with his trademark chops that sent Hogan down to the floor. Hogan came back & used his power which included whipping Flair hard into the corner to the point where he flipped over to the floor where Hogan threw Flair into the post. Flair resort to being ""The Dirtiest Player In The Game"" in order to regain his advantage but Hogan ""Hulked Up"" but ended up missing the legdrop allowing Flair to get the figure four before The Outsiders came out to save Hogan. This wasn't anywhere near their previous encounters as far as quality goes but did it's job in furthering the feud between WCW & the New World Order.
Aug. '96

As usual with these DVD sets, they can't include each match that was either high on quality in-ring action or name value but at least some of these selections were released on recent DVD sets (like the Enforcers vs. Steamboat & Rhodes tag match) so I can't really complain there. I just know that four matches I would have loved to see on here is the Van Hammer vs. Cactus Jack Falls Count Anywhere match as that was just absolutely nuts, the Steiners vs. Williams & Gordy tag match, Steamboat & Douglas vs. Windham & Rhodes, and the Sting vs. Rude King Of Cable semi-final encounter but you can't win them all. In the end, this was a nice trip down memory lane & can only hope for a volume two but for now, I recommend.",1403568000,,25342,4.539943094769096
5062672,3,B0077PTWNM,"I'm in a good position to review this DVD because I've watched all 35 Clash of Champions events on the WWE network in addition to owning this DVD and I can say that whoever compiled the matches must have just thrown darts at a list of cards for this great series. Some of the choices make sense the like the first two matches on the DVD (Flair vs. Sting & Anderson/Blanchard vs. Luger/Windham) and the classic ""I Quit"" match between Flair and Terry Funk. However, there are some puzzling exclusions - the most glaring being Flair vs. Steamboat at Clash of Champions VI, which is the greatest CoC match ever and arguably the greatest wrestling match ever, period. Other exclusions include the epic tag team match between The Fantastics and The Sheepherders (aka The Bushwhackers) and The Four Horsemen attacking Lex Luger in the parking lot at Clash II. In addition to the questionable exceptions there are some matches that simply aren't very good, like the gimmick chain match between Ivan Koloff and Ricky Morton at Clash 3 and the lame women's match between Madusa (misspelled as ""Medusa"" on the package) and Bull Nakano.

The commentary by Dusty Rhodes provides some context in the beginning when he briefly talks about the reason why the event was started in the first place but after that his commentary is brief and unnecessary. They could have done a much better job of discussing the historic importance of the event.

All in all this DVD really isn't worth it if you have access to the WWE network because you can watch all 35 shows, and many of the best matches from Clash of the Champions do not appear on the DVDs.",1402272000,,1627,4.665505226480836

THE VERY BEST OF
WCW CLASH OF THE CHAMPIONS

Ah yes the classic event that had many a fan hooked from NWA/WCW, the Clash of the Champions. This event was originally started to go against the WWFs Wrestlemania. It would see many classic matches and moments over the years. That is why I would have loved for this to have had a documentary included like the Starrcade set. Or maybe also include moments like the Nitro sets. Still it is a great set full of classic matches.

Spoilers

DISC. 1

1.[NWA TITLE]RIC FLAIR VS STING-from the very first Clash we get we get the first main event, and what a main event it was. This is a classic with two legends from the sport. This is also the night widely regarded as the night Sting was made. They tell an excellent story here that lasts the TV time limit of 45 minutes. The judges ended up scoring this as a draw so Flair retained in an instant classic.

2.[NWA TAG TITLE]ARN ANDERSON & TULLY BLANCHARD VS LEX LUGER AND BARRY WINDHAM-this match happened at the first one as well before the previous match on this set. This is another classic in my opinion as this one is nonstop action. All four men look great with some excellent back and forth action. JJ of course has to get involved but it back fires costing his team the win and the belts.

3.[NWA TAG TITLE]ARN ANDERSON & TULLY BLANCHARD VS STING & DUSTY RHODES-this match happened at the second Clash and was one of those classic NWA feuds of the Horsemen. This was an excellent match and one that every fan should see. These two teams of rivals gave the fans a classic as the action was back and forth and everywhere. It turns into a brawl towards the end with Flair and Windham coming out causing the match to be a double DQ after Dusty nailed the ref.

4.[RUSSIAN CHAIN MATCH]RICKY MORTON VS IVAN KOLOFF-this chain match was at the third Clash and was a good one as they went to touch all four corners. This match would see both men using the chain of course beating, choking, and pulling the other off the top ropes. It was a good fight between the men until Morton was able to finally win the match. This lead to Ivans manager Paul Jones and his teammates the Russian Assassins to attack their former stable mate.

5.[NWA TITLE I QUIT MATCH]RIC FLAIR VS TERRY FUNK-another classic form the early Clash days as this one was on the ninth. These two battle all over the ring and the outside with both very physical here. This is terrys type of match but Flair held his own throughout very much so. The stipulation here was that whoever quit would have to shake the others hand. So both held out taking it to the other until Flair clamped the figure four on and finally forced Funk to quit. True to his word Terry shuck his hand and then both men were attacked by Gary Hart, The Great Muta, and Lex Luger. This brought Sting out to lend a hand to Flair and Funk.

6. MIL MASCARAS VS CACTUS JACK MANSON-this match was all Mil as he took it to Cactus with various submissions and aerial attacks. This match which took place at the tenth Clash here in Texas would see Cactus take one of the nastiest bumps I have seen him take. He lands on the concrete with his head smashing into it. Moments later he is pinned by a flying cross body or flying body press depending who you ask.

7.[NWA TAG TITLE]THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS VS THE ROCK N ROLL EXPRESS-one of the most famous and greatest rivalries in wrestling history without a doubt. Here at the eleventh Clash these two teams went at it with the NWA United States Tag Team titles on the line. This was a fun match as both teams gave the fans what they wanted with a back and forth contest. In the end the R&R Express got the DQ win.

8.[US TITLE]RIC FLAIR VS LEX LUGER-at the twelfth Clash this was another classic NWA/WCW feud as Flair always brought out the best in Luger. Luger is an underrated wrestler and is much better than people give him credit for. This a great match between the two with Luger using his power to slow Flair down. Flair used his usual tactics but Luger continued his dominance at various points causing Stan Hansen to interfere. This causes Flair to get disqualified.

9. THE YOUNG PISTOLS & Z-MAN VS THE FABULOUS FREEBIRDS-this was a good and quick match from the 15th Clash. Good back and forth for a while until we get a great ending with a triple sunset flip pin for the Pistols and Z-Man. It should be noted that this was during the time that Brad Armstrong was a member of the Freebirds as Badstreet.

10.15 MAN BATTLE ROYAL-who dosent love a battle royal, it is without a doubt one of my favorite matches. This match opened up the sixteenth Clash and was a fun battle royal with people flying everywhere. You get to see some future legends before they really took off in this match. Still this was a match to put El Gigante over.

11.[US TITLE]STING VS RICK RUDE-this was a great match form the 17th Clash that would see one of my favorite camera shots of all time. When they first start brawling on the ramp that shot from behind Sting just looks and feels so epic. Anyway Sting has been attacked earlier in the night and had to rush back to the building in order to defend his title. This match told a great story here as Sting was showing what he is all about, heart. Naturally Rude along with Paul E. Dangerously would work over the leg from start to finish. Sting battled back at every turn but Rude was too much for a one legged Stinger and took the title after gripping the tights.

12. RIC FLAIR & ARN ANDERSON VS THE HOLLYWOOD BLONDS-Clash 23 saw two of the Horsemen trying to capture the tag titles away from the younger team. Austin and Pillman made fun of their older opponents only for it to back fire most of the time. Both teams looked great here taking turns beating on the other team. Each team had moments of working over one of their opponents and singling him out. Flair and Arn get the first fall after a nice flying elbow from Ric while Arn holds Steve. We get a little bit of a slower pace in the second round as they work over Flair on the outside before bringing him back in. Arn turns things around at first after getting in off of the hot tag but he is soon slowed down. But once Ric gets in he lights the young ones up, that is until Barry Windham interferes causing a DQ. That means Flair and Anderson could not get the titles.

13. BRIAN PILLMAN VS STEVE AUSTIN-we get another great match right here as the former tag partners go at it at Clash 25. This is a great match with Austin controlling most of the time dominating Pillman in the ring and even on the outside after catching Brian trying for a high risk maneuver. Pillman fights back and makes a few comebacks from time to time but it is the ending that is great. When Brian jumps onto the ropes Col. Parker knocks him off and allows Austin to pin him. What was so great about it is seeing the guy in the crowd a few rows back in the hat who is just so upset by it.

14.[TV TITLE]STEVEN REGAL VS DUSTIN RHODES-this was a great technical matchup from Clash 26 with both guys showcasing their skills. They worked over each other with various holds trying to wear the other down. The pace picks up as the match goes on since it had a time limit of 15 minutes. They battle it out over the full course of time going to a draw. This was a really good match.

15.[ELIMINATION TAG MATCH]STING & RIC FLAIR VS VADER  & RICK RUDE-the main event from the same Clash as the previous this elimination match was a fun one. This one was all about Vader wanting to put Flair out permanently. It takes a while for Flair to get in but once he does Vader just goes to town on him. Once all four men start brawling Vader and Flair end up getting counted out and therefore eliminated. We then get the classic feud of Sting versus Rick Rude. They give us a great match with Sting getting the win after a big splash from the top rope.

DISC 2

1.[UNIFICATION MATCH FOR WCW INTERNATIONAL AND WCW CHAMPIONSHIPS]RIC FLAIR VS STING-this match was to unify the two titles that WCW had at the time. There was the WCW title and the old NWA title so the time came to make them one. This was a great match as these two always delivered. Sherri came to ringside before the match and revealed that she had her face painted like Sting. Therefore she would be in his corner and for most of the match it looked that way. These two traded momentum the entire time trying to outwrestle each other. Then on the outside Flair pushes Sherri into harms way but it was only a diversion. Moments later she reveals herself to be helping Flair after he wins the title.

2.[US TITLE]RICKY STEAMBOAT VS STEVE AUSTIN-these two had a great chemistry in the ring together. Like I have said about others this is a great match. Both men looked to ground the other and pound out a victory. There was a special stipulation that would see Austin loose the title if he was DQd. As it turned out that was not needed as after a great series of near falls The Dragon won the title.

3. RANDY SAVAGE & HULK HOGAN VS RIC FLAIR & THE GIANT-with was a good match involving the all time great Macho Man Randy Savage at Clash 32. This was a bit short considering it was the main event and the four men involved. Still it was a good match with a good story including Flair running into a camera man after going over the turnbuckle. This was mainly a Savage versus Flair and Hogan versus Giant match but they mixed it up enough. In the end Flair uses some brass knucks to get the win with a pinfall over Savage.

4. MADUSA VS BULL NAKANO-I always liked when these two would go at it in any organization and this was a good one. Like other reviews have said it was way too short but the action was good. This match took place at the Clash 33 with Madusa coming out on top.

5.[BATTLE BOWL RING]EDDIE GUERRERO VS DDP-in this match DDP was defending the ring he had won in a battle royal. This was an excellent match and one of my favorites on the set. Eddie starts out strong but after running into the post Page takes control dominating him with power moves. Eddie makes a comeback only to be shot down again but still ends up winning the match and the ring. Afterwards DDP nails him with diamond cutter after diamond cutter. This match was also from Clash 33.

6.[TAG TITLE]HARLEM HEAT VS STING & LEX LUGER VS THE STEINER BROTHERS-this may indeed may be my absolute favorite match on the set since it is not only a classic like many others on this set but every time I watch it I cant help but think back to that time. This was also at Clash 33 proving that it may have been the best one over all. The action is great with each team hitting their high spots and controlling the match. In this match Harlem Heat could lose the titles even if they weren't even in the ring or involved in the fall. The first team to get the pin or submission would win the titles. This was a hard hitting match full of great talent. This one evolves into a brawl on many occasions but once it spilled out side it wasn't long before the Outsiders Hall & Nash got involved. This causes a DQ and a no contest which I still think was a great ending for the match when thinking of the overall storyline involving the NOW.

7.[CRUISERWEIGHT TITLE]ULTIMATE DRAGON VS DEAN MALENKO-I know they said Ultimate Dragon but I still say Ultimo. This was a classic from Clash 34 and after watching this once again this could be my favorite match on the set. The action here is fast and furious even when it is grounded with great submissions. We have high flying, top rope, and great technical wrestling in this one. Great back and forth with Dean taking back the title, excellent match.

8.[CRUISERWEIGHT TITLE]CHRIS JERICHO VS EDDIE GUERRERO-this match took place at the final Clash which was 35. Another classic right here, there are so many matches on this set that are straight classics. These guys were so evenly match as they took turns taking control of the match. You could read what I said about the previous match and apply it here, this was great. Jericho ended winning but Eddie would get the last laugh attacking him afterward.

9.[TAG TITLES]RANDY SAVAGE & SCOTT HALL VS LEX LUGER & DDP-the final main event of the Clash ever was a tag match for the titles with the NWO taking on WCW. Here Randy Savage was in for Kevin Nash teaming with Hall to defend the belts. This was a good back and forth fight between the two factions that developed more into a brawl. It is always great to see Macho Man in there since he is a favorite or the favorite along with HBK and the Hitman. After a great battle it is DDP who causes his own team to lose after accidently hitting the diamond cutter on his own partner. It was a good present for the NWO since it was their one year birthday, but Sting would crash the party.

BONUS

1. RIC FLAIR & BARRY WINDHAM VS THE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS-this was a good tag match from Clash 4 that would see the two Horsemen members who were still in WCW against one of the greatest teams ever. This was a great contest with The Express controlling Flair for most of the match. But that would not stop the Horsemen from taking this match after some unfair tactics.

2. STING & RICJY STEAMBOAT VS RICK RUDE & STEVE AUSTIN-this tag match was from Clash 18 between four of the all time best. All four men looked good here but the heels looked the best here dominating at times. I loved Jim Ross saying the martial arts the whole time when Steamboat was on a roll. After a brawl on the outside Sting coming off the top rope lead to a face victory but in classic heel fashion Rude and Austin attacked Sting and Ricky after the match.

3.[THUNDER CAGE MATCH]DUSTIN RHODES, STING & CACTUS JACK VS VADER, PAUL ORNDORFF & BARRY WINDHAM-this fight at Clash 22 was a fun one in a unique looking cage match. The Thundercage was a huge cage that at the top came inward so no one could escape. This match was a good one with Sting and Dustin alone for most of the match taking on the other three men. Cactus Jack would come out towards the end and once inside would light up the heels with his boot which leads to the face victory.

Now while I did get my Blu-Ray from Wal-Mart for some reason I did not get the two exclusives I was supposed to. They were The Midnight Express versus The Fantastics and Hollywood Hogan versus Ric Flair. Still over all this was a great set full of classics on every dis. I would highly recommend this set to any wrestling fan out there. I am still a little upset that possibly my favorite match ever from Clash was not one here. That of course is the Taskmaster Kevin Sullivan against Chris Benoit in a crazy fight that went all around and in the arena. Still I get why they didn't put it on, still it would have been great to see on HD Blu-Ray.",1400025600,,14756,4.31324431613136

The Horseman do get the advantage Sting takes a DDT out on the floor, but the edge doesn't last long as Rhodes is tagged and takes out both men. The ref gets knocked down causing a DQ, Windham comes down locking on the claw on Dusty while Flair attacks Sting. 6/10.

-9/7/88, Clash III, Russian Chain Match, Ivan Koloff vs. Ricky Morton: An okay one here with two tag team specialists in singles action and to win you need to touch all four corners in succession. The chain gets used as a weapon, Koloff chokes out Ricky who counters with his speed and works on the left knee of Ivan, but Koloff keeps hammering him down. Morton ends up dragging Ivan to all four corners and touches them to win the match. 4/10. The post match was nice as two masked Russians and Ivan's former manager Paul Jones beat up Ivan.

-11/15/89, Clash IX, I Quit Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Ric Flair (Champion) vs. Terry Funk: Great one here as these two had a good build-up leading up to the match, it goes in and out of the ring, each man takes and gives some hard shots. Both men try submission holds like the figure four and the Funk spinning toe hold to make each other submit. Flair keeps working on the knee and locks on the figure four again and finally Terry submits. 9/10. After the match Funk say he promised he would shake Flair's hand if he won and he did.

-2/6/90, Clash X, Mil Mascaras vs. Cactus Jack Manson: Not much of a match here, Mascaras hits a lot of his usual moves, Jack does some comedy tripping over a chair on the outside for some reason. Jack does take a nasty fall hitting the concrete with the back of his head, back in the ring Mascaras hits a top rope splash and covers to win. 3/10.

-6/13/90, Clash XI, NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, The Midnight Express (Champions) w/Jim Cornette vs. The Rock 'n' Roll Express: A very long standing tag team rivalry continues with this good match as both teams countered the others moves, Morton and Gibson use their quickness to throw off Eaton and Lane. Midnight Express takes over working on both Rock 'n' Roll members, but the action breaks down after Lane stops the referee's 3 count so he calls for a DQ. 7/10.

Disc 2

-9/5/90, Clash XII, NWA United States Championship Match, Lex Luger (Champion) vs. Ric Flair: Coming into this match Flair felt if he won this match that he would get to face the World Champion Sting soon after, all he had to do was go through ""The Total Package"" Lex Luger. Having faced each other before Luger dominated with his power while Flair used his experience and dirty tactics to chop down the big man. The crowd was hot throughout the match, especially when Luger had the advantage and the closing minutes were gold with some close near falls. Suddenly Stan Hansen interferes causing a DQ and he pounds on Lex then leaves the ring. 7/10.

-6/12/91, Clash XV, 6-Man Tag Team Match, The Young Pistols & Z-Man vs. The Fabulous Freebirds: Interesting mix here with a watered down Freebirds and a quick paced trio facing them, the match starts off hot with Z-Man hitting a couple of hip tosses and the Pistols (one a pre-ECW Tracy Smothers) hitting top rope splashes. The Freebirds do target Smothers, but the Pistols and Z-Man hit triple sunset flips and get the three count. 4/10, quick but fun.

-9/5/91, Clash XVI, 15-Man Battle Royal, Participants: El Gigante, ""Stunning"" Steve Austin, ""The Natural"" Dustin Rhodes, Oz, One Man Gang, Z-Man, Terry Taylor, P.N. News, Sergant Buddy Lee Parker, Barry Windham, Tracy Smothers, Bobby Eaton, Thomas Rich, Ranger Ross and Big Josh: Really a lot of WCW mid card/jobbers here as it was more a less a match to put over the titanically awful ""El Gigante"" aka WWE's Giant Gonzales. Part of the cool aspect for older wrestling fans is seeing Austin, Rhodes, Kevin Nash as Oz in the early portion of their careers. Cool also to see Windham and Gang who were two of my favorites from my childhood. The finish is so bad as Oz has to help himself over the top rope since ""El Gigante"" couldn't accomplish that simple task, so Gigante wins. 5/10.

-11/19/91, Clash XVII, WCW United States Championship Match, Rick Rude vs. Sting (Champion): Coming into this match Sting had been receiving gifts from some guy who had a bounty on him, earlier in this night the guy turned out to be Lex Luger who injured Sting's knee and he went to the hospital. Paul E. is in the ring saying its too bad Sting can't make it, then an ambulance comes up Sting gets out, comes to the ring and takes it to Rude right at the ramp. Sting does have a good showing using some strength but sells his knee a lot, Rick gains the advantage targeting the knee and slamming it into the ring post. Sting is distracted by Paul E., Rude hits the knee then rolls up Sting for three to become the new U.S. champ. 5/10. Side Note: I personally remember this match sticking out in my mind from my youth cause I was a huge Sting fan.

-6/17/93, Clash XXIII, 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the WCW Tag Team Championship, Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs. The Hollywood Blondes: Due to being under his no complete clause with WWE, this was Flair's first WCW match in about 2 years despite being back on screen for a few months. This had some good build-up to it stemming off the ""Flair For the Old"" segment the Blondes did to mock the Horseman. Pillman showed a lot of heel tactics to get under Ric and Arn's skin and Austin also had a good showing here. We know what Flair and Anderson can do and when Ric gets in the ring the crowd goes nuts.

It was a classic tag team match with both teams cutting the ring off at various times, despite a bad knee Arn drags Austin to the outside, Ric hits a clothesline on Pillman and covers him to win the first fall. During the second fall Ric gives and takes a beating especially on the outside getting slammed into the guardrail. Arn gets tagged in and works on both, hitting the spinebuster, but Brian clips the knee then the Blondes work on it. Barry Windham runs down and attacks Flair causing the referee to throw out the match. 8/10, would've been 10/10 if not for the finish.

(Available on The Stone Cold Truth)

-11/10/93, Clash XXV, Brian Pillman vs. ""Stunning"" Steve Austin: This was shortly after they split as the Hollywood Blondes and because they know each other, they played off each other quite well. It started out intense as Pillman took it to Austin and the action spilled to the outside and this stayed pretty hard hitting throughout. After Austin's manager pulled Pillman's legs when he attempted a top rope move, Austin made the cover to win the match. 8/10.

(Available on The Legacy of Stone Cold Steve Austin)

-1/27/94, Clash XXVI, WCW World Television Title Match, Lord Steven Regal (Champion) vs. Dustin Rhodes: Odd commentary team of Bobby Heenan and Gordon Solie here, Regal did some good heel tactics and displayed great technical skill that he's known for. Dustin hit some quick offense and works on the left arm of Steven, however Regal does keep up his own offense and the match stays at a good back and forth pace. The closing minutes are great as Regal keeps stalling for time, Dustin ends up hitting the running bulldog but the 15 minute time limit expires so Regal retains. 7/10.

-1/27/94, Clash XXVI, Elimination Tag Team Match, Sting & Ric Flair vs. Rick Rude & Vader: Rick and Sting renewed their rivalry and Vader was looking for revenge after losing the title at Starrcade and with these four you simply can never go wrong. Sting fights first Rude then Vader who has a good showing, Flair gets tagged and takes it to the monster from Colorado. Back from a commercial break Sting and Rude are at it again, then Ric and Vader go at it with Vader hitting many moves to target to ribs and back including the Vader Bomb and superplex.

Nick Bockwinkel the commish steps in and stops Vader from using a chair and he and Flair (who couldn't continue) are eliminated. Sting and Rick have a good match of their own, with Sting's back being the focus of Rude's attack. Sting does come back reversing a Tombstone piledriver then hitting a top rope splash and covers to win. 7/10.

Disc 3

-6/23/94, Clash XXVII, Championship Unification Match, Sting (International Champion) vs. Ric Flair (WCW Champion):  The backstory here was WCW was breaking away from the NWA hence the title unification stipulation, along with Flair being distracted with the recent signing of Hulk Hogan. Sherri Martel came down before the bell rang and apparently will be in Sting's corner, as for the match its not a bad one as they always worked well together but the side stories do take away a little from it. Sting uses his energy and strength while Ric does the typical dirty tactics and works on the knee for the figure four.

Early on Flair seems quite off his game, Sting just is full of fire throwing the Nature Boy around, Flair keeps up the offense, but Sting sits back up after a nice delayed suplex. He dives over the top rope but he splashes Sherri against the guardrail and Sting seems concerned about her well being. Ric takes advantage rolling up Sting for three and holding the tights to win become the unified champion. 7/10. Sherri is in the ring and her and Ric hug, so it was just an set-up, then they both attack Sting, until Hogan runs down and hits Flair some knocking him to the outside.

-8/28/94, Clash XXVIII, WCW United States Championship Match, ""Stunning"" Steve Austin (Champion) vs. Ricky Steamboat: Good wrestling in this one, Steamboat works on Austin's head and neck with a headlock and they both trade chops and cut a pretty good pace in this one. With about 5 minutes left Ricky gets knocked off the top rope and lands awkwardly which would lead to his retirement soon after due to a back injury. Steamboat turns up the aggression in the closing minutes and ends up getting an inside cradle and pins Austin to win the U.S. title. 8/10.

(Available on The Legacy of Stone Cold Steve Austin)

-1/23/96, Clash XXXII, Hulk Hogan & ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair & The Giant: Main event talent based match here where there were some on going storylines with all four guys, Savage hits some quick elbows and Flair gets double teamed by both men. Once the Giant is in he throws both Savage and Hogan around, clubs at Hulk's back and slams him. Once Flair is in he hits a nice delayed suplex, Hulk gets slammed by Giant into the safety rail, finally Randy is in and he attacks Flair, Jimmy Hart distracts Savage long enough for Ric to use a foreign object to hit him and cover to win. 5/10. Zodiac and Brian Pillman attack Hogan, NFL star Kevin Greene comes in and they both throw Pillman and Zodiac out.

-8/15/96, Clash XXXIII, Medusa vs. Bull Nakano w/Sonny Onoo: This was a rare women's match in WCW featuring women that could actually wrestle, however it is quite short.  Having faced off before in WWE they knew each other well, Bull throws Medusa around by her hair a few times. Nakano uses some nunchucks behind the refs back, but Medusa doesn't stay down. Medusa hits a splash to the outside onto Sonny, back in the ring he accidentaly kicks Bull, allowing a roll-up for three. 3/10.

-8/15/96, Clash XXXIII, Match for the Battlebowl Ring, Diamond Dallas Page vs. Eddie Guerrero: Weird stipulation where DDP was putting his Battlebowl ring he recently won to get a shot at Eddie, this was during DDP's heel mode and Guerrero was on fire during this match hitting some quick moves but he goes into the ring post shoulder first. Eddie fights out of a sleeper and comes back, trading punches with DDP, he knocks DDP off the top rope, hits the frog splash and covers to win. 5/10. DDP goes to shake his hand, but hits three Diamond Cutters including one from the top.

-8/15/96, Clash XXXIII, Triple Threat Match for the WCW World Tag Team Championship: Harlem Heat (Champions) vs. The Steiner Brothers vs. Lex Luger & Sting: This was a trio of power as six men were strong, Scott hangs up Booker on the top rope and Lex hits a running clothesline knocking him outside the ring. There are some good spots here with each team breaking up pinfalls to avoid losing their chance to become champions. Nice face/off with Scott and Sting, with Steiner hitting and impressive slam but only for two, Lex tries for the Torture Rack but everyone comes in and its bedlam. As Scott has Booker down, the Outsiders interfere on the outside of the ring, referee Nic Patrick calls for a DQ which angers Scott and the fans. 6/10. As it was more about pushing the storyline of Patrick becoming a member of the NWO.

-1/21/97, Clash XXXIV, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Ultimo Dragon (Champion) w/Sonny Onoo vs. Dean Malenko: Two of my favorites here as both are great workers and know some different styles, Dean grounds Dragon with an armbar, Ultimo targets the leg of Malenko. There's some aggression for Dean, slamming Dragon's head into the turnbuckle and slapping on a head scissors on the mat, then working on the left leg with various holds. Great superplex by Malenko, then a roll-up for two, then the pace turns up, with the action going to the outside and Ultimo hits the Asai Moonsault. Sonny Onoo distracts Dean but he still somehow locks on the Texas Cloverleaf and Dragon taps out so we have a new champion. 9/10.

-8/21/97, Clash XXXV, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. Eddie Guerrero: Good but short one here with both mixing it up and Eddie was in full heel mode here, Chris hits some nice moves including sending Guerrero into the lights and down to the mat. Nice how Jericho catches Eddie from the top powerbombing him, nice suplex to the outside by Chris. Eddie comes back with a massive superplex for two, after a release german suplex for two, we have some pinfall reversals with Jericho getting the dupe as he covered Eddie for 3 to retain. 8/10, Guerrero attacks Chris laying him out.

-8/21/97, Clash XXXV, WCW Tag Team Championship Match, Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger vs. Scott Hall & ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage (Champions) w/Kevin Nash & Miss Elizabeth: There's a promo by Savage with the NWO as ballons fall from the sky to celebrate the birthday of the NWO, Nash gives Randy the opprotunity to defend his part of the tag titles in this match. There's a lot of balloon popping in the crowd in the opening minutes and it looks like Scott wants to face Luger, they have a lock-up where Lex throws him to the mat. Luger goes to the outside, Nash attacks him from behind but the ref sends him to the back, Savage and Hall beat up Lex some.

DDP gets the tag, hits some moves but is attacked from behind by Savage then both work on DDP's ribcage. Once Luger gets the tag it becomes a warzone, he slaps on the Torture Rack on Hall, Randy throws something in DDP's eyes and he accidentaly hits the Diamond Cutter on Lex. Scott covers to win to the match and retain the titles. 7/10 for the fun. The celebration by the NWO continues as they all come to the ring. Eric Bischoff cuts a promo and offers congrats to some members of the NWO. The mic goes out and the lights start to flicker, Sting is shown in the rafters as a narration is played.

(Best Buy Bonus) 3/27/88, Clash I, NWA United States Tag Team Championship Match, The Midnight Express (Champions) wJim Cornette vs. The Fantastics: Good, fast paced match with the Fantastics hitting the ring and attacking the Express, the crowd is hot througout. Rogers and Fulton are on fire, weapons like chairs and a table are used and its just an out of control brawl for the opening minutes. Finally we have a tag match, where the Express cut the ring off and work on Rogers for a few hitting a nice high/low, they just keep Rogers in their corner and beat him up for a while slamming him on a table on the outside. The ref gets sent over the top rope, another ref is in, Fulton is in, Cornette accidentaly hits Eaton with the tennis racket, the Fantastics hit the Rocket Launcher and cover to win the titles..... until the original refe reverses the decsions for being sent over the top. 8/10, there's also a post match brawl thats nice too.

(Best Buy Bonus) 8/15/96, Clash XXXIII, WCW World Heavyweight Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champions) vs. Ric Flair: Not nearly as good as their previous matches, this was about putting over a revenge storyline on Flair's end for what the NWO did to his friend Arn Anderson and also Hogan's reign beginning as a heel champion. There was some early stalling by both men, mainly Hulk though he hits some big power moves and even a few mat wrestling moves. Flair does hit some big chops and a nice double axe handle off the apron knocking Hogan into the guardrail. Shockingly Hogan hulks up, but does miss his legdrop, Ric slaps on the figure four, Hogan throws the ref down, the Outsiders hit the ring to attack Flair then the Horsemen, Luger and Sting come down to the ring. The ref does call for the DQ, so Ric wins but doesn't win the title. 5/10, for the poor finish.

There's some good contests here like the first match between Ric and Sting at the first Clash along with a few other good matches, but this is a mixed bag of good and bad and honestly a lot of the matches are either short or just aren't that exciting. So if you have a few of the sets some of these matches are already on then you have most of the best in your collection, yes the Malenko/Dragon contest is good, great even but its hardly worth getting this set for.",1342396800,,19416,4.544647967945049
5062689,3,B0077PTWNM,"The other reviews are fine and dandy telling what's in this set. It's fine for what it is, but unless there's a volume two coming out some day, which I sincerely doubt, this cannot truly be called ""The Best of WCW Clash of the Champions."" So this review is admittedly to nit-pick about what is not included in this set.

I - I've read that The Midnight Express vs. The Fantastics is included in some versions of this set. Well, it wasn't on mine, and that's a shame because it is at least one of the top three tag team matches in Clash history. The action starts before the bell rings and is pretty much non-stop tag team wrestling with the best in the business (Eaton and Lane) against a top-flight duo to work with. It's a shame this isn't the first match on this set, and that some who buy it are missing out.
II - The Barry Windham-Brad Armstrong match would've been a nice addition to this one. It's a better match than the tag match they did include from this Clash, but no big omission.
III - Rotundo-Armstrong would've been MUCH better here than Morton-Koloff.
IV - The Flair/Windham vs. Midnights match absolutely should've been on all versions of this set.
V - No matches to add here, but Steamboat stripping Flair of his clothes would've been a fun segment to include.
VI - I know the Steamboat-Flair 2/3 falls match is on other WWE sets, but if this is supposed to be the best of the Clash, how can you exclude what might be the best match of the '80s, much less any Clash?
VII - Steamboat-Funk maybe? With Luger turning heel after the match? But no big omissions here.
VIII - Sting-Flair vs. Slater-Muta with Funk trying to suffocate Flair. Should've been on the set.
IX and X - No complaints.
XI - Luger over Sid in less than a minute just to? No big deal.
XII and XIII - No complaints.
XIV - Flair vs. Scott Steiner when the latter could still wrestle should've been included. This match isn't as good as some have made it out to be, but it's still worthy of inclusion.
XV - Flair vs. Bobby Eaton should be on there.
XVI - The battle royal was unnecessary, but the Luger-Simmons press conference is underrated comedy.
XVII - It's an absolute travesty that the Steamboat/Rhodes vs. Anderson/Zbyszko match isn't on here. One of my favorite matches ever and a top three all time Clash tag match.
XVIII - Sting/Steamboat vs. Rude/Austin should be on all versions.
XIX - Steiners vs. Williams/Gordy
XX - No complaints, but Steamboat-Austin for the TV title. I can understand though with there being another match between these two on the set.
XXI - Steamboat/Douglas vs. Windham/Rhodes

And I'll stop here. 1993 was terrible for the most part and Hogan came in in '94. The quality dropped off for a while and by the time guys like Benoit and Malenko and Jericho were in WCW Clashes were few and far between and I don't really remember them. Make no mistake. This is a good set, but it should've been great. It's just lacking.",1341878400,3,2935,4.4636871508379885
5062690,5,B0077PTWNM,it was a dvd watch to see some of the wrestler from the past i never got to see any of clash of champions  before,1341619200,,113,3.52
5062691,5,B0077PTWNM,"While I agree that the Sting vs. Flair world title match would go down as the greatest Clash match of all time, they should have also included the second greatest match: Sting vs. Nikita Koloff.",1340582400,,194,4.571428571428571
5062692,4,B0077PTWNM,"I was really stoked when I heard the WWE were releasing a collection of the Clash and I was pretty happy with the outcome.  I do wish there was a documentary to go along with the matches but I'm still happy with what the WWE put out.

The first match is the main event of the first Clash between Ric Flair and Sting for the NWA World title.  The match is a classic and goes to a 45 minute draw.  It is also the match that many people, myself included, made Sting the superstar that he is today.  The match is very well contested and made all of the matches from Wrestlemania IV (held on the same night) pale in comparison.

Up next is another match from the same event as Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard defend the NWA Tag titles against the team of Barry Windham and Lex Luger.  This match is just plain good.  The fans for some reason are just rabid during this match and I think that's one of the reasons it's so good.  It's kind of short, clocking in at like 10:00, but still worth watching.

Up next is another tag title match from Clash II involving Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard defending the tag titles again against Dusty Rhodes and Sting.  This was another good match and again clocking in at around 10:00 but again worth seeing.  To me anything with Sting in it is worth watching.

The next match is pretty suprising as they chose to put on Ricky Morton vs Ivan Koloff in their Russian Chain match from Clash III.  I don't know I just found it to be a suprising pick but it was a good pick.  Of course there is some blood but these two do use the chain rather well and have a pretty good match.  Still, if I was choosing a match from this Clash I would have picked Sting against Windham.

The next match is a classic between Ric Flair and Terry Funk from Clash IX in an ""I Quit"" match.  Many have said this may have been the first real main stream hardcore match and after viewing it I kind of agree with it.  These guys leave it all hanging out and then some in this classic.  I like the use of the microphone although sometimes you can't hear what Flair says.  I like the use of the tables in the match and Flair's chops are just freaking killer.  Just put on your surround sound and listen to the sweet sound of Terry Funk's chest being turned to hamburger meat.  All in all good match and great choice for the set.

This next match blows my mind as to why it's on here:  It's the Clash X match with Mil Mascaras taking on Cactus Jack Manson.  This match sucks and the only reason I can think of as to why it's on here is because of the WWE trying to reach a bigger Latin audience.  That's great and all but jeez pick a better one then this.  Even Mick Foley said Mascaras was one of the most unprofessional wrestlers he has ever worked with.

The last match on the first disc features the Midnight Express taking on the Rock n Roll Express for the NWA Tag title at Clash XI.  This is an awesome match with 4 of the best tag wrestlers ever!  This match is fast paced and features some great back and forth wrestling.  The only downside is the DQ decision at the end but still worth checking out.

The first match of disc 2 is a US title match with Lex Luger taking on Ric Flair.  I love all of their matches and this one is no different.  Great wrestling, great psychology and all around great action make this match another one worth viewing.  It's another DQ match but it's still worth viewing.

Up next is a 6 man tag from Clash 15 with the Young Pistols and Tom Zenk taking on the Freebirds and Badstreet.  This match is ok and has some cool spots but I'm still wondering why it's on this set.

The next match is the Battle Royal from Clash XVI which is actually the first Clash that I saw as a kid.  Again this is another one of those matches where you're left scratching your head.  It's a good match and El Gigante (aka Giant Gonzales) wins but I still can't understand why it's on here.

The next one is Sting defending the US title against Rick Rude from Clash XVII.  This match is ok but I would have prefered the 20 minute draw they had at Clash XXI.  This one is subpar mainly because Sting was supposed to be hurt during the match.  Earlier in the show a package or gift was presented to Sting and Madusa was in it.  While she was flirting with him Lex Luger came out and attacked Sting.  So he was still showing signs of being hurt for this match and it kind of took away from it.  Still, it's a Sting match and worth viewing.

The next match is the 2/3 fall match for the WCW Tag titles between Brian Pillman and Steve Austin vs Ric Flair and Arn Anderson.  This was a great match even though the ending is pretty crappy.  I enjoyed all the time we see Austin and Flair in the ring with each other but one thing I didn't like is the fact that they edited out Jesse Ventura's commentary.  We only hear Tony Schvonie's commentary and it is kind of hard to watch because of that.  I don't know why they just didn't get Austin or Anderson or both to step in and do some guest commentary with JR or Michael Cole or Matt Striker.  That would have been better then gaps in the commentary.  Still, the match is fun to watch.

Up next is a match between Brian Pillman and Steve Austin.  This is after Austin turned on Pillman and joined the Studd Stable.  It's a good match but I honestly don't think it was good enough to be on this set.

After that one we get another suprising match with Dustin Rhodes and Steven Regal going at it for the WCW TV title.  This was a great contest between two very underrated wrestlers.  The match does go to a draw but it is very well worth seeing.

The last match of disc 2 is an Elimination match with Sting and Ric Flair taking on Rick Rude and Vader.  This match is very very good and I was so glad that I found out that it was going to be on the set.  It is really a dream match with 4 of the biggest stars at the time going at it.  The match goes for like 22:00 and that was pretty long for a televised match at the time.  Flair gets eliminated early on like after maybe 10:00 or so because of a massive suplex Vader gives him.  Then Vader is eliminated at the same time by DQ so the rest of the match is between Sting and Rude and these two deliver another great match up.  This one is worth the price of the DVD set alone!

The last disc starts with the Unification match of the WCW World and International titles when Sting once again takes on Ric Flair.  This isnt't Clash I again but it is still an enjoyable match.  I do feel that the whole Sherri storyline that goes along with the match takes away from it but it's still worth seeing Flair unify the titles and add to his legacy.

The next match is a US title match between Steve Austin and Ricky Steamboat.  As always this is a great match between the two and if I'm not mistaken this was Ricky's last match in the WCW due to an injury he received.  Classic wrestling, great match.

The next match is another really good one from Clash XXXII when Ric Flair and the Giant take on Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage.  This is a big time match and all 4 guys I thought brought it for this one.  This is also the match where Elizabeth makes her debut.  The fact that Flair and Giant won made me smile ear to ear when I was younger and when I watched it again here recently it made me do it again.

The next match is a women's match from Clash XXXIII between Madusa and Bull Nakano.  These two always put on classics and this one was no different.  Awesome contest between one of the best from Japan and in my opinion the greatest American women's wrestler of all time Madusa.  I'm hoping because they have been putting her (Madusa) on some of the last few DVD releases that maybe she'll go into the Hall of Fame and has finally gotten over the embarrasment of dumping the WWE Women's title in the trash at WCW.

Now we get another head scratcher as DDP takes on Eddie Guerrero for the Battle Bowl ring.  It was a good match, don't get me wrong but neither one of these guys were big stars at the time so I'm not sure why their match was included on this set.  Still though, watch it, cause it is a good match.

The next match is a Triple Threat match with the Steiners taking on Harlem Heat as well as Sting and Lex Luger for the WCW Tag titles.  This is a good match but the ending with the match being declared a no contest kind of took away from it all.  Still worth seeing.

The next match was Ultimo Dragon defending the WCW Cruiserweight title against Dean Malenko.  This match, as is always the case with these two, was very well done and well worth seeing.  I'm not so sure if it was as good as their Starrcade 1996 match for the 9 Cruiserweight titles but it was still worth seeing.

The next match was from the very last Clash and it featured Chris Jericho defending the WCW Cruiserweight title against Eddie Guerrero.  This was another good match and again was another match that was well worth seeing.

The last match was the main event from the last Clash as it was Lex Luger and DDP taking on Scott Hall and Randy Savage.  Honestly, Hall is not worth seeing in this match but everyone else carries the match and makes it well worth seeing.  I can't remember now for the life of me whether we get to see Sting with the vulture at the end but even without that segment it's still worth seeing.

There are some extra matches on Blu Ray and if you bought this at Best Buy you received two bonus matches.  I didn't get either one of these but because I've seen every Clash event I can tell you about the matches.  The first BR match is a tag match with the Midnight Express taking on Ric Flair and Barry Windham.  This was at Clash IV and was a very good match that I wish was on the regular DVD set.  The match goes about 17:00 and does have Flair and Windham going over but this was an instant classic.  The next bonus BR match we get is from Clash XVIII and it features another tag match with Steve Austin and Rick Rude taking on Sting and Ricky Steamboat.  This is another match that I wish was on the regular DVD set but sadly WWE decided to put it on the BR set only.  This is a fantastic match that actually features the top 4 contenders for the WCW World title.  Great contest and well worth seeing.  The final BR bonus match we get is the Thundercage match from Clash XXII as Sting and Dustin Rhodes took on Vader, Paul Orndorff and Barry Windham.  This was yet another match that should have been on the regular DVD set.  Fantastic contest that I believe was originally supposed to be a 8 man tag.  The match was supposed to be Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Van Hammer and Ron Simmons taking on Vader, Rick Rude, Barbarian and Barry Windham.  That would have been good but what you get is even better.  Great contest and also features Cactus Jack turning good.

If you bought this DVD set at Best Buy then there was 2 other matches your could have gotten.  The first one was Hulk Hogan taking on Ric Flair for the WCW World title at Clash XXXIII.  This was not their best match together and I am glad this one was not on the regular set.  It's a terrible match with the two and it ends in DQ, so it's not worth seeing.  The final BB bonus match was the Midnight Express taking on the Fantastics for the NWA US title from Clash I.  This was a pretty good match but again I am glad WWE kept this off the regular set.

So, all in all this is a pretty good set.  Of course there are some matches I wish was on here like:  Sting and Ric Flair taking on Dick Slater and Great Muta from Clash VIII, the Steiners taking on Doom for the NWA Tag titles and also Doom's masks on the line from Clash X, Ric Flair taking on Bobby Eaton for the NWA World title in a 2/3 falls match at Clash XII (this one in particular is one I was suprised was not on the set as it requested a lot by fans), Lex Luger taking on Rick Steiner for the WCW World title at Clash XVII which is a very underrated match, Steiners taking on Steve Williams and Terry Gordy at Clash XIX, Shane Douglas and Ricky Steamboat taking on Steve Austin and Brian Pillman for the WCW Tag titles at Clash XXII, and there are many more that I won't mention at this time.  Here's hoping for Best of the Clash of the Champions Vol II.",1340236800,6,12204,4.157490396927017
5062693,3,B0077PTWNM,"Others have done a good job detailing what's on here, but for those wondering, some of the original entrance music and Jesse Ventura's commentary are not included. So, during The Hollywood Blondes vs Ric Flair & Arn Anderson, and Brian Pillman vs. Steve Austin, expect to have a disjointed commentary, since only Tony Schiavone's part of the commentary is included. All in all, not a bad collection of matches, but the edits are annoying.",1339977600,3,438,4.9324324324324325
5062694,3,B0077PTWNM,"I don't often buy wrestling DVD's but when I saw this and some of the match listings I thought I had to get it. There are some definite all time classic matches in this set and may even make the purchase price worth it however there are some real bad matches on here that can in no way shape or form be considered the ""BEST"" of the Clash.  When you see Rock & Roll vs Midnight Express you think...great match but what we got was a lame DQ finish match.  I would have rather seen the DOOM vs Steiner Brothers title match they refer to during the R&R/Midnight match. The Cactus Jack match was horrible. Does anyone really want to see Ricky Morton in a Russian Chain match with Ivon Koloff? The battle royal was ok until the end when you see ""Oz"" jump over the top rope because El Gigante (Also read as...horrible mistake) couldn't even push him over the top.  Z-Man?  He's the BEST OF THE CLASH? No..and that version of the Freebirds was pitiful.

As I said, some definite classics here but I wouldn't classify this as the ""Best of the Clash""  I would say this is more WWE trying to show once again that they're better by making you think these lame matches were the best that the NWA/WCW could offer at the time.",1339718400,3,1211,4.2894736842105265

5062696,4,B0077PTWNM,"Before the era of ""WCW Monday Nitro"", there was one event available on cable television where you had the matches after match featuring the superstars of the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling against each other.  WWE has ""Saturday Night's Main Event"" while NWA/WCW had theirs in ""The Clash Of The Champions.""  Dusty Rhodes host this DVD set while it should also be noted that Jesse Ventura's commentary has been removed from the matches he was involved in.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - It should be noted that Horsemen manager J.J. Dillion was suspended in a cage to prevent interference in this match while there were also 3 judges at ringside (Penthouse model Patty Mullen & NWA executives Sandy Scott & Gary Juster) to make a ruling incase the match went to a draw.  Both men were feeling each other early before Sting was able to get control staying one step ahead of Flair & constantly going back to a specific series of basic holds while also showcasing his strength with offense focusing on a specific area of the body while Flair also worked over different areas of the body with his trademark offense including chops so hard that you saw a cut on Sting's chest as they continued to trade momentum throughout this match with Flair living up to his nickname of being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" taking a shortcut whenever possible while Sting fought back including using some of Flair's own offense against him resulting in a match that made Sting a household name overnight in what has gone down as a classic encounter that has stood the test of time today.

[Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection]

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - The team also known as the ""Twin Towers"" dominated the first half of this match to the point where Luger he got the Torture Rack on Tully in the first minute & Barry had a sleeperhold so tight on Tully that he was able to keep it on when they both rolled out of the ring. The Horsemen later caught up & did what they did best in tag team wrestling by cutting the ring in half & making their quick tags having this match go back & forth between both teams with the crowd hot the entire time. James J. Dillion got involved in the end as this match didn't go long but it was non-stop action from start to finish.
Mar. '88
[Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen; Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upperhand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.
June '88
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

Russian Chain Match: Ricky Morton vs. Ivan  Koloff - This chain match was held under the rules that you had to touch all four corners to win.  Both men used the chain as a weapon throughout the match from choking, using it to give a low blow, and whip each other while also telling the story of Morton being lighter in weight, he had more trouble pulling Koloff.  The quality is what you usually expect in this type of match but the biggest story came afterwords due to Paul Jones making it clear that this was ""make it or break it"" for the weak link in Koloff.
Sept. '88

""I Quit"" Match: Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - Despite Flair being the World Champion, this was a non-title match has it evolved past the championship into a fight about pride to the point where both men agreed that the loser would shake the winners hand.  Flair was very physical here with his chops from the start to the point where Funk was knocked down & outside numerous times.  Funk retaliated by brawling using his taped fist & even the microphone & even trying to choke Flair into giving up.  Both men fought on the outside with Funk going for a ""slip & slide"" on the ringside table right into a chair before Flair began to work over & punish Funk's leg.  Ric Flair has his more ""unique"" series of matches in his career against Terry Funk & this match is no exception as Flair wrestled a more aggressive offensive style here while Funk was his usual self in being a hardcore brawl while able to do little things to make some comedic moments.
Nov. '89
[Ultimate Ric Flair Collection; Legends Of Wrestling: Roddy Piper & Terry Funk]

Mil Mascaras vs. Cactus Jack Manson - In a nutshell, this was just Cactus being a body for Mascaras to showcase himself with his various submissions & high flying while Cactus at one took a hard hit falling off the apron with his head smacking the concrete floor.
Feb. '90

NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. Rock N' Roll Express - One of the greatest rivalries in tag team history continued here with the R&R Express being able to keep staying one step ahead causing the Midnight Express to resort to dirty tactics to gain the advantage while continuing to slow down the pace & double team to keep it before the momentum would trade back & forth between both teams.  This wasn't their best encounter but definitely a quality match.
June '90

NWA United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Ric Flair - While Luger & Flair have had countless encounters throughout their career for the World Championship, this was a different match than all of them as Luger was the champion while Flair was the challenger as he wanted to win the title to become the #1 contender to WCW Champion Sting.  Luger showed his power advantage early on with constant full body press slams on Flair before Flair cheated to get the advantage & worked over Luger's back to take away his power by throwing him into the guardrail numerous times while Flair also targeted Luger's leg using the ringpost as well before Luger got a heavy adrenaline rush & continued to use his power against Flair including a middle rope superplex.  This is definitely a ""lost"" match in their long term series of matches in NWA/WCW but wasn't up there with the quality of their World Title matches.
Sept. '90

The Young Pistols & Z-Man vs. The Fabulous Freebirds - The Freebirds were doing the ""rock band"" gimmick at this time with their manager being ""Diamond"" Dallas Page, road manager being Big Daddy Dink (Sir Oliver Humperdink), and the recently added masked third member in Badstreet.  This match was too quick to really make anything of note past it showcasing the speed of the Pistols & Z-Man.
June '91

15-Man Battle Royal - This was just an average battle royal that really didn't have any standout moments past serving it's purpose in trying to establish El Gigante as the next Andre The Giant however it was interesting to see various wrestlers before the more famous runs in the business like Dustin ""Goldust"" Rhodes (""The Natural""), Kevin Nash (Oz), and Steve Austin (""Stunning"").
Sept. '91

WCW United States Champion Sting vs. Rick Rude - Rick Rude came to WCW a month earlier at Halloween Havoc alongside Paul E. Dangerously & Madusa declaring his intentions of gaining the United States Championship while also during this time, Sting was receiving various gifts while also having a bounty put on out him from a mystery person who was revealed earlier in the night to be Lex Luger who attacked Sting's previously injured leg to the point where he was in the hospital only to return for this match with his leg wrapped up.  Sting was fighting on adrenaline as they fought on the ramp with Sting slamming Rude on it before doing a hit & move strategy while hopping on one leg as Rude did focus on the knee with clips & using the ringpost while Dangerously got involved as well but Sting just couldn't overcome the odds against him due to the earlier attack. This was more to just get the title off him as he would focus on the Luger & the World Championship after this match but this would also be the first match in the classic feud between Sting & Rude in WCW.  I would have preferred their 30 minute ""King Of Cable"" tournament encounter at the Clash a year later but this was more important in terms of a significance.
Nov. '91

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: WCW/NWA Tag Team Champions Hollywood Blondes vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Despite Ric Flair returning to WCW months earlier at the SuperBrawl III PPV, this was actually his in-ring return.  Austin & Pillman kept mocking Flair & Anderson in regards to their age at times only for both men to respond with their trademark fist & chops as Flair looked like he hadn't lost a step causing the Blondes to work over Anderson's knee with moves like the half crab.  Both teams traded momentum back & forth throughout the match as ""old timers"" in the Horsemen kept up with the younger Blondes & even had them beat at various times throughout the match.
June '93
[Stone Cold Truth]

Brian Pillman vs. Steve Austin - Only a short time after the previous match would Pillman injure his ankle while the Blondes would not only lose the tag titles but also break up as a team when Austin chose Col. Parker as his manager over Pillman as his partner.  Pillman jumped Austin in the ring before the bell & brought the fight to Austin including a hard chop that knocked him down before Austin was able to gain some offense working over the ankle with moves like the half crab.  Both men went back & forth from here before Col. Parker would once again be the factor in the issue between both men here.  The match wasn't long but really came off as a high intense grudge match.
Nov. '93
[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

WCW Television Champion Steven Regal vs. Dustin Rhodes - Before the days of William Regal & Goldust, they met here in a match with a 15 minute time limit that was a real technical match from start to finish with both men grounding each other while working the same pace throughout the match before Dustin realized that time was running out & picked up the pace while Regal tried to use the rules to his advantage as the champion.  Back in the days of the WCW Television Championship during the mid-90's, this was the belt that established Steven (William) Regal in WCW & this showcased why as he wasn't just a get technical wrestler but a smart one as well.
Jan. '94

Elimination Match: Sting & Ric Flair vs. Rick Rude & Vader - It should be noted that along with Tony Schavone, Bobby Heenan (announcer) & Nick Bockwinkle (Commissioner) were on commentary as both men made their WCW debuts that night.  Vader came into this match with one thing in mind after losing the WCW Title to Flair at Starrcade the previous month & that's hurting Flair which he did the moment he was able to by targeting Flair's back with various splashes, Vader Bomb, and 2 superplexes before the WCW Commissioner had to step in as Vader as about to cross the line.  Sting & Rude delivered the performance that we would expect to reignite their long term feud but this was all about the story between Flair & Vader.
Jan. '94

Unification Match: WCW International Champion Sting vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - For those who don't know the story behind the WCW International Championship, WCW not only had their World Championship but were also having the then-NWA Championship defended on their events as well (think of the WCW title on WWE TV back in 2001).  However when WCW & NWA were no longer working together, WCW kept the title & renamed it the WCW International Championship causing two world championships in the company (think of the WWE Title & World Heavyweight Title in current WWE) leading to this match to unify the titles.  It should also be noted that Sherri Martel revealed that she would be in Sting's corner as her manager before the match while Hulk Hogan made his official WCW debut earlier in the night.  Flair showed from the very start that he wasn't completely focused on the match as he was easily distracted from the fans to the cameraman allowing Sting to take advantage & dominate early causing Flair to constantly go to the outside to the point where he got real close to being counted out & disqualified at some points in the match.  Sting was able to keep countering & no selling Flair's offense before Flair was able to capitalize on Sting missing a move before Flair tried dirty tactics like having his feet on the ropes & throwing Sting over the top rope when the referee wasn't looking.  Both men went back & forth from here with Sting getting the upper hand before Flair resorted to shoving Sherri in the way of danger to get an advantage.  While this doesn't measure up to their previous & future classic matches, this was definitely another chapter in their long time feud along with it being a rare gem due to the unification stipulation.
June '94
[Ultimate Ric Flair Collection]

WCW United States Champion Steve Austin vs. Ricky Steamboat - This match had a special stipulation in that Austin could lose the championship on a disqualification.  Steamboat's offense consisted of grounding Austin with headlocks & armbars & chops including delivering one that knocked down Austin to the ground before working over his arm including using the ring post.  Both men would continue to trade chops while Austin would continue to mock Steamboat by slapping him around & shoving his face into the ground including one moment when Steamboat went for a superplex only for Austin to knock him off & have Steamboat land on his tailbone.  Austin has said that Steamboat was his favorite guy to be in the ring with & you'll see why here as they gave a performance in a series of matches that would be overshadowed by the Hogan/Flair feud in WCW like how it did during this match itself.  This match would later hold more importance as it would turn out to be Steamboat's last match for up to 15 years as he retired the next month.
Aug. '94
[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair & The Giant - It should be noted that Savage defeated Flair to regain the WCW Championship the night before on Nitro while NFL Star Kevin Greene was in Hogan & Savage's corner along with Ms. Elizabeth who was making her WCW debut.  Flair kept mocking Greene early before he got in the ring with Flair backing off.  Savage was in control early to the point where Flair was knocked over the turnbuckle into a cameraman & hitting Hogan's big boot on the apron before falling to the floor.  Giant regained the momentum & dominated with his size & power before Hogan started to make a comeback resorting to double teaming & dirty tactics to keep the advantage.  This was a good match with everyone involved & did it's job in continuing the feuds going into the next PPV.

Madusa vs. Bull Nakano - This was a rematch from the Hog Wild PPV earlier in the week as Bull started out with hair drags that would spin Madusa in circles & even used nun-chucks behind the referees back causing Madusa to comeback with shoulder takedowns & even taking a shot on Sonny Onoo on the outside.  This wasn't the quality that we got from their WWE days two years earlier but for the limited times that WCW actually had a women wrestling, this was one of the best matches in they've had in that ""division.""
Aug. '96

Eddie Guerrero vs. Dallas Page - It was during this time that Dallas Page was defending a championship called ""Lord Of The Ring"" which was the ring that he won by winning the BattleBowl battle royal back at Slamboree.  Eddie was in control with his fast paced offense but crashed & burned when he hit the ringpost shoulder first allowing DDP to focus on the midsection with moves like the gutbuster.  Eddie regained the advantage before DDP hit a jawbreaker & impactful powerbomb before Page left an opening for Eddie to take advantage off before DDP showed afterwords (3 times...3 times...3 times) that he wasn't taking what happened lightly.
Aug. '96

WCW World Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat vs. Steiner Brothers vs. Sting & Lex Luger - This was a triangle match where the first time score a pinfall/submission would become the Tag Team Champions regardless of which team was pinned.  This had some moments where all 3 teams were involved in the action like Booker being crotched on the ropes by Steiner before Luger clotheslined him off the ropes to the floor, Rick Steiner making the blind tag on Luger & coming in clotheslining members of both teams, and Luger breaking up his pin on Booker right afterwords.  This told a good story of each team wanting to get into the action to become the champions with the blind tags & it being every team for themselves but it would be the issues with the controversial calls of Nick Patrick & The Outsiders who played the wild cards in this match.
Aug. '96

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Ultimate Dragon vs. Dean Malenko - This was Malenko's last title shot after losing the Crusierweight Title to Dragon at Starrcade & the previous night on Nitro as Dragon started out with fast & stiff kicks including one that was so loud that Malenko had to go to the outside to recover.  Malenko came back with a back suplex that dropped Dragon right on his head & focused on the leg with twist & stretches, stomps including on the guardrail, half crab, and figure four.  The action really picked up towards the end with Malenko delivering a superplex, Dragon countering a powerbomb with the schoolboy pin attempt before the asisa moonsault on the outside & later a frankensteiner off the top rope, and Malenko with a powerbomb into the Texas Cloverleaf.  This was the exact type of action you would expect from the crusierweight decision.
Jan. '97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero - Eddie came into the match very cocky early & tried to show off only for Jericho to respond taking Eddie off guard having him hide behind the referee & falsely accuse Jericho of pulling his hair while Jericho just looked on saying ""Your better than that Eddie.""  From here, the match was very fast paced with non-stop action from both men including a frankensteiner from the top rope by Eddie, Jericho attempting a springboard crossbody from inside the ring to the floor,  Eddie superplexed from the apron to the floor, and Jericho delivering a release german suplex.  Both men were counter for counter here until in the end, it was all about who was able to get caught that determined the winner.  This was more of a preview to their more famous match at the Fall Brawl PPV the next month.
Aug. '97

WCW Tag Team Champions Scott Hall & Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger & Dallas Page - This would turn out to the final main event on the final Clash Of The Champions event as the nWo were celebrating their birthday on this show with Kevin Nash allowing Savage to defend his half of the tag titles in this match.  Nash & Elizabeth remained at ringside before Nash eventually got involved being sent to the back as both teams exchanged momentum before the nWo singled out DDP & worked him over building to the hot tag to Luger but it was a miscommunication between Luger & Page that would work towards the nWo's advantage but it was said...or not said...by Sting that left the final impression.
Aug. '97

(Blu-Ray) Ric Flair & Barry Windham vs. Midnight Express - This was a unique match for this time as Flair & Windham were not only the top two singles wrestlers in the company (holding the World & U.S. titles) but also the final two members of the Horsemen against not only one of the top tag teams in the company but also the team who took the tag team titles from the other two Horsemen members in Anderson & Blanchard right before they left for WWE.  Flair tried to intimidate Eaton early who his ""Whoo!"" before Eaton responded by popping him in the mouth & knocking Flair down with both members of the Express eventually showing off against Flair as they had control with their counters to the double team attempts by the Horsemen.  Flair & Windham did whatever they could to get the advantage & keep it from double teaming moves to their manager J.J. Dillion getting involved leading to a fight between him & Cornette.  Good quality tag team match.
Dec. '88

(Blu-Ray) Sting & Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude & Steve Austin - This was a rare match in that the top 4 contenders for the WCW Championship were all in one match as members of the Dangerous Alliance were going against two of their top targets in Sting & Steamboat.  This a fun main event to say the least as Sting & Steamboat clearly had the strategy of ""beat them at their own game"" as they openly broke the rules various times such as not tagging in & out of the match only to switch behind the referees back, using moves like a back rake, Sting giving the atomic drop on both sides of Rick Rude, and both men covering one member of the other team.  Again, a fun main event at this Clash with (for those trivia fans) being one of the first encounters between Steamboat & Austin in a feud that would be revisited in singles & tag team divisions for over the next 3 years in WCW.
Jan. '92

(Blu-Ray) ThunderCage Match: Dustin Rhodes & Sting vs. Big Van Vader, Paul Orndorff, Barry Windham - For those who have never seen a ThunderCage match before, it's WCW's version of ""Hell In A Cell"" where it's a giant steel cage that surrounds not only the ring but the ringside area as well with the top of the cage bent inwards so nobody can escape.  This match was originally scheduled to be an eight man tag but due to various injuries & angles throughout the night, we ended up getting a tag team handicap match.  While the cage looked impressive, the match itself fell below expectations as they never left first gear to the point where the match was dull until another man made an appearance who had his recent issues with Vader to even out the odds & eventually kick off what would be one of the most physically violent feuds in WCW history with Vader.
Jan. '93

(Walmart Bonus) NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. The Fantastics - You knew exactly where this match was going from the opening minute as both teams started brawling to the floor the minute they were in the ring with chairs coming into play right away before a table was used along with more chairs including Jim Cornette on the outside throwing them.  Midnight Express kept control in the ring with their double team moves including one point where Cornette held up the table on the outside so Rogers' head could be ran right into it before Eaton pulled out some power moves of his own like the powerslam.  They continued to work over Tommy Rogers keeping him away from Robert Fulton before taking the action back to the outside where Rogers was no only slammed on but also bulldog onto the flat table.  Rogers was eventually able to make the tag to Fulton but the referee couldn't see it & also couldn't see the Express double teaming with Cornette getting involved again causing him to not take it anymore & all hell breaking loose with referees getting thrown over the top rope, Cornette attacking everyone in sight with his tennis racket, and a people getting whipped with a leather belt.  This was a very aggressive match for it's time from start to finish.
Mar. '88

(Walmart Bonus) WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Ric Flair - A couple of side notes here in that Hogan joined the nWo only two months earlier before winning the WCW Championship & spray painting it earlier in the week at the Hog Wild PPV while Flair was out for revenge for the nWo attack on Arn Anderson backstage weeks earlier on Nitro while Tony Schavone mentioned on commentary that these two had also met in a WCW Championship match two years earlier the same month at another Clash event.  Both men tried to show each other up early with Hogan mocking Flair's strut & ""WHOO!"" while Flair got his slaps in on Hogan as well before Hogan was able to take Flair down & get a hammerlock on but Flair responded with his trademark chops that sent Hogan down to the floor.  Hogan came back & used his power which included whipping Flair hard into the corner to the point where he flipped over to the floor where Hogan threw Flair into the post.  Flair resort to being ""The Dirtiest Player In The Game"" in order to regain his advantage but Hogan ""Hulked Up"" but ended up missing the legdrop allowing Flair to get the figure four before The Outsiders came out to save Hogan.  This wasn't anywhere near their previous encounters as far as quality goes but did it's job in furthering the feud between WCW & the New World Order.
Aug. '96

As usual with these DVD sets, they can't include each match that was either high on quality in-ring action or name value but at least some of these selections were released on recent DVD sets (like the Enforcers vs. Steamboat & Rhodes tag match) so I can't really complain there.  I just know that four matches I would have loved to see on here is the Van Hammer vs. Cactus Jack Falls Count Anywhere match as that was just absolutely nuts, the Steiners vs. Williams & Gordy tag match, Steamboat & Douglas vs. Windham & Rhodes, and the Sting vs. Rude 30 minute King Of Cable semi-final encounter but you can't win them all.  In the end, this was a nice trip down memory lane & can only hope for a volume two but for now, I recommend.",1338249600,6,25419,4.539706847516955
5062697,5,B0077PTWNM,"WWE is back with another Best Of compilation. This time it's WCW Clash Of The Champions. I just watched this set. I did not care for some of these as I was not a fan of WCW aside from a certain number of wrestlers. SO I skipped over some of the stuff and will review only what I saw.

DISC 1

Ric Flair vs. Sting - 03/27/88
This took place at the first CLash Of The Champions event. If you are a big fan or a casual fan of any Sting persona, you should totally watch this match. I am not a fan of Ric Flair because I don't like his ring style. But this is one FLair match I was able to get through in it's entirety. Great showing by both legends here. This is the match that ended in a 45 minute draw.

Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - 03/27/88

Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - 06/08/88
All four men really entertained me in this match. I expected Arn & Blanchard to make an excellent team since they were members of The Horsemen. But Dusty & Sting, two singles wrestlers also made a great team themselves.

Ricky Morton vs. Ivan Koloff - 09/07/88

Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - 11/15/89

Mil Mascaras vs. Cactus Jack Manson - 02/06/90
One of the few matches I saw that did not contain Sting. After watching Mil's HOF Induction and him being talked about by Rey Mysterio in The Life Of A Masked Man , I was curious about him. After seeing this match, I am now a fan of his and wished I saw him back in the day. But there's always youtube for that.

Midnight Express vs. Rock & Roll Express - 06/13/90
Upon reading on JR's blog about this rivalry, I decided to check out a match between the two teams. This is a great tag bout. One of the best I've seen and I've seen many tag bouts in my lifetime. If WWE wants to revitalize their dead tag division, they could learn from this match.

DISC 2

To Be The Man, You Gotta Beat The Man

Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - 09/05/90

The Young Pistols & Z-Man vs. The Fabulous Freebirds - 06/12/91

15-Man Battle Royal - 09/05/91

Sting vs. Rick Rude - 11/19/91
Tremendous one on one match here between two men who many, including me feel are worthy of a HOF Induction.

Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs. The Hollywood Blonds - 06/17/93
I found this 2 Out of 3 Falls tag match entertaining. Three HOFers and one man who I feel will go in some day and that one man is Brian Pillman. Great showing here.

Brian Pillman vs. ""Stunning"" Steve Austin - 11/10/93
Five months after they teamed up, Austin & Pillman go one on one. A match I thoroughly enjoyed because I feel whenever you see two former partners go one on one, you know you'll get a good match because they know each other well from their tag teaming days. And when I say that, I mean legitimately well established tag teams and not two men who are thrown together and they go their separate ways a short time later.

Lord Steven Regal vs. Dustin Rhodes - 01/27/94

Sting & `Nature Boy' Ric Flair vs. Rick Rude & Vader - 01/27/94
A fun and entertaining elimination tag match here. It was great seeing Flair team up with a man who he put on the map not too many years ago, Sting, an Icon in the making. I also enjoyed seeing Sting and Vader go at it because they had one of the best feuds in WCW.

DISC 3

Sting vs. `Nature Boy' Ric Flair - 06/23/94
Five months after they team up, they face off again. This time, it's a Title Unification match. If you saw their other Clash Of The Champions match that's on this set, you'll know to expect something great.

Steve Austin vs. Ricky Steamboat - 08/24/94
Great match by these two HOFers. It was a great ride from start to finish.

Hulk Hogan & `Macho Man' Randy Savage vs. `Nature Boy' Ric Flair & The Giant - 01/23/96
I started to watch this and tried to get through it because Macho Man's one of my all time favorites. But skipped it after a while. Hogan & Savage, in my opinion were not the team they once were when they were The Mega Powers in the WWF.

Medusa vs. Bull Nakano - 08/15/96

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Eddie Guerrero - 08/15/96
Clash of the Champions XXXIII - 15th August, 1996

Harlem Heat vs. The Steiner Brothers vs. Sting & Lex Luger - 08/15/96
One of the best Title matches on this set. Harlem Heat was comprised of Booker T & Stevie Ray who I believe are brothers in real life and two real life best friends in Luger & Sting. So this had the making of a great and entertaining tag team match for me. And after it was over, I felt I got just that.

Ultimo Dragon vs. Dean Malenko - 01/21/97
The Cruiserweight Division was the only division in WCW that I appreciated as they brought a lot to the organization and was one of the reasons I think WCW had the success that they did. I really love Dragon's work and I found this work in this match to be one of his best.

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match
Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero - 08/21/97
Long before they were main event stars and WOrld Champions in WWE, Jericho & Guerrero were a part of WCW's Cruiserweight division. Great match here by two men who should be on anyone's list of all time greats.

Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger vs. Scott Hall & `Macho Man' Randy Savage - 08/21/97

Blu Ray Exclusives:

Ric Flair and Barry Windham vs. Midnight Express - 12/07/88

Sting and Ricky `The Dragon' Steamboat vs. `Ravishing' Rick Rude and Steve Austin - 01/21/92
Another great tag match on this set. If only WWE could put the quality of tag matches on this set in their tag matches to bring that division back to where it once was.

Dustin Rhodes & Sting vs. Big Van Vader, Paul Orndorff and Barry Windham - 01/13/93
I liked it. But this set has better Sting matches in my opinion. WIthout knowing much about WCW's history, I cannot tell if this match could be replaced by something better. But if I had to bet, I'd say yes. However, this match was not bad by any means.

A great set. Worth the price.",1337990400,,5862,4.214669051878354
5062698,4,B0077PTWNM,"No real complaints except maybe wish there was a documentary and a few different matches but all in all I highly recommend it to any WCW fan.  I'm just happy Vince has decided to release this set wish he would do full releases with WCW PPV's like with Wrestlemania,Royal Rumble,Summer Slam etc..but still nice that he isn't forgetting the WCW fans.  Also a side note Best Buy has 2 bonus matches:Hollywood Hogan vs. Rick Flair 1996 and The Midnight Express vs. The Fanatics 1988.",1337731200,10,479,4.690476190476191
5062699,3,B0077PTWNM,"I'm a bit let down by the fact that there's no feature about the history of the Clash of the Champions for this. This is just a collections of matches and Dusty does a few wraparounds here and there. Clash of the Champions has an interesting history too. If I remember correctly, NWA/WCW wanted to run a PPV on the same day as one of the Wrestlemanias but Vince pulled some weight and said that if any service provider aired another wrestling PPV, he would no longer provide content for them so NWA/WCW couldn't do a PPV but they then did the Clash of the Champions on basic cable for free to counter program the Wrestlemania that year. Then they used this to counter the other big WWF PPVs at the time. Unfortunately, nothing like that is in here. It's just a collection of matches and most of them are probably on youtube by now but with the original music and commentary that I'm guessing they pulled out because there's quite a few gaps in between Tony Schvione's(sp?)commentary.",1337731200,4,983,4.52808988764045
