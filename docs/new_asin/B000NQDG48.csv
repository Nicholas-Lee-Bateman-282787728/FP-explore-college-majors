8180620,1,B000NQDG48,"This movie has to be one of the most painfully pretentious pieces of pseudo art I've ever had the dis-pleasure of wasting my time watching.

The acting is atrocious across the board. It's painful to watch, really.

If you read the reviews here, you get the sinking feeling that they were all written by participants of this ""piece of art"".

Check it out: One of them was even written by director Tambay A. Obenson under his own Amazon account.

It almost would make you feel sorry, a grown man feeling the need to hype up his own failed work by writing a review about hi own movie... well he's a self declared film critic after all and writes for a bunch of blogs... how comes everybody writing for a blog is a journalist these days?

There are so many brilliant independent movies out there and even the lesser ones are still more rewarding to watch than this failed attempt at artistic film making.",1355356800,,900,4.4969325153374236
8180621,5,B000NQDG48,I loved this movie. At times I was shouting at the characters. I love that it was simple and really forgot that it was a movie cause it seemed so real. It really opened my eyes to look at relationships differently...Paulette,1201132800,,224,4.487804878048781
8180622,5,B000NQDG48,"I was asked to view this movie and I'm glad I did! I purchased the movie here on Amazon and it became the talk among my friends. Excellent acting and some very profound dialog between the couple in the movie. You see this in relationships, but rarely see this exchange in movies. The added short films were interesting as well. Invite some friends over and watch this movie. You'll hear some great opinions.

Please do more films showing relationships between people of African descent.",1198195200,,486,4.785714285714286
8180623,4,B000NQDG48,"I found the film ""Beautiful Things"" very interesting and very realistic.  I didn't know until I watched the director's commentary afterwards that these were actors!  They were very convincing.  The interview scenes throughout the film with the couple talking to someone who seemed to be some type of counselor or psychologist, effectively gives the impression that this is a real couple.

For aspiring filmmakers, I think the director's commentary gives a lot of insight into producing a short film and the decision-making process for making a film effective.  He said when he first showed the film that it didn't do well.  Later, he re-edited it, cutting out some scenes and filming some new ones.

I think one thing that could have worked better were the scenes where the actress was writing in her journal.  The writing appeared on the screen for several minutes, plenty of time to read it, but I would have preferred to have heard her voice whether she was reading it aloud or as though she was thinking to herself.  When I'm laying on the couch watching TV or a movie, sometimes I don't feel like sitting up to read a long passage.  That may be just me, but it's real.

This film would probably get a PG-13 rating if it were in the theaters.  There is a scene with some nudity and a few segments with some profanity.  Unfortunately, most of the online film reviews, (if someone has entered one), usually don't give any indication before someone chooses to buy a product. This is a real consideration for many people.",1198195200,,1521,4.715909090909091
8180624,4,B000NQDG48,"At that Black Man Film Festival in Atlanta, 2006, this movie was billed as a documentary - it isn't, but that's how real it feels.

It's an involving tale of two people trying to make sense of their lives and, whilst struggling with fledgling creative careers, trying to find validation through their relationship with each other, as so many of us tend to do.

It's interesting and well observed how the female lead, Schola, needs more and more from her relationship as her world outside of it fails to offer her the validation she craves - as an actress, as a black woman, as a success... While the male lead, Gabe, gradually extricates himself emotionally from the relationship in order to focus and try to make strides in his elusive film-making career. What they end up with is a strained sexual relationship and a gradual refusal of the very thing they both sought of each other in the beginning of their relationship - affection, admiration, adulation... Affirmation.

It's refreshing to see black actors in roles that don't require playing ""up"" being black. The characters are not overly funny, overly cool, overly rhythmic, overly ""black..."" They're simply human, with all the beauty and flaws that being human entails.

It's also a refreshingly realistic look at love and its pitfalls and, like the director's use of New York as a backdrop, does not rely on glossy images and hackneyed ideas of romance and idealism where everything inevitably ends up happily ever after.

Instead, ""Beautiful Things"" reflects the anxieties, the joys, the fears, and the uncertainties that we generally encounter in our romantic liaisons and is a perfect example of art imitating life - to the extent that, despite it's nave beauty, it makes you forget that it's art at all.",1177200000,3,1766,4.912751677852349
8180625,3,B000NQDG48,"Hopes, dreams and love are one's desires, yet pose life's struggles. Centering on two characters- Scola, an aspiring actress and Gabe, an aspiring film maker, the film portrays the two as free spirited individuals in the beginning and takes on the search for meaning when one encounters the other and develops a relationship. In the end, they fall into the point of self evaluating or defining one's desires or redirecting from original desires. The struggle is inherent- reality versus the dream. The color scenes are a bit too raw, but ask the questions of life or what's next? It is the poetic black and white imagery in BEAUTIFUL THINGS that are the more powerful accounts, capturing moments of original desires.",1176163200,,716,4.975
8180626,4,B000NQDG48,"Most films are variations of the ""Boy meets girl, boy struggles with girl and boy eventually wins back girl"" theme, but, few exist as imaginative and stylish as Beautiful Things. In his feature film debut, 33-year-old Writer/Director, Tambay Obenson has crafted a sophisticated, art-house variation on this subject. With alternating Black/White vignettes and color scenes, Beautiful Things is at once a play about relationships and a film which proves that to love is indeed, an act of the will-",1173312000,,495,5.2784810126582276
8180627,4,B000NQDG48,"Beyond the black and white, this is a quiet, absorbing tale about 2 people who meet and fall in love. The excitement of first contact is eventually transformed into the boredom of familiarity. The characters have to dig down really deep into their souls- each has to decide for themselves if the relationship is worth saving. And in a sense perhaps they can then figure out what true love may be all about. Love as intangible as it might be, is the real star of this movie.",1173225600,,473,4.448275862068965
8180628,5,B000NQDG48,"With its judicious use of black and white, New York, and a cool jazz score, this at times puts me in mind of early John Cassavetes and, with it's improv/unscripted feel, it's like you're actually privy to the intimate details of a real young couple's relationship - from its fledgling flirty stage, through its angst ridden, flailing progress, to its uncertain demise...

Despite the odd Spike Lee reference too many (really not the best way to get a girl to have sex), this is an absolute gem of a movie!",1173139200,3,505,4.611111111111111
8180629,5,B000NQDG48,"If you are like me and think that indie movies are not your thing then, this is the movie that will convince you to think otherwise. Once again, this is Tambay Obenson at his finest.  The two main characters-Gabe and Schola show such raw emotion that any viewer of this movie is bound to stay to the end of the movie and afterwards REALLY question the reality of ones' own relationships. For you guys out there, this is NOT a girlie movie but for you gals, it seems like it is.",1173052800,,477,4.241758241758242
