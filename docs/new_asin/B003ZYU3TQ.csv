4237183,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"A brilliantly told parable - a one of a kind film. The aspect ratio listed for the film (IMDB) is 1.66:1, which is the Criterion ratio. The film is sometimes listed as 1.37:1 which has to do with the optical sound track. It appears a shade larger on TV than on the previously released disk.
  I am not a fan of the overpriced Criterion transfers although their extras are sometimes worth the additional money. Their Tunes of Glory release, for example, has a remarkable green line which appears in the middle of a crucial scene and dances around for quite some time before vanishing. Criterion never saw fit to mention this anywhere and even dealers initially thought it was a fault in the disk rather than in the transfer. As a result I am leery of the Criterion releases (and their ""no tell"" policy). The extras on this film may alone be worth the steep price Criterion is known for.
  Some people have held that older films may look worse on Blu Ray because imperfections become more obvious, but with this film it will be hard to tell until we see it.",1289347200,,1055,4.479166666666667
4237184,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"Even back in the day before I learned to appreciate black and white films, this one unnerved me. One reviewer on here spoke of the indelible images of this film- and the one that always stuck with me is the woman in the water at the bottom of the lake, her hair billowing out around her. Robert Mitchum is sinister personified, and the scene where he is calling the children, and walking slowly towards the house while the camera becomes a peephole zooming in on a basement window while the children peer out is as frightening in its implications as anything made today. The tattoos on his hand- the infamous ""love"" and ""hate""- are the most enduring, and often when i mention this movie that is the one detail that everyone carries away with them. Absolutely essential viewing, creepy, almost like a demented fairy tale. Perfection.",1287878400,2,832,4.705479452054795

4237186,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"I have long hoped that Criterion would get their hands on this film. I believe NIGHT OF THE HUNTER to be arguably the greatest film of the 1950s and, also arguably, one of the top 100 films of the sound era. I first saw this movie when I was about 13; it was shown on WNEW out of NYC and all chopped up by commercials. Even so, the film scared and impressed me. The film still holds me as an adult, and my wife and I make an annual ritual of watching it. Adulthood is possible the best vantage point to appreciate this film. Although children are held by the POV and the scary parts, adults can engage with the symbolism, the beautiful photography, the sublime performances (and the scary parts); plus, as an adult, I always well up with tears when Lillian Gish shows up. Of course, the only available DVD has been the stripped down MGM version, so the tought of having NIGHT revamped, cleaned up, and nestled with all those great sounding Criterion extras is a thrill.",1284422400,10,969,4.388888888888889

4237189,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"The best kind of horror comes not from monsters or ghosts, but from other human beings. ""Cape Fear,"" ""Heavenly Creatures,"" and other such movies are brilliant examples of this.

But one of the most compelling examples is ""Night of the Hunter,"" a haunting movie that slowly descends into an exquisitely-filmed, brilliantly-acted nightmare about a malign preacher and the two children who are trying to escape. Like an old fairy tale, it's full of terror, magic, beauty and darkness.

Murderous preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is arrested for car theft, since the police don't know that his hatred of women has led him to repeated murder. He shares a prison cell with bank robber Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who stole ten thousand dollars. Powell tries to coax the location of the money from Harper, but the thief takes it to his grave. Only his son John (Billy Chapin) knows its location.

Upon his release, Powell arrives in Harper's town, claiming that he wants to ""bring this small comfort to [Ben's] loved ones."" Everyone is taken in by him, including his new wife -- Ben's gullible widow, Willa (Shelley Winters). When she vanishes, John and his little sister Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) must escape their evil stepfather -- even though he's determined to hunt them down and find the money.

When it was first released, ""Night of the Hunter"" flopped completely. Not very surprising -- the 1950s audiences weren't ready for the unconventional villains, rich symbolism, or the fact that an actor had dared to stray into a director's chair. Fortunately, it lived on as a cult film, and is now regarded as a classic.

It's especially sad that Laughton never directed again, because this is simply astonishing. It feels like a fairy tale, with Powell as the wicked witch, and the children as the protected innocents who are helped by a ""fairy godmother."" Laughton also loads it down with sexual and religious symbolism -- the LOVE and HATE tattoos, the switchblade, the eerie sacrifice scene.

Best of all is the cinematography. Beauty and horror are inextricably tied together: the dead Willa with ""her hair waving soft and lazy like meadow grass under flood water,"" or the little river animals watching the children escape under a starlit sky. But there are also moments of pure terror, such as the preacher's shadow falling over the kids, or calling out as they're hiding, ""I'm out of patience, children. I'm coming to find you now...""

Robert Mitchum played another evil stalker several years later in the superb ""Cape Fear,"" but this performance is even better. His Powell is a seething mass of murderous fervour and sexual hatred -- his intense eyes are enough to give you goosebumps. He's also backed by some excellent performances -- Chapin is amazing as the little boy determined to obey his father and somehow stop Powell. Bruce and Winters turn in some solid performances, and veteran Lillian Gish has a good supporting role as the kindly Rachel.

And at long last, this movie is getting the Criterion treatment! It's getting a cleaned-up, high-def digital transfer, audio commentary with the assistant director and some film experts, interviews with a Charles Laughton expert and the cinematographer, a trailer, a movie-length collection of archival material, a documentary with the producer and some other experts, sketches by Davis Grubb, and TV episodes centering on the movie. Plus, y'know, the required essay booklet.

As chilling and compelling as when it was first released, ""Night of the Hunter"" is a vibrant, primal experience, and nobody has quite come close to what it portrays.",1282435200,76,3603,5.02177554438861
4237190,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"The Night of the Hunter is a horrifying disturbing thriller, a film noir at its best. A film noir is a movie filled with a mood of pessimism, fatalism, cynicism, and menace. It was a term applied to some American thrillers and detective films. It was frequently filmed in dark shadows; hence the French term ""noir,"" meaning black. It was very popular from the early 1940s to the late 1950s.
Robert Mitchum is at his best and Charles Laughton who directed the film and the others involved did a perfect job. Mitchum played very well in other film noir. Laughton was superb as an actor; this was his only director job.
Mitchum plays a crazed religious fanatic who speaks with God, or so he thinks, and he is a serial killer, car thief, and liar. He has HATE on the knuckles of one hand and LOVE on the other, and insists that LOVE can overpower HATE, but the opposite is true. While in prison for car theft, he overhears a man talking in his sleep about having $10,000, a huge sum in 1955 when the film was made. The man was executed for murder. As usual, Mitchum plays his part with understated emotion, which adds to the horror.
When he is released from prison, Mitchum goes to the town to find the $10,000. He knows that the executed mans son and daughter know where the money is hidden. He marries the widow, brainwashes her, and refuses to have sex with her. He terrifies the children attempting to get them to reveal the hiding funds.

4237196,3,B003ZYU3TQ,"Warning: Spoilers ahead.

This movie held together pretty well during the first hour.  But the last half hour it lost focus and even got silly.  When Powell (Mitchum) came around the first time to the orphan house and pulled a knife, he was warned off at gun point.  However, he clearly warns that he will be back that night.  But does the woman call the police?  No.  She calls later, but only after having to shoot him (or at him, anyway).  Religiously speaking, I'm not sure what to make of this movie.  As a non-believer I think it showed religious hypocrisy and foolishness.  There were some good people in the movie, but to say they were good because of religion is to say that without it they would have been the opposite.  And that sounds wrong to me.  In the end, everyone in this movie talking to God is really just talking to themselves.  One of the most honest lines in the entire film -- regarding the human condition -- came when Mitchum's character was asked what religion he professes.  His response: ""The religion the Almighty worked out betwixt us.""  Exactly.  That's what everyone does even if they don't admit it.  Pick, choose and rationalize.  I'm curious to find out more about this movie (how it was intended to come across) and there's still some extras I need to watch.

The Night of the Hunter is a great example of a film that convincingly accomplishes that difficult balance between accessibility and substance. This is a wonderfully entertaining movie that is exceedingly well-paced, but is also a film with considerable thematic depth that urges you think as much as it makes you reach for that next handful of popcorn.

One of the things I really enjoyed about this movie is the very unique tone. The film is a mixture of so many different styles and moods: family melodrama, thriller, gothic horror, fairy-tale, surrealism and whimsy. Somehow all of these disparate elements come together in a surprisingly effective manner without ever feeling disjointed. The uniqueness of the film on this front alone makes it worth the watch.

This is also a fantastic film visually, with the lighting in particular being absolutely superb. This is definitely one of those movies that feels like it couldn't be anything other than black and white. The lighting is frequently harsh, angular, and jagged with bright whites and deep blacks intermingling. This makes for the perfect visual depiction of the themes of good and evil and their intermingled nature within all of us. The cinematography is also phenomenal with many instances of memorable and haunting imagery, particularly an extended shot at the bottom of a lake which is truly unsettling and chilling.

So yes, on a technical level this movie is excellent. But beyond that it's also an interesting and thought-provoking tale with plenty of substance. Harry Powell is a fantastically memorable villain and the perfect embodiment of the themes here. He's a walking contradiction - a pastor and a self-proclaimed man of God who is a self-interested opportunist and cold-blooded murderer seemingly lacking in any sense of morality. One of the things that makes him such an effective character is you never really fully understand what's going on in his mind. Is he mentally ill and having auditory hallucinations which he interprets as God commanding him to commit these acts? There is certainly a suggestion of that given his frank, out-loud conversations with God even when there is no one else around and he does give off the impression that he is speaking with someone who he actually hears. Or is he just a very intelligent criminal who has donned the guise of pastor in order to project a holy image that disarms people and makes them feel he is trustworthy? There is plenty of evidence for this as well, as he cunningly manipulates John and Pearl's mother and other folks around town.

The other characters in the film aren't quite as larger-than-life, but they too have nuance worthy of consideration. Especially interesting is the way that the adult characters in the film contrast with the children. Nearly every adult in the film is significantly flawed and represents that ""duality of man"" theme. John's ""uncle"" seems like a nice guy that has taken a liking to John as a sort-of mentor but is an alcoholic who fails to help when John and his sister are in danger. John's mother cares for him and Pearl, but selfishly marries Powell due to her attraction for him without considering what is really best for them. John's father murders two people to rob a bank, but does so for righteous reasons to help homeless and starving children (an action which, interestingly, ends up setting in the motion the events which eventually put his own two children on the street and homeless). Each of the adult characters also seems to be blinded by Powell's superficial charm and are unable to see the malicious intent that is right in front of their faces.

The children however, particularly John, are shown in a very different light. John immediately dislikes Powell and sees right through him from the start. He also has a strong moral compass, as he keeps his father's secret and protects his sister who is too young yet to understand what is really going on with Powell. John is seemingly at that magic age of idealism where he has a clear sense of right and wrong. He is old enough to be attuned to his surroundings and the intentions of others, but he hasn't grown up enough to be corrupted by the evil in the world.

Luckily, John and Pearl end up in the hands of Rachel Cooper, a grandmotherly figure who becomes their guardian. She really is the beacon of light among the adult characters in the film. She's definitely strict, but extremely strong-willed and protective of her foster kids. She seems to recognize the extreme value of children at John's idealistic age and the importance of a nurturing parent who can develop those characteristics into adulthood. Interestingly, she is also a religious women and acts as a direct foil to Powell's character. Although the film definitely implicates the corrupting power of religion and how many use it to justify their own perverse actions, Cooper's character is the other side of that coin. She has incorporated religion into her life and uses it as a motivation to take in foster children and care for them in their time of need. In light of this, the condemnation of religion that might seem obvious at the beginning of the film shifts into more ambiguous territory which is to the film's advantage.

All in all, The Night of the Hunter is one of those films that mixes high and low art to fantastic effect. It's well-paced, twisty, entertaining and accessible, but also offers plenty of substance, symbolism and thematic heft for the more discerning viewer. This is definitely a movie worth rewatching many times and I anticipate it will only grow on me.",1461110400,,5626,4.896117523609654
4237202,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"Leaning...Leaning....

A single image of a preacher, with his hands upon the post of a railing, knuckles spelling out the word L-O-V-E.

It's one of the most iconic images of all time.  I have seen it throughout my life.  I have seen it parodied in many films.  Yet, I have never known the source of this image until I recently asked my fellow film enthusiasts about it.

After all these years, I finally had the opportunity to watch the film from which that iconic image came from.

Wow!  NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is one of the finest films I have ever seen.  To think, for its time, what an incredible revelation this was to movie audiences.  It is so expertly directed, so cunningly photographed, and so ahead of its time that's it's mesmerizing to watch even today.  Most of all, the film has lost none of its effect more than 60 years later.  It is as creepy and haunting to watch today as it must have been back then.  I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film.  It's very rare that I get chills from a horror movie ---  but this story was so masterfully told that it builds up hair-raising suspense.

Robert Mitchum is incredible to watch. He's the ultimate bogey man for the ages -- a homicidal preacher who stalks two children in hopes of learning their darkest secret.  The story unfolds like a Brothers Grimm fairy tale.  Between its horror, there are moments of fantasy that are quite captivating to watch.  Director Charles Laughton should be praised for his imaginative approach to the film's narrative.

The Blu-ray transfer is faultless.  Shot in Black and White to enhance its impact, the images look astounding.  Most of all, there is plenty of film grain present.  This is another stellar release from Criterion.

After doing some research, I am very surprised the film did badly upon its release in 1955 and that Laughton never directed anything since.  I think NIGHT OF THE HUNTER was way ahead of its time, though most of it was rooted in the imagery of the silent years of cinema.  It seems to me that most of the appreciation for this film came decades after its release.

This is certainly one of the finest films ever made.  I was completely blown away by my viewing this morning.  I think I will be watching this movie many times over in my remaining lifetime.

""The Night of The Hunter"" is a fantastic film, chock for a atmosphere, chills, thrills and one of Robert Mitchum's greatest performances as psychopathic preacher Reverend Harry Powell. As the film opens we see a group of children playing hide and seek when one of the kid's stumbles upon a woman's body shoved into a cellar. We then meet the murderer, the ""Reverend"", as he's talking to God, already on the lookout for his next victim, targeting young widows. The ""Reverend"" spends some time in the local jail for car theft, and his cell mate happens to be a young man about to hung for the murder of two bank clerks that he shot in the middle of robbery. The Reverend soon learns that the man made off with $10,000 from the robbery, and that he's left a young wife behind, and two children, and the killer now knows who his next victim will be.

There is so much to enjoy about this film, from the stark black and white photography, lit and shot for maximum atmosphere, to the haunting soundtrack. But honestly, this movie is worth the price of admission for Robert Mitchum. The menace just drips off the screen making Harry Powell one of the greatest villains in movie history.

The Night of the Hunter incredibly, was the only film the great actor Charles Laughton ever directed and is truly a standalone masterwork. A horror movie with qualities of a Grimm fairy tale, it stars a sublimely sinister Robert Mitchum [Cape Fear and The Friends of Eddie Coyle] as a traveling preacher named Harry Powell (he of the tattooed knuckles), whose nefarious motives for marrying a fragile widow, played by Shelley Winters [A Place in the Sun and The Diary of Anne Frank] are uncovered by her terrified young children. Graced by images of eerie beauty and a sneaky sense of humour, this ethereal, expressionistic American classic also featuring the contributions of actress Lillian Gish [Intolerance and Duel in the Sun] and writer James Agee, is cinema's quirkiest rendering of the battle between good and evil.

FILM FACT: The film was a collaboration of Charles Laughton and screenwriter James Agee. Charles Laughton drew on the harsh, angular look of German expressionist films of the 1920s. The film's score, composed and arranged by Walter Schumann in close association with Charles Laughton, features a combination of nostalgic and expressionistic orchestral passages. The film has two original songs by Walter Schumann, ""Lullaby"" (sung by Kitty White, whom Walter Schumann discovered in a nightclub) and ""Pretty Fly"" (originally sung by Sally Jane Bruce as Pearl, but later dubbed by an actress named Betty Benson). A recurring musical device involves the preacher making his presence known by singing the traditional hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."" Robert Mitchum also recorded the soundtrack version of the hymn.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Night of the Hunter is a cinematic curiosity. Shot in black-and-white, the 1955 film is Charles Laughton's sole directorial effort. It starred Robert Mitchum, Lillian Gish, and Shelley Winters; James Agee wrote the screenplay (or is at least credited with doing so). Based on Donald Grubb's 1953 bestselling novel, it is a dark and powerful morality play. Not a great success when first released, it is now an acknowledged masterpiece.

It is a tale of good and evil, innocence and sin. The good, especially Rachel Cooper can seem too good to be true, but the evil, in the person the preacher, is as roundly, soundly evil as it gets. Good triumphs, but the damage done along the way is spectacular. The film is remarkable in a number of respects, not least of which is its acknowledgement of pure evil (and that in the guise of a man of god). Robert Mitchum's portrayal is particularly noteworthy, while Lillian Gish is also a perfect ""benevolent antidote to Preacher's evil.""

In his own words, director Charles Laughton described The Night of the Hunter [1955] as ""a nightmarish sort of Mother Goose tale."" Based on a popular novel by David Grubb, the film takes place in West Virginia during the Depression and follows a homicidal preacher as he stalks two children, a brother and sister, across the rural landscape. The reason for his pursuit is $10,000 in cash and it's stuffed inside a doll the little girl is carrying.

Charles Laughton worked with James Agee on the screenplay but the famous author of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men had a severe drinking problem (he died the same year) and the screenplay he delivered was a mammoth script by Hollywood standards that Laughton had to whittle down to an acceptable length. Although Agee biographer Lawrence Bergman maintained that Charles Laughton had to rewrite most of screenplay, the discovery of James Agee's first draft of the script in 2004 proved that it reflected Laughton's final release version, almost scene for scene.

The casting was also exceptional and Laughton coaxed excellent performances from Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, and Lillian Gish. However, he developed an aversion to the two child actors and when he overheard the little boy, Billy Chapin, bragged about winning the New York Critics' Circle Prize for a recent play, Charles Laughton roared, ""Get that child away from me."" After that, the two children took their direction mostly from Robert Mitchum. The only other problem Charles Laughton encountered was having to juggle his shooting schedule so that Robert Mitchum could begin work on his next film, Not as a Stranger [1955].

Ignored and misunderstood at the time of its release, except by a handful of critics, The Night of the Hunter had to wait several decades before it took its rightful place alongside other revered works of the American cinema. It was the sole directorial effort of actor Charles Laughton and he took the film's commercial failure very hard, abandoning any future plans to direct another film.

The Night of the Hunter is anything but a failure and is chock full of riches: Robert Mitchum creates a chilling portrait of evil in one of his finest performances (and one of his personal favourites); the rock-steady presence of Lillian Gish is both a homage and a direct link to the films of D.W. Griffith, who the film pioneer Charles Laughton pays a great tribute to this film genius. The shimmering beauty of Stanley Cortez's cinematography also recalls the shadows and lighting of other silent era classics by Fritz Lang and Josef von Sternberg, and the music score by Walter Schumann is unusually evocative, mixing hymns, children's songs, and orchestral effects. Unforgettably haunting images (a car submerged in a watery grave; a spider's web view of the children fleeing in a riverboat to the strains of Pretty Fly; a silhouetted angel of death) make this a perennially unsettling masterpiece from which modern chillers could learn much.

The Night of the Hunter is a complex film: arty, and yet as straightforwardly terrifying as any contemporary slasher film. It is a story of seductions, as well as the seduction of both evil and of good. It is a haunting film, and a memorable one. As others have pointed out, it was not an ideal debut for Charles Laughton, being too ambitious, trying too much. Audiences (and many critics) were apparently unsure of what to make of it. Though it received decent reviews, sadly it was not a commercial success. In Britain it was even rated with an X certificate (not as far-fetched as one might think: it is definitely a film for a mature audience). Each aspect of the films production, from the idyllic cinematography to the incredible performances, to the contrary uses of cinematic stylisation and narrative, presents an interplay of opposing ideas through a sophisticated, haunting, and strangely buoyant whole. It endures as an enchanting American folk tale ripe with intricate melodrama and mythic symbolism, one that no film fan will ever forget.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Presented in an aspect ratio of 1.66:1 and encoded with a stunning encoded 1080p transfer. Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of The Criterion Collection. This new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on a SCANTY film scanner from the original 35mm camera negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, and flicker were manually removed using MITTs DRS system and Pixel Farms PFClean system, while Digital Visions DVRN system was used for small grain, dirt and noise reduction. This is a very impressive high-definition transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There is only one audio track on this Blu-ray disc and that is a 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio and was taken from the UCLA Film & Television Archive restoration, supervised by Gitt and also by John Polito of Audio Mechanics. This restoration was painstakingly constructed from a 35mm composite master positive, a variable-density soundtrack negative of the films music and effects track, a projection print, and many rolls of 35mm magnetic film containing fully edited dialogue recordings. So in the end there was a  great deal of work was done to make sure that the audio presentation is as good as possible, and it clearly shows. The new 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio track conveys excellent depth and stability that will undoubtedly impress those of you who own the old inferior NTSC DVD release. The dialogue is also clean and stable and I did not detect any pops, cracks, hissings, or audio dropouts.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The Criterion Collection brings an amazing treasure trove of supplements for this Blu-ray edition of 'The Night of the Hunter.' Spanning two discs and mirroring its previous DVD release and most of the bonus material is being released for the first time on the home video market. For fans of this horror masterpiece, the collection is exceptional and worth the price of admission alone.

NEW and Restored high-definition digital transfer, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack.

The First Special Features and Extras Blu-ray Disc:

Audio Commentary: Commentary Recorded in 2008 and the commentary features Second-unit Director Terry Sanders, Film Archivist Robert Gitt, Film Critic F.X. Feeney, and Preston Neal Jones: To listen to the commentary while viewing The Night of the Hunter, press the AUDIO key on your Blu-ray remote at any time: This is a very informative commentary, in which second-unit director Terry Sanders, film archivist Robert Gitt, film critic F.X. Feeney, and Preston Neal Jones, author of Heaven and Hell to Play With. A great deal of the conversation is, of course, on the history of the movie, Charles Laughton's direction, but the discussion also includes several comments on the film's initial reception, it's immense influence and rise to a cinematic treasure, how each participant came to discover it and some wonderful thoughts on the film's themes. This is a terrific commentary, worth listening for those with an interest in film history and about its reception and restoration, the film's message, and Charles Laughton's fascinating life and career, etc.

Special Feature Documentary: The Making of The Night of The Hunter [2010] [1080p] [4:3] [37:59] This documentary traces the history of The Night of the Hunter, from Charles Laughton discovery of the Davis Grubb novel of the same title, and we also get to hear about the films poor reception in 1995 by the critics and the audience, but we also get to hear about its later ascension into the pantheon of classic films. This brilliant documentary features producer Paul Gregory, second-unit director Terry Sanders, and authors Preston Neal Jones, F.X. Feeney and Jeffrey Couchman. What we get over the period of the documentary is some really fascinating information, like Davis Grubb did some special pencil sketches of what he visualised how certain characters and scenes would appear in the film, and Charles Laughton was so bowled over, that he demanded Davis Grubb to send more drawings and Charles Laughton actually used them as the virtual storyboard. We also get to find out that the film took 35 days to shoot and came well under budget at $800,000, which is what they would spend on food and drink for the actors and crew today. The cost of getting the rights to the novel was $80,000. But the most fascinating interesting facts of the film, is that 99.9% the film was shot on the backlot of the RKO Studio. But what was sad to hear is that United Artist would not spend certain amounts of monies on publicity for the film, and the film at the time of its release was a complete flop and it made Charles Laughton totally depressed and crushed, but of course it has now become one of the Top 5 Classic Film. This is a must view documentary.

Special Feature Documentary: Simon Callow on Charles Laughton [2010] [1080p] [16:9] [10:35] In this interview, that was shot in 2010 in London. Simon Callow, the author of Charles Laughton: A Difficult Actor discusses Charles Laughtons career and the effects on this lone foray into film directing it had on his life. Simon Callow gives a totally engrossing talk about Charles Laughton and definitely shows how he loved this fascinating character and gives loads of praise on the talent of Charles Laughton and feels he could of gone onto greater things, especially going onto a brilliant film director, which sadly ended with The Night of the Hunter. This is again a must view documentary, as Simon Callow is a very charismatic person and it also shows how much he loved the film and that is why he produced his first class novel on Charles Laughton.

Special Feature Documentary: Moving Pictures [1995] [480i] [4:3] [14:18] This just under fifteen-minute special documentary on the classic film The Night of the Hunter is presented by Howard Schuman, which was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two channel, on 19th February, 1995 and features interviews with producer Paul Gregory, actors Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and Lilian Gish [1978], editor Robert Golden, art director Stanley Cortez, and second-unit director Terry Sanders.

Special Feature: Clip from The Ed Sullivan Show [1995] [480i] [4:3] [3:51] In this short excerpt from the 25th September, 1995 episode of The Ed Sullivan Show, we get to see the actors Peter Graves and Shelley Winters perform a scene not included in the film The Night of the Hunter, here we get to see Willa Hunter visits Ben Harper in prison. Sadly the quality of the video image is really rough, as is the sound and it looks like it was recorded off someones home VHS video recorder.

Special Feature: Archival interview with Cinematographer Stanley Cortez A.S.C. [1984] [480i] [4:3] [12:53] In this July 1948 interview, that was shot in Hollywood at the American Society of Cinematographers, where we get to see the Oscar winning Stanley Cortez being interviewed by Claude Ventura and Laurence Gavron about his work on the classic film The Night of the Hunter, and we hear his total respect for Charles Laughton the director and the way he respected all the actors and crew, and especially his Cinematographer Charles Cortez, as Charles Laughton knew he would get the best cinematography for his film with light and shade. Because it was filmed by a French Television crew, you unfortunately get French subtitles appearing on the screen.

Special feature: Gallery of Sketches by Author Davis Grubb: To navigate this sequence, press the right arrow on your Blu-ray remote to move forward the images and with the left key arrow to move backward to the previous images. To exit, your press ENTER. Here we get to see all of the pencil sketches that Davis Grubb sent to Charles Laughton, which was used as the virtual storyboard for the film. You also sometimes get to see the actual black-and-white images that relates to the pencil sketches.

Theatrical Trailer [1955] [1080p] [1.66:1] [1:36] This is the Original British Theatrical Trailer, as you get the British Board of Film Censors logo advertising an X Certificate Film for a U Trailer.

The Second Special Features and Extras Blu-ray Disc:

Special Feature Introduction: In this conversation, recorded specially for The Criterion Collection in 2010, here you have film archivist Robert Gitt and film critic Leonard Maltin discuss the discovery and preservation of the material used to make Charles Laughton Directs The Night of the Hunter [2010] [1080p] [16:9] [16:58] This is a really fascinating interview and we hear lots of anecdotes on how this preservation work came to fruition. Robert Gitt had felt he had been on this project from 1959, especially after viewing the film broadcast on his television and not realising it was directed by Charles Laughton. Eventually he met Elsa Lancaster, who informed him of 18 boxes of all the rushes and outtakes of the film. Over the next 20 years Robert Gitt painstakingly edits all of the rolls of film of the rushes and outtakes to produce this special presentation that follows this interesting interview. But one big problem Robert Gitt had when everything had been edited together in 2001; he found that he had over 8 hours of film, if shown in one session. But eventually Robert Gitt had to edit the rushes and outtake down to a manageable 2 hours 39 minutes to give it a brilliant presentation, which you are about to see after this interview. What you get to view is a full 4:3 frame presentation, which gives you an insight into Charles Laughtons frame of mind in producing this classic film.

Special feature: Charles Laughton Directs The Night of the Hunter [2002] [1080p] [4:3] [2:39:05] Here you get to see a treasure trove of outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage. It was The Epic That Was and seeing Charles Laughton in person directing all the actors is a glorious treat to view and it was a tragedy he was not allowed to direct more films, as he would have made some stunning films, as he was a true professional in his outlook towards presenting good classic films. But sadly The Night of the Hunter was a total disaster at the time of its release and Charles Laughton was totally devastated why it was not a success or won any Academy Awards. But of course this film has now gone into the annals of a classic film, that The Criterion Collection has now produced a beautiful stunning presentation. Anyway this special presentation of the outtakes and rushes is totally fascinating and gives a much better insight into this beautiful magical classic film.

BONUS: Here we have a stunning 30 page Special illustrated booklet containing Terrence Rafferty's essay ""Holy Terror"" (the author teaches at Princeton University) and Michael Sragow's essay ""Downriver and Heavenward with James Agee.""

Finally, Despite being a box-office and critical failure during its initial theatrical release, 'The Night of the Hunter' has since become widely recognised as one of the most beautifully photographed and remarkable films in cinema history. I think it is fair to say that the wait was well worth it. Indeed, The Night of the Hunter looks totally spectacular on Blu-ray, and the supplemental features Criterion have provided are simply outstanding. This is a true American classic, folks, which has received the type of treatment it so rightfully deserves. A special thanks to UCLA Film & Television Archive for making this release possible. Very Highly Recommended!

A woman warns children: beware of false prophets. Children playing see a body in a barn. A man in an open top car drives down a road. [A rear projection screen.] He attends a theater, but is caught for being a car thief. Elsewhere a man brings money to his son, the police are after him! Ben Harper will be hanged for a double murder. [This is set in the Great Depression of the 1930s.] Ben never talked. A prison guard looks after his family. His children are teased at school. We see a steam locomotive. A stranger is in town, he lives in the boarding house. Harry Powell tells a story about Hate and Love. He was a friend to Ben, he says. There is a picnic, Harry pumps Mrs. Harper for information. Powell tells John about the marriage. Will Pearl spill the beans? Harry talks to his wife about personal matters.

Pearl cuts up pieces of paper, she doesnt know what it is. Willow made a mistake in a hasty marriage to a stranger. Then we learn that Willow has run away with a traveling salesman! [Who will repot this to the police?] Powell has a good story for her disappearance. Will Uncle Bertie tell what he saw? Harry questions Pearl and John about that money. John says its in the cellar under a stone. But Pearl tells where it is! They run out of the house and go to Uncle Bertie. Hes no help. The children leave in a boat and paddle down river. They seek shelter in a cow barn for the night. [No dogs to warn against strangers?] Powell is on their trail. [Those backgrounds seel like a back lot.] They find a home with Miss Cooper. The Bible provides low-cost entertainment for her children. The Preacher finds Ruby and treats her to ice cream while he asks questions.

Ruby tells Miss Cooper about this. Powell shows up to ask about John and Pearl. He aint my Dad. A good woman with a gun stops a bad guy. Harry returns after dark and sings. A shot drives him off.

The police take this man out the back way to prison. Miss Cooper and the children celebrate Christmas. Johns present is a watch.

Was this meant as a horror film? A warning against strangers who put on an act to impress the people they meet? This isn't much of a story, parts seem implausible except as needed for this story. Beware of friendly strangers who try to sell you something is still good advice. Just watch the advertising on TV for examples. Trust no one.

A fable that is greatly inspired by the seminal silent films of the early master D.W. Griffith, The Night Of The Hunter is a visual goldmine. Robert Mitchum is absolutely perfect, dreamlike even, at his most vicious and purely evil. Instinctual like a rabid beast and sinister as the devil. All of the photography is startlingly well captured and presented. An amazing achievement from a first time director. Most of all, it is a loving homage to D.W. Griffith. Laughton successfully uses the language of the silent film era as his primary mode of communication. To astonishing results, the silent film language catapults the power of the film into the ethereal. An amazing, one of a kind experience. A magnum opus of sight and light and might.

4237254,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"The Night of the Hunter stands out as one of the most chilling films ever drawn from the power of old time religion,good vs. evil,light vs.darkness,innocence vs. experience. Laughton that great film actor showed what he could do directing. Robert Mitchum showed how menacing he could be in Cape Fear,here it's to the power of ten as told from the child's perspective. With Mitchum's presence we get a sense of palpable dread,a sense of growing evil and malevolence,the closing in of shadows,the warping of religion like the tearing of fabric in the night,the persecution and the dwindling hope of goodness on the run. Godliness gone wrong.

This is a poetic,visionary classic of Southern gothic,graced with Mitchum's finest performance as preacher Harry Powell,at once sinister,charming and slyly comic. Hunter channels the silent cinema of Murnau and DW Griffiths. This link is made by the casting of Griffith's favourite actress,Lillian Gish,as the fairy godmother with whom the children,fleeing from Powell,find refuge. Two nocturnal scenes,in a film of expressionistic shadows,encapsulate the haunted fairytale mood. As the children drift down the river,they're watched from the banks by animals seen in huge close-up,like tutelary spirits. And when Gish guarding the house,her shotgun across her lap,starts singing `Leaning on the everlasting arms', the preacher prowling outside in the dark,joins in-good and evil in deceptive harmony.

Cahiers du Cinema, recently voted it the second ""most beautiful"" movie ever made, just behind Citizen Kane. Laughton worked closely with man-about-town writer (and godfather of popular film criticism) James Agee to transpose Davis Grubb's fevered, Southern pulp thriller into a lucid, poetic, terrifying work of pure intuition. Laughton and Agee's adaptation zeroed in on the novel's Faulkner-meets-Brothers Grimm overtones and maximized the tonal contradictions. Few moments in movie history are as shockingly bold, and simultaneously ethereal, as the moment the newly orphaned John and Pearl narrowly escape Powell's slashing knife and float down the river on a skiff. In the space of 15 seconds, the movie transitions between a moment of pure horror--capped by Mitchum's hellish bellow of frustration--into a slow, starry-skied journey into an American pastoral twilight, capped by a seemingly diegetic musical number about a ""pretty fly"" sung spontaneously by Pearl. Due to its poor reception,
Laughton never directed again,on this evidence a major loss.",1385769600,,2501,5.63129973474801

THIS IS A SPOILER ALERT

In the scene's climax, the preacher attacks the children's foster mother in an effort to kidnap them. He announces after he can't get in that he will return that night. The woman doesn't call the police. However, when she chases him that night into her barn, she then calls the police. Why didn't she do it before???

4237258,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"Had I stayed in grad school,  I likely would have wound up writing a dissertation on German Expressionist drama, specifically on the playwright Georg Kaiser.  So I can't help but find it amusing--in a self-deprecating sort of way--that I totally missed the Expressionist connection the first time I saw the Charles Laughton classic THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER a few years back.  I guess I just didn't expect to bump up against exemplars of what seemed to me to be a uniquely European artistic movement in a 1950s American movie.  Come to think of it, I never quite got the Expressionist influence in Douglas Sirk films either.

Kinda makes you want to go back to Square 1--or Lit History 101.  Maybe it was all to the good that I dropped out of grad school after all.

But it IS interesting that some of the few examples of cinematic Expressionism in American cinema are linked to European born directors.  The German born (of Danish parents though) Sirk certainly had more obviously direct roots to the tradition than Charles Laughton might at first appear to have had.  But it is helpful to know that Laughton had worked with Bertolt Brecht (who--if not Expressionist himself--is linked to the movement) and that his theater work overall would have given him substantial exposure to this most unscholastic of Schools.

On subsequent viewings--and with a bit more understanding of the film's underpinnings--I found it made a lot more sense.  At least as much sense as a child's nightmare can make.  If ""Expressionism"" strikes a potential viewer as too arty and off-putting a term, perhaps the film's noted ""fairy tale"" quality might make it more appealing.  Or its clear roots in the more well known and accepted horror genre. However you slice it artistically, we're in the realm of the eerie, the primordial.  It's a good where good (in the form of Lilian Gish) and evil (Robert Mitchum) do exist and do battle.  But where moral ambiguity does exist, because the rest of the characters--the ones we viewers are meant to identify with--are all too human.

Cinemaphiles should definitely consider purchasing the Criterion Collection set, with its abundant special features.  While some may come away from viewing the extensive re-construction of outtakes that comprises Disc 2 a bit bleary eyed-- and with a sense that it's for the most hardened of film buffs only--others will find it fascinating and a rarely offered insight into the movie-making process.  Listening to Laughton give direction is fascinating, even when it makes you realize just how tedious, or even stultifying the experience can be.

Laughton's sole directorial effort was perhaps too bold or too unusual a statement to have ever caught on in a big way in 1954.  It's a shame that he never got a chance to direct another film and that this experience was so crushing for him.  We're fortunate to have the restored film, and all the outtakes and commentary.

4237262,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"There is a lot to say about this remarkable film. NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is a masterpiece that deserves to be in a category of its own - thriller, crime, suspense, drama comedy and there is even a bit of film noir in this classic.
As with many masterpieces, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER was misunderstood when it was first released. United Artists did not know how to market this film. What was this film, exactly? It was ahead of its time in many ways and only years later was it truly admired to become an American film classic.

As I said, there is a bit of everything in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. It's a crime story but then it become a suspense thriller and eventually it is a fantasy view of the world from the eyes of two young children. NIGHT OF THE HUNTER was film acting legend Charles Laughton's only film. It's poor reception was one of the big disappointments of his career. He never directed a film again.

The DVD cover of this Criterion Collection version has a film noir feel as we see Robert Mitchum holding a young girl as she looks up to him. I watched this film with no background to the story. Just the DVD cover and the fact that I was watching Robert Mitchum films and this one was on the list. Oddly, I have meant to watch this film for years simply because a long-time friend of mine is one of the children seen later in the film.

What an amazing cast. Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and the superb Lillian Gish and sprinkled throughout are well-known character actors of the era. There is a feel and ambiance to the film that I noticed right away. There is reverence to silent films in NIGHT OF THE HUNTERS. It was filmed in black and white for a reason. The indoor and nighttime scenes can be downright creepy and scary. The mood is set. It seemed strange to see Shelley Winters as a young actress--attractive but in a normal, girl next door sense. Her husband (a young Peter Graves) kills two men in a robbery and is eventually tried and executed. But what became of the $10,000 that was stolen. Enter the ""Preacher"" Harry Powell played with delight by Robert Mitchum bent on finding the missing money. He successfull woos the widow Willa Harper. Only her 10-year-old son John, played by the remarkably talented Billy Chapin, sees the preacher for what he is. A decade later, Winters was to again play a widow wooed by a nefarious con man in LOLITA. No one seems to be suspicious of a preacher with the words LOVE and HATE tattooed on the fingers of each hand.

The lighting sets the mood in so many scenes and that becomes more and more evident as the story progresses. At first, we have a somewhat straightforward story. Only when the children are on their own trying to evade the preacher do we have a shift in the story and the world is now seen through the eyes of two children. Truly remarkable and the shift is subtle. Eventually the kids are found by Rachel Cooper played by the lovely, charming, fantastic and one of a kind silent film star Lillian Gish. Gish lights up the screen and it's a shame that her film appearances were limited in the sound era.

We know from the beginning that the ""preacher"" is a widow killer so I am not giving anything away. One of the most shocking and memorable scenes I have ever seen is one of his victims in the water and her hair is flowing through the water along with the lake plants (much like ocean kelp). Watch the extras to find out how this scene was shot so realistically.

The absolute surprise in this film is the talented child actor Billy Chapin. Here was a 40-year-old trapped in the body of a child. From this movie alone, I would rank him as one of the best child actors I have ever seen but apparently, he only did one more film after this one. An incredible talent that must be seen. On the other hand, the actress playing his baby sister Pearl, Sally Jane Bruce, ranks as one of the most annoying child actors I have seen with a strange voice and an odd way of saying, ""John."" This was her one and only film appearance.

NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is stylish, quirly, off-beat and totally addictive to any fan of classic films. I spent a week watching all the extras on the Criterion Collection version and this version is a MUST to any film buff. Here is the odd story of how the film came to the big screen directed by Charles Laughton. There is a lot of praise to be given to the Criterion Collection version and all the extras.

Film buffs can't miss the 2 1/2 hour extra CHARLES LAUGHTON DIRECTS NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.
There is probably nothing like it in film history. Laughton keep the camera running when giving directions and beyond that he SAVED all the hours and hours of outtakes. His widow actress Elsa Lanchester finally donated the countless reels to archivists who spent years and years making sense of it all. The final product takes us as close to a film set and the movie making process that most of us will ever see. Here are the scenes in order as Laughton directs his cast--their mistakes, their triumphs and his direction on how to play the scene over and over. It is remarkable. I have never seen anything like it and it can't be missed.

Before writing this review, I wanted to have lunch with my friend to discuss her memories of the film. The story was that Laughton was not good with the child actors. The outtakes and my friend prove that was not the case. She said he was gentle and patient with the kids. Lillian Gish was wonderful and she had some great stories about Robert Mitchum and his antics--here was an actor who liked his drink and stayed out late and kept the cast and crew waiting for him to show up on set. I can't imagine what it must be like to be part of film history.

One final note. Mitchum sings throughout the film and I was amazed that he can actually carry a tune and he carries it quite well. I had heard he had a hit in the 1950's with the theme to his film THUNDER ROAD. I always figured that was a fluke but I was fascinated to learn there are three Robert Mitchum CDs on Amazon that you can buy. I got the one where Mitchum sings calupso and he pulls it off. Amazing. Some people have more than their share of talent.",1358208000,4,6144,4.339425587467363
4237263,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"Brilliant direction by Charles Laughton! Pity this was his only directorial attempt. Bad reviews shattered him.

4237264,3,B003ZYU3TQ,"The three stars is not for the film itself, it's for the transfer. It goes without saying that ""The Night Of The Hunter"" is a masterpiece and the greatest film ever made by a director who only directed once. Overall Criterion's restoration job looks O.K., a little grainy maybe but solid with good deep blacks. However, there's one critical scene, the one where the children are spending the night in the barn during their downriver journey and John wakens to see the preacher riding his horse across the horizon at the breaking dawn. In that scene, in the dawns light, the pixels are just jumping ( like sparklers on the 4th of July). Has anybody else noticed this?  I find it extremely distracting and it ruins this important (poetic) pause in the film.  I have a 2012 40 inch 1080p Sony Bravia. I also have the old MGM DVD along with the Criterion DVD AND BLU-RAY.  The MGM transfer while certainly (mostly) inferior does not have the jumping pixels in that scene, while the Criterion DVD and (even more so) BLU-RAY do.  However, all the rave reviews (including BLU-RAY.com) make no mention of this rather obvious flaw. I would be interested to read any comments.",1355443200,4,1166,4.673170731707317

4237272,2,B003ZYU3TQ,"NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is one of the most lauded films in cinema history.  Critics overwhelmingly love it (and not just here on Amazon).  True connoisseurs of fine films wouldn't dare say anything negative about it.  It's brilliant.  It's ground-breaking.  It's a perfect film.  Yada, yada, yada.

I understand what Charles Laughton was trying to do with NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.  I get the bow to German expressionism, the purposely stilted dialogue, the cardboard sets, the stylistic mise-en-scene.  And I do admire the cinematography, which is reminiscent of Wells's brilliant work on CITIZEN KANE and MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS.  There is one amazing scene of murdered Willa (Shelley Winters), shot through incandescent water, her hair floating all about her like seaweed, that is downright mesmerizing.

But as a movie - and by that I mean something worth watching for more than its artsy stylistics - NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is a failure.  The story itself is interesting, if one-dimensional - evil psycho-preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) pursues two innocent children who know where their dead father's stolen money is hidden.  He marries their widowed mother, Willa, just to get close to the kids.  He's over-the-top psychotic, but no one sees it - not Willa, not their friends, and not the little girl (who runs up to him with her arms wide even after he's physically threatened both her and her brother and chased them across the state).  In fact, no one in this film seems to do anything sensible.  No one investigates what really happened to Willa.  Mrs. Cooper (Lilian Gish), the grandmotherly woman who takes the kids in, never calls the police, not even when Powell is stalking the kids right in front of her house.  No, she just sits on the porch with a loaded shotgun, singing hymns with him.

Yes, I know this is what Laughton was going for.  The story wasn't supposed to make sense as a story.  It's a dream, a waking nightmare perhaps.  The hymn is important - it reflects the moral center of the story.  I get it.  And if I had to write an essay on the film for grad school I'd have an easy time of it.  But it's not watchable.  Powell staggers after the kids like Frankenstein's monster, and he shrieks like a banshee at one point, which is nothing short of laughable.  Worst of all, the religious moralizing (especially the excruciating final scene with Mrs. Cooper babbling biblically at the camera) is downright maudlin.

I do not consider this film to be the litmus test of a valid film lover (as many people here on Amazon seem to suggest).  It is worth seeing, if only for the cinematography (and those few really striking visual scenes).  But if you expect more than style, you'll be disappointed.  Comparing it to CITIZEN KANE is really unfair - CITIZEN KANE is admittedly a stylistic and beautifully filmed movie, but it also has a compelling story, believable characters, stunning acting, and a well-written screenplay.  NIGHT OF THE HUNTER has none of those things.

As part of cinema history, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is worth watching.  Just know what you're getting before you do so.  If you end up loving it, that's great.  But if you end up not liking it at all, that doesn't mean you're not as smart as those who do.

4237275,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"The Night of the Hunter is a movie that it's very different from what you've seen and perhaps you'll ever see. It is a horror film but has comedy, sexual undertones, religious themes, hypocrysy and more. Charles Laughton first and only directorial effort is truly a film that has to be seen to fully comprehend the magnitude of it.

Evil Preacher Harry Powell is a man that has done his living by marrying naive widows, killing them and stealing her money. He and the Lord (God) had a very peculiar relationship in which the preacher uses the name of him for his unlawful acts. When it comes to his knowledge that a robber sentenced to death hid the money with his family, the preacher sees this as another sign of the Lord to carry on with his mission. He arrives to a small town where he befriends the thief's widow and of course ends marrying her. While she does not suspect anything at all, her children, John and Pearl who knows where the money is do not trust the newcomer. After Harry disposes of Willa (the widow), he comes after the children to make them tell him where the money is. The children escape and here begins a chase down the river until the children arrives at the house of Rachel Cooper, a religious and good woman who shelter the children and defend them from the evil preacher.

Told like that, the story seems simple but many things enhance it and elevate the film to a classis status. Charles Laughton did a terrific job directing the film. From subtle references of silent films to beautiful shots to build atmosphere, his passion and love for his work can be feeled in every shot. Stanley's Cortez cinematography is simply breathtaking. The scenes in the river are beautifully shot and express the feeling of loneliness, danger and isolation that the children are experiencing at that moment. The cast is simply superb with Robert Mitchum giving a terrific performance as the evil preacher. Lillian Gish is also fantastic as the savior Rachel and the children are spectacular. The themes of the movie are profound and simple at the same time. Themes like the innocence of children, the evil of men, religion and more are what makes the movie so terrorific and magical at the same time, once you look at it, you can't look back. Of course the universal theme of good vs evil is maginificently played here. My favorite scene is when Mitchum is outside Gish's house in the night and both sing ""On the everlasting arms"", that scene simbolizes the fight between good and evil and only one can win. This picture is truly a timeless masterpiece.

Video & Audio
Being a Criterion release, you expect nothing but the best and fortunately Criterion continues its excellent work by giving The Night of the Hunter a terrific restoration. The image is clear and crisp, film grain is intact and whites and blacks are strong. Some minor artifacting pops from time to time but is nothing of concern. An amazing transfer through and through.

Likewise, the PCM monoaural track is amazing. The restoration clearly shows here because the audio is clear and crisp without any sign of hiss or distortion.

Bonus Features:
Criterion has put an incredible 2-disc BD set that is full of bonus goodies. On disc 1, aside from the movie you have a great audiocommentary by the crew of the film, 'The Making of The Night of the Hunter' a newly created documentary on the production of the film. A video interview with Laughton's biographer Simon Callow, A clip from the Ed Sullivan Show where Shelly Winters and Peter Graver perform a scene that is not included in the film, A 1995 making of documentary, A 1984 interview featuring cinematographer Stanley Cortez, A gallery of sketches by David Grubb and the theatrical trailer.

The contents on disc 1 is enough to give this set a 5 star rating but what's included in disc two will blew your mind away. The documentary ""Charles Laughton Directs: The Night of the Hunter"" is a terrific piece of film where you can see the making of the film in the exact moment. Assembled by Robert Gitt, this film features hours of rushes, outtakes and alternate scenes of the film. You can hear Laughton directing the actors and how every scene was approached. It makes you feel like you were in the production of the film. Is simply spectacular. This documentary is preceded by an enlightening introduction by Robert Gitt and Leonar Maltin.

Aside from this, this set comes with a booklet featuring two essays one by Terrence Rafferty and the other by Michael Sragow.

Closing Thoughts:
The Night of the Hunter is simply one of the best films ever made and deserves to be seen by everyone. Criterion has done a splendid job with this set giving the film a magnificent restoration and spectacular bonus features. This set is very highly recommended!!!",1312848000,13,4786,4.709677419354839
4237276,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"This dark American fairy tale was the only movie Charles Laughton ever directed, as it bombed at the box office. In the decades since its release, it's come to be acknowledged as a classic, its influence seen in such filmmakers as David Lynch and the Coen Brothers (the latter of which would be the only filmmakers I'd trust with a remake).

Robert Mitchum plays Harry Powell, a Depression-era itinerant faux-clergyman and serial killer who murders widows for their money (and because he gets off on doing so). While in jail for a car theft, he learns that his cellmate -- set to be hanged -- stole and successfully hid a big wad of cash somewhere on the outside. So Powell woos his cellmate's widow (Shelley Winters) while trying to ferret out the location of the money from the only two living people who know -- Winters's son and daughter. Powell fools everyone with his schtick except the boy. Soon there will come, as the Faulkneresque Davis Grubb novel the film's based on notes, ""a time of running.""

Mitchum's performance is singular and stellar -- he's a charming, creepy monster with a (real) tremendous singing voice. Billy Chapin, playing the 10-year-old boy, does lovely work as he defiantly opposes Powell while trying to keep his younger sister -- and the money -- safe. Their escape down the Ohio River, with Powell always somewhere close behind, is staged as an almost mythic journey.

Laughton uses a lot of silent and early sound film in-camera visual effects to achieve certain things (forced perspective being the most notable, but he also deploys the 'iris-in', a silent-film technique not much used since, oh, about 1929). The black-and-white cinematography glistens. The characters straddle the line between verisimilitude and allegory (or in the case of some supporting characters, caricature). And somewhere at the end of the line waits silent-film star Lillian Gish, embodying canny good. An odd, great film.",1310256000,2,1935,5.003105590062112
4237277,4,B003ZYU3TQ,"This is the 5th Criterion Blu-Ray release that I've seen after M (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray], Modern Times (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray], Stagecoach (The Criterion Collection) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBISY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] but it is an excellent film and the most unique of these.  This version firstly comes in a beautiful mostly cardboard digipak format with an excellent 28-page booklet containing a couple of great essays.  We get two discs here: one of the great film and the other full of special features.  I'm amazed relatively so few have heard of this film and I only came across this by accident myself.

The picture quality is good having been well restored and while it is not perfect as it is very grainy but if you are like me and if you watch it from the usual sofa distance the grain shouldn't really bother you although I grant that I can tolerate quite a lot of grain if it adds to the intention of the film which I believe it does here but I don't like other picture imperfections such as white and blacks spots and scratches etc which thankfully are not present here or at least not to this reviewer's eye; it is still very good to watch and one cannot overstate just how much better black and white films look on 1080p. The sound quality is also good although personally I would have liked to have had a DTS HD MA lossless 5.1 surround option but perhaps this mono is the best they could do.

Laughton was obviously influenced by D.W. Griffith in his direction as he actually learned how to direct this his one and only attempt at the craft by spending hours watching his films but he also introduced elements of Lang with regards German expressionism and I found myself enjoying this film a great deal even to the point of feeling that it was too short.  It reminded me of other films involving kids and their viewpoint and how they survive in the world of adults in which they have little if any control such as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and especially ""M"" where the mob scene in the courtroom at the end seems to be borrowed from.  In ""M"" the villain blames a mental disorder while here Mitchum claims God tells him to do his misdeeds.  Overall the theme appears similar in both films which is that innocent kids are to be protected and not exploited.  This film is certainly a scary one but for me the most scary aspect is just what people can get away with by perverting the spirit and intention of the words of scripture.

I loved how the film used opposites to show true bravery, courage and the willingness to do the right thing as represented by the kids and Gish's characters contrasted so sharply with the empty words and promises of the shopkeeper couple, the drunken uncle, the parents and of course the brilliantly evil Mitchum character as well.  The symbolism is also rife such as the children on the boat fleeing like on the river Styx out of hell and into the arms of the goodness of Gish.  When the children come to Gish's house we see a shadow of a bird in a cage representing a trustworthy ""birdie"" unlike the big failure and disappointing Uncle Birdee.  The adults from the kid's hometown are cowardly, untrustworthy and show little hope while the children show great courage, resourcefulness and are hopeful.  Mitchum's character knows the bible inside out just like Satan as shown in the story in the bible about Jesus' temptation in the desert where the devil recites scripture in order to tempt but Gish's character also recites scripture but applies it in the proper unperverted way and lives it as a way of life.  The true heroes are the kids who show a resilience and mental strength to overcome as well as Gish who has the courage to do the right thing while the other adults fail miserably.

Simply astounding and a must-have in any self-respecting movie fan's video library.

Highly recommended!",1304208000,10,4038,4.84593023255814
4237278,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"The Night of The Hunter is one of the great film noir stories. In some ways in bares a close resemblance to a fairy tale or horror tale. It is about an insane preacher who's pact with his god has him running around the states marrying widows and murdering them. This sets of a chase with two children who are the only two people who know where their father (Mitchum's cell mate) hid $10,000.

The Criterion Collection has outdone themselves yet again. While the picture transfer is a bit grainy at times, I'm sure it couldn't be helped and therefore is as good as it gets. The blacks are intense, the light is blinding. The picture was beautiful and still is, whether you have to thank the DoP or the transfer for that.

The special features on this set are very interesting and informative. They are in fact quite lengthy and detailed and shed some light on a film that leaves a few questions unanswered: why did Charles Laughton never make another film? Why are there the strange talking heads in the opening? All are answered within. Highly recommended, worth the seemingly steep price.",1302048000,4,1089,4.608247422680412
4237279,3,B003ZYU3TQ,"The late Charles Laughton still has a cadre of rabid fans who consider him the greatest of all film actors.  In fact, they never utter his name without including his full moniker: Charles F****** Laughton!  He electrified audiences with his portrayals of Captain Bligh and the Hunchback of Notre Dame among many other sterling portrayals.  Who can forget him as the droll judge in the film version of Agatha Christie's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION?

Although Laughton spent an inordinate amount of time and energy keeping his homosexuality secret, he adored his beloved companion and wife, fellow actor and eccentric, Elsa Lanchester.  When an opportunity to direct a film came his way, he jumped at the chance to fashion a singular artistic vision from Davis Grubb's novel, ""The Night of the Hunter.""  The story is based on real events surrounding the 1932 murder of two widows and three children by Harry Powers in Clarksburg, West Virginia.  The screenplay adaptation is by noted journalist and film critic James Agee.

Incredibly, this master of the actor's craft only directed this one film.  Laughton was crushed by the tepid 1955 critical and box office response and swore off directing.  He died in 1962.

THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is not really a film noir, although it at first kind of looks like one.  Laughton said he wanted ""a nightmarish sort of Mother Goose tale.""

There's much in the metaphors of the artful composition and Michael Cortez's often eerily beautiful black and white cinematography - most of it on sets.  Unforgettable images abound -- like the billowing hair of a drowned, serene faced Shelly Winters still in her underwater grave.

The story has children on the run with secret loot entrusted to them by their late father, a thief.  Harry Powell, a cellmate of their executed father's, is after the brother and sister in an effort to claim the stolen money.

Powell is a psychotic, fanatical preacher.  We know that because ""L-O-V-E"" and H-A-T-E"" are tattooed on his knuckles.  Robert Mitchum embodies the laconic but coldly determined Powell who never strays from his course.  Shelly Winters is perfect as the delicate widow and mother of the young children he marries -- and murders.  Silent film star Lillian Gish is a stern but compassionate caretaker of stray children.

Large themes run through this film.  There is terrified childhood with looming, lurking danger always around the corner.  And of course the unmistakable portrayal of hypocritical religion.  No doubt Laughton dealt with these elements throughout his famous but tormented secret life.

The restored Blu-ray transfer is gorgeous.  The later acclaim for this initially dismissed film is deserved.  The whopping extras on this two-disc edition include a two-and-a-half-hour treasure trove of outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage.  More fascinating documentaries, featurettes, archival material, video conversations and an essay by Terrence Rafferty are part of the generous bonus material.

This motion picture is in my personal top 20, meaning, I bought a book called ""Heaven & Hell To Play With -- The Filming Of Night Of The Hunter"" by Preston Neal Jones to read more about it.  The only other book I purchased about a movie was Eric Greene's work about the original Planet Of The Apes.

Robert Mitchum, Shelly Winters, Peter Graves, kid actor Billy Chapin, character actor James Gleason and the great Lillian Gish (from the silent AND talking picture ages) are included in this class of heavy-weight actors which gives the viewer a visual and emotional treat.  Lillian Gish, in particular, uses her face and hands to say so much more than words ever could.

Someone complained about the price of the 2 Blu-ray disc set.  I have to say, if you want to spend that kind of money, do it on this one, The Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind or some other classic.  The special features alone are worth the price.

4237289,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"Combining elements of Southern Gothic with German Expressionism Charles Laughton's ""The Night of the Hunter"" remains an unusual classic. It manages to combine suspense, broad elements of satire, and a dollop of compassion. This is an influence of D. W. Griffith's stylized dramas. Laughton even went so far as to cast Griffith regular Lillian Gish in a pivotal role that echoes her work for Griffith from the silent era. Laughton tells a story that Faulkner or O'Connor might have although with a slightly less populist touch. Featuring an amazing performance from Robert Mitchum that is, at turns, sincere, evil, psychopathic and just south of over-the-top, actor Laughton (""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Mutiny on the Bounty"")was in his 50's when he made his first film in collaboration with director of photography Stanley Cortez (""The Magnificient Ambersons"")and acclaimed writer James Agee (""The African Queen"" the Pulitzer Prize winning novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY)but it's clear that he paid attention on all of those movie sets. A box office dud when it was released the audience  at the time didn't know what to make of Laughton's film. Laughton never directed a film again. Luckily audiences rediscovered this stylized film which is as droll as it is sincere and suspenseful.

There is no doubt that ""The Night of the Hunter"" is an acquired taste like some of Hitchcock and Welles' films but for those who appreciate the film this is the ultimate edition and essential. The film like Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and Welles' ""The Magnificient Ambersons"" focuses on how we saw ourselves in the era the film is set not necessarily on how we really WERE at the time. There is a stylized, theatrical quality to the film that wasn't unnatural for the era. Unlike a contemporary film Laughton wasn't trying to create something that reflects the real world but like the Southern Gothic origins of the story tell a story that reflects the myths, legends and stories of the south that were often told as parables to entertain, enlighten and frighten.

While Laughton didn't have the free reign to adapt the film including all of the darker elements of the novel (the Code was still in effect and all scripts had to be submitted for review prior to production and release) resulting in a film that often has a number of surreal moments that don't exactly fit the needs of the narrative. Laughton pared down Agee's script cutting a fair amount of material to make the film as concise as possible adding to the mystery of the film at times; we don't know why the Preacher behaves the way he does we just know that he is completely crazy. In many respects Mitchum's Preacher reflects every crazy con man that drifted through the south during the Great Depression trying to fleece those that were barely surviving and justifying his ""mission"" to some funhouse mirror reflection of God.

How does it look? Having seen the MGM release of ""The Night of the Hunter"" on DVD (and in Meltnitz at UCLA)I can state that Criterion's Blu-ray (and I'm sure the DVD since it was prepared from the same 2K high definition master)looks the best it ever has on home video. That doesn't mean for those you of you raised on digital video without film grain that the grain has been removed--the fine grain and textures of the film are intact and give the film the marvelous ominious quality it had when it played in theaters removing the murky blacks that were a hallmark of the MGM DVD.

The story based on the novel by Davis Grubb (who contributed sketches and comments to Agee and Laughton in pre- production)focuses on a traveling preacher Harry Powell (Mitchum)who is after the money a bank robber (the late Peter Graves)stole to help his wife (Shelly Winters) and children. Cellmates in prison Powell goes on the hunt for the money after the money of the robber after his execution. He woos and weds the widow of his cellmate terrifying her children while playing the pious minister as he searches for the money suspecting that the children are the only ones who know where it is hidden.

As with all Criterion discs you pay a lot for this BUT you get a lot in return if you are a fan of the film and a film buff. We get a deluxe 28 page booklet with essays about Laughton and writer Agee by Terrence Rafferty and Michael Sragow with plenty of production and behind-the-scenes photos from the film. As film critic F. X. Feeney and assistant director Terry Saunders point out in their excellent commentary track the film was made on the studio lot with a budget of around $700,000 and Laughton spent an exhausting amount of time with his actors to get the best performances he could including the children in the film (Feeney and Saunders point out that Robert Mitchum's biography which suggested that HE directed the child actors is nothing more than fantasy--perhaps he did some time as an actor coaching them but Laughton despite his dislike of children spent the time with them he needed to coach them)going to far as to scrap ALL the footage with one actor and reshooting them with a new performer.

We also get an excellent interview with actor/writer and Laughton biographer Simon Callow (""Five Weddings and A Funeral"")focusing on Laughton's career and the making of the film. An excerpt from ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" is included where the cast perform a deleted scene from the film as well as archival interviews with Mitchum and Cortez. The big attraction though is the new documentary on the making of the film that includes new interviews and on the second disc ""Charles Laughton Directs 'The Night of the Hunter' a two and a half hour compilation of behind-the-scenes footage, stills, and outtakes from the movie.

Robert Gitt of the UCLA Archives who provided the print used for this restoration also appears in an interview with Film Historian and critic Leonard Maltin discussing the ""Charles Laughton Directs"" special feature on disc two. Gitt a long time fixture of the archives has helped shepherd hundreds of films from being swallowed by the mist of history. The work that the archive has done in collaboration with MGM, Criterion and other studios/production companies has been essential in maintaining our cultural history on film. Without them we would have had the disaster that occurred with many silent films disintegrating during the early sound era of the 20th century. During that time frame (from the 30's until the 60's) transferring silent movies was a low priority and many of them either were destroyed in disasters or by the time studios got around to recognizing that silent films were assets were far too gone to do anything with them. We're lucky that films such as ""Metropolis"" have managed to survive in private collections enabling the reconstruction of missing footage. I fear for the digital era movies that we have coming out because unlike film itself once the data is gone reconstruction may be impossible.

If you've never seen ""The Night of the Hunter"" I would probably recommend renting it first to see if it is a movie that appeals to you. Laughton's unusual tone and approach to the material makes ""Hunter"" a film that not everyone appreciates. If you love the film I would definitely pick up the Criterion edition because although it IS expensive, it has an exhaustive catalog of special features covering almost every aspect of the film.

It's a pity that Laughton was so discouraged by the reception of this film as his next project was an film of ""The Naked and the Dead"" and based on ""Hunter"" I imagine film fans would have been in for a treat.

Highly recommended.",1290470400,10,7605,4.815467075038285

On the first disc the bonus features are a mix...a recent making of which didn't really keep my attention...but the 15 minute film from the mid nineties which featured interviews with Mitchum and Winters and more was fascinating.

4237291,3,B003ZYU3TQ,"I'll be brief

NIGHT OF THE HUNTER has long been one of my favorite Top Ten Films.
I saw its first theatrical release, watched it on TV, purchased a Mexican-English 16mm print, got the VHS, the Criterion laserdisc - whew! and finally wound up with the MGM DVD.

Today I happily opened my Amazon.com package and tossed Disc 2 of Criterion's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER release.  The out-take documentary, giving us a chance to see Laughton hammering and cajoling his cast to perfection, was everything I'd hoped for.  Kudos, Cri!

However (and there always is a ""however"", you know), when I inserted Disc 1 and started to watch the ""remastered"" feature itself, my jaw dropped.  The picture was dishwater dull, murky in places
(cellar and river scenes, which are the ""meat"" of this feature, are real let-downs - and dark, dark, dark.  I told myself something must be wrong with my machine; after all, Disc 2 ran without a hitch.  I put on my well-used old MGM version - and was rewarded with a sparkling, crystal clear picture and even seemingly better sound!

By all means, get the Criterion, kids, for Dsc 2 - and then write Criterion and ask what happened the film itself.  I've yet to be disappointed by their product; but I guess there's always a first time.

Oh, and don't toss your old MGM NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.",1290038400,8,1307,4.5905172413793105
4237292,3,B003ZYU3TQ,"Is it just me or is this aspect ratio wrong on the blu-ray?
I have seen Night of the Hunter once or twice in the theaters, and this looks cropped wrong to me. I don't remember ever seeing it widescreen. They just cropped it badly. I don't know all the different aspect ratios, but looking at the bluray, they screwed it up, they made it wider than it was originally, by cropping off the top and bottom of the original image. It isn't an enhancement, it is a butcher job.
I just looked at it last night, so the issue maybe with how my actual TV set is set up (I couldn't find my remote, stuck in the couch somewhere probably), but if you look at the Cortez documentary, and then at the bluray, it seemed to me the shots had be cropped. I noticed it the minute I started watching the film.
Though I am not certain if this is because of my TV or because of the bluray (hopefully because of my TV format set wrong) so take this with a grain of salt.
For such a nice set, this would be a major drawback if I am correct on this, and very disappointing.
If you take a look at the documentary on Cortez, and the footage there, and then compare it to the actual Bluray picture, it is clear the bluray is cropped. In the stabbing scene, Mitchum's feet are clearly visible in the documentary, but no where to be seen on the bluray. I noticed this the minute I starting watching the bluray, top of buildings cut off, etc. It doesn't show the complete frame, a major major sin in my book.
Could someone else take a look at this and update?
I am still going through the set, so this issue may be addressed somewhere.
One of the best movies, if you have never seen it, if any movie is worth the money this one is.
I wouldn't throw away the earlier DVD though.
(update Dec 20th 2010)-In American Cinematographer, Decemeber 1982, page 1982 at the bottom, it says specifically that Night of the Hunter was standard aspect ratio, and that it did not go along with the wide screen trend (also bucking another trend in that NOTH was in black and white). Also I don't see anything that says NOTH was actually ever shown in wide screen, where are the prints ? Why are the prints that have been seen all standard? I am not convinced they didn't botch it (and I think it looks better in standard anyway).",1290038400,4,2279,4.241379310344827
4237293,5,B003ZYU3TQ,"The first disc starts off with an audio commentary moderated by film critic F.X. Feeney and featuring the film's second-unit director Terry Sanders, film archivist Robert Gitt, and Preston Neal Jones, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-and-Hell-to-Play-With-The-Filming-of-The-Night-of-the-Hunter-Limelight/dp/0879109742/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven and Hell to Play With: The Filming of The Night of the Hunter (Limelight)</a>. They point out that Laughton wanted the film to seem like it was being told from the children's point-of-view, as if they were having a nightmare. The participants analyze the use of humor throughout the film and how it offsets the darkness of the Harry Powell character. They also get into a lively discussion about James Agee's screenplay and how the original, longer version was very faithful to the source novel. There is some debate about how much of it Laughton rewrote. This is a very informative track, chock full of factoids, analysis and filming anecdotes to satisfy any fan of this film.

""The Making of The Night of the Hunter"" is a 38-minute retrospective featurette that takes us through the genesis of the film as producer Paul Gregory talks about how he met Laughton. Interestingly, Laurence Olivier was considered for the role of Powell. Laughton worked closely with Davis Grubb and James Agee to make sure that the film was a faithful adaptation.

""Moving Pictures"" is a 15-minute documentary about the film with interviews with key cast and crew members, including Mitchum, Winters and cinematographer Stanley Cortez. While this extra does repeat information from the previous supplement, it is nice to hear these details directly from the people that actually worked on the film.

There is a 1984 interview with Cortez about filming The Night of the Hunter. He speaks admiringly of Laughton and his ability to work with the actors. Cortez says that Laughton knew nothing about the technical aspects of cinematography and trusted him implicitly with the look of the film. Cortez also touches upon the use of light and how he lit certain scenes for a specific effect.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

""Simon Callow on Charles Laughton"" is an interview with the author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charles-Laughton-A-Difficult-Actor/dp/0880641800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charles Laughton: A Difficult Actor</a>. He talks about the man's career and how The Night of the Hunter affected his life. Callow points out the irony that Laughton is known more for directing this film than his extensive acting career. He was very active in live theater and this is what led to his involvement in the film. Callow talks about what drew Laughton to Grubb's novel and covers the production with an obvious emphasis on Laughton.

There is an interest excerpt from the September 25, 1955 episode of The Ed Sullivan Show where Peter Graves and Shelley Winters perform a scene not in the film. Willa visits Harper in prison, which sheds some insight into their relationship.

""Davis Grubb Sketches"" is a collection of drawings that he produced for Laughton to help convey how he envisioned his novel. These sketches are juxtaposed with stills from the film to demonstrate how closely Laughton stuck to them while filming.

The second disc contains the crown jewel for fans of the film. ""Charles Laughton Directs The Night of the Hunter"" is two-and-a-half hours of unused footage and outtakes. There is a conversation between film archivist Robert Gitt and film critic Leonard Maltin that provides some backstory on how this footage was discovered. Gitt was given it in the mid-1970s but it was so disorganized that it took him several years to make sense of it all. Doing it piecemeal when he had the time, he and many volunteers worked away until they had eight hours of footage. He then edited it down to two-and-a-half hours and screened it at UCLA. This footage provides fascinating insight into Laughton's working methods, especially how he got those great performances out of the two children.
