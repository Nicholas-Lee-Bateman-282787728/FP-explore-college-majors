7913636,3,B00000JWWJ,"I felt that Space Invaders only touch upon the surface of the story. What if the aliens meant to take the blacks with them to other planets where they could re-ignite civilization on those planets since it was blacks on the planet first. By turning it into a parable of a parody, Hudlin missed the point Bell was trying to make. I don't recall the second story very well, but the third, Tang, was very powerful and thought-provoking. Wait for the revolution, well, no onoe told them how long or even how far were Chi McBride and Paula Jai Parker are  willing to stay in the poverty that has devastated them. It almost reminded me of the Monsters were due on Maple street; people trying to wait and prepare for an alien attack that wasn't really going to happen. The aliens were waiting for them to overreact which they did. In the case of Tang, it didn't take them long to use their weopons for the cause didn't they. And the last words spoke should give us all a reminder that we are always being watched to see how we react in certain situations.",1337472000,3,1048,4.402061855670103
7913637,5,B00000JWWJ,"This goes into my ever-growing file of brilliant and crucial works that were censored by indifference (and perhaps institutional forces) like the film The Spook Who Sat by the Door (Sam Greenlee), and albums ""Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse"" and ""Outlaw"" by Eugene McDaniels.

This is amazing piece of visual storytelling. It's a travesty that this series isn't more popular. Each of the three vignettes in the film has its own clever, prescient, and still very relevant storylines, with pithy introductions and segues from George Clinton, which count among his best nuggets cosmic-political analysis in the spirit of the ""Cosmic Slop"" and ""America Eats Its Young"" albums. I bought one of the few VHS copies out there and have watched it several times with friends.

If you don't want to be challenged by frank discussions of race, gender, spirituality, and ancestral memory, you will feel very uncomfortable. If you are a fan of Octavia Butler, and/or are tuned-in to James Baldwin stream of loving America through deep, thoughtful, and often painful soul-searching, add this to your library right away.

7913638,2,B00000JWWJ,"The VHS arrived in good condition. When I watched the video the spanish-language stubtitles were a major distraction.  Unlike a dvd, I cannot remove the subtitles.  I emailed the seller requesting a version without Spanish-language subtitles and heard nothing back.  Never again will I use this seller.",1171411200,,302,5.382978723404255
7913639,5,B00000JWWJ,"This is an excellent 3-story short that is a rare find these days.  You will not be disappointed!  It is narrated by George Clinton.  The first story is based on a chapter in Derrick Bell's ""Faces At the Bottom of the Well"" which is an often overlooked, but excellent ""fiction"" book in the African storytelling fashion.  If you haven't read The Space Invaders"""" chapter in his book, you are really missing something.  It gives much more detail than the film...but I digress.  The second story is about a young priest who is struggling with his African/Santeria roots and his newly ""found"" Catholic ""beliefs.""  His true beliefs become evident to him as well as the larger community.  The third story...well, my take on it is the revolution starts at home.  This one definitely needs to be on DVD.",1106352000,12,795,4.744525547445256
7913640,5,B00000JWWJ,"Definitely ahead of it's time.
Each story of the trilogy encourages us to ask some really hard questions about our lives.",1054080000,5,121,4.809523809523809
7913641,5,B00000JWWJ,"i seen this show back in 93 and from what i saw if given the chance this might have been a sucess, george looked creepy flying around were viewers or whoever that scared that george would take the crypt keepers job. if you love p-funk and want to see what kind of visions the director had peep this, and shake your head in agreement that this would hAVE BEEN THE BOMO.",1004313600,3,368,4.197183098591549
7913642,5,B00000JWWJ,"The Chicago Tribune quote on the front of Cosmic Slop's box calls it ""A multi-cultural Twilight Zone.""  That sort of sells it short.  It consists of three stories.  The first is about aliens which promise to  solve America's major problems in exchange for it's African-American  people, making an extremely deep commentary on America's attitude toward  minorities.  The second is about attempts by the Catholic church to  suppress the multi-cultural adaptations of it's faith.  The third is about  the cycle of poverty and abusive behavior and how apparent solutions  sometimes lead to tragic endings.  There is a break between each story in  which Dr. Funkenstein (George Clinton) throws his twist on them.  It helps  if your a PFunk fan when you're interpreting his remarks but you don't have  to know the PFunk lingo to understand the rest.  The stories tell it all.  This video does have it's set backs.  If you can't read Spanish, or don't  want to, the subtitles can be a bit distracting.  Also, Dr. Funkenstein's  floating head, third eye and ever-changing hairdo's are a bit tacky.  There  aren't any surprise appearances by or concert footage of PFunk in it  either.  That is what I was actually hoping for when I ordered this and I  recommend getting The Night Before if that's what you're looking for.  Still, I'm very glad I got this and I highly recommend it.  Because of the  strength of it's social-political commentary, I'm giving Cosmic Slop five  stars.",949536000,25,1471,4.9300411522633745
