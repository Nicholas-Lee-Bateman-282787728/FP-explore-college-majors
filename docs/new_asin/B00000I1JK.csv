three sections of film clips: 1975 to 1980 (the best, IMO), 1981 to 1985, and 1986 to 1990.

There's also collages honoring Gilda Radner and John Belushi, plus holiday shows and past musical guests.
Prince performs one song early, Paul Simon closes the festivities with ""Still Crazy After All these Years.""

Notably absent is Eddie Murphy, who is supposedly represented by his entourage,
yet we get to sample many of his amazing characters and sketches.

This prime time show was presented six nights before the debut of Saturday Night Live's 16th season.

The first ""live"" segment is particularly fine. Members of the current cast stand off to the left and admire past show luminaries (Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Dan Aykroyd, Jim Belushi, etc.) and wonder what wonderful memories that elite circle are discussing. It turns out they're griping about issues with their film studios. Then we switch to a glimpse of Mary Tyler Moore making out with....JON LOVITZ? (That's the ticket!), and a quick segue to Chevy Chase begging Lorne Michael to let him do the opening ""fall."" Lorne counters that Chase is too old at 58 (he was actually 47) and Laraine Newman seconds him.

Several guest hosts appear and at one point Robin Williams takes good-natured pokes at a few members of an audience peppered with celebs.

There's a bittersweet quality to seeing so many favorites still physically in their prime and you can't help pondering those we've lost since 1990, such as Robin, Phil Hartman. George Harrison or Ray Charles, but in general this remains a most entertaining look back at SNL's glory years.

Very highly recommended.",1410134400,3,1713,5.031802120141343

Prince's AWESOME musical performance was edited out. In fact, all the music from the original telecast (which I had videotaped by great luck, but then the VHS tape died..) was missing, due to copyright issues I'm sure, but a great disappointment. This VHS quality was a little scratchy, but good enough. Just to see the 'Bass-o-matic' clip again was worth the price!! Landshark, King Tut, Buhwheat, Roseann Rosannadanna, Blues Brothers, Coneheads, Julia Child, all the best! Skip the last clip where Robin Williams runs through the audience being a non-funny hyper jerk. They probably added that later to try and fill some of the space left by editing out the musical guests.",1354492800,,755,5.0
8078877,4,B00000I1JK,"I saw the 15th anniversary special on VHS years ago and it is quite sincerely the best SNL compilation I've ever seen - it has a freshness and vitality, and the clips are really well selected and edited, making this a laugh a minute romp with just enough pathos thrown in during the very fitting and dignified memorials for those SNL alumni who had left this mortal coil prior to 1990: namely John Belushi and Gilda Radner. The oddest thing about the special is the presence of Eddy Murphy's Entourage - missing the man himself. One gets the distinct impression that back in 1990 Mr Murphy thought himself a little too cool for the likes of SNL. There is so much to rave about on this special, and yet it is still only available on VHS. Come on SNL - get your act together and release this excellent moment in event television history on DVD for everyone to enjoy!",1316217600,3,864,4.440251572327044
