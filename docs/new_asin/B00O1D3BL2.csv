6699508,5,B00O1D3BL2,"This is a marvelous series giving insight to the history and beauty of a few Scottish estates and mansions/castles.  Since our name is Sinclair, we were especially interested in the tour of Rosslyn Chapel.  We visited there several years ago while the scaffolding was on the exterior.  It was nice to see it finished and hear more about the history.  I actually purchased four additional copies of this to share with family.  Thanks to the producers for a wonderful look at the Scotland we love.",1423353600,5,495,4.776470588235294
6699509,5,B00O1D3BL2,"Wonderful! I plan to show this video to some friends to see if we can propose an historic restoration for a local property. The very best part of the videos is how the Prince of Wales spearheaded efforts to develop a training center at Dumfries House. I am a retired educator, and this concept is of great interest to me.",1421193600,6,321,4.366666666666666
6699510,5,B00O1D3BL2,"4 1/2 STARS -- WELL PRODUCED AND BEAUTIFULLY FILMED -- SLIGHTLY MORE FOLKSIE THAN THE ""SECRETS OF --- CASTLE"" SERIES

This excellent series follows four estates in Scotland (actually three and one famous chapel) along with the story of their current inhabitants, how the property supports itself, it's construction, popular events held at the estate, and even a few ghost stories.  Though the production values are very excellent and their are many breath taking views of the estate, I would still say it's just one or two hairs shy of the very polished and somewhat dramatic series ""Secrets Of"" featuring stately houses of England.  In some ways that is probably appropriate for a series featuring Scottish country estates and some people may appreciate the approach.  That is not to say these estates are any lesser in their greatness.  Here is a small summary of the four episodes in this set:

Inverary Castle - Home to the seat of the Duke of Argyle and the Campbell Clan world wide.  The industries and tourism surrounding this estate were quite extraordinary and there are many world events held at the estate such as a classic auto show.  The land associated with this estate are amazingly beautiful.  This was the stand in for ""Duneagle Castle"" in a previous Downton Abbey Christmas special.

Dumfries House - Formerly a seat of the Earl of Dumfries and later rescued from ruin by Prince Charles himself.  This house was a veritable museum of Chippendale furniture and houses nearly 10% of all surviving original pieces.  This modern story of an old house shows a similar but modern model of an estate providing an astounding number of jobs and even a center for developing tradesmen from the local populace devastated by the demise of other industry like mining.

Kinkardine - A house inspired by wealth rather than title.  Inherited by the current Bradford family which derived from Mary Pickering though descended to fairly every day circumstances before grasping the challenge in modern times of restoring the estate and turning it into a financially self sustaining entity.  It is a sort of Mecca for anglers, shootists, and other sportsmen.

Rosslyn Chapel - This is a slight departure as it is not a residence.  This small cathedral like chapel sits on a wooded hill and is the one featured in the movie Davinci Code.  In some ways truth is even more engaging that literary fantasy.  The extraordinary chapel is remarkable for it's beautiful 15th century carvings that are some of the most enigmatic and prolific in the world.  The episode walks a careful line, tying in the mythology of the popular book, while promoting equally engaging but true history of the chapel that you would never hear otherwise.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  This program is immensely enjoyable, though a little less regal for those used to programs like the other one I mentioned.  As long as you know what to expect, there should be no disappointment whatsoever.  Regardless, I recommend giving it a rent first unless you are already sure it's exactly what you want.  I really enjoyed it.",1421193600,21,3072,4.918446601941747

6699588,5,B00O1D3BL2,it was a great series.  I especially liked the one on Dumfries and how the royal family is not only restoring it for it's own sake but also using it to help create training opportunities and jobs for an area that has been hit so hard by the closing of mines.

6699737,5,B00O1D3BL2,"I absolutely love this series. My favorite is Inveraray Castle. Torquhil Campbell (who doesn't just love that name) and his wife Eleanor Cadbury are a most delightful couple, bringing their home from a bygone era to present day. Charming and hardworking, they explain how one carries on the upkeep from day to day in a spectacular estate setting. Dumfries House, a wonderful story constructed by Prince Charles himself, a very heartwarming restoration.  Rosslyn Chapel, setting for the DaVinci Code. Then you have Kincardine Castle with Andrew and Nicky Bradford, a modern day hardworking couple, keeping their beautiful estate running and preserved for all to see. What sets the tone for me with these DVDs is how much work it is to run these homes in modern times, the gratitude of the owners to the visiting the public and how they recognize themselves gratefully lucky to reside in such historical splendor. Beautifully filmed with gracious and ever so charming down to earth owners, a joy to watch!",1477440000,,1003,5.042168674698795

6699745,5,B00O1D3BL2,"Shows the styles, architecture, furniture, and love put into these beautiful showcases.

6699816,2,B00O1D3BL2,I've only seen the first episode about Inverrary Castle. It seemed more like an extended ad for the site than an exploration of the castle and its environs. My expectations may have been too high. I was looking for history and so on. Instead it was about how the current Duke and his wife run the place for tourists. I love Scotland but I'm not really interested in the fact that the Duke likes to use a chainsaw or that they host classic car events.  I hope the rest of the episodes are more focused on what these places symbolize and what roles they've played over the years.,1474848000,,577,4.342592592592593

6699821,4,B00O1D3BL2,I really enjoyed the first 3. The last one wasn't an estate at all but a gothic chapel. It was refreshing to see how real people run these massive estates themselves and with such respect for the past but vision for the future.,1474070400,,227,4.3023255813953485
6699822,1,B00O1D3BL2,Not what I expected.  Not much about the castle.,1473984000,,48,4.333333333333333

6699849,4,B00O1D3BL2,The history of the castles and the stories of how things have changed and how some haven't was very interesting.

Historical insights added an additional layer of interest to what otherwise might be a good quality video tour.  A glimpse into a world of class structure which was for the most part symbiotic and mutuallyl advantageious.  Landscapes were stunning.  Good to see that some of these estates are being preserved for future generations to visit and learn about their heritage.  The ""repurposing"" of some of  these Estates has much to offer in an educational and economic sense as well.  Models worth considering and adapting in a transitioning world.",1468540800,,652,5.201923076923077

6700108,5,B00O1D3BL2,"Really well done. I'd suggest knowing a bit of Scotch history and the interaction with the English to get the most out of it. Genuine Scotch owners of today tell you about it also. - some have ownership in the family for hundreds and hundreds of years. there is one fellow who was a junior family member, not in the older son position, who did take over a dilapidated estate and is bringing it back. It's also very telling that almost all the castle owners feel a responsibility towards the villages and people around them. Surely a complex thing but they did not develop that side. A snapshot of history, not just a guided tour through a castle.",1464739200,,646,4.483050847457627

So, whether familiar to you or not, you will certainly find the architecture and landscapes very intricate and beautiful.

6700156,1,B00O1D3BL2,"I started with this episode and was disapointed to the point I did not watch any of the other episodes until a good while later. The home owners of Inveraray seem to find themselves pretty interesting, but I did not. The Duke really liked telling people he was "" clan chieftan"" and ""this is my house"".  The Duchess thought showing her wedding dress and telling us how beautiful it is was somehow important to learning about the estate.  Their main concern as far as I could tell was making money for the estate and did seem to give any thought as to what they and the estate might be able to contribute locally. Their plans to earn money to support their estate were similar to what Lord Montagu did, but he has a very interesting life story and sadly the owners of Inveraray do not. They came off as self concerned and haughty. Also it was pretty disapointing that the ""clan chieftan of the Campbell clan worldwide"" did not even have a Scottish accent.  Episodes 2 Dumfries and 3 Kincardine are fantastic though so try not to let this one throw you off.",1463097600,,1054,4.450777202072539

6700162,5,B00O1D3BL2,"Another wonderful, delightfully varied series from PBS. Each was unique and surprising, and brilliantly edited. In each episode, my husband and I were dazzled by the magnificent scenery, architecture, and details presented. And, we were somewhat amused by the editing, which clearly stepped carefully around a few topics... and that was a statement in itself.

All in all, this was one of the better series of documentaries about historic homes in the UK. If you love England or Scotland or Wales, or anything in that general area... this series is exceptional in a very good way.",1462492800,3,580,5.041666666666667

6700249,4,B00O1D3BL2,"The worst part as with an movie, tv show, You Tube video explaining something is the uncontrollable urge to put drumming, tapping, or any kind of music anywhere they can and especially over top of somebody speaking. That's what the one star off is for. There's a reason why school teachers don't play music or have drumming playing over top of their lectures. They want you to absorb and remember the information without distraction. That concept has been lost in recent years.

The title, Great Estates, may lead you to think this is just a history lesson that includes architecture and design, but this is truly a human community story through and through.

You meet the real people who own the estates (who often do manual labor - surprise!). You'll meet the hired help and also the town people who rely on the estate and / or the estate owners for their livelihoods in various ways and on and on.

Owners describe aspects of what it takes to run an estate and ideas they've come up with to offset the tremendous cost of owning such a property. Hired help and people in the surrounding town speak about what the estate means to them and how it has touched their family -  even from generations past.

You wouldn't think so, but each episode is unique and memorable.

The series does include bits about architecture, design, and history,  but it is mostly about the human beings working together towards one goal - restoration of what needs restored and preservation for future generations.",1460937600,,1492,4.7153846153846155

A common thread seems to be the very deep attachment the current owners have to their estates, and their commitments to preserving history, as well as honoring what they believe their ancestors would have wanted the estates to become.  Keeping one of these money pits up and running is a major task in itself but these folks also contribute to the local community and share their homes unselfishly.

6700410,4,B00O1D3BL2,"Very interesting look at three estates and one (really well-known) chapel attraction in Scotland.  The primary thrust of these programs is to look at how owners -- historic families or others -- run estates in the 21st century; how they make otherwise ""money pits"" sustainable. These programs are NOT tours of historic houses, although a few public rooms are generally shown. Also, while Rosslyn Chapel is medieval, the three houses profiled are all relatively recent in construction. Those looking for a scan of Scottish castles will be disappointed.
With those notes, the programs are well-made and include fairly close looks at estate owners' lives and work (generally, very hard work). They are realistic overviews of how estates have been re-thought to pay for themselves and continue to benefit their local communities. These models can't work everywhere, but they are good examples of people trying to save something locally or nationally important for future generations.",1456876800,,979,5.357142857142857

The current Duke of Argyll and his wife not only run the vast estate but operate the castle for tourism. They live in the top 2 floors of the grand castle, and open the rest of the castle for tours year around. They have also started an annual ""Best of the West"" music festival weekend that draws people from fire and wide. We happened to be there last September during the BOW festival and it was fun to hear the lively music.

Plus, it was wonderful to see the way Prince Charles has helped the town around the estate through his patronage.  Rosslyn Chapel has a fascinating history and I liked the architectual details of it but that isn't an estate per se.

6701162,4,B00O1D3BL2,This was of interest to me because I enjoy seeing the large homes.  What made this even better was seeing the owners of the estates working to stay afloat in the modern world and what it takes to keep the estate.  The program showing Prince Charles' interest and support in the preservation of one of the estates and extending that to community re-development was very good.,1440201600,,374,4.651515151515151

6701181,2,B00O1D3BL2,It was too much about the residents and not enough views/info/history of the estate.  More like a marketing video for prospective clients.,1438300800,,138,5.2727272727272725

6701187,3,B00O1D3BL2,"I really wanted to learn about the history of these estates, the history of the paintings, furnishing and more. Maybe how they were constructed, the purpose of the rooms, etc. There is some of that but really they pick maybe three rooms to show you and then spend the rest of the episode in what seems like a desperate attempt to convince the viewer these places are great community hangouts or something. This series really advertises how the rich British left trains a few locals to cook or serve them food and thereby are congratulated by PBS or BBC or whoever made it for ""creating opportunity."" Not a bad show but possibly titled incorrectly. Should have been, ""Rich Leftists Dealing With Self-Created Guilt at Great Estates in Scotland.""",1437609600,3,743,4.8125

The estates they picked were absolutely beautiful, and ones that I had not seen before.  The interviews were quite well done, and I especially enjoyed the one with HRH Prince Charles.  He hasn't been one of my favorite people over the years, but this show presents him in an entirely different light than one usually sees him. There is no question that the camera work is exceptional. The only criticism I can come up with on this engaging show is that there were not enough estates featured.  My only hope right now is that PBS will decide to continue their winning scheme and present us with more of their well done pageantry.",1431475200,11,744,4.621212121212121

There was a bit of history, a lot about what it takes to keep this property maintained and profitable...lots of hard work, and many intimate interviews with the Duke and Duchess of Argyll who appear to be quite practical and enthusiastic about their property and the work they are doing.

6701262,5,B00O1D3BL2,"I was most fortunate to have been invited to spend six months as the guest of a friend who was an antique dealer in Paisley Scotland. During that time I was given a tour, by my friend, of many towns and villages. I saw numerous natural and historic wonders. Inveraray Castle was certainly one of the best places I visited. I was there in 1981 just as the restoration work was being completed. I recall smelling fresh paint in the Castle. I think we were in the dining room when we met the Duke, father of the current Lord Campbell. If the Duke remembers a large Tennessean in a kilt when he was about 12, that was me.

Rich in history and local appeal, this series is great mainly because it shows the viewer what Scotland has to offer outside of what they think they know, most likely meaning bagpipes and haggis.
