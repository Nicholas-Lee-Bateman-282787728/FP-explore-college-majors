7518380,1,B017S3Z1IW,"I never watched the other Noah's Ark movie.... I heard too much about it, and knew it wasn't biblical. This one sounded better and more biblical, but I didn't care for it much. It took a long time before Noah was told to build the ark, and then he did it by himself for a long time. He had 4 sons, though one was adopted. Most of the movie was him and his family arguing about the ark and his youngest son - the adopted one - sneaking into the city for fun.

The flood doesn't come until the last 10 minutes of the movie, and as the rain comes gushing down; that is when the animals come - not sure that is biblical either - it shows the ark being lifted on the waters, then BOOM, there is Noah again on dry land and the flood is over.....the movie was a disappointment. I am guessing it was a low budget film, but they shouldn't have bothered. It was slow, almost boring, and the flood part was over so fast, I would have missed it had I blinked.",1456790400,9,947,4.037234042553192

7518405,1,B017S3Z1IW,So disappointed. .we turned it off after the scene where Noah's son and his wife discuss their sex life. Furious they mar up a beautiful story with smut. What does this have to do with a story that should be holy?  These kinds of things are unacceptable in a movie that we would love to show our children. They would have done better to give it an epic feeling like Ben Hur or the Ten Commandments.  It  just shows the heart and the spiritual condition of the writers and producers.,1471478400,3,482,4.333333333333333

7518408,5,B017S3Z1IW,"This movie is so very much better than any other with the name. Great acting, thought provoking and yet true to the story with only a couple of minor exceptions. Very good for all except the youngest viewers and a good movie to discuss with teens and young adults. Thanks for being one of the biggest positive surprises we have run across in a long while!",1468540800,5,355,4.393939393939394

8740485,5,B017S3Z1IW,The principles of the movie is as the principles of the Bible. What went on with man in that era of time is going on today but worst.,1528588800,,133,3.7857142857142856

8740487,1,B017S3Z1IW,"Very dissappointing, I mean if you're going to make a movie about Noahs Ark- make it Biblical!  Only 8 people boarded the Ark, and all Noahs sons with him, and their wives.  I don't recommend",1512777600,,191,4.428571428571429
8740488,3,B017S3Z1IW,"First thing...I just paid to rent this and after I watched it, a suggestion was made here on Amazon like they do... that I watch another Noah's Ark (along with some other recommendations). It says that it was made 2 years after this one and shows it has some of the same stars and a different cover. BUT... it is the exact same movie!!!  It is free for those of us with the UP channel through Amazon. So, I just paid for something I should have gotten for free.... Irritating!

As for the movie, it was pretty good, but it did stray quite a bit from Bible. I was very disappointed that they totally skipped most of the time in the ark and didn't even caption something about how long they were in the arc. Not even showing the dove. I would probably watch it again, but this time for free!  lol",1510790400,,837,4.305732484076433

8740490,4,B017S3Z1IW,"They should have called this version of Noah's Ark, The United Kingdom presents Noah's Ark. In this this rendition of Noah's Ark, Noah had an Irish son, a son from South London, a son from East London, and all but one son had black wives. LOL. I thought it was the other way around (one son of some color, one son with no color, and one 'gray' son). Even the 'Messenger' seems to be from South London (not to mention that he is not fair as most Messengers have been known to be). All of that, however, is trivial. I don't care that this take of Noah's Ark is slightly off its mark. In this day and age of Babylonian filled entertainment, when it's very unpopular to endorse the only true Candidate for sovereign ruler, any heartfelt attempt to present Christian entertainment is merit worthy in and of itself. So suspend your expectations and give The United Kingdom presents Noah's Ark, oops, I mean, Noah's Ark at least a view.",1488153600,,929,4.470588235294118
8740491,3,B017S3Z1IW,Good! But the end was not the way the Bible says it is. No doves,1484784000,,64,3.3333333333333335
8740492,2,B017S3Z1IW,"Well made movie, I did not care for the storyline. Diverged to far from Biblical account, but for some the special effects, which are fantastic, will help overcome the liberty taken by the director in regards to the accuracy of the story line.",1483142400,3,243,4.674418604651163
