8584412,2,B00CP77MPC,"This is an interesting premise. Instead of emphasizing what is right in traditional Christian faith, it emphasizes what is wrong in the Mormon faith. It seems distorted and taking things out of context. Having studied the Holy Bible extensively, I know it's true, but through prayer and the Holy Spirit working in me, not just from study.
However, there are verses that contradict others. There are inconsistencies in translations between languages- I've studied it in Spanish and English translations. There are differences in accounts of the Gospel and ministry of Christ given by different apostles. There are even differences regarding the resurrection of Christ. But that is a quality that points to the truth - since any story that is perfectly consistent from all sources is accepted as false by investigators in crime and in historical records.
The whole idea of this is incomplete and doesn't follow logic consistently.
I know a lot of Mormons and have seen their commitment to Jesus in their daily lives. Several are among the most devout disciples of Christ that I have seen.
In this video, they missed out on some points and distorted others. The Bible is the word of God and it is given through differing human accounts. Some faiths emphasize one point of doctrine over another. They even ignore some of the doctrines. Could God still talk to mankind or call prophets in our day? Is there some preparation for the God's second coming? Only God knows for sure. We can't create Him in our image. There is absolute truth and only God is the source of it. As Paul says in 2 Corinthians 2:13-16

""13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?""

Paul had ""The Mind of Christ."" Do we? Do we rely on certain concepts in the Bible more than others? Do we interpret the Bible without fully understanding God's will? ""/Do we rely on the words which mans wisdom teacheth"" more than the intended meaning and context of original quotes in the Bible and just by the study and interpretation of the Bible, as this video attests. If understanding was perfect just through studying the Bible  there could be one Lord, one faith, and one baptism - but how many different Christian religions exist?

Is the Mormon faith true? That's what this video claims. How does anyone know except from God.
I believe there is a lot of good in this faith because by their fruits I know them. And that's enough for me to accept them as they are. The questions this video shows are really just trying to stir people up against their faith.

I simplify things by assuming that I know everything that's true about the Bible. Studying in Israel from scholars who've studied ancient translations and copied scripts was an amazing experience. But, all of my acceptance of the Bible as God's word, in fact my belief in God, Himself, comes from the one source of truth-God. It's only through the workings of the whispers of the Holy Spirt that I know of His love and His power and His peace. Those things don't come from studying. The premise that the Mormon faith is wrong comes through study and logic alone.

At best, I give this a D for trying.",1529884800,,3558,4.669856459330144

8584416,2,B00CP77MPC,"How do you get to a perfect place called Heaven, stand before a perfect God, who demands perfection to be in His presence because everyone on earth is imperfect and there is nothing we can do to change that imperfection?

Don't we have to rely completely on the perfection that can only come from our perfect God? If so how? Remember perfection cannot be handed down from what is not perfect such as man or woman on the earth.

If we reach perfection on earth then why do we die because death is the result of that imperfection?

when we die and have one sin on our record how can we be perfect after death? How does death change the imperfection?

If the Book of Mormon is true, why do Indians fail to turn white when they become Mormons? (2 Nephi 30:6, prior to the 1981 revision)

If the Book of Mormon is true, then why has the Mormon church changed it? Examples are: 1 Nephi 11:21; 19:20; 20:1 and Alma 29:4. Compare these with the original Book of Mormon. (Gerald and Sandra Tanner have counted 3913 changes in the book of Mormon, excluding punctuation changes)

How did Joseph Smith carry home the golden plates of the Book of Mormon, and how did the witnesses lift them so easily? (They weighed about 230 lbs. Gold, with a density of 19.3 weighs 1204.7 lbs. per cubic foot. The plates were 7"" x 8"" by about 6."" See Articles of Faith, by Talmage, p. 262, 34th ed.)

If Moroni devoutly practiced the Mormon Gospel, why is he an angel now rather than a God? (Doc. & Cov. 132:17, 37)

Why was Joseph Smith still preaching against polygamy in October 1843 after he got his revelation in July 1843 commanding the practice of polygamy? (Doc. & Cov. 132; and History of the Church, vol. 6, p. 46, or Teachings of the Prophet, p. 324)

God rejected the fig
leaf aprons which Adam and Eve made (Gen. 3:21). Why do Mormons memorialize the fall by using fig leaf aprons in the secret temple ceremonies?",1430438400,2,2606,4.482029598308668
