3515027,2,B001CO42H0,"I bought this dvd set thinking I would recieve such a bargain, but I was wrong. This DVD set is not very good at all. The dvd quality is terrible! Mostly old movies with a voiceover, I found this to be distracting. The only good part of this set is that a copy of ""Glory"" was included but not in its DVD case but a sleeve. I would stay away from this set unless you want Glory with extra dvd's containing info on the civil war. Get Ken Burn's CIvil War for the best experience.",1246233600,13,477,4.031578947368421
3515028,4,B001CO42H0,"Not as refined, taut, or gripping as Ken Burns' work, this does serve as an excellent introduction to Civil War history. And the price is unbeatable.  Consider that Both sets are of similar length, and that Ken Burns' Civil War is over $100... quite an investment. (Worth it if you can afford it, however) Though low budgeted, the filmmakers do quite a lot with stock footage, photos, and reenactments.

The version of ""The American Civil War"" I purchased came packaged with a widescreen copy of ""Glory"".  Which was certainly welcome as well.",1240185600,6,542,4.869565217391305
3515029,1,B001CO42H0,"Just a collection of old movie clips and amateur video.  A definite political revisionist documentary blaming the whole civil war on slavery.  The use of old black and white poor quality video improperly gives the viewer a sense that it is actual footage, if they don't understand that technology was not available.",1240099200,15,315,5.038461538461538
3515030,1,B001CO42H0,"If you find it hard to believe that a 5 DVD set would cost less than $20, you'll learn why when you watch the first DVD.  The visual portion consists mainly of spliced scenes from old movies, a wholly inappropriate way to present history.  The narrative is informative if you are new to the topic, and the text contains a few moving moments, most notably when they imitate Ken Burns method of reading eyewitness accounts, but the program lacks a compelling dramatic structure, making the overall result unsatisfactory.",1228521600,19,518,4.875
8288428,5,B001CO42H0,I bought this for my dad for his birthday and he said he enjoyed it.  He's a history nut.,1491955200,,89,3.6842105263157894
8288429,4,B001CO42H0,"As one reviewer stated, the visuals were crappy and repeated. The film looked more like an intermediate-level Powerpoint presentation. Graphics were ill-sized, with some of them overlapping slide titles. Titles were frequently in fonts that were hard to read, not just because they were in a fancy cursive, but because some were in (neon) blue against a black screen.

There were clips of Civil War re-enactments and old movies. There was (I kid you not) some footage taken from an old silent film, of a white man in black face depicting a slave, white lips and all. That kind of thing just makes you scratch your head. Someone was honestly trying to put together an intellectual movie about the Civil War, and did so with minstrel-like footage. Battlefield enactment clips were shot in such a way that you could see the gridiron's 10-yard goal lines. I have a feeling that this movie was edited with whatever footage that could be had for free.

Nevertheless, there was something to be learned for me, like why the indentured servitude system petered out, and how native Americans, who made difficult slaves, were sold into slavery to Caribbean island. Hard to escape an island. This movie filled in gaps of my knowledge, the kind of smaller pieces of information that never makes it into history books. It seems as though the intent of the movie was to fill in gaps left by other movies, whiz through ones filled in by others. For instance, a lot of time was spent on the battles in Kentucky, which I don't remember ever hearing about before, yet only a couple minutes seemed to be dedicated to Gettysburg. Also, I learned about the war still being fought after Lees surrender to Grant, including a few guys who finally gave up the ghost in 1867.

This was definitely a worthwhile 5 disks for the new information to be gleaned from it.",1464566400,,1837,4.716510903426792
8288430,2,B001CO42H0,"This set is fine, although I found out that I already own it in another collection. My question is why is everyone bragging about a 14 disk set ( which is what I ordered based on their reviews) when this set that was sent to me is only 3 disks...These are NOT, repeat NOT documentaries from any history channel program, rather a rather low budget offering. I hope that someone could tell me what collection contains the 14 disk set, and not what was delivered. In short, buyer beware!...The reviews don't match the product...",1387152000,,525,4.595744680851064
8288431,5,B001CO42H0,This is a most have Civil War Series! I have seen many movies on the Civil War however this one is one of the Best! I would Highly Recommend it to everyone!,1373328000,,156,3.90625
8288432,5,B001CO42H0,"chose this rating because the product in optimum conditions.
I like it for its quality and presentation is excellent canned
I recommend it to any client interested in a good documentary on the civil war.",1362096000,,203,4.828571428571428
8288433,2,B001CO42H0,"I got this set at Sam's Club for ten bucks and thought it would be some cheap educational entertainment. I was wrong.
The first half an hour or more is an overly drawn out history of slavery in the America's and much more than was needed to set the stage for war.
I've only watched the first two DVD's and don't know if I will waste my time on the rest. I don't understand how they can spend 15 minutes giving a detailed account of the Battle of Mill Springs but only a minute or so on Shiloh.
My biggest problem is with unforgivable historical mistakes. At first I wasn't sure. There would be little things I would hear and think, is that right? I wasn't absolutley sure until they continually labeled the Battle of Perryville as happening on October 4th 1862 when I knew for sure it was the 8th. It validates the questions I had on the accuracy of the account of Antietam, Perryville, and Fort Donelson. I really don't care enough to go back and double check. This is just a poorly made DVD series.",1343779200,9,1000,4.324468085106383
8288434,1,B001CO42H0,I think I would have liked this disc but the sound was messed up on the disc set I received.  What I could hear was so disjointed that it just grated on my nerves to the extent that I could not bear to watch it.  Sorry.  I think if the sound would have been good the whole disc would have been interesting.,1341360000,2,306,3.903225806451613
8288435,1,B001CO42H0,"I actually bought this DVD set through another website but it is the very same one!
My wife could not get the menu to work at all on any of the 5 CDs.
To get each DVD to play she would have to basically stop the DVD and then press the play button.
We did not even bother to try and watch the ""bonus"" DVD.
I have contacted the seller for a full refund which I hope to get.
Personally I would recommend sticking with a known ""brand"" of either The History Channel or PBS.",1325894400,6,468,3.9368421052631577
8288436,5,B001CO42H0,"So prophesied Abraham Lincoln, in a speech given on June 16th, 1858--two years before his election to the Presidency would trigger the collapse of national unity. The cause--a fundamental paradox in the country's architectural plan. Built as an experiment in freedom, America remained committed to the institution of slavery, and its foundations were cracking under the strain.

THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR creates a vivid portrait of America's greatest internal crisis, from the first antislavery protests to Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Along the way, this series examines the moral, political, and strategic forces that set brother against brother for more than four years, in what is generally understood to be the first modern war.

Created by some of the most respected producers and historians of the genre this 5-DVD set entertains, educates and conveys a message that should remain with us all. With the help of several thousand living history re-enactors, THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR goes beyond the fog of war and allows you to experience the glory and heartache of the battles that changed war forever.

Special Features:
Bonus Feature Film: GLORY starring Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman

8288437,3,B001CO42H0,"This inexpensive three DVD set tries mightily to clone Ken Burns' masterful THE CIVIL WAR, but it falls far short. Made up partly of still graphics with voiceover recitations of wartime reports and correspondence and partly of filmed reenactments, THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR definitely will hold the viewer's interest, but it breaks no new ground at all in presenting the Civil War in word and image. Everything presented here has been presented elsewhere, and generally with better quality.

Beyond the obviously low budget with which the producers had to contend a number of irritating historical errors have crept in to this documentary. When discussing historical figures, a portrait of the named person generally appears onscreen. In the case of Gideon Welles, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, his name is consistently misspelled ""Wells."" This is an example of basic fact-checking laziness, and is really intolerable. Worse yet, after the Battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg (July 1863) the film picks up its narrative in the late winter of 1864, some nine months later. The gap in time is inexplicable and unaddressed, and gives the viewer an incomplete history and stamps it as a second-rate work.

Lastly, and perhaps leastly, the documentary displays a very subtle but definite prejudice toward the Confederate cause. Civil War era songs about ""shooting Billy Yank,"" detailed descriptions of even minor Confederate victories, and narrative descriptions of ""the graybacks gallantly charging"" give the documentary a partisan feel, especially in the near absence of counterbalancing comments in regard to the Union.

The one advantage this set has is price, so if you are interested in the Civil War but can't afford the far superior work by Ken Burns this is an adequate stand-in until such time as your pocket can stand the strain.",1308528000,4,1830,5.217687074829932
