5147227,5,B008C0C23I,I have a Great Pyrenees that I rescued 6 years ago.  He was mistreated very badly.  He is the most wonderful and loving dog you could ever want.  Seeing the Great Pyrenees (adults and puppies) in the movie was absolutely the greatest thing you could see.  I will watch it over and over again along with Santa Paws.,1353715200,,314,4.362068965517241

5147229,5,B008C0C23I,This movie is going to be a Christmas classic!!! The girl is sooo cute!!! The puppies are even cuter!!! The message the movie gave was also beautiful and I cried at the end!!!! ! I wish the Xmas season was just like this movie!!!,1353628800,2,229,4.2272727272727275
5147230,3,B008C0C23I,"i'm pretty satisfied with the quality of this movie.  as a single dad, i appreciate the convenient diversion of attention from Every Single Thing In The World to Just One Thing (this movie) so that is a big plus.

i found myself a little bit into the movie, more so than most of the Air Bud/Pups series, though you can't really beat the classic Air Bud.  i didn't think much could be done with a SECOND christmas pups movie, but hey, i can applaud the crew's integrity and steadfastness.

so the kids like it, which is good, and i could stand it, which is good too.  the only qualm i had with this release is that i'm not sure if it really belongs on blu-ray.  i'm all about high definition :)  but i don't think that this really had the visuals to get me THAT interested.  maybe stick to regular old DVD next time.

anyways, give it a shot.  who rents blu rays anymore?  maybe get it at a red box?  or just get it through amazon, i appreciate what they do.",1353283200,5,957,4.197802197802198
5147231,5,B008C0C23I,"This is a great family movie and will be a new classic for kids of all ages.  My younger daughter loves the dogs and my older daughter loved Josh Feldman, the human character who did a great job and will be the next Disney cutie.  As a mom I loved the believable cast, great music and an important lesson learned at the end, not to mention that the whole family could sit and watch together.  Buy and enjoy.",1352419200,24,407,4.1923076923076925
5147232,5,B008C0C23I,"This was a cute movie bringing forth the Santa Paws series again. My kids loved the original movie and when they saw that we had received this movie to watch the wasted no time in getting me to put it on. The premise of the movie was fun and the dogs definitely get into some mischief, but in the end they learn some valuable lessons about the Christmas season and about themselves and they share this with the viewers as well. I don't want to give away too much, but this movie was a lot of fun for the whole family, and if your kids are like my daughters they will love the movie and adore the puppies!",1352246400,14,604,4.127118644067797

8526701,3,B008C0C23I,"Ok. I get it. Its talking puppies , so plot holes should be over looked.

But come on !! People  lose Christmas spirit  and become complete A-holes? A widower who was super devoted to his family suddenly brushes every bit of their lives off and ignores them? The animal guy suddenly hates dogs ?

They didn't get their humanity sucked away

Other than that , its talking puppies so they enjoyed it",1513987200,,397,4.458333333333333
