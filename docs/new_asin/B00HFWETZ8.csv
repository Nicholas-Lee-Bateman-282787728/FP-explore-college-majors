6161800,4,B00HFWETZ8,"I hate to tell you but ""20,000,000 Miles to Earth"" ,and""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" are both available on blu ray and with a colorized version option,if you're into that sort of travesty. I have them as a 4 disk Ray Harryhausen collection,and I have seen them for sale separately.""The Giant Claw"" is available in a fabulous 4 movie collection of Sam Katzman along with""Creature with the Atom Brain"",""Zombies of Mora Tau"" and the classic""Werewolf"". "" Mothra"" holds no interest for me but can be bought separately. This is a great price for these movies but as I don't know what the quality is like, I can tell you that both Giant Claw and It Came from Beneath the Sea are in the 1.85 to 1 correct aspect ratio on the aforementioned collections. So if you don't care about the video quality or the fact that you're missing about one third of the picture,then by all means purchase this collection. As for the other reviewers disparaging remarks concerning ""The Giant Claw"",I beg to differ! It IS one of the worst monster movies of all time...but is one of the BEST unintentional comedies ever made! It's priceless! One of the best "" so bad it's good"" examples of moviemaking of all time. This opens up another universe of movies,countless entries of wonderfully entertaining films that most dismiss as ""bad movies"". Watch Giant Claw with an open mind and you'll be laughing your butt off. Then...you'll be hooked...""Plan 9 From Outer Space"",""Attack of the 50 ft Woman,""The Killer Shrews"",etc. A world of wonderful 50's delights awaits...Enjoy!",1393977600,9,1543,4.826415094339622
6161801,4,B00HFWETZ8,"Okay, I liked ""20 Million Miles to Earth"" even though it is a so-so movie. I also enjoyed ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" another so-so movie. I liked them because I love the work of special effects expert Ray Harryhausen. The movies are trite and poorly produced but Harryhausen's effects are state of the art for those early movies.

""The Giant Claw"" was just terrible. The monster was just terrible. It's a turkey.

I can't even look at ""Mothra"" which is a bomb. I have no idea why anyone likes the Japanese monster movies. So I didn't bother to watch this thing this time around. I saw it when it first came out and that was enough.",1393459200,8,635,4.372881355932203
6161802,5,B00HFWETZ8,"These are fun movies to watch, even if the plots and the science behind them are full of holes and terribly imperfect if subjected to analysis.  Heck, why bother!  They're entertaining enough.  And the movies in this digital version have been well transferred (from my personal point of view): the sound and image and good, not grainy, and there's nothing that will prevent playback from being continuous and smooth.  I must say I watched them in my computer, though... but, still, it was all fine and dandy.",1526688000,,508,4.804597701149425

6161808,5,B00HFWETZ8,"Very well put together set of 4 old, but very good Sci-Fi movies. I saw Mothra at the old Chief Theater for 20 cent in 1950's on a Saturday afternoon as part of a double showing, WOW! I saw the other three as a kid on tv on Saturday at in the 1960's.

6161834,5,B00HFWETZ8,"Great collection of films. I own several copies of The Giant Claw - which is my favorite B movie. I've wanted a copy of 20 Million Miles to Earth for years since I love pretty much everything Harryhausen ever did. Same goes for It Came From Beneath the Sea. I was a bit surprised about the inclusion of Mothra. I don't mind the movie, but prefer Godzilla and Rodan to Mothra. I would've enjoyed seeing another 'American' film, such as the Valley of Gwangi, or The Beast of Hollow Mountain, included in the 4-pack rather than Mothra, but Mothra is a classic. Very happy with my purchase.",1506816000,3,586,4.485981308411215

6161848,5,B00HFWETZ8,4 awesome creature features of sci-fi which are sure to entertain any monstergoer fan of the genre like myself - I found the transfers amazing considering the age of these films with great storylines featuring plots and twists and character build up leading up to the monster being revealed. While not Academy Award type films these films deliver the monster rave entertainment that was rampant back in the 50's and 60's which thrilled fans in every movie theatre which had you glued to your seat.,1492992000,,497,4.858823529411764

6161859,4,B00HFWETZ8,"I bought this in a lark because for $5.99 can you really go wrong.  I was really impressed with the video quality in these movies.  I thought I'd be getting damaged ripped copies of the movies but, no, the picture quality was clean.  No scratches in the video like you sometimes see.  The movies themselves are all B pictures of varying quality.  Sure, Mothra and It Came From Beneath the Sea are clas movies and 20 million miles to Earth is watchable but the Giant Claw is a bad movie but you can laugh at it.  I only wish the Giant Behemoth was substituted in for the Giant Claw.  If you grew up on these movies this is a DVD to have",1486166400,,635,4.155737704918033

6161863,4,B00HFWETZ8,"This incredible DVD, comprising a collection of 50's sci-fi movies, was a dream come true for me, particularly for one of the four films preserved on it.  This movie is ""The Giant Claw,"" from 1957.  I first saw it in a New Hampshire movie house in that year, as part of a summer camp outing.  The film deals with a huge, vulture-like bird that flies all over the world, wreaking havoc.  While a familiar theme in that era, what distinguishes this film is that the special effects are so poor, that they are hilarious, particularly the bird itself.  The producer, Sam Katzman, sought to have effects done at the most minimal of cost, and had them completed by an unknown firm in Mexico (sorry about that, Mr. Trump!).  The marionette bird employed can be seen suspended on strings, attacking an HO gauge train, in one landmark scene.  To save film,  the effects artists did not even bother to shoot in slow motion, usually needed to provide a convincing sense of reality when miniature photography is employed.  This particular scene evoked hysterical laughter from the audience- certainly not what was intended, and is even funnier now.  An excellent website entry  regarding this film says that the male star of the movie, which was completed in only two weeks, never saw these effects until he attended the film's premiere, and then rushed from the theatre, trying to be incognito, as he recognized how poor this film turned out.  The female lead apparently was a Playboy Bunny, though us pre-teens were not aware of that distinction in 1957!  If you like to be entertained by films that are so threadbare as to be funny,  or as in the Ray Harryhausen films, represent clever stop-motion animation of the monster,  don't hesitate to buy this collection, which I picked up on Amazon for about FIVE BUCKS!  Allowing for inflation since 1957, that's probably less expensive than the original prices of admission.  Superb, razor-sharp transfers with hardly a scratch on any of the films.

It is watchable on my 1080 Vizio. What I had forgotten (my bad) is that 2 of the 4 films (20 Million Miles to Earth & It Came From Beneath The Sea) are on the Ray Harryhausen box set (which I own) in much better quality. The Claw was amusing, & worth the $5 bucks by itself. I am not a fan of Asian sci-fi, so Mothra didn't do a thing for me.

If you don't have the Harryhausen box, & if you are ok with a low bit rate for a low price, this is an entertaining 3 film watch.",1446508800,2,646,3.857142857142857

comes on it's just 4 photos of the movies and you can select which one you want to watch. I am not even going to say anything
about Mothra and no I don't hate it I already have the uncut Japanese version on another set from SONY I bought along with the H-man.

6161983,4,B00HFWETZ8,"Four interesting sci-fi films, although only one can actually be considered a ""classic"" and even then under truncated circumstances.  ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" is a rudimentary monster film while ""20,000 Million Miles to Earth"" is awful on every level but for its special effects, arguably the finest cinematic example of stop-motion by Ray Harryhausen.  ""The Giant Claw"" is a giant howl; if ever you're down plug this one in, it's a classic hoot with a memorable cast.  However, the budgets, talents and scope of all three combined cannot hope to match ""Mothra,"" perhaps the centerpiece of Toho's magical monster movies.  Director Ishiro Honda does a marvelous job with a stellar cast and tremendous special effects by the legendary Eiji Tsuburaya.  This is of course the dubbed Columbia version which is at least full-screen with wonderful color.  The picture quality of all four is great and a tremendous deal for the price.

6162025,4,B00HFWETZ8,"Let's start off by saying that I am not a Mothra fan, so for me the set is for the other three movies. The four stars has nothing to do with Mothra being a part of the set, I knew what was on it, when I purchased it.

20 Millions Miles to Earth was better than I remembered, though as pointed out,the image on the box states that it is in color. The movie is in Black and White. So, I only gave the set 4 stars due to the misleading cover. The story is well done for the period it is from. I happen to enjoy those old sci-fi creature films. As an added bonus, this is a stop motion animation film by Ray Harryhausen. There is a great scene with the monster fighting an elephant all done with stop motion special effects, all Ray Harryhausen. This movie alone goes for around $12 and up on dvd, blu-ray is probably more. So, for the price of the set, you are getting this movie and 3 others. Not a bad deal. This movie as well as IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA can be found on the Ray Harryhausen gift set along with EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS! for around $30.  The story opens with a spaceship crashing into the ocean and a boy finding a canister lost by the ship on a beach. The story then becomes about what is in that canister and what it becomes. The havoc it creates, and more. A very entertaining movie. This movie alone is worth the price of the set.

The Giant Claw was a good sci-fi throw back to those old 50's films with a monster and a lot of panic. It's not as good as the Ray Harryhausen films but it is good non the less. The story is solid and the acting is solid as well. The giant claw belongs to a giant creature who as you guessed wrecks havoc and threatens the world.

My only disappointment with this set is that all 4 movies are stuffed onto one dvd. The visual and audio quality of the movies is great, which I have to admit I did not expect with so much crammed onto one disc. But, I feel that they could have been placed on 4 or even two dvds. The Ray Harryhausen set that goes for $30 uses separate dvds' for each movie. Funnily the quality is the same.

IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is a sci-fi movie about a giant octopus and the havoc it creates, also Ray Harryhausen special effects. Well written, well acted, and well done in general. There is romance, Science Fiction, action and drama.

Mothra, was the final entry in this set, this is the first appearance of Mothra. The movie is watchable, the story is solid, though most of the movie Mothra is in the larval stage he only turns into a moth during the last half hour of the movie. Like I said, I am not a Mothra fan, but the movie was better than most Mothra films that followed.

Do, I recommend this set? Yes, definitely, I believe it is a great addition to any collection if you don't already own the movies in one form or another, or if you just want to see one movie on this set that you don't already own.

(popped in coconut oil--yum!) and perhaps a box of some Milk Duds candy chews..well, I was in paradise.  There was usually a
news reel (I can remember Truman in Korea), a travel log short and on Saturdays perhaps a couple of cartoons (hopefully Warner
Bros cartoons.  This set brings back memories of those ""good old days"" especially the low cost of the entertainment.  I loved Sci Fi
or monster movies and this set has several of my favorites on it.  The quality of the images is superb,,much like a pristine print, and
two are Ray Harryhausen  masterpieces and he had quite a number of low budget but high quality production values films that made them very enjoyable.  I love stop motion animation and Harryhausen was one of the best, learning from such a master as O'Brian who did KING KONG.  Later R.H. would get bigger budgets but the quality remained tops.
  The best of this set is 20 MILL. MILES TO EARTH & IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA.  The budgets were so squeezed on
the latter film that the octopus only had five tentacles.  And yes, there was Kenneth Tobey who appeared in quite a number of low
budget sci fi films, usually playing a military officer.  Tobey I thought was a good but underrated  character actor.
  The other two films are ok but not R.H. movies.  All in all, worthy of more than four stars so I gave it 5.  I think it is worth every
penny one would pay for this DVD.  There are other sets out there that are similar to this with classic sci fi movies.  I got this and
others like it from Amazon.  And yes, no Dr Sweets and the Mouth that roared, Martha!  Enjoy!  And MOTHRA is fun if not silly!",1410566400,62,1755,4.368421052631579

6162041,5,B00HFWETZ8,"Great collection of old B-movie scifi.  Story behind The Giant Claw is that the special effects was farmed out to a Mexican firm which dragged its feet, made excuses, and provided no previews while the release date approached.  When they finally delivered it was of course laughably hideous, but the filmmakers had no choice, they were out of time.  Anyway, that's their story, anyway, and they're sticking to it and it does seem plausible.  The story pretty much works, It's really only the special effects of Rattly-Bird that stinks.  I always thought Mothra was stupid...what was he going to do, wreck every shirt in your closet with giant mothholes?  20 Million Miles to Earth had a good story and some great Harryhausen work with a wonderfull setting at the Colliseum..thje biggest thing to happen in modern times there until Bruce Lee fought Chuck Norris.

This would not have been the deciding factor on whether or not I would have purchased this collection, but I did think it would be a nice bonus, so I was somewhat disappointed. It seems really careless to put this on the front. You would think someone from Mill Creek would have noticed.

6162055,3,B00HFWETZ8,"This is the first time that a Mill Creek product had me wondering who this movie pack might be marketed to? Serious Sci-Fi film buffs will have most, if not all of these releases in H-Def special editions, and would not stoop to buying these four films one one DVD in compressed format. Three of these four films are classics, so even people with smaller collections are going to want the best versions of these films available. I came to the conclusion that this set must be aimed at two sets of people. Aliens who have never seen sci-fi cinema at its' best, and children of movie collectors who don't want their super duper special hi-def editions ruined when little johnny smears his pb&j sandwich all over it, trying to get it into the DVD player. So I guess I can understand why Mill Creek might have put out this collection. I just hope that they don't keep putting these films out that are readily available in much better versions elsewhere. I know they have done this in 50 & 100 movie packs, but there are rarities mixed into those sets as well, unlike this one. Here are the synopsis of the four films included.

20 Million Miles to Earth

(1957) B&W Not Rated 1.85:1

On its way home from Venus, a U.S. Army rocket ship crashes into the sea off of Sicily leaving Colonel Calder the sole survivor... or so it seems. A sealed container is also recovered from the wreck, and when a zoologist and his granddaughter open it, the gelatinous mass inside escapes. Overnight, it grows into a horrific monster that has doubled in size. In desperation, Calder calls in the Army to help fight the monster, which has taken refuge atop the Coliseum in Rome. But it will take more than man's weapons to fight the evil forces of the unknown and save the world from destruction.
(BEWARE:On the front cover, this is advertised in color.....if you look on the back you can see it's actually the B&W version.)

The Giant Claw

(1957) B&W Not Rated 1.85:1

Global chaos erupts when an enormous bird from outer space ventures to Earth and begins killing scores of innocent bystanders in this awe-inspiring sci-fi thriller starring stunning Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow. Four times faster than sound, the bird is bigger than a battleship and surrounded by an invisible radar-resistant shield which repels existing destructive devices. Its a race against time for scientists Mitch MacAfee and Sally Caldwell to devise a weapon against this abominable creature before it obliterates the World. Can they do it? IS there enough time? See for yourself in this terrifying adventure of man against monstrosity.

It Came From Beneath the Sea

(1955) B&W Not Rated 1.85:1

In Ray Harryhausen's vintage sci-fi thriller, a giant, radioactive octopus makes the deadly mistake of attacking Navy Captain Pete Mathews' submarine, prompting the bold commander to pursue the monstrous beast across the Pacific Ocean before it attacks anyone else. But as the military races to develop a special torpedo that will penetrate the mutated octopus's brain and destroy it, the eight-armed monstrosity suddenly discovers how to survive on land, wreaking havoc first on the Golden Gate Bridge and then in the Embarcadero, sending the terrified citizens of San Francisco running for their lives.

Mothra

(1961) Color Not Rated 2.35:1

A science fiction classic! After an atomic blast, members of a Japanese expedition explore the heavily-radiated Infant Island. Much to their surprise, the scientists discover that life still exists there: two beautiful twin girls called Ailenas. Standing only six inches high, they are the guardians of Mothra, a sacred giant egg. Later, Nelson, one of the explorers whose avarice has gotten the best of him, returns to the island to kidnap the Ailenas with plans to exhibit them around the world. Nelson gets more then hes bargained for, however. The giant egg hatches into a larva which grows to tremendous size and wreaks havoc on downtown Tokyo. Soon the caterpillar metamorphoses into a gigantic moth which the entire Japanese armed forces cant stop. Will the Earth survive?
(NOTE: This is the English dubbed version with no subtitle option. Also it looked a little stretched out to me, but it could have just been my eyes........but this is a budget set.)

I did notice that all of these were Columbia films, or licensed through them, so Mill Creek must have had a deal with them to release these classics on their budget label for some reason. So, if you're one of the very few who have been unlucky enough to have never seen any of these classics, or if you have a curious pre-teen go ahead and pick this up. Otherwise you can safely skip it, as there is nothing new here that you wouldn't already have on a deluxe edition.",1400803200,26,4728,4.815043156596794

6162060,4,B00HFWETZ8,"I'd buy this collection if only for It Came From Beneath the Sea because that film was an eye-opener for me as a kid.  Faith Domergue's character was not just eye candy, she was a distinguished scientist who balanced a personal life and a professional one as a natural thing.  She was liked and respected as an equal by her male colleagues.  She did stuff!  She could choose what to do!  I had literally never seen that on the screen before.  I had no idea such a thing was even possible.  It sure wasn't true of any woman I knew personally.  I didn't know women could be respected that much in the professional world; in my experience not even teachers were treated that way.  Ms Domergue's character Lesley Joyce made an independent life for a woman seem doable as well as desirable - a life of the mind as well as the body.  So I say, show this movie to your young daughters and granddaughters and tell them why this movie is different.  They'll like the movie anyway - it's a cracking good sci fi thriller, and Ken Tobey is slyly funny.  The other movies are okay 50s sf entertainment, but this one is much more than that.",1397174400,44,1126,4.360576923076923

I love Mothra song and can almost sing it in Japanese.",1530576000,,362,4.507692307692308

8632536,3,B00HFWETZ8,Its a movie. No issue with it.,1529798400,,30,3.4285714285714284
8632537,5,B00HFWETZ8,"I didn't expect too much, as this was a bundled add on. However, this turned out to be decent transfers of two Harryhousen classics, Tsuburayas pre-Ultraman kaiju, and the awesomely goofy Giant Claw. Great for rainy Saturday afternoons.",1529712000,,236,5.2368421052631575
8632538,4,B00HFWETZ8,"Worth the money for The Giant Claw alone. With all the things that make the old monster movies fun, this one has a better script and better acting than you might expect. (And the FX are a lot of fun.)",1529625600,,200,4.025

8632540,5,B00HFWETZ8,"For around four bucks you get four good science fiction movies. I only watched Mothra so far but I have to say that the print looks great"" Im guessing the disc is dual layer to get this many movies on one disc. If your on a budget this is for you. I will add to my review as I watch the rest of the films",1529020800,,304,3.6923076923076925
