8284879,3,B001BTZV58,"I have the four main box sets of the amazingly excellent English ""Battlefield"" series, but had noticed some straggling single 'episode' discs on Amazon.  This ""War File"" entry has the same cover graphics as other entries which say ""Battlefield"" across the top, and I'm guessing it is some sort of descendant of the original ""Battlefield"" programs.  ""The Ardennes Offensive"" is a fine documentary, which uses computer graphic recreations, along with stock WW II footage and lots of details, but it's no ""Battlefield"".  Tim Pigott-Smith's narration is sorely missed on this program, for one thing.  In summation, this is a good documentary, but if you are a rabid fan of the 1994 TV series, you won't really get your fix here, I'm afraid.",1340323200,,736,5.008196721311475
