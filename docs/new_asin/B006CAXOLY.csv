8496418,5,B006CAXOLY,"Flamenco is a form of dance, music, and song commonly associated with Andalucia in Southern Spain.  Its roots are believed to be from Rejesthan in northwest India, from which Gypsies (Roma) migrated during the 9th - 14th centuries. The intermingling of Gypsy music with that of the Sepharadic and Moorish Jews produced the flamenco art as we know it today.  Antonio Gades, through his ingenious choreographic direction, made flamenco a sophisticated and expandable art form.
The Suite Flamenca is an interesting compilation of solo and ensemble choreography. The dancers movement is so captivating that it can be presented on a totally bare stage, with no props or even background. The only stage effect is a very clever illumination permitting the easy entrance and disappearance of dancers.
The real jewel of this Blu-Ray disc is Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding), based on a play by Federica Garcia Lorca. Gades tells the play story with flamenco movement and music (mostly a few singers and guitar) in a very compelling way.  The most striking scene is Duelo y Muerte (Duel and Death), which is done with no music at all, just movement. An amazing creation and performance!
The sound and image of the disc are excellent overall, as is the background information included with it.
I highly recommend this to those who are already familiar with flamenco, and to those who want to watch it for the first time",1419552000,4,1407,4.953389830508475

8496420,4,B006CAXOLY,"I've been looking for a copy of the video Boda de Sangre that I used to have on VHS, but this is not it.  That video started with the dancers getting ready to rehearse, then it moved to the rehearsal.  As you watched the rehearsal come together, slowly you realized you were seeing the entire ballet and you were pulled into the story.  The whole thing takes place in the rehearsal hall, up close so that you can see movements, facial expressions, all the beauty of the ballet flamenco.  This DVD version is just a camera set at the back of the theater and the dancers are an inch high on the stage most of the time.  I give it four stars because it's still a magnificent ballet, but it's not the one I wanted.  I have been looking for years, and I guess I'll go on looking.",1370908800,11,774,4.195945945945946
8496421,5,B006CAXOLY,"This is the third purchase for me of the very exciting series of three flamenco dominated ballets created by Gades and performed at Madrid as the 75th anniversary birthday tribute to Gades. By chance, the sequence of my purchases has helped me to get to grips with the concept of this extraordinary type of dance/drama and this may be of interest to potential purchasers who, like me, are unfamiliar with Gades's creations.

Carmen was for me a useful starting point as I was already familiar with the story. In very broad outline this represents the middle period of Gades and dates from 1983. What I had not anticipated was the extraordinary degree to which this example of the flamenco art is able to extend the rawness of the emotional impact to an almost frightening degree. I followed this with Fuenteovejuna, dating from1994, and his final creation. This was a more concentrated development of the Carmen piece in every way and could be described as his most mature work. This current disc is a dramatic step back to his earliest work, Suite Flamenca from1968, and Bodas de Sangre from 1974.

Some background may be of help at this stage: Gades, as a young man, studied classical dance as well as all the Spanish popular dance idioms. This dual interest and skill enabled him, uniquely, to fuse together the two art forms of ballet and flamenco. He believed that flamenco must also be shorn of all extraneous distractions in order to bring the essence of the dance to light. At this early stage he was also providing the choreography for classical ballet such as Bolero, Carmen and El Amor Brujo for companies such as La Scala. From 1981 he formed the collaboration with Carlos Saura, the film director, which resulted in some of his flamenco-based creations being filmed. These films had an enormous effect on ballet companies around the world and Gades became very influential in this way while continuing as a ballet dancer in Giselle for example.

The Suite Flamenca is a 68 minute set of tightly choreographed and stylised flamenco-derived dances ranging from single dancers to larger groups. The complexity of the extended dancing, with changing rhythms and pacing is performed with amazing precision. However, as there is no story to hold the attention, I personally found this interesting, even amazing, but not ultimately gripping. The dances with the larger groups were of more interest to me because they contained greater obvious variety than those with single or paired dancers. However, this is a style that Gades quickly abandoned in favour of more dramatic story-based work.

The first of these creations was the 45 minute ballet Bodas de Sangre, (Blood Wedding), written in 1974 and later turned into a very successful film. This proved to be ground breaking and it still is a breath-taking piece. It is a dramatic combination of flamenco dance coupled with Bodes's expertise as a trained classical ballet dancer as described in paragraph 3 above. The dance is extremely stylised and used to portray a story which is dramatic to say the least. Everything is pared down to bare essentials. Costumes are plain, the staging is minimal, the lighting is boldly dramatic with use of spotlighting contrasted with dark areas and the music is restricted to guitar, minimal singing plus percussive clapping and foot tapping. Movements are stark. The final 12 minutes, a quarter of the ballet, features the concluding knife fight performed in ultra-slow mime and in complete silence. This defies description and is totally without any parallel in my experience. Its dramatic impact is light years on from the Suite Flamenco and makes this a `must purchase' situation on its own. I will not divulge the conclusion of the fight - you will need to buy this to find out - but it will be worth it!

The two `creations' are described by members of the team in general terms. The booklet is informative and interesting. The recording provides crisp and detailed camera work which is outstanding in its quality of imaging. The sound is completely excellent in DTS-HD and stereo. The whole range of sounds, those of guitars, singing, castanets, clapping and foot actions, are all brought vividly to life. I would have liked subtitles to help with the singing. Are these simply emotional sound effects or words or a combination of the two? They are obviously vital to the performers but their precise meaning escaped me.

In summary therefore, this is an artistic statement beyond any of my previous alternative musical or dramatic experiences and I found it to be another gripping Gades experience. I cannot see any reason to deny this the full 5 stars. Anything less would be my fault for failing to comprehend fully or properly. I personally would highly recommend this issue as unforgettable and an essential guide to a uniquely dramatic art form.",1341878400,13,4854,4.942401960784314
