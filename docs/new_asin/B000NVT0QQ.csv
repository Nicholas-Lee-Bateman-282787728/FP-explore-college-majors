2785734,5,B000NVT0QQ,"We get some major developments again this time around, and a couple of fairly dark episodes involving Charles and Ray. Renton gets a tad overemotional I think, but we see some major growth as he demonstrates his resolve several times when it comes to Eureka. We also get some significant bits from Eurekas past and a number of questions about her answered. All in all this is a pretty important volume.

The technical merits are still pretty good, though I did notice a minor drop in the animation quality I believe. It's not always noticeable, and I'm not even certain of it now, but I noticed something so I'm inclined to believe the drop is real. However, since I really need to look and think about it so much really indicates it's not a huge deal, and the voices, art and music continue to hold strong. Ken-Goh did sadly get a voice change in the dub as the actor who played him died during the production; he is a minor character though with only a few lines per disc so the effect is minimal.

I'm really looking forward to seeing what the next volume brings, although I dread that we're reaching the point the story is going to really kick in and there will be dark days ahead.

This one is packaged with a nice green t-shirt in size large with a small skyfish printed on the upper back and some text in a foreign language(presumably Japanese) on the front. Based on what Bandai Entertainment stated to a friend of mine, the text written on the front means ""skyfish"". The manga again disappoints compared to what the series presents in terms of characters and style, but it's still an okay read. The second soundtrack is also contained in this volume which has a number of slower or sadder songs and some of the more impressive tunes in the series as well. Unfortunately, at least for me, the second disc is all the random techno in the series and is pretty forgettable.

This volume also comes with the second artbox for the second half of the series. The artwork is pretty similar to the first artbox, although the focus is more on individual characters with the artwork. Unfortunately this also means the box may be prone to damage of the thin cardboard that the top portion wraps around to connect to the bottom portion, so handle that with care.",1209254400,,2258,4.526960784313726
2785735,5,B000NVT0QQ,"As for this box set, the soundtrack is really good as to be expected, and I love my shirt with ""skyfish"" on the front and a picture of one on the back.  The following is a repost of my review on the non-special edition dvd.

This series has been amazing, and I've enjoyed watching every episode so far. This volume begins a new story arc immediately after Renton returns to the Gekko in Episode #26, ""Morning Glory"".

The action is intense in episodes 27 and 28 when we see the crew of the Gekko take their stand in order to protect Renton and Eureka from Charles and Ray Beams. The dialog in those two episodes also brings out the differences between Charles Beams and Holland as well as the divergence in the choices they made years ago.

In Episode #29, we see Renton and Eureka attempt to keep on moving and interact with the crew in such a way that it keeps people on the ship moving forward. Toward the end, things are mentioned that explain to Renton why things are the way they are and why Gekkostate exists. Even though there isn't any action in #29 or #30, these two episodes display one of the greatest strengths of this series, the incredible dialog and character development.

There's one other point that makes this series really stand out as a whole and the thirtieth episode, ""Change of Life"", in particular. This is a series with great animation, action, music, dialog, and character development. There's something more however. This is one that will make the viewer think, and may even inspire the viewer. To this end, I will leave the reader of this review with this experience.

Sunday, December 9, 2007 I was responsible for the Communion meditation at church. I had shortened Eureka's quote, ""It's alright for you(Nirvash) to change too, just like me."" to simply ""It's alright to change."" That evening I was a little late to the meal preceding the worship service because I had it in mind to watch the last ten minutes of ""Change of Life"", and then I began typing my Communion meditation. The meditation was centered around the idea that Christianity is a dynamic religion and I detailed scriptural stories that recounted people who were changed by their encounters with Christ, and I mentioned how Christ's sacrifice entailed a very change in the way that people were able to encounter God. I mentioned that when we take Communion we remember the sacrifice that gives us reason to change our lives and that enables us to be changed by the Holy Spirit. What amazed me was the sermon in which the pastor focused on being willing to change and be changed in order to grow in our faith. He and I do not normally cooridinate the sermon and Communion meditation, and we did not that evening. Afterward, he asked me how long that I had worked on the piece for that night, and I admitted that it was the reason I was running a little late getting there for the meal prior to the service. He commented that it doesn't happen often, but sometimes, something happens in a service, and when it does, you just know that you've been impacted by the Holy Spirit. Yes, that night was one of those nights, and it was really cool to see a television series about a girl and her robot play its part.

To recap, Eureka Seven is a rare gem of a television broadcast series regardless of genre, nation of origin, target audience, etc. It has breathtaking scenery and action. The characters are the kind the viewer will identify with and attach to. The dialog and story are heartfelt and can be inspirational. Just remember that it's okay to stand by the ones you love like Renton does, and just remember, that like Eureka and the Nirvash, ""It's alright to change.""",1197331200,3,3665,4.586259541984733

2785737,5,B000NVT0QQ,"In Eureka Seven Volume 7 you will get four terrific episodes of the show. Specifically, these are episodes 27 to 30. The first two focus on the battle between Charles and Ray Beams, while the other two center on rest and repairs. The episodes can be watched in English or Japanese with english subtitles. If you haven't watched the first 26 episodes of this show, don't expect to understand the following summary:

Now that Renton is back aboard the Gekko, he and Eureka are happy...until Charles and Ray Beams attack. The two vow revenge on Holland and hope to also ""save"" Renton. Everyone is on edge as the climactic struggle that will either way have tragic results begins.

Holland is able to kill Charles, but is wounded in the battle. Ray escapes leaving a greif stricken Renton at least a bit relieved...until she returns. A second battle sees the end of Ray, but Holland is again injured and needs blood from Renton to be saved. This infuriates Talho because Renton has his sister's blood too. Still, Renton saves Holland.

The pair of Charles and Ray are perhaps two of this show's most tragic characters. Not being able to have children of their own thanks to the Summer of Love, they hoped Renton could fill the gap in their hearts. At least they find peace in death. Renton's reacton to the whole situation is also very emotional. The first two episodes leave you happy that the Gekko triumphed, but it was bitter sweet indeed.

The next episode sees the truth about Eureka revealed. She is in fact a human shaped coralian! The Gekkostate was only formed to protect her. While this revelation is indeed important, this episodes other story steals the show. Dominic visits Axel Thurston and learns about the deep level of kindness humans are sometimes willing to show to complete strangers.

In the last episode, the Gekko and Nirvash are in desperate need of repairs. They head to the Tressior research facility to rest and make repairs. There, Renton meets new acquaintances who knew Eureka, and his grandfather. Most importantly, Eureka and Talho make some changes of life.

Overall four emotional and wonderful episodes of the show. This special edition also comes with manga volume 5, a shirt, a collectible box, and a cd. The price is well worth it and this is a great buy for any anime or Eureka Seven fan.",1181260800,,2324,4.74009900990099
