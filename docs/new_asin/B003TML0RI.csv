4190858,5,B003TML0RI,"The reason for the name change, they are still called Only Men Aloud (OMA) in the Uk (wales !!), is so not to upset some gender groups in the US. So its ""Men Aloud"" in USA, ""Only Men Aloud"" rest of the world.
I have not seen this promotional CD yet, not released in UK. (Have to get a copy off TRE.) They have released two full CD's and are working on a third as ""Only Men Aloud""
I suggest you search Youtube for videos of ""Only Boys aloud"" the latest choir created by Tim and OMA in three months. 200 boys (14-19 yo) sang three songs in public for first time live in front of 3000 people and national tv.
Totally sensational!!",1282867200,,627,4.105691056910569
4190859,5,B003TML0RI,"but am already a subscriber - had to have it after seeing the show - thanks amazon! these boys are amazing - can see why they won the BBC show/contest
last choir standing -",1282003200,,172,4.088235294117647
4190860,1,B003TML0RI,Why is there no listing of song titles for this MEN ALOUD disk?  I can't order without this info. pmm,1281657600,3,101,4.05
8405266,5,B003TML0RI,Great Music!,1421020800,,12,5.5
8405267,5,B003TML0RI,I listen to this on my ipad and my iphone as well as on the car stereo.  Always beautiful listening.,1392076800,,100,4.0
8405268,4,B003TML0RI,"Okay, so I've picked out the big guy in the back row (did the others think he needed to be ""hidden""?) as my favorite stud in the group.  They're all gorgeous, and the singing is good, too.  Not of earthshaking musical importance, but I use bits in my music classroom as the students learn to describe vocal timbre, singing styles, and such.  Bruyn Terfel appears once or twice in this, and it's always nice to hear him, but he doesn't really add much to the weight of the performance overall.",1387843200,,492,4.444444444444445
8405269,1,B003TML0RI,My fault. I mistook this DVD for the choir that was on 'Britain has Stars' or similar. The choir was ex-street kids formed into 'Only Men Aloud'. The one I received is bearable but only just. Not so much a preview but a scathing reminder about reading what you what correctly and not assuming!!,1350691200,,294,4.462962962962963
8405270,5,B003TML0RI,"Wonderful performance on the DVD, but I was disappointed that the track featuring Bonnie Tyler, ""Total Eclipse of The Heart"", is not featured on the DVD.  I do not have the CD, but the program notes for it does show this track.  I hope this will show up in future performances on DVD.",1301616000,,284,4.339622641509434
8405271,4,B003TML0RI,"Yes, this video delivered as expected, as regard the Welsh as the best singers per head on the planet ... good song choice, obviously some home pride there with the boys and some very good coordinations of stage show songs ... my only disappointment was the lack of 'history' and 'build up' as would have enjoyed some background as I believe these type of shows which are set in beautiful parts of the world, should platform themselves more ...

8405272,5,B003TML0RI,I caught a glimpse of this group on PBS. I was so happy to get a copy of the preformance for myself and others this Christmas.,1294012800,2,126,3.8846153846153846
8405273,5,B003TML0RI,"As a massive fan of OMA, I think this DVD is absolutely marvellous.  I especially liked it because I have seen them perform most of the numbers on stage.",1288656000,2,153,4.275862068965517
8405274,5,B003TML0RI,"I'm a big fan of this choir and their dvd is a great addition to the two
cds they have out - fantastic singers, great entertainment.",1287446400,,132,4.115384615384615
8405275,5,B003TML0RI,This DVD is a must for all fans of Only Men Aloud. So fantastic to actually see them perform. A great selection of music. Best male choir ever!!!,1285027200,,145,4.214285714285714
