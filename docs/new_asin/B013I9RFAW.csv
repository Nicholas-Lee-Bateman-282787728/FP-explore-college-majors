7365995,3,B013I9RFAW,I enjoyed the history of the carol but I did not think it was worth $20.  It is something that I will only watch the one time.  A better price would have been about $10.,1464048000,2,169,3.8
7365996,5,B013I9RFAW,"This is a 60 minute DVD that tells more than just the writing of Silent Night. It goes into the background of Joseph Mohr and Franz Gruber who joined together to create this beloved Christmas Carol- Gruber to write the music to Mohrs verse.
The actor Simon Callow is a very good guide, taking the viewer not only to the little church at Oberndorf but into Salzburg as well where we see Christmas markets and learn what life was like.

There are 45 minutes of extras that show Salzburg, videos of Silent Night, the Salzburg music festival.
The DVD has English subtitles for those who are hard of hearing.
Its a lovely exploration into the worlds most popular hymn.",1462233600,,663,4.571428571428571
