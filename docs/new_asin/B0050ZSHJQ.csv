I have found better DVDs, at far more reasonable prices and have also used online sources which have a far greater legitimacy than Mr. Banyans DVD.  Lastly; Mr. Banyans DVD is nothing shy of a self-promoting gimmick to get you to either take his online or onsite courses.",1384560000,,355,4.603174603174603
