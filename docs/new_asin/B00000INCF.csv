7910915,5,B00000INCF,"[Please see comments on the websites for Vols I and II.] The final three episodes of the nine are better yet. Blake and Lonsdale are more subdued, although he never quite creates a believable character. And given the  bikini she sports in the 9th episode, she does not need one! The whole show  is Mollie Sugden's still. Unlike in ""Are You Being Served"" in  which the laughs are equally stimulated by each member of the cast, only  her character really gets any--and her delivery is marvelous. But there is  only so much you can take, so perhaps it is just as well we have no more  episodes this time around. If the series had provided better foils like the  ones provided for the Bucket Woman in ""Keeping Up Appearances,""  things would have fared better. But still it is such a joy watching Sugden  do her stuff that I must thank Acorn Media for making this available.",942019200,3,869,4.519230769230769
