8037925,1,B00063MCA2,i gave this a low rating because it was difficult to watch.  story line very confusing.  did not rate either as costume drama as costumes were bland.  the male actors resembled one another too close further complicating an already confusing story.,1400457600,,247,4.975609756097561
