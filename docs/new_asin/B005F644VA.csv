8469654,5,B005F644VA,"I have twin 10 month old girls and this is the only thing that would allow me to get them to sit still long enough for me to run upstairs to fix a bottle and get them to drink it calmly.  They won't watch anything else.  This DVD is perfect because it has little skits that are about 5-6 minutes in length and each one has a catchy song.  Even adults will enjoy it!  I know every song by heart at this point because we watch it so much.  When the girls get really fussy I sometimes turn it on in the background and they calm down immediately.  Their favorite episode is the goats.  They give me a HUGE smile when the goat song starts.  We have Volume 2, too.  I wish they'd made more!",1386892800,,684,4.007407407407407
