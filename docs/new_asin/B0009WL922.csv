8068532,4,B0009WL922,"I have watched this, one section at a time, on YouTube, and am highly entertained by its unique look and style. David Tennant and David Morrissey make a great contentious pairing. The use of these specific pop tunes to move the narrative along is right up my alley. Watching David Tennant seated on the boardwalk, singing along to ""The Gambler"" while eating an ice cream cone and keeping time with his feet, is one of my all-time favorite cinematic moments. I would give this 5 stars if the actors were actually singing while being filmed (as J Depp et al did while filming Sweeney Todd) rather than lip syncing. Still, great entertainment in my book.",1419638400,4,651,4.6695652173913045
