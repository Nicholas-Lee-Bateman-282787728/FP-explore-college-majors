8597129,3,B00DSAUOD2,"Story wrong?  Hey it's Hollywood just make the story interesting and exciting.  Steve Ruddell (Jon Hall) is sent in by Washington to help Governor William Henry Harrison (James Seay) who would become a future president with his problems of trying to maintain the peace with the local Shawnee tribe.  Chief Tecumseh (Jay Silverheels TV's Tonto) has the best role in the movie as he struggles to restrain his brother Tenskwatawa, The Prophet from making war on the Americans.  On the verge of the War Of 1812 the British are trying to get the Shawnee on their side.  Tecumseh, a man of peace, with the help of friends Ruddell and Harrison he builds a Indian town of Tippecanoe.  When he leaves to convince the other ""Civilized Tribes"" to do the same, The Prophet (Michael Ansara) leads a failed attack and then burns Tippecanoe so no one can have it.  Entertaining flick for western fans.  Truth- Tecumseh sided with the British and wanted war with the Americans.  The town was called Prophetstown not Tippecanoe, the Battle was named because it took place near the Tippecanoe River. The Prophet did not burn the city, Harrison did.  There are other things too, but never let the facts get in the way of a good Hollywood story and Jay Silverheels shined in his performance.",1429660800,,1271,4.762557077625571
