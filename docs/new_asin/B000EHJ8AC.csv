8109697,5,B000EHJ8AC,Another great follow up video on Mountain Bike fundamental skills. There is some overlap in what is covered in their first video (with better instruction) but some new stuff as well.,1525737600,,182,4.903225806451613
8109698,4,B000EHJ8AC,"Inspiring well directed stimulus to get you out on your wheels. Good guide, techniques, well filmed, documented, and encouraging you to try new techniques.",1366848000,,155,5.5
8109699,5,B000EHJ8AC,"Great video. After about 10 years of mountain biking with several different instructors I learned a lot from watching the West Coast Style videos. Good instruction, easy to understand, good shots of the riders, well-made videos. Just what I needed to improve my riding and stay safe. Thanks!",1329782400,,291,5.083333333333333

8109701,3,B000EHJ8AC,This video does give you some pointers and is a good video for the money. There are plenty of better videos out there but most range in the $25 to $30 range.,1315440000,,157,3.9375
8109702,3,B000EHJ8AC,"I am not a fan of the style of post production editing and graphics employed in this series. If you want a solid instructional video for improving basic skills look into Dirt Schools production. Its about the best I have seen short of taking a class via ""Bike Skills"":) [...]",1304640000,,275,4.52
8109703,3,B000EHJ8AC,"This is a great video for those who are new to mountain biking.  I think the title should be ""mountain biking fundamentals"" not ""freeride fundamentals"".  I am not sure what I was expecting, but the video is very basic and does not contain much action footage.  This is a great video for beginners.",1233619200,3,297,4.566037735849057
8109704,5,B000EHJ8AC,"this video explains techniquest for braking, cornering, jumping...everything, and very well.  since i wanted to get better at whistler bike park, this video was perfect for me as i was already riding at a advanced level.  it helps you remember the fundamentals for going big, or going down steeps or over skinnies.  this is true north shore riding techniques and joan, daamian and eladeee brown are really great, so is ryan leech and shaums march.  this is a great video becuase it can help beginners as well as advanced riders.  i highly suggest it for taking your riding to the next level!",1160956800,5,591,4.754901960784314
8109705,5,B000EHJ8AC,"The instruction is clear, effective and totally non-intimidating. These films would have answered many of the skills questions I had on my mind as I progressed through beginning to advanced skills. They would certainly have helped my bike handling skills keep pace with the potential of my bikes!

What immediately struck me about the film was the quality of image composition and the wonderful color. This film was almost exclusively shot on the North Shore, Squamish, the Woodlot and Whistler. The beauty of these areas really shows. The transitions between segments were also artful and stylish which was a nice touch. I only wish they sold a soundtrack. The video features music from Digital Motion, Adonis Tsilimparis and features the hit song, ""G.L.S."" from Salme Dahlstrom.

From an instructional point of view this video is top-notch. Blows Ned Overend's video out of the water. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to take their riding to the next level.",1139011200,9,969,5.05
