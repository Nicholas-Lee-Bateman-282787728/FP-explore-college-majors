3955696,5,B002N5N5LG,One of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time!  I can't wait for more episodes!,1252713600,3,86,3.7777777777777777
3955697,4,B002N5N5LG,"This episode was funny.  It is clearly written by hollywood about hollywood, with alot of references to movies, and tv.  Particularly from the 80's.  I think it has the potential for being a great series.  Or falling flat by beating the same jokes and themes to death.

It has a Bill Murray, John Candy, Chevy Chase Movie from the 80's feeling.  It does this with deliberate self mocking by labeling various moments with Movies reference.

I liked it. The cast is large so hopefully they will expand in possibilities of the various characters and situations and not let it become old in 3 episodes.",1252627200,4,598,4.6923076923076925

3955772,4,B002N5N5LG,"I love this show, especially how they jump between genres so seamlessly, and the characters are lovable misfits.  I will admit that it got better in the second and third seasons, with season three being the best, though the first season has some great episodes:

1. Pilot - The one that started it all.
5. Advanced Criminal Law - Alien Abed is hilarious.
10. Environmental Science - Helps establish the character's relationship to one another, and has the best rendition of ""Somewhere Out There"" I have ever heard, which is a favorite song of mine.
13. Investigative Journalism - Jack Black is always great!
14. Interpretive Dance - When Troy finally starts to shine: Going from a stereotypical jock to one of the best characters of the show.
17. Physical Education - Vampire Abed is amazing, and the strip billiards game is hilarious.
19. Beginner Pottery - The sailing class is great!
21. Contemporary American Poultry - Great Mofia-esk episode that really helps show the characters if they gained power, and also shows how smart Abed really is.
23. Modern Warfare - The most intense episode, which would make a great action movie.
24. English as a Second Language - Troy learns about his gift, and everyone actually ""learns"" Spanish.

If you've never seen the show, it is a comedy show, that occasionally homages different genres for hilarious effect.

Other shows that I find pretty similar: Psych, Malcolm in the Middle, Scrubs, Rick and Morty.  If you love any of these shows, you'll enjoy Community.",1468368000,2,1506,4.890196078431373

3955919,5,B002N5N5LG,"Community is a television show about a misfit study group attending Greendale Community College. It was an NBC show, which lasted has six seasons and had a turbulent production. The shows creator had been fired and rehired, and has had many seasons with poor ratings, to the point of cancellation. However, the shows first three seasons established that it is a sitcom that breaks the mold of sitcoms, beyond just the witty repartee. It also has meta self-commentary on the format of sitcoms, poking fun at itself and its competitors, making it relatable, despite its low turnout.
 The main cast is somewhat culturally diverse and includes comedy legend Chevy Chase. The rest of the cast is rounded out by Alison Brie, Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Donald Glover, Danny Pudi, and Yvette Nicole Brown. Chevy Chase plays Pierce Hawthorne, the outdated racist megalomaniac heir to a wet-wipe company. Alison Brie plays Annie Edison, an over-achieving ex-addict who dropped out of high school. Joel McHale plays Jeff Winger, a fraudulent lawyer who is now attending college to get his legitimate degree. Gillian Jacobs plays Britta Perry, a twenty-something who claims to have higher morals, but is herself a reprehensible person. Donald Glover plays Troy Barnes, a once-promising football star who is now exploring his nerdy side. Danny Pudi played Abed Nadir, a socially awkward film-enthusiast who possibly has some disorder. Yvette Nicole Brown plays Shirley Bennett, a mother of two who has been recently separated from her husband.
 While the cast is diverse in comedic skill, none of them are hard to relate to, with each characters quirks being easily identifiable. The character Abed Nadir, for instance, is known to be a Muslim but is not defined by his religion. His character is relatable because of his rampant pop culture references and otherwise nerdy behavior. Another character, Troy Barnes, was the prom king and star quarterback in his high school, but does not exhibit the typical jock behavior. Instead, frequently he shows his insecurities. While each characters different background influences their behavior it does not get in the way of showing them connect over the struggling through community college them. Within the show the characters refer to themselves as a family, and like many families they are functional and also dysfunctional.
The show finds its rhythm early on by pairing the characters differences against each other, with Jeff Winger frequently trying to manipulate the others in the study group. In one episode, Winger persuades everyone in the group to enroll in a class for an easy credit. Wingers plan backfires on him and he is on the verge of failing the class, but is bailed out by the group. The show, like many other shows, leaves you wondering will they, won't they with many of the characters romantic relationships, specifically between Jeff Winger and Britta Perry. The character development keeps the audience coming back and the shows sense of humor stops them from channel surfing. Many episodes will either make fun of the show itself or other shows with parodies and homages galore. And of course, in typical sitcom fashion, everything is neatly resolved by the end of each episode. For instance, one Halloween episode, the characters turned into zombies and ended with everyone cured and the government wiping everyones memories so that they did not remember the chaos.
Even though the show follows a basic formula that leads to each episode having some form of moral lesson, it does not become predictable in its presentation, and thus does not become boring. One Christmas episode centers around Abed learning to become independent from his family, but the episode is animated entirely in stop motion reminiscent of Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer. Another episode shows that while Jeff Winger usually falls into the role of the leader of the group, he does not always need to be there for them to have a good time, while also showing the consequences of a die roll with numerous parallel universes. Teamwork and trust is presented as a parody of spaghetti westerns with characters facing off against each other in a game of paintball in a different episode.  The show has an exciting flavor because of its unique recipe when approaching the sitcom genre.
 While the show had rave reviews, it failed to find its audience. It has an 8.6 out of 10 on the website IMDb. The first season premiere had 7.89 million viewers, but sharply dropped down to 4.41 million by the finale. This was a trend that continued with each following season, with the premieres having higher numbers and then steadily falling by the finale. To give you an example of what a successful shows rating are, another show, Bones, which aired on the same day and at the same time, had 10 million viewers throughout the season.
 Dan Harmon, the shows creator, was fired after the end of the third season, but then rehired for the fifth season due to the critical reviews dropping and demand from the fans during his absence in the fourth season. Harmon often was dangerously late with scripts and led a lifestyle even his friends describe as highly dysfunctional. Despite his wreckless behavior both on and off set, Harmons influence over the show is evident in the critical reception. In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #15 in the ""25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years,"" with high praise: ""The series' affinity for ambitious, high-concept story lines (e.g. few shows are willing to turn over an entire episode to stop-motion animation), meta humor, and constant pop culture allusions has helped it earn the kind of fervent fan following some of its higher-rated comedic competitors must envy.
 On May 9, 2014, NBC announced that it had canceled Community. Just as the cast contracts were about to expire, Yahoo! swooped in and ordered a sixth season. Yahoo! saw the potential for the show, despite its commercial failure, betting on its critical reception.",1447113600,,6003,5.022088353413655

3955929,5,B002N5N5LG,"Weird and wonderful, it actually starts out seeming pretty conventional in sit-com terms.  It then gradually shows its true genius as the plots begin to be peppered with both clever call-backs to previous episodes, astute and hilarious spoofs of popular cultural tropes and, finally, displaying some of the best comedic creations of its brilliant comedic cast.  With behind-the-scenes clips online revealing just how creatively funny everyone was (and is) and underlining some of the meta-references that one may have missed, it quickly reveals itself to be the singular comedy gem that has created so many rabid fans around the world.  Poorly promoted and programmed by the network, it is best appreciated in collections such as this.  I would recommend it to any intelligent comedy fan who has appreciation for spoofs, parodies and generally has affection for popular cultural references.  I'd also recommend it to everyone else, it will still be funny viewed from shallow perspectives. It's just good.",1437782400,3,1004,5.329113924050633

If you enjoy irreverent, witty, black humour, this season's Community is for you. These episodes are brilliantly produced, scripted and acted. Everything just gels beautifully together. It's just really hilarious, dark humour with a lot of heart - even despicable characters eg seor Chang, Pierce can't really be hated! There are some really magical moments in it that got me laughing so hard I'd start to cry! Then...they made series 2!! From the start of the second season, you begin to sense that something's not quite right. Then, by the 4th and 5th episodes it'll begin to dawn on you that the brilliance of series 1 is absent. It's almost as if the producers, writers etc felt they had proven themselves with the 1st series and had nothing to offer except for cheap, crude, cliched, brain dead humour eg Britta and Annie engaged in oil wrestling to raise funds, the study group trapped in a space flight simulator being towed away etc. Seriously? Do yourself a favour - watch series 1 and be thrilled and entertained, and then stop when you get to the season's end. The rest of the series don't measure up.",1423353600,,1269,4.7727272727272725

3956066,5,B002N5N5LG,"It is fair to say that among fans of Community, the first three seasons are the best. Since season three, we have seen the departure of Chevy Chase and Donald Glover from the main roster of characters, but also the return of Dan Harmon as creative director. In the first season, the early episodes display some differences from the later rhythm that has made the show a cult classic, but even in episode one it has an excellent sense of humor. The best quality of Community is its ability to produce humor at multiple levels, from a clear gag on Pierce's buffoonery to the much more subtle aspects of Troy and Abed's relationship. A few years ago, I watched one of the later episodes of Community and did not much care for it. More recently, however, I have started watching from the beginning (which is a must) and now love the show. While the show has gone through multiple cancellations and revivals, cast changes, and a host of writing staff, the thing that has been most consistent is the support of its fan base. I recommend anyone who wants to become part of that start here. Here's to six seasons and a movie!",1421625600,4,1117,4.5073891625615765

3956069,4,B002N5N5LG,"5+ stars for the production itself-- This was good, with memorable characters and nimble writing, more cleverly crafted than the typical ""quirky workplace sitcom"" (e.g. Scrubs, Parks & Rec, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, to give you an idea). Plus the cast was strong. It hit a snag by the end of the 3rd year and into the 4th, with a glut of contrived caper episodes and the Abed character devouring the show, later to turn increasingly baroque and self-serious and never quite to recover the original spirit. Anyway, forget about that: the first series is worth watching, with ""well-rounded"" stories and light-to-medium wackiness that grows on you. IMHO the sophomore season is even funnier and more gonzo but this has better consistency, combining a frivolous-seeming premise and ineffable charm for the Community dweebs and casual viewers alike.

Whether to get the disc instead of streaming or DVR'd re-runs is not so simple (unless you really love commentary tracks). The highlight of the  bonus features is a re-stitch of the drunk-dial episode adding 9 minutes from the work-print added (funny and explains a lot, perhaps in excess to the theme). Also included are two post-production bits, ""Cast Evaluations"" and ""Creative Compromises,"" which are meh; a manic outtake of Annie's & Pierce's scene at the piano; and copious blooper-style outtakes on each disc. The 90-second ""study break"" shorts are good, but recycled from elsewhere. Considering the mountain of art direction and web promotion behind this show, I wasn't impressed by the extras. There are minor video artifacts/de-interlace glitches, not in every episode, but you can see a clear example at 6:13 in the GoodFellas parody episode. The ""Pilot (Extended Cut)"" is the same as the streaming episode, using the full opening, not the shortened ""Three blocks from your home"" syndicated version-- except they actually dropped one of Alison Brie's lines (about ""Ivy League"" standards). Other episodes have minor dialogue cut out, ostensibly for ""DVD space constraints,"" e.g. a good John Oliver joke in the cafeteria, and the CSI/David Caruso goofing during the campus security bit. Yet there was room on there for a bunch of 5-year-old Sony movie trailers?

About the commentaries: each is a 3- or 4-person mix of cast/writers/directors, and a semi-prepared Dan Harmon. Didn't listen to all of these, but aside from Chevy Chase ones they're run-of-the-mill, dominated by shop talk like, ""It took us x # of hours to shoot this."" Harmon clearly enjoys the sound of his own voice, but the Stakhanovite attempt to comment during every one was a mistake. It's a shame he talks over the others, who are all bright people capable of being funny without his supervision but who may not wish to compete with a ragged showrunner not working off any notes. Expect half-baked rants, about ""Good Will Hunting"" or whatever, occasionally going on long past the scenes which provoked them.",1420588800,,2927,5.132075471698113

Of course, you have to suspend disbelief that this group would ever happen in real life -- although the creator says it is based on his experience at community college -- but it's not supposed to be a documentary.  It's a comedy that appeals to this mid-50's suburban 'hippie' (so my son says) housewife who also loves ""Friends"" and ""Big Bang Theory"" (and Survivor and Big Brother and Amazing Race).",1375574400,,517,4.670329670329671

3956339,5,B002N5N5LG,I remember I was first introduced to community when I was very sick and it provides a lot laughs. I feel in love with the show and let go of a lot of the stress I was under. Alison Brie was my favorite. I thought her character was cute. Joel Mchale comes off as a character hard to like but he plays it well enough you can see there is a good guy inside of him. Danny Pudi gives one if not the best acting performances. His character is not easy to play and becomes a series favorite. His character Abed is very into film and I can relate. I like to collect movies and talk about them. Chevy Chase best known for the Vacation movies makes a strong comeback here as a rich old man going to community college to fill his time and make some friends. His character is not likable but there are a lot of shades of the old Chevy Chase from the Vacation from the 80s movies not the one who faded away in the 90s. Donald Glover does a great job playing the ex football star who got injured and could not play football anymore thus fore fitting any scholarships given to him by colleges to play football. His character starts off to be a little full of myself and tries to act like he's a tough guy. Troy is really sensitive and Abed the character he makes fun of so much in the pilot ends up being his best friend. Glover and Pudi play great together as friends. Gillian Jacobs is another one of my favorites. I could identify with her as her character is my age and still deciding what to do with her life. College seems to be a good option for her. Jacobs is a smart character not easily to be fooled by Mchale and his elaborate plans to hook up with her. The two have a great relationship. They play off each other well but perhaps Britta's character change in Season 3 was best. It made her character more fun and Jacobs got to show off her talents showing two different sides of the character. I find Britta adorable and silly. Yvette Nicole Brown plays a mom returning to school. She is very religious. She is like a mother to the girls and also like one of them when gossiping. She clearly has a good heart and one of the more likable characters on the show. I highly recommend you tune into this show. The hardcore fans have prevented the show from being cancelled the past three seasons. There is a reason the show is still on. Community has a cult like following and perhaps not everyone will get the humor but I suggest you rent it from your local library and give it a try. Community has made me smile during some of the more trying times of my life. I hope it will do the same for you! Cheers!,1368489600,,2598,4.177290836653387

But every once in a while, I'll come upon a set which is so massively entertaining that I end up setting aside all other watchables so as to concentrate all my watching on just that one.

With Community, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  It had good reviews so I expected it would be somewhat watchable.

In the end, I watched all of the episodes within a weeks time.  (i.e. I couldn't put it down.)  Gearing up every night after work to absorb another 3 or 4 segments.  It was addictive.  And memorably funny.  I especially love the Senior Chang character.  LOL.",1367539200,,686,4.24031007751938

Each story is bold and goofy, with plenty of pop culture references and inside jokes. This show has a cult following for a reason, it is simply fantastic. It has failed to gain audience members because the humor builds on itself to an extant that requires watching the whole series. This set is a way to watch all of the episodes and pick up on humor otherwise passed over, a must for a fan of the series. I normally buy movies and TV shows used, but this series is an exception, I like it so much that I want the sales of DVDs to rise and help make the production more profitable, so I bought it new. I would recommend getting at least the first season to anyone, that way they can see if they like it.

The set is loaded with extras, and you can tell the creator put everything he had into the show (too bad he has been fired, watching his interviews on this set make you really sad for the guy).

This show is fast.  Very  fast.  You'll have to hold on to your remote to rewind some of the dialogue because the seven major characters complete for lines.

But back to Season 1:  I discovered ""Community"" with Season 3's Christmas special, which was clever, entertaining, and beautifully performed.  The rest of that year remained high quality.  Of course, I bought Seasons 1 and 2 the moment they came down in price.  Sadly, I found the first half of Season 1 to be mean spirited and a punishment to watch.  The second half of the season showed a mellowing, but was pretty lackluster.  The exception was ""Modern Warfare,"" a brilliant paintball-parody on war films.",1356480000,3,738,4.7936507936507935

3956563,5,B002N5N5LG,"Jeff Winger is a hotshot lawyer whose career has been brought to a screeching halt due to the slight problem of his qualifications being non-existent. He has to attend Greendale Community College for four years and pass a series of tests to regain his law credentials. An attempt to seduce a fellow student, Britta, by inviting her to a fictitious study group spirals out of control, resulting in the creation of a real study group. As the group goes through the school year, they learn and grow together. And also inadvertently create a copyright-infringing school anthem, give the college a guy in a gimp suit as its mascot and then almost destroy the place in a titanic paintball game that goes horrendously awry.

Community is entering its fourth season in the USA, but may be one of the best-kept secrets on television. Airing to mediocre ratings in the States and having almost no profile at all in the UK, it's nevertheless a funny, confident show which acts as both an obvious comedy and also something of a commentary on social dynamics and pop culture. The 'community' of the title is a reference to the central characters, who are all outcasts of one type of another, and their bonding together, and also to the wider college around them, personified through a recurring cast of tutors and other students.

Early episodes are mostly spent with the show trying to avoid cliches, with the character of Abed (Danny Pudi) always ready to compare an episode's storyline to something he saw on Friends or M*A*S*H*. This constant meta-commentary and attempts at ironic post-post-modernism are amusing but also slightly tiresome, with the show occasionally feeling a little smug with itself or else flailing at trying not to be caught between cliches. However, it's not long before the writers stop caring about that (at least quite so much) and instead concentrate on having fun. Community melds both the characters and the situations they encounter into compelling storylines that feel a lot longer than their modest 22 minutes-per-episode run times would suggest.

The actors are all excellent in their roles, particularly Joel McHale as Jeff, who has to make an inherently unlikable character likable without weakening the character, which he just about manages to do. The aforementioned Pudi is also great at portraying a character who initially appears to be the most predictable of the group but rapidly develops some interesting depths. Donald Glover takes the initially dull character of Troy and rapidly (by the end of episode two and its iconic Spanish rap number) turns him into a highlight of the show, thanks to some great comic timing. Yvette Nicole Brown's Shirley initially appears to be the 'mother' figure of the show, but some revelations about her personal life and gossipping tendencies turn that on its head. There's also a glorious cynicism about the character of Pearce (played by Chevy Chase, enjoying a career resurgence), a casually sexist and racist old man whose role in the group appears to primarily be making the other characters feel good about themselves. Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs round off the primary cast as Annie and Britta, who initially both seem fairly straightforward characters before gaining more layers as the season progresses.

Slightly less successful are the supporting characters, most notably Ken Jeong as 'Senor' Chang whose character is rather broad (more effectively in some episodes than others) and Jim Rash as the Dean, who random weirdness (he has a sexual predilection for people in dalmatian costumes) is wearying. Still, both have their strong moments as the season progresses.

After the first few, slightly more pedestrian episodes, the season takes an upward turn in quality, culminating in the now-legendary paintball episode, Modern Warfare, when the show's ingredients combine together to create something hilarious, mildly emotional and completely demented, leaving the viewer eager to see what the writers and cast can do in the second year.

Season 1 of Community (****) is well-written, sharply-acted and finely-observed, with more going on under the hood than you might expect from a situation comedy.",1348185600,,4183,5.144117647058824

3956587,5,B002N5N5LG,"I will admit that I am quite late to the Community party, I was only aware of the show a couple of months ago due to the fact that Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) is one of the starring actors. I am a big fan of Donald Glover's music and stand-ups, however as an actor I was a little bit skepticle. I came across the show on-demand not too long ago and I HAVE BEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE. This show is incredible from just about every aspect, the writing is top notch, the humor (while very silly) is neither corny or tries too hard, just about all the characters from the start are loveable, and the setting is very relatable to people around the ages of 18-27 as well as those who attend a community college. Season 1 is a great start, while the first couple of episodes don't exactly capture the characters true personalities just yet, the premise and the interactions between the characters are just laugh out loud all the way through. I guess the shows main theme is DIVERSITY, and how people of different cultures can come together, learn from one another, and befriend one another without succumbing to typical stereotypes. I love how the show incorporates racial satire, silly and sarcastic humor, and very outlandish situations to create such a genuine, fun show. While primarily a comedy show, there are also subtle touching moments that really contain deep moral values to them that it's hard not to love.

The DVD itself was great. 4 discs with a great amount of episodes (25 to be exact) with each and every episode accomodated with commentaries. Other extras include various outtakes of essentially every episode which are truly hilarious, some featurettes, alternate and deleted scenes, as well as mini-episodes. I am very impressed with how many extras they jampacked into this DVD. It is great to get a real taste of the creation and process of the show, and lucky for us, there many extras thatare at the consumers disposal. As far as modern television, I would rank this as my new #1 favorite show easily eclipsing The Big Bang Theory. I'm actually not really used to sitcoms that don't use laugh tracks, which can sometimes escalate humor, but also make it generic and annoying when its not a real audience. Community is just one of those shows that don't come around very often that I can personally find enjoyable from every single episode. I am looking forward to watching and purchasing the other seasons and future seasons (hopefully it will not be cancelled due to low ratings) Pick it UP!!!!!

No one stays the same and the love the share is visible in every scene.
The flanderization of the characters in season 3 made for just so much fun.

I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!! The characters are well written, three dimensional and all given the opportunity to 'shine' - even minor characters are the stuff of minor sitcome leads. The dialogue is bitingly witty, knowing and lightning quick and the plotlines are INSPIRED. I mean, who would think of turning a story about the inadequate supply of fried chicken into a goodfellas/means streets/the Godfather pastiche?

All this and series one is wrapped up in a top notch DVD set that includes mini episodes, outtakes, alternative scenes, producer's cuts, highlight reels, featurettes and commentaries with the cast and crew. A lot of care has also gone into the DVD sleeve design, which looks like a yearbook with comments from the characters - many other shows could learn a thing or two...

I have never been so riveted by a TV series. I have never found a TV series so hilarious. And I have never found a TV series so moving.

I suspect that in order for Community to have a similar type of effect on you, you must meet at least two criteria: (1) be between 20 and 35 years old, and (2) give your full attention to every nano-second of the show.

Re: (2): There is so much substance packed into every nano-second of the show that it demands your full attention to notice the subtleties and to understand exactly what the show's writers are trying to get at. You'll probably need/want to watch some episodes several times.

Re: (1): The first time I saw the show was at my parents' house, and while I was literally - not figuratively - screaming like an injured lemur with laughter, my Boomer parents barely managed a polite smile. The generational divide was never so apparent.

The show speaks directly to my generation, and not just to amuse us, but to tell us things we urgently need to hear. E.g.:

* ""Britta's attracted to men in emotional pain. It helps her think that she's emotionally healthy.""
* ""Jeff, you're a normal person. There's nothing very special about you at all. You're going to be great at a few things but really crappy at many more.""
* ""While claiming to have no religion, you're actually devoutly worshipping yourself.""
* ""We need more respect and less passion.""
* ""TV makes sense. It has structure, logic, rules, and likeable leading men. In life we have this. We have you.""

And there's so much more that isn't easily pick-up-able from little lines of dialogue. The general message of the show is (crudely) wake up, grow up, what's important is right in front of you.

God bless Dan Harmon. May he make many more TV shows.

Regarding Season 1 in particular, the least appealing episode is probably the first, when the series and characters are still flailing around trying to figure out who/what they're going to be.

3956646,5,B002N5N5LG,"COMMUNITY is undeniably streets ahead. If you want to know what the fuss is all about, and the furor and the hullabaloo, then you ought to give COMMUNITY a try. While the season's first half is mostly the show trying to get its sea legs - and so there are episodes which are a bit shaky - press on, sir, and you'll get to the turnaround. From the Christmas episode on, COMMUNITY picks up momentum and begins to consistently knock it out the park. Except, even before that, there were already glimmers of awesome. Like Troy and Abed's Spanish rap to close out the second episode (""Spanish 101"") or Vaughn's song, ""Gettin' Rid of Britta"" (""Home Economics""), or Abed dressed up as Batman in the Halloween episode (""Introduction to Statistics"").

Even though the show is about a, well, community of people of all ages and from all walks of life attending community college, our point-of-view character is initially Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a smug lawyer who was disallowed from plying his craft when the state bar learned that his law degree is from Colombia instead of Columbia. So he's forced to enroll in Greendale Community College. This show is as much about Jeff Winger's redemption from a shady counselor who is endlessly manipulative to a better human being (who, okay, is still pretty manipulative). Thru Jeff - who establishes a fake Spanish study group so that he can chat up pretty fellow student Britta (Jillian Jacobs) - we meet the rest of the diverse cast.

I like me the unapologetic snark, and COMMUNITY happens not only to shovel in the meta-references, it also parodies everything under the sun, and does it in sharp, wicked ways. But a sense of the ridiculous also infuses the stories, and I love that because I'm down with the goofy stuff as well. It all culminates in the funniest half-hour of television in 2010, the paintball episode ""Modern Warfare,"" a sublime send-up of the action/post-apocalyptic horror genre. This episode also escalates Jeff and Britta's ongoing flirtation to the next level.

I had never heard of any of the actors before, except for Chevy Chase but I warmed up to the cast soon enough. Donald Glover (""Troy"") and Danny Pudi (""Abed"") in particular just have this very cool chemistry, and they're very funny together. One of the things I look forward to are the closing credit tags which prominently feature Troy and Abed. And while I was on board with the Jeff/Britta thing, the show does throw an excellent plot swerve in the final episode. And the rabid Spanish 101 instructor, Se&ntilde;or Chang, is always good for chuckles. Heck, even Chevy Chase folds neatly into the group.

There are so many terrific episodes, but if I have to highlight a few... There's the Halloween episode ""Introduction to Statistics"" which has Chevy under the influence and introduces Jeff's hot statistics professor. And also ""Debate 109"" which pits indifferent debater Jeff against a charismatic disabled opponent. The Christmas episode smiles at re1igion and ends in a free-for-all, all-hands-on-deck scrap. Most of the episodes from then on are pretty gold, including most definitely ""Contemporary American Poultry,"" which satirizes gangster films like GOODFELLAS, and, of course, the awesomely awesome ""Modern Warfare."" The neat thing is that these actors are frequently called on to be silly and over-the-top, and yet they ground their performances enough that you do end up caring what happens to their characters. Except maybe for Se&ntilde;or Chang. Even Chevy Chase says he's abrasive.

The DVD set isn't stingy with the bonus features:

- Cast & Crew Commentary for each episode
- An Outtake Reel for each disc
- Alternate Scenes from the ""Advanced Criminal Law"" episode
- ""Creative Compromises"" - tongue-in-cheek featurette in which show creator Dan Harmon harps on about the creative changes the show's had to make to appease the network executives; oh, that poor Gillian Jacobs (00:02:52 minutes)
- ""Season One Cast Evaluations"" - Another not-to-be-taken-too-seriously featurette in which Dan Harmon sits each cast member down and evaluates their performances throughout the first season (00:11:41 minutes)
- 3 Mini-Episodes
- Season One Highlight Reel
- Extended Producer's Cut of the ""Communication Studies"" episode
- The DVD package also comes with the mini comic book, ""Kickpuncher,"" drawn by indie comic book artist Jim Mahfood and supposedly written by Troy Barnes",1328227200,2,4411,5.077241379310345

One episode, ""Communication Studies"", is presented in original and extended (by 9 minutes!) versions.  The commentary by the cast members and an assortment of creative and production staff really illuminate some of the more obscure elements of each episode (for example what Abed is doing in the hazy background of an episode from which he is otherwise absent).

3956673,3,B002N5N5LG,"Having just watched all of the first season of COMMUNITY, I thought I would jot off a quick review, that I think would have been very helpful to myself before purchasing this series.

I was swayed by the reviews which unfortunately had this being the best thing in the universe, with little to no moderating reviews. Having watched the series, I have to say while not horrible, I did have some problems, and in the scheme of things find myself far closer to the 2 star grades than the 5.

The show is not horrible. It has its moments, at times it's brilliant, one of the standout episodes being PAINTBALL.

And the cast has talented character actors, that could be interesting characters. Unfortunately by the time you get halfway through the season writer/creator Dan Harmon, has fallen into the rut of not developing most of the characters beyond stereotypes.

While I think he's trying to do something interesting with some of the characters, most notably the character of Abed played by Danny Pudi, who I think is great (Though I understand how Arabs may not really dig the idea of an Indian playing an Arab. Not an isolated incident in Hollywood). Unfortunately for every Abed it seems you also have to get a Troy.

Don't get me wrong, I like Donald Glover, but I think the character of Troy falls back into the happy medium of White writer writing weak or flawed or sexless or emasculated or non-threathening Black Male characters. You see that a lot in television, and hell going back to vaudville, writers working out their issues of fear and race through ""humor""/ridicule. But god we've seen that same tune sung so often, that it is a glaring, and boring, and uninteresting stereotype. I would rather a writer not have Black characters in the show, rather than drag the characters into the show to do his version of Step and fetchit. To bring characters of color in, only to break them down. Be it Buffy, or Smallville or the first season of the new Dr. Who, etc.

And the craziest thing is these writers think they are being edgy, and cutting edge, and original, and liberal, when what they are being is very predictable, very 1920s, very tired, and very bigoted. Note to Dan Harmon... tokenism... it is just what it sounds like.

The dumb over-compensating funny Black jock was just about passable the first half of the year, because at the very least you had the romantic subplot that gave you a hint there could be more there. But by the end of the season you have the dumb-over compensating funny Black Jock eunuch, which is oddly enough also a reoccurring Hollywood staple.

Nice one, Dan. Didn't see that coming.

It's just tired, tired writing.

I mean, and this is not to fault the actors, they do the best in the horrible stereotypes they are given to work in, and it's a testament to their skill that I like them, despite the limitations. But I'm nagged incessantly by the fact that I would like them a lot more if they were more than their foibles. I would like them a lot more if they had contrasting cool Black characters to play off of. It would be great the day Black characters can be represented by their ""Peirce"" but also have their ""Jeff"". Or have their  ""Shirley"" but also have their ""Britta"". Have the same diversity of quirky and cool characters that White actors get.

Unfortunately, that's what tokenism does, it gives only a narrow view, to a broad people. And usually it's the worst, most dismissive, most denigrating view possible. Which listening to Dan Harmon in the commentaries he comes across as more than a bit dismissive and denigrating.

All in all, by the end, I felt the show does a disservice to Harmon to write it, and it does a disservice to Glover to perform it. Add to this the character of Shirley (My God, is that a call back to ""what's happening?""!!) the sassy, but matronly, Black woman. My God we haven't seen that a thousand times. Black women seemingly to White writers in Hollywood, can only be perceived as Hors (ala Halle Berry) or as sassy, bossy matrons, but nothing in between.

Good, one Dan. Way to be original.

Let's try something new. How about something crazy, Black guy gets the girl. The hot Black, smart girl. Or the Hot White, smart girl. Wow, imagine that. Oh, wait... that would mean moving out of the 1920s.

So yeah by the end of the season, the blatant stereotyping, took away from what I thought was otherwise an interesting show.

I mean at the price it currently is of like $12 for the entire season, it's worth getting if only to see the paintball episode. Then sell the thing when done. You'll make out far cheaper than renting. But just realize, you're going to see something perhaps a little more flawed than Amazon reviews lets on. Grade: C+.",1322265600,3,4730,4.598574821852732

There are no weak characters in the ensemble, but the actress who plays Britta is by far the least talented, and occasionally makes me cringe with her obvious acting. Because of this, her character is the roughest sketch and does not always ring true. Had the actress who plays Annie been cast as Britta, her character would have surely been up with the rest. There have been a few bad arcs with Pierce going on a dark and mean streak that just is not funny or fun (Chevy Chase's acting is never the issue). But the rest of the show and cast is so strong, I happily sit through a few bad moments for one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. My favorite line so far is ""slurred speech"".

3956719,5,B002N5N5LG,"To save you time here are my favorite shows on TV last 3 years to show you what I am interested in.  Big Bang Theory, Chuck, Scrubs, Burn Notice, White Collar, ESPN...

As you can see I do not watch much TV so when I watch a show, it is good.  As my heading said, Community feels like the illegitimate child of Big Bang Theory and scrubs in college.

Synapse:  A group of unlikely community college students find themselves becoming good friends in an attempt to pass senior Changs Spanish class.  Jeff Winger the leader of the group is an ex-lawer trying not to get disbarred and go unnoticed in college while trying to ""get"" the girl.  Britta, jeffs object of affection in the beginning, is a feminist who really hasn't fought for anything.  Pierce (chevy Chase) is a retired business man who thinks going to college will make him young again.  Troy was the former star QB in highschool but after a keg stand injury he is trying to make the grade rather then make the team.  Annie is a secrete admirer of Troy who was known as Aderal Annie in Highschool.  Shirley is the mother of 2 and after a messy divorce is looking for a fresh start in college.  Finally Abed the non terrorist muslim film buff who has aspergers.  He knows everything about nearly every film ever made. This unlikely band finds adventure in their lives through their spanish study group and various chaotic community college events like campus wide paint ball games.

Heres the break down:

Characters:  The characters are unique, fun and deep.  Each one has something that makes them tick and adds something to the show.  Each episode builds slowly on previous ones in-terms of character development.  The characters are constantly evolving and coming to terms with their surroundings much like ""real people"" do.  Chevy Chases character can be a little annoying but eh, what you going to do its chevy :) 5/5

Comedy:  The episodes are slammed full of comedy.  It gives just the right amount of slap stick, situational and comedic antics throughout. 5/5

Plot:  Each episode albeit slowly, churns through the academic school year.  Plot lines a sewn deeper as the series progresses with each episode building off the last.  4.5/5

Acting:  The acting is very good from most cast.  Their are frequent cameos (much like Scrubs) that doesnt move the story along, but adds to the enjoyment of the experience.  4.5/5

replay value:  In my opinion I could watch episodes multiple times and have done so to show others how funny the show is.  5/5

Conclusion:

If your looking for a funny comedy that if you have ever been to college you might be able to relate to in some way or another.  This is probably the show for you.  If you are truly unsure if you will enjoy it.  Got to NBC.com and watch an episode online.

3956721,5,B002N5N5LG,"Since many reviewers have already covered many particular reasons to watch this show I will just put a summation:

  This is a very well done comedy series with a good blend of short ""easy"" jokes and more tongue in cheek ""witty"" jokes.  That the show is another one with an ensemble of characters comprising 7 regular characters and a small stable of recurring secondary characters appeals to many folks because it helps dispell the character in a vaccum that one gets with many series.  The show also has the appeal of not necessarily knowing what every episode is going to be about as soon as the starting premise is over in that one can't necessarily see the first five minutes and know without doubt exactly what each character is going to do by the end.  The ability for the writers of Community to surprise me as well as amuse with anything from a smirk to laughing out loud is what makes this one of the only shows worth making an effort to see for me.

  As far as this season is concerned as well as the forthcoming second season; that they are tv season dvds with 20+ well done episodes apiece both selling for $20 or less makes them an entertainment value that would be hard to find elsewhere.

3956722,5,B002N5N5LG,I just love this show. The cast is perfect from top to bottom and the writing is fast and clever. Any show that turns Chevy Chase into a comedic genius must be doing something right. This is probably the best comedy on TV right now. Not much more to say other than I just wanted to get the word out on what too many people are missing. Just look at the five star average here. Bring on Season 3!,1314576000,,395,4.012658227848101
3956723,5,B002N5N5LG,"This was an excellent price for a brand-new, still shrink-wrapped season of one of my favorite shows. It was shipped immediately and arrived promptly. The only problem was that two out of the four DVDs had slight manufacturing errors, which caused a little skipping, but i don't think that was the seller's fault.",1310601600,,313,4.9245283018867925
3956744,5,B002N5N5LG,"I bought this for my cousin for her birthday after we watched my own copy and both got hooked.

It shipped very quickly and was in excellent condition. The DVD itself has a few fun special features, though nothing astounding.

This show is funny and heartwarming without being cliched or saccharine. It's incredibly intelligently written for a network show. I'm a college student and pretty much everyone I know in my generation who has seen it loves it.

Basically, a white 30-something lawyer gets caught with a fake diploma and gets stuck in community college. There he joins a Spanish study group and gets stuck with a bunch of goobers. You'll recognize some actors from their other work, but everyone does an excellent job so there's no reason to judge the cast based on its most famous members.

Pros:
- Multiracial cast that isn't a bunch of stereotypes. After watching shows with all-white casts it was refreshing. The characters are of different races and come from different religious backgrounds, but it's handled in a way that isn't cliched or preachy or offensive.
- It's a genuinely funny show.
- If you're into self-aware or ""meta"" stuff, this is 100% up your alley.

Cons:
- The first few episodes start off somewhat slow. It takes the show a bit to find its footing and a couple of the characters (most notably Troy and Abed) change for the better after the first several episodes.
- It leaves you wanting so much more (is that really a con, though? haha)

I haven't seen season two (yet!), but I recommend this DVD 100%.",1310256000,,1538,4.698884758364312

Every time is character, Pierce, opens his mouth I ended up laughing until tears well up in my eyes.

3956747,5,B002N5N5LG,"""Community"" is a show about a group of loveable misfits who find themselves thrown together in a study group in what must be the world's worst community college. The main character, Jeff Winger, is a lawyer -- or was, until the Bar Association discovered that he had never received a bachelor's degree. He's now trying to get one as quickly, easily, and dishonestly as possible. The rest of the study group he unwittingly finds himself the leader of is made up of the usual community college clichs: An old guy who's gone back to school to feel young again, a middle-aged divorced mother, a 20-something slacker, an oddball film student, and a couple of recent high school graduates who blew their senior year (one a top athlete who injured himself doing a keg flip, the other an overachiever who spent the last semester in rehab for her Adderall addiction).

The oddball film student is my favorite. His name is Abed, and he's a half Palestinian, half Polish film and TV buff. He's believed to have Asperger's, and can only connect with people through pop culture references. (If you have a gimmick account on the AV Club, or you have ever referred to yourself as ""This Troper,"" you're going to love Abed.)

It took me about two or three episodes to really get into the show, but then I finally saw ""Community"" for the hilarious (at times even brilliant) show it is. In fact, I'm surprised it even took me that long. By coincidence, I started attending community college around the same time the series began. (I'm a veteran, recently separated from the military -- the one community college clich not represented on the show.) I was sitting in math class one day, when the older guy next to me nudged me and made a crude comment about a teenage girl in the front row. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

But anyway, personal asides... um... aside, ""Community"" combines wit and warmth in a way not seen since the classic era of ""The Simpsons."" And not since ""The Critic"" have I seen a show that can so seamlessly switch gears back and forth between heartfelt situational ""group of quirky friends"" comedy and hilarious film and TV parody (and sometimes managing both at the same time).

Once I caught on to ""Community,"" I was worried that it was too good to be true. I was afraid that it would catch on with the critics, but not the mainstream audience. Shows with high levels of intelligence and heart often don't last (shows like ""The Critic,"" ""Firefly,"" and ""Arrested Development""). Fortunately, it HAS caught on, and ""Community"" will be entering its 3rd season this fall. Unfortunately, now I fear that the show will be ruined in the opposite way -- that it will be dragged on far too long. Just think of how they kept ""MASH"" on the air a few years longer than they should have, what's currently happening to ""The Office,"" and how (sigh...) ""The Simpsons"" has been on for about 13 years (and counting) too long.

But hey, let's enjoy it while it lasts/before it jumps the shark!",1308960000,,2986,4.637051039697543

This show is definitely a breath of fresh air on TV and only contributes to the greatness that is NBC's Thursday night line-ups (30 Rock, Parks & Rec, The Office has climbed back from its melancholy).

This show continues to be ""original"" (or at least in my viewing experience its original) and funny. Its got some of the lesser known actors in Hollywood that are primed to make a splash in the next few years after getting noticed on this show. The characters are likeable and somewhat realistic with writers and actors that seem to go the extra mile in making you truly wish these were real people.

3956753,5,B002N5N5LG,"With Scrubs being finished and The Office in its 7th season, I was needing something new.  I'm a sitcom fan.  Seinfeld, Friends, Simpsons, IT Crowd, The office, Scrubs, and now the Community all sit on my shelf.  I don't think its because the Community being newer is why I like it the best.  I think its because it takes a style from everything that has worked before it and incorporated into something a little diverse.

The overall synopsis has been tried a thousand times... An unlikely and diverse group is forced together and nothing is as it seems.  But they do so much more than try to revitalize a century old idea.

The large cast is at the top of their game.  They work well together and no one really steals the show (which I think is a very good thing).  While Jeff is billed as the 'leader' he very heavily relies on EVERYONE and their story.  At any time someone could be left out or someone, anyone could be focused on and it would work for a time.

The story remembers itself.  Each episode isn't a new 20 minutes that start from scratch.  If someone broke their leg last week they are in a cast or limping the following week.  Its not like the Simpsons where they draw in a door slot when its convenient or they themselves joke about how the plots rarely remember or explain major previous events.  Every episode adds to the community cannon that will be drawn upon in the future.

The characters are aware of the outside world.  They can joke about politics, companies, religions, hollywood, etc.  The show is set in a real world which adds a layer of depth and comedy that some shows will avoid.  While Scrubs was a great show, it knew very little of what happened outside the hospital.  They brought in guest stars.. but as doctors or patients, rarely, if ever as themselves.

Soap Opera writing.  Seinfeld and Scrubs are my favorite examples of soap opera sit coms.  Everyone's story is important and will eventually intersect.  The intersection usually creates a pretty big laugh.  With Seinfeld, they mastered bringing everyone together in very unique and deep ways.  They went outside the box to get events like a golf ball, a beached whale, and a white lie about being a marine biologist together for side splitting laughter.  Scrubs took this mechanic and used it as a way to tell a story and make a meaningful point.  Every episode had a lesson and it was often told by comparing the different cast members situation.  They could make you laugh and cry in the same episode.  The Community does both and in its first season, they do it like a pro.  They also go in other directions that many would think would turn the show upside down.  The gangster chicken strip episode, the paint ball war zone, and the zombie episode all find ways to do the outrageous without ever leaving context.

The DVD contains features throughout.  One episode has an extended version that can be seen or you can choose to watch the original.  Every single episode has commentary.  There are deleted scenes, bloopers,  and a mix of featurettes.  Even the DVD casing is setup like a year book and each of the characters has left writing and well wishes over the other characters pictures and episode titles.  I was not expecting much from a first season DVD, but it actually ended up delivering more extras then... well, just about everything out there.

We all have our own personal preferences, so its hard to really ""RATE"" a TV show.  But in this case, its quite easy for me to do.  This show gets an A+ in every possible category.  They put so much work into the set, the characters, the writing, the plot, the atmosphere, even the DVD cover, that I have to let them graduate with honors.

As with most shows, there is concern about how 8 different college students will still be together 4 years from now.  But the writers have proven clever enough, that I'm content to rest my fears and enjoy each episode they deliver.",1303344000,13,3929,4.55793991416309
3956754,5,B002N5N5LG,"Though it took me a few episodes to understand the characters and the rhythm of the show, once I understood what was going on I feel in love.

Unlike other shows, Community never sacrifices their characters for the story. No matter how crazy the situation, these characters remain true to themselves. The honest portrayal allows the viewer to believe and invest in the most ridiculous of circumstances and never lose respect for the show.

Furthermore, this is a true DVD for the fans. Dan Harmon-creator, three to four cast members and a crew member have commentary on EVERY SINGLE episode. The fact that they took time to sit down and record the behind the scenes  style commentary speaks volumes to me.

Plus, there are bloopers on every disc. You don't have to wait to watch the bloopers after viewing all 25 episodes. Every six episodes or so, there is another 7 minute bloopers reel, each one funnier than the last.

Overall, this show is amazing and only continues to get better in season 2.

in the series and premise- basically that a community college will draw all types, ethnicities and age groups for various reasons and
it becomes a stew for forming odd clicks. There are thick cultural references that you have to watch for as part of the fun. The male lead
character forms a Spanish language study group to woo a standoffish blond, but finds uninvited others have decided to attend, and these
become the main cast. There are so many side plots it is a little hard to give an account of but it all adds up to viewing fun. I am looking

Character dynamics are hilarious and genuine, episodes are mostly unpredictable and I really like these characters. An episode can win on rapid fire wit, charm, wordplay, character resolution, romance, ridiculousness or even a nice moment. Community doesn't get the ratings that it should, but it does try harder than any comedy show. Paintball wars, Charlie Kaufman spoofs, zombies, animated, paradise and space rockets are all places they go. I think the variable in their show is the controlled awareness.

I can't remember the last show that had me laughing so much - consistanly!  The rapid-fire laughs and witty writing just never seemed to end as I marathoned my way through the first season.  If you've read this far then you probably already know the premise of the show so I won't go into that, also if you've read this far then stop wasting your time and just buy it!",1294704000,,472,4.164835164835165

3956831,5,B002N5N5LG,"I watched the Halloween episode of Community and thought to myself, ""There is no way in hell they will ever top this episode in terms of sheer awesomeness.""  Then they broadcast the Goodfellas parody.  Again I thought, ""Okay, they topped the Halloween episode, but there's no way they'll ever top this.""  Then they broadcast the paintball episode.

Community is arguably the best cast half-hour comedy series on television. Fantastic ensemble acting all around. The writing is sharp, relevant, and hilarious. And they trot in a steady stream of talented Hollywood feature film directors (Johnathan Lin and the Russo Brothers for example) to direct the episodes.

This show is criminally under-watched. If you're already a fan of Arrested Development or Always Sunny, go ahead and buy the whole first season.",1294531200,3,807,5.224806201550388
3956832,5,B002N5N5LG,"I was really surprised when I opened this dvd set. Even though I don't like slim dvd cases, the art of this Community box made me forget that. It is dressed as Jeff's Yearbook, with really funny notes from the main characters of the show. It also comes with an edition of the Kickpuncher, written by Troy, also amusing. Besides that, the dvds are full of extras, with extended episodes, outtakes and more. Something that I found interesting were the first season cast evaluations. I didn't have the opportunity to watch all of them, but simply the idea is, for me, genial!
As for the show, it surely is one of the best comedy series I have ever watched. However, not everybody will like it. I don't consider Community's humor as a universal humor. So, before buying it, make sure you watch one or two episodes and really like it. If you do, come to Amazon and buy this dvd set. You won't regret.",1294185600,,895,4.463414634146342

For those that purchase this, make sure to go back and watch/listen to the cast commentary on each episode.  I recommend this for all comedy dvd sets.  Listening to the cast and crew crack jokes at one another, and tell what went into making the episodes is a great bonus.

3956905,5,B002N5N5LG,"I should start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the series. But honestly, how can you not be? It's hilarious, heartfelt, sincere, and above all, innovative. So few shows have the ability to do pretty much whatever they want without letting down the audience, and Community's got boldness. In spades.

At first, the fast-paced delivery of joke after joke is reminiscent of Arrested Development, but in my opinion, Community bests the holy comedy in almost every way. Much like AD, there is no laugh track, and thank the holiest of holies that it doesn't. So much of its charm and comedic effectiveness comes from its rapid fire pace, and a laugh track would have a. gotten in the way and b. been a total buzzkill. The characters do and say hilarious things that should be appreciated on their own merit, and therefore don't need any assistance to remind the audience that THIS IS FUNNY.

Granted, the show doesn't start off perfect, but as the episodes progress, all the characters and the writing really come into their own. Every character is sympathetic, and in time become real three-dimensional people with real motivations and understandable dilemmas. Another brilliant aspect is its longevity. I've watched every episode at least 6 times, every time enjoying it and spotting new things I didn't catch before.

I cannot recommend this show highly enough, and this DVD box set makes for a great gift, and all of the extras/commentary wet my tv geek whistle. Especially recommended for fans of NBC's other magnum opus, 30 Rock.",1293494400,,1530,4.876923076923077

Each show has a cast and crew commentary, which I love, and some of those commentaries are quite hilarious. A definite pickup for any fan of the show.",1293494400,,386,4.676470588235294
3956908,5,B002N5N5LG,"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said, so I won't waste your time. Community is funny, but intelligent at the same time. What I love most about it, besides it's meta humor and parody episodes, is it's heart. There's just something warm about this show that's missing in a lot of other shows on television today. It's sorta like how the Simpsons used to be, but instead of using Springfield, they use Community College as jump off point to dive into some completely zaney yet brilliantly contrived plot.

Community also makes good use of the ensemble cast, similar to Friends in that it starts out focusing on one character (or in the case of friends, Ross&Rachel)but as it progresses, grows to encompass the whole group, each with their own storylines often happening at the same time. Conspiracy Theories/Blanket Forts, Mean Girls/Tranquility Trampoline, to name a few in recent episodes from season 2.

It points out a lot of truths in life in smart ways, (the bar episode, also season 2), and their special episodes (xmas/halloween) were both phenomenal. (Though if i had to pick last season would have to win hands down)

There's just so much to say about how awesome this show is, and i could go on and on, but plenty of people have already done it. So what are you waiting for? buy it.",1293494400,,1307,4.673913043478261

It's funny, watching a few episodes with commentary the writing / directing team totally acknowledges that they didn't know what they were doing with the show early on either.  But.... once this show found its direction, I'd say around the 5th or 6th episode it became one of the best shows (maybe the best comedy) on TV.  I absolutely love it, I can also go back to the early episodes that I thought were no good and see good in them.  Totally worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

The self referential humor is great, the casting is outstanding, and the scripting is fantastic. You haven't lived until you have watched the best ""couple"" on TV, Troy and Abed. This DVD would be worth the purchase just for their outro from each episode. In two years of watching this show now, it's only missed on two episodes. Fantastic brilliant comedy - give it a shot.

This episode has both.  Bravo writers of Community.  What makes me love this episode so much is the fact that such a racial diverse and religously scattered group of people could operate at this level.  The obvious refrences to iconic mafia realted movies actually takes a backseat to the true message this episode was trying to convay and that was one of a shift of power.  Although Ahbed's intelligence offered imideate benefits to the group in the end Jeff's intrinsitic leadership prevailed, albeit selfishly motivated.

So as the cast tries to get Ahbed to be a different person when picking up girls they do a practice run with Annie played by Alison Brie.  Alison Brie IS a character in Mad Men and Abed acts like Don Draper from Mad Men.  Not only is the irony of the scene impecable, but the acting is pristine.  Im going to give it up to Ahbed on his impersonation of Don Draper but Annie... wow.  When you watch this watch this watch her, she is excellent..her body language and reaction is amazing.  Abed's usage of the signature Don Draper Hook (its what I call it) when he curls his index finger and lodges it up underneath the chin to pull in the kiss......unstoppable.

COMMUNITY is a great show. It has a talented cast; the writers have a solid idea of who the characters are and why they're funny, and they're not afraid to spotlight that or to push the boundaries of the typical sitcom format.

The DVD set has commentaries on every episode, all of which are both entertaining and enlightening. The physical material of the set isn't extensive but the packaging shows the same attention to detail and marriage to the storylines of the series that the show's set designers and prop makers exhibit (a fact which is pointed out on the commentaries).",1292630400,,617,4.651376146788991

If that praise piques your interest, you owe it to yourself to check out this show. It's filled with fast-paced, intelligent humor and genius ad-libs. The plots are occasionally as goofy and surreal as you'd ever hope to see, and yet it somehow stays grounded and shows true heart.

As already noted by other reviewers, the DVDs themselves are also amazing. The Kickpuncher comic is a cute addition, and having commentary on every single episode is a very nice touch. Be sure to check out the outtakes on every disc- there's a lot of great improv here.",1291248000,3,751,4.7251908396946565
3956973,5,B002N5N5LG,"Community is one of those shows that some people grow into, but I loved it instantly. However, I dare anyone who doesn't like it at first to still not like it by the 3rd or 4th episode. I have had friends who just didn't get it and didn't like it at first, but by the 3rd episode they warmed up to it and now it is their absolute favorite show. To hear talk about it now, you'd never know they kind of hated the first episode. I didn't hate it... I don't hate any episode. They had a fantastic first season and watching these characters grow and find themselves makes for great television. Dan Harmon really knows what he's doing and he knows funny. You can also tell that everyone who works on the show loves the show and loves working with each other. Community actually has a lot of heart in it which I feel it doesn't get enough credit for. Amid the craziness and hilarity, there is a genuine sweetness with these characters. By the end of the season you will feel like they are a real family... and you might kind of feel like a part of that family too.

The video and audio is pretty standard for DVD (I wish they had released it on Blu-Ray), but the show still looks fantastic. Community has a very movie/film quality feel to it and that has a lot to do with the cameras they chose to use. I know this because of the commentaries.

This brings me to the extras. They really put effort into these extra. We have a commentary on every single episode! Dan Harmon, the creator of the show, is present for all of them and various actors, directors, and writers cycle through. All the commentaries are great to listen to and tell you a lot about the mood on the set and gives you insight into the mind of Dan Harmon. If you follow him on Twitter you probably already have a pretty good idea of that, though. When you listen to the cast you can just tell that these guys hang out when they're not working. They genuinely like each other and that comes across in the show.

After the commentaries we have outtakes on every disc from every episode! Again this is fantastic stuff because we get to see a lot of the improv stuff that Donald Glover and Danny Pudi perform that didn't make it into the episode. Then rounding out the top tier of the extras are the ""cast evaluations"" done by Dan Harmon and the so-hilarious-it-hurts ""Creative Compromises.""

I haven't bought a DVD or a DVD set since I started buying Blu-Rays and I told myself I would not buy anything unless it was on Blu. However there doesn't seem to be a push to get this on Blu so I made my one and only exception for Community. This show deserves to be on the air for a long time.",1291161600,,2646,4.264940239043825

I have grown up with many of them, cried over them, laughed at them, and, more than anything, have wanted to belong to them. It is clear from the beginning that the writers and creators of Community know exactly how I feel. In one of Jeff Winger's first lines (the pitch perfect Joel McHale) he mentions that he was raised by tv and Abed, a young guy with a passion for film and television that borders on obsession (who shows some traits common in Asperger's patients) often calls to attention the clichs that movies say would happen in whichever situation they are. The whole show is filled with inside jokes for us, like complaining about how characters on tv shows break the suspension of disbelief by remarking how much their lives resemble tv shows, or openly discussing shows which feature actors on Community. They use the TV formulas, like the will they - won't they sexual tensions, or the group of misfits who become a family, and mock them, while at the same time putting them into play. For all its references and parodies, Community never stops being entertaining.

I admit I may be biased due to the fact that the group of friends on the show sort of remind me of my misfit friends from college, not to mention the vibe at Greendale Community eerily resembles the one my now-defunct 4-year school did :) But I think anyone who likes funny will love Community.

Second are people who think this is a great show with impressive writing and a superb ensemble cast. The last group believes this program is the second coming of Arrested Development. I personally lean towards the third group but I hesitate in making that comparison at this time. Don't get me wrong. This is the funniest thing on TV due in large part to its creativeness and Joel McHale is a surprisingly good lead that you begin to empathize with over the course of the series (i.e. you will begin to care about him and how he relates to the people around him, which is surprising for a comedy). By the same token this series is still in its infancy and its hard for anyone to say this show will live up to the large shadow the genre's standard bearer has left.

After hearing about this show all year and reading the massive amounts of praise heaped on the show by my fellow Amazonians (almost 40 reviews and every single one of them are 5 stars?!), I'm left to wonder what all the fuss was about.  I watched the first two disks and had to drag myself through the last two just to see whether it got any more interesting, but it just didn't.  There were very few laugh out loud moments for me (the Forest Whitaker Eye bit cracked me up, I must admit), and it just seemed like the show was trying to be a bit too clever for its own good.

For all of that, I like the supporting cast.  Winger and Britta (the leads) are uniteresting, but Abed and Troy, along with Pierce and Dean Pelton are occasionally funny.  Seor Chang is the one character that consistently does it for me, and I look forward to whenever he appears.

Also, if you like the show, this set is a fantastic value for the money.  There are twenty+ episodes with commentary for each one (!!!), and a bunch of other special features.  All for less than $20??  You kidding?  Sign me up!  Or not, since I didn't care for the show, but I wish other box sets would follow this one's lead!

Count me as one that just can't buy into the hype.  Maybe I'll rent parts of the next season to check on its progress, but I won't hold my breath.  Frasier and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia don't do it for me either and they are/were much beloved, so maybe it's just a lack of taste on my part.",1286150400,36,1512,4.201388888888889

But im going to be completely honest, I hated this show when it first came on. Admittingly I only watched the first episode when it first came but out I flat out didn't like it. I just didn't see anything funny about it. But when i knew that the second season was coming up I put the whole first season on Netflix so i could catch up and BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!!! This is without a DOUBT the best show on NBC's Thursday night line up. Every single moment and every single character on this show is magical. I haven't been so excited about a new show since Glee came out. This show is definitely one of my all time favorite shows now. Im not afraid to say its perfect. There is not a single bad episode, and every one provides non stop witty humor. Also the last minute or two during the end credits with the characters Abed and Troy and hysterical!!!

There are outtakes, alternative scenes, producer's cuts, mini episodes, a highlight reel, two featurettes, and 25 commentaries with the cast/crew (that's one for each episode).  Clearly a lot of love has gone into this show AND the DVD content.  Of course, how can I look at other shows the same way again?  Most can't even match up to half of what this set offers.

Right now, Amazon is selling this for 17.99, and you can get 5 dollars off if you put in the code SONYFIVE.  Even if you were paying retail price for this, you'd be getting a MAJOR steal.

Admittedly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the show after the first couple episodes, but I stuck it out. It picked up a good deal of momentum very quickly; characters came together, playing nicely off one another, and all adding something to the show. Chevy Chase redeems himself from any and all crappy movies he's done in the last decade; now if Steve Martin could only do the same...Seriously though, an middle-eastern media nerd and black failed jock as best friends, a virginal cutie (and Mad Men star), a Bikini Kill wannabe, a Jesus Freak, and the irony of an Asian man as the Spanish teacher (Senor Chang). What a combo!!",1280793600,2,825,4.816901408450704
3957102,5,B002N5N5LG,"First, after just the pilot I had mixed feelings. I thought the show was at times very witty and funny, but often felt awkward and as if I did not know what direction it wanted to go in. It felt a bit unsure of itself and lost. And these feeling really lingered on, with a lot of changing elements till about the Christmas episode, where the show finally started to feel like it understood itself and really started to develop.

The humor of the show is great. It is important that the show has the ability to make fun of itself. Especially since it spends a lot of it's time making fun of other shows and movies. A lot of my favorite humor is around Abed's character. Either through his narration, or even his spoken words in the group, he often plays well off of the going ons of the group and relates them to movies, TV shows, and general stereotypical sitcom situations in general. And this is where the show does its best job at creating funny episodes. When they are really able to capture and play off of all of the generic storylines of TV shows, the show has a very good track record of creating excellent episodes.

The crucial part of this, is that even though a lot of the humor is making fun of the normal plots of TV shows, the show itself is still able to have those storylines and still not feel too trite. For example, the romantic interest of Jeff and Britta feels real and even though at times it is used as a vehicle for humor, it still has heart itself. Without these elements (like Abed and Troy's bromance also), the show would fall apart, and it is also a pretty tough balance to find, though it seems like Community did not seem to have all that much problem.

I will interject with a few negative feelings I had from this freshman season. First, I do not really like Pierce's character all that much. I think that while at times his characterization in the show, of being more or less the older guy still trying to fit in and be hip, just does not find its mark. He often is just not funny, in the sense that I understand a lot of his jokes are supposed to be funny because of their comparison with the rest of the group, but this style of humor gets old fast. And I also thought that the episode with Jack Black (Investigative Journalism) was bar far my least favorite episode. I thought the idea of the episode, that he was supposed to be the guest star that got in the episode and broke the normal ebb and flow of the show, was really a funny idea. But I thought they took it a step to far, and like a lot of Jack Black humor, was just flat and not funny.

But ending the cynicism, there were a few episodes I really liked. For example the Halloween episode, the Christmas Episode, the April Fools episode, and in particular, the Action movie episode (Modern Warfare). The last of which, being one of the best episodes of a comedy show I have seen in a long time. The movie cliches and references all worked well, and just created a fun episode. The Jeff/Britta stuff also worked well in this episode, especially with Abed's commentary and realization that something has changed by the end of the episode.;O:[CeK",1277078400,4,3141,4.345826235093697
3957103,5,B002N5N5LG,"So as I'm waiting for a release date for the first season of NBC's new show community, I thought I would write a review of the first season. I can not recommend this show enough. The first view episodes are a little rough as the cast was struggling with where they wanted the show to go and their chemistry, but by the end of the season I found myself not able to wait a week for the next episode. Many people have problems with Chevy Chase, but I thought he really brought the show together and was just flat out hilarious. While the main character Jeff (Joel McHale) is enough to keep you entertained, he is joined by an incredibly talented and hilarious cast. Middle-aged divorce Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Britta Perry(Gillian Jacobs) a mid-twenties woman returning to school who plays Jeff's main love interest are among other main characters. Along with them are Troy and Abed (who together deliver a very amusing bromance), a high school graduate who lost her scholarship after an addiction to adderall, and of course, the ever funny Pierce Hawthorne(Chevy Chase) a retired older man who is for some random reason back at community college. Ken Jeong joins the cast in the second episode as the students mentally insane spanish teacher, Senor Chang.
This show never gets old, especially with guest actors such as Jack Black , Owen Wilson, and Katharine McPhee. I can not recommend this show enough!",1276992000,5,1413,4.771428571428571

I was actually a little worried that it's intelligent comedic writing wouldn't catch on with enough people fast enough to keep the network form pulling the plug prematurely (ala Freaks And Geeks), so I'm surprised and excited that the show has become as popular as it has. I think throughout the season, it's on gotten funnier with everyone settling into their character and developing an amazing chemistry amongst the cast. I was a fan of Joel from The Soup, but he's really amazed me with his acting. I had never heard of the rest of the gang (except, of course, Chevy Chase, who is amazingly subtle as an affable twit of an old man) but find them all to be amazing actors and truly funny!",1276300800,2,730,4.537878787878788

3957106,5,B002N5N5LG,"As a Community College student myself not so long ago, I was interested what NBC Comedy could possibly do with such a wacky institution. The Results? I wish I went to this Community College...

First off, the show does take great liberties with the setting. My experience may have differed from the norm, but mostly what I saw was a bunch of apathetic people who couldn't wait till the moment they could get back home. They would never go to a candlelight vigil at night for example. The people of Greendale are the opposite of that. They care about EVERYTHING. They will create a candlelight vigil for wacky causes, and bake cookies for everybody there. Of course, the setting also gives a great sense of openness and freedom for the show. In this world, the possibilities are endless and anything can happen.

Next up, the stories. At the beginning, the show struggled hard to find itself, being more hit or miss more than anything, but after the first 5-10 episodes, the show really entered its own. A relationship doesn't work? Drop it! A pairing doesn't work? Separate them! Two actors had more chemistry then you originally realized? Put them together! A personality is too negative? Change it, then make jokes about it! Nothing holds this show down, and each time it comes down with more flair than the last time. May I also note that almost every episode takes advantage of each classroom setting really well? Plus, especially towards the end of the season, the episodes turn into complete brilliant parodies. An episode that takes on ""Goodfellas"" and other mafia movies? Do it! It's hilarious!

Plus, the cast is great for everything that is thrown at them. Joel McHale is excellent of course, Chevy Chase does a serviceable job, and everybody else, who were basically unknowns before the show, really break out here. This includes Donald Glover, Allison Brie, etc. Plus, Ken Jeong is great as always, and that's always a plus.

If you're still not convinced of the brilliance of Community, watch ""Modern Warfare."" Not overrated in the slightest, it's the best episode of TV period of the last 6 months, and the best episode of comedy in the past year. Everything that makes this show so great came together PERFECTLY for this episode to absolutely gut-wrenching comedy. Never before has ridiculousness, parody & inspired brilliance come together before like this since ""Airplane!""

Overall, in a year where The Office shows considerable signs of aging, new-comer Community upstages and BLOWS AWAY its older brethren. It's only a matter of when for the show to get a big cult following like The Office once did, so jump on now. It's just now starting to get really good, and you don't want to miss a minute of it.",1275955200,4,2722,4.820128479657388

The characters are all perfectly casted with wildly varying personalities, the episodes are a great mix of plots, just a great show.  I can't wait for season 2!",1274832000,4,469,4.4186046511627906

Its funny, makes a lot of references to different movies and shows from the 80's and 90's, and each character is very special. Chevy Chase and Danny Pundi steal the show most episodes! Favorite episodes include the Halloween special and Modern Warfare. This show is a definite buy!",1274227200,,507,4.404255319148936

But I gave it a chance, and I'm very glad I did.  The show is quite awesomely hilarious.  From the snarky and mean (but of course with a heart of gold) Joel McHale to the befuddled (and thankfully reigned in) Chevy Chase, to the downwright weird Danny Pudi as Abed, the Sheldon-like (Big Bang Theory) movie-obsessed and socially awkward savant, there's a great group of people that will make you laugh.  The rest of the study group (I'll switch to character names b/c I'm too lazy to look up the actors on imdb): Shirley, Britta, Annie, and Troy are also pretty funny.

The crown jewel is, of course, Seor Chang, the Asian spanish teacher.  He's hilarious.  And I love how everyone (including Chang) calls him ""senior"" Chang (rather than the correctly pronounced ""sen-yor"").

There are a ton of little touches here and there that add to the depth of the show.  Shot in the grittier non-sitcom style and with a surprisingly large number of ""background"" characters (Dean Pelton the gay chancellor who so wishes he was running a *real* college, Star Burns who has, well, sideburns the shape of a star, et al...).

My review turned into just character name-dropping, but there's so much funny stuff to write about each one of them (again, me: lazy).  I just can't get enough of the show, watch it!",1273449600,3,1438,4.650793650793651

If you don't, you still may love this show. Give it a shot!

I, along with many other people I know, were thrilled with this show from the beginning. Some others that I know needed a little bit of time to get acquainted with the characters before they really got into it. So I urge you, if you're a little skeptical after the pilot give it a chance for another episode or two.",1272412800,21,702,4.358778625954199

Recently I was depressed by the horrible comedies on TV and was kept in the dumps watching reruns of these great oldies. Two new shows have become the new Seinfeld/ELR/Frasier: Community and Modern Family. These two shows surprise me every week with how absolutely hilarious they are! This one is for slightly older people (teen and up) mainly because younger ones won't be able to keep up with the jokes. Modern Family is the choice for a show you can watch with, well, the whole [modern] family. This is an early review so if they end up releasing this set with all 20 episodes of season one you SHOULD DEFINITELY buy it from Amazon.com. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1270857600,2,762,4.6940298507462686

3957139,5,B002N5N5LG,"I feel a little like I'm cheating, writing a review 19/25 episodes through the season. However, I can strongly recommend Season 1 of Community to anyone who enjoys comedy. The show utilizes a talented cast - not just Joel McHale and Alison Brie, but everyone - for a fun mix of subtle and over-the-top humor. Although it took an episode or two to get up and running, once the writers had a chance to introduce the characters Community's been consistently funny ever since. I laughed more at ""Introduction to Statistics"" and the past several post-Olympics episodes than anything since The Norm Show.

Community doesn't merely get the easy jokes right, either; the writers and actors do an impressive job with some fairly subversive jokes about race, sex, etc. On top of all that, Community manages to be an upbeat show, which is a pleasant change of pace from stuff like It's Always Sunny... (which I also enjoy). I wouldn't go so far as to say it ""makes you think,"" but Season 1 has been a joy to laugh along with!",1268870400,47,1014,4.633333333333334

Chevy Chase is hysterical and it's great to see him back doing what he does best - making us laugh!

Overall this is my favorite show on television and one of the funniest sitcoms to come along in years!  I highly reccomend it to all and I can't wait to watch it on DVD!!!!

3957143,2,B002N5N5LG,"Just finished watching the first 3 episodes on Hulu.

I loved the premise, going to community college myself, I was really looking forward to this.  Especially with Chevy Chase being cast I came in with high expectations, but left with nothing but frustration.

Grading Community on a curve of the modern sitcom--The Office, 30 Rock, Arrested Development all receiving A's--I'd have to give it a D.  (To give more perspective, Parks & Recs would get a C)

Community falls into a trap of trying to explain its jokes.

Girl: ""You sneeze like girl""
Jock: ""Shut Up, before I pound you like a boy.  Uh, that didn't come out right.""

Uh, haha, I guess.  Outside of Abid, I can't remember a single characters name, which shows to weakness of the supporting cast.

After 3 episodes of The Office or 30 Rock--every bit character was memorable.  Here they feel like time fillers, cutaways.

If there's any redeeming clips to Community would be the end credits--whether its Abid and Jock rapping in Spanish or trying to Crunk.  Aside from that spare yourself this trainwreck.",1254441600,3,1064,4.8121546961325965
3957144,4,B002N5N5LG,"The pilot episode of ""Community"" holds a lot of promise for an intelligent and witty sitcom. No spoilers from me; the show centers on Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a fast talking lawyer who has been suspended by the State Bar for not having a real degree. This first episode introduces all of the major characters and through a clever plot device gives us some of their background biographies as well.

I was somewhat surprised to find Chevy Chase playing Pierce, an older student with a poor understanding of modern rules of behavior towards women. This could be an interesting character if allowed to develop.

Hopefully the rest of the season will be as good as this one.",1253491200,,671,4.726495726495727

I would watch another episode, although my college days are long over and normally do not reminisce about the times.  I was an older studious student type with an agenda and did minimal socializing.  I found the sororities too demanding for the amount of support and friendship they offer.  This is the other side of college life where the students learn more about themselves and life from each other than the courses offered at the institution can teach them.

""Annie Adderol"" is my favorite, but all of the characters are likable and possess a complexity that I can't wait to watch unravel. I found myself thinking that each of them is similar to specific people in my life.

It's refreshing to watch a show about real people, with real writing, as opposed to some of the crap that's on TV right now. I haven't wached NBC regularly since Friends ended, but I think I can make an exception for Community. It's about time!",1252800000,2,648,4.734513274336283

8374715,5,B002N5N5LG,"""Community"" is a beloved and acclaimed cult-comedy series that ran for six seasons between 2009 and 2015.  Created by Dan Harmon, the show follows an eclectic group of characters whom are brought together while attending Greendale Community College.  Though its production was oft-troubled and there were plenty of shake-ups both on-screen and behind-the-scenes over its six-year run, the fact remains- thanks to witty writing, stellar performances, incredibly likable characters and top-notch production values, ""Community"" is easily one of the best of the best.  An icon in the world of television comedy, and one of the greatest sitcoms of our time.

Season one gets things off to a strong start, with the majority of the episodes involving the introduction and establishment of the main characters and their dynamics with one-another.  There's Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a cynical disbarred lawyer who needs to earn a legitimate degree.  Britty Perry (Gillian Jacobs), a strong-willed but often misguided idealist and wannabe-activist.  Abed Nadir (Danny Pudy), a geeky student whose obsessed with films and whom seems to suffer from some sort-of developmental disorder.  Shirley Bennet (Yvette Nicole Brown), a motherly Christian housewife reeling from a recent divorce.  Annie Edison (Alison Brie), a High School graduate and compulsive over-achiever trying to shed her past as a pill-addict.  Troy Barnes (Donald Glover), a former High School football star whose trying to find his way in the world and escape the pressures of his past.  And Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase), an eccentric millionaire who has been enrolling in Greendale over and over to combat general boredom.  These seven unique individuals originally comes together as a study-group (albeit for less than noble reasons), but eventually blossom into a sort-of family throughout the season.

Part of the charm of Community is how it juggles both earnest and genuine character development and broad, conceptual satire to create a unique and whimsical experience.  While the series starts as a relatively standard, yet still exceptionally well-executed, sitcom, it quickly becomes something much more.  This is the sort-of show where one week, an episode might tackle a real and grounded issue with thoughtful handling of drama, and the next week... wed get a full-on parody loaded with satirical pop-culture references and cartoonish logic.  (And yes, I know that Community fans dread the word parody, but its the only word I can think of to describe some of these concept episodes.)

The cast is all magnificent (with special props going to Jacobs and Pudi, whom are by far my two favorite actors on the show) and really do their all with the wonderful material they are given.  Creator Dan Harmon and his crew of writers and directors also do a lot with the concept.  Theres paintball wars and mafia stories involving the school cafeteria that are absolutely hilarious  and at the same time also plenty of deliberate character-centric episodes that will tug at your heart-strings.  And the shows direction and editing is very well-done.  Not that youd expect anything else from a series whose directors include the Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Civil War) and Justin Lin.  (The Fast and the Furious franchise.)

As for the DVD release- this is a very good set for both fans and newcomers alike.  While Im still holding my breath for a potential Blu-Ray re-release at some point (this series is so cinematic, Id be worth re-buying in HD), whats here is pure gold.  Theres plenty of bonus content, including audio-commentary on every single episode, a plethora of outtakes, extended episodes and behind-the-scenes featurettes.  And the quality is quite good, with sharp picture and crisp sound.  Even though the entire series is available to view online on websites such as Hulu in the US and Netflix in Canada, Id definitely recommend this set to anyone interested.  For less than $20, you're getting well over 9 hours of content.  Thats a total steal!
