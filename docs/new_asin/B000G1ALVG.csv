8128438,2,B000G1ALVG,"Somewhere in this low budget shocker there might be a plot, but it's so muddled and incoherent, one may just wonder what in the world went on.  Needless to say, it's kind of a rip off of THE BODY SNATCHERS.  Some alien beings have invaded the earth and they take over human's bodies in an effort to populate and conquer the earth...I think.  Muscular Paul Sloan plays a convicted serial killer who is used to host the body of a ""friendly"" alien who is out to stop the hundred or so aliens invading us.  Colleen Porch plays Logan, his earthly partner whose role is minimalized and romanticized, too.  Writer/director Alex Villelonga plays Porch's enigmatic boss and mentor and Tony Denison shows up as the homicide detective investigating the murders.  The movie is poorly lit and directed, and lots of padding too.  Minimally entertaining.",1168646400,,839,4.825174825174825
