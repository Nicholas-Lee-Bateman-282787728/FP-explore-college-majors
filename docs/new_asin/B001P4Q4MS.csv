The camera loves the leading lady the D David Morin is thoroughly convincing as a control freak over the edge.  It has spots of humor to break the tension but not so much humor that the movie loses direction. The guys are hansome, the girls are sexy and forbidden sex adds to the fun.

Check it out!",1241049600,,369,4.242857142857143
3738124,5,B001P4Q4MS,"Great mystery movie, with lots of plot twists and turns. Keeps you guessing the whole time. Characters are all ones you love to hate, and just when you think you know whom to trust, it turns on you. A great evening's entertainment. Loved it!",1241049600,4,241,4.5
8332115,5,B001P4Q4MS,"I have to admit that I streamed this off of Youtube last night. I've seen about all that Amazon Prime has to offer presently so I decided to take a chance on 'Cold Play' at Youtube. I didn't know any of the actors but was surprised at how well the story was written and how many twists and turns came about to keep you guessing. It's a pretty good murder mystery with a beginning that has you believe something to have happened with two suspects. As the story unfolds more characters come into play and the mystery thickens. If you like a good who done it with lots of twist, you might want to give this one a try at least once.",1468368000,,628,4.155737704918033
8332116,4,B001P4Q4MS,"This is a pretty good suspense thriller. While the acting is a little bland, this movie is full of satisfying twists and turns. It does however have a made for tv movie feel to it......But that's nothing as I still enjoyed it.",1440892800,2,226,4.404761904761905
8332117,5,B001P4Q4MS,I loved it! It is always deserving of a rerun and especially with friends. I suggest you get. The beginning is unusual - the middle is intriguing - the end will blow your mind.,1369612800,,176,4.205882352941177
8332118,4,B001P4Q4MS,"I don't understand why movies (like this one) reveal a scene from later on in the movie in the beginning.  It didn't hurt this movie and I guess it was part of the ""twist,"" but I still find it unappealing.  Otherwise, this is a good movie.  The characters are good, and the story/plot is well done.  I was able to guess the ending to an extent, but I still enjoyed how the movie turned out.  This movie is definitely worth checking out if you enjoy a good suspense/mystery/thriller type film.",1348444800,,492,4.4222222222222225
8332119,3,B001P4Q4MS,"It is hard to describe anything about this movie without ruining it. I can only say that the ""private eye"" in this flick should have seen everything coming well before.....well, before it occurred.
Good acting, good plot. A bit obvious one would think but well worth the rental. I would NOT buy a physical copy to re-watch, once was enough, but it was a decent movie especially considering my recent lack of being able to pick a decent movie to rent from Amazon on demand..",1334448000,,473,4.576470588235294
8332120,2,B001P4Q4MS,"A cast of unknowns make this potentially interesting. However, they almost all overact, especially the rich jealous husband whose antics are actually comedic rather than threatening. The Scottish investigator also oversteps at times, and the beautiful wife is mostly clicheed. The plot twists are ok, but not all that surprising. This has the whiff of a TV movie at times.",1278806400,2,372,5.216666666666667
8332121,5,B001P4Q4MS,"This one has more turns than a Cork Screw, and the players are deeper that he Celtics relief bench.

Its like who's zooming who, the beautiful woman's controlling husband is a real piece of work, the snoop, private investigator; is also a real character.

The woman herself proves to be quite capable of handling her destiny; while being used and manipulated by a bunch of wolves.",1275609600,,380,4.742424242424242
8332122,4,B001P4Q4MS,Very stylish.  Great production values.  Keeps your interest from the first frame to the last.  Great chemistry between the characters.  Worth a second viewing.  Why wasn't this in theaters?,1241395200,4,190,5.413793103448276
8332123,5,B001P4Q4MS,"This is a great movie that will keep you guessing until the very end!  Just when you think you've figured it out you get pleasantly surprised by the ending.  I highly recommend it, especially if you want to discover a cool flick that most people don't know about yet.",1241136000,2,267,4.428571428571429
8332124,5,B001P4Q4MS,"If you like twists and turns and an ending that makes you say, ""OMG I didn't see that coming coming!"" Then you'll enjoy Cold Play. Vanessa Branch is smokin hot! Great entertainment. A great little indy film.",1241049600,,207,4.621621621621622
