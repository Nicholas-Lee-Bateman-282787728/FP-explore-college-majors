2566659,1,B000FI9OEA,"This British comedy could have been very enjoyable, but all the f-words and sexual content completely spoiled the series.  This series is from the BBC, so I was quite shocked.  I wish there would have been a rating on Amazon for bad language and sexual content.",1180396800,12,261,4.6521739130434785
2566660,4,B000FI9OEA,"With its darkish humor, fine ensemble acting and atypical writing, this series deserves the chance to develop beyond a single season. For now, it's still a bit predictable and at times strains for a laugh, but it does manage to remain darkly funny over the course of each installment. The cast does a good job of portraying several familial archetypes -- especially Martin Freeman of ""Tim"" and ""Arthur Dent"" fame, again playing a worthy and charming loser who routinely finds himself on the wrong end of almost every situation.

To break out of the typical sitcom formula we also witness the myriad setbacks experienced by his more successful siblings. Setbacks they seem unable to recognize thanks to their ability to protect their egos with their professional accomplishments -- something Freeman's character has been stripped of. So what adds a little more shading here is the different ways in which these people respond to their own problems and the way they subsequently skew the view of their family members' problems. In short, no matter how strange their individual failings may be, anyone and everyone else is assumed to be even worse off.

There's a further twist as well -- albeit a somewhat gimmicky one. This pattern of failures and missed opportunities are given an inherited dimension by visiting a stream of odd and eccentric family failures down through the generations.  At times these asides work well and play off the current storyline, and at other times they seem just stuck on to give the writers and audience alike a breather. When it works, it's funny. When it doesn't it offers a little twinge similar to the pain that some of those should-have-been-abandoned  Python sketches pioneered.

While ""The Robinsons"" is yet some distance from reaching the polished and perfect pitch of ""The Office"", the present is above average television comedy, and the future potential remains high. Let's hope this loser wins in the end.",1148947200,27,1946,5.031055900621118
2566661,5,B000FI9OEA,"What an absolutely hilarious series.  Such a shame we  only have one series.  It had us doubled over in agony from laughter.  The Robinsons, where does one start?  Suffice it to say the lead character has two feuding parents, a sister who is an over the top highly tense, intense perfectionist, a highly successful brother who is achievement/success driven and the poor main character himself who may be the only ""normal"" one of the lot is viewed by the rest of his uptight clan as being the ""problem"".  Way too good a series to miss.  To be viewed repeatedly with same laughable results!",1455408000,,588,4.650485436893204

2566663,4,B000FI9OEA,"I knew this was an show from awhile ago, and wanted to see Martin Freeman, Hugh Bonneville, and others when they were younger.  Quality is what you would expect from an older show, but it is one of the better ones.  I have never seen it.",1442188800,,237,4.130434782608695

2566667,5,B000FI9OEA,"This series was hilarious beginning to end.  I cannot believe no one saw it when it aired, deserved WAY more episodes.  Martin Freeman is so loveable in this, along with Hugh Bonneville and Richard Johnson (RIP)  such a great cast, and funny all the way through :)",1437004800,,264,4.574468085106383

2566672,5,B000FI9OEA,"Brilliant, hilarious, well written and beautifully played by all the actors and above all by Martin Freeman absolutely excellent ! But only 6 episodes, it ends really too abruptly, very frustrating, we want more !",1403308800,,213,5.114285714285714
2566673,5,B000FI9OEA,I saw it in England several years ago and searched for the show on DVD.  Very happy to have it!  I do not intend to lend it to anyone for fear of not getting it back...and also it is not available anywhere else online.  Love this series!,1391472000,2,237,4.0
2566674,5,B000FI9OEA,Extremely funny and certainly very underrated. I missed out on this series when it first screened but was lucky to catch the first episode on BBC I-Player. Fast-moving comedy with many jokes you first register the second time around. Excellent entertainment!,1385510400,5,258,5.317073170731708
2566675,5,B000FI9OEA,"You'll want to watch this over and over.  Can't understand why only one series in the lot (even 'Hardware' had two seasons).  And, of course, any time Martin Freeman and Olivia Colman get together, you know you will have some priceless moments.",1385251200,3,244,4.785714285714286
2566676,5,B000FI9OEA,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  I am a BIG fan of British comedy and this is one of my all time favorites.  I play the episodes over and over again.  Wish it had lasted more than 1 season.  I loved the over-the-top absurd quirkiness of all the characters.  I especially loved Vicky.  When she mistook her father for her elderly boyfriend....well that was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a TV series.  I was laughing so hard, I almost threw-up.",1381622400,7,469,4.261363636363637
2566677,5,B000FI9OEA,I expected this show to be quite funny but I ended up watching the whole season in one sitting. It was hilarious! A lot funnier than I expected. Too bad this is the only season of this show.,1379116800,4,190,4.026315789473684
2566678,2,B000FI9OEA,"See Martin Freeman and Hugh Bonneville before they became REALLY big - but otherwise, insipid dialogue, missing beats.

The writers tried, and in some moments, they get it, the joke, the timing.  Most of the time however the characters are not odd and strange enough, the timing is off, or they are too contrived.

The writers really try to do something different here, but somehow, it doesn't work consistently.  They got 90% but did not finish the 10%

Give them another chance - everyone has a dud or a few in their careers.

I stopped watching at the end of Series One. I just don't want to know anymore about the characters.",1362873600,2,629,4.571428571428571
2566679,3,B000FI9OEA,"This was very enjoyable, but could have done without the vulgar language.
I would recommend, As Time Goes By, before ever recommending this one.",1231286400,9,144,5.041666666666667
2566680,5,B000FI9OEA,"Yes, definitely not for the prudish but if you enjoy Shameless, Black Books or other quirky, dark and sometimes raunchy series - this is for you!  Would have loved to see a season two....",1207699200,10,187,4.5

8122819,1,B000FI9OEA,I was a little disappointed with the amount of language used. I stopped watching it 10 minutes in and threw it away,1499817600,,115,4.2727272727272725

8122821,1,B000FI9OEA,Let's just say it should be rated 'R'.  I am too old for a plot that is based on bad words and sex scenes. Just not my cup of tea!,1477612800,,130,3.3333333333333335
8122822,5,B000FI9OEA,"I can't really add much to the excellent positive reviews of this sitcom except to say that its' failure proves that comedy is a very personal thing.

I really, really loved this show.",1474502400,,184,4.575757575757576
