8573864,5,B00BU8USGC,"Hilarious, original and witty. This show is a breath of fresh air from all the normal junk on tv today. Had to buy this all the way from the UK. I really wish they sold this in America with region 1 dvd's.",1424563200,2,205,3.9047619047619047
8573865,5,B00BU8USGC,"This show is the best. It is truly hilarious and the actors are great in it. Out of the three main characters I can't decide which is my favorite they play their rolls great and are hilarious in completely different ways. Grumio is the slave who attempts to cook and clean but is horrible at it so he results to cheating at his duties. Like rummaging through trash for food. Then serving it as if he made it. Stylax is the nave one who always thinks his idiotic ideas will pan out and they usually do for him no matter how outrageous. Marcus is the brains but nothing works out for him. They are office supplies at an office Marcus the copier, Stylax the shredder, and Grumio doesn't work aside from being a slave that is more trouble than good. The supporting actors are also hilarious. The landlord is awesome. If you have a supportive DVD player or if Amazon offers a digital version I recommend everyone watch it.",1415232000,3,917,4.431952662721893
8573866,5,B00BU8USGC,"Total hilarity discovered in London, thanks to jet lag and ITV.

A bit like Seinfield if it were set in ancient Rome... we follow roommates pragmatic sad-sack Marcus, and the eternally upbeat, libidinous Stylax, 20-somethings just arrived in the Big City, working entry level jobs in a scriptorium. Imagine your office if the copier and shredder could verbally abuse the water cooler...  Follow them as they meet the neighbors, plan to attend an orgy, cheer at the coliseum, encounter a new fruit, get the clap, try to get laid, etc, etc.

It's just really funny. Having watched the six episodes over and over, we anxiously await the incipient release of season 2. If you have a multi-region DVD player this is entertainment money well spent. Why wait possibly years for a US channel to air it? If you like Brit Com this is for you.",1390780800,5,832,4.724137931034483
8573867,5,B00BU8USGC,"While traveling in London earlier this year, I happened to see this show. It doesn't try to make more of itself than it is, which is a great part of its charm. I saw only the first 3 episodes, but they were hilarious. I am glad to see it is now on blue ray, so I can see the rest of the first season.",1379721600,,300,3.703125
