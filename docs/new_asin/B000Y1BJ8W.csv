8230688,5,B000Y1BJ8W,"I have been playing clawhammer about 1 year. This video takes you through hand placement, tuning, clawhammer stroke and timing. She starts you out with chords in G and helps you to find the melody of the song within the chords.  It is not an easy DVD by any means and you must practice. She takes you into other tunings, C and double C. She teaches you several songs slowly and then plays them along with guitar.  She shows you how to add hammer ons.....I felt it was a great DVD and not one you could breeze through. You really have to practice these songs...
I highly recommend this DVD. There are several ideas she covers in this DVD I wish I would have known early on.  After I finish this DVD I will definately order Volume 2.",1282435200,4,731,4.282608695652174
