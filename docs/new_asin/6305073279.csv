960686,5,6305073279,The video and audio tweaks allowed by use of this DVD and some good sense can impart an incredible amount of improvement to any set up.  It did for mine.  A nice addition to have is an audio level meter like that found at  Radio Shack.,911779200,,235,4.065217391304348
960811,4,6305073279,"This DVD is an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to extract the most from their home theater. I am the managing head installer for a high-end Audio/Video salon in NY. Don't let the price concious reveiwers fool you, this DVD may be a little [much] but it provides you with reference video setup patterns whose use yeilds excellent results. Yes, your picture will look much much better. The audio tracks are usefull only to assure of proper hook-up, but the video tracks will give you a mastered set of calibration patterns for your monitor including black and white levels, color, hue sharpness and geometry. As professional set-up usually costs $300 and up, fifty bucks isn't that bad ... This DVD will improve your display, GAURANTEED! (For professionals some additional test patterns could be included; and as I am aware, an updated dvd is due to be released with all the features of the original Laserdisc including the full frame indian head pattern.) If you know what your getting you know this is an excellent tool indeed.",975110400,40,1032,4.836158192090395
960812,2,6305073279,"For me, this purchase was a total waste of money... I have surround sound and a regular 27 inch Sony tv.  I had set everything up well before even buying the disc, when I went through everything...nothing had to be changed. Now, if you have a serious, complex, advanced A/V system or don't understand how to set up your system, then this title is for you (even then I would still say, ""rent it"").  If you just have a TV and surround sound (a ""normal"" home theater..no offence to you A/Vphiles) then I don't think you need this....again, rent it, if you find it is helpful, then buy. For the price, I think it is not worth it.  This DVD takes advantage of the fact that some folks still won't take the time to figure out how to program their VCRs.  Final Verdict... Rent It!",970790400,10,773,4.310344827586207
960813,2,6305073279,"This DVD has good explanations of what it is doing, the use of the filter to set the color balance correctly was useful.  Running this did actually  marginally improve the picture.
However, if you are a videophile with a  projection TV there is one enormous omission:  There is no pattern  available to make sure the three colors properly converge on your screen.  Incorrect convergence has a huge impact on picture clarity.
This DVD is  desperately in need of an update, it needs to take projection HDTVs into  account.  More attention to detail is required to get the best from the  latest and greatest TVs and it just wasn't available here.
As it stands  this DVD is worth no more than $15.  With a few more up-to date features  (such as convergence) It'd be worth up to $25.  As it stands I'm very  dissapointed.",966211200,12,816,4.608391608391608
960814,5,6305073279,An absolutely fundamental title for any DVD library.  It gives you easy to follow tutorials that enable you to adjust your TV properly as well as your  surround sound audio system.  If you purchase no other title this will  enhance every other material you will ever view on your TV.,966124800,,283,4.6
960815,4,6305073279,THIS TOOL DVD IS EASIER TO USE THAN AVIA THOUGH IT IS NOT AS FULL OF INFORMATION AS THE AVIA DVD. I OWN BOTH AND WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING A BETTER PICTURE FROM BOTH OF THESE I CHOOSE VIDEO ESSENTIALS FOR MY OWN  TELEVISIONS BUT KEEP IN MIND YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT BRAND YOU MIGHT  EVEN HAVE A DIFFERENT METHOD OF VIEWING (I USE DIRECTVIEW [TRADITIONAL])BUT  AS FAR AS THE SOUND CALIBRATIONS YOU GET DECENT HELP FROM V.E BUT REALLY  GOOD HELP FROM AVIA BUT BOTH NEED A SPL METER(THAT'S A SOUND METER)THAT  COST FROM $30 ON UP. MY OVERALL OPINION IS THAT IT IS A GOOD DVD TO OWN.BYE,964656000,9,584,4.178571428571429
960816,5,6305073279,"I felt that I needed to write a review because so many of the other reviewers clearly didn't understand much of the purpose of this DVD.
Problem: you need to setup a projector or projection tv (e.g. set  the dynamic convergence). You read the service manual. It says ""feed a  checkerboard test signal into the projector and proceed to tweak the  following variable resistors inside the set until red converges with  green..."" Hmm, you don't have a video test pattern generator do you ?  But...stick this DVD in your DVD player and lo and behold you now DO have a  pretty good test pattern generator. And at $40 it's a heck of a lot  cheaper than the real thing.
Obviously not everyone needs to or is able  to perform dynamic convergence or focus adjustments  on their equipment,  but I do and so do many others and this disk is a godsend for us.",956188800,25,845,4.4640522875816995

960818,3,6305073279,"Some love it and some hate it. I'm somewhat inbetween. The first part ""Audio Setup"" does nothing more than help you to connect the wires correctly and adjust the channel levels. I think everyone with a  basic understanding is able to do this without this DVD. I expected some  more help in finding the correct location for speakers and listener in the  room (distance from wall, distance from listener, etc.). But besides a note  to try different spots for placing the sub-woofer(s), not one word is spent  about this topic. From my point of view, this part is absolutely worthless  and could be reduced to a few words on a piece of paper. The ""Video  Section"" is somewhat different. It offers some good reference pictures  and explanations to correctly set brightness, contrast, sharpness, tint and  color. After going trough all steps, the picture of my TV set really did  look a lot better ! But here also I expected some more in depth  insight.
Summa summarum: It's a really good tool to improove the image  quality of your set. But the price is way to high ! $10.- would be a fair  price.",953596800,79,1093,4.601036269430052
960819,5,6305073279,"Ignore the people who poo-pooed this title.  If you've ever chased your brightness, contrast or hue adjustments all over the place, this DVD will put an end to it.  It will show you how to adjust your TV so that it is  CORRECT.  Period.  If you care about that, then you have to get Video  Essentials (or rent it if you must).",953424000,7,326,4.17741935483871
960820,1,6305073279,"I bought this DVD after reading several 5 star comments. After spending over 2 hours to adjust the system, there was absolutely no improvement had been noticed in both the picture and sound quality. Please spend your money  on something else.",951436800,3,242,4.902439024390244
960851,2,6305073279,"I just bought a new Toshiba widescreen and Yamaha Dolby Digital receiver.  I found this DVD informative but I only had to do very minor tweaking to my system so I couldn't justify the high price.

960852,5,6305073279,"Joe Kane's Video Essentials is widely viewed as the definitive reference disc for home theater calibration.  It explains many of the necessary technical details of your home theater system, then provides tests to allow you to optimize both the audio and video sections, and explains to you why  you are making these adjustments.  Overall its very helpful, particularly  if you take your home theater system seriously.
A drawback is the  relatively high price.  If you are an enthusiast you should consider  purchasing this disc and a  SPL meter.  If you  enjoy home theater more casually, then simply renting this DVD would be a  more cost effective way to go.",948326400,12,660,4.963302752293578

It does it's job well, but the secret behind it is rather silly and cheap.  Not to crazy about payiing  all that money either.

7882234,5,6305073279,This is one of the product I would recommend to anyone who appreciates their home systems but wanted more from their systems. This disc is very helpful for calibrating visual and audio and surround sound.,1369267200,,204,4.857142857142857
7882235,1,6305073279,I have never received this item.  I have written to the supplier but have never received a reply.  I cannot say whether it is good or bad.,1227398400,,138,4.074074074074074
7882236,2,6305073279,"First of all, like most DVD's you are not able to simply navigate this DVD with the Title and Chapter Menu buttons. No, the author decided in his infinite wisdom to make navigation a chore by accessing a ""Program Menu"" which only after significant effort I was able to finally figure out how to get to point A to point B and even then it required cumbersome navigation and took far too long. It was really an aggravation and frustrating since my principle concern was not learning how to navigate the damn DVD but learning how to calibrate my system.
After wasting far far too much time figuring out how to navigate through the DVD I then undertook to calibrate my system. The author's introductory chapters are interesting and informative, BUT he fails to follow up on the initial promise of the DVD by leaving you without adequate instructions on how to use the test tones and video tools.
For instance, he has half right speaker tones, but never explains what in the heck they are for. After a brief and disappointing intro to both audio and video he simply throws the test tones at you. Why didn't he have a thorough step by step explanation of exactly how to use them.
The other problem is that he uses terms he does not completely explain or define leaving this user confused and scratching his head.
If you are an expert and know what you are doing then this DVD might be more useful than it was to me.
Hopefully, I'll eventually figure out how to use the darn thing.
Summary impression:  EXTREMELY cumbersome navigation!  Poor incomplete explanations of vital information.  My next step:  Try Avia with hopefully better luck!",1067644800,2,1633,4.640138408304498
7882237,5,6305073279,"I have had this DVD for years.  It was tought to buy it at first since $25 seemed like a lot for something I would only use once.  And I figured I would just use it to tune my audio, who worries about their TV anyways?  Well, I used it for both and it made a big difference.  Since then I have used it on other TVs and all of them have been improved.
But something recently just amazed me.  The text menus on my DVD player started looking funny and were hard to read.  I really thought something was wrong with my DVD player or maybe the component video cables.  Well, finally I put this disc back in and re-tuned my TV and it looks perfect, once again.  I guess my settings were messed up at some point...",1066867200,2,706,4.028776978417266

7882239,4,6305073279,"I have the Laser Disk version (now out of print) and this DVD version is just as good. However, it takes a lot of navigation to go directly to the test images as they are not listed in the main menu. There is a new version coming from Joe Kane later this year replete with progressive scan programming, and I'm told this menu short-coming will be fixed.

7882240,4,6305073279,"This was a very good start out for set up on our projector systems. Everything was straight forward in it's text, and very helpful. Only one problem keeping us from giving this DVD a 5 star was trying to get to different chapters was very difficult. Otherwise this was very useful. Great audio section in the first few chapters for set up of sound around. Hope they come out with a new version including DTS. Thanks again, great job.

7882241,3,6305073279,"Having purchased both discs, I have very strong feelings about this. Avia bests VE in almost every respect:
1. Navigation: On VE, the navigation is handled by a very confusing set of menus within menus. On my DVD remote, I could only access one of the menus using a button that I otherwise never use. Until I figured this out, the only way I could skip through the initial (not very useful) audio stuff was to fast forward! Avia's menus work like every other menu I have ever used. No problem with navigation.
2. Color calibration: VE offers only a blue filter. However, Avia provides red, blue, and green filters and allows you set each independently.
3. Sharpness: VE simply tells you to turn your sharpness all the way down. The pattern for setting sharpness is so under explained, it is useless. Avia provides a full explanation and resulted in my setting the sharpness level considerably above zero.
4. Brightness and Contrast settings: VE provides only static bars (and requires that your DVD passes pure black). Avia provides bars that flash. This makes getting proper settings much easier. Also, your DVD doesn't have to pass pure black.",989539200,131,1145,4.817258883248731
7882242,3,6305073279,"The video calibration section is this DVD's strength.  The explanations of the roles of brightness, contrast, sharpness, color, and tint, together with steps of how to adjust them to get the most proper picture, are great.  Also a blue filter is included for use with the color test patterns (but no green or red ones).  Still, the program scarcely mentions certain video issues such as grey scales, picture convergence and trigonometry, and only says they need to be handled by professional technicians.  Also, there are many clips of what look like real TV programs scattering throughout the disc that are supposedly for you to test your display, but we are never really told what to do with them other than just ""eye-balling"" them and see if they look right after you made your video adjustments.
The audio calibration section not only doesn't tell me anything new, it doesn't tell me nearly close to what I (or most people) already know.  It merely comprises of a brief ""tour"" of surround system, a superficial segment that essentially just reminds you to check your connections, a segment on checking polarity of the center speaker, and separate segments containing pink noises for testing each speaker, which is something most people already have built into their receivers.  There is absolutely not a word on important issues like acoustics of the room, speaker placements, cabling, or what type of speakers to use.
I sincerely hope the disc maker would release an improved edition of the disc that has expanded coverage on audio.  But I would hate to pay a higher price for it since it is already at a premium.",979430400,17,1618,4.883211678832117
