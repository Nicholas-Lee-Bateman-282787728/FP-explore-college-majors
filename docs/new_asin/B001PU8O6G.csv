3761186,5,B001PU8O6G,"It's obvious to me from reading the other reviews that the manufacturer has since changed the packaging completely.  I bought my copy at Borders and, since I had read these reviews beforehand, specifically told them that once I bought it I wanted to open it on the spot and examine the DVDs for scratches.

The DVDs were packaged no differently than a number of other boxed sets (such as the Elizabeth Gaskell Collection, for those who happen to own it); a clear, hard plastic 'book' with each DVD on it's own 'page', with the little press-in-the-middle release button.  No cardboard touching them whatsoever on either side.  Nevertheless, I took every DVD off to examine closely.  One had a clearly visible fingerprint, which was easily wiped off.  Two others had very small smudges which mostly came off.  I've been watching one of those (Bleak House) to see if the smudge causes problems.  So far, I'm on the fifth episode and there have been no skips whatsoever (hope I didn't just jinx it, but anyway...)

The quality of the BBC productions of Bleak House and Little Dorrit are outstanding.  I can't speak for the others yet, but the BBC has a great reputation.  I haven't read the books, so I can't speak to how true they are to Dickens' writings, which others have commented on.

Regardless, I'm glad I added this to my collection!",1280275200,12,1338,4.719827586206897
3761187,1,B001PU8O6G,I thought I had purchased a defective set but after reading some of the reviews here I am convinced this is a poorly designed product. I cannot even describe the frustration we felt when we sat down to watch Little Dorrit and Bleak House. Every single DVD skipped and froze. It was impossible to watch. I wish I had not spent over $100 for this. My advice is not to purchase this product.,1262217600,35,388,4.328767123287672
3761188,5,B001PU8O6G,"Great stories by Charles Dickens.  Really liked Little Dorrit. If you like English period movies, you'll like these.",1245974400,4,116,5.444444444444445
3761189,1,B001PU8O6G,"What I was able to watch of the DVDs was really great, but all of the disks started skipping part way through and I was unable to watch the complete story.  I even had Amazon replace the first set I received hoping that it was a problem with that particular set, but that was not the case.  The second set I got had the same problem.

It's either in the production or the packaging, which may have caused damage to the DVD that is causing the skipping problems.",1243814400,70,461,4.215909090909091
3761190,1,B001PU8O6G,"These are great stories, however the ""Masterworks Collection"" is a rip-off. All of the disks start skipping around the second episode. Too bad really. I had to pay more to buy Bleak House and Little Dorrit seperately.",1243641600,60,217,4.891891891891892
3761191,1,B001PU8O6G,"I should have read the reviews and followed my instincts before buying this set.  It as, as repeatedly noted, entirely defective.  Don't make the mistake we've all made.  Shame on Amazon and shame on me.",1417910400,,203,4.742857142857143

3761194,2,B001PU8O6G,"I would have loved this if I could have watched it through.  I think the packaging form scratched the disc when I removed it.  I had three dics that I could not watch through.  Very disappointed because I bought this new.  I've asked my local video store to please clean it and polish(?) it for me and they said they would, so I am hopeful.  Don't wish to return it if I can salvage it.  Again, I believe it is the sleeve it came in, very difficult to get out.",1411689600,3,460,4.055555555555555
3761195,1,B001PU8O6G,Sorry excuse for movies. They play halfway and stops. And I am surprised that after all the bad reviews Amazon still let it sell.,1410393600,,129,4.416666666666667

3761198,1,B001PU8O6G,"These are great performances (to the extent that we could watch them).  Great Expectations, Bleak House, Little Dorrit and the Old Curiosity Shop all either stopped/froze or went into a stutter mode at about an hour.  Moving from my TV-DVD player to computer; the computer wouldn't even recognize most of the disks.  No obvious defect on the disks, have played hundreds of DVDs without this sort of problem.  Thank you Amazon for at least making it easy to return.  Now you need to stop carrying this product or get them to update.  July 2014.",1405382400,2,543,4.723404255319149
3761199,5,B001PU8O6G,"I was determined to find Little Dorrit on dvd for the best price possible, and this was definitely it.  After reading the other reviews, I purchased a new copy from a seller who stated that they accept returns (Primetime Deals).  The set I received looked like a book (as pictured) and had cardboard pages with the discs in pockets.  I played through the first disc, expecting it to freeze just before a critical plot twist, but it played to the end.  As did the next one, and the next one.  All of them played without problem.

I am very appreciative of the many reviews pointing out the problems encountered, because I have experienced that before.  It is terribly frustrating and inconvenient.  This time I was warned and prepared.  Not sure why this copy played ok and other copies didn't, but wanted to report the experience for consideration.",1404345600,10,848,4.714285714285714
3761200,5,B001PU8O6G,"There is no one who could write like Dickens today.  His development of hundreds of characters is phenomenal.  His descriptions are rich and his ability to transport one into a scene or period is so masterful.  This collection of films is very good for the most part.  There have been previous productions that I liked better such as The Little Dorrit production with Derek Jacobi but cannot find it on disc for U.S. play.  Once I got  used to the actor playing the ""new"" Mr. Clenam, Matthew Macfayden, this proved to be an enjoyable production with some wonderful character portrayals.  I especially was fond of the gypsy, Mr. Pancks. The fearsome Rigaud was masterfully portrayed.  James Fleet who is a very active actor and a favorite of mine was the perfect brother to Amy's father Mr. Dorrit.  Emma Pierson as Fanny Dorrit was  brilliant and a scene stealer and was all around terrific.  Ms. Pierson made this production for me.  She was fun and multi-faceted.  Alun Armstrong as Flintwich certainly made an outstanding performance in portraying this character.  All in all,  there is a great cast in this production.
Great Expectations was pretty good but previous productions are much better.  The Old Curiosity Shop could not be saved even with Derek Jacobi present.  It was an awlful production and this story has never been a favorite of mine.  There were so many missed opportunities to make this a good production.
The productions I found especially enjoyable were Bleak House and Little Dorrit.
Bleak House was a very rich and thought out production.  I even liked Gillian Anderson's portrayal of Lady Dedlock.  All of the actors were top-notch.  Mr. Guppy, portrayed by Burn Gorman was one of my favorites.  Philip Davis' portrayal of the disgusting Smallweed was iconic.  Charles Dance pulled off a brilliant Tulkinghorn.  Alun Armstrong, who has been in many films and TV productions was present in Bleak House and Lilttle Dorrit.  Mr. Armstrong is an actor's actor.  He immerses himself in every role and to say he is genius is not enough praise.  The talented Anna Maxwell Martin was charming as Esther Summerson and, I believe, perfect for the part.  This production also had a wonderful cast.
Now, with all the praise mentioned here, there have been problems with the discs themselves.  I was able to find a seller who tested the entire collection and I have found it nearly glich free.  There were only a couple of small trouble spots freezing in the entire collection.  So, if you decide to buy this collection,  find a seller who has tested the discs and found them free of defects.",1401062400,2,2605,4.85
3761201,1,B001PU8O6G,Amazon is still selling defective disc set!  Programs hang up and freeze as described previously by other reviewers.  Returned set for refund as did others.  Apparently this problem has been happening for at least 2 years.  Heed previous reviewers before ordering.  Will be leaving bad transaction feedback as well.,1400889600,2,315,5.346938775510204
3761202,1,B001PU8O6G,"I took a chance, because the price was so low... but alas, every single disk was defective. Actually, they got so stuck that it became kind of hard to operate my player! So unless you have a high tolerance for incomplete dramas and technical frustration, you should not buy these.",1400630400,2,280,4.62
3761203,2,B001PU8O6G,"The films are lovely, however it had to be sent back. The disks were defective. They would play fine for a few minutes, or even an entire episode, then the next one would skip or freeze. Return was easy.",1398556800,3,203,4.230769230769231
3761204,1,B001PU8O6G,"I purchased this collection without reading the reviews and I promise you, that will not be a mistake I make twice. I love the bleak house and wanted it for my collection. I have never seen any of the others before but thought this was a great buy for the entire set. I understand completely why it is such a great buy. Thank you amazon. I attempted to watch Little Dorrit and it was getting really interesting when the dvds started to skip. I tried playing them in my computer and my player for the tv and it didn't matter, they still skipped and stopped and wouldn't go any further. I thought cleaning them would help out seeing as they were covered in fingerprints and scratches but it was a waste of time. It is a shame though because I really was wanting to finish Little Dorrit.

Tried them on a computer and on two DVD players and they stopped at exactly the same point.  Not 1 disc, but all 10 of them.

3761209,1,B001PU8O6G,"It would probably be a good idea to read up on Amazon's return process if you order this item.  You will be returning the item once you try watching the movies.  If you are ordering this item simply to impress your friends with your literary knowledge of classics, then it is a good buy.  If you plan on actually viewing the movies, you will soon learn the meaning of ""Made in China"". Each disk will play fine to a point; however, none will play to the end of the disk.  Generally, the disk will stop playing at an important point in the film.  The films are great, but don't plan on watching them through this set.  Also, Charles Dickens won't appreciate it if you try creating your own endings to these classics once the disks stop playing.",1375747200,8,742,4.37956204379562

That's what inspired me to purchase the set. Well, this is the most ragged, poorly constructed set of DVD's that I've ever purchased! Mid-way through Twist it just froze. And that was it! The DVD never moved again. I tried several of the others and they skipped at various important places. Just let me say that the experience was TERRIBLE! and now I am leary about replacing them! BBC -- do better!",1375315200,4,569,4.643564356435643
3761211,1,B001PU8O6G,had to return these.  The dvds would not run in places on the discs do to the way they packaged the set.  To bad too.  It would have been nice to have the whole set together.,1367884800,8,174,3.7777777777777777
3761212,1,B001PU8O6G,"I made the mistake in buying this thinking they had solved all the technical issues everyone else wrote about.  They have not.  This is a piece of garbage in terms of quality.  The DVD's do not play and if they do, be prepared for them to freeze and then having to skip a lot of the story.  Amazon should have pulled this product a long time ago and demanded it be fixed.  As of May 1, 2013, this is still a problem, obviously, and do not make the same mistake I did.",1367366400,23,467,4.032608695652174
3761213,1,B001PU8O6G,"This seemed like a wonderful deal, with many of my favorite Dickens novels on film, and several of my favorite BBC productions.  However, from the moment I removed the discs from the packaging sleeves, they wouldn't play.  There was a strange discoloration on each of the discs and random scratches on 8 of them--from the moment I removed them from the case, without my having done a thing with them.  Most of the discs would only play for a short while then freeze.  I returned this item to Amazon before realizing they only refund 50% on open DVDs whether it's the customer's fault or not, so now I'm out half my money for movies I never even got to watch.  DO NOT BUY this product if you want to be able to enjoy the excellent films in the collection.",1363564800,4,754,4.39568345323741

I would purchase this again IF I knew they would play without losing so much content; but, from what I've read here, this is inherent in this set, and I wondered if the packaging itself wasn't harmful as they slide into those cardboard pockets and maybe somehow in packaging them, they were all damaged.

However trying both films and finding them sticking at the samepoint, we gave up. We live in SE Asia, so I can't be bothered sending them back.  I'll stick to local, cheap, ""unofficial"" versions in future.  Far less trouble and no disappointments.  If this is a crime, sue me.
