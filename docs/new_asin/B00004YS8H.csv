1378230,2,B00004YS8H,"This movie is also called ""Monster from a Prehistoric Planet"".  How do I know? I bought both!
This movie is about how monsters love their children as much as any person.  Its very stupid and worthless.  There are bad movies that are lovable and bad movies that should go in the trash. This is the later.",1068681600,,303,4.375
1378231,3,B00004YS8H,"There's not a whole lot I can say about this Japanese monster movie.  The head of Playmate magazine (which is apparently a much different magazine than the one you are thinking of) sends some of his people out to the South Sea Islands in search of exotic creatures for his Playmate Island building project.  He seems to think that people will flock to outdoor restaurants situated right in the middle of a tropical island full of strange wild beasts roaming around unfettered.  The team naturally heads toward the island with the most active volcano, scoff at native talk about a god-like being called Gappa, find a giant egg, and then kidnap the prehistoric hatchling and rush him back to Japan.  The scientists and the publisher fight over how to best mistreat the animal, and then Gappa's far from long-extinct parents show up to stomp around Japan for awhile in search of their little Gappa bundle of joy.  These monsters are rather unimpressive and hard to describe.  They can't decide if they want to fly, swim, or walk, and they have bird-like beaks and long, whip-enabled tails; I swear one of them has a fake beard, and the other one seems to adorn itself with a giant starfish goatee every so often.  Little Gappa isn't much better.  Naturally, there are all kinds of explosions and many model cities are destroyed, but the special effects are rather bland; while the monsters do spew out a few obligatory heat rays, they mainly just stomp around looking lost.  Strange as it may sound, the ending is actually sort of touching -- lame but touching.  The whole ordeal is not something a human being would look back on with any sort of pride, that's for sure.  Despite its many flaws, I actually enjoyed this movie; it can't hold a candle to Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, or Rodan movies, but it's really not that bad if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies.",1043971200,,1865,4.690184049079755
1378232,2,B00004YS8H,"Ok, I admit I'm a sucker for really bad cinema, and almost no one makes bad cinema as bad as this. It ranks right up there with the greatest suitmation monster stink bombs in history, including most of the Godzilla series between Godzilla vs King Kong and the Heisei series in the 1990s, and virtually all of the rest of the Toho and Toho-clone stable.  There is just something so delightfully awful about the attack of those giant chicken-slash-parrots that makes you want either to fall to the floor laughing or run screaming away from the television (maybe not such as bad thing...) never to watch again.  Anyone one familiar with the Red Dwarf TV series might recognize Gappa from one of the episodes as well.  I have an idea... Instead of the Golden Turkey, let's introduce the Golden Gappa!",1012262400,4,796,4.671428571428572
1378233,2,B00004YS8H,"The creatures in this film do get to do what monsters do best, and that's about all it has going for it. I was impressed with the amount of screen time dedicated to watching giant monsters trash villages, suburbs, cities, temples and factories. It makes me wish better monster movies spent more time with the monster, without losing the plot of course. Instead we get things like Cloverfield which barely shows any of the monster at all! They're called ""Monster"" Movies not ""Annoying Screaming People With Bad Camera Angles"" Movies. Although the problem with this movie is the 'special effects' aren't very special, and while the story follows the classic ""take baby monster away from parents, parents come to get their baby back and tear stuff up.""  theme, you've really got to be in the mood to watch this one.",1260748800,3,812,4.8
1378234,4,B00004YS8H,"Technically it's the same movie, but it is not the same dvd. I have (Monster From A Prehistoric Planet) on two different box sets. A 9 movie set simply called GIANT MONSTERS and a 50 movie pack called HORROR CLASSICS. The picture quality is much better in the 50 movie pack set. It maintains a better color level and is not nearly as dark and murky as in the Giant Monsters' set. But if you're really interested in expanding your daikaiju collection get the dvd entitled GAPPA THE TRIPHIBIAN MONSTER. This is shown in 2:35.1 widescreen and with a much better picture quality than any other version.

I now know where my goofy nose comes from!  I only wish that I could fly or have that laser beam thing come from my mouth - I did get the inherited ability to destruct things while just walking around, though.

Saw this film when I was a kid, and it's just as good to watch today. Seeing it in widesceen, and the original version is worth to own alone. People who don't care about japanese classic should not review this movie.",1198540800,,357,4.114285714285714

1378238,5,B00004YS8H,"I pray that the reviewers who buried this movie meant no real disrespect. You have to place this movie in context, i.e., the period, the technical capabilities of the time, and the budget. Yes, the special effects were cheesy. Some times though real, actual motion looks more realistic than animation. Digitally animated creatures are too perfect, therefore unrealistic in a bizzare way. Also, place Japanese monster movies in context. These creatures are a metaphor for the nuclear menace. Godzilla was radioactive, the Gappas have some sort of electrical field. Today, this context has been lost. Or has it?",1142985600,4,609,5.224489795918367
1378239,3,B00004YS8H,"SOMEBODY CALL COLONEL SANDERS!!! This movie is definatly one of the more uncommon and obscure films of the kaiju genre. I do vaguely remember seeing this film as a child and am sure I have heard the name ""Gappa"" before as well. Apparently, this film was Japan's answer the the United Kingdom's film Gorgo(1960). Haruyasu Noguchi is the director of the film and Gappa was his only  effort . Of the two films I have to say Gorgo was much more interesting with better special effects and an obviously larger budget. Gappa still deserves a viewing by die hard monster fans and DVD collectors alike.

A Japanese publisher of PlayMate magazine (porn mag?) sends some scientists out to the island of Obelisk to search for exotic creatures. The crew meet up with a young, sappy island kid with  some mud on his face and a cropped afro.  After some moronic dialogue and futile character introductions, the scientists steal a Gappa baby from a cave on the island.  Momma and Poppa Gappa emanate from the cave to discover that their little spud has been stolen from them. Both overgrown chickens proceed towards Tokyo and basically destroy everything in their paths. Check out the big starfish that one of the Gappa's carries in its beak when they first arrive in the city.....very cheesy!!!

1378240,3,B00004YS8H,"`Is that an island spewing fire?

Or is that a flying giant rock?

It's the true mystery of the universe,

The Triphibian monster Gappa!'

And that was the theme song that heralded my introduction to Gappa the Triphibian Monsters (1967) aka Monster from a Prehistoric Planet aka Daikyoj Gappa, a late entry into the Japanese giant monster craze of the mid to late 60s, and the only monster movie to be released by Nikkatsu Studios (according to the liner notes, the studio switched to the more profitable genre of softcore prior to going out of business).  Directed by Haruyasu Noguchi, and special effects by Akira Watanabe (Godzilla, Godzilla Raids Again, Rodan! The Flying Monster, Destroy All Monsters), the film features performances by Tamio Kawaji (The Weird Love Makers) and Yko Yamamoto (Duel in the Storm), among others.

Now I'd like to include some additional lyrics, based on what I saw last night...

`Yawn if you will, yawn if you might,

The Triphibian monsters are coming tonight,

Giant chickens attack Japan,

Run no further I have a plan,

Set the table, invite the guests,

With my culinary skills I shall impress,

So little children don't you cry,

Would you like breast, wing, or thigh?'

Okay, I may never get an offer for a recording contract, but at least my addition was on par with the original material.  As the film begins we learn of a crew of scientists and journalists traveling on a cargo ship to Obelisk Island, located somewhere in South Seas.  Seems they were hired by a wealthy, Japanese publisher to retrieve rare and exotic plant and animal samples, which will become part of a plan that includes opening an amusement park on one of these remote islands...a super fantastic Hello Kitty business venture, if you ask me...anyway, the ship arrives at the island, which is complete with erupting volcano, a small native village, and a really annoying native boy named Saki, and begin exploring, against the protests of the natives, as they fear the awakening of Gappa, whom the explorers assume is some local deity hokum.  In a cave, under the volcano, they find not only a lake, but also a giant egg, which begins to hatch after some ground tremors (did I mention the volcano is spewing forth hot magma?).  From within the egg something gooey this way comes, in the form of a mucus swathed lizard creature, which the explorers capture and take back with them to Japan...definitely not a good idea, as, after they've gone, something stirs in the underground lake...two somethings, to be exact.  Seems the slimy, reptilian infant had parents, and they're none too please to see someone has since buggered off with their offspring.  After a less than exciting rampage on the local village (thatch huts crush pretty easily), the terrible twosome use some sort of innate homing senses to locate junior, which leads them to Japan, which leads to much more satisfying things to crush, smash, and destroy (thankfully).  It's collateral damage a go-go as Gappa squared unleash their angry fury proving yet again one shouldn't come between giant, fire breathing monster chickens and their children.

I'll tell you what, I'm no expert on the kaij eiga (monster pictures) genre, but I have seen a few, and Gappa seems like a lesser entry.  It's just so boring...we don't see any monsters until about a half hour in, and even then it's the wee one hatched from the egg.  We then have to wait another half hour before we actually get some action, as that's when the adult creature rise from their watery respite in search of their baby.  An hour is just too long to make the viewers for this kind of film to wait for any real carnage.  As I said, I haven't seen a whole lot of these films, but others have said there's really nothing new within the story here, and I'd be inclined to believe them as I found myself oh so tempted to fast forward through the parts of the film that dragged (I didn't).  The main strength for this viewer was in the technical aspects, provided by Akira Watanabe.  Some of it was lacking, but then some of it was really well done.  I thought the cities had quite a bit of detail, especially in terms of the monsters destroying buildings, which didn't fall apart like crummy, stacked blocks, but real, honest to goodness structures.  I also thought some of the background sets and lighting aspects done really well.  The destruction of the industrial sector was pretty cool, as was the brief, tidal wave sequence.  As far as the rest, it was all disposable.  The monsters were just goofy.  They had beaks and wings like a bird, the body (and tail) of a lizard, walked on two legs, could fly, and tended to spend a lot of time underwater.  Oh yeah, they also could breath fire.  The story's simplistic, which I normally wouldn't have minded in this type of film, but it's simplicity loaded with sappy `touching moments', especially near the end (fire more rockets, damnit!).  And then there's that little native boy...is it written in stone somewhere that every, single one of these film must include a really annoying child presence?  If so, they certainly met the requirement here.  And you really have to see the kid's appearance to believe it...in trying to pass him off as a South Seas native, the filmmakers took a Japanese boy, covered him in shoe polish, and made him wear a shaved Afro wig.  The result is an oriental boy who looks like he's been in the oven an hour too long (I like mine medium rare).  The other aspect that really annoyed me was how much time was spent by the characters discussing the virtues of their actions with respect to taking the monster baby.  There were basically three groups, the greedy publisher bastich wanted to keep the little runt (it was to be the centerpiece of his theme park), the scientist were interested in research, and then those empathetic to the familial instincts apparently present within the creatures...whatever...SMASH!  CRUSH!  DESTROY!  That's what we came to see...there was some of this, but not nearly enough.

Media Blasters/ Shock Tokyo provides a good-looking widescreen (2.35:1) print on this DVD, but it's not without flaws.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through cleanly.  There's a choice available on this DVD to watch the film with the original dialog with English subtitles, or the film with English dubbing.  I preferred the former, but the inclusion of both was nice.  There really isn't much in terms of special features, other than some informative liner notes.  There are a couple different DVD releases of this film floating around, and Amazon like to mix all the reviews together, so be wary of which version you're getting if interested.  Something odd...as I write this, Amazon lists the film at a running time of 60 minutes, but it was more like 90 minutes.

By the way, it wasn't entirely clear, but it seemed the theme park was meant to be constructed on Obelisk Island, near the spewing volcano...an excellent location, if you ask me.",1126569600,21,6993,4.7825
1378241,1,B00004YS8H,"This movie holds a special distinction in my heart, one that I wish to impart with everyone here.  This is the only movie that simply, truthfully, and honestly, put me to sleep in 30 minutes.  The acting was golden, and you couldn't tell at all that it was just hastily dubbed into English with extremely Cheesy Dick Van Dyke-esque voices that made their poor Japanese actor counterparts look like buffoons.  However, the joys and Eternal Elation does not end there.  The special effects were every bit as amazing and realistic as those from ""Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park.""  For any of you who have not seen either movie, then you are sorely missing out in the world of fly-by-night unrealistic ""effects"" that could better be produced in QBASIC on a 386 running DOS.  The plot was pretty much ripped off from every other monster movie in existence, so if you really want to watch a cheesy and enjoyable monster movie, watch one of the ten million ""Godzilla"" reincarnations or ""The Stuff"", and leave this one to the fact that there are quite simply things out there that man was not meant to experience or know.",1074384000,,1116,4.6395939086294415

7927706,2,B00004YS8H,"Monster from a Prehistoric Planet, 1967 film

A merchant ship sails the ocean. A woman reads a book on deck. A man runs to the radio shack for a message. They show the officials of Playmate Magazine. The publisher has a plan for a resort, Playmate Land. There is a movie at night, the ship shakes as if it hit something. One man tells of a huge monster fish! But its gone. A bad dream? They see a volcanic island with a stone statue from a lost civilization. Can it be inhabited? They hear drumming. [Are they armed?] The people greet them with joy. There is dancing, the sounds are recorded. Can these people be relocated to Japan? A young boy talks about Kappa. There is an earthquake! It reveals a cave. The visitors explore it. A lake under a volcano? They find a big skeleton, then a large egg.

There is another earthquake; the egg begins to hatch. No touch! says the young boy. The natives blame the visitors for the disturbances. Inside the cave there is a strange being. They have a lizard in a cage, the scientist wants to use it for research. Back in Japan the publisher talks about the expedition. Two-legged creatures appear at night, the natives scream! A USN submarine appears offshore. The publisher plans to smuggle that lizard into Japan to create a sensation. This causes Playmate Land to fail. They will tame this animal and teach it a few tricks. The lizard is growing, how big will it grow? It gives off sparks, like a monster. That submarine is being followed. Two unidentified flying objects are seen in the airspace of Japan.

A monster lands from the sea, people scream and run! Buildings collapse when the monster walks on them! Military units are called to destroy this menace. Army trucks fire their cannons without any effect. The monsters fiery breath destroys tanks. Jet fighter planes fire their rockets to no avail! The fighters are destroyed by the monsters fiery breath. Then the monsters fly away to the sea. Everyone buys their magazine. How can these monsters be stopped? They plan to use ultra-sound at 30K to get them out of the lake so missiles can kill them. That native boy says should send the baby monster back to the parents. The ultrasound generators create noise to drive the monsters out of the lake. Rockets are launched against them! Keep firing! A tidal wave destroys housing. The monsters approach Tokyo. People watch the monsters arrive. Their baby greets them. The terror is over, the Kappa fly away to return to their island. All is well. Its all over says one man. We shouldnt be selfish. Will there be a happy future for this woman?

This is amusing for its attitudes. It is like other classic horror movies: a monster appears to threaten the people, they unite and answer the threat, and the problem goes away. The choice of a monster is funny - a big being would need a huge wingspan to fly through the air. Would it also have a long lizard tail? Not likely, its non-functional dead weight. But horror monsters are irrational. They symbolize a threat to people. The book Hollywood Horror by Mark Vieira offes explanations for the appeal of these movies, which become popular during difficult economic times.",1482278400,,3168,4.651785714285714

I love giant monster movies from the 50s and 60s. Incomparable fun. You really ought to at least see this movie. If you collect old sci fi monster movies, you've GOTTA buy a copy while this is still available. These are really old movies by this time!
