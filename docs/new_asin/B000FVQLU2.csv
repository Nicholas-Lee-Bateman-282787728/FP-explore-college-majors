8127324,4,B000FVQLU2,"This is a review for  OUTLAWS OF BOULDER PASS (1942) dby Sam Nuefield.......... MUSIC FROM HIS THROAT, DEATH FROM HIS GUNS! AND BORDER BADMEN RUN TO COVER AS THIS FELLOW RIDES THE RANGE..............

Gil Harkness, played by veteran bad guy I. Stanford Jolley, controls Boulder Pass and is overcharging  tolls for ranchers who need to get through the  natural built bottleneck. Tom Cameron, as The Lone Rider, played by George Houston, robs the toll takers to return the money to the ranchers but is caught by Harkness and has to figure a way out of the mess.

George Houston is a pretty interesting hero and this is a entertainingly decent ""B"" Western featuring the likes of Dennis Moore, Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John, Charles King and Marjorie Manners.

I give this enjoyable ""B"" western, OUTLAWS OF BOULDER PASS, Four Stars.",1284076800,2,818,4.848920863309353
8127325,3,B000FVQLU2,"Specifically regarding Alpha Video's DVD release of Outlaws of Boulder Pass w/When A Man's A Man. This is a typical Alpha release which means adequate if nothing else is available.

The source print for Outlaws is a soft, 16mm dupe with many dark shots or scenes even during outdoor daylight. There are intermittent missing frames and much surface noise. However, this PRC released film is somewhat rare with George Houston as the Lone Rider.  The second feature from Atherton Productions also is  obscure. However, the source print was in better condition than Outlaws but is slightly soft while the stock shots are very soft. There are some missing frames and light to moderate surface noise.

I don't think these two films on one disc are worth more than one dollar plus shipping charges, especially since the film of greater interest is of poor quality.",1173398400,,857,4.930555555555555
