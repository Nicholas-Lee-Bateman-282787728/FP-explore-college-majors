8074176,4,B000A3944U,"Just saw this film at a local Italian Film Festival and it easily was the best film of the fest, and one of the best movies I've seen all year. For adults only, but worth the watch when and IF it ever comes to the USA (wake-up acquisitions people!!!)

Italian actor Sergio Castellito (""Mostly Martha"") proves to be a more than capable director with only his second film ""Don't Move."" Although the film opens in the present with a motorbike accident in the rain, it quickly heads 15 years back in time in order to develop the main storyline of an adulterous young doctor who makes an odd acquaintance in the countryside.

What follows is a highly interesting and complicated storyline that will enthrall adult audiences for the film's entire two hour running time. Castellito also stars in the film as 'Dr.'Timo', a surgeon with no moral compass who, while waiting for his car to be fixed, gets drunk and 'date'-rapes a strange woman who up to this point has only acted as a good Samaritan on the doctor's behalf.

This oddball beginning is only part of the atypical but highly involving elements that make this film so intriguing and may send some viewers to the bookstores to seek out the Margaret Mazzantini novel on which it is based. As the two main characters continue their trysts, their relationship evolves from chronic, somewhat violent sexual assaults to full-blown lovemaking.

Being poorly educated and of limited means, the woman, 'Italia', grows in affection for the doctor as his treatment of her begins to shift from victim to paid whore to lover to true love. Giving her most amazing acting performance to date is Spanish-born Penelope Cruz (""Vanilla Sky""), who not only shows a facility for the Italian language but also the capability of creating a believable portrayal of a basically, very unattractive woman.

Italia has blackened teeth, overdoes her make-up, and dresses like a peasant (she's employed as a seasonal worker at a local hotel), but her firm legs are enough of an attraction to keep bringing the horny Dr. Timo back for more for years to come. The only false note in this scenario is the appearance of Timo's wife, the absolutely, gorgeous Claudia Gerini (""I'm Crazy About Iris Blond""), as the doctor's severely negelected wife. Luckily, this pseudo 'madonna-whore' aspect to the the storyline is the only glitch in an almost perfect scenario.

Although many Italian movies deal with the theme of adultery, this film portrays the growing passion between the lovers in extremely dramatic terms while continuously defying cliched situations. Clever surprises as well as the parallel storyline in the present are used in a way that will stun viewers anticipating something more derivative. Certainly the most original Italian filmmaking that I've seen since the work of director Federico Fellini in the 50's and 60's, and kudo's to Castellito for both starring in and directing this marvelous drama which will hopefully get a USA theatrical release (it did).",1143417600,2,2990,4.97
8074177,4,B000A3944U,"First of all, I have only been mildly impressed by Penelope Cruz in Head In The Clouds, All About My Mother, and loved her spicy role in Woman On Top. I think she's this decade's most successful Spanish imported actress, but she still hasn't struck a great role in Hollywood. Director/star Sergio Castellito has offered a great role for Cruz in this film, because she's practically deglamourized and trashy looking, which is very different from her signature glamour queen image. This is a great opportunity for her to capture the audiences heart with a heavy duty and emotionally impacting performance. She certainly held her own opposite the equally brilliant Castellito.

This film is love, lust and infidelity, and it can easily be compared to Unfaithful, but it's more erotic, daring, and visually striking. Castellito plays a successful surgeon with a loving wife and daughter. One day, her daughter was hospitalized as a result of near fatal accident, and he started to get flashbacks of a woman(Italia/Cruz) he once loved and died from improper abortion. Italia initially was just a prostitute to him, and they met up on a weekly basis, but they gradually fell in love with each other. He hesitated to leave his wife for Italia, and when she got pregnant, she chose to have an abortion, since she couldn't become his wife.....

Sergio is a real fine actor, and he carried the film from beginning to end. He has numerous sexy and stimulating love scenes with Cruz, and they had a great deal of chemistry together. Their performances really made this film more captivating, and they certainly deserved the acting awards in Europe.",1123200000,6,1636,4.945454545454545
8074178,4,B000A3944U,"Dr. Timoteo Rossi (Sergio Castellitto) has the perfect life: a beautiful wife Elsa (the glorious Claudia Gerini), a smart daughter and a medical practice that is the envy of all his friends.
There is only one problem, though he loves his daughter, he's not really in love with Elsa because he can't get Italia (Penelope Cruz) out of his mind, thoughts and even actions. Everything reminds him of Italia and his brief but fervent affair with her.
Castellitto, who also directs here, has fashioned his film with more than a nod towards Roberto Rossellini and the Italian Neo-Realism films of the 1950's: Cruz is even made up to look like a new millennium Sophia Loren. But that is about the only similarity between the two for Cruz has a tenderness and vulnerability as Italia that Loren never had and that Cruz has never, up to this point, exhibited on the screen.
Cruz's Italia is average looking and takes nothing for granted: she is content with having only as much as Timoteo is willing to give her, as she says to him: ""I don't care if you come back once a week, once a month or once a year...just come back.""
There is a heart-breaking scene close to the end of the film between Italia and Timo that is performed only in close-ups: the camera moving back and forth between the two, which is a textbook treatise on film acting: eyes, face, eyes... that says volumes without any dialogue.
Castellitto, so good as an actor in ""Mostly Martha,"" has directed a film with a master's eye. His scene compositions are beautiful and his astute sensibilities, particularly in the scenes between Timo and Italia, mark him as a director in possession of uncommon grace and a transcendant inner fire that hopefully will stay light for many films to come.",1120867200,8,1743,4.680781758957655
