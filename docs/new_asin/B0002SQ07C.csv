8031435,5,B0002SQ07C,Great product just like all of the Woodland Scenics stuff. I advised everyone on Planet Earth to buy it ASAP.,1402617600,,109,4.5
8031436,2,B0002SQ07C,"This DVD is very informative and pushes their own products heavily but that's ok since most of us would buy their products anyway.

I found the video quality of the DVD to be just horrible.  It was very difficult to see details of what the instructors were doing on the scenery.

Also the video person spent far too much time panning faces in the audience.  I am far more interested in seeing the instruction than faces in the crowd.",1218758400,,433,4.443037974683544
8031437,4,B0002SQ07C,"This is an infomercial pure and simple but it is a worthwhile one. Woodland Scenics makes an amazing variety of scenery products for use with model railroads (and other applications). Using them is simple but not always intuitive. This program in a tutorial produced by the company to teach the use of the product at an NMRA event.

The program probably makes using the products seem a bit more simple than it really is but it does show the potential of the products and teach how to use many of them. That is the purpose for which I bought it and I am not disappointed. It is well done and make the long commercial worthwhile.",1179100800,,627,4.452173913043478
