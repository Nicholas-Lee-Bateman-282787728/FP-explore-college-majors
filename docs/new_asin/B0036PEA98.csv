8390131,5,B0036PEA98,"BOTTOM LINE: Fans of Ultraman should eat this up. This 2009 theatrical release has a strong story, solid direction and good cinematography. Outstanding fight scenes take up the majority of the film's 90 minute runtime, so if you prefer lots of human-based drama then you'll have to search elsewhere. Though a Japanese produced release, I'm happy to report that this legitmate R1 Blu-ray plays flawlessly in U.S. machines, with no need for special codes or whatnot. Best of all, the film sports a terrific English language subtitling job that actually appears to have been overseen by someone who fluently speaks BOTH languages. Tons of old school monster fun, this release easily rates a solid 5 STARS.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): An evil, exiled Ultraman (Belial) is freed from his eternal imprisonment. He's obtained a powerful weapon: the Giga Battlenizer, which has the ability to control monsters & villainous aliens. Belial first resurrects an army of creatures with it, then sets out to kill all of his fellow Ultras and destroy their home world of M78 by stealing its source of power: the Plasma Spark. To stop Belial's evil scheme it will take the combined powers of all of the Ultramen, but to emerge victorious these brave space warriors must seek out another former Ultra who, like Belial, also once attempted to steal the Plasma Spark. His awesome fighting skills could turn the tide but can he be trusted? Will he join the Ultra Warriors and fight for peace ...or will he side with Belial to enslave the universe??

THOUGHTS: Over the decades, most ULTRAMAN shows have followed a pretty rigid formula: 90% of each show is about the science team who investigate & battle various threats to Earth, while the last 10% is Ultraman fighting the monster-of-the-week. With this feature film, that formula is turned on its head. This entire movie is focused on the Ultra beings. It follows their fight to survive and their internal struggles to deal with evil within their own kind; something utterly unheard of among their people. We get to see the Land of Light, (their home planet in Nebula M78), in all its glory. In addition, there's also some intriguing back history about the Ultras' world and how these unique beings came to be. These glimpses are neat, but the fighting is front & center here. Almost 75 of the movie's 90 minutes are dedicated to Ultras battling one another, and those same Warriors also mixing it up with literally dozens of their classic foes. Impressively, almost every single Ultra being ever created is featured; some in large roles, others in blink & you'll miss them cameos. (They even had live-action suits made for the 3 Ultra beings from the obscure 1987 animated film produced by Hanna-Barbera & Tsuburaya, called ULTRAMAN: The Adventure Begins!) In fact, the only Ultras I didn't see were Jonias, Zearth, Cosmos and Nice, (but I will certainly be watching this again and I'll hit the pause here & there to see if I can spot them). The action sequences are blistering and the fighting is well choreographed. The use of CGI allows the Ultra Warriors to show off some slick new fighting abilities that their respective shows' limited F/X budgets & old school miniature/suitmation techniques simply couldn't achieve back in the day. And old school fans of the original 1966 ULTRAMAN series will be delighted to find original ""Hayata"" actor, Susumu Kurobe, still alive & kicking. Although in his late 60's when this was shot, Kurobe proves that he's up to the challenge, delivering his dialogue & action bits with equal gusto. Majorly cool.

THE BLU-RAY: Although a minimal, feature-only release, this single disc effort sports a solid hi-def transfer. Crisp, strong picture with only minimal artifacting & pixelation. The bright, vivid color schemes of our heroes & their monster opponents are well-represented, along with solid inky blacks in the outer space scenes. As far as the audio portion of this Blu-ray goes, the 5.1 soundmix is clear, level and loud, (seriously!). There are no bonus features per se, but as I mentioned up at the top of my review this disc (released by Warner Bros.) has a really nice set of English subtitles. They're clear, clean, easy to read & well-translated. (No wonky Chinese bootleg knock-off subs here!) Unfortunately, for those who don't like to ""read"" their movies there's no English-dubbed audio track, but even without a dub, the excellent English sub option makes this fun flick a no-brainer recommendation. [Please note: The menu & submenu screens are in Japanese text, but it only took a few trial & error attempts to navigate thru them to turn on the English subs.] Also be aware that this is not a cheap disc (I paid $30), plus ordering it directly from Japan meant that I had to wait 6 weeks from the time I placed my order until the day it showed up in my mailbox. Still, if you love Ultraman then this terrific film is well worth the price and the wait. 5 STARS!",1478044800,3,4954,4.860355029585799
