2714160,5,B000LV639K,"A very interesting insight into the events that followed the invasion of Crete in 1941.  This film goes a long way in demonstrating the patriotism of the people of Crete under extreme circumstances.  It also shows the fellowship between the people of Crete and their allies from the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  Living in Tavronitis, this film has a considerable amount of local history.  Well done to the makers.",1312070400,3,416,4.9
2714161,5,B000LV639K,"Having heard stories about the German occupation of Crete years ago when I lived there, I was interested to learn more about this time in history from a Cretan point of view. I found several books and this film on Amazon, and ordered a selection from those most highly recommended.  This is a memorable film about the struggle of local partisans against the occupying Germans and I would recommend it to anyone--it accurately displays the intense pride of the Cretan people, and their desperate determination to drive out yet another occupying force as they have repeatedly done in the past for centuries.  I particularly like the way events are portrayed through real life stories and photographs of those who participated in this rebellion.  I found it fascinating!",1290902400,7,767,5.0236220472440944
2714162,5,B000LV639K,"This is a great documentary of the untold story of the Battle of Crete, which began on May 20th, 1941 (a few months after my father was born on this island of Greece).

8164235,5,B000LV639K,"This is a chapter of World War II that is often shamefully overlooked by historians.  Not many people know that the large Mediterranean island of Crete was invaded by the Nazis, and that some of the bravest and proudest warriors this world has known (Cretans), were able to hold onto their island and heritage until the Germans receded after 4 years.  Their indomitable spirit and will to persevere is legendary, even after suffering unspeakable horrors and losses at the hands of the ruthless and subhuman German war machine!  The Cretans were the most successful anti-German 'resistance' group of WW II, and this great documentary tells the story.  A 'must see'!",1385164800,,664,5.009090909090909

8164237,5,B000LV639K,"This is an amazing documentary, with the real war veterans involved in the resistance giving interviews. With great footage and re-enactments, i was thoroughly immersed in their stories. A very sad story but also heroic. This battle was a major factor which determined the allies victory due to the Nazis being delayed in Crete/Greece long enough so when the Nazis reached Russia they experienced the middle of the coldest Winter.",1360281600,,430,5.1571428571428575
