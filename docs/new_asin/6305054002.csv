7881397,5,6305054002,"...Because you get ""as advertised"". I was searching for DVD's as a gift for my elderly aunt who likes classical music, but didn't know composers...nor do I. I found Canyon Suites 1st and picked it to remind her of our ''76 trip to the ""Canyon"".

 I searched many Classical DVD's, but the more I looked the more confusing it became. So I recommend this DVD for two reasons. If you are a ""Classical"" idiot, as I, Canyon Suites gives you a taste of a variety of the most famous composers. Yes, now I can buy what I know I'll like.

 The second reason is more close to my heart. The Southwest-""Canyon"" area is the most exotic area of our country. Living in Colorado, I know our Red Rocks connect to the Canyon's. I wish everyone could experience the vastness of both the sky and the land of this area; to know we are part of it, but not superior to it. Canyon Suites depicts a land the Native Peoples flurished within and the whiteman only thought of, and still thinks of, as ""waste"" to be ""tread on"" and through.

 Buy this DVD so you will know a delicate land better...and enjoy well scored music.",1141257600,6,1095,4.3431372549019605
