8671871,4,B00MEXA90C,"One of the best, most comprehensive documentaries covering all aspects and both theaters of WWII. Unfortunately, this collection is missing the half-hour documentaries that were part of the original series. No, these missing episodes do not detract from the greatness of this documentary but really should have been included as this claims to be ""the entire complete series"". Not sure why they were included in the VHS box set and not this DVD set. According to WIKI: ""Some footage and interviews which were not used in the original series were later made into additional hour or half-hour documentaries narrated by Eric Porter. These were released as a bonus to the VHS version and are included in the DVD set of the series, first released in 2002.
