4651391,1,B005C4F5I6,"It's a horrible adaptation of the 1959 version with Maricruz Olivier, which was far better than this one.  They made another version in 1989 with Salma Hayek which was also crappy, and now this.  :(

What can I say?  They changed the ending to an inconsistent and dumb ending.  Televisa makes nothing but remakes, and HORRIBLE remakes at best!!  :S",1331769600,,348,4.716666666666667
4651392,1,B005C4F5I6,"The usual Mexican soap romantic love quadrangle or greater with the usual femme fatale cheating, lying, deception, argument, back stabbing, manipulation all taking place within a small group of lovers, family and friends. Predictable wealth vs. poverty, greed vs. sacrifice. The usual overly narcissistic tight clothing displaying the skill of pumping iron and the skill of breast enhancement. Ironies: First, this soap film culture is taking place under the purview of the Catholic Church. Second, that it's to a poorly educated and financially strapped audience similar to what Bollywood essentially does to its poorly educated and trapped in poverty audience. Third, that there is invariably a Catholic Church wedding scene and all you see are elaborate theatrical costuming and immense, elaborate gold plated carvings. Perhaps symbolic of the billions of dollars in Vatican and diocese wealth while simultaneously, in order to keep the flock impoverished and obedient, is a Parish education system that throttles a questioning creative intelligence oriented curriculum. Not much of a future on Earth but sacrificing for the next ... - ideology.

Oh, the soap! Standard read a line; give a facial tantrum or tear; pan to the next person and repeat for eight hours. Some die, some get married and some repent.",1329609600,4,1311,5.364077669902913
4651393,4,B005C4F5I6,"Por Fin Salio esta Telenovela En Dvd, ya era hora...
Estoy Super Contento y Con Muchas Ganas de Tener el Dvd Ya!!! Sin Dudas Teresa ha sido una de las Mejores Telenovelas de el 2011 y Me Encanto!!!
No veo la hora de que llegue el Da del Lanzamiento para Comprarla, aunque faltan Ms de 2 Meses todavia...
24/1/2012: Me Encanto el Dvd, Contiene un Resumen con Lo Mas Importante de la Historia, las Mejores Escenas, Esta Bien Editado y tiene coherencia, a pesar de que no tiene casi todas las Peleas de Teresa, Aida y Oriana, las voy a extraar mucho, me encantaban y me decilusione mucho cuando vi que no las tenia, sinceramente reconosco que hasta el momento que empeze a verlo aun conservaba la esperanza de que esas escenas estubieran en el Dvd.
Tambien le falta casi todo lo referente a Ruben, el padre de Aida y Esperanza, se vuelve muy confuso todo ya que recortaron las partes escenciales de la Historia de ellos, sobre todo el escandalo que se arma con Esperanza. En el Resumen las peleas de Aida con Teresa no estan como tampoco aquella escena en que Oriana y Aida van a conocer la casa donde vive Teresa en la vecindad y se burlan de ella, Teresa les toma una foto y jura vengarse, solo se ve cuando hablan de que ellas fueron a verla pero no esta esa escena, que la verdad, me habia encantado y queria que estubiera en el Dvd.
La Duracion del Dvd es de 14 Horas y 56 Minutos y Ademas Contiene Material Adicional, El Final Alternativo 1, El Final Alternativo 2 y Detras de Camaras con los Actores.
Exelente Dvd, Muy Recomendable!!!",1321833600,10,1538,4.419014084507042

4651403,5,B005C4F5I6,This is a wonderful Telenovela i have seen it already four times and never get sick of watching it.  Pity that it will not be extended to see the full realization of Arturo and Teresa's life once they reconciled.  Again there was too much drama with the plot and the characters in it but loved the love scenes between Arturo and Teresa.  I abhore the fickelness of Aurora who ditch Martin i found that to be truly cruel on her part knowing that Mariano was with Teresa in the beginning she should have stuck to her principals and stick to Marting. As for Aida such a violent character she should check herself under physchiatric care i did not like her at all it obscure the sensibility of the telenovela. But Angelique acting was outstanding she is so talented in expressing her facial emotions. I rate this 10 out of 10. I wished this telenovela be extended to see how Arturo and Teresa's life get on for good.  Be interesting i guess it is my number one telenovela.,1484265600,,968,4.451977401129944

4651405,2,B005C4F5I6,"Jams podr comparar la calidad de la historia adaptada a DVD, versus la original transmitida en televisin.

Si bien es cierto que durante su transmisin  por televisin en el ao 2014, siempre hice nfasis que una de sus grandes joyas era la minuciosidad y estructura positiva de su guion, en esta versin de DVD, este dej mucho que desear, demeritando totalmente una trama que originalmente conmovi e impact a toda su audiencia a lo largo de Amrica Latina.

Recordemos que el xito de una produccin audiovisual no recae nicamente en sus buenas locaciones, arte, sonido, musicalizacin, fotografa, post-produccin o un elenco de peso; si una de bases fundamentales, (como el guion), est dbil e inconsistente, la globalidad de su producto se ver afectada.

Por ejemplo...Rubn, Genoveva, Fito, aparecen una vez a lo largo de la historia. Nunca se ve cuando Fito le vende droga a Paulo y de la nada vemos a un Paulo agonizante (sin explicacin alguna). Es all cuando me pregunt: ""Cmo es que este individuo muri de la nada?  Hacen referencia a Patty muchas veces sin haber salido antes en pantalla. La mam de Teresa le pregunta que cmo sigui de su cara,  (cmo sigui de qu?), si cortaron la parte donde Aida le echa cido en la cara, pero dejaron la parte donde Refugio le pregunta acerca de su cara. Nunca sale la parte donde muere Fito, ni donde Mariano queda en la crcel, ni siquiera sale el secuestro del beb de Esperanza y de la nada y sin explicacin previa, Esperanza est llorando por su beb. Nunca sale nada de cmo el doctor conquist a Esperanza, de la nada salen juntos y felices, sin prembulo alguno. Mayra la esposa de Rubn slo sale al final, nunca salen todas las infidelidades y fechoras que l hizo y como no sale lo de su muerte en la crcel (por lo mismo que no se incluy todo el desarrollo de su personaje) el destino de tan importante personaje (en su versin original) queda inconcluso e intrascendente en esta pseudo versin de dvd.

Y as, el guin tiene una y mil inconsistencias ms.

La historia es buena, por supuesto que s, ms su versin en dvd no refleja esa calidad, porque algo tan prioritario como su guion, fue dejado a un lado y pas a segundo plano.

Exhorto a Televisa Home Entertainment a que se esmere en sus futuras adaptaciones a dvd, porque con un buen trabajo de edicin se puede rescatar la belleza del guion sin perder al espectador en una trama confusa. Se puede cortar contenido sin que pierda su fondo y estructura. Si no son suficientes 3 o 4 discos, pues utilicen los que sean necesarios, pero asegrense de entregar al pblico un producto de alta calidad. Rescatable el que se haya dejado la banda sonora original conjuntamente con la musica incidental.

La madastra, Rub, Volver a empezar, La mujer de mi vida, fueron cortadas pero las disfrut porque fueron consistentes todo el tiempo y no quedaron en tramas dbiles, su nuevo guin resumido tuvo la fuerza y trascendencia esperada, lo que no sucedi con Teresa y su intento fallido de adaptacin a dvd.",1480377600,5,2970,4.607954545454546

4651408,4,B005C4F5I6,"Some similarities to the soap ""ruby.""

Teresa is smart and pretty, but becomes fed up with her family's poverty. She has a poor boyfriend, but becomes involved with a wealthy lawyer.

She marries the lawyer, then becomes confused about her feelings for her old boyfriend vs. her husband.

As the story progresses, she becomes increasingly manipulative and uncertain if she wants to stay with her husband and increasingly willing to use her looks to pursue greater wealth.",1475625600,,471,5.090909090909091

Second choice is around $16.00 (from another seller)but the cheaper one is the best way to go. This DVD does include 4 DVDS and each about 4 hours long total 16 hrs. I started watching it as soon as I got home. It brought back so many memories. I agree it does cut off a lot of parts,but they add scenes so you can better understand the parts they couldn't add. I love the romance between Teresa and Mariano they DO NOT CUT ANY OFF THOSE PARTS OUT. LOVE IT! I can literally feel the emotions of Mariano being heart broken by Teresa. She rarely says her catchy phrase ""Entre ser o no ser yo soy "" Its basically kept short, and simple so you can understand the telenovela and they skip to the juicy parts!",1417478400,4,806,4.140127388535032

All the side stories not directly linked to Teresa were cut out and they are essential to make sense of the full story. The full serie is a five star but this particular item deserves no star.

A sweet, bright teenager is attending a posh high school on a scholarship but one of her wealthy classmates ""outs"" her and humiliates her. Teresa (Angelique Boyer) swears she will succeed in life, so we watch as her character changes; little by little, she becomes ruthless, conniving, mendacious and cruel. Her one sustaining passion is Mariano (Aaron Diaz), a childhood friend who is equally obsessed with her.

She obtains another scholarship, this time to law school and her professor Arturo (Sebastian Rulli) hires her to do legal work for him as a part-time job. Eventually, she seduces him into marrying her, even though she has sex with Mariano the night before their wedding.

Teresa relishes being wealthy and her two main men go ballistic any time they see one another; then, because he had guaranteed some loans for a friend (who commits suicide), Arturo goes bankrupt. By then, following her urging, Mariano has finished medical school and become a doctor. Now HE's the wealthy one and her husband is NOT. Drama ensues....

Now, if you're stuck on any of the secondary relationships, like Aida, Cutberto, Juanita, etc. youll be disappointed. These videos cut those scenes and compact it all so it really just follows Teresa and her dealings with Alejandro and Fernando. I love this soap, and these videos were prefect to finish what Netflix started.",1524182400,,485,5.0

He actually found this one on his own on Netflix but didn't get to finish it before it was taken off so he ordered it on here and we finished it together. It's a great Novela but what I really appreciated was that it came with English subtitles so that my husband could follow along. Hence, it get's 5 stars from me",1511913600,,417,4.160493827160494
