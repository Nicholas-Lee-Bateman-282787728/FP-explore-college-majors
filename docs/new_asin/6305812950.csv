1078437,5,6305812950,"this volume is the last, and probably the best in the series. it contains four episodes: PARADISE, SIN, LIVE THROUGH, & UNDER THE SKY SO BLUE. in these episodes, the goofeycomedy is cut to a minimun. stil there is allways an ocasional gigle here and there. anyway, these episodes fill in the last piece of the puzzel of the story. it explains how this whole adventure really began. and ends with the wonderful thrilling battle of Vash Vs. his evil brother knives.
PARADISE- tells the story of Wolfwoods's past and how far he has come for nothing. Vash feeeling guilty as he fails to save another persons life allmost has a breakdown.
Sin- Legado is ordered by Knives to cause Vash to experience eternal pain and suffering! His way of doing that, is to force Vash to kill Legado and make that guilt burn into his mind.
Live Through- Vash is reccovering from his wounds from the last battle but is still assamed of himself for what he had done. The two insurence girls Millie and Marril help him to live through this and help his mind to recover as well.
Under The Sky So Blue- The final fight between Vash and Knives. Tells the story of how vash learned of his Angel Arms and how his 130 year adventure had come to metting Knives again.
-My thoughts- I think this is the best volume of this series. if you have been following the show buy this but if you havent, start with the early volumes in order! this show will make no sense other wise!",996192000,,1441,4.421052631578948
1078438,5,6305812950,"I love this series and I can watch it again and again.. This was the finale of the series, unfortunately..  Wolfwood dies, which ..., because he's just starting to get close (in that way) to Milly. And now she's all alone to watch Vash and Meryl get together...  Anyways, it was really good. I especially liked the gunfight between Vash and Knives. It was so awesome, you will watch it over and over. Vash overtakes knives and tosses his gun and red coat aside, to carry his brother over his shoulder back home, and start a new ""normal"" life. He didn't kill him, he wants to 'save' him.. Good luck I say!  All in all, it is a must have if you have been following the series.. You will not be disappointed, except to the fact that the series has come to a close..... -Sephariel",995500800,,776,4.337931034482758
1078439,5,6305812950,"It had to end sometime.  One of the latest and greatest anime series of all time concludes with, appropriately, ""High Noon"".  It's sad to see it end, but oh boy, what an ending.  (Warning: If you haven't seen the first seven volumes of 'Trigun', don't worry; you might enjoy this one anyway.)  The heat that has been building up as main anti-hero Vash the Stampede reluctantly works his way through the ""Final Four"" of the Gung-Ho Guns (Midvalley the Horn Freak, Chapel the Evergreen, Caine, and the ultra-cruel Legato) to get to his arch-nemesis Knives finally reaches its boiling point.  The grown-up Knives finally makes his first (and last) full appearance in this volume, and just in time.  The encounters Vash has with the Gung-Hos are full of intensity and action all the way through this series, and these last ones are the most intense of all.  Vash's buddy/sidekick Nick Wolfwood accompanies Vash through some of the action, especially since he's got a big bone to pick with Chapel, the man who turns out to be his former mentor(!).  The two have themselves a good old-fashioned showdown in the middle of town as Vash continues to work his way to Knives, and it's pretty sweet.  When Vash confronts Legato, what results is one of the most emotional climaxes to a battle in recent anime history; you've just got to see it for yourself.  In my opinion, it even outdoes the final battle between Vash and Knives, which comes at the end of the last episode, and that's saying a lot.  Vash and Knives engage in a classic gunfight that'll be talked about for weeks, at least.  And that's just part of the series' appeal; awesome action that just adds to a terrific and deep story with memorable characters, all in an original futuristic Wild West-type setting.  This is anime at its near-best.  The only gripe I've had with the whole thing is that the animation could've been a little bit better; but it was a TV series, so it's to be expected.  You're not going to watch Volumes 1-7 and not bother with the ending, are you?  Quit waiting; the ""buy it"" button's right over your head.  Complete the set; you'll be glad you did.",994636800,,2129,4.634666666666667
1078440,4,6305812950,"Trigun is the best anime series I've seen since Neon Genesis, even better in some respects... except the ending.
Although as I said it was a ""good"" ending, it doesn't come close to Evangellion's (the movie ending that comes out in the states in late October 2001, but that I've already seen thanks to a low quality dubbed VHS tape I managed to track down after hearing that it existed).  If you want to see a great ending, wait for Neon Genesis on October 31, 2001 (or so that is what Manga says...).",992304000,,500,4.376344086021505
1078441,5,6305812950,"For a series that started out rather clownishly, the writers really drop the hammer for the last two discs.  You learn a lot of back story for characters in fast doses.  Vash is pushed to the limit, and at times looks like he's going to fold under the pressure.  His attempts to distance himself from Wolfwood and the girls fail (due mostly to their obstinence.)In the end, however, they seem like the very things that anchor him during the worst of his struggles.
I like the way this story has been drawn together over the 8 volumes.  The writers have taken a lot of time to slowly build the characters and set the scenes.  They place clues throughout (which means watch the whole thing through again...you'll be amazed at what hints are dropped early on.)  As a whole, the animation is stellar, the story is classic, and the music kicks. Trigun is superbly done.
The ending is bittersweet, but hopeful. I rate this up there with Cowboy Bebop as the best stuff I've seen.",991353600,7,972,4.557471264367816
1078442,5,6305812950,"This gets away from the comical Vash the stampeed that you either hate or love I personally love it! This like the other previous later trigun volumes 5,6,7 will focus more on story and get farther away from comedy.... But no problem cause this it one of the best series out there! If you saw the negative reveiws on the first volume of the series ignore them it is really funny! I also would recomend cowboy bebop to anyone who loves Trigun.... Iv'e heard people call it a rip off but it is a lot different and its really cool too.(but nuff said about that) This volume vash is gonna ""whop"" up some bad guys....well the bad guy knives...(actually thats what i predict will happen as of writting this reveiw it isn't out yet :^(  ~)snif snif Buy or watch this whole series it is worth it.....",990835200,4,792,4.387755102040816
1078443,5,6305812950,"Anime has always been a source of enteratinment for me. Almost a year ago, all I looked for was a quick fix of violence and little story. And that was what I was anticipating when I picked up the first volume of Trigun August last year. But I got a lot more than I expected.
Trigun takes place on the planet Gunsmoke. The plot revolves around Vash the Stampede, an outlaw whose head is worth $$60,000,000,000. The Humanoid Typhoon. He passes through towns only to leave them in ruins. A man so feared that when people see him, they run...Take two insurance women, Meryl and Milly. Their mission is to track down this man to stop him from causing anymore trouble...
Trigun is an anime that mainly relies on character development. As the series goes on, more and more of the character's pasts becomes revealed till you finally see the whole picture. That's what makes it so hard to wait to see the next volume. You just can't wait to get another piece of the puzzle.
In the eighth and final installment of my favorite anime, Vash will finally confront the demon of his past, Knives. He must finally settle the score he vowed to settle years ago. But can can Vash actually put away his pacifistic nature and finish Knives off? Well find out yourself by getting the final chapter to this epic anime!",990403200,7,1295,4.514893617021277
1078444,4,6305812950,"We'll, when i first saw the first trigun (vol. 1), i was thinking, why did i buy this, this is ...! But when I bought more triguns, just because i had more money than i needed, i started to get wound up in the story and could not stop watching it. Of course i don't wan to spoil it for you anime lovers, so I won't tell you what happens. Anyway, this is a great set so if you can get all of the Triguns!",988416000,,403,3.7529411764705882
1078445,5,6305812950,"High Noon, the last volume in the Trigun series ties up all loose ends in this series.  My fascination with this series continued to grow with each DVD release, and High Noon doesn't disappoint.
As is typical with most Anime series, you have to watch Trigun from the beginning.  It is a continuing storyline with a deep back story that only comes to light over the progression of the series.
In vol 8 we come face to face with Vash's true Nemisis.  We've seen Vash struggle with his feelings over this inevitable and final confrontation.  Vash's friends, Milly, Meryl and Wolfwood all must face great hardships as Vash faces his.
The Trigun series provides something different than the standard anime.  Sure, its got out of this world technology, but that isn't the focus at all.  Its strong back story and character interactions are what set it apart from standard anime.  There are even moments of comedy to help space all the drama and keep it from choking the viewer.  Overall, this is an excellent anime that should be part of any true Otaku's private collection.",988416000,11,1068,4.735135135135135

7895350,5,6305812950,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors.",1360022400,,554,4.276190476190476
7895351,5,6305812950,This is a fantastic end to a hilarious series. Vash finally confronts Nails and their epic fight begins and ends in this DVD.,1204934400,,125,4.478260869565218
7895352,5,6305812950,"First I would like to say this is an incredibly good anime. And no matter what you think of the description you should at least try watching a few episodes. Also in the description of these episodes it was stated that you never find out what vash is- this is untrue, it reveals what he is(I don't want to spoil anything for you if you have not seen the series). Also there is not a good chance there will be any more episodes. The person who said that there are still manga being made in Japan was correct, but these manga have a entirely different storyline than the anime(the manga are more like an alternate path than a continuation) and do not take place after the anime.

Also, I think the comics are better. I recommend reading them if you liked the show.",1151712000,,761,4.321678321678322
7895353,5,6305812950,"An anime-fanatic friend kept telling me I had to watch some show called Trigun, and I kept putting him off because his description sounded lame.  I mean really, a futuristic western on another planet?

Well . . . I watched the first episode and was hooked!  What an awesome show!  The ending is fitting and left me satisfied.  If you have only seen the show on Adult-Swim, I highly recommend buying all the DVDs, or at least the last, since the real ending is played out in the credits and is not entirely shown on Adult-Swim.

Now I find myself stuck in the same position as my friend.  I cannot explain this show adequately to anyone without making it sound lame!  I just make them watch it and get them hooked that way!",1111708800,2,722,4.37593984962406
7895354,5,6305812950,This is by far the greatest anime series ever. And there is a 99.9% chance that there will be new episodes within the next few years since new Trigun mangas (comics). are being released in Japan!,1070409600,,195,4.444444444444445

When Vash comes head to head with his twin, Knives.... And when something terrible happens in the episode Sin.. I just had to watch this DVD over and over again.. To anyone who likes action, drama and likes it when the character has a terrible past.. You'll love this series.... I highly recommend that you buy it...",1061596800,,446,4.309523809523809
7895356,5,6305812950,"THIS IS THE COOLEST! After watching the whole series, this just mademe start rolling around the floor all day saying oh my god. Why? Because to someone who watches anime a whole lot and gets thier life twisted by it knows that it just has a certain feeling of 'wow, is that really what it's all about?' And OH MY GOD!, of course ^^",1015372800,,331,4.1875
7895357,5,6305812950,"I was railroaded into watching the first Trigun by an old friend, but was instantly hooked.  I enjoyed the way that the show went from just silly to very deep. This was the climax. Every episode is emotionally charged, and the ending is really unexpected.  It is also left open.  I sorta wish that I clouda seen more of knives - i liked him better than Lagato anyways.",1003795200,,368,4.382352941176471
7895358,5,6305812950,"What can I say.  Trigun is simply a fun anime to watch which is almost a rarity these days.  Many anime series get very complicated or just too long. I mean Trigun is a very standard length (26 episodes) and very high quality animated series.  While at some points the animation is rediculous and somewhat goofy, it still keeps a good flow.  The characters are very interesting and have very good personalities and this last DVD is what shows you the end.  In this Anime you see The Gung Ho Guns, Legato, Wolfwood, Milly, Merril, Knives, and Vash all go out with a BANG. (No I don't mean they all get killed)
 Basically the 1st episode on this dvd gives you the story of wolfwood which everybody who has patiently bought the series dvd by dvd every few months has been waiting to hear ever since he was first introduced in the third dvd.  The second on the dvd wraps up the gung ho gun ordeal that vash constantly goes through.  The third episode on the dvd doesn't really have much.  In fact it really just shows merril and milly moving for the last time (They are shown in the last episode but really only in the credits and its just a still picture) And the fated last episode gives the entire story of  Vash's life from the time he and Knives landed on the desert planet through December, and August, and up to the final duel between Vash and Knives.  Definately a great Ending to a Great Anime.  This final chapter of Trigun contains very little of the comedy of trigun, but contains the best emotion and best action scenes.  If you haven't clicked add to cart by now, then you are only increasing the waiting time to when it arrives at your front door.  This dvd will shine greater than any other in your collection whether Cowboy bebop, any form of Gundam, Evangelion, Dragonball Z, or any other anime you could name!",998092800,5,1824,4.422155688622754
