8703218,2,B00TVJRGYO,"Most of the Sang H. Kim, Turtle Press Produced videos are excellent, however this is not one of them.  The impression in watching this video is the attempt by a Korean Tang Soo Do Master to take Okinawan Kobudo, i.e. Tonfa weapon and Koreanize it.  Unfortunately the attempt is a poor one and the demonstration of the techniques is poor.  For a Korean martial artist, ex. a Tae Kwon Do practitioner wanting to expand their weapons repertoire.  it is recommended that if they are interested in Okinawan weapons they go directly to the source. i.e. Okinawan Kobudo masters.  Without viewing the Nunchaku DVD's by the same author I expect that the approach is the same.",1454976000,,666,4.756521739130434
