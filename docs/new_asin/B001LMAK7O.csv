3686257,5,B001LMAK7O,"Five, filmed in 1951, is the original movie where only a few people are left alive on earth after nations kill poison one another with nuclear isotopes. This is a pretty good transfer to DVD. Actually, it's the best copy of the film I've viewed. FIVE is not an exciting movie, but it is a good story. Like the original B&W film ""On the Beach"" with Gregory Peck.
It covers some racial issues too. If you're into these type of films, you'll like ""The World, the Flesh, and the Devil"" with Harry Belafonte. Again, some racial issue here. Going more sci-fi, check out ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Vincent Price), and ""The Omega Man"" (Charlton Heston"". The house used in the movie is a famous hilltop building by Frank Lyoyd Wright.",1236816000,7,723,4.526717557251908
3686258,4,B001LMAK7O,"FIVE belongs to that rare class of science fiction film that lingers in the memory even decades after a first viewing.  Director/producer/writer Arch Oboler tried for something daring in an era that was dominated by threat of nuclear war.  He combined stark black and white images with literally no special effects with five survivors of an atomic armeggedon who faced both the harshness of survival and personal crisis to produce a film that some reviewers have termed simplistic and pretentious.  Such negative reactions are, I think, more of a reflection of the desire of most audiences to have slang bang action sequences with Rambo punching out hordes of Commie troops. Here Oboler went with a more low key, more believable approach.  When the nuclear dust settles over the world, the lucky few survivors will indeed be fortunate to find each other, and when they do, Oboler suggests that the prejudices and hates of the Old World will not go away.

William Phipps is Michael, who survives only because he happens to be in an elevator in the Empire State building.  He meets Roseanna (Susan Douglas), who similarly survives because she was rolled into a lead-lined X-Ray machine.  Against all odds, they meet in a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, where they must overcome the emotional baggage that each brings.  He with loneliness, she with pregnancy and a desire to find her husband.  Michael tries foolishly to kiss her and she repulses him.  They work around this and slowly grow attached to each other.  And all the while they talk.  This talk is the ordinary stuff of life, ordinary only in the extraordinary circumstances of their new life.  Far from viewing this torrent of words as pretentious, I saw it as a sincere desire to hold on to the fast evaporating vestiges of the post-war mindset.  Soon they meet three other survivors, all of whom believe in the power of words to alter reality.  At first these three talk of food.  Then they shift to other topics, some of which are ignoble (blunt racism) while others are a disjointed attempt to hold onto the past life even against all logic.  The camera work is grim and grainy, and in a film like this, it adds a powerful note of realism.  FIVE begins with two, expands into five, then shrinks back to two.  The ending is one that Rod Serling may have had in mind a decade later when he presented a TWILIGHT ZONE episode with Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery in a similarly themed post war Adam and Eve allegory.

FIVE is a brute demolition of the hope that in an emergency people will overcome their cultural and moral divides to reach a living compromise.  In Arch Oboler's hands, the reality is unsettlingly different.",1236038400,6,2699,4.773706896551724
3686259,4,B001LMAK7O,"This DVD transfer looks worlds better than previous VHS versions, but is still marred by problems that go back to the condition of the master print. But it's an excellent reminder that Arch Oboler was ahead of the pack in so many respects. Here he is, creating the first film about the survivors of a world-devastating nuclear exchange, establishing the language and tone--and setting the bar--for many films that followed. For all its apparent simplicity, FIVE contains complex characterizations and uncompromising moments of confrontation and narrative development, as well as some unforgettable images.",1235952000,14,605,5.516129032258065
3686260,4,B001LMAK7O,"The official review about this film is correct it is the first post nuke film that i know of.  I do not have this copy of the movie but I do have a bad copy made from an old film.

The movie is exactly how I remember it from the first time I say it on TV over 30 years ago maybe close to 40 years.  It is about a group of 5 people who gather in Arch Oboler's house (yes it was filmed in his Frank Loyld Wright house).

This movie will disappoint all of the five year old's out there because it is a slow moving introspective picture about the 5 who try and to some degree fail to live together in this house.  The movie was made at a time when action was not the only prerequisite for a movie.  There are no explosions and no real scenes of mass destruction and of course it is in black and white, so there is another reason for the 5 year old's to not like it.  There are 4 men and one pregnant woman at the beginning and at the end it is more of and Adam and Eve beginning.",1233792000,18,975,3.8208955223880596
3686261,5,B001LMAK7O,"Have not seen this movie yet but I love disaster movies of all kinds and am highly looking forward to this one. However, the editorial review above is incorrect, there are at least two post-apocalypse movies I can think off right off the top of my head. One was ""THE DAY AFTER"", an all-star cast 1983 made-for-tv movie directed by Nicholas Meyer, and ""ON THE BEACH"", a 1959 all-star movie that was remade in 2000 with Armand Assante.

While you're waiting for FIVE to come out, check these three movies out in the meantime. :)",1232409600,,526,4.536842105263158
3686282,4,B001LMAK7O,"Interesting movie on several elements.
This must be the ancestor of the many, many post-apocalyptic movies.
Without the special effects & heavy-handed gore of today's efforts in that genre, this focuses entirely on the characters and the situation they are trapped in.
If you like the Sirius XM retro-radio shows, including the Arch Oboler series ""Lights Out"", this will be one you want to watch.
Like the radio series of the 30's-early-60's it's a theatre of the mind.
You see the world through the eyes of these survivors, and it's really quite dramatic without being heavy-handed.
I would give a fifth star except for a few plot twists I found unsatisfying (but not annoyingly so).
Highly recommended.",1459209600,2,704,5.0256410256410255

3686313,4,B001LMAK7O,"As a classic sci-fi buff who has seen pretty much all of the movies made during that era, I was pleased to find one I hadn't seen, and such a good one.  As the opening credits appeared, I was surprised to see this was an Arch Oboler project.  He was known mainly for his radio dramas.  As with radio, he injected a hearty dose of social commentary into this movie, but it doesn't come across as preachy.

The vehicle used by Five was repeated frequently in movies of that time period.  A small group of people from various walks of life find themselves thrust together, isolated from contact with anyone else, and in that circumstance, forced to try and deal with their situation, and each other.  Only in this case, there's the added stress of knowing there may not be anyone else alive, and the isolation may be permanent.  The dreadfulness of their situation gives the movie a very somber tone.

The other reviewers have already explained a lot about what happens in the movie.  I'll just say I agree with those who think this movie is underrated.  It's obviously shot on a budget, but even so, the movie is artfully done, emotionally charged, and thought provoking.  Definitely worth a watch, for science fiction fan who prefers interesting dialogue to laser guns.",1423958400,,1268,4.666666666666667

3686318,5,B001LMAK7O,I always base a film on the characters and what happens to them.  If I am not interested in their plight then the film fails for me.  5ive managed to pull me in with a landscape of ruin and vanished dreams. The survivors each had a tale to tell of how they avoided the fate of death by some small miracle.  I enjoyed this early version of post apocalyptic life on Earth in the wake of nuclear holocaust.

I remember how sad I was when the woman's baby died but also a feeling of relief that I didn't have an infant sister who could die. Then baby Lisa died in 1955, followed by Mother in 1958.

It is a dark, noirish look at the end of the world, with only 5 survivors.  Some of them don't get along.  Filmed in Malibu, in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, by radio producer Arch Obler.  Leonard Maltin likes it but criticizes it for ""purple prose"", which is something I like about it.  The camera work was done by film students and is immaculate.  Very cheaply made, in b&w, but beautiful to look at.  A very small, minor film, but worth watching!",1360540800,,575,4.163636363636364

The title of the movie caught my attention and and we decided to watch it. The actors were unknown to us but so what. The plot of the movie scared the daylights out of us because who is to say that this can't happen in our lifetime. I am so happy that i have access to Amazon because i was able to search for this classic gem. Once found i immediately purchased it and let me tell you that the quality of this dvd is excellent.

Being but a small boy, I used to watch with fascination and fear watching how the big bad Russians would sneak attack us. This movie is one in a plethora of this genre.

3686359,5,B001LMAK7O,"A low budget marvel that is worth sticking through for some truly terrifying, brave scenes. More radio play than movie, it IS talky - really, what are you GONNA do after the end of the world BUT talk? Unless you're battling mutants or some other cliche, talk is what the survivors would do, so - DUH! It's worth noting that this film is probably the first to deal with an apocalypse that is not a flight of fancy; it is only since the creation of the Atom bomb that the end of the world seems TRULY possible, even likely, and it's profound impact on the American psyche is showcased here... Shameful that this striking, original film is being treated like Plan 9 From Outer Space, marketed as So Bad It's Good If You're Drunk. So a film landmark is kicked to the curb while truly awful films are hailed as cinematic triumphs and given deluxe 3 disc special editions. Five accomplishes more, with almost no budget budget, than Michael Bay has with all his billions.",1263168000,4,964,4.514285714285714
3686360,5,B001LMAK7O,"The subject of this film may seem commonplace - the world destroyed by nuclear holocaust, one woman and several men the only survivors, - but it was the first to tackle this subject matter, and it does it very well. This one does have one interesting catch - the woman survivor is pregnant.

I'm usually on top of new classic releases, but this one escaped my attention until DVD Savant named it the top disc of 2009. I hadn't seen it since the third grade - Thanskgiving 1966 -  and it made quite an impression on me at the time, so I thought I'd purchase it and see if it lived up to my memories. It did and then some. I can't really share any details of the story without giving anything away, except perhaps the character of the survivors. The woman is understandably obsessed with returning to the city and finding out for sure if her husband is dead or alive. Of the four men one is disqualified as a suitor because of his age, and another is disqualified because, after all, this is 1951 and he is African American and the woman is white. Of the two actually eligible suitors by 1951 standards, one is a brutish slob and the other is thoughtful and forward thinking, setting up a Cain and Abel dynamic between the two.

The film audio and video quality are excellent. From 2000 - 2005 Sony put out some of the more technically challenged classic film discs I've seen, but in the last three or four years they've really turned things around. Highly recommended for fans of 1950's sci-fi.",1262390400,4,1493,4.4416058394160585

I also remember when they went to commercial they would replay the beginning when you saw the high winds after the bomb explodes and that scared me.

Eventually, Rosanne makes it to her aunts isolated hilltop house and faints when she finds a man living there.  Two more survivors show up, then they find a fellow on the beach and take the wretch home.  This fellow (James Anderson as Eric) is seditious and dangerous, quickly proving himself to be racist and a petty thief.  How are the survivors to survive when one of the worst aspects of society is in their midst?

Unrelenting in its depiction of the aftermath of war.  The plot fairly trudges along at a leisurely pace.  It is a complete downer, things do not end

8318627,5,B001LMAK7O,"Here's a still-powerful film about the end of the world that has all the more emotional impact for being so understated. Apparently the very first film to deal with the possibility of nuclear war & its aftermath, it almost has the look & feel of a European arthouse film -- clear, vibrant B&W cinematography; innovative filming angles; restrained performances from its little-known actors; philosophical overtones. Yet I never once found it dull or dragging in the least. It gripped my attention, it made me feel & it made me think.

At this point, let me warn the potential viewer to utterly ignore the snark-laden ""review"" from the Amazon reviewer, which to me reveals more about the lack in the reviewer, rather than any lack in the film. The story very quietly but effectively points up the folly of grasping after power, wealth, status; and it also makes clear that the futile attempt to possess all those things, especially at the expense of others, can destroy an individual's world as well as the entire world. It asks us to consider what really matters in life, as with Mr. Barnstaple, whose final words are of all the things he always wanted to do, but never got around to doing. And the ludicrous sight of the shallow, self-centered Erik, gloating over his treasure trove of jewelry in a world where it has absolutely no value ... and perhaps never really did.

As for the dialogue being ""purple"" or ""pretentious"" as some have claimed, I heard very little of that myself. And in any case, even if a line or two does get a little self-consciously poetic or portentous -- if being one of a handful of survivors after the end of the world isn't reason enough for that, then what is? Personally, I think a certain amount of reflective, solemn dialogue is quite believable in these circumstances.

Obviously a labor of love for producer/director/writer Arch Oboler, it benefits from its minimalist approach. Even the shocks are muted, reflecting the emotional numbness of the survivors. The ruins that he's really exploring are psychological, and quite clearly existed even before the bombs fell. His choices are small, unexpected, and ultimately deeply moving: the little details of everyday life that were never noticed until they weren't there (and which we seldom notice in our own busy, rushed, everyday lives). This is a film that deserves to be better known, and I'll definitely be watching it again in the near future -- most highly recommended!",1489881600,,2459,4.87799043062201

8318630,5,B001LMAK7O,"A profoundly disturbing film on many levels- as it deals with the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust-including gory realistic pictures of rotting corpses following a  nuclear war.  It brings out the aspects of 5 different people facing death-yet having survived a global cataclysm and trying somehow to ""go on living"". Their interactions show a myriad of coping strategies-some ambuguious, some profoundly evil, some showing remarkable altruism. yet all come across as possible human responses to the likely ""end of the world- and human life as well"".  In one sense it shows that ""without law, without money, without bills, without family, without norms or laws"" these surviviors are ""condemned to be free"" as Jean paul Sartre said. ""Now what? "" indeed.
  This firm is almost exactly 90 minutes- and the best movies are always about that length-like a good stage production-nothing is wasted- the plot moves along and fits together in a coherest way. This dvd in black and white has first rate cinematography along with a structure designed by Frank Lloyd Wright that is a joy to see in and of itself.
  This film along with ""Panic in Year Zero"" with ray Milland (1962) also made during the height of the Cold  War when nuclear anhilliation was a possibility that was in ""the back of many people's minds"" would be a good duo to watch for thoughtful and discerning folks interested in issues of war and peace, human rights, and how people would act and life would play out for the survivors after a worldwide catastrophe.  While I cannot think of a more downbeat subject matter, there is still shown that there is a part of the human spirit that can and does assert itself in the face of this most bleak of circumstances.
