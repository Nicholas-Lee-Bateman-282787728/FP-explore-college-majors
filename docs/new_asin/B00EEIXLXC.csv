5910570,4,B00EEIXLXC,All in all it was great show that made me laugh and cry. The one dislike I had was that the bedroom scenes were cut out. To me those scenes were important especially when it came to her friend. After speaking with someone about it I came to understand that it is due to where the item is from which explains why it came with the scenes edited out.,1399852800,2,347,4.043478260869565
5910571,5,B00EEIXLXC,"I watched this on Drama Fever and I had to buy the complete set as a gift to myself. The main character is so funny, I loved her. I actually love all the characters but she is my favorite. I thought it was a cute, light-hearted series And I was so excited to get it.",1389312000,4,266,3.8545454545454545
5910572,5,B00EEIXLXC,the minute I saw the start of this show I a had to buy it!!! love the character and the story for once the Cinderella is a older woman not young!!!,1387411200,2,147,3.774193548387097
5910573,5,B00EEIXLXC,"A middle-aged hair stylist ends up in an unexpected love triangle with a long-time coworker and a ""half her age"" cyclist hottie. Who will she end up with?

Well, this was fun. Shinohara Ryoko is excellent as the ""old mannish""--for a hairstylist, her hair is often just slapped on top of her head and she doesn't much care about her fashion image--and spinsterish ""Cinderella. Tachibana, the salon manager, is always arguing and tossing verbal barbs at and receiving them from Sakura (Shinohara). One of the salon's customers, an affluent and lovely young woman with issues,  is in love with Tachibana (salon manager). She perceives the ""vibes"" between the clueless Sakura and Tachibana (talk about self-alienation), and adds the very handsome and athletic Hiroto into the mix: She manipulates the guilt-stricken cyclist into seducing Sakura. It works. And then, things get complicated, not just for Sakura, Hiroto, and Tachibana (the love triangle of the clueless and manipulated), but for Sakura's friends (2 galpals) and Tachibana's friensd (two guypals).

There is a lot going on in this drama, and it's a lot of fun (and sometimes painful) to watch the relationships tangle and work out. Haruma Miura is super adorable, and the other male lead whose name escapes me (another handsome J-actor who played the scheming brother in PRICELESS recently) does a very good job. The female actresses do an excellent job. Yamamoto Yusuke does a sexy guest role, too, for those who are his fans.

If you like older female/younger male romances, and some humor, give this a shot.",1384473600,5,1570,5.073643410852713
5910574,5,B00EEIXLXC,"A beautiful tell of finding love at any age, healing and redemption. Hiroto (Huruma Mirua) and Sakura (lead female actress) are brillantly charming and are stunningly real actors in this modern day Cinderella. There is no dual moment in this drama, the entire cast do a great job of acting out everyday life...it was so good, it felt like I was watching my own life. They comedic breaks are a wonderful touch....overall a very charming and fun movie. You won't regret buying it. (Beware, the copy I purchased, on CD #2, the romances scene has been but, a disappointment and the scene with Yusuke Yamamoto was also cut). Still don't regret buying.",1379116800,5,646,4.776785714285714
