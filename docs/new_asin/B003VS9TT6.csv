8407068,4,B003VS9TT6,"Having seen this film (and watched it intelligently, as a historical document of the fears of a particular period), I cannot disagree more strongly with the other review offered here. Yes, it is a very early made-for-television movie, and so doesn't have the kind of budget and production values of modern offerings. But in 1950 -- just five years after the US attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (6 & 9 August 1945, respectively) -- Atomic Attack functions partially as informative (rememeber that the H-Bomb wasn't developed until 1951, so this movie is about an A-Bomb, specifically a fission bomb (the USSR tested its first such bomb in mid-1949), partially as a reaction to the beginning of the nuclear arms race between the USA and USSR, and also -- arguably -- as a cultural example of a kind of ""karmic"" fear that, having dropped the bomb on Japan twice, the US had made itself vulnerable to suffering a similar attack.

This isn't a film about what it was like to live in the 1950s; for a start, this film is from only a few months into that decade, and for another thing, most of this film deals with a hypothetical extreme emergency situation. Taken for what it is, however -- an early tv movie (at a point when owning a television was still something of a rarity; only around 5 percent of US households owned a television in 1950) which imagines the impact of the aftermath of an A-Bomb attack. By and large, *Atomic Attack* is actually pretty accurate given the technology of the day, and it serves as an early example of what would eventually emerge as a cycle of such films by the 1980s and very early 1990s (so the final decade of the Cold War) in films such as *The Day After* (1983) and *By Dawn's Early Light* (1990). This is a film worth watching on its own merits (especially if you understand the context), but is particularly interesting when understood as an expression of the very real fears of a particular period of American (and world) history.",1386115200,,1970,4.628571428571429
8407069,1,B003VS9TT6,This is without question the worse D.V.D.that i have ever seen. The film is behond poor and the sound is worse. The acting is just plain bad. I should have known this when i saw it was made in 1950. They have the nerve to charge 10.00 dollars for this. I thought my Grandson would learn something about living in the 50's when the threat was real. Please don't spend your hard earned money on this.,1294531200,2,398,4.25
