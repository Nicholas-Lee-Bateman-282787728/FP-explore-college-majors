4396941,4,B004KISO60,"Its something that isn't your everyday movie grind. Shades of grey and blue is what the screen stays in. Its a strange form of movie. the effects , the storytelling is not linear. A story about a teacher and her confession to the class and then the following confessions thereon. The movie has segments shown with a black screen stating the name of the person who makes the successive confessions. Its a crazy, twisted revenge movie. The storytelling is very peculiar for how the characters move throughout the movie.

Watch this movie to have a different and strange experience. Its got many concepts attached without one outshining the other which makes it difficult for me to define various facts about the movie.

I have got up intrigued with the disturbance a movie can cause, specifically the end.",1320537600,,803,4.854014598540146
4396942,5,B004KISO60,"CONFESSIONS is one of the most savage, brutal and poignant revenge stories I have ever seen. It doesn't start off all that great, but it by the end I was in awe. The movie begins in a Japanese classroom on the final day of classes before the spring break and the remainder of the movie are the events that follow the fateful day in this classroom.

The point of view switches numerous times throughout to different people affected by the event in the beginning. As the movie progresses you revisit past scenes from different character's perspectives but the scenes are never monotonous because you know much more the second time around. Much like an onion, CONFESSIONS is multi-faceted and there is much to discover and re-discover as each subsequent layer is peeled back.

A beautiful thing about this movie, at least for me, is how wildly my sympathy flip-flopped. Don't take sides too adamantly because as you learn more and more about the characters and events of the movie your sympathy too is bound to jump ship to the point where you're not totally sure who to side with. CONFESSIONS challenges you in this way. Some may find it frustrating but it just added to CONFESSIONS's charm and wit.

Unrelentingly dark, this movie is bound to incite feelings of bleakness and perhaps is not suited to those with a weak heart. The subject matter is heavy, the characters are morally-reprehensible and the feel of the movie is wholly somber - from the greys and dull blues which saturate each and every scene to the melancholy (albeit perfectly-suited) soundtrack which works its way infectiously into your mind and makes the horrific scenes before your eyes resonate deeply.

I will not spiel on for much longer, but in closing; the acting is top-notch; the storytelling is captivating; the cinematography is gorgeous; and the touches of violence and blood are done in taste and to immense effect - never feeling gratuitous.

I have seen many Japanese films but this one takes the cake as one of the best I have ever seen. If what I've said so far sounds convincing enough definitely give this movie a shot because I am rather hard to please and it did not let me down an ounce.

4396946,5,B004KISO60,"I watched this film in two parts:

The first half an hour was so challenging that I was put off completely and thought this film was not for me. ""Confessions"" starts with Ms. Moriguchi introducing you to the actions that preceded the beginning of the film so that you can understand the reason of her actions. However, she speaks as fast as a news presenter, which means that you need to read subtitles, that come and go very quickly, which, along with the repetitive soundtrack and the fast editing, makes the first half an hour a stressing experience. This is when I stopped the film and gave up on it.

A couple of days after, I decided to give it a second chance and I was glad I did. After that initial half an hour, ""Confessions"" proved to be excellent, and turned from a news broadcast into a film. The movie is about three characters mainly: the school teacher, Ms. Moriguchi, and her two students, Naoki and Shuya, who confess why their life led them to become who they are and to act why they did. We are presented to these three intertwined stories in a film that it's visually beautiful to the point of seeming more like a music video than a film per se.

If you're looking for a movie with characters who redeem themselves, learn a lesson from their actions and are reborn into new spiritual beings, watch a different film. ""Confessions"" is about ""revenge"", and while the audience will learn that revenge leads you nowhere, the three main characters act very cold blooded and not looking for any kind of redemption. They all have an agenda and they will be satisfied when their pain is over. For me, this is what makes this film stand out among most films about this topic. All in all, a great film, which I am glad that I decided to give it a second chance.",1367020800,6,1771,4.443076923076923

4396949,5,B004KISO60,"CONFESSIONS is not perfect but it's pretty close. It's dark and gorgeous. It's unsettling. It's got Takako Matsu and Yoshino Kimura; Radiohead and Boris are on the soundtrack. It gets crazy and goes by quickly at times (it's hard to catch all the subtitles) even though a good portion of the film is in slow motion. It's a testament to the skill of the director that everything makes an impression, even things that go fluttering by. A few times, for a moment, it seems like the film might lose steam, and then whoosh! There it goes again. This is hands-on film making. An audio-visual package right up there with Myung-se Lee's ""M"". It gets physical. Nakashima understands how to manipulate sight, sound, and time moving through time, which creates both a sense of being on a rollar coaster and being in suspended animation; like being in a dream, or a car wreck.

It's creepy that most of the players in the film are 14 years old, talking about killing people and their mommy problems. The film gets most of its fuel from mommy problems. Shocking that it seems so believable that these kids understand what they are talking about. Tetsuya Nakashima makes these kids smart. It's very refreshing.

The first and last acts are both tours de force. I've seen three different English translations of the last line in the film. Don't google it until after you've seen it. What an ending! Some folks have written that Nakashima throws it all away with the last line but I think it depends on how you take it. I found it eerily ambiguous and evil.

Most commenters on the film will point out the film's ""social commentary"", i.e., that kids under fourteen years of age can't be punished by the law for anything. I'm not big on social commentary commentating, but watching the film I couldn't help but think that any thirteen year old contemplating murder gets a green lit idea.

If you over think this film it can fall apart. If you're the type that does that kind of thing you won't like it as much as I did. But unless you are also sensitive to slow motion or post rock emo soundtracks it's hard not to be overwhelmed by this masterfully crafted film.",1337644800,8,2146,4.595300261096606

4396952,5,B004KISO60,"First off, the translation to the Japanese title of this movie should be ""EXPLANTATIONS"" or ""REVELATIONS"" instead of ""CONFESSIONS"". WHY? Confession has the connotation that one is sorry or remorseful for his/her own action(s), and thus needs to atone for the sin(s).

This is a very well-done movie, a brilliant synthesis of the story-telling of many great directors of the past, east and west: Hitchcock's Rope, Kurosawa's Rashmon...and carries a very universal theme: there are people who do pure terrible and evil things to others without any moral or physical restraint, every one of them should be indicted and punished accordingly!

8432975,2,B004KISO60,"Im somewhat bemused to see Nakashima Tetsuyas 2010 Japanese junior high school drama Confessions (Kokuhaku) so highly rated both here and elsewhere. It is part of a trend of films centered on violence in Japanese schools which can be traced back to Kinji Fukasakus notorious 2000 Battle Royale (ripped off by Quentin Tarantino for the character of Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill) and remains consistent with the stylistic overkill inherent in this type of film. Wall-to-wall rock music (Radiohead mixed with two Japanese bands, The Xx and Boris) overlays flashily edited visuals resulting in what is in effect a 106 minute pop promo video. The film has clearly been constructed on a computer program (replete with completely unnecessary CGI effects) with acting performances being hacked apart by rapid editing to the extent that we cant really comment on how good they are. Zero characterization combined with this hip style makes the film as Mark Kermode says, virtually impenetrable on an emotional level.

All of which is a shame for underneath the technological overkill lie issues within Japanese society which are in dire need of proper address. The spat of films focusing on violent incidents in Japanese schools illustrates that in reality everything is pretty far from OK here. I have worked in Japanese schools for over 20 years and can verify that the extent of violence, bullying, restlessness and complete breakdown in discipline shown in this film does indeed exist. This may surprise many of you who think of Japanese kids as simply polite and obedient. Think again. Most obviously in the spotlight are extreme incidents like the girl who beheaded her friend because she made disparaging remarks about her appearance on a social media website, the kid who impaled his classmates head on the school gate, the boy who killed his mother, severed her head, put it in a plastic bag, put the bag beside him on the floor of a video arcade where he played games for a while before giving himself and the bag to the police. Underneath these extreme examples runs the everyday unruliness of many schools here. In the last year in my area a junior high school had to be closed early on several occasions because teachers couldn't control the kids. During tests students lay down in the corridor, throw burning toilet paper rolls out of windows and set off fireworks in their classrooms. When the city mayor visited the school he was pelted with tennis balls. Police regularly patrol the area by day while we hear the kids riding with bosozokku motorcycle gangs by night. Bullying is rife, teenage suicide is common and it has reached the stage where in order for kids to get any kind of education at all they have to go to expensive private cram schools to fill the holes left by the lack of teaching going on in their own schools. There exists the phenomenon here of ni-nen byou or second grade sickness that acknowledges that kids are at their most difficult when they are in the second grade of junior high school. Recently kids are starting to turn nasty even earlier than that with many elementary schools resembling zoos to a large extent. On the whole the government authorities play down the situation, largely ignoring it so that when extreme examples which cant be ignored do hit the headlines they are turned into media sensations which if anything inspire kids to be even more violent.

On the face of it Confessions does present many of these issues. Junior high school teacher Moriguchi Yuko (Matsu Takako) kicks off the film by announcing to her homeroom the news that her four year old daughter has been killed by two of their number and the film charts how she exacts her revenge knowing that the juvenile courts will not punish the culprits severely enough. The film is all plot and it would be wrong for me to reveal anything more than this basic premise. The events are organized under the heading of various confessions from the key students involved as well as Moriguchi. Unfortunately this is not upheld rigorously and various events keep imploding from varying conflicting perspectives to make for a veritable mess. In the densely edited mlange we can see the teacher has lost her classroom, the kids are busy playing with their cellphones, reading manga, picking on each other both verbally and physically. Porno and virtual video games along with violence-promoting websites make up the 2D world all the kids seem to live in. The blame is laid accurately if somewhat simplistically at the door of the parents  over-protective monster mothers and weak or entirely absent fathers. Here one boy is pampered to the point where he lacks all self-confidence and is easily used and abused by another classmate. Another boy is abandoned by his mother and his violence is explained by a mama-com (Oedipus complex). Another boy sees that the media take more notice of kids who rebel than kids who succeed academically and so plans accordingly. Another is inspired by a media case into preparing to poison her whole family. Other issues skated on are the appalling ignorance kids have of AIDS and how it spreads (to this day I know schools continue to tell kids that AIDS is brought into Japan by foreigners as if Japanese sex tours to Bangkok don't exist) and the complete lack of protection provided for teachers who are at the complete mercy of monster parents and their spoilt brat progeny.

All of this flies past us, but none is given a properly thorough treatment. Indeed where we should be presented with these themes in a framework where we care for the characters so that we are moved into deeper involvement, Nakashima turns the issues into mere entertainment with a superficial treatment which is high-octane razzmatazz and little more. It is claimed that the film is closely based on Minato Kanaes novel, but I seriously doubt if the novel is as shallow. Minato was a 30 something housewife turned first time novelist when she wrote it and I imagine she has much more sympathy for Moriguchi than we see in this film. Crucially we are never allowed to feel her grief or be drawn into her fantastical revenge. The big themes are all ticked off and duly noted, but for Nakashima nothing is more important it seems than the pseudo-dramatic CGI clouds looming ominously over the school or the ludicrous equally fake explosive finale. One day somebody (Kore-eda Hirokazu perhaps?) might make a film which tackles the frail state of the Japanese education system properly. Sadly Confessions isn't it. Even as a straightforward thriller it fails, the cardboard cut-out characterization making Brian (Carrie) De Palma of the 70s seem a subtle master of psychology in comparison.

Third Windows presentation of this film is exemplary. The visuals and the sound are both crisp and clear. There is a second disc of extras which as labelled might appear to be two separate films (Final Confessions by Tetsuya Nakashima and Real Confessions by students), but they are not. The first is a 70 minute making of documentary which is rather good. The second is simply a series of interviews with the child actors involved.",1472947200,,7130,4.884393063583815
