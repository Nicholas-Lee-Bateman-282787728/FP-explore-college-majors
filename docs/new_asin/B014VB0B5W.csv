8731923,3,B014VB0B5W,"Let me let you in in on a little something; you're a consumer, just as I am. I like you, so I figure I ought to be completely honest. I watched this show for the fanservice. That's it. And you know what? I got exactly what I wanted. But is this show any more than just a feast for the eyes? Let's take a looksie.

PLOT: For the most part, it's pretty straight-forward. A battle-royale with a bunch of beautiful, psychotic assassins, out to kill this one defenseless girl, except they can only attack one at a time. Now, this takes almost all of the fun an surprise out of things, except when a few nutcases break the rules. We follow Azuma as she tries to protect the target from her assailants, so it's pretty much your average ""enemy of the week"" show. There's something else about an ominous organization and voodoo magic, but it is so convoluted, rushed, and uninvested in itself that I won't try to explain it. It flows well enough, but ends up being rather predictable and shallow.

SOUNDTRACK: Fast-paced guitar and techno music. Nothing spectacular or noteworthy, but blends in well enough with the action scenes. The opening is catchy halfway through and the closing is meh, but you can check both of those out on youtube if your curiosity is piqued.

ANIMATION: Fluid and crisp, with unique and clean character designs. Where it really shines are the action scenes, and that's where they put the money, especially since the show revolves around the battles. The backgrounds convey a dark, foreboding atmosphere, which actually almost seems out of place considering the content and location, but it serves as a nice distraction, that you just might be watching an extraordinary show. You aren't, of course, but the girls are diabolically cute.

CHARACTERS: This is an antagonists' show; the only reason you keep watching is to witness the unique fighting style and characteristics of each new enemy. Unfortunately, the biggest wound in the character department are the two main characters, Azuma and Ichinose. They are bland pieces of cardboard that your eyes will chew up and spit out. The mysterious and perky Nio was my personal favorite, but the majority of these killers are a whole lot of fun and a heck of a lot of awesome. Each has their own particular style of fighting, even if some are ridiculous and impractical, but trust me when I say that they keep both the plot and the entertainment rolling. *NOTE: If you are searching for fanservice, but are averse to the caricature known as ""yandere,"" these characters may not appeal to you at all.

EMOTIONAL: Kinda funny, since I would not call it an emotional show, but it tries its darndest to be one. Each character has a backstory that tries to captivate you, but, sadly, they are not compelling nor long enough to add sufficient depth to the characters. Anyone could die, and I would not give two flips. And this whole ""secret organization"" that's thrown in to add gravity to the situation and make sense of the plot? It doesn't do either. This makes the narrative a filthy muddle, and heavily damages the final product.

Quite frankly, this show is not very well made. Someone had some fancy designs and a basic premise, but tried to cram too much emotion and story into the minimal number of episodes. It works as popcorn material; don't expect substance. Needless to say, as I said before, I looked into this show initially for the purpose of fanservice. And I received exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, fan service and eye-candy is not a worthy substitute for all of the above criterion. It wants desperately to be more than it is, but is drained dry of the necessary ingredients. And, even then, the fanservice is one-note, appealing only to yandere fans. There are elements that hint to yuri, as well, but nothing is confirmed in this regard. Therefore, I can recommend this anime to very few. I will most likely not be buying it, but I do not regret watching it, and I enjoyed it to the point where I at least had to award it three stars. I suggest that you stream first and see if it meets your specific tastes, though It might not, but at least your curiosity would be satiated and your wallet spared. There are better still battle royale storylines and femme fatale assassins elsewhere; take my word as you see fit.",1446595200,36,4308,4.676781002638522
