7743079,5,B01F48PJIA,"Most folks will know actor Jonathan Pryce, from his part in TVs Game of Thrones but the Welsh-born actor has been acting since 1972. This small independent film was made in 2015 just before his Game of Throne appearances and is a joy to watch. It played a number of film festivals (mostly Jewish Film Festivals and received high audience ratings.  It played in Philly (where I live) but I missed it and just got to see on DVD (from a screener sent by the distributor  Menemsha Films (a company with specializes in Jewish-related feature films).

If youve read my other reviews on Amazon, you will know that I hate spoilers and lengthy reviews that say too much and spoil the discovery for the viewer. Ill try not to give too much away here, but just the basics. It takes place  London, England , Canada where the old Jewish business community is declining. A baker (bagel, mostly) -played by Pryce  is trying to survive. Also trying to survive is a young black teenager who lives in the ghetto and runs drugs (marijuana) to provide himself and his mother with money. (All this is revealed in the first few minute). Then a accident happens and the teen and the baker find themselves in the weed bagel business. Not exactly legal, eh? Well, thats all Im going to tell you. There are happy and sad moments but you need to discover for yourself.  I reviewed an almost parallel story in a DVD titled Paulette back in March. I loved that and love this film too!

Because I received an advance screener  I do not know if there are any bonus features on the DVD for sale on Amazon.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7743083,4,B01F48PJIA,"""Dough"" (2015 release from the UK; 94 min.) brings the story of an elderly Jewish baker, Nat Dayan. As the movie opens, Dayan is awakened at 4 am by his alarm clock, and off he goes to his beloved ""Dayan & Son"" bakery for another long day. Much to his dismay, his baking assistant unexpectedly gives his notice, and Dayan puts up an ""Apprentice Wanted"" sign. In a parallel story, we get to know Ayyash, a teenage Muslin boy who recently emigrated to England with his mum from somewhere in Africa. Ayyash is in a bit of trouble due to selling marijuana on the side. His mum pushes Ayyash to apply for the vacant apprenticeship. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed by John Goldschmidt, a veteran of mostly British TV work. Here he tackles a light-hearted story about how fate (not faith) brings together an old Jew and a teenage Muslim, and how wonderful religious tolerance and mutual respect can be, all the while also suggesting that the occasional marijuana-spiked doughnut or muffin may not be such a bad thing either. There is nothing much surprising in the entire movie, but it's all done in a rather pleasant and inoffensive, if at time borderline preachy, way. Jonathan Pryce as the old Jewish Baker brings a fine performance. The boy playing Ayyash has an easy smile on his face, and the chemistry between these two lead characters is obvious. Interesting is that before the movie started, there was a 30 second ""introduction"" clip by Pauline Collins, who plays the owner of the shop space, to remind us how important religious tolerance is and to enjoy the movie. That was a little weird, I must say.

""Dough"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or buzz at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati a number of weeks ago. I wasn't really planning on seeing it, but since it's now been playing for so long, I wanted to see for myself why this movie must be doing so well that it's still running after all these weeks. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. The crowd absolutely loved the movie, laughing and chuckling at all the right moments. If they keep packing'em in like this, I imagine ""Dough"" will stay in the theater for a good while longer. If you are in the mood for a light-hearted foodie-comedy about a Jewish bakery with marijuana-spiked wares, I might suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1469404800,,2629,4.639484978540772

It's no a comedy, it's a what did we learn about ourselves drama with some comedic moments.

Basically an African refugee to the UK hasn't been able to land a job so is trying his hand at drug dealing which has literally left him without pants.  The local drug kingpin, offers him work for him, but insists he must get a proper cover job too.  Lukcily for him the baker his mother is a cleaner for has just lost his apprentice (would a small bakery shop really have the revenue to employ a cleaner?).  However no one told the old Jewish baker that his cleaner is a muslim and now he employs two of them.  However the bakery is barely getting by, it's customers have almost all moved away over the years or died.  Maybe he'll just see how employing this muslim kid goes.",1482278400,,1080,4.321782178217822

7743129,4,B01F48PJIA,"A despairing, kvetching old Jewish man and a teenage African Muslim pot dealer walk into a kosher bakery together.

No, its not the start of a tasteless joke, but the premise of Dough, a droll, cross-cultural British dramedy about lonely, displaced souls who grow to love one another.

Jonathan Pryce (Brazil, Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) disappears effortlessly into the role of Nat Dayan, a widowed Orthodox Jewish baker whose beloved shop is going under.

Nat is one of those guys who was born old and tired. You can almost feel the bones ache as he gets up at 4 a.m. to set up the days mix of kosher challah, croissants and cookies.

Founded in 1947 by his dad, Dayan & Son has seen better days, as has its East London neighborhood. His regular customers are moving out or dying of old age, and a nasty, villainous developer is sweeping in to buy the whole block. Worse, Nats slick lawyer of a son doesnt give a fig about bagels or fig rolls.

Director John Goldschmidt skillfully crosscuts Nats story with the daily adventures of Ayyash (Jerome Holder), an immigrant teenager who plays hooky all day with his stoner friends while his mom holds down two jobs.

The films careful, early characterization pays off when Ayyash ends up as Nats apprentice, an almost cataclysmic event that gives them both a heavy dose of culture shock.

Dough has a familiar story line: Enemies at first, the pair learn to appreciate each other until one of them commits a gross betrayal. (It involves hash brownies and marijuana-laced challah.) Eventually, a deeper connection  a true love, a father-son bond  is established.

Doughs formulaic structure is enlivened by the dynamic chemistry between its leads. Pryce and Holder play off each other with all the bluster and awkwardness of a real-life father and son.

They are ably backed by a host of oddball characters, including Nats lonely landlady, Joanna (Pauline Collins), his uptight rabbi (Daniel Ben Zenou), and the neighborhoods temperamental drug lord (Ian Hart), who seems a little too envious of Nats paternal bond with Ayyash.

Dough won't have you rolling in the aisle with laughter. Its humor is more subtle, ironic  and all the sweeter for it.",1474588800,,2201,4.868632707774799

7743162,5,B01F48PJIA,"The East End in London is where immigrants come when they seek refuge in England. It teems with foreign languages and exotic smells and fashions that are both ethnic and eclectic. Its a melting pot, sure, but its one that often boils over with people who don't want to sit down at the same table.

For generations Jews from all over Europe settled here and formed stable neighborhoods. Recently, came new immigrants, from Africa, from Muslim countries, who had no tradition of being friendly with Jews anywhere and certainly didn't like having to live next door to them.

Nate Dayan (Welsh veteran actor Jonathan Pryce), a recent widower, goes to work before dawn every morning in the bakery that his father founded nearly a century ago and named Dayan and Son. Lately old age is catching up with Nate  hes burning the bagels and dropping tray loads of croissants and even his loyal customers are complaining that the fairy cakes aren't as tasty as they used to be. He needs an apprentice.

Nate allows himself to be talked into hiring the son of his cleaning lady, a recent escapee from the terrible wars in Darfur in Africa. Teenage Ayyash (Jamaican-Barbadian newcomer Jerome Holder) wants the job, not for any love of pastry, but so he can hold a screen job while he makes more money working for the local drug dealer.

A devout Jew, Nate is shocked to discover Ayyash saying his morning prayers to Allah in the bakerys storage room. It didn't occur to Nate that Ayyash might be a Muslim. He just thought he was an African, whatever that means, and now he has a real-live Muslim working in his shop. Oy vey.

To his surprise, Ayyash begins to channel his Inner Baker. He carefully braids egg dough to make beautiful big loaves of challah. He dollops just the right amount of apricot jam into cream cheese mixtures to make terrific rugalach cookies. The mountain peaks on his macaroons are browned to perfection.

One day, feeling inspired, Ayyash empties an entire baggie of marijuana into the enormous metal dough blender. The resultant pastries, though definitely not kosher, are a big hit. Nates clueless elderly customers love the odd-tasting goodies that make them giggle for hours.  Soon also, theres a rush of new customers, millenials, who form a line  around the block  to buy brownies.

But its not all peachy. Neighbor and new widow Joanna (Pauline Collins, famous for Shirley Valentine) is so frisky Nate is afraid to be alone with her. One villainous money grubber promises to put Nate out of business, another threatens to send him to jail for the rest of his life when the marijuana-laced goodies are discovered. Lets not forget the drug dealer, or the cops, or Nates horrified lawyer son or Ayyashs poor worried mother. Can the old Jew wearing his yarmulke and the young Muslim in his prayer cap resolve ancient suspicions that separate them and find success together?

Of course they can--this is a movie! English-Austrian director John Goldschmidt and his two writers have put together a tale that, while utterly predictable, is also simply delicious. Despite a string of troubles that would make lesser heroes turn on one another, Doughs odd couple realizes they are in the same foxhole, no matter what name they give to God. The actors are so good and having such a fun time, they convince the audience of what theyve come to know--all good things come to men who bake together.",1472342400,,3401,4.784982935153583

7743177,5,B01F48PJIA,"I have been raving about the film  ever since seeing it in Florida . I loved it so much that I traced down  the distributor  and asked if I could use it as part of our  Senior Citizen's Unity in the Community Group 's month-long study of Islam as the message is so special. To make it happen,  personally paid the much higher fee as the message it conveys is priceless.  Then before it was shown - the DVD came out and so I purchased a copy from Amazon as many in the audience have hearing problems and appreciate the subtitles.  Tonight we had an audience of 200 people and as the last credit ran - people got up and applauded.  The next thing I knew -- they all wanted to know where I got the film as they want to get copies for their families, etc.

This is a powerful feel good film that builds slowly resulting in a realistic portrayal of how we stereotype people before we get to know them.  It is a film that gently exposes the viewer to religious prejudice, generational differences, friendships, and loyalty that is truly heartwarming.  There are laugh out loud scenes interspersed with powerful moments. The casting is outstanding.

It could have been a sit-com....but it's not.

I really loved ""Dough""",1470268800,,320,4.87037037037037

8760052,3,B01F48PJIA,"This film is meant to give us warm fuzzies, and fill our hearts with goodwill and optimism for the future of humankind. It is somewhat charming and in spots mildly amusing. I did slightly enjoy it. But there were a few flaws that that inhibited me really liking it, and even left a slight cynical tang.

Broadly, the story is a bit corny - a few times to the point of slapstick - and the plot is forced in places. The characters all verge on caricatures. Not fatally crude, but all of it was just a bit too bald for my tastes.

Then, there are two specific things that annoyed me quite a bit:

First, (and this is a spoiler) the idea that a bakery could spike its products for a couple weeks with marijuana and hash without everyone immediately understanding what they were eating is absurd to the point of insult. That the apparently oblivious (in more ways than one) clientele would all enjoy being unknowingly stoned is equally stupid. Any adult who has been stoned would understand what was happening, those who haven't would probably guess; many (like myself) would not enjoy it at all, and be rather less than pleased being involuntarily baked by their goods. Also, watching people get stoned is only ever amusing if you happen to be getting stoned with them. Otherwise, it's just annoying. Cheech and Chong are dumb, this was dumber.

Second, quite a few offensive religious stereotypes - mostly of Jews, some of Muslims - are played with here. Meant all in fun with the aim of disarming them, to be sure. Still, I didn't really enjoy most of it. There was one particular scene that brought me up short and got me below the belt: the baker's Jewish family is having a (Shabbat?) dinner including cannabis-infused challah. They don't know why they're high, believing that it's the wine that's particularly good. Hijinks ensue. The baker's preteen granddaughter tells a joke with a punch line that contains ""Jesus Christ"" as an expletive. Now, I know most people won't blink an eye at this; but to me, it's deeply offensive. Having it roll off the lips of a little girl is particularly perverse. Not the sort of thing you expect from a film putatively aimed at increasing ecumenical goodwill and comity, really...

Like I say, this is mostly light and amusing. Most people will like it quite a bit, as the other reviews here prove. I just wish I could have ended up enjoying it more.",1494374400,,2388,4.622641509433962
8760053,1,B01F48PJIA,I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it.  Bought a copy from Amazon to bring to friends outside of the US and the disc is thoroughly corrupted.  Wondering if Amazon will take it back since I purchased it in 2016.,1493856000,,217,4.142857142857143
8760054,5,B01F48PJIA,"A thoroughly delightful movie from start to finish - I love everything about it. It has it all: laughter, intrigue, disappointment, unexpected friendships, suspense, a little late-in-life romance to warm the heart, and a very satisfying ending. This one is not to be missed!",1488758400,,274,5.25
