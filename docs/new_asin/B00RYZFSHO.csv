6936556,1,B00RYZFSHO,"*CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*

Steve Wolsh is single handedly the worst producer, writer and director. I followed this ""horror"" film through it's Kickstarter campaign and read all the articles on horror sites. I was on board the hype train.

The writing is so idiotic and terrible, none of the film makes any sense and even by horror movie standards the characters are beyond dumb (person bleeding out, another has hypothermia, so one of the girls decides to take a shower! All while they are being killed/stalked by killer albinos). All the actors are lost and confused looking in every scene, no doubt it's the combination of terrible writing, nonexistent script and a horrible director. I feel bad their names will forever be immortalized in the credits of this smelly heap of garbage.

Steve Wolsh seemed more concerned for how many women he could feature naked in his film than anything else and if the girls weren't naked, they were swapping clothes with each other or trying on different underwear in the bathrooms of dive bars.

I made it 30 minutes before shutting this garbage off.",1446508800,,1087,4.891304347826087

The movie starts right in the middle of the action, and theres nothing that explains what is happening or why they are there, and part of me loves that idea. There is a sequel coming out that will act as a prequel, and apparently it will set up the events in the first one. But as a first film, the characters suck, the writings awful, and its not wonderfully acted at all. But its shot beautifully and it was all practical effects, so thats a big plus. If you like B- horror films, this is a very unique film.",1444521600,,617,4.065573770491803

The movie has no plot, no sense, and hobbles the talents of the actors with some of the worst dialogue ever put to script. There have long been stupid teenagers in horror flicks, but these characters out-stupid them all. Even then, they aren't as stupid as the aforementioned filmmaker's writing, producing, and directing. None of the characters behave with any logical sense, but that's okay because the things they go through make no sense, either. It's just 98 minutes of bloody mayhem interrupted with scenes of gratuitous female nudity. Just about every female character at one point in the movie goes into a bathroom and strips in front of a mirror. For no reason. The only possible redeeming part of the movie is Lachlan Buchanan's over-the-top performance as his character Troit takes on half a dozen of the pale-skinned ""creepers"" (all of whom are given names in the credits that are never used in the film) trying to kill him. But even that is a clear imitation of Ash from the Evil Dead trilogy. All in all, this movie is a rank piece of garbage that should never have been made. Once seen, it cannot be unseen--no matter how much you wish otherwise.

6936561,1,B00RYZFSHO,"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it makes the films of Ed Wood look Oscar worthy in comparison.

Seriously, just watch the douchebag trailer and then the film, you'll have a laugh. Then again, don't watch either.

Muck has no story to speak of, and yet, SOMEHOW, it still has plot holes from the get-go. Like, when going for help our hero (I guess?) runs past homes so that he can go to a bar where HE DOESN'T ASK FOR HELP but instead flirts around the bar, has a drink, strips and then gabs it up with some girls before asking for one of their phones. Meanwhile, his friends are being attacked when they could've just left as well. Seems like it's way safer to be partying at a bar?

Nothing about the direction and editing make any sense and everything in the movie kinda just happens without any logic or setup.

And there's the no-ending ""ending"". The movie LITERALLY just cuts off. No, your DVD player is not broken,

The movie was advertised to be a hardcore throwback, but the action and violence are amateurishly cut-away from and feel made-for-tv. Girls tend to strip in it, but strategically place there arms over naughty bits because, y'know, that's what women do when they're changing along. They hide even themselves from themselves.

Even from this schmuck who's seen nearly every so-bad-it's-good horror flick, Muck is just shamelessly awful. The movie acts is the equivalent of an obnoxious frat boy that yells about how hard he parties but then passes out after having one Mike's Hard Lemonade. It tries desperately to be ""so cool"", graphically violent and true to its horror roots, but is just a pathetic imitation.

It's baffling that this many people were given money to stand around and say that a literally incomplete movie was a good idea.

It's worth seeing just to see how low the bar has fallen.",1439596800,,1840,4.64

6936566,1,B00RYZFSHO,"There have been a number of recent movies that pay homage to others or parodies: Epic Movie; Disaster Movie; Obsession; Meet the Spartans; many horror movies.  MUCK runs amuck (pardon the pun) and is like a hybrid comparable to Frankenstein's monster which was put together with the body parts of different people (including the brain) and didn't turn out for the better.  The opening scene of MUCK looks as though it lost the entire first reel as a bunch of twenty somethings suddenly emerge from what looks like swampy overgrowth in a tattered, reeling, and hysterical state (a prequel is in the works to explain things which is rather silly). They encounter a solitary house in the middle of nowhere with no phone and no bathroom! The rest of the film deals with having to fend off a bunch of flesh eating albino creatures who appear out of the blue, one of them going for help and winding up in a sleazy bar hangout that just happens to have a bunch of former female winners of Miss Cape Cod (that's where this film takes place), and then a final showdown between the remnants of our group and the albinos that takes place in a swampy area that apparently has quicksand. The movie ends so suddenly that one might think your TV went out. (Stay tuned for a sequel?!)  There is plenty of eye candy (both genders) which the producers intended, though the appearance of the ""ladies"" gets the lion's share of the action (plenty of T&A).  You don't make a movie without a beginning, sensible middle, and no real ending and expect it to fly with futuristic prequels and sequels that haven't even yet appeared.  Whatever it is and whatever clever sidebars (Wes(t) Craven) the movie has, it must stand or fall on its own merits. But, after all, this IS MUCK!",1436918400,2,1752,4.602564102564102

6936571,1,B00RYZFSHO,"The back cover of Muck hails itself as a throwback to 80s horror.  Well if by that they mean a film without anything even remotely resembling a coherent plot and acting which is on a par with the average middle school play, then crack open a bottle and lets celebrate their success.  The film features the directorial debut of Steve Wolsh, who also wrote and produced the film.  The fact that it had its world premiere at the Playboy mansion tells you just about everything you need to know about the production.

Muck is little more than a compilation of about 6 to 8 very beautiful women getting naked for no apparent reason mixed in with some silliness about albino savages who kill them.  And frankly I might have spent a few words too many on describing the core of the film.  A group of friends find themselves lost in the wilderness near Cape Cod, fleeing from who knows what.  Its like the first 20 minutes of the film were just lopped off which is probably a good thing.  The cast includes Jaclyn Swedberg, the 2012 Playboy Playmate of the year, and other less famous actors who play characters named Desiree, Kitty, DeDee, and Messain other words the nightly lineup at every strip clubeverywhere.

Anyway, the group of five friends finds an abandoned house and decides to take shelter.  This of course gives the females the perfect opportunity to use the shower and change clothesa lot.  The five quickly come under attack by a group of pale skinned savages who proceed to torture, chop up, and burn their prey.  Meanwhile, almost unrelated to the rest of the story the action shifts to a dive bar where patrons are celebrating St. Patricks Day.  The females engage in an unending parade to the bathroom where they take off their clothes and admire themselves in the mirror.  Is this really what women do in the bathroom?  And here I thought they actually went to freshen up.  Eventually a couple of these people meet up with survivor from the houseI thinkbecause its hard to tell since the editor seems to have sliced up the film and put it back into a totally random order.  Pretty soon you find yourself losing track of which naked girl was which, not that it matters at that point.

And here is another thingas this is supposed to take place on St. Patricks Day when its technically still winter, the average high temperature in Cape Cod in March is a high of 45 degrees and a low of 30.  That doesnt stop our buxom group of beauties from running around in bikinis, however.  And you can see how bored I became that I actually googled the average temp in Cape Cod.

Now if you look closelyreally closely, you will see horror icon Kane Hodder (who apparently owed someone a favor or had some spare time to kill), playing one of the albino savages.  But his screen time was fleeting and I assume they were paying him by the hour and had to shoot his scenes quickly considering the film was funded by a Kickstarter campaign.

Muck is the first horror film shot in 4K Ultra HD which gives us remarkably crystal clear shots of lots of beautiful, naked women but adds little else.  And to top things off, this was just the first of a planned trilogy.  Muck me!",1433721600,,3168,4.515789473684211

6936575,1,B00RYZFSHO,"So I read previous reviews about this movie. Most people hate it, some people really liked it. For those people who gave this movie positive reviews, 3 stars and up, you are out of your minds. This movie was horrible. There really is a lot of nonsense going on throught this movie, regardless if this was the 2nd movie of 3. (makes no sense then to release a movie out of order)

If you are still thinking about seeing this movie, SPOILER ALERT, here is the movie: 5 friends show up outside a marsh. Two guys, one who is injured, Three women, barely clothed. 2 of their friends apparently died recently but we never find out why or find out why the women are barely clothed. During the opening credits, we see the apparent dead friend, wandering around outside with even less clothes on. Did this really happen? Was this girl somehow lost? Or did she die and then, how did she die? These questions were never answered. So the 5 remaining survivors, break into this huge white house that is near the marsh. After some mind-numbing dialogue, the healthy guy, decides he is going to get help. He leaves his girlfriend there with the injured guy and the 2 barely clothed women. One of these women, freezing in her underwear, decides to take a nap, not find clothes or anything. The other one decides to shower. After some time passes, we find out that some bald, albino farmer looking dudes show up and attack the 3. Some brutality happens.

Elsewhere, the guy who went for help, Noah, goes into town, finds a local bar, decides to clean up in the bathroom, then flips his shirt inside out to hide the muck, sits at the bar and orders a drink. Some bachelorette party is happening in the bar and the apparent bachelorette decides she wants Noah, so she changes dresses in the bathroom with her girlfriend. Pointless T&A. She comes out and tries to flirt with a calm Noah. He asks to use her phone, she says yes but only if he poses for a picture with her and buys her a drink, which he does. He takes her phone and instead of calling the police, calls his douchebag of a cousin, Troit. Troit is hanging out with his female bestie and an apparent date. They are sitting around some empty bar, when the date decides to have a underwear modelling shoot in the bathroom. WTF. After Troit agrees to pick up Noah, does he leave right away? No he stays and has meaningless dialogue/time filler with his female bestie. Noah on his way back, then decides it is ok to stop and peep a woman staring at her half naked self in the mirror. Where does this happen? So many women just staring at themselves in the mirror or changing in bar bathrooms?

Once these 3 are on the road, they come across some of those albino hillbillies. All of a sudden Troit becomes a fighter, the date gets attacked and his car gets flipped upside down. I am not sure if a scene was cut or not, but we never see anyone flip the car, NOR kill the date, yet both happened.

Once Troit meets up with Noah, there are only a few survivors left. In a very dumb scene, Noah and the bestie are trying to keep the doors closed from the Albinos, while Troit stands around doing nothing, and there is a giant hole where a window used to be. Wouldn't it be easier for the Albinos to just go through the space/former window? One finally does and chases a woman upstairs.

After Troit is almost killed (I don't know how he wasn't dead or at least injured), he, bestie and Noah decide to go through the marsh because the Albinos don't go in there....but then one does. A fight ensues. Then the survivors are walking away when you hear something...the beginning of the 3rd movie? No, it was the sound of you being punched in the face and having your money stolen if you bought this movie.

The story, if you can call it that, was all over the place. What happened in the marsh? Where did those albinos come from? Were they rapists or murderers, because half the time you thought rapists but then other times they just killed. Were they indestructable or not? At times, they seemed to die, other times, they got back up. Often horror movies include T&A, but sometimes if fits the movie, other times, it is just gratuitous. There was a lot of pointless T&A here. To top that, the best looking women in the movie, stay clothed (you see them in their underwear).

If in fact 2 other movies are being made, I would expect more of the same: pointless dialogue, excess T&A, nonsense. The first movie would hope to explain things, as in what happened in the swamp, where the albinos came from, what were the friends doing in the first place, what happened to the girls clothes or lack of. I have no idea what the third movie would be about. Maybe how the director got all of these people to be in his movies. Or how these movies actually go the green light to be made.

The title of this movie is very appropriate. If you still decide you want to see it, good muck!",1431302400,2,4902,4.3791208791208796

6936579,1,B00RYZFSHO,"Muck""! What an appropriate title for this mess!

I was expecting a little more from Mr. Jason Vorhees himself (Kane Hooder) than for him to take a turn as such a generic, one-note slasher with such personality as he does here. The kills are few, the gore is minimal and both are done with very little creativity. Sop not only does it not have an intriguing villain, it doesn't work in the essential manner all Slasher films with no other redeeming values must be able to satisfy an audience.

To say the attempts at comedy here are forced is an understatement, the entire set up and the events which follow or just one horror cliche after another, Muck wants to be both a serious terror film and a parody of the genre and by doing so it does not work is either.

Both the characters and the overall writing is so stupendously lazy, inane and superficial that it makes the camp counselors in the Friday the 13th movies look like Harvard professors.

Making matters worse it also has no sense of pace and often resorts to having the surviving characters yammer on for minutes on end about nothing in the middle of an attack, or an unnecessarily extended scene in a bar at about the half hour mark which really seems like an obvious ploy to stretch out the film's length, when they should be fleeing for their lives (an obvious effort to bring the threadbare story up to it's greatly inflated 99 minute run time). Here is where the Comedic aspect might've had a moment to work if the writers and the characters were smart enough to make an announce about how ridiculous it is to be reminiscing about better times as a killer follows us (as Wes Craven would've done in the Scream films). But, of the many jokes that annoy more than entertain this observation is never thrown into the dialogue.

It's one of those modern movies where every single shot seems to be shown in slow motion (again, my best bet would be to pad the run time to feature length and hide the lack of story) to no avail until only further add frustration to its audience. The appropriately bleak cinematography as one of the few positives notes to be found here but it never generates any suspense whatsoever, it ends out of nowhere and there is an undeniable ring of sexism to the way it treats its female characters.

At least the end credits have a nice grindhouse vibe to them and the story of a group of clueless teens coming out of the mud referenced so eloquently in the title and being forced to either die by Kane Hooder' hand or retreat back to it is at least a little bit of a semi creative differentiation on the usual hack and slash story. Still, it starts out quickly with this idea and we realize within the first few minutes it is the only inventive thought in this wasteland of celluloid and that the screenplay doesn't have the inventiveness to carry on with the thought as it immediately thrusts its usual whiny, hormone crazed teenagers into a house they don't think twice about walking into. This makes it's only solid idea too little, too late and nowhere near enough to save this cinematic disaster.",1430179200,2,3089,4.507142857142857

You're just there in some marshlands, looking at some half-naked chicks, an injured guy and his buddy appearing out of nowhere, running from something ! From whom, we'll never know !

Amateurish acting on top of that !

Maybe some good sfx splatter will save this flick from total boredom....nah, forget about that too !
Nearly ALL the blood effects happen off-camera ! Some hilbilly albino killer swinging his axe and the victim gets it....yea, right, OFF-CAMERA.
Well, I think this was made for budgetary reasons, you need money to pay for all the T&A appearances.
Yes, the T&A quotas in this movie are off the charts. Well, I don't have problems with that, but when you're bombarded with nakedness every other minute...women starting to strip suddenly in restrooms of some shady bars, changing bras, panties, dresses...it's a fashion show all of a sudden !
Some chick is even carrying around here complete lingerie collection in her handbag (Yes, of course, all women do that, I forgot...). Then, this gets ridicously boring too, a lot !

They have no phones, no money, and in one case no shoes. They run to the creepy house where one of them decides to go back through the swamp to get help. He goes to a bar, watches some semi naked women, then borrows a phone to call his cousin to meet him in the creepy town - no address of course. Then he pisses off the women in the bar and heads back through the swamp to meet his cousin at the creepy house. None of this movie made any sense. Stupid people doing stupid things, killers without back story or motive, and horrendous editing make this one of the worst movies I have seen in years, and I watch a lot of horror movies. And then to top it off, the two survivors look off-screen and say ""this can't be good""... as the credits start to roll. Kane Hodder - WHY???

6936589,1,B00RYZFSHO,Made this movie experience into a drinking game. Everytime we saw random T&A we drank. Stupid movie led to awesome drinking buzz. If I paid for this movie I would have been pissed,1428105600,,179,4.454545454545454
6936590,1,B00RYZFSHO,"At least the movie is aptly named - it really is muck. I was hoping, based on the synopsis and the title and the muddy location, that the movie would involve some kind of deadly ooze, like killer mud. Turns out, I had way more imagination than the makers of this drek - their 'monster' is a clay-covered dude with sharp teeth and an ax. This, btw, is not a spoiler, because he shows up in the first ten minutes (and besides, you can't spoil garbage). That might be the least bad thing about this crap-fest: the monster is a clay-looking dude with an ax.

I tried to sit through this whole movie to give a more accurate review (and to see if it would make good background noise for other stuff I have to do).
The attempt wasn't QUITE as painful as standing next to a running chainsaw with no earmuffs, but it was close. The problem is the characters - NONE of them act like humans and all of them seem to have anti-survival skills. Despite being chased by something, having two of their friends killed and a third seriously wounded, and suffering from exposure, their only concession to the seriousness of the situation is to jabber endlessly about who is going to die next and similar, in between inanities like hitting on each other and debating whether they should take shelter in THE ONLY HOUSE IN A DOZEN MILES...while they are dying of cold and being pursued. None of them exhibits the slightest urgency, and we are forced to endure endless minutes of them doing whatever random thing comes into their heads. They don't even bandage the one who is bleeding >: [
The movie doesn't really seem to care about the situation either; it quickly cuts away to a bar scene and more endless minutes of unimportant characters doing unimportant things that don't advance the plot. When the main character phones for help, he says he is ""in some trouble right now"", and that's the extent of the urgency in his message. He doesn't even get upset when his would-be rescuer delays listening to him in order to flirt with girls (the line is open by then, so he can totes hear their inane banter).

I could rant about this piece of crud for hours, but instead, I will leave you with the part that topped it all off for me before I turned this garbage off:
The characters are apparently in an area called ""Wes Craven"" (yes, like the GOOD horror guy). The friend they call for rescue (sorry, I meant call for pick-up-whenever) comments ""Wes Craven - that place used to be cool, but lately...eh"", and then finishes with ""Alright, I'll be there. But dude, if it's some boring Wes Craven s***, I'm gonna be pissed"". People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, movie.",1427846400,3,2660,4.516597510373444

6936592,4,B00RYZFSHO,"A group of young adults are out one summer during St. Patrick's in the wilds of Cape Cod in the town of Wes(t) Craven. They are being hunted by Kane Hodder and company who hack them up and rip off the tops of women...and then hack them up. We don't know who or why. The kids reaction in not getting the police is inane. The bad guys appear to be the offspring of Michael Berryman. Nothing makes sense except that the film was designed that way.

This is a spoof of the 80's horror/slasher film. In fact Billy (Grant Alan Ouzts) comically explains who dies and why and in what order. He even claims Kylie is too classy to show her boobs and it is even in her contract...a little hint that the top billed Playboy starlet keeps her top on. Nothing makes sense. All the women were beautiful. There was an abundance of nudity. The only thing missing was a chainsaw.

In addition to the frequent topless scenes, I also liked the dialogue, sort of like buying Playboy for the articles. I caught a street name in the film and searched it on line only to find a 1862 square foot house on said road in West Dennis Cape Cod that rents itself out and looked identical to the one in the film in case you are looking for a vacation home used in a B horror film. I am in no way connected to the film, but did visit Cape Cod once.

It is a film not to be taken seriously. $9.96 US Walmart.

6936594,5,B00RYZFSHO,"I heard about Muck from a friend and decided to give it a shot. It helped that I went into it knowing it was the middle movie of a trilogy, but I thought not knowing what happened to the group as they exited the swamp in the beginning added to the dynamic of the film. I watched this with a bunch of friends and we weren't disappointed lol. From start to finish this is just an overall fun movie. We started a drinking game to it- had four rules:
every time someone says f*ck
every time someone takes their shirt off or their shirt gets ripped off
every time a ridiculous amount of blood is shed
every time a smart, horror movie decision is made

Lets just say we barely made it out of the movie alive. Excited for the next one and the drinking game that comes with it. 5/5",1427414400,4,773,4.119205298013245
6936595,2,B00RYZFSHO,"This is what happens when you inexpertly try to make both a satire and an homage. I'm not saying it can't be done: that's where we get some of our best exploitation films. But done unevenly, the audience struggles to know when they should laugh and when they should be legitimately titillated, making the whole movie feel like it's got an identity crisis. I wouldn't be surprised if Steve Wolsh, the newbie writer/director of the film, intended the film to do both at the same time, but those lofty goals come nowhere close to being met.

This is too bad, since I actually like the premise. Basically, a group of people emerge from a marsh having just barely escaped some horrible attack that has left two of their members dead and the rest of them in various states of injury/nudity. They seek refuge in the first house they see, where they are soon attacked by a new evil: bald, albino bodybuilders called Creepers. It's a clever way of playing with the genre, and it may have earned Wolsh some brownie points with a few of his angrier critics if he had made it clear that this was actually Part 2 of a three-part series he had planned. At the very least, it would've made the abrupt ending, the rushed opener, and the gaping plot holes seem a little more acceptable.

The film tries really hard; I'll give it that. And I give major points to the majority of the cast (most notably the women), who are clearly asked to do some difficult work, which they do wholeheartedly. There are a lot of impressive sequences (the noose through the window), some really well framed/planned shots (Troit with his shovel at the end of the Marsh battle), and decent effects for such a limited budget. It is quite clear that a lot of love and effort went into the film.

Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie (among many), the problem that kills it more than anything else, is its seriously clunky script. It tries to achieve a winking awareness (it is clearly inspired by Scream), but its various jokes and references are so glaringly obvious that they land like lead. Part of this is the pacing of the film -- it is incapable of carrying any one tone for too long, so it is constantly switching abruptly from humor to horror to shameless nudity without ever really finding a way to mix them together or even just blend the seams. Part of it is also the delivery. Our two most meta characters are Billy and Troit. Aside from a few extra pounds and overall luck, they are basically the same guy: the wise-cracking male who thinks it's charming just how shameless he is about being a sleazeball. Their canned banter is so rehearsed and self-aware (and just generally hacky) that it quickly grates.

They're there for a reason, though. There's virtually nothing to the rest of the plot. The rest of the film can be divided into the same basic segments:

A. Attack Scenes: These are mostly of Creepers using blades to kill people in scenes that have a lot of blood, but are still not very gory because they are over-edited into incomprehensibility.

B: Boob & Butt Scenes: At least eight different times in the film, young women stare for hours at their own half-naked bodies in various bathroom mirrors. Ironically, these scenes go on so long without ever really going anywhere (we literally just watch them stare at themselves; it's like a live action underwear catalogue), that the movie manages to make T&A boring. After all, this movie is marketed for straight guys, and when straight guys want this much nudity this badly, they'll usually just get a porno. There's a lot less fast forwarding involved that way.

C: Complaining Scenes: People complain about how much everything sucks. This gets a bit repetitive.

The soundtrack is -- amazingly -- both shy and distracting. Wolsh uses a wide variety of songs, but instead of adding eclectic flair, they just inspire confusion. Much like the breakneck tonal shifts in the film, the soundtrack jumps from soulful indie to heavy metal to country. It makes transitions from one scene to the next even more awkward and jarring.

If the film wasn't so smug, if the nudity was trimmed (ahem) and incorporated more reasonably into the story, if the gore/deaths weren't obscured with such chaotic editing, if the script quit tried half as hard to be funny and twice as hard to be clever, if all of this: Muck might have worked. Maybe.

But not all of that. Unfortunately. If Part 1 or 3 DO get made, hopefully Wolsh will learn from what does and doesn't work about this film. He dropped the ball here, but it's clear that he's got the chops somewhere inside of him. It's one of those things where you just have to keep hacking away until you find them.",1427414400,10,4685,4.626955475330926

6936608,4,B00RYZFSHO,"Horror movies made by today's generation FOR today's generation really suck. The modern iteration of the horror movie has become a fest of pointless splatter gore tacked onto an extremely meta plot that takes itself far too seriously, weighed down by way way WAY too many pointless CGI effects.

""Muck"" thankfully, is not only just a return to the classic horror movie type, it avoids becoming too self-referential for it's own good. And in that sense, there's something here for horror fans of every age.

All the classic horror film benchmarks are here. Impossibly hot college kids that are all kinds of dumb, spend WAY too much time staring at themselves in the mirror, & make REALLY poor decisions in a crisis!! A wry sense of humor! A dark and creepy Cape Cod town with lots of scary houses of death! Shower scenes! Creepy albino farmer bad guys! Horror movie ICON Kane Hodder! And it's St. Patrick's Day too!

What really makes ""Muck"" stand out from the horror movie pack are it's visuals. Shot entirely by first-time Director Steve Wolsh on Red Epic in 4K Ultra HD, with a complete wall-to-wall musical score, & using all PRACTICAL visual effects without a TRACE of today's over-relied on CGI. And the film is HEAVY with impressive, high-impact stuntwork. There's enough fights, falls, and explosions here to satisfy even the most jaded film buff. It helps the movie establish the constant threat of danger & maintains momentum through the character building/plot exposition moments. Everyone who dies in the movie is inevitably SOME kind of jerk, but because of the visceral nature of the death scenes, you end up feeling the impact of their loss SO much more. Not a lot of movies can lay claim to pulling that off.

The one thing that might throw audiences watching the film is it's continuity. It initially seems like it jumps around randomly out of order from event to event. However, the film's continuity is actually EXTREMELY tight, and I urge you to stay with the film, no matter how confused you might be in those first few minutes. When ""Muck"" begins, our cast is already noticeably roughed up & on the run..which kind of feels like they just walked straight out of an entirely different horror movie. And you're not wrong. ""Muck"" is actually the middle film of a trilogy...with a prequel currently in production. But even starting the party already halfway through, the film suffers no loss of storytelling. In fact, it only heightens the viewer's interest to not only eventually discover how this tale begins, but who ends up surviving to tell it. It's a bold & risky narrative choice to make, but it works well.

Even though it's neither the beginning or the end of the story, ""Muck"" is a satisfying and complete crowd-pleasing film all on it's lonesome. What more could you really ask for? Watch it late at night with the lights out. And your doors locked.",1426982400,4,2877,4.780684104627767

The reason they were able to do so is because they never really show anything when a kill takes place. The camera just cuts away and someone gets splattered with blood from off camera.

I learned something after watching MUCK that I wish I had known beforehand: this film is the first of a trilogy.  Had I known that prior, I would have enjoyed the experience much more so.  Why?  Primarily because the ending would not have infuriated me as much.  Now, don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed the film overall.  Its made well and shot on a RED camera, so it looks great onscreen.  But, there are a few things about it that I feel need to be addressed.

Judging from some of the other reviews Ive read on MUCK, this is one of those films you either love or hate.  Public opinion seems to be pretty evenly mixed.  Interestingly, I find myself in the middle.  I really enjoyed certain aspects of the filmhowever, I also did not like certain things as well.

MUCK is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  As I mentioned, its filmed on a RED camera, so the film quality is excellent.  This is important to note, as most of the film takes place at night.  On lesser cameras, the image is grainy or too dark to see.  Here, the picture shines in all of its HD glory.

The acting in MUCK is also a high note.  Granted, its not superb, but the cast still does a good job in their portrayals.  I always enjoy seeing Kane Hodder onscreen, and he delivers as expected.  But I also particularly like Lachlan Buchanans performance as Troit, the smart-ass cousin of the character Noah.  Buchanan does a stellar job with his role, and Im glad to see hes going to be in the sequel.

The special effects in MUCK are amazing.  The film boasts all practical effects (no CG here!), and the result is a supremely satisfying and entertaining gore-fest.  I commend the production team for insisting on practicals, as it makes the horror so much more believable.

But for all of its positives, there are several glaring negatives.  First and foremost is the storyline, or more specifically, the lack of information in the storyline.  The film starts off right after a harrowing incident in the marsh.  The audience is not told what has transpired, but I assumed we would find out later on in the film.  Unfortunately, thats not the case.  The group shows up to a house and then starts getting attacked.  But whom or what, we have no idea.  This would have been fine, IF we had eventually discovered what was going on.  Im assuming we have to wait until the sequel(s) to see.

Another big sticking point for me is the ending.  Even if I had known this was part of a trilogy, I still would have been upset with it.  Abrupt is too mild of a word to describe it.  It justends.  I actually yelled at my TV when the credits started.

Still, MUCK does have quite a bit of entertainment value as a whole.  I actually do recommend the film, as it has A LOT of potential, and I can see a whole franchise series stemming from it.  The film is available now in a variety of formats if you decide to give it a look.",1426636800,2,2964,4.355311355311355
6936622,5,B00RYZFSHO,"This was an awesome back to the way old style Horror Films were made.  Some of the more modern CGI BS is not in this film and that is what makes it all the better.  Realistic looking blood,  intense fight scene horror style and so on.  Plus I think Kane Hodder in this one was outstanding.
This is worth more than a one time watch for sure and certainly will stay in my private collection of Horror Films for years to come.  I know some may be critical of the naked girls,  but like I said this was back to an old style that has been lost in modern years.
It is what true fans of this type of genre have wanted to see come back for a while.",1426636800,4,640,3.9224806201550386
6936623,1,B00RYZFSHO,"I just finished watching what I was hoping would be a good, gory horror film. Now I realize how I have wasted time, money, and precious brain cells on one of the absolute worst films to ever burn my retinas. Terribly scripted, directed, and edited, laced with misogyny, homophobia, and even xenophobia (note to filmmakers - Google these terms)!  Baffling in every way imaginable, the ""film"" veers into bizarre fetishized tangents any time a female enters a bathroom and looks in a mirror or some reflective object.  It has to (not be) seen to be believed. The title of the ""film"" is never developed or explained - unless one interprets the whole mess as a disastrous ""Muck."" Avoid at all costs!!",1426550400,6,695,4.735537190082645
6936624,1,B00RYZFSHO,"There are two principle reasons to watch this flick: T&A and the film's laugh out loud quality scripting. And to be clear, you'll be laughing at the ""film"", not with it. Of course, you have to love Kickstarter for giving aspiring film producers & directors the opportunity to realize their vision. Even if the vision in question is topless women attempting to act out a screenplay that appears to have been written over Jagerbombs in a frat basement between 2 and 2:15 in the morning. This movie makes absolutely no sense. but to be fair... I haven't had this much fun mocking a movie in years.

Examples and half-spoilers (but not really)
The opening scene shows a handful of half-naked girls and guys in the middle of the swamp who appear to have just survived ... something. We never find out what and it's apparently not that important. There's a guy who runs for help, but has time to stop and engage in some Peeping Tom activities on the way, reaches a bar, hits the bathroom, then orders a shot. What about his dying friends? Not, apparently, an issue. A car flips over... I don't know why. There are some powdery white dudes who may or may not be dead, but who apparently can't attack someone without impaling themselves on a pitchfork. Phones don't work anywhere. Jokes also don't work anywhere. And the acting and directing... the less said about those, the better.",1426377600,26,1375,4.658436213991769
6936625,3,B00RYZFSHO,"First of all, this is not a 1-star movie. I have seen enough of shaky camera movies with no acting, no story and shot with an iPhone (the old one, judging by quality) to know a 1-star movie when I see it. the movie is well shot and well acted, which brought me to the conclusion that they had the skills to do better.

It is a pretty intense slather, however there are a few scenes where people behave unrealistically as to what his happening. One really strange thing about the movie is all the implied nudity. You heard me right: implied nudity. As in chicks undress, but you don't get to see it. Maybe the BluRay version is different than the streaming version, but come one dudes, if you are not going to show it, just don't make scenes where girls change clothes, take shower, or being undressed by the ""creeps"", totaling many minutes of the movie. What's the point of her ""being naked"" if you talk about it and not show it?",1426291200,5,929,4.339080459770115
6936626,1,B00RYZFSHO,"A movie this dumb ought not be hard to understand, and someone making a slasher movie should know that the viewer deserves to both have fun and see something new. The movie seems to be marketed at the moment to the overlap demographic of horror fans and the lotion and tissue crowd, but while there are a lot of attractive women running around in skimpy clothes and briefly no clothes, which is arguably fun at first, but gets weird the more it starts feeling like a fetish film for fans either of third-billed lead actor Lachlan Buchanan or, more disturbingly his character Troit, but Frank Kress was never filmed bare chested and backlit by fire with, I am not kidding, a noose around his neck. WTF? It is either an incredibly tone-deaf choice, bound to alienate a lot of good people, or it is deliberate for reasons I don't want to begin to guess at. Do you really want to waste your time trying to find out.",1426204800,6,911,4.461077844311378

6936629,5,B00RYZFSHO,"Incredible real effects (no CGI), lighting, soundtrack and casts (read beautiful girls) with humor mixed in made this an amazing horror flick.

6936630,1,B00RYZFSHO,"Besides being probably the most confusing and half assed storytelling I have seen in a film in years, this film MAKES NO SENSE! It is not so much a horror move as it is an excuse for the makers of the film to get a bunch of young girls naked for no reason at all.  I get that in horror movies, but usually there is a good excuse (like plot development) and not because the makers are total horn dogs. But I guess they were riding on the whole sex sells idea.

The awful editing, inde college student camera work, bad writing, and lack of any kind of a scare what so ever does not help the film.

The fact that we start off in the middle of the film and are never keyed in to why they are in the situation that they are in is befuddling to me. This makes me question why this film was ever made in the first place. The writing is awful.

I will give props to the production quality, the SFX. But that's about it.

Filled with every horror movie cliche in the book, Muck never amounts to much but a film that is mid line pornagraphic and doesn't have a much of a story, scare, or plotline behind it.  I'd like both my my money and my 90 plus minutes back. Don't wast your time on this one. Rewatch Friday the 13th or Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead. You'll thank me for it later.",1425772800,19,1277,4.067729083665339
6936631,1,B00RYZFSHO,I can't believe I paid to see this trash. No plot to speak of. It's like the movie starts in the middle and never explains anything. Then the MO ie abruptly ends. If your looking for a scary movie keep looking. If you want to see an hour and a half of girls in bras & panties with an occasional murder this is for you.,1425686400,5,318,3.9076923076923076
6936632,5,B00RYZFSHO,"I have to admit, I had no idea what I was getting myself into when purchasing Muck, but I am really really glad I did. Judging from the trailer, I was convinced this was another movie with hot half naked chicks running around and (as a girl) I was pleasantly surprised that it was way way more. The dialogue is really funny and pretty clever - one of my favorite scenes being when one of the actors points out that based on how many people were left and basic horror story math, they were all ""goners"".

Another interesting note I had, was the amount of hidden gems in the background of the scenes - The production company With an O, did some shameless plugs which I thought was both clever and entertaining.

I recommend this movie full heartedly, I definitely have never seen anything like it.",1425686400,6,795,4.438356164383562

Seriously its 90 minutes of terrible dialogue followed by girls changing clothes in the bathroom, albino creatures stripping girls to their underwear and then killing them. It just makes no sense and if they either focused on the nudity, the story, or the scares this could have been better.",1425686400,5,335,5.0
6936634,3,B00RYZFSHO,"Muck was basically a vehicle to showcase naked and half naked girls running around with blood all over them. In the beginning I thought they were going to go the straight slasher route with extra T&A. But then it became quite comical, spouting such lines as (if it makes you feel any better ,my car got tossed on the hot chick I was gonna bang tonight).It's also full of Scream-esque horror references and some clever horror film puns. Unfortunately the movie itself is muddled and all over the place.

The bald albino creatures are creepy and effective at first but they became somewhat ineffective after being visible for so long. There was a lot of blood splatter but not anything hard core like decapitations or severed limbs. Basically Axes to the chest in darkened lighting and impalement  by pitchfork .Although they do shine in other areas where effects are concerned. Lachlan Buchanan was hilarious as ""Troit"" an intoxicated dude that's really good at killing these creatures.

This movie could go either way .People could really like it or maybe not so much.depends on what you're looking for in a slasher film. If you want lots of T&A, Comic relief and lots of blood splatter then you will love it. If you want a scary slasher flick that plays it straight you won't.

There was no perceivable story.

No discernible reason for anything that happened.

So okay. What was the point of this scene in the still frame?

Pure torture porn exploitation and nothing more. Utterly mindless.
