2460468,5,B000CEV3N2,"This product is GREAT!! I had lower back/hip pain which could have come from a variety of things(Sports, Training, Auto Accident etc.) to which I still don't know the cause, however once I used this product. I haven't even felt the pain anymore!!! It's real! It works!! All you have to do is like Elaine Says ""lie there and let the Ball and gravity re-align & heal your body"" I recommend Highly!!!",1144368000,32,397,4.527777777777778
2460469,1,B000CEV3N2,"Like another reviewer, I bought this over the book thinking it would provide most of the same information.  WRONG!! Only lower back work was included. After I little research, I found out that the book includes MUCH, MUCH MORE.  I wish I could return the DVD set and buy the book set.  Don't be disappointed: Buy the book.",1143590400,25,322,4.517241379310345
2460470,3,B000CEV3N2,"The balls work great, but the DVD only barely shows you how to begin with using them - for your pelvis/back only.  There is no instruction for neck, shoulders, lower back.  There is too much emphasis on breathing and a ""body dialogue"" which is a bit hokey, but would be palatable if there had been complete instructions on using the balls.  It is a cheap trick to only give ""introductory"" instruction - you have to buy other CDs to get full instruction.  This leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth, and a feeling of being taken.

All of that said, I do like the balls themselves, so it wasn't a complete disappointment.  Too bad they took the low road.  I hate feeling like I was snookered.",1141344000,20,693,4.3671875
2460471,5,B000CEV3N2,"Surprisingly, what I learned that has helped me the most from this DVD doesn't even require the balls, though they feel great when I do use them at home.

The part about just sitting (I sit on my coffee table when the students in the DVD sit on their benches) and dropping your head down and feeling the gravity and giving myself time to really feel the muscles is something I do all the time now.  That doesn't sound like any big revelation, does it?  But somehow it's different when she's instructing you on how to ""listen"" to your body.

I travel a lot and this one technique has relieved a tremendous amount of discomfort for me, from my shoulders all the way down to my lower spine.  I can use it standing in line at a ticket counter or in my cramped seat.  It's fantastic!!",1139529600,30,779,4.301369863013699
2460472,5,B000CEV3N2,"I'm the typical computer user, hunched over my computer 8 hours a day as my shoulders crawl up to my ears and my back gets stiffer and stiffer. Recurring tension and pain in my back was pretty much status quo for me until I was introduced to Elaine Petrone's method last year. I took a class with her and felt better almost immediately. Since then I've used her breathing and positioning techniques at home. I'm happy to report that the DVD is the next best thing to taking a class with Elaine. On the DVD she really takes the time to introduce you to each position and offer alternatives (using one ball or two depending on your specific issue). I hadn't realized how much I forgot from her class and how many more things I can do to alleviate the general tension and achiness in my back. After doing the DVD I felt the same way I did after taking her class - better!",1139529600,28,868,4.298780487804878
2460473,3,B000CEV3N2,"I had heard some good reviews about the ""miracle balls"" and when I saw this package with a DVD, I bought this over the version with the book. Unfortunately, what I thought I was buying and what I got were two different things.  The DVD cover talks about shoulder/neck pain, back, etc. and what the DVD actually covers is an introduction for the back area.  I guess if you want to know about other areas of the body you will need to buy her other DVD's (suprise!).  It would have been more helpful to have included the book with this package then I think it would have been worth the money.  While the DVD is okay, it is just an introduction with not a lot of explanation.  For example, Ms. Petrone has one person use one ball while another uses two.  She states she will explain why later but never gets around to it. It's a DVD I would watch one time and that is it - not as a regular routine.  While my back was relaxed afterwards, I do not have any pain in it so I'm not sure how helpful it is.  Where I do have pain (shoulder area) was not helped with this routine.",1139097600,19,1069,4.130434782608695

I first found them at Costco but then they stopped carrying them. If I use them on a regular basis I'm sure I would never have my back go out at all. Thing is, I get lazy when I'm out of pain and stop using them. But when it happens again I just ""get on the balls"" and can make a huge shift. The other thing that really helps if I feel it tensing up is to lye prone position over a yoga ball and I can feel it melt away.

2460496,3,B000CEV3N2,"I bought this directly from Acacia a number of years ago.  I remember opening the box, realizing it wasn't for upper back pain, and setting it aside.  Then, last weekend, I don't know what I did, but my lower back started killing me.  It hurt to do pretty much everything that involved turning sideways, getting up from a chair, bending over, or even rolling over in bed.  Advil, Tylenol, and BenGay did nothing for me.  Even a heating pad didn't work.  And then I remembered this DVD set.  (Mine came with a DVD, 2 smaller balls, and a CD.  I don't see mention of the CD anywhere else, but I think I have the same DVD as the other reviewers because I noticed the same things -- like Ms. Petrone never saying why you would choose one ball instead of two, even though she promises she will.)

What I like about the set:

*It provides a non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical method for dealing with pain
*I did find pretty much instantaneous relief from my back pain, while I was using the balls
*It's relatively inexpensive and if you are desperate, it might be worth a try

What I don't like about the set:

*The pain relief was not long-lasting; as soon as I got off the balls, my back started hurting again with exactly the same intensity (this did not match with the experiences described in the testimonials on the DVD)
*The content of the DVD was quite repetitive and even a little boring

Why do I think this didn't provide long-lasting relief?  Well, my hypothesis is that my back pain is acute.  While I can't be certain, I think my pain is the result of overstretching (overcompensation in correcting for bad posture).  The best comparison I can make is to the pain that hits you a day after a workout, when you use muscles you haven't used in a long while.  My pain was not -- I think -- the result of any kind of tension.  It's not chronic pain.  I suspect if you do have tension-based, chronic back pain, your experiences might mirror the those of positive reviewers and the testimonials on the DVD.

I'm not thrilled about the DVD.  I think it might be worth watching at least once so you can get a sense of what to do with the balls.  Please be aware that the first 5-7 minutes are a bunch of testimonials that play like a late-night infomercial.  Also, the DVD doesn't have much replay value.  I say that from the perspective of someone who does a lot of kundalini yoga, much of which is done on the floor with the eyes closed, and which involves a lot of meditation and relaxation time.  (In other words, I'm used to follow-along DVDs that involve a lot of quiet time.)

One big idea of the method is the body dialogue.  Sit there (or lie there), do something to change your position (like lean forward or raise your arms up), then return to the original position.  You're told to observe the changes.  Apparently breathing out with a hissing ""SSSSS"" sound is supposed to help you observe these changes.  I mean, I tried it.  It certainly wasn't any stranger than any of the meditations/mantras/seed sounds I've done during yoga.  But I didn't feel or notice any differences after the ""SSSSS.""  I'm also not sure what the end result of the ""dialogue"" is supposed to be.  I performed the actions demonstrated on the DVD.  I did sometimes feel a difference in the way my body settled after returning to my original position.  But I don't get what that's supposed to mean.

I come from a science background, and I'm used to making lots of observations.  But those observations usually lead to a conclusion, and I felt any discussion of a conclusion was lacking here.  What I mean is, depending on the results of the observations of my body/back/etc., I would expect to get some advice on something to change so that the results of the ""dialogue"" would be different, the next time I performed it.  You know, as part of a strategy to reduce back pain.  I mean, maybe the whole dialogue is supposed to be a type of relaxation?  I don't know.

In the DVD, Ms. Petrone walks a man and a woman through a series of exercises.  There's a lot of talk between the exercises, including the participants discussing how the exercises make them feel.  I do think it's useful to listen to them once; my situation was a little bit like the woman's.  But I wouldn't watch the DVD again, I'd probably just make note of the individual exercises and do them on my own with something more interesting playing in the background.  There's just too much ""sitting around and listening"" time on the DVD; I sort of felt like I was wasting time.  Perhaps if it had been cut in half, lengthwise, I would've felt differently.  (The CD that came with my set had a lot of the same content as the DVD.  I was so bored after the second section of the CD that I took it out of the player and didn't finish it.  I tried, I really did, to give everything a full and honest chance.)

In the end, I do believe people when they say this method worked for them.  I do believe the balls could be useful tools in relieving chronic lower back pain.  I might even try using them for a bit every day to get temporary relief until my muscles heal on their own.  But if your back pain -- like mine -- is the result of an intense workout or overstretching, you're probably not going to see a huge benefit.",1372204800,5,5264,4.421436004162331
2460497,5,B000CEV3N2,I have put a fortune into chiropractic and massage and using the Elaine Petrone Method works as well or close to using a professional.  I have hips that go out causing sciatic problems and a neck injury from birth both of which can keep me in tears through sleepless nights and difficult days.  I don't like spin to sell something and I get nothing from reviewing this but the Method has been a blessing that can come with me wherever I go unlike a chiropractor. I am sure there are times I will still use one but not the weekly I had been doing for over 15 years.  Thank you Elaine!,1370822400,,583,4.2342342342342345
2460498,5,B000CEV3N2,"I was in pain when I ordered this.  I watched the video and once I stopped making fun of it, I listened to what she (just a girl who licked her pain), try to explain how!  It sounds funny the ssssss noise but I swear if you listen to her and do as she says really try and understand what she is explaining and do it!!!! The way she says and WOW! I would sit and do my body diologue and feel pain and tension in three places  when I got done with my excercise and did it again I felt none no pain.  I have also been seeing a Chiropractor and a Massage therapist both agree this method is a good one, since my therapist uses tennis balls on her back the same way!

2460500,5,B000CEV3N2,"I bought the DVD with 2 balls included around 5 or 6 years ago.  I was experiencing pain or tension in the back and it seemed that everything I did just worsened the pain for me.  I could not find any relief until I happened to see this on Amazon.  I could not imagine 2 little balls helping but thought I would have to try it to understand.  I watched the video and frankly thought a lot of it was unnecessary so after watching the whole thing I decided to try it.  I stopped the video to the point where the 2 balls were actually being used (the beginning is simply relaxation exercises) then got on the floor on my back with knees to my chest and the video on. I placed the balls one at a time under each cheek of my rear-end and held the knees to the chest as suggested then as I felt relief to the back tension, I slowly opened the knees outward and held that position.  This does not sound relaxing but I am here to tell you that it is extremely relaxing.  I would slowly bring the knees in and hold then out and hold.  After just one time of doing this procedure, I swear I thought I was cured.  However, I didn't want to hurt anymore so I continued doing this several times a day and after just a few days, I didn't need to do it anymore. This method was such a miracle for me that I immediately went back to Amazon and bought 4 more and sent them to family and friends. I gave the balls to my grandson to play with when he was a baby and never got them back so here I am back at Amazon buying another set for myself.  I have continued to recommend this method to friends but it seems that most people are not willing to give it a chance thinking just as I did at first that they could not imagine something so simple working so well.  I am here to tell you that it does work and you need to try it and give it a good try before dismissing it saying it doesn't work as some other reviewers have.  If you do not understand the instructions, read it again(or watch it again)and again and again until you do.  I cannot imagine not understanding but then maybe I am just extremely intelligent - that's a joke!  Just follow the instructions I have given above and use it that way.  I ordered not only the relaxation method but the toning also because I know what the Elaine Petrone Method can do.  The reason this works is that the use of the ball under the butt relaxes and stretches those back muscles which is usually the reason for pain along with inflamation.  In addition you can use ice on the back to take out the inflamation.  Take into account that I am NOT an MD nor do I pretend or represent myself as any kind of expert but I do know what works.",1334102400,19,2661,4.084615384615384
2460501,3,B000CEV3N2,Either I didn't read the description right or there are several different versions.  What I wanted were all the exercises to follow on a DVD so I didn't have to use the book while I was trying to position the balls.  This is just a basic introduction to her method with a few basic positions.,1328486400,6,292,4.290909090909091

2460503,5,B000CEV3N2,"I love this method! I have used it on and off for several years. The concept is simple, gravity does the work and using the breath to release excess tension allows the body to relax. This is explained throughout the DVD. Elaine explaines that, ""feeling the body is the fist step to changing the way the body aligns.""

I have had only a positive experience with the balls. Her method is almost like accupressure in the joints. Also, it is explained to go at your own pace. People who are very tight in the joints may feel alot of excess pain that they are use to ignoring and it may seem as if injury has been caused by doing the method.

I have had various injuries before I tried this method. I purchased this in an attempt to HELP MYSELF HEAL, and it does help.
The most important aspect I have learned through using this method is to allow healing to happen.

Finally, if you are ready to get in touch with your body, I highly recommend giving it a try.",1262044800,18,956,4.2707182320441985
2460504,2,B000CEV3N2,"The balls are fine, but I was really disappointed in the video.  It was about 45 minutes long and gave very little information about her method and why it works, the goals, etc.  There are two subjects in the video, one using 1 ball and the other using 2 balls and no explanation as to why or what might be better for you.  It seemed very unprofessional to me.",1261180800,14,360,4.188405797101449

2460506,2,B000CEV3N2,"On the plus side, this has about 5-10 minutes of useful advice and the balls feel pretty good--I prefer them for some areas to harder massage tools.  However, the video is about 45 minutes long, so that's a high haystack/needle ratio.  She also never gets around to explaining some things, like why she has her sample woman put two balls under her back while the sample man only uses one (she says she'll explain in a minute, but she never does).  She doesn't explain how the balls work or give any cautions about using them, and reviews of her other products show that people have injured themselves on them.  So, I'd check with someone with good knowledge of anatomy about how to place the balls and where to avoid using them.  If you want the balls, I'd order the book instead since it's cheaper and presumably has more information.  I've watched the DVD once (parts twice to try and find her explanation of ball placement, which never happened).  I'll probably never watch it again as all the useful info is easily remembered.  I've used the balls a few times, but I can't say they've helped.  I wouldn't say this product is worthless, but I'd only value it at about $5.",1231804800,22,1174,4.552380952380952

The product desc mentions nothing about ""balls not included"".  The DVD itself is OK as it has some decent techniques not included in the original Petrone kit.",1199577600,4,324,4.551724137931035
2460509,3,B000CEV3N2,"I like these miracle balls. They seem to help my low back. But, I don't know if they would help other parts of my body because the DVD that came with the balls only explain the one series of low back exercises. I can't even find a book by Petrone (let alone a complete DVD) that explains all the positions possible with the balls. I actually thought my DVD was damaged because it ended so abruptly and didn't get to a couple of things I thought she was going to explain. I kept going back to the menu and trying again. This was a good idea executed poorly. I guess I will keep searching for more information on how to use my new miracle balls.",1196294400,6,643,4.152
2460510,5,B000CEV3N2,"I too have read some of the other reviews and am quite surprised at the vitriol! Can't people just say that they don't like something or that they did not have success and why? Plain and detailed descriptions of both success and failure can be quite helpful and that is what I come to Amazon reviews for.

I was fortunate enough to have taken classes with Ms Petrone at a New York health club in early 2001. Every single thing she ever said in that class or the tape that I subsequently bought from her, was true and happened to me in my own body, right there in the class and at home. I do understand that there are people who can't do anything unless there is someone there pointing or touching and describing every little thing. Those people could never be satisfied with any tape, DVD or book unless it came with the instructor herself! That's why there is a whole industry built around personal training and it does not mean there is anything wrong with the Petrone Method.

I also have a very early version of the kit. Mine came with a booklet, a VHS and a cassette. If I am not mistaken, the VHS is to show the positions because she does not want you to look at the screen while you should be concentrating on the movement, with your head down.

I also understand that I have had the benefit of personal instruction, so the cassette was a reminder of what I already knew.

I am currently learning Yoga from a Book that came with a DVD and a CD: Peaceful Weight Loss Through Yoga by Brandt Bhanu Passalaccqua. The DVD is meant to show you how the movements are supposed to look and the CD has the same verbal cueing with music so that you are not looking at the screen when you should be looking at the ceiling or the mat. That method does work, but this author's DVD is really a visual representation of the illustrations in the book (which come with instructions that could be confusing if you have never seen the movement performed), and what is on the CD. He does a whole class on the DVD. Perhaps Ms. Petrone's next set could emulate this man's formula.

Ultimately though, it is important to bear in mind that no matter how great something truely is, such as Ms. Petrone's little balls, everything is not for everybody, nor every body. Temperment and learning style are as important as the quality of the product. As a personal trainer, I make lots of money explaing to others how to do things I learned mostly from books. However, I learn best from verbal instructions too.",1173657600,24,2486,4.407407407407407
2460511,4,B000CEV3N2,"I would gladly have given a five star rating if it weren't for the second DVD; it is really poor.

I have the orginal balls with the book and had difficulty using them with only still pictures and text as guidance. I ordered the version with the DVDs hoping it would provide adequate follow along instructions. The first DVD descripes the breathing and position method; it was very well put together. The second one is only Elaine's voice and no pictures. Now, that's the time I needed more. Her instructions without pictures allows too much room for error.  I had to rely on my book to work with the other parts of the body.  This DVD (for the Back, Elbow and Neck) was bad.  You can't even concentrate with only a voice going on and on.  It became fustrating and I finally turned it off.

The first DVD explains the method along with proper breathing. So the second DVD would really only need good pictures of ball placement for the other various parts of the body. It need not labor on with redundant breathing instructions.

If there is to be a second edition DVD instruction, please incorporate pictures as described above. Elaine's actual method is very beneficial.",1172534400,14,1171,4.628019323671498

Most of the visual instruction was on proper breathing and the only focus area for using the ball was the lower back.  What purpose does this serve if it only shows one application?

8098301,5,B000CEV3N2,I had a traveling overseer recommend this system to me. He suffered from chronic back pain due to a genic condition just like myself. I found it to be the most helpful advice I have had in dealing with my back. My husband and daughter have also used the system and have been amazed out how easy and successful it is. Non-evasive and the benefits are amazing! I highly recommend to everyone! DVD and balls very simple DVD helps u learn fast and to do it correctly quick and anyone can do it and have the same success!,1446422400,,516,4.275510204081633
8098302,5,B000CEV3N2,Really helped with the book set I already purchased since I learn better by seeing it.  I was expecting this to be a normal exercise DVD that I could pop in every time I wanted to do the routine. It's not. Just a preview of moves so you can get more info. The audio CD included in the video box is what I will use to help me out daily instead of trying to tead while on the balls.,1435276800,,380,3.810126582278481
