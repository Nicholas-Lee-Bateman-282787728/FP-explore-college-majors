Too much violence for children and anti gun people probably.",1362787200,,115,4.8
7949740,3,B00005Q300,"This movie isn't an A-list oscar winner, but it's worth a look for anyone whos got time on their hands and like action movies. The acting and story line could have used some work, but it's better than some things I've seen. Again, this is only for those who like mindless action and time to kill.",1099526400,,296,4.303571428571429
7949741,1,B00005Q300,"Awful....beyond terrible...
This movie was plotless, with incredibly bad acting.  I think the culmination was seeing the Delta Force insignia sewn upside down on one of the uniforms.
If you are really a die hard fan, you might like it....but don't expect realism.",1026172800,3,263,5.116279069767442
