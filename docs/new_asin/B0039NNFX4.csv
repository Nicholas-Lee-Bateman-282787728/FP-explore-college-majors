I had bought a cheaper one(MISTAKE) and you couldn't tell who was the father and who was the daughter. YUK! But this one is absolutely great. I enjoyed it so much. Thanks, Amazon, for giving us choices.",1358812800,5,347,4.4375

4096978,4,B0039NNFX4,"I loved `Father of the Bride'.  It made me cry.  Yes, I'm a softy.  Spencer Tracy makes me happy and Elizabeth Taylor was a goddess.  I can't help myself.  In all honesty, as great a film year as 1950 was, I'd place `Father of the Bride' toward the top of the pack.  It was smart, honest and witty.  Spencer Tracy should have won the Oscar and the amazing Joan Bennett should have at least been up for one!  With much anticipation, I settled in to watch the sequel, `Father's Little Dividend'.  Like my experience with the original, I had seen the 90's Steve Martin remake already and so my expectations were slightly skewed.

Where I felt that the 91' Martin vehicle actually stayed rather close to the 1950 Tracy classic, as far as story is concerned (it isn't nearly as good as the original, but it has its moments), the 1951 `Father's Little Dividend' is vastly different than `Father of the Bride, Part II'.

Instead of giving us dueling `expectant mothers', `Father's Little Dividend' focuses more on Stanley Banks' acceptance of his daughter's growing belly and his attempt to regain his youth (in a more introverted sense that Martin's antics) and his coping with his wife's emotional upheaval at the thought of her son-in-law's parents taking over everything.  While not as sharp as the original or as engaging, `Father's Little Dividend' is a respectable sequel, especially when you consider how it was basically thrown together in order to capitalize on the unexpected success of the original (it was released less than a year after the original hit theaters).  Spencer Tracy doesn't do anything new with the character, and the regurgitated `father fixes daughter's relationship' scene felt unnecessary and rather lazy, but Joan Bennett is Oscar worthy again (honestly, maybe one of the best characters created in the 50's) and the film's finale made me cry yet again.

If you loved the first, you'll really like the second.",1339372800,,1935,4.877675840978593
4096979,5,B0039NNFX4,"If you are like me and enjoy the old classics that are not chopped up on cable for the sake of commercials, which by the way remain the same throughout the whole movie, this is a must. Tracy, Taylor, Bennett are on the top of their game and you will find yourself watching it every now and then, enjoying each viewing. Buy this one, it is a true classic.",1338076800,2,354,4.144927536231884

4096981,5,B0039NNFX4,"The DigiComTV copy of ""Father's Little Dividend"" is the nicest, cleanest transfer to DVD that I have ever seen. I purchased DVD transfers from other studio sources in the past 10 years and each one was a transfer of poor quality. I decided to try once more and have been pleasantly surprised with the copy from DigiComTV. It is clear, sharp and clean. My only disappointment with the DVD is that it has no closed captions or subtitles. Otherwise, I recommend this particular DVD to anyone wishing to buy an excellent copy of this favored and treasured movie.",1303689600,13,558,4.704081632653061
4096982,5,B0039NNFX4,"This Digi Com TV version of Father's Little Dividend is immensely superior to the regular version, which was uneven and faded in and out, both color-wise and sound-wise. But I was very pleasantly surprised that this version is not choppy and uneven, it seems pretty true to the original. I would recommend this version over the regular version by far. Don't buy the regular version, you will be very disappointed.",1283558400,23,413,4.914285714285715

4096996,3,B0039NNFX4,"Way too cutesy and schmaltzy for my tastes. Spencer Tracy came through with a good performance that sustained the show. Liz Taylor had yet to develop into a weighty presence, and added little to the movie. Joan Bennett's acting was near-atrocious. Right from the first scene, where there was no reason for it, she makes an appearance with pursed lips and an air of diffused disgust. As the image of the henpecked husband offered a needed illusion to the typically oppressed movie-going housewife, this movie employed this stance as often as possible--e.g., Joan Bennett driving at excessive speed despite her husbands pleas to slow down. Not one of my favorite' 50s movies.",1471132800,,673,5.017857142857143
4096997,5,B0039NNFX4,"This is one of my favorite movies!  The sequel to Father of the Bride...this movie takes you back to the Golden Age of Hollywood.  Cast perfectly, this movie embodies all of the simplistic family values I think we all miss!  Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor bring to the screen a father and daughter chemistry that is rarely ever seen on screen.  Both movies start out as a flashback and a retrospect of a father who is loosing his only beloved daughter to marriage.  This movie delivers on so many levels and does it with smart simplistic family humor!!",1470009600,,556,4.63265306122449

4097026,4,B0039NNFX4,"The sequel to the 1950 Father of The Bride continues as Elizabeth Taylor announces her pregnancy and Spencer Tracy's character dilemna on becoming a first time grandfather. Steve Martin did a excellent protrayal in the most recent remake in Father of the Bride Part II. But in this movie, soon-to-be grandparents try to plan everything ahead of time and do not give Elizabeth Taylor a chance to make her own decisions. But she lays down the law much to the chagrin of her in-laws and her own parents. She did not even look pregnant during this movie! I had seen this movie once, but unfortunately had fallen asleep and did not receive the full enjoyment of the film. But this time I was awake and Elizabeth was a true actress in that she was suffering with her own demons because of her then husband Nicky Hilton. As stated on IMDB she had had a miscarriage as a result of Nicky Hilton kicking her in her abdomen.",1432944000,2,913,4.506024096385542

4097033,4,B0039NNFX4,"The film is a sequel to the classic 1950 film ""Father of the Bride"" with Spencer Tracy, Joan Collins, and Elizabeth Taylor. You don't necessarily need to see the previous film (I didn't), but I'm sure it helps. It's about Spencer Tracy's character George coping with his newly-married daughter have a baby, becoming a grandfather, and coming to terms with his age. It's an interesting window into the early 1950s and what it was like to have a baby in that time period. There's mild controversy about Taylor and her husband paying for a house with a mortgage, and the baby wasn't even named until the Christening! There's some funny hijinks courtesy of Tracy, and the film goes into some dramatic territory at times. It's a little on the dry side, but it's still a fun, charming, harmless little film overall.

The quality was fine for the Amazon Instant Video stream. It's not great, but it's certainly watchable. I could still understand what was going on and hear the dialogue.",1424390400,,980,4.764705882352941
4097034,5,B0039NNFX4,"I loved this movie! Lots of laughs. It seems it only has 3 star rating because of the quality of the film, but it's an old movie so I don't expect 2015 quality. The storyline is way better than any of the garbage that's put out today.",1423699200,,234,4.0
4097035,5,B0039NNFX4,"I don't know how MGM (Must've Gone Mad) ever allowed this gem to fall into public domain.

This version by DigiComTV is the best transfer I've seen. I was even able to read the opening credits (I kid you not; the titles on the previous version I had were totally illegible).

4097045,3,B0039NNFX4,"The cast and crew returned to make this sequel when it became clear the first film was a big hit.  In their haste to cash in, this ""addition"" to the story is a bit slapdash.  They reuse the same setup as the first film, having Spencer Tracy sitting in a chair opining to the audience about the news of his cherished daughter Kay having a baby.  Instead of treating the news with great joy, as does his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett), Stanley (Tracy) turns into a grumpy old fart, angry because this means he's now a grandpa.  He spends the bulk of this short film (82 minutes) crabby and resentful, worse, he soon turns his animosity on his grandson, at one point Stanley carelessly loses him by the side of the road while he's off playing with a bunch of kids!

This film definitely has less appeal than the first one.  There's an overwhelming sense of desperation throughout, as though they were trying too hard to match the fun of the original, everything feels forced.  The fact that they allowed their copyright to lapse, forcing this film into the arena of public domain, says a lot.  If they considered it as  important as the original film, they wouldn't have tossed it away so casually.",1397865600,,1190,4.5233644859813085

DigicomTv has done a remarkable, amazing job in remastering this wonderful classic! Audio and video quality are superb! The best I've ever seen!

Wonderful, heartwarming story with the quintessential Spencer Tracy at his best! Tracy has plans for his life now that his three children are grown and he has money in the bank, and no mortgage on the house. But, fate has other plans for his new found freedom - he's about to become a grandfather.

Tracy struggles with the idea that his life is about to change when Kay, his beloved daughter, played beautifully by Elizabeth Taylor, becomes pregnant. Tracy doesn't really want to become a grandfather, he would rather travel the world with his lovely wife, but he accepts the idea that the role of grandfather is his whether he wants it or not.

One spring day, Tracy is left to babysit the new baby and takes him out to the park for an outing. Tracy gets distracted with a group of boys playing soccer, and leaves the baby alone in his carriage without supervision. When Tracy finally returns to the carriage, the carriage and baby are missing. Tracy panics, looking everywhere for his grandson. He finally makes his way to the police station to report the missing child, and finds out that they have recovered the baby from the park. Tracy begs them not to phone his daughter, but instead promises the police this kind of thing will never happen again! Tracy returns home with the baby, and at the christening for the child, Tracy discovers that his grandchild has been named after him, he is ecstatic! Grandfather and grandson become inseparable afterwards - grandfather and grandson living happily ever after!!

4097055,5,B0039NNFX4,"Before buying this movie for my mom I was going to purchase the cheaper DVD version until I read all of the negative feedback regarding the picture and sound quality. I was a little relieved when I then came upon this version of the movie made by digicom. I then read all the great reviews given by people who paid a little more money and received the better quality picture and sound. Needless to say I decided on buying this DVD from this company. Boy was I surprised when I put the DVD in the player for my mom. The picture quality was crystal clear, sound was perfect. Bottom line is, is you will definitely not be sorry buying from this company, spend the few bucks more and enjoy this movie. I'm glad I made my mom happy. Thank you to all the reviewers for this version as well as the cheaper version, I was glad that all of your reviews led me to buying the better DVD.",1377561600,3,876,4.220238095238095

The stars shine (Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett and Elizabeth Taylor) but the story and characterization is not up to the first movie.

8392121,4,B0039NNFX4,"Review of Father's Little Dividend
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

Its not necessary to watch Father of the Bride first, since the very title gives away the plot, but if you like classic movies, feel free to watch it before diving into the sequel, Fathers Little Dividend.

The entire cast returns, giving a repeat performance worthy of Edward Streeters original characters, from the silliest obstacles to Spencer Tracys narration. If ever there was a grumpy actor who could pull of hostility towards impending grandfather-hood, it was Mr. Baked Potato himself, Spencer Tracy. Im not a fan of Spence, but he really is perfectly grumpy in these movies, just as the character warrants.

In this one, Elizabeth Taylors expecting a baby. Father isn't looking forward to the little critter taking over everyones lives, and he tries to combat everyone elses excitement every step of the way. I love these movies; they're so hilariously true to life even now, even though there are dated Honey Im home elements sprinkled along the way. Both Father movies are funny and delightful; pick them up for an old movie marathon over the weekend!

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, theres one scene in this movie that might be not your friend. Father and daughter sit on a bench swing and talk, and it might make you sick. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1500422400,,1360,4.824034334763948

8392123,5,B0039NNFX4,"Good family fun.  The cast is great, Spencer Tracy is at his best; they just don't grow stars like him very easily.  Ryan Reynolds has a similar aura.

Seeing Elizabeth Taylor so young and innocent as a new mother is a treat.

All around, this is a great film that lifts your spirits and reminds you to listen to the birds singing or children playing outside.  Enjoy the moment.",1487203200,,378,4.420289855072464
