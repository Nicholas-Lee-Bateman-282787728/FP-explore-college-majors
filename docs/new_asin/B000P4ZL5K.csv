2810189,1,B000P4ZL5K,"totally disappointing - series 1 was fantastic, but the second season only focuses on violence... no humor, even the dialogues are boring... complete waste of money and time...",1455321600,8,176,5.321428571428571
2810190,4,B000P4ZL5K,"This season is a high-octane ride from beginning to.. well.. almost the end.  The writing and acting is so tight, so wrought with suspense and ingenuity until about the eighth or ninth episode at which point it kind of loses some impetus.. largely due to script writing that seems somewhat bent on coming to a conclusion, rather than being logical for the characters.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of long final shootout scenes, having seen a billion already, or maybe I didn't completely buy that the Indian goes completely haywire.. it just didn't seem quite up to par with script-writing in the first half.  Actually there were so many great characters in the season.. the main policeman was great, Dodd was great.  The husband and wife were great but just seemed better realized in first 3 quarters of the series.  The Indian's character was fearsome - - and excellent - - he too seemed better realized earlier on as opposed to towards the ending which largely rotates around his sudden change of heart.  I realize there's a black comic edge to all this but even with that, the first 3 quarters of the show are stronger than all the blazing guns in the finale.  Anyway, still some great scenes as well as profound treatises on the meaning of life.  Oh, also a killer soundtrack- - well, set in the 70s of course it's gonna have great music.  Loved the costumes cars and characters.  I give it a 4.5.  It wasn't perfect, but it was almost there..",1454716800,4,1445,4.583657587548638
2810191,5,B000P4ZL5K,"1979. There is a war brewing between a drugs gang based in Kansas City and an operation run by the Gerhardt family in Fargo, North Dakota. The conflict unexpectedly spirals out of control after an innocent couple, Peggy Blumquist and her butcher husband Ed, accidentally kill one of the Gerhardt sons. The conflict escalates, with Minnesota State Trooper Lou Solverson left to investigate and find those responsible.

When FX announced they were making a TV series based on the 1996 movie Fargo by the Coen Brothers, a lot of people including the Coen Brothers thought they were insane. Instead, the first season of Fargo turned out to be, quite possibly, the greatest individual season of television since (at least) the fourth season of The Wire aired a decade ago. The bar was raised impossibly high for a second season.

Fortunately, writer/producer Noah Hawley had a trick up his sleeve. Fargo is, at least nominally, an anthology series where each season has its own cast and self-contained story. The seasons all take place in the same fictional universe (as each other and the film) so references and very occasional characters cross over, but overall each season stands alone as its own story. And throughout the first season, the character of Lou Solverson (Keith Carradine) makes oblique references to something horrendous that happened in Sioux Falls in 1979. Season 2 tells us that story.

That tale is nothing less than a war story, a clash for territory and control between the Kansas City Mob and the Gerhardt family based in Fargo, North Dakota. The situation escalates into all-out war when one of the sons of the Gerhardt family is inadvertently killed by Peggy and Ed Blumquist (Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons), a quiet, ordinary couple trying to live the American Dream in their own way. Ed is soon mistaken as a ruthless, murderous contract killer (""The Butcher"") by both the Gerhardts and the Kansas City boys, with local law enforcement officers Hank Larsson (Ted Danson) and Lou Solverson (Patrick Wilson) having to try to protect the hapless couple.

That's not really the whole story. There's also Lou's home issues, with his wife Betsy (Cristin Milioti) suffering from cancer. There's the murderous gun-for-hire Mike Milligan (Bokeem Woodbine) who works for the Kansas City crew but finds his career prospects hampered by racial prejudice. And there's a very enigmatic Native American Hanzee Dent (Zahn McClarnon) who works for the Gerhardt family as an enforcer...up to a point. And that's not even mentioning the misadventures of local drunk lawyer Karl Weathers (Nick Offerman) and the fact that Ronald Reagan (Bruce Campbell) is hitting the campaign trail in the state int he midst of the chaos.

The second season of Fargo is busier than the first and, it has to be said, is not quite as good. However, it's still probably the single finest season of television you'll see this year. The second season is a little more diffuse, less focused and less finely-characterised than the first season. We don't have quite as finely-tuned a clash of personalities as the three-way battle of wits between Lorne Malvo, Lester Nygaard and Molly Solverson in the first season. But it's damn close. The second season feels a bit more inclined to pursue random tangents for the sake of character or even just a laugh (whoever cast Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan needs to be given a raise, immediately) before pulling itself together in the last few episodes to deliver the promised carnage at Sioux Falls and it delivers that with aplomb.

Plaudits can be poured onto the series freely. Kirsten Dunst and Ted Danson are two very familiar faces from American film and television, but here give career-best performances. Dunst plays Peggy as a somewhat self-obsessed (if not blinkered) housewife in a marriage to someone who doesn't entirely suit her, but then is unexpectedly able to capitalise on the carnage to help her ""self-actualise"" (to borrow her self-help guru's terminology), although fortunately not in as quite an evil direction as Lester in the first season. It's a tricky character to nail but Dunst does so with impressive skill. Danson also does excellent work as the sheriff trying to keep a lid on the chaos that is threatening to blow up in his town. In fact, all of the actors put in incredibly strong turns with Patrick Wilson being totally convincing as the younger version of Keith Carradine's character from the first season and Nick Offerman delivering a dramatic, powerful performance that shows his much greater range than just playing comedy, as he has done recently (although his drunk lawyer character does provide a few laughs as well).

Complaints? Well, the pacing is a bit odd. The central story is surprisingly thin, and unlike the first season this one feels like it could have had a few episodes shaved off it...until you get to the final three or four episodes which come after that peak and realise the genius of the writers in how they've structured the season. So that complaint is pretty quickly dispensed with. As mentioned above the show is a bit more willing to explore tangential subplots this year, but most of those subplots are excellent in their own right, so that's not really an issue either. Something that has sharply divided viewers is the emergence of science fictional elements in the story, which twice (in the first and ninth episodes) play a decisive role in events. My guess is that isn't really an SF element at all and is a result of the writers planting story seeds for future seasons, but in the context of this year by itself feels very random, although it does play into the 1970s theme quite well.

But it's still a gripping, intelligent and beautifully-written season of television, with an even larger hint of the weird about it. The series will be released on 23 February on DVD in the United States and on 25 April (because it takes two months to cross the Atlantic in 2016, clearly) in the UK. The show will be released on Blu-Ray as well but these editions have not yet been listed.",1454457600,32,6074,4.901750972762646

2810194,5,B000P4ZL5K,"Season two was even better than the first imo.  And I absolutely loved season one.  It was worth the wait.  I loved the subtle connection to season one.  The casting was spot on.  Kirsten Dunst's, Peggy Blumquist, was a pleasant surprise.  Her character became more endearing with each episode.  She was quite funny.  I looked forward to the scenes with her and her husband, Ed. The Blumquists made a mountain out of a molehill when hiding an at-first legitimate accident puts them smack in the middle of a mafia war between the Gerhardt family and Kansas City.  And now they also have unnecessary trouble with the police, headed by Patrick Wison's, Lou Solverson.  But their unbelievable luck is what made the season so entertaining.  Just all-around incredible story-telling.  Do yourself a favor and watch!",1452211200,6,809,4.955223880597015
2810195,5,B000P4ZL5K,"I really did not know what I would think of  the going back in time story but this season was fabulous. Season 1 was SO great I did not know how they could repeat that but they did so staying true to the Fargoesque humor thrown into perilous & gruesome circumstances.

The movie Fargo is still one of my all time favorites and I am so glad they decided to do a series and do it well. Jessie Plemmons and Kirsten Dunst were perfect at their roles and it was hard not to laugh at them at the same time you are horrified at the things they do so matter of factly  The entire cast was superb. Outstanding casting and I really  loved the  woman who played Molly's mother even though she was one of the least dramatic people this time around.  She was just as tough as some of the crazies this season with her inner strength and grin and bear it approach to her illness.",1451779200,23,864,4.1437125748503

2810197,5,B000P4ZL5K,"I don't mind buying TV shows on DVD.
What I do mind is buying Season 1 on Blu-Ray and then not having a Blu-Ray release for Season 2.
""The Americans"" also did this.

UPDATE: July 27 2016
While this season did add Blu-ray to the available formats, the price difference is substantial.
The DVD is still more than I paid for the Blu-ray of Season 1. I hate having mixed sets, so I'm waiting and waiting and waiting for the Blu-ray price to drop.
But I will add back a star on faith that the actual show, which I haven't seen yet,  lives up to the expectations created by the first season.

UPDATE: Jan 2 2017
I finally bought the Blu-ray on Sep 11 2016 for $19.99, which was a long wait for a show that finished Dec 14 2015. But I was not disappointed in the show. 5 stars.",1451001600,9,770,4.12

2810199,5,B000P4ZL5K,"Each season is different. Each season has a beginning, middle and end. This series knows what it wants to be and does it well. Very entertaining. It's right up there with other great crime shows like Breaking Bad, The Wire, and Sons of Anarchy.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. Westworld and Outlander are a couple of my current favorites.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1669,5.482490272373541

Was a bit let down since they switched up how they did the show. Instead of starting the show like normal, they started an episode or two by opening a book, and ended up pausing the show, rewinding it, and having a narrator. I personally feel it took away from the suspense of the show and hope it was an experimental thing since they didn't do it for all the episodes.",1488844800,,527,4.3232323232323235

2810285,5,B000P4ZL5K,"FXs award winning Fargos second season continues with its signature blend of taking plain folks and through an unfortunate twist of fate embroiling them in murder and mayhem.  Sure, much of it is just absurd and since its a Coen Brothers franchise there are bizarre elements like repeated visits of UFOs and Gov. Ronald Reagan campaigning for president that seem irrelevant.  But, who cares since the sum of all the seemingly discordant parts is great entertainment.  An incredible cast of A-list stars who embrace their parts completely sell the story.

  You can read plot summaries elsewhere so in brief, in 1979 Fargo, ND the Gerhardt family business is organized crime operating from their fortified ancestral farm.  Youngest son, Rye (Kieran Culkin) trying to facilitate a deal with a local typewriter shop owner attempts to strong arm a judges decision regarding a back tax issue.  His efforts catastrophically fail resulting in multiple homicides and his own demise and involving the innocent Blumquist family.  Concurrently the Kansas City mob takes this opportunity to launch a hostile takeover of the Gerhardt syndicate and all hell breaks loose to put it mildly.  The writing is top-shelf and the story and dialog will demand your attention every episode.

  Kirsten Dunst is definitely getting better with age.  Not everyone can pull off a Farrah Fawcett hairstyle and a pretty horrible late 70s wardrobe and look good doing it.  Her delusional hairdresser and hoarder Peggy Blumquist clearly is unhappy with her life and schlubby spouse Ed the butcher (Jesse Plemons also superb as a man whos helpless in a battle of wits with his witless wife) and hopes a self actualization seminar for women will make her the best me she can be.  Events conspire against her however in horrific Fargo style.  Dunst is excellent and her attempts to rationalize her actions in a later scene opposite Ted Danson (Sheriff Hank Larsson) are enthralling.  Danson is amazing as well (as usual) and the incredulity on his face listening to this woman he thinks he knows is priceless.

  As mentioned, this cast is so good; Jean Smart as the Gerhardt family matriarch is marvelous in her subtle portrayal of a criminal enterprise leader whos not to be trifled with.  Its hard to believe this is the same person who was sweet Charlene on Designing Women but she looks like a sinister version of my grandmother.  Nick Offerman who Ive been a fan of since Parks & Recreation, plays the best (and only) lawyer in town and makes the most of a secondary role chewing the scenery whenever hes on screen.  Likewise, Zahn McClarnon who portrays the lethal Native American Gerhardt henchman Hanzee is short on dialog but long on action delivers a strong performance.  Id be remiss not mentioning Patrick Wilson who plays State Trooper Lou Solverson, the younger version of Keith Carradines diner owning father of Officer Molly Solverson from Season 1.  His task is quite a challenge in imagining what this much younger version of Lou should be without doing a Carradine impression and he pulls it off admirably.

  And theres more; Burn Notice fans rejoice; this season gives us not only Jeffery Donovan as the Gerhardts eldest son Dodd but Bruce Campbell in a surprisingly restrained turn as none other than Ronald Reagan.  From watching the bonus features its impressive how much energy Campbell put into his characterization of the late president for what amounts to a fairly small role.  Personally I didn't see the point of including Reagan in the story but have to admit that Campbell made his appearance a treat.  Donovan deserves credit for taking on a role thats a far cry from the suave, super spy he made famous on seven seasons of Burn Notice and as Dodd hes both menacing and at times amusing.  Wikipedia reports he gained 30# transforming for the part and had to suffer a laughable hairstyle and worse wardrobe.  No Oliver Peoples $450 sunglasses with this guy.

  The last 20 minutes or so aren't all that exciting and something of a letdown but do wrap up a few loose ends.  The Kansas City mobster dispatched to take out the Gerhardts, Mike Milligan (Bokeem Woodbine) winds up getting a promotion for his hard work reminiscent of the same fate suffered by Vic Mackey in The Shield.  His reaction to getting a tiny office in an corporate building instead of something more exciting is funny and a fitting outcome for him.

  The look and feel of the show captures the era with the kind of precision youd see in Mad Men.  I was in college in 1979 and vividly remember the cars and clothes.  On occasion a bit of anachronistic language creeps in (Dont over think it for example) but its very rare.  One thing Im conflicted about with this season is the music; it seems they're trying too hard to be clever and campy with many of the selections.  Rather than accent the on-screen action in some cases its just distracting.  I also felt the whole UFO thing was just unnecessary and an attempt to burnish the series quirky cred, almost like a device youd expect from Twin Peaks.  Small complaints Ill admit and they don't diminish my recommending this series highly.  Theres a bit of bad language and of course plenty of bloodshed so beware if you're easily offended by those elements.",1487721600,5,5277,4.8359375

A prequel to the events in its first season,(2006) season two of Fargo takes place in 1979 Both seasons which are related but independent stories are so quirky you simply can't draw your eyes away. All the cast are superb but Kirsten Dunst is spectacular as Peggy. Great DVD to binge watch on a cold winter weekend",1486857600,,371,4.470588235294118
2810289,4,B000P4ZL5K,"Terrific show.  My only criticism was with the casting:  As a fan of Burn Notice, watching that shows lead playing the hick crime-lord part he played in this series, just came off as way too put-on.  But maybe viewers who never saw Burn Notice, might feel differently.  It was enjoyable none-the-less.  Not that it didn't make for great television, nor even to say I disagree with their approach, as it was an effective vehicle for setting the tone of the series, but I was a little disappointed to learn, despite the show opening each and every episode with how it's a true story, that it's apparently almost, if not completely fictitious.  I guess that should have been obvious after the first ""sighting"", maybe after the first season, but anyway...

Still highly entertaining and definitely worth seeing more than once.  And of course there's no better way to watch than Blu-ray aside from UHD disc, but the I wouldn't cross my fingers on that happening, when Fox has been pulling physical media support for their series left and right.",1486684800,,1039,4.797752808988764

Season 2 is set in early 1979.  I graduated from a Wisconsin high school in 1970. S2 has many good aspects and compelling characters.  It started strong, but then runs out of winter.

Yes--the UFO appearances jumped the shark.  Ronald Reagan is portrayed as a cartoon character and one who is shown campaigning 9 months before he announced his candidacy.  No 1979 VP Fritz Mondale who is from Minn.  The last episodes often became disjointed and uneven.  Alberta is not always a good stand in for Minn. and the eastern part of the Dakotas.

Jeffery Donovan is fabulous as Dodd Gerhardt and Jesse Plemons is excellent as Ed. Of course the main stars (Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson, Patrick Wilson) are great, but it's the supporting characters that really make the show. I bought season 2 after watching season 1 but didn't watch it for a while...it just sat on the watch list. Once started it was a total binge watch.

There are only so many possible organized crime stories, so it's all of the small details that matter.  Every episode puts pregnant pauses between the sentences and the actions that really allow you to soak it all in.

2810387,3,B000P4ZL5K,"As a prequel to Season 1 it's interesting to learn Keith Carradine's character (Lou Solverson) backstory. Although this season is just as entertaining in many parts, I thought inserting actual UFOs (I kid you not) into central parts of the plot really were a ""jump the shark"" moment.
Also. I really did not get how the dopey Gerhardt family even got remotely powerful as a crime family because they all seem dumber than boxes of rocks. What was up with Dodd Gerhardt channeling a cross between Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters and Bill ""you have to think like a gopher"" Murray's voice patterns from Caddyshack?

Plus although Kirsten Dunst gave a pretty good performance as a total dunce, I just felt that her and Landry (Jesse Plemons) from ""Friday Night Lights"" has far too many horseshoes of luck throughout in avoiding death.

Like Season 1 we get a some more comic actors playing serious roles which works out well especially Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) with a beard and no 'stache from ""Parks & Rec"" as a smooth talking lawyer. Kudos to Bokeem Woodbine playing the very cool philosophizing dude Mike Milligan from the Kansas City mob. He's a talent to be watched as are his sideburns if the late '70s ever come back.

The extras are excellent with a couple of the early discs of a fake ad for Skip's typewriter shop and a commentary track by fake Ronald Reagan talking about his ""motion pictures."" The last disc has a 44-minute extra on the two major shootout scenes, a discussion on the central cop character of Lou with older Lou (Keith Carradine) and younger Lou (Patrick Wilson, who was terrific and is the breakout star of Fargo 2) and a short three-minute spot about Martin Freeman from Season 1 returning to do narration in one of the latter episodes.",1467072000,2,1760,4.707792207792208

A daring move setting it in the 1970s and revolving around a war between a mafia family and an innocent couple. The characters and story haven't stuck with me quite the way Season 1 is but I think it's probably unfair to compare it to Season 1. Season 1 was lightning in a bottle that can unlikely ever be touched.

Has a completely difference cast of characters although some are actually younger versions of ones who appeared in Season 1 (although I didn't notice this while watching, but it is explained in the special features).  This is a good crime world power struggle fight to the death tale done in the offbeat dark humour style of the Fargo movie and first season.  Throw in a butcher and his not the brightest wife who runs down an armed murderer and then just drives home with his corpse in the windshield.  Unfortunately for them the murderer is the son/grandson of a North Dakota cartel family.

The second last episode without spoiling it for you has a completely unexpected scene that you won't see coming.  A great second season, you don't need to have seen the movie or the first season to watch these ten episodes but there are a few references and homages.  There is even a homage to the wood chipper scene from the movie.",1465603200,,982,4.609195402298851

The cast is just fantastic (Wilson, Pelmons, Dunst, Woodbine, Donovan to name a few).  The cast director deserves an Emmy award. The music is good.

Fargo 2 is literally (especially episode 8) hilarious.

Fargo 2 reminded me of the early Coen brother films when they started out with a unique style (Raising Arizona, Blood Simple).

I didn't feel the connection to the characters as before, with the exception of maybe Lou and his family. Trying to make Reagan look like a dunce was predictable, but disappointing. Carter would have been more appropriate given the time frame, but we can't do that now can we? Otherwise, it was a viewable experience.

I mean, the personality of that actor is nothing like, if you know the smallest bit about personality types.  In Fargo the movie and Fargo Season 1, whoever made those liked and respected the (non-evil or stupid) characters.  Season 2 characters are not as endearing and the humor is missing.  The men are  either evil or stupid, or both.  And even more stilted accents and conversations.  So, what's to like?  Ummmm . . . I'm thinking.

2810415,3,B000P4ZL5K,"Ok first and foremost, The original movie Fargo was superb. Season 1 superb as well....Now to be honest, I was expecting a bit more. Though season 3 is good, it didn't hit the mark like season 1. some of the episodes were really good, some missed the mark as opposed to season 1 where, every episode hit the mark. I just thought that as long as it took to film and release season 2, I was let down somewhat.

I hear season 3 has been approved for filming and release, I just hope it helps this series get back to hitting the high mark because if it doesn't, well this series won't last much longer.

The most disappointment of season 2 IMHO...I could not connect and like most of the characters, and throw in a somewhat mediocre ending and what do you have...a ok series...if this series is to last for some time, then season 3 needs to restore to this series the magic season 1 left us with.",1463011200,,892,4.272189349112426

The acting spot on the writing and direction and excellent and I am never bored with it. Now over all I think it is just as good as season 1 but I do want to point out a few things I did not think  the opening episode or final episode was as good as the same 2 for season one and I didn't think season 2 quite had a villain like billy bob Thorton, however the episodes in between most definitely make up for this. In comparison season one had some weaker but still great episodes like episode 2 and 3. Also the large amount of villains in this season like Han and the  Gerharts and more help out for there not being a single definitive villain like malvo (of course Lester was a villain too though). Anyway if you like breaking bad (not that this is that similar to that) you should try out this show both seasons,  it needs more fans. Forgot to mention every season is a new cast and is completely different it's considered in the award shows a mini series, I would classify it as a reoccurring mini series though. Also season 1 and 2 and probably future seasons are all connected in many ways  . The biggest way is that Lou a minor character in season 1 is a major character in season 2.

2810471,5,B000P4ZL5K,"The second season of Fargo is a stellar follow up to the first, despite the lack of star power that the first season had.  The most recognizable actors this season are Kirsten Dunst, Jean Smart and Ted Danson.  And realistically to the extent any of them were A list stars, they are well past that point now.  The season is essentially a flash back to the events of 1979 that were referenced in Season 1.  A younger Lou Solverson (this time played by Patrick Wilson) is the main character.  He is a Minnesota State Trooper that is caught in the middle of a mob war that begins with a murder and then a hit and run accident.  Also of note are guest appearances by Bruce Campbell playing a campaigning Ronald Regan and Nick Offerman playing the town lawyer.  Offerman appears in a few different episodes, and has a couple really great scenes in one of them.

Unlike the first season there is no direct tie in to the movie plot.  There are a couple scenes that pay homage to the movie, one that was akin to the wood chipper scene in the movie, and one where Jerry cannot open his car door and just beats on his car for about a minute.  The show is very violent, much more so than even season one.  There is pretty much a scene like the elevator scene toward the end of season one in every episode.  There is some sex and nudity, but it is pretty much contained to one episode, and a lot of swearing.  So if any of that will turn you off to the show then it is best to skip it.

For those who get the actual discs, the show looks and sounds great on blu ray.  The set is fairly light on the extras.  There is an 8 min ""commentary"" where Bruce Campbell, playing Ronald Regan does commentary on a couple of the clips of Regan's movies that play during the show.  On the last disc there is a 45 min making of feature, a 15 min chat with the series creator and Patrick Wilson and Keith Caradine (separately) discussing their take on the character Lou, and then a short feature on the book that they created for the series, True Crimes of the Midwest.  Good for what is there, but it would have been even better if there were commentary tracks for at least some of the episodes.",1458345600,25,2169,4.236009732360097

Now we are in episode 8 of Season 2, and I must say that not only is it equal to Season 1--it may actually be better! There's definitely more action, something my 74-year-old Dad appreciates.

Loved the first season (and the original movie as well).
The second season just seemed to be mean.
There was violence in the first season but there was humor as well.
The writers seemed to have lost their sense of humor.
There is also a lot of good original and cover music out there in the world--one didn't need to re-here songs from previous Coen Brothers movies. (Brother, where art thou and The Big Lebowski) even though covered by other artists than those in the films mentioned.
It was nice to see the father/daughter relationship that was shown (many years later) in season one.
The beginning of that relationship in season two was nice.
And Patrick Wilson and Ted Danson stood out, for me, as the representations of humanity in the series.
But that's about it.",1457395200,,783,4.7226277372262775

However, if you are having trouble falling asleep watch this - every episode, except the first one, put me to sleep; some episodes put me to sleep many times!

2810486,1,B000P4ZL5K,"My impression of FX is that they don't interfere with the production but once the product is done they try to recoup their money as quickly as possible as if the product was a spoiling tomato.  e.g. they put the dvd out right away with little work on the details, while hbo waits for months or years and puts out a dvd or bluray up to the same standards as the show.  This is a great show so it's disappointing to see it treated like a rotten tomato.
Anyway, I'm very disappointed with the dvd.  There's no commentary or special features and this show in particular needs some explanation filler.  Also, there's some amazing cinematography (best in the biz) and I'd pay good money just to know how they did some scenes like the elevator scene.  I disagree with FX.  I think there is a fan base out there to support the minimal amount of work it would take to create a sellable product.  If they can do it with 'nurse jackie', FX can do it with their quality shows like this.",1456876800,7,974,4.318681318681318

Fargo, on the other hand, took it's time introducing characters, telling the story and the great cinematography reminiscent of TD's first session. Fargo's second season had the action, was thought provoking, and the thrills the second season of True Detective should have had.

2810497,5,B000P4ZL5K,"What a season! From the seasons pilot which finds our main protagonists getting themselves in way over they heads to the the end of the episode introducing our Kansas City mob and in it, Mike Milligan. I knew after the first 60 minutes that I was gonna love this season. Patrick Wilson killed it as Lou Solverson, a character depicted in season 1 by Keith Carridine. He has a scene in the end of episode 4 where he talks to Kristen Dunst and Jesse Plemins about having the look..., if you watched it you know what I mean. He should win best actor for that scene alone. The Gerhardts, Hanzee, and of course Nick Offerman's Karl Weathers were mezmerizing, I felt like every scene in this show was gold, these actors must have just dove right in and gave it their all. There were never any dull moments, unimportant story arcs or pointless scenes. The first 9 episodes are perfect in which a war is coming to a quite little town and you see how these people are affected by it. It's a bloodbath mixed with humor and heart..., and maybe little green men. As Peggy says though,"" it's just a flyin' saucer."" And for those who acted like this was just too weird, well they must have forgotten about the fish falling from the sky in season 1. It's Fargo what do you want? Then came the finale and after all the craziness from the past episodes the show ends with a subtle closing, some characters make it, others don't. Mike Milligan after everything he does is rewarded with his own personal hell, one that only Vic Mackie from the Shield would understand. A desk job I guess is better then others fates in this amazing show.
