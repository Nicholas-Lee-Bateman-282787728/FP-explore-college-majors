8210227,5,6303113443,"Writer/narrator Michael Wood's Art of the Western World is a landmark educational series and really ought to be made available on DVD. This episode in particular, which surveys the rise of early 20th-Century arts movements against the political backdrop of the times, is particularly poignant and relevant. The production values are not terribly slick, but the writing is honest, straightforward and informative, and many wonderful works of art are featured. I don't know who is holding up the DVD rights to this series, whether it is a co-producer or whomever. Art of the Western World really needs to be issued on DVD asap.",1211414400,2,625,5.077669902912621
