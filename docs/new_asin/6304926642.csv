7880993,5,6304926642,"Originally shown on American Movie Classics, when they actually showed Classic Movies, this is one enjoyable Documentary on Movie Monsters. Spanning the genre's growth from the silents in the teens, through Lon Chaney, Universal Horror, the 1950s, Hammer Horrors, Vincent Price and into the Gore age. The emphasis is always on the Monsters and there endurance through all of this.
Packed with lots of rare clips and hosted by the great Jack Palance, this is a wonderful way to expand your Horror knowledge or kill some time during Halloween.
Alot of fun.",1239321600,,554,5.032608695652174
7880994,5,6304926642,"This is a very interesting, and entertaining video on the history, etc. of the horror film including Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolfman, The Mummy, etc. It shows our favorite classic characters, and films, and our favorite  new creatrures, characters, and films. Jack Palance is the host of the  video. He describes the history and the evolution of the horror film, and  our favorite monsters, including merchandising of them etc. Great music,  and tone to the show! Very entertaining for the whole family! Well, it  might not be for young kids, but then again, they might enjoy it. Parents  should watch first, then decide. I recommend this tape to any monster,  horror, or science-fiction fan! Great stuff!",942969600,,708,5.104347826086957
