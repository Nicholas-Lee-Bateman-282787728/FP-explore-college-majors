The Prologue with sence that dancers moving under the water, for my opinion is really an innovation. It is actually appears beautiful (even though it may rate 'PG'). I felt it is even more beautiful the motions of dancers in water than on the stage. Probably because all the gestures are more 'linger' and 'melodical'.
The plot of this opera takes less interests of me due to I am three houndres years away from it was written and lack of the knowlege of that period.
For sure, this is a very 'morden' product. It may not satisfying you if you are prefering more tranditional sets. But, I sure fell the 'trying of different' in this product. And, I don't think it is too bad.
p.s. If you are fan of ballet and other dances, this may just suits you better.",1279324800,2,873,4.395061728395062
8375130,1,B001AE4PB0,"I ordered it, I looked forward to it, and I watched it with increasing irritation and occasional boredom.  Then I checked out the on-line reviews, and, yes, ""irritating"" seems a common response.

Lovers of the opera will hate it.  Though the voices are (for the most part) very fine indeed, the production will make the opera-buffs heckles rise.

Lovers of contemporary dance will be annoyed and bored.  The dance sequences are naive.  Too often there is a sense of ""look what I can do"".  It's athletic, not especially attractive, and often brainless.  Elaborate choreographic ideas (frequently involving complex bits of set or props) are introduced, taking quite some time to be set up, only to be abandoned almost immediately - and for no apparent intent or effect.  Conversely, some ideas are reiterated endlessly, long over-staying their welcome.

The ""acting"" is frequently appaling.  And yet again we are reminded that, as a general rule, dancers should be discouraged from speaking.  The costuming is dull (except for one scene involving a welter of ridiculous party-outfits, absurdly used).  The set is wonderful.

Oh!  And of course there is the famous (and famously irrelevant and incomprehensible prologue).  It's pretty.  At first.  It goes absolutely no-where.",1233014400,12,1273,5.248756218905473
