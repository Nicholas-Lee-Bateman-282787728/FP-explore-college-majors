8324508,5,1943093296,"This was a fantastic documentary on Joseph Smith. I found the research, quotes and background to be priceless to have for ones own learning. The way in which the research was presented was touching. After the movie was over, we just sat there unable to move as I pondered more his life and mission.  For people who know very little of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I would encourage you to view this. If you gain nothing else but some understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I would encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. This is a must see.",1515283200,,620,4.43859649122807
