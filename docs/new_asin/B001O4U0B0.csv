8329678,5,B001O4U0B0,"Had ordered the complete set and was engrossed in the series till we found the third disc was broken. Instead of going through the process of reporting and refund, I ordered this replacement disc from 'troyacurtis71'. He was on top of it all the way, has a phone number to call which i rang up but didn't leave a message when it went to recording but he called me back anyway!...shipped fast and the replacement was exactly what we needed. I would order from this vendor again for sure. The series is a must have for any war buff. The best and most complete documentary ever.",1403654400,,575,4.433962264150943
