650879,5,630343102X,"I am afraid that my review of ""The Tanks are coming"" will have to be brief as I saw the film way back in the 1950s. I have always had a great interest in things military - tanks especially. Many films have been  made on the subject of tanks in war since then, but ""The Tanks are  Coming"" still sticks in my mind as the film that so accurately  presented the military problems that the allied armies of the time  encountered when they were struugling against a brave, determined and  well-equipped adversary.

651211,5,630343102X,"Shows the importance of engineering and design in winning a war.

When America entered the ground war in France after D-Day, the Germans were using the Tiger II with a 75 mm howitzer to fire high explosive fragmentation shells.  Its powerful gun and very heavy armor made it superior to every Allied or Soviet tank.  The American tankers would report their close range, direct hits, were ""bouncing off"" the German tanks.  This accurate fact of World War II is dramatized a couple of times in this good movie.

The US M4 tank was the equal of the German medium tank.  The M4, although reliable and easy to maintain, was already outgunned by the time the US encountered the Germans in France.  While it is commonly believed that the Sherman had a tendency to explode catastrophically due to their use of petrol fuel, this is incorrect.  The US Sherman tank suffered from thin armor and poor ammunition storage.

The Sherman gained grim nicknames such as ""Tommycooker"" from the Germans, who called British soldiers ""Tommies""  Finally, in the fall of 1944 US tankers were getting better tanks, (the M36) with a 90 mm gun.  The M36 was well liked by its crews, being one of the few armored fighting vehicles available to US forces that could destroy heavy German tanks from a distance.  The M36 first served in combat in Europe in September 1944, until the end of the war.

Today, the importance of superior fighting equipment is not lost on the Chinese or Russians.  This is why they are quick to copy American designs.  In many cases, as opposed to doing their own development.

In addition to the horrors of war, it must've been incredibly frustrating for tankers to maneuver and make good shots only to see their shells bounce off the German tanks.

This movie is well acted and has a good human interest story.  Unlike the movie, ""Battle of the Bulge"", locations utilized for this movie seem reasonably authentic and convincing.",1432684800,,1928,4.756024096385542
651212,4,630343102X,"OK, it is corny but it is still very enjoyable.  I watched this movie on TV in the 60's and every time I saw it in TV GuideI couldn't wait for it to come on. I did a lot of WWII miniature wargaming back then and this film was an inspiration, although even then I realized that the Panther tank was really an American tank destroyer disguised as a Panther.  There were two other movies that I also watched at least once every summer in 1964 and 1965: ""Red Ball Express"" and ""Breakthrough"" which took the American campaign from Normandy across France in 1944. This was the war my father and all my friend's fathers fought in.
If you are a serious student of World War II, or perhaps of WWII films this is definitely well worth a look.  It depicts the attitude and spirit of the post-WWII era when such a large proportion of the populaton were veterans.  Historically, you also get an somewhat accurate depiction of armored warfare in France in 1944 and the campaign that went to the Siegfried Line.  You do not get much past September of 1944 to things such as the Heurtgen Forest, the Ardennes Offensive or the long hard slog through across the Rhine, but hey, this was a movie, not a seminar.
I recommend buy, even with the painfully slapstick cast of charachters who were a cliche when Shakespeare used them. Enjoy!",1432598400,,1316,4.466666666666667
651213,3,630343102X,"THE TANKS ARE COMING is based on the story of Sgt. Lafayette Pool, the top US tank ace of World War II with 258 confirmed kills including tanks and other armored vehicles. Even more remarkable is that Pool accomplished this amazing feat in only 84 days of combat. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor but did not receive the medal because it is for individual heroism, and the 258 kills were the result of Pool and his crew working as a team. Pool commanded three different M4 Sherman tanks all named ""In the Mood"". Pool was nicknamed ""War Daddy"" by his crew which is the inspiration for Brad Pitt's nickname in FURY.
Pool was offered the job of technical adviser by Warner Bros. on THE TANKS ARE COMING, but refused because he had already sold his life story to Universal Studios which led to Pool unsuccessfully suing Warner Bros.
Among the movie's cast members are George O'Hanlon (Tucker, the alcoholic tank driver) who was the voice of George Jetson on THE JETSONS cartoon series and whose cousin, Virginia O'Hanlon, was the subject of the famous ""Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Clause"" newspaper editorial.
Paul Picerni, who played Danny Kolowicz, later became a co-star on THE UNTOUCHABLES tv series, and during World War II, was a B-24 Liberator bombardier who dropped bombs on the real ""Bridge on the River Kwai"".
Robert Horton played Capt. Horner but is oddly uncredited in the role. Horton later achieved stardom on the tv Western WAGON TRAIN.
One notable mistake in the movie is the appearance of a T26 Pershing tank (the prototype for the M26 Pershing) that appears in the movie in September, 1944, but in reality, didn't appear until March, 1945 to address the shortcomings of the M4 Sherman vs. the German Panther and King Tiger tanks.",1421625600,2,1756,4.741830065359477

I did like the authentic equipment and they even tried to make the enemy tanks look like real German Panzers rather than just using an American Patton Tank with a cross on it.",1374710400,2,698,4.395348837209302
651512,4,630343102X,"The Tanks Are Coming, 1951 film

This is the story of tanks and tankers. It is set in July 1944 when the ""iron buggies"" were going into action against the enemy. The order is given, they roll out. They stop when an anti-tank rocket is fired at one tank. An HE shell brushes them away. A Panther tank is a more difficult opponent, their 75mm shells bounce off its armor! The Panther's cannon stops the American tanks. But another Sherman tank fires at its more vulnerable rear! The wounded Sergeant is replaced. Staff Sergeant Sullivan is the new leader of the replacement tank. He makes his own luck and doesn't want people who make mistakes. They advance up to 90 miles a day until a destroyed bridge stops them. They find a place where they can ford the river.

An enemy machine gun fires at them until their cannon replies. But there is another bigger cannon behind them! There is a duel, the Sherman tank triumphs. Sgt. Sullivan is all business, and explains his actions to the lieutenant. The more powerful 88mm cannon out-shoots their 75mm cannon, they have 5"" of armor against their 3"" or armor. There is an incident in the night when a strange jeep drives down the road. ""Don't challenge it from the open!"" [Some people don't like good advice.] A captured enemy officer provides information to the Americans. A burnt-out tank will be used for a road block. Sgt. Sullivan searches for his dispersed crew in town. The Germans are retreating. An observer sees enemy soldiers advancing and reports it. American cannon drop shells. After this the enemy soldiers surrender. Then more surrendered soldiers arrive, driven by Sgt. Sullivan. ""What a guy!"" The observer is recommended for a Silver Star. The latest American tank arrives for Pfc. Ike, it has a 90mm gun.

The American army approached the Siegfried Line. Engineers are sent forward to destroy the obstacles. They are shelled. Sullivan tries to drive over the ""teeth"". The new American tanks are superior to their enemy. Sgt. Sullivan pushes dirt over those ""teeth"" to provide a bridge for the other tanks. Heinrich meets his grandparents! Sullivan meets a stray dog. Later he is offered a promotion to lieutenant (and a transfer). They wind them up and roll them out.

This story is both a drama and a lesson in proper behavior. Sgt. Sullivan is a man who makes his own luck by being careful and cautious. These lessons are woven into the story. But these scenes may only be the highlights of actual events. Parts seem to be like a training film. It would have been helpful to have some information about the armored vehicles used in this movie. This came from a story by Samuel Fuller, army veteran, movie director, writer, and actor (""The Return to Salem's Lot""). I think Harry Brown's ""A Walk in the Sun"" or ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" were better stories about the war. I wonder how many would appreciate a monochrome movie about WW II after seventy years?",1359849600,,2918,4.704500978473582
651513,4,630343102X,"I was a tank platoon leader in the U.S. Army's 3rd Armored Division stationed in Germany in the 1980s.  So you can imagine my delight when I saw that the unit featured in this movie was none other than my own 3rd Armored Division as it was in 1944.

This movie has a mix of excellent faithfulness to historical fact with some real groaners of inaccuracy.  The radio conversation procedures used in the movie script are atrociously incorrect most of the time.  As others have pointed out, one of the new 90mm-gun-armed M26 Perhings appears in the movie story line several months before M26s appeared in actual history.  On the good side, the movie stresses the battle at Mons, Belgium which was in fact a great victory for the 3rd Armored Division in which my beloved ""Spearhead"" division really did cut off huge numbers of Germans who were attempting to retreat toward Germany.  The movie portrays this battle well, considering that we are talking about a movie made long before Spielburg and ""Saving Private Ryan.""  As others have stated, it's a joy to see a variety of real, period-correct Shermans and other vehicles such as the tank recovery vehicle in this movie.  A great strength of this movie is that the Americans are NOT portrayed as invincible and the Germans are NOT portrayed as inept mindless robots.  This movie depicts the Germans as the tough, skilled opponents they really were, and, this movie correctly shows the Americans suffering serious losses at German hands.  Thus, this movie has an honesty about it that other, more typical rah rah ray ray U.S.A. war movies from the 1950s lack.  This movie goes to great pains to make the historically correct point that American tank crewman in the their Sherman tanks were at a serious technical disadvantage facing German Panther tanks.

As a tanker myself, I was impressed at how well this movie portrayed the tank mechanics of the maintenance section and how the mechanics interacted with the tank fighting crewmen whom they supported.

One scene in this movie shows the Sherman tanks attacking a across a small river, supposedly in northern France.  I almost shouted with delight when I recognized that the river the movie makers were using was none other than Otter Creek at Fort Knox, Kentucky!  Fort Knox was, until last year, the official home and training center for the U.S. Army tank force.  American tank crewman have trained in and around Otter Creek for generations.  When I was a young soldier, I learned how to drive a tank across a river ford at precisely the point used for a battle scene in the movie!

The main character and hero in this movie is named Staff Sergeant Sullivan.  The longer the movie went on, the more I had the feeling that the character of Sullivan was based on Staff Sergeant Lafayette Poole, the absolutely factual tank ace of aces of all U.S. forces in World War II.  The Sullivan character is in 3rd Armored Division just as Poole was.  Sullivan is portrayed as a ruthlessly hard driving warrior who is a difficult subordinate, a tough boss, a man to insist on doing things his way, and, a man who turns down a promotion to officer rank to stay with his individual tank and crew.  Doing some research, I was struck that these were precisely the traits that people recall about the legendary but real-life Sergeant Poole.  Continuing my research, I discovered that Warner Brothers, who made the movie, asked Poole to be a technical advisor for the film.  Poole refused and then sued Warner Brothers for one million dollars for plagiarizing his life story!  Notwithstanding his animosity toward Warner Brothers, Poole later stated that the actor who played the fictional Sergeant Sullivan did a good job of actually playing himself, Sergeant Poole.

In sum, while this movie has the glaring faults that are typical of World War II movies made in the 1950s and 60s, it is still absolutely worth watching for all the strong points I describe above.",1325548800,11,3950,4.789085545722714
651514,5,630343102X,"This was one of the better war movies of it's era. Like most of them back then,  people die in one piece and it's bloodless. But that was standard for this time frame in filmaking. What wasn't; was the basic realism in approach and storyline. They used alot of Sherman tanks in this movie and did a fantastic job here. The movie just deals with a platoon of tanks as they struggle to keep alive accross France during the conflict. IT's well acted and even the story of the driven tank sergeant who mercilessly pushes his men to be the best AND Stay alive is a good one. There were certainly men like him in any conflict. This is a black and white movie but it doesn't hurt it in the least , although the fact that this is only on dvdr is strange.

651732,4,630343102X,"The disk has a problem. It stops and starts the playback on its own in approximately the same place in the movie. This occurs on three different DVD play devices. I haven't contacted Amazon yet about exchange but two other movies that are 'instant copies' play fine as does most of this one.

As for the movie, it is historically inaccurate as far as timeline goes. The Pershing was not deployed in Europe until Feb/March 1945. It would have saved a lot of tankers lives if it had been available in the fall of 1944. They keep referring to the German Panther tank as having an '88'. The Panther had a high velocity 75mm main gun which was quite capable of defeating the Sherman's armor at most combat ranges.

The plusses for the movie are that they made it when real Sherman tanks were available! All the Sherman's in the main scenes are 75mm gun models and are probably M4A3s with the Ford GAA engine. The background images in the title sequence show M4A3E8s with 76mm guns which didn't show up until mid to late 1944.

Since there weren't any running German tanks available, WWII U.S. Tank Destroyers were used as stand-ins.

The U.S. M36 Jackson tank destroyer actually made a decent looking Panther after strategically placed sheet metal was applied. It does, however, come up short in accuracy as most war movies do. References to the Panther being armed with an 88mm gun were one inaccuracy (75mm is correct). Another was the arrival of the Pershing heavy tank in September 1944 just in time for the breaching of the German frontier (20 arrived in March 1945). And, of course, the German general who the tankers capture is far too young to have held that rank. Ont he other hand, being it was made in '51 in Black-and-White, the war footage inserted into the movie doesn't look too much out of sorts.

There are a lot of M4 tanks, and some good shots of M3's.  I suppose it's interesting enough in that regard to recommend.  However, I wouldn't even wast time on the story.

I can not remember seeing a more historically correct film as far as the WWII Sherman Tank is concerned. If you want to see real WWII tanks in action, outside of historical footage, this film is one of the best. The acting and dialogue is a bit dated but many cliches are used that fit the period. The German uniforms and gear is historically (hysterically) very rough by any standards.  Among American armor and military collectors this film should rates high as it was filmed in 1951 when the army still had the materials in service. For that reason it would be impossible to recreate this film today without millions of dollars and computer animation, if then.

Too bad someone didn't try to ""save"" all that German armor after the war.  I know that the French and Italians used some of it for a short period in their armies.",1500336000,,277,4.411764705882353
