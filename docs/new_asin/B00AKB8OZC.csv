5445200,4,B00AKB8OZC,"I got this mainly for Way of The Dragon... As Bruce Lee only filmed a little over a half-hour for Game of Death before his passing and what he did film gets painfully cut. Picture/sound quality is good. There is also painful editing in Way of The Dragon like the nunchaku hits sound like punches, a hit sound effect with no hit, and even some of Lee's verbal sound effects are cut out (original film and dubbing). Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",1407283200,,444,4.36144578313253
5445201,5,B00AKB8OZC,the only reason this was good is the way of the dragon the game of death had bruce lee only at the very end and they cut out his good sayings that you can find on the internet from that ending why would they cut out his kick ass philoshipy?,1393200000,,240,3.82

5445211,5,B00AKB8OZC,"Bruce Lee was the greatest! These are two movies that continued his world wide notoriety and recognized him as the ""master"" of martial arts. Hollywood would not allow him to be box office royalty, but after his movies made overseas and the overwhelming notoriety and fame worldwide, somebody had to do something. Fighting over the top spot was evident and his suspicious and untimely death took care of the situation.  It is a shame that a threat to the establishment results in untimely deaths, but there is a price to pay for them.  Bruce Lee will always be remembered as ""the master"" and his death cannot erase that.",1491177600,3,619,4.722222222222222

5445220,5,B00AKB8OZC,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? For real....I'm asking you. Okay well,this in my opinion is Bruce Lee's finest work. Arguably the best fight scene of all time,an epic battle with Chuck Norris in the Roman Colosseum,and kittens. All in the same hilarious movie. You need to own Way of the Dragon. Game of Death is whatever,but it's a free bonus so that's cool.",1470614400,,390,4.585714285714285

5445245,4,B00AKB8OZC,"The only reason I bought the GOD is to get The Way Of The Dragon. When you can get 2 movies for this price ,you can't go wrong. The Game Of Death is really a disgrace to Bruce's name except for a few decent fight scenes and the unused footage that he shot before he died.  That footage includes Bruce's famous fight with his real life student Kareem Abdul Jabar. I really wanted TWOTD which imo was his masterpiece. Directed,written, starring and choreographed by the man himself. It some of Bruce's best and funniest fight scenes plus the historic film debut of Mr. Chuck Norris in one of the most memorable fight scenes in martial arts cinema. Bruce was a very clever film maker. It was very brave of him to attempt to mix comedy and martial arts. I don't think anyone else was doing it at the time and if it was it was very rare. It's a shame that he was taken away from us so soon.",1438560000,9,885,4.236686390532545

8553003,1,B00AKB8OZC,"This DVD was a waste of money. The picture quality is bad, but the sound quality is truly awful. It's so terrible that I tried to turn on subtitles because I couldn't hear the dialog well enough to follow the story. But there are no subtitles! No subtitles, no bonus features, awful picture quality and terrible sound quality.

The Way of the Dragon was actually pretty good. Watching Bruce Lee is fun and his charisma is undeniable. Watching Game of Death made me feel slimy. An obvious cashing in on Bruce Lee's fame after his death. However, the fight scenes at the end (which is the only time you actually see the real Bruce Lee other than the funeral) is amazing. And yes, you read that right. The producers used actual footage of the real Bruce Lee's funeral in this film. *shudder* I will buy better versions of these movies. But save yourself the money and skip this DVD set. It's not even worth giving away.",1503360000,,916,4.518072289156627
8553004,5,B00AKB8OZC,Bruce Lee final best last films  in way of the dragon we see bruce in an action comedy way ahead of it's time . He plays Tang Long a guy from Hong Kong who flies in to rome to vist his friend chen ching hau played by Nora Mirao he learns that a local gangster and his men wants her resturant at any cost and she refuses to sell it  they threaten guests by verbal abuse  and workers with violences . So Tang gets involve to help out becomes a threat to syndicates gang plans they hire the greatest martial artist named colt played by a young Chuck norris. This film has best fight scenes ever filmed and showdown between Lee and Norris at Rome calosseum is most memorible in film history and it was written and produced and directed by Bruce Lee. The Last final film Game of death it got nixed reviews cause of bruce lee untimely death some of film used him and stunt double to play billy lo a raising star with a  promising career ( like bruce  lee) . A gang known as syndicate that's known for it's  explorate of entertainment their  leader Dr Land played by Dean Jagger wants to cash in on his fame and his singing girlfriend as well. Billy refuses to be apart of dr Land team he is force to fight off Land's men that becomes a stunning showdown with each one on one in some great fight scenes ever caught on film .  The best part of film is when lee faces nba star Kareem Jabbar in a great showdown and in a scene they redo fist of fury where he jumps towards bunch of men shooting guns supposely blank prop guns billy lo gets shot accidently with a real bullet to kill him similar in real life to 1993 the crow with brandon lee aka bruce's son that killed him in filming.  Both films are a gem a way to remembering a ledgend that payed the way for others Rip Bruce Lee,1502323200,,1772,4.127906976744186
