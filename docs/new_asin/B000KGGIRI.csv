2690173,4,B000KGGIRI,"I can't help but get the impression that with ""The Sontaran Experiment"" the writers and producers are experimenting with the viewers just a bit. By that I don't mean the unusually short length of the storyline (two episodes instead of the standard four or the epic six) or the exclusively outdoors setting (which works well except for making the poor robot stick out like a sore thumb). Their experiment is this, I think: can we make the other factors of the show so very good that viewers will overlook the implausibility of the plot?

The answer in my case is in the affirmative, I'm afraid. I was enthralled by the brisk, tightly-scripted adventure with all of its tension. I was laughing uncontrollably at the Doctor's classic quirkiness masterfully rendered by Tom Baker--""Never throw anything away, Harry"" he tells one of his traveling companions as he tosses an object aside. I was impressed with the acting by the cast, who are able to convey a range of extreme emotions without going over the top. I was appalled by the military experiments being performed by the eponymous Sontaran, Field-Major Styre--these are truly chilling, all the more so for being convincingly authentic, as anyone familiar with Nazi war crimes or the terrible stuff the Japanese Imperial Army's Unit 731 did in Northeast China can attest. Styre himself makes for a great villain, his dismissive arrogance almost as enjoyable as the Doctor's quirkiness; by the end of basically a half hour, you love to hate him so much that watching him get his just desserts is thoroughly satisfying. In short, the show's whole crew really had me going the whole time. It was only after the story was over that cool reflection set in and it struck me: why are the Sontarans trying to ""invade"" an abandoned planet?! The whole premise of the plot is bogus, but I was taken in by the hocus-pocus, so hats off to the folks responsible for this little gem.",1174089600,12,1919,4.7975830815709966
2690174,5,B000KGGIRI,"...Oh, I am not talking about the Sontaran Experiment, the 1975 Doctor Who story, I am talking about Terrance Dicks soap-boxing on the corpse of Robert Holmes at the end of the special featurette 'Built For War'.  Somehow, DICKs, I doubt Robert Holmes was a cop, an honored war hero, and an irrational, flaming liberal.  Your tasteless, obtuse political comments were just crap, as were the editors and people who screened that item and decided to end a DVD on such a note.  Absolutely disgusting.  A pumpkin head who merely script edited one story wraps it all up in nonsensical hysteria as he puts words and intentions into the mouth of a dead man.

Aside from that being said, the DVD was rather nice, and I am glad the restro team doesn't take out or fix the natural quirks of the video (or film in most cases aside from this show).  A nice crisp story with excellent melodrama, scripting and acting.  The commentary by Hinchcliffe is always fascinating as he talks about many aspects of the production, but sadly is interrupted a little too much by Sladen who focuses on mere ostensible qualities of what she sees 90 percent of the time.  But, you can hear how well they and the whole crew of that era got along as they tell stories of what was emotionally important to them behind the scenes; Hinchcliffe's 30th birthday on the shoot, Sladen's admiration for Hinchcliffe's enthusiasm and support, a lunching Sontaran scaring a woman and her dog on a casual walk, Tom Baker nearly putting his eye out in a local darts competition between days shooting, etc.

Any DVD with commentary from the Hinchcliffe-Holmes era is wonderful to own since the writing is superb, the acting excellent, production detail and effort admirable, and the commentary on the DVDs is superb.  Pity Holmes isn't alive to add commentary, because the tales of his motives and antics sound incredible - ""Just give us something to scare the little beggars to death.""",1173744000,3,1942,4.752976190476191
2690175,5,B000KGGIRI,"The Dr. and Sarah (and Harry) transmat back to earth (10,000 years in the future) after freeing the ""Ark in Space"" of its Wirrin (sp?) infestation.  It drags a little at the end, but pretty good overall.",1173312000,,203,4.486486486486487
2690176,5,B000KGGIRI,"A slightly mis-matched pair of releases from the Doctor Who vaults comes our way from the BBC. The Invasion, an epic 8 part story from 1968 made in glorious black and white  - at the time the second longest story yet made - and a brief two-parter, The Sontaran Experiment, squeezed in from 1975. But there's a lot to enjoy here to celebrate the classic era of the show.

The Invasion stars Patrick Troughton as the second Doctor, featuring in a format that set the stage for his successor Jon Pertwee's tenure in the role. After the success of the Web of Fear a year earlier, when Yeti invaded the London Underground and the Doctor helped the British military contain the threat, the production team set about creating another London/alien invasion story, with the military presence expanded to a fictional international force known as UNIT. They brought back the same character and actor from the Yeti story to lead this force, promoted him to Brigadier and thus launched one of the most popular and enduring characters from the show's history.

This particular story was something of a milestone in Doctor Who history, even though it was born out of a panic to replace some rejected scripts. Not just because it created a new format for the show, but mainly for its impact on the viewing public. When the Cybermen emerged from the London sewers to enslave the human race, marching inexorably down the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral, the impact on the psyche of the British children watching was enormous. I know I was not alone in avoiding all sewer manhole covers for years to come! Alas, episodes 1 & 4 were junked by the BBC in 1971 and the remaining 6 were of poor quality tele-recordings. Inadequate linking material, intended to bridge the gaps, was recorded by Nicholas Courtney - The Brigadier - for the 1993 VHS release, but now the brilliant boys at Cosgrove Hall have replaced the two missing episodes in their entirety with animated recreations of the missing footage. I wasn't sure at first about the concept, but all doubts were dispelled as it is so brilliantly executed. Using the original soundtrack, the animation has been recreated perfectly and fills the void wonderfully.

Apart from the animation and phenomenal restoration work, there are many extra features describing the animation concept, process and restoration, as well as an in depth feature on the making of the programme and the era in general. The care and love that went into making these two episodes is evident. It thus seems almost churlish - and certainly geeky - to make any criticism, but there is one error which is almost unforgivable! The animators have given the Doctor's assistant Zoe the wrong costume in the early part of episode 1! It would have been an easy mistake to make, except that the previous episode (which runs immediately into this story) does exist and photos from episode 1 are abundant. They've drawn her with the costume she adopts about mid-way through the first episode. For all their attention to detail, it seems a very basic error to have made.

The commentary from Frazer Hines (Jamie), Wendy Padbury (Zoe) and Nicholas Courtney for the six live action episodes is very entertaining, as is the one from the animators and restoration team for the two missing episodes. But I wish they'd have included Derrick Sherwin, the script editor, eventual producer, creator of the UNIT format and author of this particular tale. Much as I like hearing the Brigadier, he does get used rather often on the Doctor Who commentaries. A minor quibble.

With all of these extras and goodies, it's a shame to compare the relatively thin co-release, The Sontaran Experiment. A two part adventure from Tom Baker's first season in the role of Doctor number four, this very short story really belongs as a tag-team with the preceding four-part adventure, The Ark in Space. It's really using all the location and outside broadcast allocation that didn't get used in the studio based Ark story. By releasing it alone, I think the BBC are stretching fan's patience just a tiny bit, but they have at least included a very well made documentary on the history and evolution of the Sontarans and there's a great commentary soundtrack too. Seems a bit much to shell out $13 for two episodes, but as a fan, I'm just glad to have them in my library. As the first story ever made to be made entirely on location and entirely on video tape, it's an interesting milestone in the Doctor Who evolution.

A good pair of releases. One probably too long and one probably too short, but together forming another great pair of entries into the Doctor Who DVD collection.",1173225600,3,4648,4.795255930087391
2690177,4,B000KGGIRI,"""The Sontaran Experiment"" is a breezy delight, which whips along at breakneck speed and contains some of the most delightfully absurd dialogue the series had seen, I think only ""Pyramids of Mars"" betters it. Field Marshall Styre wins the dialogue plaudits with his inspired ""I will destroy you all later....But first I have more important tasks to perform"". How can you not love a villain who refers to the Doctor as a ""worm"". Dialogue aside the 2 episode format really fits this story, which doesn't suffer from Doctor Who's perennial problem of over padding and repetition. Perhaps most important about this story though is the wonderfully cruel sadistic streak that runs through it. Some of Styre's experiments truly are abominable and I shan't spoil them here for those who haven't seen this story. This dark, horrific side of Doctor Who developed strongly under the production of Phillip Hinchcliffe and showed that Doctor Who was willing to push the boundaries of its time slot. However it must be remembered that ""The Sontaran Experiment"" does form part of a short story arc exploring the future of the human race that began with ""Ark in Space"", an awareness of this story will enhance the enjoyment of ""The Sontaran Experiment""

 The DVD itself may sound like a bit of a rip off, the main feature after all does only run for 50 minutes. But we are compensated by a very good 40 minute documentary entitled ""Built for War"" and a commentary track, which overall makes it a worthwhile purchase. This is not the deepest and thematically exciting Doctor Who story, but it very entertaining and good fun.",1169251200,29,1606,4.8791208791208796
2690178,5,B000KGGIRI,"The utilitarian voice over/animator for all sontaurans was Kevin Lindsday(except for Clinton Greyn in The Two Doctors) but I assume, as with all great voice/mask actors(jinxed to ill fate) like Michal Wisher, he is no longer with us.  Or ""has more important things to do"" than ""distroying all of us"" with DVD comentary as Tom Baker punned in T. Baker Years and joked seriously in warning, whispy tones to Liz Sladen with Peter Miles' own DVD commentary as ""Nydar"".  This is a two parter.  I do not know how well it will sell on it's own, why not put it in with ""Genisis."" or better yet ""Ark in Space"".  ""King's Deamons"" and 5 Dr.s go well also as does ""Black Orcid with Visitation"".  Liz was kind enough to do the comentary with all of her episodes with Tom Baker and as always with the directors and this time Bob Baker(no relation to Tom) who wrote many Dr. Whos including Armageddon Factor, my first DW to watch at age 9.  Ian Marter, of course is not with us.  I understand it was diabetes that took him but he was also a good writer as well as actor.  He wrote RIBOS and others like it.  This one is sort of a ""part"" of a ""quintilogy"" as some would put it with others(though not officially) and included continuity with Ark in Space, Genisis(to some degree) and Revenge of the Cybermen(as retrieving the TARDIS required the transmat back via ""time ring"") I do not see Keeper of Traken, Logopolis, and Castravalva as part of a trilogy either, but some ""claim"" an imaginary trilogy(not official mind) called the ""regeneration trilogy"".

Ian did a lot of running around in this one and was good at bringing Harry Sullivan's his altrusitic character forth, as did Tom with his ridiculous stunt antecs in breaking half his ribs in a Judo move done by Linsday as ""Feild Commander Styre"".  Liz is always good at playing the tramatised victim and is great at acting with her eyes.

2690220,3,B000KGGIRI,"The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) visits Earth circa 10,340 A.D. with Sarah Jane and Harry, expecting to find it deserted. They discover a small group of humans--a military expedition that came because of a distress signal. The group is very suspicious of the Doctor and his companions since no one had been living there for thousands of years and a mysterious ""rock creature"" has been kidnapping and torturing them. The creature turns out to be a Sontaran who has been doing some research on the humans in preparation for a galactic invasion.

The story is a typical cat-and-mouse game between the Doctor's set and the lone Sontaran. The Sontaran's military creed and ruthlessness should make him more threatening but he's not all that impressive in this episode. Some good comic lines are delivered by the Doctor and the Sontaran, but not enough to make the show a fun comedy. This two episode story is happily short because the story just doesn't have enough to keep up the dramatic tension.

This show is for Doctor Who completists. The DVD also includes a nice special feature on the history of the Sontarans in the classic Doctor Who years.",1437523200,,1142,4.821428571428571

2690228,4,B000KGGIRI,"It is important to point out that there are two ways of acquiring the DVD. Firstly, it can be purchased as a stand-alone production, or it can be bought in a box set called `Bred for War'; the set includes the Time Warrior, `The Invasion of Time' and `The Two Doctors'. Returning to the first form of release, this is what is called the standard edition, and a release designed as a lower-priced product. It was principally designed as a way of increasing the number of releases per year; however, they offer little apart from maybe audio commentary, production notes, subtitles, maybe a photo gallery, a single featurette or trailer. Just as a piece of additional information, although not applicable in this case, there are also special edition releases and they are really meant to provide a feature rich DVD. This is done by adding multiple featurette's, archival material; there may be various audio files and alternative special feature options.

The Sontaran experiment is technically a rather unusual narrative, as other reviewers have mentioned this was a production filmed entirely on location outdoors in Dartmoor. While it was meant to be a six-part episode, it was decided that the preceding series the `Ark in space' narrative, would be a four-part episode and that the remaining two episodes would effectively be a stand-alone production. In terms of continuity, from when we see the doctors' initial regeneration, in first series Robot, to the narrative - the Terror of Zygons it can be considered a continuous narrative for the TARDIS crew. The Sontaran Experiment is Tom Bakers' third outing as the doctor, and is part of the 12th season of Doctor Who. This two-part story was first broadcast on 22 February 1975. As other reviewers have done an excellent job of giving the storyline here is the briefest overview, in essence the production starts when the doctor, Harry and Sarah use the transmit beam connection to arrive on earth to ensure that the Nerva beacon is working correctly and that Earth can be re-inhabited. What they find is a rather belligerent, some would consider a rather sadistic Sontaran named Styre who has falsely sent a distress beacon and attracted group of human beings from another colony. Styre has begun experimenting on these individuals to discover their weakness as a race. The goal of Sontaran's is to ultimate defeat the human colonies in the galaxy.

Philip Hinchcliffe ostensibly used the Sontaran's, as the main vehicle for his two-parter - as he could reuse the Sontaran costume and therefore reduce the budget on producing a new alien from the ground up. It is also interesting to note that the scriptwriters specified the use of South African actors, as they were interested in multi-linguistic influences on the English language and its prospective development in a future context. Many have criticised the production as being too short, to create any real character depth and felt that the narrative could not be told in two episodes. Both critics and fans have lampooned the use, and design of robot, which was employed by the Sontaran's, to capture their human prey. Many are not convinced by the premise that the Sontaran's efforts were in any way logical or thought out. Others were critical of the sadistic nature and implied violence in terms of torture and the use of inflicted hallucinations as being not appropriate for its target audience, and especially considering when it was to be televised. However, what people did like about this series were the atmosphere and the overall iconography of the production, while others commend Tom Baker's performance and pretty much say that it was his acting that held the production together. While many would not consider this production as being one of the best, of the Tom Baker era it still has a lot of value. The use of the Sontaran's gives this production a certain chill factor. If you compare this production as well as Jon Pertwee's initial dealings with the Sontaran's, alongside their 21st century counterparts, the latter Sontaran's do not carry the same impact or gravitas, and at times can be considered comedic at best.",1422662400,2,4146,4.9898843930635834

The commentary track did not disappoint, as actress Liz Sladen and producer Phillip Hinchcliffe relate some fabulous memories on the filming and on Tom Baker's accident on Hound Tor.  The Sotaran special was done before the series was resurrected in 2005, so it's a bit dated, and while it does include some interesting tidbits, it could have been done better.

This was the first Doctor Who shot completely on location, as well as the first Doctor Who story shot on video tape.  It was also the story that Liz Sladen credits as changing her mind about leaving the show.  She stayed on for Season 13 before finally exiting the program.

2690253,5,B000KGGIRI,"Curious to see some of the speculation about the pacing, length and character of this quirky episode here ... It ought to be common knowledge by now that this story was written for the usual four episode (90 minute when combined) format most Tom Baker stories got, but that TB broke several bones during a stunt early in filming, and the whole had to be whipped together in two episodes combining faster pacing, heavy use of a stunt man, and some very gritty filming and action work by a Tom Baker in considerable pain.
All these together (along with the video-action-doc filming style and the outdoor setting with ambitious scifi set-prop work which WERE deliberate) make this story as it turned out quite unique. Plusses - Elisabeth Sladen threw even more of her usual energy and authenticity into this episode, and the oversize props (almost mini-sets) the production could afford because it was using no interiors really get a chance to shine. The spherical scout ship, Styre's space-phone, the torture devices ... all better than average for DW in this era. The traveling robot was a potential gem, but the forcibly shortened story cost it a lot of screen time.
Baker also pressed his way through several episodes a few years later with a very badly dog-bitten face (during Mary Tamm's tenure as Romana).",1410480000,2,1309,4.848214285714286

For me the old show very often tells very good stories in 3 or 4 part serials, while the new one tells many great 45 minute stories.  But when the old show goes below 3 or 4 the story is entertaining, but not fantastic, while every time the old show goes past 4 or the new show goes beyond 45 minutes I keep counting down expecting something to ruin it for me, especially on the new show.  Good ones have been made, but it's basically a toss-up whether they'll be good or not.  But enough about that, I'll just say that the Sontarans are good antagonists for the Doctor, so I always get some enjoyment out of stories with them in it.  And on the other hand, I don't think this could have been stretched out into a 4 part story so it could have been worse.  This was a good story with good acting and good dialogue.

SONTARAN EXPERIMENT
Story # 77
Season 12's Third Story
Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker Era, First Season 1974
Eighth Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL RATING 9/10
SONTARAN EXPERIMENT is a splendid little story, and an essential link in the extraordinary 6-story arc from ROBOT through TERROR OF THE ZYGONS, that transitioned the program from the Letts-Dicks-Pertwee era, to the Hinchliffe-Holmes-Baker era, anchored by the peerless TARDIS team of Sarah, Harry and the Fourth Doctor.

A very tight, taunt little story with no time for padding. Every scene is pertinent and necessary in the lean little adventure that is SONTARAN EXPERIMENT.  Very fast-paced, grabbing the viewer immediately and never letting go until the end, SONTARAN EXPERIMENT is well crafted ""Doctor Who"" at its best, in an era most Whovians still regard one of the finest in the program's long history

As the necessary link between two important WHO masterpiece stories, little two-part SONTARAN EXPERIMENT becomes essential viewing for veteran Whovians, and SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans.

STORY & SCRIPT 10/10
Another great script from the writing team of Bob Baker and Dave Martin.

The original script for ARK IN SPACE was unworkable, forcing Script Editor Robert Holmes to do a page-one rewrite, leaving him no time to put together an arc-linking story to GENESIS OF THE DALEKS.  In desperate need, Holmes called on Bob Baker and Dave Martin, two writers he confidently knew were capable of producing stories on time under great pressure.  The resulting script that became SONTARAN EXPERIMENT, shows no signs of being the rush job that it was, a testament to the talent, ability and creative genius of Bob Baker and Dave Martin.

ACTING 10/10
Flawless performances from the three regulars and all guest actors.

Kevin Lindsay, who had given the Sontaran ""Linx"" magnificent screen presence the previous season in TIME WARRIOR, was again called upon to bring Sontaran Field Major Styre to life.  Sadly, it was to be his final Sontaran performance. At only age 52, Kevin Lindsay passed away from a heart condition only two months after SONTARAN EXPERIMENT was originally broadcast.  Kevin Lindsay's remarkable Sontaran performances remain definitive and all WHO Sontaran appearances of decent quality that followed, have clearly referenced his two screen-commanding portrayals.

In the guest cast Vural(Donald Douglas) and Roth(Peter Rutherford) each stand out with excellent performances. The rest of the stranded spaceship crew do not get as much screen time, but Krans(Glyn Jones), Erak(Peter Walshe) and ""Prisioner""(Brian Ellis), each create compelling characters in their short appearances.  Such memorable, stand out guest-cast performances are remarkable in a short two-part story, the reason SONTARAN EXPERIMENT scenes stand out as well-remembered as any from the Hinchcliffe-Holmes era.

The great TARDIS team of Elisabeth Sladen, Ian Marter and Tom Baker, working together in such a smoothly natural way, grab the viewer immediately in Part 1.  Humorous verbal sparring marvellously contrasts the three TARDIS travellers: old-fashioned Harry, feminist-leaning Sarah, and the quirky, alien larger-than-life Fourth Doctor. But there is a subtle, family-like affection within the verbal sparring that allows the viewer to sense that this TARDIS team cares very much about each other.

Elisabeth Sladen's ""Sarah"" is independent, intelligent, competent and confident.  At this stage, early in the Tom Baker era, Lis Sladen is moving ""Sarah"" away from the strident feminist she was first written as, into simply a woman who stands up for herself.  This makes ""Sarah"" refreshingly, a real person.  ""Sarah"" is naturally feminine, and can give a girly scream to rival the best of them, but being so feminine doesn't make Sarah weak, helpless or less-than-capable at all.  No viewer doubts the ability of bright, gutsy, resourceful Sarah, to go it alone to rescue the Doctor and Harry, after both ignored her common-sense advice and fell into the same deep hole.  Early in Part 1, Sarah's ""little-girl"" reaction to the Doctor's ignoring her likewise makes her real and also endears her to the audience making for a powerful connection. The realistically complex, feminist-but-feminine ""Sarah Jane"" enchanted and charmed generations of WHO fans timelessly across the decades from Classic Series to New Series, all due primarily to the unique acting instinct, skill and artistry of Elisabeth Sladen, a genuine one-of-a-kind-talent.

Being a companion for only six stories means ""Harry"" is often forgotten and overlooked on ""Best Companion Lists"". However, Ian Marter does an amazing job with the character.  Harry is humorously clumsy and bumbling, and given to pushing buttons without paying attention to what happens.  He's an old-fashioned Naval Officer, whose life-view is from a past era, out of place in the present time in which he lives. Sarah seems to be the apple of the Doctor's eye , so it's Harry who catches the unpredictable irritable moods of the Fourth Doctor. Through it all, Harry remains bright, cheery and good-natured, even when being called a ""ham-fisted idiot"" or ""imbecile"" by the Doctor. But the viewer clearly sees that Harry is courageous, competent and capable, and he WILL get the job done, regardless of what name the Doctor calls him.  Harry very much stands out and is likeable to modern viewers in his old-fashoined sense of duty and responsibility, and in the chivalrous way he watches carefully over Sarah, like a little sister, even when she bites his head off doing it!  Harry is a remarkable character, as brought to life by Ian Marter, and very memorable in the way he shaped the superb six-story-arc he is in.

In only his second story production, Tom Baker already owns the role of ""the Doctor"".  He is a total natural in the role, and his screen presence is commanding.  Yet he gels remarkably with Elisabeth Sladen and Ian Marter, in such a way that each member of the trio is compelling, and each shines without taking attention from the others, and it is hard to precisely define just how that occurs. But, somehow, in Tom Baker's first 6 stories, the entire TARDIS trio of ""Sarah, Harry and Dr#4"" are most memorable as a team together, even in the commanding presence of Tom Baker's ""Fourth Doctor"".  All of Tom Baker's era, Seasons 12-18 are good, but his first three Seasons do genuinely stand out. Seasons 12-14 are all a remarkable WHO era that seems timeless, even at this distant viewpoint of 40 years past original production, with Season 12 productions having the special glow just described.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 10/10
Superb production across the board.  Excellent, flawless direction by Rodney Bennett. Special effects seamlessly integrated into the video. Excellent use of location. SONTARAN EXPERIMENT is so well-crafted that there is little production-wise to be criticized.  The main realistic criticism of SONTARAN EXPERIMENT is that it is not a stand-alone WHO story capable of introducing new viewers to the program, as many of the essentials of DOCTOR WHO are missing. There is no TARDIS, no references to the unique abilities of a Time Lord, or to any of the other foundations of the program.  The features that make SONTARAN EXPERIMENT such a tight, well-crafted, superb little linking story, are the very features that hinder it as a stand-alone WHO story.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 10/10
SONTARAN EXPERIMENT is the way special effects should be done. The quietly efficient special effects do not draw attention from the script and actors performing the story; the effects do precisely what is needed to tell the story and no more.  In a story as well-crafted as SONTARAN EXPERIMENT, that is all that is needed.

STORY IMPORTANCE 10/10
An essential story in the amazing 6-story arc from ROBOT through TERROR OF THE ZYGONS.  An extraordinary story arc of quality and transition, moving the program flawlessly from Third Doctor to Fourth Doctor era, from Letts-Dicks to Hinchcliffe-Holmes production, and from a uniquely British TV show to an international audience.

Historically, SONTARAN EXPERIMENT is the very first story to be produced by Philip Hinchcliffe, as it was actually filmed before ARK IN SPACE, the story it followed in broadcast order, in order to make use of longer daylight hours on location.

Simple, solid little two-part SONTARAN EXPERIMENT may well rate among the more important stories in the history of the program, as it was the simple little story that perfectly linked, the two WHO masterpiece stories before and after it, into a mesmerizing series of 12 episodes that GRABBED an international audience.

DVD EXTRAS 9/10
Extras are surprisingly good for the short 2-part linking story that SONTARAN EXPERIMENT actually is. (In many ways it would make more sense to release SONTARAN EXPERIMENT as part of an ARK IN SPACE package!) The documentary BUILT FOR WAR is very comprehensive, informative and entertaining, and it is particularly fascinating, and at the same time depressing, to actually see the changes and production quality degradation as the Sontarans progress from the 3rd to 6th Doctor eras!

The unmoderated commentary by Elisabeth Sladen, Bob Baker and Philip Hinchclife is not only excellent and informative, it's also great fun to listen to. And the excellent onscreen text commentary by Martin Wiggins is simply too good to miss.

2690317,2,B000KGGIRI,"Okay, I've got to say that I rather enjoy the older Doctor Who episodes and even some that take place primarily in quarries, but this took running around in quarries to a new low.  Seriously, all they do the whole serial is run around the quarry, get captured, get away, run around some more, get captured again, etc.  It all feels like perhaps the Sontaran's are playing pretend with a bunch of captured ""friends"" rather than actually trying to learn about human biology.  There is an amusing ending, but I feel it would have been cleverer if the Doctor had simply been trying to get the Sontaran to turn around so he could smack him in the probic vent.  That was the way to beat them in The Time Warrior, so why not in The Sontaran Experiment?",1354838400,,745,4.416058394160584

2690320,4,B000KGGIRI,Tom Baker was still getting his feet under him as the Doctor. He even fell and broke a collar bone filming it. The story is short but I enjoyed it.

2690321,3,B000KGGIRI,"The real ""experiment"" in this story was to see whether one could tape a two-parter entirely on location coupled with a four-part story taped entirely in the studio, in this case ""The Ark in Space,"" thus producing two stories for the same cost as one six-parter.

It's fun to watch how the BBC managed to produce ""The Sontaran Experiment"" on such a shoestring: only one Sontaran appears at a time because the show could only afford the one costume, recycled from ""The Time Warrior""; the program reused the Sontaran ship from the earlier Jon Pertwee story as well, simply rehanging the door to make it open the other way. There are no sets in this story, only Dartmoor National Park in Devon, which viewers are asked to believe is downtown London, long buried after thousands of years of disuse. The only additional special effect really is a spindly 7-foot robot that patrols the countryside; it had to move on rails laid down out of camera shot and actually works quite well.

Then, in Episode 2, Tom Baker slipped on a patch of wet grass while confronting the Sontaran--and broke his collarbone! The production covered for him by taping a stunt double from behind for several action scenes. Later scenes of Baker were taped with the Doctor's scarf cleverly bracing his arm. Poor Kevin Lindsay, who returns as the Sontaran after playing the one in ""The Time Warrior,"" remained on location during lunch breaks because movement in the rigid Sontaran costume was too exerting. (Lindsay suffered from a weak heart and, in fact, died of a heart attack less than two months after ""The Sontaran Experiment"" first aired.)

The Special Features menu includes ""Built for War,"" a comprehensive 40-minute documentary (almost as long as ""The Sontaran Experiment"" itself) tracing the history of the Sontarans from their debut in ""The Time Warrior"" to their final appearance in the original series, ""The Two Doctors,"" with Patrick Troughton and Colin Baker.",1313884800,,1942,4.9327217125382266
2690322,4,B000KGGIRI,"This story is dark. The Doctor, Harry and Sarah Jane beam down from the Ark in Space to Earth to see if it's habitable again centuries after a nuclear holocaust and to fix the transmat machinery so that the preserved humans on the ship may come down to the planet. While there they get seperated and discover a group of paranoid astronauts who have been taken, one by one, by the 'creature in the rocks' (the Sontaran mentioned in the title) and been the subject of inhuman tortures devised as experiments to determine the abilities of humanity in preparation for a possible invasion. Like I said: dark stuff (though it's from the Philip Hinchcliffe era, so that's to be expected). It's also a very well-paced, acted, and produced story. On the other hand, it's only two episodes, so it's quite short as well. This was also one of the earlier DVD releases, so there's not much in the way of special features. Those last two points are the main reason I docked a star from my rating. The story itself is worthy of five stars, but the overall value of the package isn't that great due to how little you actually get. I wish they'd released it as a box set coupled with another Sontaran story or two (""The Time Warrior"" perhaps?) like they did with the ""Beneath the Surface"" package which contains three stories (two classics, one not so much) involving humanoid reptiles who want to retake the Earth since they were once the dominant species. Or, perhaps they could've issued two consecutive stories in a single package much like they did with the First Doctor serials ""The Rescue"" and ""The Romans"". Oh well. It's still a great story, so I highly recommend picking it up on the cheap if you get the chance!",1289001600,4,1704,4.590163934426229

First) The episode is extremely short.  The shortest episode of all of the Fourth Doctor episodes.  I think the total episode is only 2 parts long and take up only 40 minutes show time.

Second) It is really a continuation of the Ark in Space episode, with the
Doctor going down to the planet to prepare for the colonists to embark on
the planet.  So it is not exactly a stand alone episode.  It really should of been included on a DVD with the Ark and Space episodes.  Should not be included on a DVD as a stand alone episode, because it is not a stand alone episode.

Third) There are a few good scenes in it, and I would say that it is worth watching.  But I wouldn't go out and spend as much money as they are asking on Amazon to buy it, especially since this is not one of the best of the Fourth Doctor episodes.

2690341,5,B000KGGIRI,"This one is a really great episode, one of my personal favorites. Tom Baker plays Doctor Who and Sarah is his sidekick along with one other male sidekick.

Doctor Who stops off on Earth (far in the Earth's future when it is no longer inhabited) to make repairs to some equipment that he has based there. Sarah and her friend come along for some R&R in the beautuful English countryside but they run into a ""hole-trap"" right away! Pretty soon some human astronaults show up and they are very suspicious of the TARDIS trio because some of their crew members have been killed.

The facts ultimately show that it is Styre, the Sontaran, along with his devilish mobile robot, who has been torturing and killing off the astronaults. He had lured them to Earth with a fake distress call and then destroyed their space ship after they had landed. Styre is conducting ""experiments"" on humans to detect all their mental and physical inferiorities, (e.g., by water deprivation, by mashing them, etc.), so that his tribe can invade the galaxy and exploit these weaknesses. His superiors are awaiting his final report prior to the invasion.

But Doctor Who has other plans for the Sontarans!

The Sontaran, Styre, looks like a giant russett potato with arms and legs and dressed in a cool space suit, and is actually made up quite good. His robot is also a timeless work of tinsmithing art. The cinematography in this entry is spectacular and the action is constant.

If I have a singular critique of this one it's that it is one of the shorter Doctor Who episodes, having only two parts. Still, it's very worthwhile television. My highest recommendation.",1201305600,2,1642,4.767605633802817

2690354,5,B000KGGIRI,This is the only story from this season that I did not see as a kid.  It is a very good short story.  It is fast paced compared to most 1970s television.  It is typical in the since that the bad guys are basically Germans.  The Sontarans have German sounding names.  This is true throughout most of Doctor Who.  The story links very well in between The Ark in Space and Genesis of the Daleks.,1192579200,,392,4.16
2690355,3,B000KGGIRI,"Well, I shouldn't say ""least essential"".  The ""Doctor Who"" DVD production team made a herculean effort trying to salvage this rather awkward little story.  There's not much you can do to give the hard sell to a 45-minute episode from 1975 when releasing it on a standalone DVD.  However, the folks at ""2 Entertain"" gave it their all.  The story has been visually restored so that it looks as if it had been videotaped yesterday, and the few special features are meticulous.

Unfortunately, the episode being supported is not deserving of such kind consideration.  ""The Sontaran Experiment"" was the first production from the Phillip Hinchcliffe/Robert Holmes producer/script editor team, which gave us a dozen of ""Doctor Who""'s finest hours in the mid 1970s.  As an opening act, this is not one of those hours.  Featuring the return of the Sontarans, created by then-writer Holmes one season previously, ""Experiment"" features a villain not nearly as resourceful, clever or memorable as ""The Time Warrior"".  The actor is the same but the writer is not, and that's most of the difference.

Since Sontaran actor Kevin Lindsey was in the final stages of heart failure, his character only appears in the final episode and doesn't get much to do.  The rest of the story features the small cast running around a pile of rocks on Dartmoor.  The rocks are very pretty.  Indeed, the digitially remastered outdoor-broadcast video from 1975 looks fabulous -- this story could have been produced yesterday.  Compare that with the feeble non-remastered look of the 1977 baseball World Series, recently released to DVD in the U.S., and you appreciate that this is a terrific restoration job.

The text commentary, as usual, is a lively affair written by Martin Wiggins, sharing with us some gruesome on-location anecdotes (mostly about Tom Baker's broken collarbone) and interesting discarded ideas from the story's first drafts (the mating habits of the Sontarans, and the British relics the authors intended should protrude from the Earth's surface thousands of years into the future where the story's set).  The three-man audio commentary team -- Hinchcliffe, writer Bob Baker, and actress Lis Sladen -- share their crystal-clear memories from 30+ years ago.  Compared to the commentary track from the sister DVD release (1969's classic ""The Invasion"") one begins to appreciate an inverse ratio between the quality of the story and the quality of the commentary.

The lone featurette produced for the disc is a comprehensive 39-minute history of the Sontarans.  Called ""Built For War"", the documentary covers all of the Sontarans' ""Doctor Who"" appearances between 1974 and 1985, and thus features interviews with many people who had nothing to do with ""Experiment"" at all.  Script editor Terrance Dicks (who did not script-edit this episode) reminisces about his relationship with writer Bob Holmes (who did not write it).  Future Doctor Colin Baker (who did not appear in this episode) and future script editor Eric Saward (who did not script-edit it) take turns harshing on the 1985 Sontaran entry ""The Two Doctors"".  The two men also take turns seeing who can reach 400 pounds first.  Colin wins, although Saward grows an impressive mop of hair to finish in second place by a single ounce.  Good heavens, Colin!  The normally zaftig Dicks looks like Nicole Richie next to those two.",1186876800,10,3372,5.120658135283364
2690356,3,B000KGGIRI,"This is another better-than-average story in the 1st year of Tom Baker's 7 year tenure.

I felt this story to be OK, but not great.  The story wasn't great and I didn't thing the original content had been that well acted.  The story isn't a key story either, (unlike it's successor) which may explain the lower budget input.",1185494400,,324,4.551724137931035
2690357,4,B000KGGIRI,"""The Sontaran Experiment"" is shorter than most Doctor Who episodes and is missing a few hallmarks of the series, but has some excellent dialog.  If you like Tom Baker's humor this is a good budget title for you, but if you want a more in depth plot look elsewhere.  I suggest ""Genesis of the Daleks"" and ""The Robots of Death"".  ""The Sontaran Experiment"" is only about 50 minutes long, but the DVD includes a 39 minute ""Built for War"" documentary on the Sontaran race for those interested the series' background as told by actors (not Tom Baker) and some production team.",1184630400,,570,4.623762376237623

2690359,4,B000KGGIRI,"In short, I loved this episode of classic Doctor Who. Tom Baker is proabably my favorite Doctor, including the new series actors - you can say what you want about the classic series sets or special effects, but the scripts were, for the most part, superior in Baker's Era (there are exceptions, not saying that). And Tom Baker was an excellent Doctor. This story is a 2 part story that is short and sweet. It revived the Sontarans as villians, and gave an additional tie-in to the Ark In Space story line (the previous story). Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan were good companions for the Doctor, and I have come to appreciate their performances much more in my more mature years for differing aspects to my original veiwing back when I was a kid. Very well played. And Tom Baker plays the Doctor very well, soldiering through half the episode with a broken arm.

Anyway, if you like Doctor Who, you'll enjoy this one. The extras on the DVD were good too.

That's all for now.",1178928000,,979,4.52542372881356
2690360,4,B000KGGIRI,"This short story arc was part of 3 connected arc, infact the VHS version combined this one with ""Genesis of the Daleks"" for a two cassette set. If you are new to Dr. Who this could be a weak place to start, for example:

--no TARDIS, the Doctor and companions Sarah & Harry are Transmatted to the surface of a nearly uninhabited future Earth leaving the TARDIS behind on a spacestation, then transmatt again at the end. The story maybe historical in the fact the the famous Police Call-Box never appears This is followed by the second and last time that this happens in Genesis, in which they are intercepted by the Timelords, then leave with a Timering, catching up with the TARDIS in the final story Revenge of the Cyber-men.

--Another omission that may confuse the unintiated in viewing this story arc is that upon the climax the Doctor claims to be the Human ""warrior class"" to confuse the Sontaran advanced scout, but there is no referance that would establish otherwise if you are just starting out. In fact in the 70's when alot of American was just meeting the Timelord for the first time this may have been their first encounter with the series. I was one of those people, but it was ""Revenge"" that hooked me with the Cyber-men and eventually the arrival of the TARDIS.

Inspite of this it is a fun story, some pretty location, no quarries and the retrospective extra with the Sontarans is well done.",1178928000,,1410,4.587301587301587
2690361,5,B000KGGIRI,"i'd like to say ""DOCTOR WHO"" is probally one of my favorite television series of all time. second only to ""STAR TREK"". even then i couldn't chose between them.

 TOM BAKER is also one of my personal favorites as ""THE DOCTOR"". if you haven't seen any of them. START at once. the series itself is very complex and i won't bother to get into that.

 i will just focus on this episode. it's a rather odd one because it's only a two parter. but it packs a whallop in being short. the SONTARAN's are again menacing the earth. after leaving ""NOVA BEACON"" later to be named. in it's past it was called ""NERVA BEACON"". but that is another story with the Cybermen ""REVENGE OF THE CYBERMEN.

  the Doctor, Sarah and Harry arrive on earth using the Transmat beam and get involved with saving the earth yet again. seems the Doctor can't go anywhere with out trying to save our butts. good thing he is on our side.

  Tom Baker shines brightly as ever in his portrayal of him. you like any story that he's in. his personality steals the show! enjoy

2690362,4,B000KGGIRI,"Nice little story; compact and succinct, it's the filler between the two slices, The Ark in Space and the monumental Genesis of the Daleks. Any fan of the show knows what this is about so there's no point in recounting the story.

I do wonder why the Beeb couldn't have put this on the same disc as Ark as they have done with several of the VHS releases, except to screw me out of more money. They know I'm going to buy it but at least it's budget-priced.",1175644800,,455,4.170454545454546
