I've always admired Ingrid Newkirk for her compassion, insight, dedication, and courage, and this DVD did not disappoint me.

2924352,5,B000UR9TJQ,"I saw this on HBO and bought the DVD. Ingrid Newkirk is an intense woman, but she certainly gets attention for her cause with her colorful stunts, and I admire her dedication. (As she points out, caring humans are the only voice that abused animals have.) The animal abuse scenes are brief - I already knew the horrors of the fur industry, but the footage of the nightmarish abuse of turkeys by Butterball caused me to stop eating chickens and turkeys. Overall the documentary is a fascinating, even-handed look at PETA.",1196208000,6,520,4.725274725274725
2924363,2,B000UR9TJQ,"its a very well made documentary and very educational.

i would like to say that i support PETA but i cant. i fully believe in everything that they are doing for the animals (minus the hypocritical killings) but don't like how they try to make their points. in Ingrid's eyes, ""there is no bad publicity"" yet there really is.

there are many people that are completely turned off by PETA's outrageous tactics and think anyone that tries to support animal rights is nuts. in fact, simply doing a peaceful protest against puppy mills draws a lot of these people to poke fun, say we're crazy and assume that we are a part of PETA, which we are not.

PETA has done some good but has also damaged the name of animal activists and advocates for eternity. we are stuck fighting even harder for the animals because of what they have done.",1256256000,10,829,4.47682119205298

2924365,1,B000UR9TJQ,"This film is full lies and propaganda they say they care for animals and are for animal rights.
But those are lies .The truth is peta kills over  90% of the animal they get .They don't even
to try find homes for them while the other animal shelters in the same area find homes for 85%  of there animals. Peta employees have been found going to animal shelters telling them they were there to help them find home for the animals .Then after they got the animals would  kill them in  there van with lethal injections or wait until got back to HQ. Then they take bodys and throw  them in dumpers. And those empoyees have been arested for animal cruelty .Ingrid newkirk knew  about it and was for it. They terrorist and satist who get off by killing heathy animals. If you want the TRUTH go to peta kills [...] or to U Tube type in Peta lies. Any how I say

2924367,5,B000UR9TJQ,"Say what you will about Ingrid Newkirk, she put animal rights activism on the map. Filmmaker Matthew Galkin was granted unprecedented access to this notoriously private co-founder of PETA, giving us glimpses of how she and her intrepid colleagues execute many of their controversial tactics, including naked demonstrations and a protest against designer Jean-Paul Gaultier inside his fur-filled Paris boutique. We also hear from PETA's detractors, who criticize their efforts as stunts or simply label them terrorists. Not for the faint of heart, the documentary is punctuated by gruesome undercover footage obtained inside research labs and slaughterhouses; one scene of an animal skinned alive is particularly upsetting. These horrific images illustrate why PETA uses video to shock the public from complacency. An engrossing if not terribly penetrating study, ""I Am an Animal"" is a candid portrait of an organization that has become for many people the face of animal advocacy.

2924369,5,B000UR9TJQ,"I really enjoyed this movie and anyone who wants to get to know Ingrid personally, or PETA and their mindset and tactics, or are simply involved in veganism and/or animal protection really need to view this film.

-The movie offers great personal, intimate insight into the organization and its current leader. It'll allow you to peer into their said logic behind their tactics as well.

-I was elated to view that the film offered very necessary criticisms of PETA and, if i may make a blanket statement, the more radical faction of the modern Animal Rights Movement.

If you think there's even a slight chance this movie will appeal to you I recommend viewing it-It'll be worth your time!",1203033600,,690,4.781512605042017
2924370,4,B000UR9TJQ,"This is a very interesting documentary about PETA, but for a more comprehensive overview of the animal rights movement, I recommend the recent award-winning documentary ""Your Mommy Kills Animals!"" (Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't currently carry it, but it is easy to find elsewhere.) ""YMKA""  focuses on the less well-known and more radical grassroots animals rights groups such as SHAC, some of whom see PETA as a mainstream sell-out. (PETA declined to be interviewed for this film.)  YMKA also gives more air time to moderate animal welfare groups and to the opponents of animals rights. As a result, it provides a fascinating view of the diverse and at times conflicting wings of the animal rights movement. YMKA is interesting not only for learning about the animal rights movement, but also for better understanding the tensions between radicals and moderates that occur within many other social movements as well. YMKA and ""I am an Animal"" cover somewhat different ground, so both are well worth seeing.",1201910400,,1007,5.209876543209877
2924371,5,B000UR9TJQ,"""I Am An Animal"" balanced the life of Ingrid Newkirk, her heroic work and the work of others that have given PETA a questionable reputation. The story is simple as her personal life. But as a super hero given the work she loves she performs miracles and is rewarded and criticized. The animal scenes are graphic and haunting, but it will make a true believer and activist of many who watch this film. For those who believe in and support PETA it reaffirms every belief and tactic. For those who have been less aware it is a real eye opener and insight to a human who has devoted her life to a greater challenge. It's a must see for all in the hope that more people will follow, ""Animals are not for us to eat, wear or entertain us"".",1201392000,2,732,4.273381294964029
2924372,5,B000UR9TJQ,"This is a wonderful documentary. It shows the truths about PETA and the causes they stand for. It also shows the true cruelty of the fur and meat industries. After watching this documentary, you will hopefully have an enlightened perspective of why PETA members work so hard to bring hope to abused, tortured, and neglected animals. We try to suppress what goes on behind closed doors. When we sit down at the table and eat, do we ever contemplate what the animal went through before it graced your table? Of course not. We'd rather pretend that everything is OK but the truth is that everything is not OK. Please for your sake and the sake of all of God's creatures watch this documentary. It may change your life or at least enlighten you to think differently about the choices you've made regarding animals.",1200096000,8,810,4.671328671328672
2924383,5,B000UR9TJQ,"Thought you knew everything there was to know about PETA, the animal rights movement, and how animals are really treated before they're turned into a burger or a belt? Think again. You need to see this documentary.

Before I go any further, let me tell you that I've never been a big fan of PETA. One of the main reasons I didn't support them was because I didn't agree with their shock tactics.  Then I watched the movie and found out how monkeys in labs are restrained and tortured, turkeys have their legs broken by cruel, indifferent workers, and live animals were once used as crash test dummies. All of these cruel acts are way more shocking than anything PETA could ever do!

Now instead of getting annoyed by protesters, I am enraged that there even has to be protesters to fight for what should be common, human decency toward animals. That said, I highly, highly recommend this movie. Filled with interviews from supporters and detractors, this documentary is surprisingly well-balanced. Not only does it provide you with an unbiased view of how animals are treated in this world, but it will also open your eyes and make you think twice about the food that you put into your mouth, and the clothes that you put on your back.",1200096000,17,1235,4.63013698630137
2924384,5,B000UR9TJQ,"I never thought I would say this, but Ingrid Newkirk is one of the most fascinating people in the world and I Am an Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA shows us why. From her fascinating childhood to her strong personal fight for all living beings, director Matthew Galkin explores all sides of Ingrid and PETA.

I Am an Animal is very balanced, presenting various points-of-view that do not agree with the incredible work PETA has accomplished for animals. Highlighting the Butterball investigation was a great move on Galkin's part, demonstrating to the audience how very tenacious Ingrid and the people who work for PETA are when it comes to fighting for the rights of all animals.

As someone who cares for animals, but never considered giving up meat or anything like that, I have always distanced myself from PETA due to their sometimes outrageous tactics, but I would definitely recommend this documentary to all viewers--it displays another, more serious side to PETA that the media does not show you. It's the story of a truly extraordinary woman whose accomplishments should be a lesson to us all.",1199750400,9,1116,4.8994708994708995
2924385,5,B000UR9TJQ,"The DVD ""I Am an Animal"" is a riveting look at one of the founders of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the cause that moves her to get up everyday and come to work for a very average working wage.  It not only shows you the inner workings of Ingrid Newkirk's mind, but gives you insight into the way others in the fight for animal rights regard her and the PETA organization.  I thought it was extremely brave of the producers of ""I Am an Animal"" to give such massive airtime and footage to PETA's detractors which tells me how seriously PETA does in fact take its work.  Ingrid and the organization are not ashamed to show all of what and who they are.  Their primary goal is to show the naked truth of how all animals are perceived and therefore treated in human culture... which is poorly.

This dvd is not for the faint of heart.  I choked back tears many times throughout, but walked away with such reverence for Ms. Newkirk, PETA and their work.  What will be most surprising and a question for you to ask yourself is how could you walk away unchanged after seeing it?  Hopefully change will be afoot.",1198627200,6,1129,4.368421052631579
2924386,5,B000UR9TJQ,"I purchased this video because of Ingrid Newkirk and people like her who have sacrificed great amounts of effort for the welfare of animals.
No animal has ever freely signed a ""consent"" form to be tortured, performed medical experiments on, or be subject to any form of suffering for the advancement of science (or for any other reason for that matter).

I am so thankful for the efforts of Ingrid, and so many  people like her who stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.

2924387,1,B000UR9TJQ,"This documentary is very informative.  I learned that not only are animals being mistreated, but that there are plenty of nut jobs that get involved in speaking out against this issue.  I am an animal lover and felt that PETA was a proper organization to give to.  After this video I have learned that PETA really is a terrorist organization and should not be applauded for the domestic terrorism they commit.  My eyes are open so much wider now  thanks to this documentary.  There is a way to tackle all issues we face in this world.  Using dangerous unlawful means is not the way to go about being proactive and productive as should be obvious from watching this video.",1196985600,9,671,4.588235294117647
2924388,5,B000UR9TJQ,"I monitor a lot of right-wing talk radio, and I've noticed how often PETA and Ingrid Newkirk are targets of their derision.  The reason is that they are threats to the markets and profits of the  meat industry, as well as those who make money off of selling animals for demonic tests that Nazi doctors like Mengele would appreciate.
Newkirk has created an organization that is extremely effective.  Not only have they ended unnecessary experimentation, and helped to create less savage conditions in some meat processing plants, they've moved many people to vegetarianism and have expanded the meat-free options on menus across the country.  They have also helped spur the growth of the ""free range"" chicken market, and customers of businesses around the world are pushing for ever more considerate behavior of animals.
In ""I Am an Animal,"" Ingrid challenges all sorts of sacred cows of our society, including our obsession with sex, and the desire of so many people to have kids when there are already so many children who need homes.  She says something like, ""I think it's very selfish of people to need a replica of themselves when there are so many children without parents.""  Newkirk, who was once married herself, says her marriage ended because she ""simply didn't have the time for it,"" and instead chose to dedicate her life to reducing the suffering of sentient beings.  Buddha would be proud.  We need more people like her.
Kudos to HBO for producing this important film, and to those who will use this DVD as a tool to inspire awareness and change in others.

2924389,5,B000UR9TJQ,"While it seems that all of the reviews before me gave this documentary five stars for the bravery, willpower and commitment of Ingrid Newkirk, I have to say that my reasoning for giving it five stars is a little different.  First of all let it be known that I agree with Newkirk and PETA that there are many horrible things happening to animals throughout the world.  I also agree that mankind should step up to protect these animals as best as we can.  However, I highly disagree with Newkirk's attention-getting tactics.  From naked running of the humans to caged humans protesting a circus to ""Un-Happy Meals"" to vandalizing storefronts, PETA is, at times, a borderline cult.  This documentary highlights the sometimes tasteless and illegal tactics used by the group to promote their message.  I completely understand attacking sacred cows, but any advertising class will inform you that such actions can produce results on both ends of the spectrum.  Representatives of other animal rights groups such as the Humane Society are interviewed as well as the now-departed co-founder of PETA, Alex Pacheco.  All of them call into question the motives and the actions of Newkirk and her group.

A revealing expose of Butterball and ConAgra is also shown.  It shows the process that PETA goes through in order to get inside a slaughterhouse and what they do in order to gather evidence to form a case against the company.  We also get to see a freed turkey from the Butterball plant live in a containment room until a home is found for it.  The oddity of it all is that Newkirk and the investigator leave the turkey alone in a brightly lit room with soothing sounds playing in the background.

We also get a glimpse at the ""look at me"" crowd in Hollywood basically using Newkirk and PETA to gain exposure.  Bill Maher, who's responses to questions in this documentary draw doubts about his sanity, is also highlighted.

A possible connection between PETA and animal rights terrorist groups such as the E.L.F. and A.L.F. is also explored, although PETA completely denies any direct affiliation with such groups.

As much as ""I Am A Friend Of God"" tries to show the extremes of fundamentalist Christians in the United States, ""I Am An Animal"" shows the extremes of the animal rights movement.  While there are definitely some terrible things happening to animals in the world and groups such as the Humane Society are trying to put a stop to them rationally, this documentary shows us just how irrational and, dare I say, semi-psychotic some animal rights activists can be.

I highly recommend this documentary.  It does move the viewer to want to go out and help an animal, but I don't think that PETA is taking the proper action to get things corrected.",1196294400,11,2750,4.812765957446809
2924390,5,B000UR9TJQ,"From going undercover and making public the horrors of slaughterhouses and laboratories to delivering houses and straw to dogs in distress, ""I Am an Animal"" shows a seldom seen, behind-the-scenes look at PETA and Ms. Newkirk, who for more than 27 years have awakened hearts and minds to the other animals with whom we share this Earth, and invited us to make compassionate choices that value and respect all sentient beings, human and nonhuman alike.

8214443,5,B000UR9TJQ,"This is a documentary film about the radical tactics used by PETA to get its message across  which, in my opinion, are actually  necessary  taking into consideration  the reality of  a  lack of compassion for animals  in most people, although not in  everyone.

Apparently most human-people think  they have a  supposed  right to domesticate,  enslave, hunt, cage, chain, constraint,  mistreat, use for entertainment, restrain,  abuse, experiment on,  kill, cook and eat the ANIMAL-PEOPLE of all sorts, a wrong belief  responsible to certain extent for  keeping humanity in a hypnotic state of no-compassion.

That  and  WORSHIPING the so-called  PROTEIN  (which no one actually knows  what that  is)  are eradicating the  animal-people from the face of the earth and if the  destructive ""dominant species"" belief is  not healed and reversed  would  gradually  obliterate the human-people as well.

If there is indeed a balance of good and evil in the universe, as some metaphysicians claim, then Newkirk is a heavy-weight on the side of the angels. She has devoted most of her life to making us think about the conditions in which the rest of sentient life languishes, suffers and dies under the ""dominion"" of humanity.

This extraordinary look at Newkirk's life starts with her reading some of the foul, abusive correspondence which she receives every day from those who hate her for taking the covers off the mirrors and showing us as we are: sometimes callous, often greedy, usually apathetic. She and those who know her speak with total openness and candour of her background, methods and aims. PETA has a message about the inconsistency of our beliefs about what is ""normal"" - the way we love some animals and eat, wear or torment others. That message is so important that almost any means are justified in getting it heard, and PETA has pioneered media campaigns which have revolutionised advocacy, and which regularly get results against corporate interests with media budgets that would dwarf this not-for-profit organisation.
