4851639,5,B005OAEWV4,World Class Films: World of Birds was a Christmas gift but the recipient love it. Beautifully filmed birds and narration.,1360108800,4,121,5.1
4851640,5,B005OAEWV4,"This is excellent for those of us who love birds!  It is also great for others too.  I just watched my first one sitting at my computer.  You don't always have to watch DVDs on your TV.
It was excellent to sit and watch.  The photography, learning of the birds, sounds and the close up of the scenery was excellent!
One thing I got confused about is there are 8 DVDs and 11 films.  You have to read the DVDs to see that 3 of the DVDs have 2 of the films on them.
I thought 3 DVDs were missing until I read the front and saw that 3 had 2 films on them.
I had received all 11 films.  Remember to read the front of your DVDs.
This collection will take me around the world of birding which I've done for years.  Some places I hope to visit.",1359158400,12,736,3.8993288590604025
4851641,3,B005OAEWV4,"I was hoping for a more professional detailing of the birds being filmed...more detail on migration, habitat, identification, molting- but the films are filmed well, just the documentation is simple",1358035200,5,198,5.633333333333334
4851642,4,B005OAEWV4,"This worldwide collection of bird films features the avian life from countries such as Spain, France, Kenya, Australia, the United States and others.  Although it is advertised as a collection of films, some of the material was completed on video and then transferred to DVD.  There is much beautiful photography in the films and the films and the video closeups of the species are quite attractive. These are fine documentaries with a much information about the ecology of the regions in which the birds live.  Some of the birds included are eagles of the Iberian peninsula of Spain, the Cassowary of Australia, hummingbirds in North America, and the quelea, which has caused many problems in Africa by its overpopulation and damage to crops.  The ""Wild Wings"" program, hosted and narrated by Marty Stouffer, is also included in the ""Wild America Specials"" collection, available here at Amazon. It is such an excellent documentary that one can easily see why it was chosen for this world class collection of birds.  The narration of most of the films is quite appealing and easy to understand.  This set would make a fine gift for bird lovers of all ages.

Perhaps too much packaging was used in this collection.  The entire series could probably have been recorded on two or three DVD's instead of eight, making the package  much smaller and using less plastic and cardboard.  This would lessen the impact of the product's manufacture on the environment. However, I was pleased with the low price of the item, which will encourage more people to buy fine natural history films for their entertainment and educational value-- especially when they are so inexpensive.",1355443200,23,1667,4.985559566787003
4851643,5,B005OAEWV4,This group of videos is educational and indepth.  My favorite video is the one on owls.  The footage is beautiful and packed with information.  I was not disappointed in the least!,1349481600,13,180,4.741935483870968
4851644,4,B005OAEWV4,"This was a gift for my bird-loving 11 year old niece. She absolutely LOVES it! Her only complaint is of its evolutionary focus, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.",1338940800,3,170,4.181818181818182
4851645,4,B005OAEWV4,"Educational and an opportunity to bring a learning environment into your home. As with any documentary you have to  be careful of the verbiage because it crosses the lines of facts and biased fiction, good science and bad science.",1451606400,,230,4.897435897435898

4851655,5,B005OAEWV4,"WONDERFUL and diverse, this is quite an educational work of the wonder of birds around the world. There are species revealed here that were completely unknown to me before I viewed it. Beautifully filmed, wonderfully narrated and a most interesting set!",1418601600,2,253,5.195121951219512
4851656,2,B005OAEWV4,I think the dvds should be set to loop and I was hoping they would be a little more interesting. We love animals but my boys are not interested in this set at all.,1415664000,,163,3.823529411764706
4851657,3,B005OAEWV4,"A couple of these docs are incredible. Most look and feel like they came out of one of these birds' backsides. Pretty good for the price, tho. Makes decent hangover background.",1407715200,,176,4.709677419354839

4851659,2,B005OAEWV4,Wanted to watch the beauty of birds and there were some of this. One was about an over population of bird and how they were trapping them with nets to minims them. Another showed how one type of bird nesting has to protect there eggs or young from other bird that would come and eat them. I was very disappointed in this set and therefore have not even finished watching all the the videos.,1395100800,2,390,4.283783783783784
4851660,1,B005OAEWV4,"This box set contains a variety of DVDs based on programs taken from what seems to be a diversity of sources and none of them distinguished.  The photography is mostly a joke.  The scripted commentary is mostly devoid of useful facts and frequently degenerates into nothing more than a portrait gallery as in ""then we have this bird, then we have that bird, etc""
The narration is truly atrocious.  Who can really stand to hear a professional voice person say ""camayflaaj"" for camouflage 35 times in one DVD?

Skip this set.",1391126400,11,523,4.714285714285714

4851662,1,B005OAEWV4,"When I check this product which I liked it very much, I bought it because it was indicated that has english subtitles.  Even I am from a spanish speaking language, I do understand written english.  When I received it I realised that there are no subtitles.
I am very dissapointed.",1379030400,,280,4.58
4851663,4,B005OAEWV4,"These are beautiful films and I enjoy ""watching"" them.  I am hearing impaired and bought this pakage because Amazon's product details indicates that it has English Subtitles.  BEWARE:  these are not subtitled and the only reason I am keeping them is that my grandchildren will eventually enjoy them.  I buy only subtitled or CC'd movies and think that Amazon needs to be more careful in this area.  None of the pakaging indicates that they are subtitled!",1376784000,6,454,4.921052631578948
4851664,4,B005OAEWV4,"Some of the films are rather short, but informative.

BBC Programmes tend to be better, e.g; "" the life of birds "" by Sir David attenborough.",1369612800,6,141,4.423076923076923
