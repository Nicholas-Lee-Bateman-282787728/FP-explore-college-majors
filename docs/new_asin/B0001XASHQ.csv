8017827,1,B0001XASHQ,"NONE of the three discs work on any device... i tried DVD (3 different kind) Blueray player and home computer that plays DVD's ... NOTTA!
bought as a xmas gift back in Oct.  not realizing that i should have opened and tried to play them prior to see if they work...wouldn't think anyone would have to do such, lesson learned.  the longest ""file"" on disc one shows 7 seconds and i'm pretty sure Fleetwood Mac had songs longer than 7 seconds!  Not at all happy with this outcome as the person i gave this too as a gift is a huge fan and was excited to watch them...",1422835200,,563,4.194444444444445

8017829,1,B0001XASHQ,"The DVD ""Fleetwood Mac:  Live in Boston"" wouldn't play on my DVD.  All I got was a message that said,  ""Cannot play this disc.  Video format does not meet required video format of this product.  Disc purchased from abroad may not be playable.""  The order ID # was 112-83448800-8384222 and the Amazon Return ID was  DDzkqXpQRRMA.  I went through the hassle of sending it back to ""Deep Discount"" in Irvine, CA.  I live in California!!!  Why would I be sent a DVD that can only play in Europe or Asia???  This really soured my interest in going through Amazon to buy ANYTHING from you guys!!!  A class-act would be for you to send me the DVD ""Fleetwood Mac:  Live in Boston""  free of charge.
