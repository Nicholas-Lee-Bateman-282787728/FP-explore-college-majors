8677072,4,B00NAZ2FUU,"This is a little known Slasher from Spain. The good and the bad news is It's very formulaic ,The story begins showing a young boy being locked  in a boiler room on April Fools Day. He's burned to death in a relatively graphic way on screen by a bunch of stupid jokesters.

Then  we have the flash forward to a group of teens going to stay at an abandoned Hostel/Hotel for sex and partying.

The film is only a little over an hour long so the killing and action starts quick. The kills are somewhat creative,ranging from a car full of bees to slashing  and the effects are pretty good.

It's quite predictable but I still enjoyed it and would probably watch it again. The acting as very solid and pulls it together nicely.

This one plays it straight,no comic relief. But it works. Again,the ending was predictable and will make most people a little angry! Not because it was boring because it truly was not.

All in all it's a solid little indie Slasher.",1442448000,,954,4.411428571428571
