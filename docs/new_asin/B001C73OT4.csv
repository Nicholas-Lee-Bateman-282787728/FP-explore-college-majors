I cannot find enough words to satisfy the requirement for a minimum number in order to send, so have to fill in with meaningless nothings.  Why not change this?  Less is better.",1393027200,,289,4.74
8286206,2,B001C73OT4,"The package says blu-ray. It's on a blu-ray disc. But it's not the quality that one would expect from a blu-ray. It wasn't mastered for high def. It might look good on an antiquated standard definition TV. But on a high def TV you get a clear view of its fuzziness.

A waste of money.",1343952000,6,284,4.163636363636364
8286207,2,B001C73OT4,"Thought this would be up to par with National Geographic but was real low end. First the video quality was real bad for 1080P.

I would swear I saw interpolated(not true 1080p)many scenes all through, grainy etc. Once in while some was good. Then the video scenes> Clouds? Who wants to waste time with shots of clouds? To me this was a poor way to make a product and say blu-ray ready...
You can find better elseware.......

8286208,5,B001C73OT4,"This DVD was truly a feast for the senses. I loved every minute of the pristine serenity and ambiance this video had given.

 The real joy was in actually leaving the natural sounds on, and listening to it on the home theater. You really do feel that you're actually there.

 This is a must buy for people who are so busy in life, that we neglect the vast beauty out there.",1256083200,,373,4.211267605633803
8286209,1,B001C73OT4,"I had a grat expectations abut this title... But... The video is definitely not HD - it's blurry and SD (upconverted).

The ""plot"" is quite boring, nothing special and breath-taking. This movie has nothing in common with ""Planet Earth"" or ""Earth"". Waste of time and money.",1247961600,20,272,4.913043478260869
8286210,2,B001C73OT4,"Bought from Amazon for about $10.00 and it is worth about $5.00.  Based on the reputation of National Geographic I thought the image would be outstanding, I was wrong. I don't think it even qualifies as a good SD upconvert.
Planet Earth it is not!",1247097600,25,247,4.488888888888889
8286211,2,B001C73OT4,"First off, I NEVER write reviews, but felt I needed to in this case. This blu-ray is so bad I literally took a look at the disc to make sure I wasn't sent the DVD version. The content I rate 3 stars given my family enjoyed it (including my 3 year old) but I have DVDs that look better upconverted than this film. When the  best part of the HD experience is the dolby digital track (which is standard on DVDs) you know it's a stinker. The  show looks so compressed and blurry its embarrassing to be considered hi-def. It wasn't even worth the $10 I paid for it during high definition week. Which I'm now officially convinced was 'clean out the garage and have a hi-def sale' week.

Since it looks like a dvd, and sounds like a DVD....I'm going to say you are getting a DVD in blu-ray packaging. If anyone is wondering, I have over 150 blu-rays, and I'm going to say this is the worst one  I own.

The production value is horrible, at about the 30 minute mark, it pauses for about 3 seconds, I was thinking....is it over? Maybe it IS a dvd and I'm experiencing a layer change? It then goes into the next segment. It's all a little cheesy but relaxing. They could have done so much more with it though.

Bottom-line, save your money or buy the DVD version.",1245110400,37,1253,4.243697478991597
