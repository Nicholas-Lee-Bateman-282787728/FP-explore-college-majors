8096501,4,B000C9TM1M,"This movie depicts the worst things that can happen to the underprivileged youth who leave their Indian reservation in order to find a better life in the big city. How are you going to pay the rent? With petty crime and prostitution comes drug abuse - after all, you need some illegal substances to endure those hardships.

Excellent acting. I wish these First Nation/Native American actors could get a foot in the door in Hollywood. There's hardly any roles for them. Even the Native actors who were in ""Twilight"" don't seem to be very busy these days. It's a shame. I really don't know why all the movie heroes and villains still have to be lily-white...",1377129600,,656,4.655172413793103

8096503,4,B000C9TM1M,"While definitely not a big-budget production, ""On the Corner"" has the proper respect for both the characters and the desperate situations in which they find themselves.  Bleak, but not mirthless, the film shows the real dangers of a life on the street (even in Vancouver).",1304553600,2,272,5.044444444444444
