575141,4,6303150896,"Not exactly what I thought the item would be, the television series, not a movie, never the less, very enjoyable. To me, Eve Arden was a true comedian, one of the better ones on TV at that time.",1305158400,2,194,4.131578947368421
575142,3,6303150896,"No surprises here.  Just a fun typical Our Miss Brooks story, and done as always, well and happily with Eve Arden suffering over Mr Boynton.  A bit of fun nostalgia for those of us who were ""there"" when it happened.",1272672000,10,215,4.35
575143,5,6303150896,"If your a romantic at heart you'll love this one, don't forget the funny bone.",1268006400,3,78,4.266666666666667
575144,5,6303150896,"To the reviewer who said there wasn't enough detailed information about this DVD, if you read the product description, it indicates that this is the motion picture based on the series & not episodes from the tv show.

Nick Adams & Don Porter are cast as father & son in this film.  Overall, a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half.  Mr. Boynton is so loveable ;-)",1265760000,10,366,4.27536231884058
575145,5,6303150896,I REMEMBER GROWING UP AND MY MOTHER WATCHING THIS. I TOO WATCHED. I WAS SO SHOCKED TO SEE THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE. WE ALL LOVE IT.,1179014400,8,128,3.9615384615384617
575146,4,6303150896,"This 98 minute film starts out on How Miss Brooks comes to a new city to teach at Madison High and introduces us to the characters that were featured on radio and television from 1948 and on, thus a good introduction to people unfamilar with the 30 minute radio/television comedy.
It keeps the character traits and comedy of the radio/TV series and introduces a bit of drama that would not be out of touch with today. It shows Ms. Arden's underrated dramatic acting talents in this way.
I doubt any updated modern film version the series would be just as good
If one had never seen the TV/Radio series and judges it as just a movie, it would be a very good family film, if the children were of the grade 5 to 13 age.",1046476800,17,716,4.311111111111111
575147,5,6303150896,I found this movie to be very good and very entertaining as well.  Eve Arden was great in it.  It has everything from comedy to romance.  It's a film the entire family can watch.,1009756800,10,178,4.176470588235294
575227,5,6303150896,"The movie is classic and is Eve Arden at her best.  If you like the oldies, you'll love this!.",1429056000,,94,3.9473684210526314
575228,5,6303150896,This is a great high quality transfer.,1424217600,,38,4.571428571428571
575229,5,6303150896,"This is the feature film version of the beloved radio and television series. It has the very same cast, writers and director of same, and is, as such, a satisfying trip down memory lane for the series fans. This feature adds some heart interest and drama to the comedy, and features Don Porter
and Nick Adams as a wealthy newspaper publisher and his son. Even Minerva, the cat belonging to dotty landlady Mrs. Davis is present. The print is beautiful and all in all, this is great for those nostalgic for the series, readily available in it's radio incarnation, but scarce as hen's teeth in the TV version. There are indications that the TV show is being digitally remastered for a possible new syndication and/or DVD release, but that may still be off in the future.",1422748800,,767,4.647058823529412
575230,2,6303150896,"I love the radio and TV show it always cracks me up and I laugh outlaid. , The movie is too serious and not all that funny. I didn't laugh once during the entire movie. I love Eve Arden, but they gave her a horrible script. That's surprising since Al Lewis wrote the script. There wasn't even much of her signature sarcasm that she's known for. I feel like I wasted $15.00.",1420848000,,373,4.194444444444445
575231,5,6303150896,Love the clean humor Eve Arden always brought to the screen. Reminded me of the respect people had for themselves and others when I was growing up.,1412467200,5,147,4.481481481481482
575232,3,6303150896,"Eve Arden was wonderful in just about everything she performed in and the television series ""Our Miss Brooks"" was a major highlight in her career and a wonderful situation comedy from 1952 through 1956.  This film version was made at the end of the series and is a nice keepsake  for fans of the actors and the characters they portrayed.  To be fair the film does struggle to turn a half hour sit-com into a full-length movie and despite having the wonderful talents of Arden, Gale Gordon, Richard Crenna and  the rest of the tv cast on board provides just average entertainment.  A major subplot featuring newspaper tycoon Don Porter (who fancies Arden) and wayward son Nick Adams works quite well but does throw up the puzzle why Miss Brooks is so enamored  with Robert Rockwell's rather dopey Philip Boynton. Still, anything featuring Ms. Arden is worth watching and the film is good fun and the quality of this print made on demand from the Warner Archive Collection is excellent.",1407369600,3,984,4.758823529411765

575235,5,6303150896,Our Miss Brooks  PArt one is a smash. It is to bad the entire series from televlsion is not avaliable on VHS. Eve Arden is the perfect teacher. Where was she when I was in High School. This is a family movie-G rated!,1355184000,,216,4.023255813953488
575236,4,6303150896,A fun trip down memory lane-Eve Arden seemed very sophisticated to me when I was a school girl & I remember wishing my school had teachers just like her.  We already had a principal just like Mr. Conklin!,1325894400,5,204,4.368421052631579

7839358,4,6303150896,"Eve Arden's wise cracking style was very enjoyable, and her Connie Brooks character was a perfect outlet for it, and quickly became a beloved 'classic'. This movie version, made just after the series finished is O.K. has some of the same charm as the long running series, but not enough to give the same satisfaction, and just make you wish someone would remaster and release the full series in all it's glory! Thankfully all the favourites from the show are here, the great Gale Gordon, Robert Rockwell, young Richard Crenna, Jane Morgan are all there! Fun from a nicer Era!",1458777600,4,575,4.76
