8538199,3,B0099VUTFM,"OK mid-to-late sixties, Euro-made, dubbed into English spy film, on the cusp of the MOD era.  Some of the women's fashion confirm this.  Watchable, with my favorite Tarzan actor. Gordon Scott.  The picture is not bad and the color is nice.  I bought the Mr. Fat-W DVD release via Movies Unlimited and I was disappointed.  Movies Unlimited did their job correctly, but the DVD producer screwed up.  Twice, partway through the film there is overlapping dialogue from another film altogether.  Also the movie is missing the ending.  It stops abruptly.  The movie itself I recommend for fans of mid-sixties Euro spy films, but I cannot recommend this particular DVD release.",1389571200,2,670,5.0181818181818185

8538201,1,B0099VUTFM,"Picked this up as an MST3K fan - I was curious what the unedited version of the movie was like.  I knew that as a manufactured on demand movie from a little known DVD company I shouldn't expect much, but the END OF THE MOVIE IS MISSING!  There is a good two minutes missing from the end of this DVD (fans of the just-released MST3K version will back me up on this) - the scene after the laboratory is destroyed and super-spy Bart Fargo tosses is wrist-watch/two-way radio out the window when his bosses try to call him back home is entirely missing.  Beyond that, the transfer's not that bad looking.  Would be great if a cleaned up version in its original widescreen were to be released - the movie itself is cheezy fun.  Just a shame that this DVD doesn't contain the whole movie.",1365897600,6,782,4.36551724137931
