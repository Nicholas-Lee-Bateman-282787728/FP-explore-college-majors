8590664,5,B00006JDRN,"The original Hang Kong version of ""Aces go Places 3"" and  dubbed ""Mad mission 3"" are totally diffrent movies! Watching the first I was in laughing stitches. Watching the second I was in tears thinking how one can spoil such an excelent comedy. Censored and horribly cut ""Mad mission 3"" is a pale shadow of ""Aces go Places 3"". Before you order, ask what they want to sell you.",1146700800,,375,4.434782608695652
8590665,5,B00006JDRN,"I have been trying to get a copy of this movie for at least 15 years now and the fact that it is now coming out on DVD is why I love this format . The movie is a funny spoof of spy movies with amazing action and truly one of a kind gadgets . The series also has a famous villian in every installment , in this one it is sean connery as james bond (or at least a lookalike) . Also Peter Graves (the real one) appears as his mission impossible character . This movie is for kids and adults alike and especially for fans of spys and gadgets . I won't be buying it but only because I am buying the whole collection .",1031788800,,612,3.826771653543307
