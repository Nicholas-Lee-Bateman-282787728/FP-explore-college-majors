7987414,2,B00008W2TT,"It looks like Bulldog (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket. One of the wedding gifts is an artificial or man made diamond. Naturally this is seen by a diamond mine owner, Sir Raymond Blantyre (Matthew Boulton.) He realized his economy is in peril. The diamond and Sir Raymond go missing and there is a body left behind. It does not take long to figure how what happened. From here things get crossed and double crossed. There are explosive scenes and goofy chase scenes. Col. Neilson (John Barrymore) of Scotland Yard is after Captain Drummond for his indiscretions and only confuses things.

The whole film is pretty much Drummond formula (screen play by Stuart Palmer and based on ""The Third Round"" by H.C. (Snapper) McNeile) but there is no spark among the characters or satisfaction in the chases or discoveries or conclusions.",1512086400,,891,4.94

7987417,4,B00008W2TT,"I rate BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S PERIL 3.5 out of 5 stars. BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S PERIL, like all other Bulldog Drummond fare from this era, believes in brevity. This one, released in 1938, runs 66 minutes only and unfolds a plot what's true to its B-movie aesthetic. It's based on H.C. ""Sapper"" McNeile's novel, THE THIRD ROUND. It embroils our dashing ex-captain of Her Majesty's Air Force in zany skullduggery concerning sham diamonds and homicidal scientists and gemologists.

The movie begins in familiar fashion, with Bulldog (John Howard) and his indulgent fiance, Phyllis Clavering (Louise Campbell), on the cusp of getting married. This time out, the wedding's set to take place in Geneva, Switzerland. There, in an elegant chateau, the happy couple may be glimpsed scoping out their heap of wedding presents or as Bulldog refers to them: ""the loot."" And while I don't know that anything beats Bulldog's dimbulb pal Algy's gift - which is a penguin! - for sheer idiosyncrasy, what Prof. Bernard Goodman (Halliwell Hobbes) offers them is pretty out there: a synthetic diamond so undetectable it could pass for genuine bling. And Prof. Goodman's got big news. He intends to make the process of it public domain.

Imagine the repercussions, how such a game-changing formula could compromise the diamond market and international economics. So maybe you could empathize with Sir Raymond (Matthew Boulton), dastardly head of the metropolitan diamond syndicate, for absconding with the precious rock. Less empathy should be given for his being responsible for that detective's corpse found under the table.

John Howard keeps on being that steady presence. Sure, his stature isn't as towering as Ronald Colman's, who also played Bulldog, but I figure his inhabiting this role nine times in three years gives him a certain cachet. He convinces as the dapper English toff and as the decisive man-of-action. See him rush off to play cops & robbers, much to the ire of the long-suffering Phyllis. See him crack this case and pierce a cunning piece of trickery and put the kibosh not only on the dastardly Sir Raymond but also on insiduous rival scientist Dr. Botulian (Porter Hall). See him engage in a duel of saber versus bullwhip. See him stand unfazed and cool as the other side of the pillow even as the rancor of Scotland Yard Commissioner, Colonel Nielsen (John Barrymore), washes over him (this was before Nielsen became Bulldog's staunch ally and close friend). Note that John Barrymore, in his second of three times playing this role, nabs top billing, and there's some fun in eyeballing the Great Profile as he blusters around, lending color to the proceedings. And, okay, see Captain Drummond match fellow B-movie adventurer, the Falcon, in pathetic attempts at matrimony. There's the invaluable manservant Tenny (E.E. Clive) getting into the mix as usual, getting captured on purpose and purposely crashing the car, all to further his boss's investigation. But you must forgive even an action butler like Tenny for being out of sorts moments after the car crash and striking such a querulous tone: ""Taxi! Taxi? Voiture!"" (a continuation of a running gag that made me smile). Listen, these Bulldog Drummond pulp adventures aren't prestige projects. They were made to cater to common folk like you and me. But there's a reason there's a pretty sizable body of films about this character. These films are no-fuss, straight-up entertainers. There's a continuity in characters and humor that is self-aware and vigor in the pacing and enough intrigue to sate the young and young at heart. You know you're in for a diverting time when the English guy informs his butler: ""You better stay within call with a revolver.""",1445990400,,3710,5.078688524590164
7987418,4,B00008W2TT,"Routine programmers but John Barrymore's presence makes both films worth viewing.  Reasonably good plots and acting from an enthusiastic
cast.  London is the setting as Hugh Drummond solves two mysteries with the assist of his supervisor (Barrymore).  The train escapade is the better of the two.  However, both films hold your attention and move quickly.",1426118400,,355,5.4
7987419,5,B00008W2TT,"A fine Bulldoy Drummond movie. And a great plot  with actors playing A parts even though they called them B movies. Add 10 minutes to this movie and you have an A movie. I think during this time of movie making those who made movies came up with the B movies in order to pay the actors less while producing a great movie and giving them more money and the actors less of same. The last laugh for these movie makers of B and A movies came from many of the actors. Many of them, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Lucille Ball and so many more went off to TV and made millions. Good for them. As for this movie you have a fine plot and the best actors who made a fine movie.",1410912000,2,664,3.955223880597015

The story begins with cars on a road in London England. There is a notice about a wedding in Switzerland. [Note how Blanche uses that camera.] The gift of a large man-made diamond is a threat to the diamond cartel. Can it be stolen? ""No home is complete without one."" They find the detective hired to watch the gifts under a table! Would a man of wealth and position stoop to stealing? [How did he gain his wealth?] The ability to manufacture diamonds would destroy the value of real diamonds and the value of their company stock. Will this investigation interfere with the wedding? We see how they hide a diamond in a book. Hugh sends a cablegram to Neilson, who treats it as a joke. Can Hugh, Algy, and Tenny quickly fly to England? But there is zero visibility! Can Hugh land safely?

Sir Raymond Blantyre visits the scientist who manufactured the artificial diamond; he repeats the process. Professor Goodman plans to reveal the process to the public. This will result in a great loss for the diamond industry! [You know where this is going.] They offer a large sum for the exclusive rights to this process, a monopoly patent. But he refuses. Will this put him in great danger? It can affect the British Empire! Blantyre offers first 5,000 then 50,000! Will there be a double-cross? Later Hugh shows up. Tenny sees what happened, and follows the truck. Botulian shows up shows up and is accused of being there earlier. Botulian visits Hugh and gets Goodman's notes. Later Hugh visits Botulian to see Professor Goodman, and is captured. Where are they kept? Hugh's friends search all over. They escape, then Hugh must return to rescue Phyllis. There is a struggle, Hugh wins. Colonel Neilson arrives with the police to sort things out. Sir Raymond is taken into custody to be sent back to Switzerland for questioning. Somehow, the great damage to the diamond cartel will be averted.

Industrial grade diamonds are very important in manufacturing, but few know the details. This story is set in England but filmed in Hollywood. Hugh and Tenny seem derived from Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. Note how the right to keep and bear arms was respected in Britain until 1946.",1289174400,,2214,4.760416666666667
