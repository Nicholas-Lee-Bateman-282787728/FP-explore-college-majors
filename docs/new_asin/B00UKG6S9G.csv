8707189,5,B00UKG6S9G,"Peggy Dow is drop-dead gorgeous!  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc lasts 100s of years.

Peggy Dow, a promising 1950s Universal contract player had so much going for her -- beauty, brains and talent.  Unfortunately, she decided to retire for domestic life.  They just don't make them like Peggy Dow anymore.

Undertow was directed by the legendary William Castle. William Castle was the basis for the 1993 movie ""Matinee"".  If I could only own 10 movies, ""Matinee"" would be one of them.

I highly recommend ""Undertow"" a terrific whodunit thriller with ample eye candy.  Happy to have this in my Blu-ray/DVD collection.",1481500800,3,921,4.915584415584416
