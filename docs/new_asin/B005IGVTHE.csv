Back in 2005 a pretty good New York Dolls DVD came out called All Dolled Up. It was made from extensive black and white footage of the band Nadya Beck and Bob Gruen shot in the 1970s. It captured the Dolls on-stage and off, giving viewers a candid look at life in one of rocks most compelling groups. Six years later, we get another Dolls DVD; this one called Lookin Fine On Television, which is just that same footage re-edited into music videos to accompany the live audio tracks Beck and Gruen recorded with their camera. If repurposed footage sounds like a redundant waste of time to you, thats most likely because it is. How similar are these two DVDs? They even have the same image of the back cover! The only cool part of the package is a bonus interview with a seemingly drunk David Johansen and Johnny Thunders in front of CBGBs in 1976. Given the 35 years of musical history thats gone down since the interview, its funny to hear Thunders talking rather nonchalantly about his upcoming tour with a group called the Sex Pistols and about how he might change his bands name from The Heartbreakers because of some new band called Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. Outside of those brief moments, theres nothing about Lookin Fine thats worth your money.",1451433600,3,1327,4.769565217391304

8474693,3,B005IGVTHE,"This is an odd little DVD. It's the New York Dolls; a live recording of the Dolls has been used as the soundtrack for this DVD, while the video consists of b/w  cuts from a dozen or more live performances with Johaneson's singing synched to the various video tracks, which are of tremendously varying quality (from somewhat watchable to terrible). Really, I wish they'd give us each of these shows in full length with whatever sound they may have,  and I wish that one of their greatest TV performances, on ""Don Kirchner's Rock Concert"" would finally see release.",1383350400,4,563,4.73469387755102
8474694,4,B005IGVTHE,"This New York Dolls video looks rough, washed-out in places and gritty. It's shot in full-screen and it's all in black and white. It looks like it may have been recovered from a nasty trash can on lower 42nd street. You can almost smell the decay coming from it. You know what? For the New York Dolls, that's a compliment, and all of these things I've mentioned just make the film more endearing to the fans.

Interspersed between each song we get an interview snippet from members of the band. While not much light is shed on them from these little gems, you can hear the decadence of 1970's New York in their voices, their comments, and you can see it in their faces. They were a band that was made for the clubs of New York. Imagine if the Rolling Stones had formed as a loud rock/punk act in the dirty clubs of the area, and you have yourself a good idea of what the Dolls are. Lead singer David Johansen is practically a Mick Jagger clone. Big lips, big attitude, and big voice. Let's take a look at their Wikipedia entry to find out the bands history.

[Wikipedia]
Sylvain Sylvain and Billy Murcia, who went to junior high school and high school together, started playing in a band called ""the Pox"" in 1967. After the frontman quit, Murcia and Sylvain started a clothing business called ""Truth and Soul"" and Sylvain took a job at ""A Different Drummer"", a men's boutique that was across the street from the New York Doll Hospital, a doll repair shop. Sylvain claimed that the shop inspired the name for their future band. In 1970 they formed a band again and recruited Johnny Thunders to join on bass, though Sylvain ended up teaching him to play guitar. They called themselves the ""Dolls."" When Sylvain left the band to spend a few months in London, Thunders and Murcia went their separate ways.

Thunders was eventually recruited by Kane and Rick Rivets, who had been playing together in the Bronx. At Thunders' suggestion, Murcia replaced the original drummer. Thunders played lead guitar and sang for the band known as ""Actress"". An October 1971 rehearsal tape recorded by Rivets was released as Dawn of the Dolls. When Thunders decided that he no longer wanted to be the front man, David Johansen joined the band.

Initially, the group was composed of singer David Johansen, guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets (who was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain after a few months), bass guitarist Arthur ""Killer"" Kane and drummer Billy Murcia. The original lineup's first performance was on Christmas Eve 1971 at a homeless shelter, the Endicott Hotel.

The band was influenced by vintage rhythm and blues, the early Rolling Stones, classic American girl group songs, and protopunk bands such as the MC5 and The Stooges, as well as glam rockers such as Marc Bolan. In synthesizing this wide variety of influences they created something which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote ""doesn't really sound like anything that came before it. It's hard rock with a self-conscious wit, a celebration of camp and kitsch that retains a menacing, malevolent edge."" The band's sound was also influenced by blues and soul, as evidenced by Johansen's blues harmonica and their choice of cover versions. Their two Mercury albums contain their covers of songs originally performed by Bo Diddley, The Drells, Sonny Boy Williamson, The Coasters and the Jay Hawks. The CD ""Private World: The Complete Early Studio Demos 1972/3"" includes their versions of songs by Otis Redding, Gary US Bonds, Chuck Berry, The Shangri-Las and Muddy Waters. The jazz influence was particularly important for Johansen, whose subsequent career included work with jazz man Big Jay McNeely and blues man Hubert Sumlin. Johansen is an accomplished trumpet player.

After getting a manager and attracting some music industry interest, the New York Dolls got a break when Rod Stewart invited them to open for him at a London concert. Shortly thereafter, Murcia died of accidental drowning, at age 21, after he passed out from drugs and alcohol.

Once back in New York, the Dolls auditioned drummers, including Marc Bell (who would go on to play with Richard Hell and Ramones under the stage name ""Marky Ramone"") and Jerry Nolan, a friend of the band. They selected Nolan, and after US Mercury Records' A&R man Paul Nelson signed them, they began sessions for their debut album. New York Dolls was produced by former The Nazz guitarist Todd Rundgren, who had become a successful pop singer and producer, with his #5 Billboard hit, Hello It's Me. In an interview in Creem magazine, Rundgren says he barely touched the recording; everybody was debating how to do the mix. Sales were sluggish, especially in middle US, and a Stereo Review magazine reviewer in 1973 compared the Dolls' guitar playing to the sound of lawnmowers.
New York Dolls in 1973

America's mass rock audience's reaction to the Dolls was mixed. In a Creem magazine poll, they were elected both best and worst new group of 1973. The Dolls also toured Europe, and, while appearing on UK television, host Bob Harris of the BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test derided the group as ""mock rock,"" comparing them unfavorably to the Rolling Stones.

For their next album, Too Much Too Soon, the quintet hired producer George ""Shadow"" Morton, whose productions for the Shangri-Las and other girl-groups in the mid-1960s had been among the band's favorites. Mercury dropped the Dolls not long after the second album. In 1975, foundering in drug abuse and interpersonal conflicts, the band split up. During their last weeks together Malcolm McLaren helped with management. He got the band red leather outfits to wear on stage and a communist flag as backdrop. The Dolls did a 5-concert tour of New York - one gig for each New York district - supported by new band Television that included Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. Their last show in New York was at The Shoram, in Quogue, New York, with Spider on drums.

The McLaren-era Dolls were captured in a live set released by Fan Club records in 1982, Red Patent Leather. Production is credited to Sylvain Sylvain, with former manager Marty Thau credited as executive producer. Due to Kane being unable to play that night, roadie Peter Jordan played bass and was credited with having played ""second bass"". Jordan had played with the Dolls often, when Kane was too inebriated to play. He was the Dolls' bass player after Thunders and Nolan left, until their final dissolution.

The sound on this disc is a fairly rough mono. While this would be substandard in most cases, it seems to fit with the Dolls image, and I wouldn't expect it any other way. What they lacked in talent they more than made up with in attitude and just plain guts. They were they kind of band that could make aspiring musicians think, ""If they can do it, I'll have a shot too"". The video looks as if it might have been taken from several different early career shows. Here's the tracklisting for the DVD.

1. Jet Boy
2. Personality Crisis
3. Human Being
4. Bad Detective
5. Subway Train
6. Trash
7. Vietnamese Baby
8. Lookin' For A Kiss
9. Who Are The Mystery Girls
10. Private World
11. Babylon
12. Frankenstein
13. Chatterbox
14. Jet Boy

As a bonus extra, you get an ultra rare 1976 interview with David Johansen and Johnny Thunders by Lisa Robinson.

Grab this hot and sweaty concert while you can. You'll be feeling dirty after the show!

8474696,4,B005IGVTHE,"Victor Valdivia, DVD Verdict --It's crude, lo-fi, difficult to look at and listen to, and thoroughly unpolished. Which, of course, is exactly why you should see it as a true representation of the New York Dolls. This was a band that made its reputation in the early '70s as one of the crudest, rawest, most ramshackle rock 'n' roll outfits of the era, and you'll get no better idea of just how ferocious they were live than this DVD collection.

Lookin' Fine on Television compiles videotaped performances from the New York Dolls from various concerts in 1973 and 1974. Singer David Johansen, guitarists Johnny Thunders and Sylvain Sylvain, bassist Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, and drummer Jerry Nolan perform these songs:

* ""Lookin' for a Kiss""
* ""Babylon""
* ""Trash""
* ""Bad Detective""
* ""Vietnamese Baby""
* ""Bad Girl""
* ""Chatterbox""
* ""Human Being""
* ""Private World""
* ""Subway Train""
* ""Personality Crisis""
* ""Frankenstein""
* ""Who Are the Mystery Girls?""
* ""Jet Boy""

These are early-'70s videotapes, which means black-and-white video and very grainy and fuzzy video at that. Similarly, the sound quality is less than stellar. The disc comes with stereo and 5.1 surround mixes (although there are no menu options to choose one; you'll have to use your ""audio"" button to cycle between them), and both are fairly rough. The surround mix does sound ""fuller"" but the stereo mix sounds closer to what the original quality is, so in many ways the sound quality is a bit of a wash. Back then, videotape was in its infancy and lacked the quality of film, but was at least cheaper. For a struggling band like the Dolls (who only released two albums, neither of which sold particularly well), it was an ideal way to catalogue their live shows.

The live shows are the reason to patiently endure the less-than-optimal quality. Sure, the Dolls were never superstars, and imploded due to drugs and financial problems after barely two albums, New York Dolls (1973) and Too Much Too Soon (1974). Those two albums, however, changed the face of music significantly. The punk movement that emerged at the end of the decade owed everything to the Dolls' music; bands like the Sex Pistols and The Smiths flatly stated they would not have existed without the Dolls. Similarly, the wave of glam-metal artists that emerged in the '80s, such as Mtley Cre and Poison, owe much to the Dolls' fusion of glam theatrics and three-chord stomp.

You can hear that influence in these recordings, which, although not of sterling quality, still show the band at its peak. Thunders' snarling guitar, Johansen's sneering vocals, Nolan's pummeling backbeat--this is the sound of modern hard rock in its infancy, delivered in a series of live performances that are not consistent (they wouldn't be exciting if they were) but thrilling in their unevenness. There are no notes about when and where these songs were recorded, and some of the video performances are not complete (though the audio is), so there are random shots of interview footage scattered throughout, but even with this little information, you can still get a feel of just what it was like to see the Dolls back then. Shot by photographer Bob Gruen and his wife Nadya, these recordings, along with the band's two albums and incidental demos and live tracks that have leaked out throughout the years, are all that remains of the original Dolls' legacy, but they are well worth the investment. Even the disc's sole extra, ""Interview with David Johansen and Johnny Thunders"" (8:32), is worth seeing. It's a chat between the two musicians from 1976, after the Dolls had disbanded, in front of the legendary punk club CBGBs, discussing their solo careers. It's probably the only time the two were together after the band's breakup, and it's fascinating to see.

Lookin' Fine on Television, then, is a must. Though Johansen and Sylvain, the only two surviving members of the Dolls (the others having passed on years ago), have put together a new version of the band with new supporting players, it's this classic lineup that changed rock music with their music and theatrics. If you can withstand the video and audio quality, you'll get to see one of the best and most influential bands in their prime onstage. Newcomers might want to start with the music first, but once they do, they'll want to watch this collection.

8474697,5,B005IGVTHE,"Although I'm a longtime fan, I've seen relatively little footage of the Dolls live in action from their vintage glory days. Consequently, for me, this was a real treat. The often grainy black and white videography only enhances the band's infamous garage-type image. In fact, had the production been any slicker, it would have likely diminished their mystique. I found the behind-the-scenes bits and interview segments, particularly Lisa Robinson's poolside interviews with David and Johnny to be revealing and insightful. In short, I'm more than satisfied with this one!

8474698,3,B005IGVTHE,"I'm wondering what the difference is (if any) between this new release of Bob Gruen's (bless his heart) and his last one. Hopefully not more grainy, distant muddy-audio footage! That was cool for a start when there was nothing else to choose from. Let's hope this has some of the undeniably cool TV appearances from their post-Murcia days!! From the description, it sounds like a lot of the same stuff we've already seen (the live stuff, the pool interviews, etc.) If it IS the same old same old, then dammit, let's smash down the doors of the vaults and let the gems be released. I'd hate to see Bob tryin' to drain more blood from the same old stone...between his book(s) and his last Dolls DVD, he'd risk becoming nothing more than repetitious. And THAT would be a shame!
