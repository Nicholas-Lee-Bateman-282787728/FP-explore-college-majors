1890752,2,B00009V7QU,I didn't like the condition it was sent in. The DVD in my mind shouldn't have been sent if it were that badly scratched. It's hard to revive it and it's not my son's choice because of how badly it skips. The casing was poor and there was no insert either.,1388880000,,255,4.019607843137255
1890753,5,B00009V7QU,"My grandson has to have everything Thomas. He likes this dvd and asks to watch it as soon as he get's up in the morning. I however would like to have a grand daughter to add in with these 6 grandsons, Thomas has become one of my less desired toy lines as of late :)",1374796800,,265,3.8363636363636364
1890754,5,B00009V7QU,"Our Grandson is a ""Dyed in the Wool"" Thomas & Friends fan. He really enjoys Thomas videos, books, trains & track accessories. He couldn't wait to unwrap this Video. He seems to enjoy it as he plays it often.",1369526400,,207,4.333333333333333
1890755,5,B00009V7QU,My kid loves these fun filled videos. They are full of adventure and mischief that the trains get into.this video is for the toddler train lover in your life.,1368748800,,158,4.482758620689655
1890766,3,B00009V7QU,My son like it but he is used to seeing the more recent Thomas animations. I will be sure to order a more recent Thomas video next time.,1366588800,,136,3.892857142857143

1890769,1,B00009V7QU,"Bought this specifically for the gold thomas, but apparently toy varies then what is pictured. I am sending it back.",1357344000,,116,4.85
1890770,5,B00009V7QU,"It's nice to have a ""wintry"" set of episodes that aren't necessarily holiday themed. All of the episodes on this dvd have snow: love it!",1355097600,,136,4.48
1890771,5,B00009V7QU,"Case was in good condition, as well as the disk.  As is with all Thomas & Friends movies, this one had a good story and message!",1353974400,,128,3.923076923076923
1890772,2,B00009V7QU,"I purchased this after previewing the video on the product page. It also says it is from 2009. Neither of these are true. This video is from 2003 before CGI was used in Thomas and Friends. The video is fine, but not what we were expecting to get and did not hold the attention of my toddlers.",1323907200,,292,4.140350877192983
1890773,4,B00009V7QU,"This is a nice DVD for the Thomas fan, although it is fairly short. Stories include ""It's Only Snow,"" ""Jack Frost,"" ""Toby Had a Little Lamb,"" ""Snow,"" ""Thomas' Christmas Party,"" and ""Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree."" There are also three very short, very easy games--""Thomas' Order Fun,"" ""Match the Snowflake,"" and Decorate a Christmas Tree."" For those with young children who are huge Thomas fans, this will be a welcome addition to your DVD collection.",1179100800,,459,5.052631578947368
1890774,3,B00009V7QU,"The actual Thomas videos are standard fare, but the video extras are not very exciting.  There's one sing-a-long, which is ""Winter Wonderland.""  Our copy came with a cute frozen Percy and Christmas Caboose.

We have found that with the Carlin/Baldwin/Starr (this one is Carlin/Baldwin), our son is not as interested as with the British narrator.  Our son (two and a half) is used to watching Thomas on Saturday mornings on PBS.  This is our first video.  It has taken him a while to get used to the different narrators.  Actually, the first few times, he lost interest almost immediately.  As he has become used to the different narrator, he's gained interest, but if this is your first entry into the different narrators, just keep this in mind!

Overall, I'm just glad to finally have Thomas on demand!",1135728000,6,804,4.810218978102189
1890784,5,B00009V7QU,"A wonderful DVD for the holidays.  We bought this last Christmas, and have enjoyed it all year.  It comes with a darling wooden Holiday Caboose.",1127865600,,144,4.72
1890785,4,B00009V7QU,"We had purchased the Halloween release and my son watched it over and over again.  So when this winter/Christmas offering came along, we had to snap it up.  A great collection of five or six episodes, and a concluding music video.  Sure to please the young, the young at heart, and the train lover.  Also a great way to provide mom and dad some variety.",1105056000,7,353,4.384615384615385
1890786,5,B00009V7QU,"This movie was very good, they best one since volume one. Although 3 stories are ones we have already seen, there are 3 new holiday episodes plus a new music video.
Here are the new stories:
It's only Snow: Thomas must deliver the vilage people there Yule tree but when his snow plow plow brakes Thomas must get through the snow without it.
Jack Frost: Thomas tells Percy about Jack Frost but James discourages him in believing that there is a Jack Frost.
Toby had a little lamb: Toby must get the vet to the farm in time for his Sheep to have babies.
I'd recommend this one to all fans of Thomas the tank engine. It is 1 out of 2 volumes to recieve a solid 10(Thomas gets tricked was the other one) in my book.",1086566400,,711,4.197080291970803
1890787,5,B00009V7QU,I wish that this one was the first Christmas Tape and not the third. This video actually had all of the Christmas episodes on it. The first two needed other episodes in order to fill the tape. I wish all three of them had completly all new episodes on it. Toby had a little lamb was ok and Jack Frost was pretty pointless. The other one featured Thomas with a new snowplough unlike his regular blue one. The other three episodes were good but they were on the other two tapes. Thomas's Christmas Wonderland featured one new episode and it could've just been on this one. Thomas's Christmas Party had the other two but the other episodes on it were ok. I would recommend this one instead of the other two and it's not bad.,1077148800,,721,4.348148148148148
1890788,4,B00009V7QU,"my son can watch these movies over and over again, and he loves doing all the actvities and extras that are included on the dvds",1072569600,,128,4.16
1890789,3,B00009V7QU,"If you are expecting an ""all-new"" Thomas DVD, this is not it.  There are a few stories here that appeared on the earlier ""Thomas' Winter Wonderland,"" which was a stronger collection.  I have mentioned this on other Thomas DVD reviews, but once again it seems that Alec Baldwin is here and there when it comes to using consistent voices with these characters.  Not a bad set (I applaud any new Thomas release), but I found this somewhat disappointing.  Now when are they going to release ""The Best Of Toad The Brake Van""?

One last question: Are they ever going to put these episodes in order?  On many DVDs, stories that relate to one another are clearly out of order.  It would be nice if the video folks put a little more care into these things.

NOTE ADDED: Well, they ARE finally releasing Thomas adventures in order.  At present, THOMAS & FRIENDS: THE EARLY YEARS is now available (though it really should be called ""The Earliest Year"" or ""Year One"" since I have read that is what is covered in this three-disc set).  I hope there are more sets released.",1069113600,17,1059,4.555555555555555

He kept telling me he wanted to get this movie so as a reward we did. He enjoyed watching it and for the most part it held his attention. There were a few parts that were a little slow, but he has since asked to watch it again, multiple times, which tells me it is entertaining for him.",1459814400,2,446,3.966666666666667
