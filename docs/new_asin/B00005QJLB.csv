7950627,4,B00005QJLB,"This DVD is pretty well produced with a great soundtrack and great footage, and there's only one reason it's not getting 5 stars...because there's only so many times I can watch wheelies without getting bored...
Sure, there's lots of other tricks, but the majority of the footage is long wheelies on the highway.  More footage of the smaller tricks, or even more crashes instead would have been much better.
Overall, a great DVD - enough that I'm going to consider buying their 2 other ones they have out!",1075075200,,505,4.738636363636363
