5471643,5,B00AQNQZFA,"My ever-curious 8 year old boy loves this show.  He's never been super into cartoons, but, rather loves shows that are more reality type shows, especially where he learns stuff.  Chopped Junior, Flip or Flop, DIY Science and this show are his favorites.  He really loves that each Popular Mechanics show is about something different, interesting, yet fun to learn about.

Please be conscious of the frightening and upsetting nature of this episode. Why people think it's ok to terrorize children is beyond me!

I'm so glad that I have good program for my son",1463788800,,64,4.0
5471698,5,B00AQNQZFA,"This series is a great educational tool for kids. The hosts explore a ton of different scientific subjects in a fun way that holds my sons interest while also teaching him about a wide range of topics. Within each episode there is some basic information as well as some pretty detailed science. My son started watching at about age 4 and some of the information was too complex for him, but I watched along with him and answered his questions and he learned a ton! I think older kids would be able to understand a lot more of the videos on their own, but would still come away with some unanswered questions which is great way to start learning more independently. We definitely did some internet searches after watching episodes to keep learning more.

It is worth noting that season 1 of this show was made almost 20 years ago, so some of the information is a bit dated. This didn't decrease my son's interest at all, but did mean that some information is no longer accurate. For example in one of the episodes they talk briefly about electric cars--which at the time were not available to consumers. Obviously now electric cars are fairly common. At one point they mention the planned mission for NASA to send astronauts to Mars in 2014 (I actually don't recall what year they said, but it's in the past). So be aware that any scientific advancements/changes since the taping of the show will not be included.",1463184000,3,1412,4.603174603174603

5471741,5,B00AQNQZFA,"This is my 8 year old daughter's favorite show to watch. The content is educational and she loves that it is hosted by kids. The only issue is that it is dated since they stopped filming in 2001. The Big Dig in Boston was finished in 2002 and it was being built when they filmed there.  My daughter also got very excited about the Stratosphere roller coaster in Las Vegas which closed in 2005.  Regardless, I still think it is a 5 star show with concepts that still work today. I think that I notice the issues with the timeliness of the content more than she does. Highly recommended!",1455580800,,585,4.3577981651376145

5471979,4,B00AQNQZFA,"I watch this with my son and discuss what we are seeing together and while he learns about the many different topics, he's also entertained as the show has some fun/goofy bits and humor as they deliver the details about whatever the hosts are doing.

Some of the shows in this season are a bit less educational (race cars or toys) but those are still pretty fun to watch.

If your kid likes science or shows about how things work, this is a fine series to enjoy.

Also, given that watching all of the seasons on Prime is free...you can't go wrong!",1371772800,15,547,4.3431372549019605

I bought the original DVDs about 5 years ago and was very excited to see episodes that were only available on VHS are now available on DVD. Some of the shows are a little dated but the kids don't seem to mind.  They are scientific in a fun, easy to understand way. If your kids are interested in how things work, how things are made or science this is an excellent set to have. I keep them in my car for long trips and my kids have brought them to school for their teachers to show episodes to the class. Our favorites include ""Radical Rockets"" and the Aquarium episode.
