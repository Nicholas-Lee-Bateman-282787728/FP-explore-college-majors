912696,5,6304623631,"I have enjoyed this movie since the first time I saw it on TV, and have been desperate to own it on DVD for years now. Someone needs to put it out. It's a fun, clean movie, and David James Elliot is so handsome and charming in this role. It's a holiday heart warmer I know a lot of people would like to own on DVD. VCRs are becoming obsolete, and my taped copy won't last forever.

Someone please put this out on DVD!",1293321600,3,417,3.9642857142857144
912697,4,6304623631,"Remakes of classic movies are not often on par with the original, but my family finds this as enjoyable as the original version starring Janet Leigh and Robert Mitchum. In this take on the story Cynthia Gibb plays a young widowed Mom who can't let go of her past and seems to be trying to groom her son, Timmy, to become the ""man of the house"".

*Spoilers*

After playing a part in the firing of a store clerk she feels bad and offers to buy him lunch. They spend the rest of the day together with him following her around carrying all of the packages she is buying. They get separated on the subway and he tracks her down and shows up at her apartment that evening to deliver the packages, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend. A series of events (the mysterious arrival of an expensive toy train for Timmy on Christmas morning, the arrest of the store clerk on Christmas Day, and the returning of the cost of the train after Timmy takes it back to the store) keeps bringing them together. The attraction between them is obvious, but after the trial of losing her husband she now wants security and stability in her life and he is a much more free and easy type. So she becomes engaged to her boyfriend who is the steady, predictable type. Her son is not thrilled and in his frustration, makes things difficult.

Things really come to a head on Christmas Day when her in-laws from her first marriage come for the holiday celebration. An awkward moment in front of them with her two suitors forces her to make a quick decision, but later, as she celebrates New Year's Eve alone with her son, she considers what she has done and whether or not it will get her what she really wants. Maybe she has missed her chance.

Heartwarming, fun, clean, and filled with holiday cheer, this is worth adding to your holiday movie collection.",1287532800,3,1827,4.444776119402985

912701,5,6304623631,"Story of a young single mom and her son.  She's having a hard time getting over the death of her husband and has been dating a young attorney.  She meets another young man who sells her a toy train for use in her job but her son thinks it's for him for Christmas.
  The funniest scene occurs when the man who sold her the toy train is accused and arrested for something he did not do. The single mom is asked to come to the police station to clear up the story.  Her attorney boyfriend goes with her to help out.  The detective asking questions has great dry humor.
  It all works out in the end.  A fun story.",1213142400,11,610,4.0588235294117645

Last year I saw this version with one of my favorite actors - David James Elliott - Harmon Raab  from JAG.  This version is a very good update to the original.  The  storyline and characters were very believable.  I couldn't believe the  price increase for the train though!  If you need a holiday fix or want to  spend a few hours enjoying a nice old-fashioned movie, watch this one  during the holidays.  Enjoy!  Happy Holidays!",946512000,37,553,4.587628865979381

912798,4,6304623631,"Watched it tonight. Cynthia Gibb has starred in a number of Christmas movies over the years and we've liked her in all of them. This remake of the Robert Mitchum/Janet Leigh holiday mixer is pretty much true to the original story line, with a few minor changes that don't get in the way. Sometime in the next week we'll probably watch them back-to-back.
