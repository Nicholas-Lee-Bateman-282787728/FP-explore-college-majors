4989597,5,B006HGXGWA,"Embarrassed to admit it, but Dumb & Dumber is one of my husband's favorite comedies.  The bathroom scene cracks him up every time.  My mom refuses to watch it.  Lol!

4989605,3,B006HGXGWA,"The disc came as described.
I checked them both out to see how the quality is...
they are both ehh...The Mask which I really wanted on blu-ray looks ok. the lighting in most parts are fixed and look nice...but the quality doesn't really look 1080p...it looks like 720 or a bit higher...nothing special...no menu except for special features...I own the dvd but its a old version so I wanted to upgrade...I am happy with the sound. its really clear and really good. But I have seen better releases of 80s to 90s films with better quality.

Dumb and Dumber...I got this only because 1 its unrated 2 I no longer own the dvd...and 3...its blu ray...this film was somethign I grew up with. over all it also looks just ok. some noise reduction is spotted...the sound is great...i haven't watched the film fully...but over all both look just ok. its a nice set to own...but its not the best...",1450483200,,885,4.566037735849057
4989606,5,B006HGXGWA,Excellent aaaaaaaaaa,1442275200,,20,9.5
4989607,4,B006HGXGWA,"A great, affordable little collection of two Jim Carrey movies from his hay-day, this double feature was a steal really.

The Mask is probably my all-time favorite Jim Carrey movie and if I'm not mistaken, also my first.  Jim Carrey does a wonderful job acting in both of these films.

Dumb & Dumber isn't really my kind of movie, even for comedy, but it is decent, and the Blu-Ray adaptation of both of these movies was a welcome addition.  The Blu-Ray adaptations however, don't have much different from the original DVD versions.  The graphical quality is a little better, but not by much, but the sound is greatly improved.

Just a nice affordable collection of two good Jim Carrey movies, not really much that can go wrong here.",1442275200,,733,4.6875

4989631,4,B006HGXGWA,"Dumb and Dumber came up in a recent lunch conversation and I just had to have it to watch again. This two-pack was a great value. While it isn't the best HD presentation, does that really matter in comedies?",1402704000,,207,4.333333333333333

4989638,5,B006HGXGWA,Dumb and Dumber is Jim Carrey at his best. It is worth buying this combo pack just for that movie. Both movies are great to watch over and over again.,1378339200,,150,4.033333333333333

4989645,4,B006HGXGWA,"I would definitely recommend this 2 in 1 bluray double feature if you do not have dumb and dumber or the mask.
Both of these movies are hilarious and have a nostalgic feel to them if you were born in the early nineties.",1377302400,2,219,4.116279069767442

4989648,4,B006HGXGWA,"The Mask is just a movie classic at this point. It really launched Carrey at the time, which later allowed him to command mega bucks on future films, but from beginning to end the comedy is timeless, the effects were cartoonish enough where you didn't judge them compared to today's abilities. Cameron is perfect. The extras were really good as well.

Dumb and Dumber just falls flat for me. I actually turned it off after skimming through a bit.",1366070400,3,446,4.6455696202531644
4989649,5,B006HGXGWA,I Rated it a 5 because I believe these Old Classic Movies are a Must have for Jim Carrey Fans. It's Dumb & Dumber & The MASK all in one how can you beat that to make it better on Blu-ray now out of all things this (Double Feature Rocks). The only down fall I disliked is I purchased it for $11.00 & something and before I got this Blu-ray in the mail I'm not sure if it was even shipped yet the Price to $9.99 dropped & I still paid the 11 something which sucks but with the other products I did buy went up in Price so I suppose it evened it out either way can't get the ones that only drop and not expect it to change if it goes up so i guess theres a + somewhere lol. I would recommend this product to anyone who LOVES JIM CARREY MOVIES! These will make you laugh.,1363305600,7,767,3.830188679245283
4989650,5,B006HGXGWA,"good movies, disks are nice because there bluray and 1080p picture and play on my ps3 also. good movie combo",1359072000,,108,4.45
4989651,4,B006HGXGWA,"I admit, I love Jim Carrey.  Are these two of his best movies?  NO!  But getting the two together for under $12 (at the time I purchased it) was worth the money!  The transfer looks good and I got to really enjoy seeing Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz together again in The Mask!!",1357430400,2,276,4.150943396226415
4989652,4,B006HGXGWA,"This version of Dumb & Dumber is like a Director's cute, it includes things that were cut out of the original film and the scenes don't really add to the comedy. I really wish this was the original release of Dumb & Dumber.",1356480000,12,223,4.209302325581396
4989653,4,B006HGXGWA,"I've been wanting to get these two on Blu-ray and this bundle gave me the opportunity to save some cash at the same time. If you haven't seen either one of these, they are both Jim Carey at his best.",1347494400,,199,4.0
