8721433,4,B0106STCIG,"Mondo Macabro recently got it's hands on a trio of Greek b-films and it's a good thing cause I've learned Greek film is just as wild as Turkish film. The Wife Killer is straight up direct marketing. Everything you need to know is in the title. The original title was The Rape Killer and honestly that's just a little to on target. You gotta save a surprise or two.

Needless to say the movie is sleazy. It concerns an older woman who has married a much younger sea captain who wants to have her murdered by a sex maniac to get her money. It sounds dire but the scariness is sucked right out of it when the title of the film comes flying out of the mom jeans clad butt of the sex maniac at the beginning of the film. Before the title card from the butt move, he's appropriately creepy and doing his best Zodiac Killer impersonation making the butt title card even funnier. In fact, everyone in this film does a great job at almost everything except looking young. It's mostly cranky looking middle aged people in a sleazier Hitchcock situation that's even more off the rails simply cause they never let you spend time with any sort of hero character.

The DVD here is good as is to be expected by any Mondo Macabro release. You get a dub track and Greek with subtitles audio track too. The picture quality is great. They put up a disclaimer at the beginning but frankly the momentary lapses in film quality aren't going to be caught by the vast majority of people.

Worth picking up if you like sleazy crime movies.",1473638400,4,1514,4.380782918149467
8721434,5,B0106STCIG,"New from Mondo Macabro is volume 2 in their brand new Greek collection. As I stated in my review for Tango of Perversion, I knew absolutely nothing about Greek films before these two great titles came along. But if these are any hint of the types of Greek films that are out there, then I hope Mondo Macabro releases more!

The Wife Killer (aka Death Kiss and the rather harsh titled The Rape Killer) tells the story of a gold digger who plans to have his rich sugar mama off'd to inherit her fortune. See he's got a girl on the side that he plans on taking off in his new yacht to live happily ever after with. Who is he going to have commit the crime for him? Well this creep just happens to be friends with a fine chap who gets his jollies by raping and killing women. As would be expected, double crossings, murders and other sleazy activities ensue.

The Wife Killer (as was stated on the DVD cover) definitely felt similar to the Italian gialli from the 70's. And though there was no mystery killer walking around dressed head to toe in black, there were copious amounts of plot twists, sex and bloody violence. Where some of the gialli were more ""style over substance"" (not that there was anything wrong with that), The Wife Killer, like Tango of Perversion, is very well written and completely sensical. There are beautiful women to ogle at, lots of red stuff and you'll find yourself scratching your head wondering what's going to happen until the last frame. Like Mondo Macabro's Tango of Perversion DVD, The Wife Killer is presented with a very nice looking, uncut transfer as well as an interview with the producer, trailers and a documentary on Greek cinema.",1449532800,12,1671,4.548172757475083
