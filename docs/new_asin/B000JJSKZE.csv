2672740,3,B000JJSKZE,"There were three Majin movies all together, but these are the two that were released for US television viewing. As a kid, I thought these movies was boring because the ""monster"" doesn't come out until the end.  Well, the robot didn't come out until the end of Johnny Sokko, but that was a half hour tv show so I only had to wait 20 minutes each day.  It was all about the action. Which is also why I thought the original Godzilla was boring as a kid, and now I think it's a quality drama with a serious message.

As an adult, it's not all about the monster scenes. The plots are pretty formula, but good.  Evil lord terrorizes his people or invades a neighboring kingdom and the victims pray for their ""God"" to save them, which it does at the last minute. I felt for the victims and I couldn't wait for the giant to answer their prayers. This DVD is the dubbed version and I wish the movies were in Japanese and sub-titled. I would have gotten a lot more out of it emotionally and appreciated the acting more if I heard the voices of the original actors.

What was kind of frustrating and fun for me was trying to figure out the time period the movies takes place.  They are unrelated so they might take place during different time periods. Based on what appears to be an Ainu community that is still somewhat independent from Japanese rule, I thought it might be Heian period, but then they brought out muskets, so it could have been Sengoku (Warring States)and the second movie is most likely Sengoku since one kingdom is invading two others, and muskets are used.

What's the DVD like.  Well, it's just like watching the movies on an old rabbit-eared tv, complete with a break between reels and the dubbed dialogue.  It's as if someone took a video off a broadcast and copied it onto a dvd.

For nostalgia sake, this version does the job, but if you want a more serious experience, it's probably better to get the original Japanese language version by ADV films.",1255132800,4,1965,4.433333333333334
2672741,3,B000JJSKZE,"Growing up in the 1970s, I used to watch these films on Creature Double Feature on Channel 56 in Boston.  I recall not liking them so much because the monster didn't stomp until almost the end of the film.  However, when I recently watched the first movie (Giant Majin), I actually thought the plot was good!  I thought I was going to end up fast fowarding to the end, but I was into the movie.  A very pleasant surprise and a nice trip down memory lane.  I gave this 3 instead of 4 stars because I thought the second movie lacked in plot, but the special effects were good.",1249516800,,574,4.229357798165138
2672742,5,B000JJSKZE,"I was so shocked to find this after so many years of looking. I truly enjoyed watching the two films, especially the first movie which I had not seen in over 30 years. Although tame by today's standards, the plots and effects are fun and I hope to find the third movie soon. Even my wife enjoyed seeing them.",1244419200,2,308,4.237288135593221
2672743,5,B000JJSKZE,"I just orered this DvD and cannot wait t get it. If Its as good as Retromedias Gamera film discs than I will have no complaints at all. All I ask of any video release of Japanese monster films is that they be as good as the ones I

saw on WDCA channel 20 in Washington DC  from 1975-1985, when they ran the series Creature Feature, Sci FI Theatre and Saturday Creature Features. Yes its great to have the widescreen version with the japanese language

track. But I will never appreciate it as much as the  versions I grew up with.

As for the Majin movies themselves: These are the first two films. Majin The Monster of Terror (aka D)Dimajin or Giant Majin 1966) and Return of the Giant Majin (DaiMajin ikaru or Giant Majin Becomes Enraged aka Wrath of Daimajin 1966)

These versions were dubbed and sold directly to TV by American International in 1968.

The first film had played in selected US theatres in '66 under the simple title Majin in a dubbed and subtitled version. It is uncertain why AIP never picked up the third film fr US TV.(it is entirely possible that Daiei never offered thefilm.) And since 16mm film was the standard format for UHF stations, thats how these are presented.

The third movie is called DaiMajin's Counterattack or Return of Daimajin (This second title has caused confusion in recent years sinc it is similar to AIPs title for the second film) It remained unreleased in the US

until its VHS release in the late 1990s.

If you want the third film, or widescreen, or japanese language you will want the version from ADVFILMS.

If you want to see the ones you grew up with, buy this version from Retromedia and thank Fred Olan Ray.

If the film does contain leader as the other reviews claim, Im sure it is because Fred is just trying to preserve

a feel of nostalgia. I don't mind that at all. I have come to the conclusion that people who like to make fun of these films always will, no matter how they look.

I once had a customer( I work in a video store) tell me she thought the Tri star Godzilla was fantastic and all the old ones were just a guy is a rubber suit with a visible zipper. She knew I was a fan of the ""old"" one

and basically was just saying that to be mean. I could have called her something terrible starting with ""B"" or

""C"" or even ""N"" (it was only a temp job, who cared about getting fired). But I didnt, because I knew that basically Im cool and she isn't. She losses out, I dont. She only gets to enjoy one monster movie. I get to enjoy hundreds. She hurt my feelings , if only a little, but  I decided to be the bigger man and not be mean to someone over a simple matter of taste.  You cannot make the whole world happy.

But today, I am happy with both Majin video sets. Buy Retromedia's an ADV and you will literaly have every version available (I don't think there IS an english dubbed International version of  Return of DaiMajin, Hopefully Im wrong). Doing this with Godzilla or even Gamera is a much harder task.

Just one note to the parents. Remember thar Majin is much more violent than his brother Gamera or Godzilla.

Majin is also a pretty scary looking character and all three films are pretty much aimed at adults, so younger kids might be a bit disturbed by him. Hes a far cry from Minya.

PS. THANKS FRED!!!",1170720000,5,3283,4.328431372549019
2672744,2,B000JJSKZE,"Being a huge Kaiju Eiga fan, and (unlike the previous reviewer) crazy about the Daimajin films, I had to have this, even though I do own the ADV set AND the Japanese Laserdisc set. It's rather nostalgic to see these in the English-dubbed versions I first saw in the 1960s. Obviously, these films suffer greatly from the Pan-and-Scan treatment, and the dubbed dialogue is a bit silly at times. Print quality is watchable if far from ideal, and there is one ridiculous moment in MAJIN in which there is a reel change, and the leader is actually left in there...for a split-second, an upside-down photo of a woman can actually be seen! Come on, guys- how difficult would it have been to edit that out? Is Retromedia trying to recreate the ""UHF Experience"" with such goofs? We may never know...if you must see the dubbed versions of these films, get this, but be advised of its inherent inferiority to the real deal. By the way: it's a dirty shame that the proposed DAIMAJIN remake was cancelled, as I know that Takashi Miike would have done a great job. Someday...",1168819200,12,1061,4.619047619047619
2672745,1,B000JJSKZE,"Retromedia strikes again with another quickie release. These movies are already available from ADV as a THREE MOVIE box set..(count them)..THE COMPLETE MAJIN COLLECTION and remastered unlike this dvd release. These versions are not letterboxed nor subtitled. If you want to enjoy the AIP dubbed releases that we all watched as kids then buy this disc....BUT if you are a serious collector looking for definative versions..AVOID this dvd at all cost.

This reviewer honestly wonders why Retromedia takes such pride in releasing these movies that aren't much better quality than the VHS tapes we seek to replace. Retromedia's asking price should be under 10 bucks for this stuff. Being a Kaiju fan, the Majin movies do not rank highly with my personal tastes but they deserve more than what this company has done with them.",1168560000,12,821,5.0814814814814815

8151083,5,B000JJSKZE,This collection advertises the complete collection but only has two of the three movies on one DVD.One movie per side. This really doesen't matter as if you have seen one giant majin movie you have pretty much seen them all. Besides the price was right. The three movie DVD price was way too high. The movies though are top notch. Both the story line and special effects are great. They are also in color wich brings out the bad ass look on the Majins face. These films are from the same studio that made the Gamera movies but a much higher quality product. I really enjoyed these films. Some of the best Kaiju movies out there.,1365638400,,628,4.422413793103448

8151085,5,B000JJSKZE,"Hey Badwolf - you're missing the point here. I don't think anyone would disagree that the best way to view these movies is in their original Japanese release format - which you can do with the old ADV set, or better yet with the new Mill Creek Entertainment Blu ray set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daimajin-Triple-Feature-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B008L0YMSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daimajin - Triple Feature Collector's Edition - Blu-ray</a>) which gives you all three movies with vastly superior prints and in their original aspect ratio (the ADV DVD set offered only two of the three in their original ratio).

Having said that what this Retromedia release offers us is the original A.I.P. television releases (for US TV) of the first two movies. They were English dubbed and cropped for television but it was the way many of us first saw them in the 60s and 70s. It would have been nice to have these as an added feature on the Blu Ray set but hey, since that's not the case it's cool of Retromedia to make them available this way.

One school of thought is that American dubbed versions of Japanese movies are terrible and therefore worthless - the second school finds good lighthearted fun and nostalgia in viewing the versions we first watched as kids. I am firmly in the second school, but also love watching the original versions as well. So now we have a great Blu Ray set of the originals and a nice set of the two edited american TV versions - the best of both worlds as far as I'm concerned. [For a great rant in support of enjoying both dubbed and original versions listen to David Kalat's excellent commentary on Ghidorah The Three Headed Monster&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghidorah-The-Three-Headed-Monster/dp/B000OCY7IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghidorah: The Three-Headed Monster</a>]

I have a feeling most Daimajin fans that are aware of what this set is would want it for completist reasons and/or just for the fun of it. I say it's well worth the price - if it weren't for A.I.P. we may never have known of Japanese Kaiju movies in the first place, and I love them for it! God Bless A.I.P. and thanks Retromedia!!! (and no, I don't work for either of them you loony conspiracy theorists!) Cheers!
