8105126,1,B000E3L7GE,I won a chance to be in this movie many years ago. Now that I've finally seen the final product I know why they never called me to make a sequel.,1367107200,,145,3.7096774193548385
8105127,4,B000E3L7GE,"A strange documentary kind of film that could only have been made in the 1970's. A number of people are invited do tell the filmmakers what their ultimate sexual desire would be, after which they are given a chance to actually have these played out for real, with the help of porn Robert Kerman (who is know by serious filmfanatics for his part in Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust), amongst others. It turns out that these (real) people have (really) weird fantasies ranging from being abaused by medics while being operated upon  to something as predictable as a guy wishing do experience a threesome. What is so stunning about this documentary is that we learn that even in the wild years of free love people simply couldn't handle this freedom because the desires they have turn out do be as disappointing as they are weird. It turns out that only the guy with the least redicilous wishes (the threesome with two girls) actually enjoyed the experience. It seems that then and now people always want do make more of sex that there actually is. For this alone it is an interesting film to watch. We get to see the entire process, from people being selected in the street, them telling about their desires and the action out, all rounded out by their commentaries on the experiences. All of this with very straight faces and surprisingly little gratuitous nudity, giving the viewer the impression that a scientific research to all this was the goal, and not to get as much as cheap nude scenes as possible, which of course is nonsense but makes for extremely fun viewing. A time capsule like this would probably have been lost forever if it wasn't for a company named Troma. Recommended.",1198281600,2,1683,4.724489795918367
8105128,5,B000E3L7GE,"This is an unusual gem from the late 70s.

One of the great things about DVD is that all sorts of strange, rare movies are coming out of the woodwork, and this is one of them: a documentary about people sharing their sexual fantasies, and a number of them getting the chance to act them out with a troupe of willing actors.

The end result is funnier and more clinically fascinating than it is erotic, but I can honestly say I've never seen a movie like this.  The movie is rated X, but there is no explictness, like in something like 9 SONGS.  As an interesting sidenote, this documentary was codirected by Ralph Rosenblum, who worked as an editor for Woody Allen and Mel Brooks.

Also, the DVD features a 15-minute interview in a hotel room between Lloyd Kaufman, the president of Troma, and Mr. Skin, who runs a popular website about nudity in movies.",1144627200,,854,4.483870967741935
