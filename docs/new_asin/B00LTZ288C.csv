A great story of personal demons and triumphs and the prevailing theme to never give up on yourself, your dreams and the needs and hopes of others around you. I don't know how historically accurate the story is as it is based on real persons in a true story. If anything it is great entertainment and has a great message.

Amazon is exceptional,

Wonderful story about how a preacher should be...living in his community, involved with all his community and a special love and tender care for his parishoners.  Gave me inspiration on how I should be in today's world.  I loved the way the music was put together  one writing the lyrics and they other the music notes and of course God creating the events leadsing up to its creation and then the preformance.
It will be a favorite for many years. Also bought copies to share.  You haven't been to church for awhile - watch this then pray God will lead you
to a church with a preacher totaly commited to the truth of the Bible.",1479859200,6,668,4.442622950819672
