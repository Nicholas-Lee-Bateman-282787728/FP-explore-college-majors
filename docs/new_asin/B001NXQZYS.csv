8328127,5,B001NXQZYS,One of the best videos to help understand and show how to create a strong connection with your lover using the tantric style.,1413072000,,125,4.478260869565218
8328128,4,B001NXQZYS,"Comparing this to the dance movies I watch is the best way of describing this series.  Both teach and remind me of the things I forget whether on the dance floor or on the sheets.  In that sense it is good.  The movies also help break some of my inhibitions, which is always good.  Now, if they can kill most of the feel good commentary, it would be even better.",1393804800,,362,4.128571428571429
8328129,3,B001NXQZYS,"This product was not what I thought it would be, but I kept it because it had very interesting ideas and visuals to assist in intimacy.",1319155200,2,135,4.230769230769231
8328130,2,B001NXQZYS,Too much talk and not enough action. You'll get more for your money elsewhere. Try renting at the adult section in your local video store or shop Adam and Eve or another site. This DVD is a waste of your money,1293580800,2,209,4.121951219512195
8328131,2,B001NXQZYS,"Was disappointed in set. Would not purchase again. The other video I purchased ""The Tantric Secrets of Sacred Sex"" was excellent. It explained the spiritual aspects & emotions of males & females & the basic premise of Tantric Lovemaking. This set was a little Tantric Sex (not lovemaking) & was more like something you would pick up at an adult porn shop. For anyone serious about learning Tantric sex, there are better videos out there.",1291507200,5,437,4.84
8328132,2,B001NXQZYS,"I was under the impression that I will learn about tantric sex techniques. But honestly,I was rather disappointed. It was more like a guideline how to practice porn sex. I have some knowledge about Tantra. It is about tapping into the unlimited sexual energy that resides in us and using this energy to get in touch with our own spirit as well as to connect to our sex partner at the spiritual level. In this way, we get in touch with the Divine inside us and realize it in our sex partner as well. Tantra is ultimately about spiritual awareness.  Well, this DVD set is not even close in achieving this goal.",1276646400,33,608,4.428571428571429
8328133,5,B001NXQZYS,"This set is explicit and very informative. These dvd's take a couple to a much more sophisticated level of intimacy in a loving relationship. They are good fun, very informative and very sexy ~ it will take weeks to 'work' your way through them with your partner!",1270166400,15,263,4.617021276595745
