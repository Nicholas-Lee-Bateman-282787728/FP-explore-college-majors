2632962,5,B000HC2LMG,"VCI Video and Kit Parker Films have released LITTLE BIG HORN (1951) and RIMFIRE (1949) under the Western Film Noir banner.
These two almost forgotten Lippert westerns deserve the new life they have been granted on DVD in an impressive double feature format; and, above all, they should carry their noir stamp proudly.
LITTLE BIG HORN and RIMFIRE as well achieve their undeniably striking visual effectiveness through Ernest Miller's masterful camera work. Cinematographer Miller (who, by the way, was behind the camera for most of the moody Lippert westerns) imparts to both films a foreboding, fatalistic ambiance, which he renders in low-keyed black-and-white cinematography. And in addition, by frequently utilizing stark camera angles, Miller creates an undercurrent of uneasiness, which is a major noir ingredient in these somber westerns.

LITTLE BIG HORN tells the story of a small U.S. Cavalry unit that challenges destiny when it is ordered to deliver an urgent message to Custer warning him of impending mortal danger at Little Big Horn. The suspense mounts as members of the patrol commence to be eliminated by hostile Indians in a and-then-there-were-none manner.
John Ireland, Lloyd Bridges, and Marie Windsor in standout performances elevate the human drama to a nearly Shakespearean level, as patrol commander Bridges is confronted by his inner demons of jealousy and suspicion involving his wife Windsor and lower-ranked officer Ireland.
The supporting cast also shines; with Reed Hadley, Hugh O'Brian, King Donovan, and Wally Cassell tensely reacting to the dangers surrounding them.
Charles Marquis Warren guides LITTLE BIG HORN with strong, sure-handed direction. Warren exhibits a special liking for visual narrative rather than extended verbal communication. Consequently, close-ups of facial features expressing apprehensiveness, and concentration on natural objects that are present in the often shadowy western landscape abound while nature itself remains a calmly objective and impartial observer of human behavior. What a magnificent film noir this is- without an asphalt jungle but with a rocky western terrain!
Here it might be of interest to note that Charles Marquis Warren also made HELLGATE (1952), perhaps the darkest film this side of Murnau's NOSFERATU to appear in the lineup of Lippert westerns. HELLGATE (again phtographed by Ernest Miller) is not yet available on DVD; but let's hope it will show up soon, and give us a noir fix lasting at least a month.

RIMFIRE relates the story of an undercover agent in post-Civil War Texas who has problems staying alive while snooping around, looking for a stolen gold shipment in a town run by corrupt gamblers.
Well directed by B. Reeves Eason, this very obscure film benefits immensely from Ernest Miller's eerily atmospheric cinematography. But it is also the unusual script written by Frank Wisbar (together with Arthur St. Claire and producer Ron Ormond) that gives RIMFIRE much added strength and substance.
Wisbar had earlier directed STRANGLER OF THE SWAMP (1945), for which he wrote the screenplay based on his own original story. This intentionally out-of-focus, mist-drenched, and otherworldly B-horror film with a pronounced German Expressionist flavor, did actually enjoy a minor cult following and is still quite interesting today (available from Amazon). The reappearance of a man wrongly executed was the center of attention in Wisbar's STRANGLER. Interestingly, a variation on that theme found its way into RIMFIRE, helping to make it such a beautifully realized little western noir with a nice ghostly touch.
Also, James Millican; Mary Beth Hughes; Reed Hadley; and Henry Hull lend good acting talent to this film.

After almost 6 decades, both LITTLE BIG HORN and RIMFIRE hold up amazingly well today. VCI Video and Kit Parker Films deserve a standing ovation for letting us now own and enjoy these darkly stylized and engrossingly suspenseful horse opera noirs.

5 stars, unhesitatingly (10 even, had Amazon granted additional star space for this great double feature)!",1158278400,34,4069,5.413249211356467
2632994,1,B000HC2LMG,These real old B&W B movies are not any good. I receive it in good shape and on time as promised but I still didn't like it.,1316563200,,124,3.6296296296296298
2632995,4,B000HC2LMG,"LITTLE BIG HORN was the nice find here among these two obscure B Westerns. About a calvary patrol racing to Little Big Horn to warn Custer and the 7th cavalry that they'll be walking into an unbeatable number of Sioux. Soapy subplot of patrol leader, played by Lloyd Bridges [in the iconic HIGH NOON the following year], about to lose unfaithful spouse, played by always-turbulent noir femme fatale Marie Windsor [terrific in Kubrick's THE KILLING, 1956] to a fellow officer played by vet John Ireland [RED RIVER, 1948; SPARTACUS, 1960]. The film gets off to an inauspicious start as Bridges looks in need of a cathartic after walking in on his wife and colleague. It seems Army life is not to her liking and Ireland is awaiting approval of his resignation from the Army so that they could return back East together. Commanding officer Bridges, though, has the advantage as he orders his rival to become part of his tired and depleted patrol in their arduous trek 250 miles through Sioux country to warn Custer on time. Ireland, however, believes the journey is foolish and likely to get most, if not all, of Bridge's men killed, including Ireland himself---pretty convenient. Bridges insists he needs a second-in-command to complete the mission should he go down at enemy hands.

This now becomes an interesting film though its low-budget B-origins are evident throughout in cursory, choppy shots and editing, much studio filming [often felt like I was watching a Western TV series than a movie] and some occasionally stoic Indians. Very engaging array of respected veteran actors comprising part of the patrol including Jim Davis [Jock Ewing in the long-running and classic DALLAS TV Series], Reed Hadley [RACKET SQUAD TV Series], Hugh O'brian [THE SHOOTIST, 1976], King Donovan [INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, 1956] and country singer/actor Sheb Wooley [HIGH NOON, 1952]. Davis is a petulant, trail-beaten vet who sides with Bridges. Hadley, with that been-through-this-before face, plays the grizzled no-family/nowhere-to-go lifer who's the third in command. O'brian and Wooley play courageous scouts---O'brian younger and self-assured and Wooley older and wiser. Donovan is the ugly-duckling soldier who's been waiting for his lonely-hearts 'mail-order' bride to arrive at the local Fort. Nice interaction between the vets and the first-timers, including an 18-year old sick to his stomach at the prospect of the dangers ahead.

Dissension ensues as soldiers are killed and Bridges' motives are questioned. He follows the Army's credo to sacrifice a few to save many. Thus, the translocation is based on the use of the pointman [the lead rider who goes ahead and gives the OK for the rest to follow], a role best avoided as every 'point' has been killed or injured. Nice scenario as the boys draw cards to see who gets to be the next pointman. A neophyte draws the decisive card but seasoned scout O'brian decides to take his place. Unfortunately, O'brian, like the other scout [Wooley], is injured and killed. The group subsequently encounters a wagon train that has been attacked and plundered---heartrending scene as Donovan's lonely-hearts bride-to-be is found sitting in her wagon, expired. The patrol is quickly ambushed and Bridges mortally wounded. Ireland now has to decide whether to take the depleted unit and consummate Bridges' mission---now most certainly a suicidal endeavor---or return home. See what they decide yourself. Brooding study of American military commitment, conviction, courage, comraderie and duty, and the fears, doubts and prejudices they must also battle. Rating: 4.2/5

RIMFIRE is a contrived, clumsy little B-Western and a lesser effort than the overachieving LITTLE BIG HORN. About a cowpoke falsely accused of cheating in a poker game. He is put on trial and sentenced to hang by the worst Judge ever. After the hanging his accusers get murdered one after the other, presumably by the victim's vindictive ghost. Novel plot and who-dun-it guesswork a plus but some buffoonery by a couple of cowboy comics unnecessary and annoying. Most interesting is a few veteran pro's they procured for this obscure film. Fun seeing Glenn Strange, who played Frankenstein [HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, 1944; HOUSE OF DRACULA, 1945; ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN, 1948] and who was the bartender in the classic TV series GUNSMOKE, 1955-1975 [always thought he was a trifle creepier than Karloff as the monster], playing a stagecoach driver. James Millican [who can forget his irritatingly cogent performance as the Sheriff who wants James Stewart to leave town in, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, 1955, and his gutless exit as Gary Cooper's deputy in HIGH NOON] plays the good guy here but appears uncomfortable in a rare lead role. Also a pleasure seeing the great Henry Hull [Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT, 1944] stirring things up a bit, as usual. Reed Hadley returns here too. Rating: 3/5.",1306368000,,4903,5.195954487989886

2632997,4,B000HC2LMG,"LITTLE BIG HORN (1951, directed by Charles Marquis Warren)

As you might guess, this is about the Battle at the Little Big Horn, Custer's Last Stand in 1876...well, almost. It's actually about a small patrol that rides to try to warn Custer of the danger, and their desperate 3 day, 250 mile ride to a rescue which as we know never happened. Lloyd Bridges is Captain Philip Donlin; in the beginning of the film, Donlin's wife Celie (Marie Windsor, looking more like Joan Crawford than ever) has had it with him always being away, and is about to take off with Lieutenant John Haywood (John Ireland) who is leaving the army. But fate intervenes and Donlin catches them...though he does nothing. Weeks later, his patrol and Haywood's meet up, and he commands the junior officer to ride with him to Custer's rescue. Thus the tension between the two men, which plays out over the course of the film, is set in motion.

The funny thing is that though this rivalry is pretty well played, and never really overdone, it isn't really necessary; it acts mostly as a plot device to show the contrasting approaches to leadership between Donlin - willing to sacrifice his whole squad if it will give Custer's 300 any chance - and Haywood, who feels it's a fool's errand. The affair seems a little forced and not really needed; but it also doesn't really get in the way of the real juice of the story, which is the interrelationships between the two officers and their 15 men, most of whom are developed quite well over the course of the tight 85 minutes. Grierson (Reed Hadley) is probably the most interesting, a bitter career officer demoted and serving under younger men, but unwilling to ever completely give up. There's an Indian scout, Arika, played by Native American actor Rodd Redwing, suspected by many of the soldiers but proving his worth before it's all over. Every character is quickly and broadly, yet fairly realistically drawn, and though there are the expected plot developments - attempted mutinies and desertions, the slow whittling of the force - it all plays out naturally at a steadily increasing tension.

This is labelled as ""western noir"", but though it is more ""noirish"" than usual in a western I suppose - the lighting in particular is very high-contrast and there are a lot of night scenes, and an aura of fatalism hangs over the whole endeavor - on the whole this is closer to a grim war film than anything else, played out in a western setting. The Sioux could easily be the Germans; their savagery isn't really played up, race doesn't come into it all that much - they are merely the enemy to be won through. In fact the film at times bears a passing resemblance to some of Sam Fuller's tough, cheap, hard war films, and I can't say I was too surprised to find that the expert photography here was accomplished by Ernest Miller, the cinematographer on Fuller's THE STEEL HELMET from the same year.

A few weak fight sequences - clearly the budget didn't allow for a lot of time spent on perfect choreography - and a bit too much repetition of the whole ""few for the many"" speech in its various guises - but on the whole this is really solid stuff and among the better westerns of this type I've seen lately.

RIMFIRE (1949, directed by B. Reeves Eason)

Like the previous film, this is a nice transfer that looks and sounds great; it's ""noir"" interest is fairly minimal; but it's somewhat interesting to b-western aficionados, particularly those into the more oddball stuff. Alas this one isn't really that good when it comes down to it.

A stagecoach is held up a few miles outside of Stringtown. Among the passengers is the Abilene Kid (Reed Hadley), who loses his watch and a wallet to the bandits before the coach is rescued by stranger Tom Harvey (James Millican). Accompanying the coach into town, Harvey makes the acquaintance of Polly (Mary Beth Hughes), the niece of Sheriff Jordan (Victor Kilian), who offers Harvey a job and soon finds out that the young man is no ordinary stranger, and is on a special mission.

Meanwhile the Kid finds town rich guy/saloon owner Barney Bernard (Ray Bennett) who he knows is actually behind the holdup. Threatening to expose Bernard, the Kid gets his money back and decides to play some poker and increase his bankroll. But Bernard has other ideas, and soon the Kid is fighting for his life in a courtroom, accused of using marked cards to cheat at the game. Nearly the whole town is against him, with a newspaperman making cynical pronouncements as he's sentenced to death. But the Kid won't go quiteley to his grave...or will he?

The second half of the film becomes something of a murder mystery as one by one those who voted to hang the Kid or were complicit in his arrest are killed and playing cards left with them. But deputy Harvey doesn't believe in the supernatural, ghostly explanation that is scaring the townspeople and pushing some to leave, and sets out to find the real perp - which he does in a terribly anticlimactic and stupid final reel that takes this fairly solid programmer into laughable territory. During the whole trial and hanging sequence, it seemed like the film was going into an interesting territory in examing the railroading of a man, the guilty-until-innocent nature of frontier justice, perhaps something on the nature of the gambler in the west. But no, we get an out-of-nowhere climax and a stupid conclusion marked by a couple of dumb humorous bits from a pair of comics (Fuzzy Knight and Chris-Pin Martin) who appear a couple of other times in the film for no good reason other than to bring down the seriousness.

Hadley is good, doing something of a John Carradine role, and Millican has a bit of charisma; the rest of the actors are mostly broad character types, a bit too broad for the fast-paced action story that most of the film is supposed to be.  I've got no problems with the direction, by old pro ""Breezy"" Eason, mostly remembered for his work on Republic serials.  It's the script, in the second half, that's the real problem.  All in all it's cheap, forgettable and fairly dumb, but it's also only an hour of your time to waste.

This VCI release includes their typical extras of trailers for the two films and a few other westerns they've released, and short bios.  As I said above, the transfers are good, and I think most western buffs will feel this is worth it for LITTLE BIG HORN; some might like the corny RIMFIRE more than I did, too.",1264291200,,6460,4.64943032427695
2632998,3,B000HC2LMG,A movie which captures the essence of what went on behing the scenes leading up too the devasting defeat of Custer at The Battle of The Little Bighorn.  The movie contains several young actors who went on too have great careers in television & movies.  It is a very suspensfull movie for its time,1190332800,3,296,4.462962962962963
2632999,2,B000HC2LMG,"It is difficult to understand if we really have seen the same films. Rimfire is a typical B-westerns which I could stand, but Little Big Horn has all the cavalry clichs like fighting officers etc. I am rooting for indians at present so I was happy that the message did not get through - which would have been against the reality. If this gets five stars, John Ford trilogy must get at least 20 each.",1189900800,,399,4.333333333333333
2633000,3,B000HC2LMG,"Never having seen either of these movies, but being a fan of the ""film noir"" genre, I ordered them here after being made aware of them in my amazon recommendations. Glowing reviews and a cheap price made my decision easy.

Well, I won't say I wasted my money, but I was hoping for better. Of the two films, Little Big Horn is by far the superior one. Both Lloyd Bridges and John Ireland are excellent in their respective roles. Though the introduction to the movie is hokey, there is plenty of action and plenty of interpersonal tension between Bridges and Ireland that keeps the viewer on edge. This is true noir as there are no real heroes and no happy ending. My biggest complaint would be that it is too short. I give it four stars.

Then there is Rimfire. This could have been a much better film, but the injection of some buffoonish dolts coupled with some atrociously lame dialogue nearly spoil it. Anyhow, it seems that nearly every prominent person in the frontier hamlet of Stringtown NM is involved in the disappearance of a shipment of government gold. Even the town sheriff is in on the theft. Cardsharps, superstition, and a kangaroo court all have a role in how the story ends. The film does have its moments: a great bar fight and the suspense built by way the gold thieves are eliminated one by one. But the corny comic effect created by the presence of the buffoons spoils any noirish ambience. Two stars.

No recommendation either way. I am delighted to have seen Little Big Horn, but I could have done without Rimfire. If you want to take a chance on it for yourself, the price is right.",1172707200,7,1607,4.515463917525773
2633001,5,B000HC2LMG,"Without a doubt, had LITTLE BIG HORN been released by a major studio, it would have achieved the genre-breaking status that HIGH NOON did a year later.  Fine acting, crisp dialogue and a great script lift this one high above what must have been (knowing Lippert!) a miniscule budget.

This is one of those movies that the local channels showed twice a week, every week during the fifties and early sixties.  It was cut, spliced, stepped on and mistreated by most all that handled it.  I am SURPRISED that VCI and Kit Parker are able to provide such a clean, complete copy of this western treasure.

Among the extras provided on the DVD is a nice selection of posters, lobby cards, and stills, accompanied by the nifty LITTLE BIG HORN theme music.

Since I have now been through combat this picture resonates with me all the more. Much more so than the flash bang , blow everything up movies that they make now.

Most of the other reviewers have actually written far far better criticisms of these 2 films than I a can, but I'll try. As a Western fan for over 50 years I am almost ashamed to say I hadn't seen either of these films before this DVD, tho I had read of them, and I do like Lippert films. So, I got the DVD and I have to say the 2 films are among the most enjoyable I have seen (tho perhaps not quite the ""best""). ""LITTLE BIG HORN"" scores with plot, acting (and my favourite western star Jim Davis in an early role, and Marie Windsor even tho her role is not very big). and Direction by C.M.Warren, always an underrated western director. A good Cavalry/Indians film. The big surprise for me, and here I tend to disagree with a couple of my fellow writers, is RIMFIRE - From the opening title to the corny end this rattles along at almost breakneck speed, apart from a courtroom scene, with a hefty, very noisy fist fight between Reed Hadley and John Cason, and plenty of surprising mystery, and here I must gently crticise one reviewer who shall be nameless for a very real spoiler! I didn't guess who the villain was, but luckily I only read his review after I had seen the film. ""Rimfire"" has a cast of western faces to die for - Glen Strange/Dick Alexander/John Cason/Stan Jolley/Stanley Price/Ray Bennett/Don Harvey/Lee Roberts/Henry Hull, and, sadly, cos his comedy shtick is out of place, Fuzzy Knight.
