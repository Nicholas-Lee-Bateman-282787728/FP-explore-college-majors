5524897,5,B00AX5B0QU,"The ensemble here is great, the boys are more in sync than they have been since Damian and Paul started to phase out (i.e. everything since the first two or three).
The songs are good, the new song director Munro is excellent, his new originals are superb.
A note on Colm, who is new to this CD, since he is the most mysterious aspect. HE IS WONDERFUL! His voice is clear as crystal, and smooth as silk. (Listen to the sample of Katie) Essentially, if you like Emmett then you will like him; not to say that they have identical voices, Emmett is actually deeper and a bit ""harder"", but like Emmett you can understand every word he sings.
Another reviewer said that they wished that Damian or Daniel were there instead of Colm. I am truly sorry to say this, Damian is cute and has a smooth voice and all, but....he doesn't have what Colm does. Colm is just plain better in the ensemble and solo. (Looks-wise he has piercing blue eyes!)
The only gripe I have about this CD/DVD is that Colm only gets one song, I would like another and he should really get two after picking up Ryan's place in Atlantic City last summer after Ryan's accident.
Other than Kieth ruining ""Sounds of Silence"" (the original is actually better, and these guys don't usually mess anything up) the entire thing is great.",1361404800,,1292,4.478813559322034

for 2 days.  The setting is beautiful, the music is wonderful, the performers
just keep getting better and better with each new DVD.  This is a must
have for any Celtic Thunder fan.  I would highly recommend this DVD
to anyone who likes beautiful music, talented performers and
a delightful evening of entertainment!

5524900,5,B00AX5B0QU,"I was lucky enough to receive my copy of Mythology six days before the release as I pre-ordered it from the official site. Yes, there is a deluxe version (which I ordered) which has more tracks and A LOT of bonus footage but for those who either can't afford it or just want the basic version this is perfect.

I have been a fan of Celtic Thunder since the very first show and I have to say that this is the best show to date. The set is very striking and I thought that the stage being a large Celtic cross would be destracting but it adds to the feel of the show and drives the message home that the lads have gone back to their Celtic roots. Add in traditional dancers, powerful musical numbers, and some of the best musicians on the planet and you have a show that can't be described without sitting down and just watching it.

Whether you have been a fan for years or if you've just been introduced to Celtic Thunder you don't want to miss out on 'Mythology'! Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",1360800000,31,1001,4.2356020942408374
5524901,4,B00AX5B0QU,"WARNING: May Contain Spoilers.

Regular is Great but Deluxe version is outstanding, although there are some more familiar songs on the Deluxe such as The House of the Rising Sun, The Thunder Rolls and The Boys of Summer.  Seven Drunken Nights is slightly changed on this album for comedic purposes, lines are the same except George doesn't say his BALD head, he just says head.  Danny Boy is sung by Emmett alone and it starts a bit differently before going into the regular Danny Boy song.

The set is awesome, it has a big celtic cross in the middle of the stage.  One of the best sets since the very first dvd's.

Neil Byrne plays the piano on Rock n Roll Kids which is only on the deluxe version, so if you want to hear and see him play that you will need the deluxe version.  GOOF: They goofed in the printed booklet and sleeve, the booklet says Neil/Ryan performed Rock N Roll Kids and the sleeve says Neil/Colm.  The booklet is correct on this song.  For alot of the songs the booklet and sleeve do not line up on who sings which songs.  They will list 5 singers on one and 4 on the other for instance.  This stuff should be polished and be mistake free before being released.

Colm Keegan: My review on him is simply this, he is better than Paul Byrom, but I'd much rather have Damian Mcginty or Daniel Furlong any day.  It allows you to do more things when having a younger 6th member.

Deluxe version has a 2nd disc as well you don't get in the regular version from Amazon which includes My Land and hour long trip into the lives of the singers and The Making of Mythology which is also an hour long.

This is an outstanding dvd, Celtic Thunder continues to deliver the best everytime.  This one is probably one of the best as only really rehash one song without making changes and that is Seven Drunken Nights, other than that every song is new and the other being Danny Boy is a solo with a new intro verse.

My star rating for the Deluxe Version is: *****
My star rating for the Amazon Version is what I will post officially above.",1358640000,105,2044,4.30890052356021

5524943,5,B00AX5B0QU,"Celtic Thunder is not a new group, but they continue to pick up new fans, so I want to add my voice to those urging newer interested folks to get the deluxe or expanded versions of anything that comes from this group.  Its well worth the extra money, which is nominal considering what you're getting.

As soon as I inserted this DVD into my player, I was treated to a rich stage production of incredible music, sound, and lighting all linked together through outstanding camera work and editing (special kudos to the editing department for putting everything seamlessly together  Ive seen shows that paid far less attention to detail).  The stage itself was very different than anything Ive ever seen before or since; a huge Celtic cross extending toward the audience, with the orchestra positioned on either side.  The performers are choreographed to positions both on the cross, and occasionally on the lower area beside it, with the occasional trip to the end of it (the catwalk, they called it).

The rich voices of the all-male, all adult performers are magnificent.  After years of having a child or teen in the group, first Damian McGinty and then guest-performer Daniel Furlong, this show ushered in a new era of Celter Thunder performers as all adult, and to be perfectly honest, I prefer the mature voices and faces on this production and those they have released since.

The performers:  Colm Keegan was the new boy in this presentation, and he has a voice worthy of the ensemble.  Those striking blue eyes certainly don't hurt, either.  Ive always thought that Emmett Cahill has the best voice that has ever been in the group, and he doesnt disappoint here.  Ill always have a particular soft spot for Ryan Kelly and his thoughtful and expressive performances.  I wish his performance of Streets of New York had been included on this DVD, but alas, no such luck.  It made it to the Mythology CD, but not to the DVD.  Neil Byrne, as always, is a pleasure to watch, and one automatically realizes that he just HAD to be brought up from background player to front man.  His wit, personality, and stellar performances made that a natural transition, and one can only wonder what took so long!  I particularly enjoyed his Rock and Roll Kids duet with Ryan. These two are absolute magic together, and its no wonder that theyve been touring and recording as a duo when not working with CT.  And who doesnt love energetic, flaxen-haired Keith Harkin?  His love for what he does is obvious in every performance, and the Sound of Silence duet with Keegan is a flawless rendition of a great song.  George Donaldson turns in a typically solid performance, as always, but having purchased this DVD only recently, as I watch it I cant help but feel a bit wistful of a life and talent that was cut short.

The deluxe version also contains a second disc with a Making of segment, which includes interviews and examples of every aspect of and all the people involved in putting a show of this magnitude together, from hairdressing and make-up to costuming, and to the stage and sound crews.  The second part of the bonus disc is My Land, and the guys take us around to their favorite places in Ireland, offering beautiful scenery, a song here and there, and sometimes humorous comments. It finishes with brief comments from family members, including Neils brother, Georges wife and daughter, and Ryans mother.

Sorry this is so long, but I cant contain my enthusiasm for these guys.  In short, from Voices to My Land, this is a wonderful production, and if you're thinking of buying, do yourself a favor and get the deluxe.  If you dont, youll wish you had!",1460505600,,3652,4.7133858267716535

This is definitely one of the strongest Celtic Thunder album so far.

5525103,5,B00AX5B0QU,"Despite this being an abridged version, this is an excellent show and may very well be the most professional and well-done CT show to-date. There is a longer version of this show available only from the CT's own website (expensive!), but I think the selections included on this shorter DVD were wisely picked, and the result is a fast-paced and very entertaining show. Although Emmet Cahill has left the group since this DVD was made, another new member, Colm Keegan, is a great addition. The creator of CT, Sharon Browne, definitely has a gift for putting together both artists and music. Whether the singers perform cover songs or original numbers written for them (Brian Kelly's ""Hunter's Moon"" being an example of the latter), I thought each of singers was given a chance to shine. Although rabid CT addicts may want to own the longer version too, I like this shorter Amazon version no less. In fact I have purchased a couple of these DVDs as gifts for friends unfamiliar with CT, and probably helped create a few more Celtic Thunder fans.

Caveat: Be aware that the provided program list has errors and misidentifies some singers. For example, the song ""Katie"" is sung by Colm Keegan, not Neil Byrne as stated in the program. I had to make hand-corrections before mailing out the DVD gifts.",1397347200,5,1295,4.78125

I remember this song and they really did it justice. Ryan ""Hunter's Moon"" is dark. Love having Colm & when he sings ""Katie"" I hope she comes running back too him I know I would. Love ""Turning Away"" by the group its my favorite song. Ryan singing ""The Thunder Rolls"" is better than who song it first. The dancers are great. Neil sings a song ""Carolina Rua"" it is fun to listening too. Ryan & Neils ""Rock & Roll Kids"" I love hearing them sing. Glad it was on the DVD. ""MY Land"" just makes me want to be & Ireland. I got the Deluxe 2 DVD set. And the DVD where the guys show you places in Ireland just makes me want to see Ireland more. It is a beautiful place. I love every CD & DVD. But they just keep getting better. Love are the guys. Bur Ryan you will always be my favorite. And now Colm you are my second. This is a must have DVD.",1377302400,,995,3.955223880597015

5525175,3,B00AX5B0QU,"This show is not up to Celtic Thunder's standards.  They brought back the orchestra which I think is totally unnecessary since they have such a talented group of musicians forming the Celtic Thunder Band.  My only complaint about them is that Barry who does flute and guitar acts so bored onstage.  He acts like it is just a job and shows little or no enthusiasm.  Neil was doing a number called ""Perfect"" and some of the band were forming a small ensemble.  Barry was playing guitar and singing backup.  The others were really getting into the number.  Barry was not.  No smile, no lighthearted look.  NOTHING.  ZERO  Either they need to light a fire under him or replace him.  They have replaced the cello player and this one is much better.

Their number ""Seven Drunken Nights"" wasn't performed nearly as well as it was on ""Voyager II""  Colum doesn't seem able to do comedy at all.  He took over Ryan's segment and was very stiff.  He has a really good voice for ballads, but they have to be careful how they use him.  All in all, Celtic Thunder can do better.",1376438400,,1063,4.481675392670157
5525176,4,B00AX5B0QU,"I love all of Celtic Thunder's dvds, however I don't understand how other people can say this is their best ever.  The Celtic cross was a great idea, but it was too small for the boys to sing on AND the band to be right behind them. That's just how I personally prefer the stage. But the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I missed Keith.  Why wasn't he in the group songs such as ""Star of the County Down"", ""She Moved Thru the Fair"" and ""The Rocky Road to Dublin""; three of my favorite Irish folk songs.  Does anybody out there know why Keith didn't have many songs? Also, there was only one fun song in this dvd.  The songs were very serious, but beautiful.  However, I wish there were a few fun  and lively songs in-between.
Emmett is a great new member.  Great voice and nice smile. I do wish they had a younger member like Damien. The kids have always made it possible to do some fun songs.
  I'm writing this at a later date.  After watching ""Mythology"" a couple more times to figure out why it just isn't as good as the other DVD's, I think I figured it out. As I mentioned before Keith was not in at least three of the ensemble songs.  Even Ryan was only in one.  Keith is the joker; the pest; the funny guy. That's part of it.  Plus,  there wasn't any young member there for him to pick on.  Even when the guys sang ""Rocky Road to London"", which I always considered a fun song,  the guys were very serious!  Additionally,  when I look back to other DVDs the guys seemed to connect more.  When they were doing an ensemble piece, while one lad was singing his solo part, one or more of the other members were looking at him and smiling.  Much more comraderie.  Missing in ""Mythology"". (sorry for misspelling comraderie. I won't be going to the concert when it comes to my town, because of the serious venue the group has taken.  I hope they stay together and go back to their roots (like when they first started). Then, maybe I'll go to see a show.",1375315200,,1961,4.21505376344086

5525178,5,B00AX5B0QU,"Everyone knows how these singers sound.  While I have enjoyed everything they have done (Ryan is my favorite and I missed him when he was gone), this has to be the best since their first performance.

Very disappointed in this, as the pictures is so distorted we could only watch when there were close ups, and then it was horrible as well.

5525196,5,B00AX5B0QU,"The latest from Celtic Thunder and quite possibly their greatest. All new songs and performances by the group. Some stand-outs include Hunter's Moon performed by Ryan Kelly, Isle of Innisfree performed by Emmett Cahill, and both Voices and My Land performed by the Ensemble. A truly great mixture of both original and classic Irish songs, along with some reworkings of some old classics like The Sound of Silence.

I was disappointed that the version I got didn't have all the songs that were shown on PBS.  I guess you had to do the ""pledge thing"" to get the SPECIAL version that PBS made.  But I'M A FAN NOW!

5525204,4,B00AX5B0QU,"I have all of Celtic Thunder's CD's.  This one is good but not their best.  The stage setting is spectacular and some of the songs such as ""The Isle of Innisfree""  and ""Danny Boy"" were the best I have ever heard.  The one drawback for me, as an American, is that I am not familiar with the Celtic myths that are the bases for several songs.  However, the show was filmed in Ireland with a largely Irish audience who obviously knew what the songs were about and were very enthusiastic.  I love the interaction among the performers as well as the audience.  I will continue buying their music for as long as they perform.",1370390400,,619,4.37719298245614

5525212,3,B00AX5B0QU,"We thought the show last year was so good that perhaps we were expecting  too much this year. After viewing the DVD, we won't be going to see CT & Mythology when they are in our area. Except for two songs that we were slightly familiar with,most of the material seemed  difficult to identify with; we couldn't quite make a connection. The content is much different this year; there is no equivalent here to the lovely ""Remember Me"" or the rousing ""A Place in the Choir"". The guys do a fine job with what they have to work with, but my fear is that absent the genius of the incomparable Phil Coulter they will be moving in a different direction.",1369267200,4,644,4.358333333333333

so beautiful, it's almost unbelievable. ""Now We Are Free"" by Keith Harkin is my favorite song but ""Voices"", ""Turning Away"", ""She Moved Through the Fair"" are a close 2nd and the rest are just as great.
I would recommend this CD to everybody who loves good music.",1367539200,,505,4.382978723404255

The mythology collection gets your heart pounding with songs such as voices and turning away, makes you laugh with seven drunken nights, and tears are brought with carickfergus and Danny boy. I truly love absolutely every song in this collection! I wish all the best and I hope they keep these amazingly beautiful shows coming.

I can't quite put my finger on why either. I tend to think there was more heart and less showmanship in the original concerts. The new group of guys are all very talented and have excellent voices; and if I was seeing them for the first time, I would probably be impressed, but I still miss the original crew! That being said, however, I find that this concert is my personal favorite since ""Heritage"" came out. This has songs which seem to match better to the ""old"" way of doing things for them, and I would definitely watch this over ""Voyage"" or some of the other newer ones. Overall, pretty good!",1367193600,,739,4.285714285714286

The talent of the new members, with the exception of Neil who is really an old member, falls well short of the guys they replaced, and the character development and the magical bond among them is gone. With a few exceptions, the music selections are also inferior, replaced by dancers and prancing violin players.

5525250,5,B00AX5B0QU,"In this new release CD, Celtic Thunder has gone back to a more traditional sound, featuring more of the bagpipe and drums type of music.  Some songs are modern compositions that sound like they belong in the past, but there are a few of the old songs on this CD,as well.  The newer compositions are strong anthems to the land that this group loves,  and the songs are sung with pride and brotherly love. .  Newcomer Colm Keegan gives a sweet performance to the song ""Katie,"" while original member Keith Harkin performs ""Tears of Hercules,"" which also appears on his solo CD that was released in the Fall of 2012. There are rousing songs (""The Rocky Road to Dublin"") sung along side sweet ballads (""Carrickfergus"") that are on this CD.

I did not know which were the best songs until I watched mine.  So I returned it and ordered her the deluxe one from Celtic Thunder.  It's a great show.",1366329600,,435,4.2682926829268295

5525259,4,B00AX5B0QU,"I've loved Celtic Thunder since I first discovered the group on Public TV. This CD is a nice follow-on to their previous CDs. My only complaints are 1) that there are too many slow songs on it and 2) that only part of the concert (see the DVD) is on the CD. My guess is that they plan to release a second CD with the other songs, maybe.

The ""Voices"" and ""Turning Away"" numbers are particularly lovely, but there are several good songs on the CD. The ""boys"" are in good form. I was disappointed when Paul left the group a while back, but Emmet has a lovely Irish tenor sound too. I don't know much about Colm, but expect he will ""grow"" into the group. I'm not sure where the Aaron Copeland instrumental number came from, since it's not on the DVD of the concert either, but it should be familiar to anyone who's seen those ""Beef, it's what's for dinner"" commercials.",1366156800,,866,4.3128834355828225

It brings me fond memories of my trip to Ireland a couple of years ago--although the music I witnessed in the pubs there weren't exactly the same quality of perfection that this is.

5525289,3,B00AX5B0QU,"I'd love to be able to write a gushing 5-star review for Mythology, but I just can't.  I like CT and believe this is their best assemblage of members to date, but this show is not my favorite.  I think it falls somewhere in the middle of the pack of all their releases.  Better than Storm and IE, but not as good as Heritage and Voyage.
The tone of this show is far too serious.  There is hardly any on-stage chemistry, camaraderie, and fun between the lads, which is what I enjoy seeing from them.  They don't look natural.  At all.  Their movements are so rigid and regimented and their facial expressions are so blank.  Is standing like a statue and staring straight ahead supposed to be entertaining?  I don't get it.  These guys are capable of SO much more, making them statue-stand and stare is a horrific waste of talent.
They look like strangers who just came together for this 1 time to make this DVD.  They take a few robotic strides, stand like statues, stare, sing a few lines, move, stand, stare, sing.  I like the shows better where they are free to move about and improvise and act like their natural selves.  I like THEM, not some act they are trying to portray.

The other issue I have is that there are way too many slow, sleepy, melancholy songs.  You just about get lulled to sleep until Neil's ""Perfect"" perks things up a little.  Even their ""fun"" song 7DN is flatter than the previous version.
Where are the great harmonies?  Where's the spine-tingling acapella number?  Where's the fun sing-along clap-along song?  George picks up the pace near the end which is great, if you make it that far.
""She Moved Thru the Fair"" is odd and moany.  I keep waiting for this song to start, but it doesn't.  It just drags along to a merciful end.
""Rocky Road"" is harsh and SHOUTY.  With such great vocalists in CT - why choose this song that makes them yell?
""County Down"" is too musical theater for me.  Again, they are such great singers why take the focus off of the singing and turn it to their little play?
""Voices"" makes them sound confused and disconnected from the audience.  After ""Heartland"" and ""Dulaman"" I was sure I was going to get a super show.  After ""Voices"", I don't know...THEY don't seem to know.  Why are they there?  What are we doing?  Where are we going?  Why am I watching this show?
In ""Hunter's Moon"" Ryan looks as if he's in pain and distress.  Very unpleasant to watch.

Many of the remainder are ok, but forgettable.  Snoozy-but-nice.  It seems like every step, every look, every blink of the eye was planned to the nth degree and they weren't allowed to be themselves.  The best example of what's missing is found in ""Perfect"".  It's a much happier, natural, enjoyable performance that should be the norm, not the exception.  Bravo Neil and ""Perfect"".

One of the aspects of the show that I really liked was the way different groupings of the lads were used.  Duets, Quartets, Quintets, Solos, full ensembles.  Really liked that.

There are some very good songs, the best of which are ""My Land"", ""Innisfree"", ""Perfect"", ""Sound of Silence"", and ""Turning Away"". But their old magic isn't here.  There's no ""Caledonia's"" or ""Steal Away's"" or ""Galway Gal's"" to be found here.  The singers are great, there are some fine performances, but as a whole, this show does not have the energy and excitement and mesmerizing magic of previous shows.
In spite of my criticism, Mythology is worth getting if you're already a fan as there are some very good performances.  These guys are good, no question but honestly, I enjoyed the Sandy video WAY more than Mythology.  In Sandy I felt like they were their real selves, not pre-programmed androids.
I wish them every success with Mythology, but it missed the mark for me.",1364774400,3,3748,4.588235294117647

5525301,5,B00AX5B0QU,"After seeing all of Celtic Thunder DVD performances, this one wins the five stars without any hesitation. It's the kind of musical event that grabs you, drags you in and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling. The musical arrangements are fantastic, the songs which harmonize the lads' voices are the best ever and the solos are fun, emotional or intense- take your pick, there is something for everyone. Of course there are one or two songs that are borrowed from the American folklore, which I could do without (House of the Rising sun, or A man of constant sorrow), but hey, I guess they have to make the American audiences happy. The stage settings are beautiful, I loved the projected animations beying played in the background for each song, and the new band, minus Paul and Damian, has magic and hopefully will remain the official band for the next few years, unless some of the guys decide they want to play it solo (which, considering what I've heard from them so far, might be a mistake). I would advise to get the Deluxe set from CT website, though, as the DVD from Amazon doesn't have the whole concert. Plus, you'll get an extra hour with the guys showing you which part of Ireland they come from, and a documentary about the ""behind the scenes"" life. A must for all Thunderheads.",1364342400,3,1299,4.603448275862069

I feel they don't need all the fancy staging, though perhaps this was a special production. I'm not sure how to put this but their other shows just felt more audience friendly. The fancy stage and the orchestra just were, for me, more a distraction than entertaining. I also miss a younger member being included in the group (no Damian or Daniel in this one).  I admit I like the slower, meloncholy songs, but I love the happy, fun songs and this show does not have very many of them. Still, this is Celtic Thunder and I recommend any fans of these guys will want to include this one in their collection, even if it does short change you on the songs (20 here compared to 31 from the complete show).",1363824000,,801,4.34

Not a day goes by that I haven't had one or another of the songs going through my head making me want to either watch the DVD again or listen to the CD (yes, I also purchased it). Mythology is that good.

New member Colm Keegan is a worthy addition. He has a wonderful voice that blends well with the other members. When the six of them perform together you get some amazing harmonies. I haven't heard harmonies like that in I don't know how long.

While this version only contains about two thirds of the show it is well worth the price. Although I do wish it contained  ""The Boys Are Back In Town"" performed by Keith, Ryan, Emmett and Neil. Colm also gave a wonderful performance of  ""The Edge of the Moon"" that is not included.

5525348,1,B00AX5B0QU,"This review is mainly for people who are not already committed Celtic Thunder fans. The primary people buying Mythology are die hard fans of Celtic Thunder who call themselves ""Thunderheads"", and this is likely who all of the positive reviews are coming from. In my experience from the shows I've attended, most of these fans are just ""older lady"" versions of Justin Bieber, teeny-bopper, type fans in that they are rabid so they don't generally care what Celtic Thunder does just so long as they do it in front of them. These fans are not objective and therefore rate everything highly that Celtic Thunder does regardless of the quality of the show or the performances. I expect to receive many negative comments to this review from ""Thunderheads"", unless this last sentence discourages them from proving my point about their rabid and subjective natures.

I have really enjoyed Celtic Thunder in the past but I'm very disappointed that their quality is on a huge downward spiral. They have become very cheesy which has more to do with production and direction than the singers. As always, the singers are talented and have wonderful voices but the shows are losing their integrity. Their quality is only one step up from that of an American ""Irish Pub's"" regular house band. I think they have dropped to a level more suited for a ""Las Vegas"" type lounge act in Reno or Laughlin, Nevada for drunken tourists seeking a break from the gambling. I used to see all of their shows when they toured but wouldn't pay $20 in Reno to see them now. Ironically, they have done a run in Atlantic City which is really out of their league, as is Las Vegas. They should work on a long term gig in Reno to milk every last cent they can out of this tired, past-its-prime show. However, if cheesy lounge singers with their pointy-finger, wink-wink, jazz-hands-pizzazz is your thing, then you may love the new Celtic Thunder. I'll keep an open mind and acknowledge that some people do enjoy that.

I, personally, love a great authentic Irish band and Celtic Thunder once was great but they are now a caricature of their former-selves. It's such a shame too and I'm sad to see them slipping. A couple of the former members have left and they've replaced them with new singers who are fantastic! It's just too bad that they joined the show too late. There's no integrity anymore in the direction of the show and it's clear it's more about the money these days. What a sad decline to such a wonderful show.

I gave this one star as the singers voices are worthy of the one star alone but the production/direction is a zero. The best part of this DVD is the tour of Ireland, but that's not saying much. I'm thankful I saw it first before buying my own as it would have been a complete waste of money. I have gotten into the habit now of not buying Celtic Thunder's new releases until I've sampled the work first. I recommend you do the same.",1363305600,8,2919,4.588122605363985

I have all the CT DVD's, none of which have ever caused be to doze off, and most of the CD's.  Of all the DVD's Storm is the only stage performance that would rank lower than this one.  I loved the first two, and It's Entertainment was just fantastic, I loved all the dance interpreted covers of the various genres of music.  This release was touted as being as big and better than the original first two videos, but it was no where near that.  The original Shows that were filmed were done on multi-tier stages and the first one was enormous.  The videography was not as clean and smooth either.  I am an avid CT fan and love all the music, from original Celtic inspired covers to actual Celtic style music and song.  This Concert seemed disconnected in too many ways.  I still enjoyed parts of it but it is by no means, in  my opinion, their best nor does it come close.",1362441600,2,1022,4.131979695431472

Set against a dramatic Celtic cross, the lads choose a wide variety of songs which fit their individual styles and showcase where they've come from and where they're going.  From the dramatic opening number, ""Voices,""which bounces seamlessly back and forth among the lads in harmony, to the closing, haunting ""Our Land,"" you are on a vocal tribute to all things Celtic past and present.  They have country, folk, rock, and traditional Irish music to choose from.  There is also all price points from the Deluxe Edition, offered by PBS and the Celtic Thunder site, to this Amazon site, to Walmart and Target.

5525369,5,B00AX5B0QU,"When I first saw the DVD I didn't think too much of it because a lot of the music was new, BUT I decided to watch it 4-5 times just to see if I would change my mind, and I did.  Sometimes you get stuck in certain songs, and it takes a while to adjust to new ones (like I did), but it happens.  They have come so far since their first few albums that they are a joy to watch because they actually have a good time.  I also bought 2 cd's, one for myself and one for my daughter.  Keith's version of ""I am a man of constant sorrow"" is true ""bluegrass"" music that is generally heard down south, but didn't he and Neil have a good time singing it?  You can venture outside of Celtic music and find some good songs, along with old ones.  I have to say since David Munro appeared on the scene all their music has a lot of ""pep"" and good music.  Emmet's version of ""Danny Boy"" bought tears to my eyes like it usually does for me, and I'm sure others.  Please, guys, don't anyone leave CT for years to come.  Just let us sit back and enjoy you and your music.",1362096000,,1050,3.938388625592417

George did a superb job with Scarlet Ribbons and My Land ended the CD well but inbetween  songs were repeated material and very dry and dramatic fluff.

5525375,4,B00AX5B0QU,"Reviewed the CD with only 4 stars earlier without watching the DVD. The DVD is much more enjoyable. Their personalities come out in the song selections. Neil's ""Carolia Rua"" is great as is Colm's ""Katie"" and Keith's ""Hercules"" (which is also on his solo CD). George's ""Scarlett Ribbons"" is a strange arrangement, but George pulls it off nicely. Emmet does a wonderful job with ""Danny Boy"" but I like the earlier version with all the boys. Ryan's ""Hunter's Moon"" shows his vocal talent more than any other song he's performed thus far. The set is beautiful, but the show is not quite up to their previous shows. The screens behind the performers are a bit distracting. All in all, I like this show and the songs are growing on me, but it's missing something from their previous shows.",1361750400,3,783,4.681159420289855

5525377,4,B00AX5B0QU,"This is another great DVD from Celtic Thunder.  The songs were very good and while I love that they do some modern songs, I love the irish/celtic songs more :-)  Celtic Thunder The Show, Heritage and Voyage are my favorite DVDs and Mythology will also be another favorite.  I particularly loved She Moved Through The Fair; Emmett has a great voice for that song.  I was pleased to see Now We Are Free (people may recognize it as it was the theme song for the film, Gladiator) and Keith did a beautiful job singing the song - I'd love to see more songs like that!  Ryan did a great job with Carrickfergus and Hunter's Moon.  Seven Drunken Nights is pretty funny, you can see that the boys are enjoying themselves.  All the boys do a great job and all contribute something to the group.  I have been a fan of Celtic Thunder since the beginning and I'm always excited when a new DVD or CD is out.  I can't for their next tour; their performances are always enjoyable and entertaining.",1361664000,8,981,4.405555555555556

5525379,4,B00AX5B0QU,"I am a litle disappointed in Mythology, one being that at times the orchestra overpowers the singers. Also the singers at times sound as if the recording mic's are in the back of the auditrium and not on stage. Colin is good but I agree with another reviewer Damian or Daniel were better, but again that is a personal preference. Neal, Colin, Keith, Ryan, George and Emmett are again outstanding.

5525381,5,B00AX5B0QU,"From the first time I saw Celtic Thunder perform on a PBS Special, I've been hooked.  As fans, we've heard hints of something new coming, but just whispers about it, and nothing concrete about the direction.  When they announced ""it"" would be in February, I could barely wait.  Since it got here last week, I've played the DVD repeatedly.  It is obvious that Sharon Browne and David Munro of Celtic Thunder have hit yet another one out of the park with ""Mythology.""  Their talent has been to put the best people that they can find together, and let them do what they do best. Even the Mythology set is new and different - a huge Celtic Cross along with replicas of ancient stones on which appear visions of the past or the future. In an age where everything is run by computers, this whole undertaking represents the best of technology along with a practiced-eye toward what works well on stage.

Two years ago, when they lost two popular members of the group, there was some question about whether or not CT could take the hit - particularly since Ryan Kelly had already stepped back due to what was first described as personal problems, but what was later revealed to be threats made to he and his family by a deranged fan.  They proved they could, and with the ""promotion"" of Neil Byrne, the return of Ryan Kelly, and the addition of Emmett Cahill, proved it well! ""Voyage"" and ""Voyage II"" were as strong, if not more so, and the new ""sound"" was, to me, even better.  You wondered how they could top THAT...and along came the whispers of something that was to come...""Mythology.""  The harmonies on ""Mythology"" are just incredible, and much of the time you can't even pick out the solo voices in the group numbers.  There's also another new performer, Colm Keegan.

Colm auditioned for a future position with the group and their intent was to bring him along slowly.  It was a good thing that they had, because Ryan Kelly, ""The Dark Destroyer"" sustained an injury at home last summer which landed him in a local hospital in an induced coma for 3 weeks.  Keegan stepped up and with but a few rough edges at first, has come into his own with ""Mythology.""  Luckily, Ryan healed quickly and although he looks a bit peaked, you won't know unless you look for it.  The Deluxe version of the DVD contains an extra CD of the lads showing you the Ireland they love.  It's a bit of fun, and it's obvious that they like each other and have good times together.  The second part of the Deluxe edition is about the making of ""Mythology.""  It's not the fluff piece that so many DVD's have - it's each and every person who is a part of this effort, showing you just what it is they do - even the wardrobe mistress is shown ""dressing"" the Rookie, Keegan.  Great fun!  It's nice to see the mums and grand-mums, cousins and friends, and it is obvious that they are proud of CT - as they should be!

Whenever I've purchased a CD or a DVD, there are usually one or more tracks that I'm not very fond of.  That's not so with ""Mythology.""  From the first ""Voices"" calling you in, everything is beautifully lit, high-energy musical theatre at its best.  Colm Keegan's version of ""Katie"" is almost haunting it's so ethereal, as is ""The Edge of the Moon.""  I only wish I was 21 again - those blue eyes are to die for!  Since he first replaced Paul Byrom, Emmet Cahill has made his own of the role of ""The Irish Tenor.""  His ""Isle of Innisfree"" and ""Danny Boy"" give you a new look at the Irish Favorites - he literally lives the roles as he sings them, especially with the intro on ""Danny Boy"".

In ""Mythology"" you'll see Ryan's return to the role of ""Dark Destroyer"", but there's another level of feeling there.  Perhaps it is due to his fear for his family's safety or it's his reality that life can end so quickly, but in either case, ""Carricfergus"" ""House of the Rising Sun"" and ""The Thunder Rolls"" all have a new dimension to them.  I've loved watching Neil grow as a musician and a soloist, bringing us the best of his Irish wit, and the beautiful ""Carolina Rua"" from his solo album.  Keith continues to amaze with cuts from his solo album showing up in ""Mythology.""  ""Tears of Hercules"" is beautiful - and if you get the CD, make note of the fact that David Foster does the piano accompanyment.  George Donaldson does ""Scarlet Ribbons"" and if I had to pick a favorite, this would be it, because it reminds me of my own dad singing it along with the radio when I was a little girl.  ""The Grande Affaire"" is also a strong number.

The solos on this DVD are all unique, but it's the duets and the rollicking-fun ensemble pieces where Celtic Thunder shines.  The band and the dancers get you stomping your feet and clapping to a rollicking ""Hoedown"" and ""Lonesome Boatman into Reels.""  It's classically-Irish and when you watch Declan O'Donoghue just banging away on his drums and the rest of the musicians having fun too, you really want to jump up and join in.  Belinda Murphy has choreographed this show as well - she knows just how to move everyone around on the stage, making it look natural and gay...or moody and touching at the same time.  I love ""Star of the County Down"" and keep humming ""The Rocky Road to Dub-u-lin 1-2-3-4-5"" - you just can't figure out how on earth they can get all the words in without losing their breath! (If you watch the accompanying DVD in the Deluxe Edition, David Munro will show you how!)

I feel as though I'm gushing...as I write about one song, another one comes to mind.  Let me finish by saying that from the first moment you hear ""Voices"" through to the anthem, ""My Land,"" at the end, you will find song after song, solo after solo and ensemble pieces as well, that you'll have trouble figuring out which YOU like the best. I hope you'll enjoy their performance as much as I have.  Celtic Thunder - you continue to be an experience more than just a band, and I thank you so very much for all you've put into ""Mythology.""  It was nice to see your families, and touching to see their pride in you so evident.  Can't wait for the Fall Tour!",1361577600,82,6061,4.431407942238267
5525382,5,B00AX5B0QU,"I must say that my ancestry being from Ballymina in County Antrim I just simply had to have the DVD of Mythology by
this so very talented group. However I did not know there was a Deluxe version of it. If anyone reading this review could
tell me where to purchae it please do let me know. Hopefully I can also purchase it on Amazon. I have every other DVD of this group that was ever made. I do have my favorites which are ""Its Entertainment"" and ""Heritage"".I like the comeradime on
those two. I also miss Damien and don't see why they can't have 7 singers in the group. My sister-in-law thinks that Paul
was wonderful. It seems he was to appear somewhere in or near Philadelphia and since she lives in Warsaw Pa. she was
anxious to see him perform. I really have no favorite since they are all so talented but I did miss DeClan having a drumming duel with Barry Kerr. Incidently my brochure for this one listed Barry Kerr on pipes and whistles but quite frankly he
did not look like Barry to me. I was so pleased that the kilts are back. Love it. Also I never get tired of hearing the song Ireland no matter how many times I hear it. This group is so talented that it is easy to become addicted to them. I am
just waiting for the day they come to South Bend Indiana. They were here about the first time they appeared on PBS but
I was ill at the time and could not go to see them. I understand they put on a fantastic show when appearing in
venues here in the U.S.",1361577600,,1464,4.1223776223776225

5525384,5,B00AX5B0QU,"I love this DVD, the songs are all beautiful and often have a haunting quality to them. The guys are clearly enjoying themselves and that makes it very enjoyable to watch. I also really like the fact that the majority of the songs are on the CD as well so I know the words and I'm not frustrated that some of my favorite songs aren't on the CD, though I really wish Bridge Over Troubled Waters was on the CD, Colm and Keith do such an excellent job on it!",1361404800,,455,4.066666666666666

8558720,3,B00AX5B0QU,In the Description for this it said there were 20 songs and was 1 hour and 45 minutes. The DVD I received has only 12 songs. I have not played this. I have the two DVD Original but it somehow got scratched. I had it professionally cleaned but it didn't fix it. I have 10 of the CT DVDS and of course because this one is twice the price of the others it is the only one that won't clean.,1498694400,,386,3.8375
