8223748,4,B00005RV8X,"I had been looking for a simple yet effective yoga workout, to get me back into the habit. I had previously attended classes, but had forgotten some of the basics. Rodney's teaching style makes you feel like he is right there with you. He is soothing with his voice, and gives constant reminders to relax the face and neck, while keeping the breathing consistent. He mentions the name of each pose casually when going through the routine, making it very easy to pick up on and remember. I really enjoyed following this video and would reccomend it to any beginner, or someone looking to refresh their yoga memory. :)",1078185600,17,616,4.660550458715596
