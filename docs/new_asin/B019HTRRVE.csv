7575807,5,B019HTRRVE,Great movie. Really reflects the communist paranoia of the 1950s-1960s. Excellent acting. Totally weird dialog between Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh when they first meet -- I thought maybe she was a spy exchanging pass phrases. Enjoy!,1467158400,,234,5.351351351351352
7575808,5,B019HTRRVE,"There's not much more that can be said about John Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate""(1962) that hasn't already been said countless times before since the film's original release. Critics and film historians have praised the film with many considering it one of the greatest films ever made. Frankenheimer's masterpiece has certainly stood the test of time and may be even more relevant today than when it was first released. Whether Frankenheimer knew it at the time or not, the film has turned out to be very prophetic considering the ""brainwashing"" of many individuals of various terror groups around the world today. If he were alive today, Frankenheimer would be the first to admit that not much has changed when it comes to the socio-political environment in America and might say that it's gotten worse. ""Candidate"" is not only a political satire but also a neo-noir thriller that has a lot in common with Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove""(1964). Criterion has now released ""The Manchurian Candidate"" on Blu-ray and the results are simply astounding. According to the liner notes from the enclosed booklet: ""This new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution from the original camera negative at Deluxe. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed"" and Criterion has given the film a high bitrate(34.91). The results are a pristine picture from start to finish. There are some out of focus shots of Frank Sinatra(mainly during the hotel confrontation scene with Laurence Harvey toward the end of the film)  but it has nothing to do with the film elements or Criterion's immaculate Blu-ray presentation. This out of focus scene of Sinatra is explained by Frankenheimer during his commentary. Sinatra only liked to do one or two takes of a scene and this was the ""rough cut"" or first take which he thought was better than the second take that Sinatra did. I  hope that makes sense. Other than this one scene, the B&W cinematography by Lionel Lindon is a wonder to behold on Blu-ray with even the smallest details being crystal clear and vivid. You can read the titles of the books in Sinatra's apartment that are on the table and clearly see the medals and ribbons of the officers uniforms. The acting is top notch with Frank Sinatra and especially Laurence Harvey giving the best performances of their careers. However, as good as they are in their roles, it's Angela Lansbury that walks away with the top acting honors in her role as the wicked, sinister and incestuous mother of Laurence Harvey's character(In reality, she was only three years older than Harvey). It's one of the greatest performances ever put on film(However, if Sinatra had gotten his way Lansbury would never have gotten the part. Sinatra wanted Lucille Ball but Frankenheimer overruled him). The main stars get great support from Janet Leigh, James Gregory, Henry Silva and John McGiver.  The Audio(English LPCM mono) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts. Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35 mm optical soundtrack negative. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum and crackle were manually removed."" Overall, this is another outstanding Blu-ray  presentation from Criterion. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is 126 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.75:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special Features include an audio commentary from director John Frankenheimer; a 2015 interview with Angela Lansbury(11 minutes); an interview with filmmaker Errol Morris(17 minutes); an interview with Frankenheimer, Sinatra, and screenwriter George Axelrod(8 minutes); an interview with historian Susan Carruthers(21 minutes) and the theatrical trailer. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed a the standard clear Criterion case. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is one of the great film of all time and Criterion's new Blu-ray should be a welcome addition to everyone's film library. It comes very highly recommended.",1465689600,8,4004,5.2810047095761385

7575812,5,B019HTRRVE,"Criterion's Blu-ray release of this classic film is the one to buy. Image and sound are exceptional. Supplements are sparse but excellent, including a recent interview with Angela Lansbury talking about working with director John Frankenheimer ; Frank Sinatra (who apparently wouldn't tolerate doing more  than one or two takes of a scene) and commenting on her role in the film, one of the great screen villains in movies. The film is chilling and has stood the test of time. Indeed, it seems even more relevant and topical now than it did upon its release in 1962.",1460764800,3,566,4.835051546391752

7575816,5,B019HTRRVE,"This is an excellent well-made and well-acted psycho-thriller. It's deliberately in black and white to add to the effect, but at least Janet Leigh in her prime is the beautiful blonde who seduces and is seduced by Frank Sinatra instead of getting stabbed multiple times. Angela Lansbury, the only star still living, does a great interview in the excellent special features section common to these fine Criterion Collection Blu-ray restorations. Lansbury plays a downright scary and ruthlessly ambitious character, but is noticeably just as young as Lawrence Harvey, who plays her frighteningly ""brainwashed"" son. Accepting the degree of psychological manipulation depicted for him and Sinatra requires suspension of some disbelief,  but if one can get past that, this is an excellent film of its genre. I figured out the supposedly surprise ending as soon as I had the relevant information, as most other mystery-watchers will, but I didn't find it detracting. The repeated dream sequences were especially imaginative and well done.",1494547200,2,1032,5.409937888198757
7575817,4,B019HTRRVE,"The Manchurian Candidate, 1962 Film

Richard Condon gained fame with his 1959 novel, which was adapted into a film in 1962 (scenes were shot in Manhattan). This story seemed like science fiction, until we learned about Government experiments in the 1970s. Could a person be hypnotized and made to commit murder? I think the answer is yes. But I doubt that the fiction of this film could ever become fact. You should look upon this story as a fable and satire about politics and life.

The opening scenes telegraph that there is something wrong with Raymond Shaw. The scene with the gardening ladies symbolizes use of the military for the wishes of the ruling class. The nightmare of Major Marko tells you that all plans have their faults in the real world. The truth is that the military does teach its recruits to kill on command, and not to suffer guilt afterwards. But it doesnt always work; post traumatic stress syndrome is the result. Humans aren't machines. Showing traveling by train really dates this film!

The idea behind this film is that of subversion: the leading anti communists are really Communist agents! Certainly there have been examples of high level officials who were found to be spies; but they were usually working in the background, avoiding publicity. Markos attack on Chong Jee shows how military conditioning can be carried over into civilian life. Eugenias pickup of Major Marko suggests an E. Phillips Oppenheim story; an intelligence officer should be suspicious of a friendly stranger on a train.

There is symbolism that is troubling. Raymonds mother and step father are assassinated at the end, but they are Communist spies so its all right. But it raises a question: if a high government official is regarded as a Communist, does this justify killing him? JFKs policies, or sympathies, made some regard him as an agent of Communism. JFK wanted to end the 27.5% oil depletion allowance, advance civil rights, have peaceful relations with the Soviet Union, issue $100 Treasury Notes, etc. Some members of the ruling classes hated him for this. After 11 22 1963 this film was considered too controversial to be seen by the public. This novel will be filmed again; I wonder how the story will be changed for modern times?

The costume party shows how opposing politicians can get together and socialize in their spare time. Is politics just another play put on to amuse and distract the voting public? This film portrays politicians as prime movers, not as puppets beholden to their political bosses. [The final scene in the convention auditorium was repeated in The Parallax View.] Could a politician sacrifice a child for votes? Dashiell Hammetts The Glass Key suggests this could happen. Another troubling feature is placing the solution in the hands of the military (Seven Days in May). Using a foreign made rifle for the assassination must have put an idea into somebodys future plan. Yunte Huangs book Charlie Chan noted that Richard Condon was a publicist for the movie industry since 1936. His 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate echoed Sax Rohmers 1936 novel President Fu Manchu. I wonder if the original story of a lost patrol that led to political success was a subtle parody of PT-109?",1492387200,,3229,4.928308823529412

8745287,5,B019HTRRVE,"For me, 1962 was the greatest year in movie history, and The Manchurian Candidate is right at the top of the list of great films that came out in that year.  It was shocking back then and it is still shocking and even more timely now than it was then.  Angela Lansbury's performance is one for the ages, but everyone is perfect - Sinatra, Leigh, Harvey, McGiver, and all the other fantastic actors - and if there's ever been a more heartbreaking performance of little screen time than Leslie Parrish's I haven't seen it.  Frankenheimer's direction has been ripped off so many times by so many lesser talents, but this really was a groundbreaking film in so many ways.  I've owned it in every home video format and had been really disappointed in the first Blu-ray transfer, but Criterion, who paid for a new 4K scan, finally gives this film the visual treatment it deserves - I actually took my breath away - the difference is HUGE.",1519344000,,932,4.562874251497006

8745290,5,B019HTRRVE,"There are works of fiction whose very name can conjure up images and meaning for people who have never even experienced them. The Manchurian Candidate, the 1962 film based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel, is one such example. The film's title has entered into the public consciousness, a term for brainwashing and seemingly incomprehensible betrayal in common use. Yet how many of those who use the term have seen the film and experienced what is likely to be one of the best thrillers of its era or any other?

Part of what makes the film so successful is, perhaps paradoxically, the fact its based on a novel. Having read Condon's original novel a couple of years ago and then coming back to the film a couple of times subsequently, it is amazing to see how much of it makes its way into the film. It's not just brushstrokes that make their way in but entire scenes with large portions of dialogue presented with little edits made to them (the much discussed first scene between Marco and Rosie is a prime example). Even some of the costuming choices are drawn straight from Condon's novel. Scriptwriter George Axelrod is able to take the dark comedy of Condon's novel and put it into what is essentially a thriller that satirizes the McCarthyism of the previous decade and makes it all work together. Not everything makes it into the film of course but much of what makes the film memorable (the plot and dialogue especially) is owed to its source material and the wise decision of Axelrod in keeping as much of it as possible.

Axelrod's script is only part of what makes The Manchurian Candidate the film that it is. Part of it is, of course, the cast. Frank Sinatra was a solid choice for the role of Major Marco who finds himself first facing a potential phantom from his past before realizing that he, and the country he serves, is facing a much larger threat. Laurence Harvey was likewise a good choice for the always odd and never quiet normal Raymond Shaw whom is at the center of the film's plot. Though given a top credit, Janet Leigh's Eugenie Rose Chaney actually doesn't have much to do in the film except perhaps be a romantic foil for Sinatra and a bit of a red herring but Leigh shines in what scenes she does have thanks to her chemistry with Sinatra. The supporting cast is solid as well from James Gregory as the bombastic McCarthy like Senator Iselin to John McGiver as his rival Senator Jordan with Henry Silva, Khigh Dheigh, and Albert Paulsen in roles of varying villainy. There is one other name that needs to be mentioned though.

Because, perhaps oddly, the real star of the film is credited fourth in the film's title sequence. Angela Lansbury's performance as Raymond's mother has become something legendary and not without good reason. Despite being not much older than Harvey was when the film was made and made to look the part thanks to what must have been some excellent make-up, Lansbury was perfect casting for the role. For those who only know her from Murder, She Wrote will be in for a shock as they see the same often quiet determination give in to bouts of conniving manipulation across much of the film's running time. Mrs. Iselin is the power behind the throne, quietly moving pieces around while those around her (namely her senator husband and son Raymond) take the credit. Yet few things will prepare the unsuspecting viewer for the revelations that pile up towards the end of the film including a scene that is every bit as recoiling now as it must have been in 1962. It is no surprise that she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as it still stands as one of cinema's greatest villains.

Last but definitely not least, are those behind the camera. The stark black and white cinematography of Lionel Lindon serves the film well with its neo-noir feel that uses shadows and interesting angles to suggest how 'off' things often are. That is especially true when combined with the editing of Ferris Webster and when the two are combined during the film's lecture scenes or with the climactic sequence at the convention, the results are truly stunning. Director John Frankenheimer brought together a fine team to help him bring Condon's novel to the screen and his work on the film stands as among the best of his long career and there is little doubt that it stands up so well as a result of his work.

All of this combines to make The Manchurian Candidate both an excellent thriller and a fine film. From Axelrod's adaptation of Condon's idiosyncratic novel right down to its dialogue, the performances of the entire cast, and the direction of Frankenheimer, the film is a masterclass on how to adapt a novel to the screen faithfully and yet tell a tense and utterly enthralling story at the same time. It's no wonder that it has become not just a touchstone for films but in the culture at large for it is simply a well made and enjoyable piece of work ever after fifty-five years.",1495843200,4,4939,4.627137970353478
