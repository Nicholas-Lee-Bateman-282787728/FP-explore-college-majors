8742566,5,B018JLQLUE,"My favorite ""Jesus"" movie! In most movies, the character Jesus is cold and untouchable. I love this movie because it shows Him as a warm and ""real"" person who plays with children, teases the disciples, etc. The end was very different, but I liked it as we are all God's children and the modern day scene of Jesus with the children reflects this truth. Terrific acting and true to historical and Biblical events.",1517356800,,411,4.6438356164383565
8742567,5,B018JLQLUE,"I loved it! It was one of the best portrayals of Jesus I've seen. You see Jesus showing human emotions such as laughing, playing, dancing and demonstrating love for his parents and friends.  I especially loved the section on the wedding at Cana. This is also one of my favorite gospels. Although, Jesus didn't feel that His time had come for Him to begin His ministry, He did as His mother asked. The wedding party was out of wine and He came to the rescue by turning the water into wine. Jesus also showed grief and sadness, especially when his good friend Lazarus was ill and died. He cried upon finally getting to His friend's tomb, but brought him back to life. Jesus is seen through most aspects of humanity; especially the ones we value highly. The movie was touching and informative but the best part was seeing Jesus' humanity. It was something you could relate to and feel a kinship with Him.",1496016000,3,901,4.52760736196319
