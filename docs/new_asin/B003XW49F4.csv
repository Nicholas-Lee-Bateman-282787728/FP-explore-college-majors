8408564,2,B003XW49F4,I thought that a DVD would be better than a book to improve my ref skills but in this case I was disappointed. The DVD really only covers basics and not even all of those. If you are thinking about upgrading then this DVD will not help. On the other hand if you are a new ref then there might be something useful in here.,1447113600,4,321,3.953846153846154
