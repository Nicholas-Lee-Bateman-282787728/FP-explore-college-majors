Amazingly enough it was actually inspired by a zombie calendar full of 12 tips to survive the outbreak that the had put out. A calendar into a movie? Yes that's how this one was based and with it being filmed as it was, you can easily see why! It was shot in the style of classic educational instructional videos that you could picture being shown in class to learn what to do or avoid in any scenario. To add into the 'older' instructional feel they also add a bit of graininess to the film as well as interesting cuts between sections including a few commercials that fit the style and budget of the film that show it was sponsored by Ziggurat Chemical.

While there isn't much on the gore scale this is of course an instructional video for the children. Proper education shouldn't scar them for life but prepare them for what is to come. Obviously though it's rare to have a zombie film without ANY killing and they need to reinforce the point that anyone can get infected. For those of you that have seen Fido it's the best comparison that I can make - this feels like it could have been lifted directly from the movie. It's easily something that could have been show in the children's classes and fit well with the introduction to the film. Actually if I were into video editing I would try to splice this in just to see how it looked!",1348963200,,1419,4.395437262357414
