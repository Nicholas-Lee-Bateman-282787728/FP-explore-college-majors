736898,4,6303890423,"Something to Talk About is the sort of movie that is saved by the cast. If it had not been for the work of people like Roberts, Duvall, Quaid, Sedgwick and others, this movie would hardly have been worth watching.  Especially Kyra Sedgwick did a wonderfull job, but than she had all the  good lines. Good work with the horses too and Dennis Quaid shows a  surprising talent in handling children. The story itself is not very  special, but the actors make the best of it, producing a pleasant comedy  with rather more points of interest than is usual.",951868800,6,550,4.515151515151516

737035,4,6303890423,"This film is an enjoyable way to spend some time. Watch it with someone you love, or just enjoy a bit of time with Julia as she tries to get her life back on track. It's a simpler way to view the life of a woman who thought she'd be in one place, then finds out she ended up somewhere else. Life isn't what we always think it will be. But when the signs are there, when we wake up and recognize the truth, we have a choice. Watch as Julia figures out which one to make. It's a lovely film. This isn't intellectual, it isn't a Savannah tour guide. It's a simple and charming story. Great for Saturday evening.",1513555200,,608,4.075

737232,5,6303890423,"I have always LOVED this movie, and I just had to own it. I am a Southern author (SWEET TEA AND TIME, et. al.), and I adore great Southern stories--ones that are authentic--and this one is!  The story centers around actual Southern motifs, like family bonds, great food, horse farming, and traditions. I love the way the movie accurately portrays the Southern culture--unlike in some other movies. It even has an eccentric aunt on full display (I won't tell you what she suggests to ""fix"" her niece's marriage), but it's pretty crazy (and funny). One of my favorite parts is when the father ""marks his territory."" Though the movie has lots of realistic scenes, it is also peppered with enough humorous scenes that you'll be laughing throughout.",1489449600,3,744,4.858267716535433

perfect. Julia Roberts gives one of her best performances in the movie, and Dennis Quaid is so charming, smooth, and really handsome! I

Given this ridiculous, acceptable practice among her friend's, her father( hey, it's business) and her mother (who was also cheated on, but accepts it as part of marriage and tells her daughter to do the same). I have never been more offended by a movie than I am over this sexist drivel.
I do agree about throwing this away, but not because of the mild swearing, but the horrific message it would send to my daughter's!

737598,2,6303890423,"As far as a review goes if you want the short version, it's a simple case of a lot of talent wasted on an extremely weak script. The marital problems that the Roberts and Quaid characters are having aren't enough or convincing enough to carry the movie so you get very contrived sub plots to fill in and flesh this turkey out. An example; A scene showing a spat between the Duvall and Rowlands characters, who are married, is so contrived it is almost painful to watch these two great actors soldiering through the mess. The ""spat"" has nothing to do with anything else in the movie that I could ascertain. It is just there to fill up some time, I guess. There is absolutely no chemistry between anyone in the movie least of all Roberts and Quaid. Again, lots of talent, very weak script.",1450051200,,787,4.43448275862069

So weak, that the word ""stupid"" comes to mind.  The acting was ok, but good acting cannot make up for a pointless plot.  I wasted my time and money.

I think she relates to a lot of moms out there who are so busy in their own minds who forget their kids and do crazy things. Also, the family dynamics made this movie hilarious. Being from a wealthy family married to another wealthy family makes it interesting. I like that they didn't excuse Eddie's behavior and the family came back to being loyal to each other and sticking up for themselves.",1397606400,,493,4.550561797752809

738709,5,6303890423,"Didn't realize I'd never reviewed one of my favorite ""chick"" flicks.  Gena Rowlands can't help, but turn a movie into one you want to watch over & over.  See her in ""Gloria"" - a ex-gangster's moll.  Naturally Julia reminded us why she's a big star.  Ah, (can I faint now?) Dennis is so sexy + cute as a button.  He's just as good in ""The Big Easy"" - no, he's sexier.  Kyra - the perfect sister - what she does to Eddie is so warranted.  Ladies, haven't you always wanted to do that to some ""lying sack of s***"" in your life?  Robert is so good I pretty much hated him.  See him in ""Tender Mercies"" & have a tissue handy.

Caroline - you just wanted to hug her.

Quaid has apparently given ""marriage counseling"" to a number of his wife's friends, and, even though she is devastated, Julia's misogynistic father, played by Robert Duvall as the reincarnation of Napoleon, tells her to suck it up and get over it.  How Julia handles her friends, the former debutantes, at a meeting of the ""Charity League"" is hilarious. Kyra Sedgwick, as Julia's sister, is pitch perfect in dealing with both their father and Julia's husband.",1380499200,,683,5.089285714285714

The story itself was well done and the outcome was different but nice cause you expect the norm when it comes to the endings.  Julie Roberts is terrific in it, as usual.  Dennis Quaid plays a different part than his normal nice guy routine, but he's a very good actor, I think.  He's one of my favorites.  It's cute, funny and dramatic in many areas.  I think you'll like it.  It's not a mainstream, popular movie, but I'm surprised it didn't hit bigger.",1380153600,,523,4.375

Julia Roberts was great in her character role  as a wife who husband had cheated on her, with a family she had to consider her options when she found out about it. Loving horses the way I always did and still do this movie drew me in and I really enjoyed the entire movie will watch it again and I  loved the dancing and music as well.

The script was well-written with dialog that moved the story along, the actors all performed well and within the realm of reality, and the latter reflects good direction.

738950,4,6303890423,What's not to like.  It's Julia Roberts for goodness sake.  She never seems to disappoint me.  It's a funny story about a woman who finds out her husband is cheating on her and let's everyone in her circle of so called friends know she knows all about their affairs and those of their husbands and does it quite publically.  Dennis Quaid as her husband does a good job in the role of the unfaithful  husband and shows his comedy side well.  Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands as her parents have issues of their own but both believe Grace ( Julia) should stay with her husband.  Kyra Sedgwick plays Grace's sister and does so with gusto. I have sister's but would like to add her to my family.  That would be fun.  I recommed it.,1366243200,,726,4.358208955223881

There is no excuse for putting an abridged version of the film in 1:13:1 and the original aspect ratio of 1:85:1 version on the film on different sides of a single disc. Put them on the same side.

This movie was funny, creative and all around a great one for any movie collection.",1355702400,,273,4.591836734693878
739087,5,6303890423,"Let me first start by saying I haven't seen all of Julia Roberts movies; but on advice I watched this one on a movie channel several years ago and found it extremely believable. I personally know people like those depicted in this feature, especially the character of Aunt Rea played beautifully by Anne Shropshire (The Green Card, Tootsie, The First Wives Club and As the World Turns).

Adultery and the poisoning of one's philandering husband, isn't comical; but both take place within the span of the movie, and the characters are so understandably human one has to give them a pass.

There are several story lines, first Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid, Rowlands and Duvall, owners of a prominent riding stable, and Duvall and Muse Watson, trainer of a Jumper, something for everyone.

Kyra Sedgwick is the sister every woman would love to have; Brett Cullen (Houston native and childhood friend of Dennis Quaid) serves as the respectable, almost lover of Julia's as he refuses to take advantage of her apparent inebriation. Gena Rowlands and Robert Duvall bring just as much cunning and hilarity as do Roberts and Quaid.

In my opinion one of the best and most truthful scenes takes place @ the party following the competition held @ their horse farm; Julia and Dennis dance to ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)"" and you see the ice beginning to thaw between them which sets the scene for the healing of their relationship.

Not one of her more prominent movies; but I think one of her best, I highly recommend it.

A Post Script: There is profanity; and a few key scenes may prove too mature for some younger audiences. I would suggest anyone purchasing this that has young children to watch it first, before the family sits down for movie night, but in all honesty I wouldn't categorize this as family friendly.",1355529600,3,1828,4.768987341772152

739293,1,6303890423,"If you love this movie or think the pairing of Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid (I really do like both of them) sounds like a great movie, you should stop reading right now..

okay, you were warned.

The movie appears to be set in the 1990's but the way the characters act, you'd think it was maybe the late 50s or early 60s.  But the language is definitely 1990s language (and foul). One example of the weird era is a meeting the main character attends, where the women are arguing whether to have their name listed as (for example) Mrs Schmoe Herschovitz as opposed to Juanita Herschovitz in a cookbook. One woman argues people wouldn't know who she was if her first name was listed as the recope writer. All I could think of was ""What? in the 1990s?"" And spare me the ""Southern Belle"" bit - I know some ""Southern Belles"" and truly, ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned""...
Julia Roberts plays Grace an emotionally cold woman who stews over her dream of being a large animal vet going sour after becoming pregnant and getting married. It's not quite clear who stopped her from finisheing vet school, perhaps pregnant women weren't allowed in college at that time. Didn't they have birth control at that time? She marries Dennis Quaid, whose college nickname was ""Hound Dog"" apparently because he likes the ladies.
Because Grace doesn't finish her last year at vet school, she is forced to work at her father's horse ranch, which he runs as a dictatorship. Somewhere along the way, Grace sees her husband kissing another woman in public.  She also catches him at a bar with the woman as well as his friends. She leaves & goes back to her parents.
Her father advises her to make nice because apparently in that era, whenever it was, men were expected to fool around on their wives and wives were supposed to accept it.  He has a buisness deal with the son-in-law's family and he wants everything to go smoothly.
Grace stirs up a tiny bit of trouble, based on what she finds out from her ""friends"" (that have had sex with Grace's husband) and following the advice of the ""crazy aunt"". But there's no real payoff. Of course, it's Grace's fault that hubby cheated - she was cold and distant. Why she is distant is never discussed. And besides, hubby states it really wasn't that much fun to fool around on his wife.  _right_ I guess he just forced himself to do it because - well, that's never answered, either.
There's more stuff that goes on, but I kept wondering why. Of course, one amazing dance on the dance makes them fall back in love with each other again. Grace goes back to finish vet school. Hubby stops messing around on her.  Everything is hunky dory....
Besides the lack of sympathetic characters, the huge lips on the stars seem to get in the way of the acting. All my husband could do is notice the lips. All I could think of what a waste of time this movie was. I wanted to smack almost everybody and tell them to grow up.
So as you can tell, I'm going to end this review with a ""do not watch"" recommendation. I don't normally say that but this movie stunk.",1217289600,7,3072,4.46524064171123

739427,4,6303890423,"Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse Hallstrm - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema.

The story is rather slight: Grace (Julia Roberts) is a Southern Belle horse trainer married to handsome but womanizing Eddie (Dennis Quaid) who discovers to her amazement that Eddie is dating other women.  This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives!  Grace's sister Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick, in yet another of her sensational roles) is a perky, spitfire of a woman who seems to be the only member who has her act together; her mother Georgia (Gena Rowlands) and father Wyly (Robert Duvall) are both able to reveal the old South and the new individuality they achieve; Brett Cullen, Haley Aull, and  Muse Watson are all excellent in their roles.

One of the most entertaining aspects of this entertaining film is the confrontation between 'old manners' and new reality - with some heady lessons for all of us to observe and allow chuckles.  It is a tight little film that deserves another visit on DVD.  Grady Harp, August 06",1155945600,2,1755,4.83

Julia Robers, Kyra Sedgwick (in a Golden Globe nominated performance), Robert Duvall, Gena Rowlands, and Dennis Quaid are terrific. It doesn't go for the happily-ever after ending. It is balances the comedy and the drama rather well... Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise) should be prouder of this film then that Ya-Ya Sisterhood crap. Great dialogue!

I put them on, if for nothing else, for the background noise.  This movie is one of them.  The title of the movie says it all; Julia Roberts (Grace) gives the entire town something to talk about when she finds out about her husband's cheating ways.  The movie is funny and poignant at the same time, making the viewer re-visit some decisions they made in their lives that got them where they are today. Kyra Sedgwick is absolutely fabulous (much better than in ""Singles"") and Gena Rowlands is wonderful, as well.  Pair that with a great subplot about horse competitions and coming to grip with aging, you've got a great movie that was completely underrated by most critics.",1075248000,47,808,4.583333333333333

Julia Roberts does a believable job as a woman who has found out that her husband has screwed around on her. What I liked most about this movie was allll of the secondary characters... Kyra was the PERFECT Older sister looking out for her younger one, Gena was Great as the Southern Belle Mama, the Aunt (don't know this woman's name)was HILARIOUS as the ""little"" crazy Aunt that would/could go there. You really have to pay attention to this movie there are so many innuendos and funny moments that I truly can recommend this one. The actress that played the daughter was wonderful and last but not least Dennis Quaid did quite a convincing job as a contrite husband (once he was caught).
If you want something along this plot line I would also suggest ""Hope Floats"" which also stars Gena Rowlands and has pretty much the same subject matter but not the same movie. Enjoy.

739461,3,6303890423,"It moves along, but it's a little light, a little bland.  I suggest skipping it unless you really love Julia Roberts, horses or marriages that almost fail but don't.  It's not worth seeing for Quaid or Duval.  The younger Robert Duval is my favorite male actor (To Kill A Mocking Bird, The Great Santini, Apocalypse Now), but nowadays he seems to have lost his dramatic power.  (And  Dennis Quaid's hair seems to be auditioning for a role as a winter quilt.)
Robert Duval plays the owner of a ranch operation somewhere in the south, where he raises and trains show horses.  Julia Roberts plays his daughter.  She works for dad, managing the stables.  Dennis Quaid plays her husband.  Julia discovers that her husband has been cheating on her.  In the course of being furious and ashamed, she discovers that he has slept with a number of women in town, all of whom she knows.
At the office, Julia discusses her problems over the phone with a friend but uses a speakerphone and is overheard.  He husband has a consultation over lunch at a restaurant, with the meanest divorce lawyer in town.  The whole town is talking.  Dennis Quaid apologizes to Julia, very insincerely.  Julia's friends convince her to put up with it, forgive and take him back.  Spontaneously, in the end, without any catharsis or precipitation, husband and wife dance together to the song, ""Let's Give Them Something To Talk About.""  This is what passes fro reconciliation.  Presumably everyone lives happily ever after.  It was all just too easy.",1026604800,3,1517,4.7915057915057915

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the racial sterotype of the maid in the movie.  They could have left that character out, especially since the woman NEVER utters a word.  Robert Duvall is classic!  He nearly steals the show from Julia and Dennis who also give stellar performances.

739463,3,6303890423,"I enjoyed the movie, because it was very entertaining.  I also found it interesting because the issues that were addressed are so real for so many women.  So many of us make bad decisions due to family interference and pressure.  Even without interference, we cannot predict how a marriage is going to sour in the future. Julia Roberts' character has nothing to be embarassed about.  Her husband is the one who should be embarassed.  The ""friends"" who covered up the affair should also be embarassed. Besides, a woman does not need to catch her husband red handed to know that an affair is going on. She may know even before the husband does.",1005264000,,642,4.646017699115045
739464,3,6303890423,"A real disappointment. Great cast (Julia Roberts, Dennis Quaid,Robert DuVall, Gena Rowlands, Kyra Sedgwick and a number of talented character actors); accomplished director (Lasse Hallstrom of ""Cider House Rules,"" ""Chocolat,"" and ""My Life as a Dog"" fame); noted screenwriter (Callie Khouri, who also penned ""Themlma and Louise"")--all of which makes you wonder, ""What the heck went wrong!""
 It must have looked good on paper, but this quasi-feminist tale of a woman, who catches her husband straying and then proceeds to make a public spectacle of herself (more than once)is just clumsy and ultimately unsatisfying. All the silliness is supposed to just be the stones in the path of Julia's personal growth. But really, after the debacle at the Ladies' Club, anyone but Julia Roberts would have been forced to leave town. If it were funny, that's be one thing, but it's really just awkward. A damn shame, considering all the talent involved.
 If there were no such things as rentals, admirers of Julia Roberts or the rest of the cast--or of director Hallstrom--might have to actually buy this one, but while it may be worth a look-see, it's only a must buy for the most die-hard of fans.",999388800,2,1186,4.984848484848484
739465,3,6303890423,"Director Lasse Hallstrom attempts to combine two venerable Hollywood genres and several subplots in this nonetheless agreeable morality tale about the bad effect adultery can have on your marriage.  Part women's POV romantic comedy and part Dixie family dynamics saga, this is a generational story about what it takes to make a marriage work.  It's a little scattered and loose fitting and underdeveloped in parts, but there's enough warmth and bright comedy to make up for the defects, and the cast is fun to watch.

The script by Callie Khouri is familiar but clever with some good human observations and some nice twists.  I notice that Khouri also wrote Thelma and Louise (1991), which may explain why, in this flick, it is the men who learn (and need) most of the hard lessons.  Robert Duvall plays the still feisty patriarch, Wlyly King, who really needs to learn to loosen the reigns a little, while Dennis Quaid, who plays Grace's adulterous husband, needs to appreciate what he's got and to stop catting around.  Kyra Sedgwick as Grace's sister helps him by kneeing him right where it hurts the most, and Grace, accidentally on purpose, nearly poisons him.  (All part of his well-deserved and to be continued penance.)  Sedgwick sparkles while being careful not to upstage ""America's Darling"" too often while Gena Rowlands as the mother is steady and sure.

Julia Roberts has become a great star and a great actress, and she is one of my favorites, but there is no question that she felt not entirely comfortable in this part.  From the details of the script you can see that she is supposed to be a somewhat ditzy and naively outspoken woman, a southern belle with spunk, a mind of her own, and a desire to be something more than her father's daughter or her husband's wife.  Julia got most of it right except for the ditzy part.  She either wouldn't bend (maybe her agency advised against looking too weird) or Hallstrom didn't insist because Julia played this like Bogart always played Bogart, just like herself.  You can see that the character of Grace Bichon is a bit out in left field because she leaves her daughter places or forgets to take her as she drives off in the morning.  And then there was that outrageous confrontation at the woman's club where she stands up and demands to know how many other women have been sleeping with her husband.  Something to talk about indeed!

But Julia stays Julia, and so the character is never developed as written.  Nonetheless Julia Roberts is always wonderful, and although there is not here the effortless and nearly flawless style she was then developing, a style that culminated in her Oscar winning performance in Erin Brockovich, there is the undeniable down to earth charm and warmth that has made her so beloved by audiences that she can command something like twenty million dollars per.

Robert Duvall obviously had a lot of fun with his part, but I wonder if he realizes how much he looks like a bantam rooster in those riding tights!
