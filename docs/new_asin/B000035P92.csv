7916541,4,B000035P92,"Two awesome classic episodes from the original power rangers. This power ranger movie is must own for any power ranger fan. Jason was my favorite ranger of all time, these episodes are vintage classics.",1417651200,,202,4.970588235294118
7916542,5,B000035P92,the vhs does not come with the mighty morphin one it comes with time force but my son loves it,1405209600,,94,3.75
7916543,3,B000035P92,"I gave this a low rating because for a ""Red Ranger Adventure"" tape, there were episodes that showed what Jason was made of  a lot better. The first is Day of the Dumpster, the series premiere, which highlights no one as it introduces us to *everyone,* and the second, The Wanna-Be Ranger, is also a good one, but again, Jason doesn't do more than any of the others. There are no shortage of episodes with good character development for Jason... and neither of them are used here. Also, only two episodes is a bit disappointing. There are other PR tapes with four or five.

Nothing against either of the episodes on this tape, though.",1253923200,,633,4.543859649122807
7916544,5,B000035P92,"I read some of the other reviews here where it sounds like mostly adults giving their opinions about whether or not they like the power rangers.  To me if they are watching these as adults, they probably need a little therapy.  These tapes are for kids and so my review is based on what my kids think.  They love the Power Rangers and we have bought several tapes.  I am writing my review on this tape in particular since this seems to be one of their favorites.  The Red Ranger is their favorite and the episodes that feature the Red Ranger seem to get played the most.  Hope this helps a parent trying to pick one.",1203724800,,616,4.267241379310345
7916545,5,B000035P92,"When watching a show like ""Power Rangers,"" you have to look at things outside your own worldview.  You have to be willing to experience a story that's unique among others.  And this video is the perfect way to do it.
Featuring the pilot episode of ""Day of the Dumpster,"" this ""Power Playback"" edition shows how something unique and different can cause a worldwide phenomenon and can start a chain reaction of relentless success until this very day, 10 years after ""Day of the Dumpster"" premiered.
In short, this video is a must-have if you're not a mindless drone to society's bias standard of ""what's good.""",1053129600,8,608,4.780952380952381
7916546,5,B000035P92,"This video is awesome for those who enjoy watching Power Rangers, and especially, for those who loved the original series of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  This video has the original Red Ranger, Jason, as played by Austin St. John.  He was the best Power Ranger of all because he was tough, a good fighter, and his overacting fit the series and his character perfectly. Watching a show like this just isn't fun when you have bland actors who just barely audibly speak their lines, and with the original series you get to see the best Red Ranger, and to me, the best Power Ranger (besides all of the pretty girl Power Rangers).  So if you're looking for a cheesy, fun, fantastic good time, this is the tape to get.",975715200,11,714,4.51937984496124
7916547,5,B000035P92,"By purchasing this video, you get to see how the Power Ranger Phenominon all started with it's first episode ""Day of the Dumpster"".  This video is actually a compilation of two eps: the one listed before and  ""The Wanna Be Ranger"".  This video shows off clasic examples of  why Power Rangers is still one of the greatest shows still on TV.  If you  want more action and excitement, I recomend purchasing both Power Rangers  Lost Galaxy tapes here at this site!",947635200,11,460,4.604938271604938
