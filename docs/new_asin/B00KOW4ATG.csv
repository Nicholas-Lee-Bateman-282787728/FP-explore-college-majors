6437428,3,B00KOW4ATG,"We're big fans of British TV in this household. We would much rather watch British than American productions of anything. This was OK, nothing great. I also took offense, or rather questioned, why the lead actress was called ""fatty"" all through the series. I wonder if everyone in Scotland is so rude? They weren't pleasant to each other for the most part. This is entertaining but not up to most of the other series we've seen. This is another one that wasn't renewed so don't get too attached.. they aren't coming back for another episode.",1412380800,11,541,4.705263157894737
6437429,5,B00KOW4ATG,"FIELD OF BLOOD, SERIES 1.  This is a 1980s Glasgow-set BBC Scotland television series based on the popular works of award-winning Glasgow-based crime writer Denise Mina.  Both seasons of the production come to us here.  The British mystery/crime drama centers on Paddy Meehan, an unusual protagonist for a mystery: shes a feisty young local reporter whos taking her lumps, looking for her big break in the sexist, hard-drinking, cutthroat world of journalism. The production, thank goodness, and RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, has subtitles: how else could those on my side of the pond make sense of the Glaswegian burr?  The boxed set comes as two DVDs, running 240 minutes plus bonus programming.  For mature audiences. I received this as a review copy.

Season 1, Disc 1
EPISODE ONE
Its 1982 Glasgow, and, of course, everyone drinks and smokes heavily.  Paddy is a copy boy: thats what shes called in the macho world of newspaper journalism, despite the minor fact that shes a girl.  And everyone calls her fat, even herself, because thats how she was characterized in the underlying book, despite the fact that the actress playing her is not fat.  Anyway, Paddy has a friend/enemy in Heather, girl reporter, the only other female at the paper.  And a family connection in the breaking case of a missing two-year-old. As the story develops, Paddy believes it could give her a much-desired opportunity to advance to reporter, but her close-knit Irish Catholic family has closed ranks against the paperand her.
EPISODE TWO
Paddy continues to investigate even after the case has taken a dangerous turn. She is convinced of the innocence of her accused cousin, but she is getting little support from her colleagues, her family, or her fianc.  She uncovers a link to a past child murder.

Season 2, Disc 2, THE DEAD HOUR, based on Minas crime drama of the same name.
EPISODE ONE
Its 1984 in Glasgow, everyone still smokes and drinks heavily; Paddy has been promoted to junior reporter.  She and McVie, riding in the call car, follow the cops to a domestic disturbance, which seems to be nothing much.  But when the brutally-murdered body of Vhari Burnett, the beautiful young lawyer involved the disturbance, shows up a short time later, Paddy realizes shes made a mistake, and starts her own investigation, paralleling and intersecting with the cop shops.  She is blocked in this by the terrifying new female editor in chief installed by the holding company that has just bought The Glasgow Daily News, Paddys paper.

EPISODE TWO. As what is possibly the last major miners strike drags on, Paddys out-of-work miner father considers returning as a scab, while her sister Mary Ann decides to become a nun, denying the family her earning power. Meanwhile, Vharis sister Karen Burnett sends Paddy sensitive information, which several parties are determined to keep from publication.

The acting is fine.  Paddy is played by Jayd Johnson, (DEAR FRANKIE), who won a BAFTA for this role; Murray Devlin, Paddys accustomed editor, by David Morrisey,(THE WALKING DEAD); Trisha Meehan, Paddys mother, by Bronagh Gallagher, (THE COMMITMENTS), and my, how the girls in that backup singing group do still get around.  David Hayman plays Red Willie McDade, National Union of Miners (NUM) official. Peter Capaldi, (DR. WHO), plays Dr. Pete, and gives a riveting performance in the role.  The photography is evocative, and captures Glasgow in its darkest moods.  I learned to love that muscular city, watching TAGGART, so much so that I once spent a week there.  Only thing that could have pleased me more about this entertainment would have been Mark McManus, the original Taggart, wending his way through the city on the Clyde.  Unfortunately he died relatively young, while still working on that series, a great tartan noir police procedural.

Denise Mina, who was born in Glasgow and is still resident there, was once a favorite of mine, and I have read, and reviewed, FIELD OF BLOOD and THE DEAD HOUR on their respective pages. She was certainly one of the earliest, strongest exemplars of tartan noir.  And what is tartan noir, you might well ask.  A grim and dour mystery, heavy on the blood, the violence, and the bloody-mindedness, lightened somewhat by that dark Scottish humor. And might this series be described as tartan noir?  Maybe.  Its got its share of blood and graveyard humor. Anyway, we greatly enjoyed this series in this house, and went looking for more.",1411862400,3,4453,4.997289972899729
6437430,3,B00KOW4ATG,"This is the first of two seasons revolving around a young aspiring Scottish journalist trying to make her way in 1980s Glasgow, hindered by a less than perfect family situation and male colleagues who are afflicted with varying degrees of chauvinism. David Morissey and Peter Capaldi are part of a nice ensemble cast. Indeed, the supporting characters are perhaps the best thing about this story. The central plot is grim and compelling, though many of the characters' actions in pursuit of a solution would today be questionable or illegal. Jayd Johnson is excellent as Paddy Meehan, the young would-be journalist, though like at least one other reviewer, I was put off by other characters describing Meehan as a ""fat lassie"" when the actress is decidedly not plump. In the end, I found the story stalling at times, but the character portrayals more than made up for it. If I could, I'd give this 3.5 stars: more than just okay, but not quite superior.",1411344000,4,953,4.852760736196319
6437431,5,B00KOW4ATG,"I liked it more than expected. My wife too. Setting Scotland, another unusual bit from the prolific UK crime drama offerings. The newspaper office, and the search for news truth, is a unique way of presenting crime. This is 2 adapted books of the author, Denise Mina. Both stories are 2 hours long, each divided into 2 episodes, but don't expect to watch the first without immediately viewing the ending. It's gripping, it's electric, it's 1980s period perfect, it's well acted, and it's gritty with less blood than some. Strong scenes (thriller mode) and language places this unrated series into the teen-&-up field.

Regular cast (all 4 episodes) includes the Meehan family: dad Con (Matt Costello), mom Trisha (Bronagh Gallagher who deserves an award), & daughters Mary Ann (Kelsey Griffin) & Paddy (Jayd Johnson: who is the lead, a young newsroom girl, and who did win a BAFTA for this role.) Another reporter McVie (Ford Kiernan: also BAFTA nominated); news editor Devlin (David Morrissey); and Richards (Brian Pettifer -`Bleak House' `Hamish Macbeth' and a real-life native of Glasgow) round out the repeat news staff.

SDH SUBTITLES in English provided. Occasionally appreciated due to Scottish and Irish accents. Mysteries are named after the book titles.
THE FIELD OF BLOOD:
1982 Glasgow's Paddy, lowest on the newsroom employee scale, has a personal tie to a missing child story. This story advances her newsroom career but bringing scorn from her family. Shunned and not believed, she presses on to prove the child held as prime suspect is innocent. But with no help from colleagues or cops, the investigation gets dangerous. Murder perilous. Peter Capaldi gets his own BAFTA nomination for his drinking reporter role.
THE DEAD HOUR:
1984 Glasgow and Paddy gets a promotion to Jr. Reporter. Body remains following a previous murder gets Paddy digging deep for her story, even though she and McVie both accepted a bribe not to write about it. A new editor-in-chief arrives (Katherine Kelly -`Mr Selfridge'). She wants dirt to publish against the striking miners. Events begin to link together thus putting more than one reporter in harm's way. Crime and Cop bosses may get toes stepped on when the news office takes on corruption via headlines. But who will suffer from taking that high a risk?

2 feature-length stories, both better drama than anything I've watched in the cinema over the past 12 months.",1409184000,13,2415,5.062814070351759

6437433,3,B00KOW4ATG,"Field of Blood is a Glasgow, Scotland set child killer mystery told through the angle of a coffee boy (yes they call a female this) at a local newspaper.  This is set in the very early 80's when towns and cities still had multiple papers, which the majority of the population read depending on what was the lead story on the front.  Being set back then there's a lot of smoking, and the treatment of the main character Paddy and her only other female colleague Heather, by the other staff would get them straight into court on harassment or discrimination charges today.  But you could get away with it then and that's the setting needed to tell this story.  Basically the plot revolves around a boy going missing whose corpse is found later having been beaten.  Another young eight year old boy is charged with his murder but the police aren't revealing his identity.  Unfortunately for him, he's a cousin of Paddy who recognises him at the police station.  Paddy of course doesn't want to name him even though doing so would result in a big payday for the paper and launch her career as a reporter.  She confides in a colleague who of course runs with the story. Her family doesn't believe her and ostracises her. Paddy however is convinced her cousin didn't do it and looks into the past to prove who did.

Field of Blood is a decent enough viewing, but not one you're ever likely to watch a second time round.  For some reason Paddy is constantly referred to as being fat by herself, colleagues and family. She eats nothing but boiled eggs the whole film, determined to shed weight  The actress playing her (Jayd Johnson) clearly isn't overweight at all, in fact in a movie that UK style uses average looking people making them more realistic than Hollywood style norm of everyone being attractive, Paddy would by far be the best looking person in the movie.  So my question would be if you're going to use an actress who isn't fat, why constantly call her fat by everyone?  It adds nothing to the plot and other than perhaps creating eating disorders for those not quite as in shape as the actress, it achieves nothing.  The film is based on a book by Denise Mina, so perhaps the character in the book is fat and being so is more a part of the plot, but if it was important to have fat references why not use a larger actress or have Johnson, Zellweger style for Bridget Jones, put on the weight before filming, or at the very least wear a fat suit and makeup.  But the fat references added nothing to the film's plot so really should have been left out completely.  The character was a good one as a strong determined woman, trying to do the right thing against adversity in both the workplace and at home.  Johnson does do a great job as an actress in the role too.",1405123200,5,2772,4.457425742574258

6437442,5,B00KOW4ATG,"This independently produced crime series which aired on BBC Scotland in 2011 and 2013 is based on two books by writer Denise Mina. The DVD contains two adapted novels and each is broken into two one hour plus on minute ""episodes"".  (There is a ""next on"" and a ""previously on"" section as it was aired at different times.

The first story - the one the DVD is titled after - introduces us to Paddy - a young girl who wants to be a news reporter in Glasgow but it stuck as a ""gofer"" running errands in the Newsroom. She gets her break here but it also affects her family at home. (That's all I'm going to reveal; it's best to discover more for yourself). Paddy is the focus of the series and the actress who plays her is great. I preferred the first story - maybe it was because it introduced me to Paddy, but though the second story was a bit more complicated - she still kept me interested.

If you REALLY want more details on the plots I'll let you read the other reviews but I urge you not to know too much.

I will comment that the series takes place in the 1980s - in the pre-cellphone days when folks used ""pagers"" and still used typewriters. Computers are just arriving in the newsroom as the second story takes place.

The accents are sometimes a little thick for me so I used the English subtitles that RLJ added. They are in easy to read bright yellow. Another advantage is that when pop vocal recordings appear, not only are the lyrics there but they identify the singer! (nice touch RLJ!).

The first story stands completely on its own with no loose ends. The second one has a few ""cliffhangers"" about some of the recurring characters, but the case is wrapped up. This is Set  1 of what will be a continuing series from RLJ.

The DVD contains no ""bonus features""

It's a different way to solve crimes - and also learn how the independent press works . I can recommend it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6437443,3,B00KOW4ATG,"Set in Glasgow in 1982 and based on books by Denise Mina, Field of Blood follows the efforts of newspaper copy ""boy"" Patricia (Paddy) Meehan to work her way into the hard drinking, cynical, sexist newspaper world.  Series 1 consists of two 2-part episodes on two disks.

In the first episode, a young child is abducted in broad daylight from a public park and later found murdered. The police arrest an older boy for the crime who turns out to be a member of Paddy's extended family.  Though the case looks open and shut, only Paddy notices the strong resemblance of the dead child to an eerily similar kidnap/murder years earlier.  As she doggedly chases down the real story, she contends with colleagues who see her as an upstart, an indifferent police department convinced the culprit is in custody, and the anger of her own family who believe she is betraying them to make a name for herself.

In the second episode, Paddy unravels the mystery of a murdered lawyer, the disappearance of the lawyer's sister and the suicide of her husband against the backdrop of the bitter struggle between the miners' unions and a Thatcher Government determined to crush them and willing to use its own security services to run a vicious disinformation campaign against union leaders.  At the same time, the paper's been bought up by a Rupert Murdoch-like conglomerate that cares only about circulation numbers and is pushing the paper's editorial policy firmly to the right, bringing in a devious, cynical, and completely manipulative woman editor-in-chief to do the dirty work.

Series 1 does a great job of recreating the bad old 1980s where men were drunks and chain smokers and women weren't welcome in the workforce.  The look and feel of Scotland's ""other city"" is just right.  The cast is strong indeed, featuring Jayd Johnson as Paddy, the always-excellent David Morrisey as her boss, and a superb Ford Kiernan as the rumpled and heavy drinking crime reporter who becomes Paddy's ally and mentor.

Don't be misled by the prominent placement of veteran Scottish actor Peter Capaldi (now Dr. Who) on the DVD cover.  He's only a bit player here, given one minor scene to recite Dylan Thomas's brilliant poem ""And Death Shall Have No Dominion.""  The under use of Capaldi (not to mention the fact that Dylan Thomas was Welsh, not Scottish) illustrates the basic problem with Field of Blood: at two episodes per story line, the show is just not long enough to take full advantage of the strong cast, potentially interesting story lines, and strong location.  As a consequence, it's undone by scripts that have to rush along to get things done in the allotted time.  Characters become caricatures, particularly the paper's new editor in chief, played by Katherine Kelly as the reincarnation of Cruella DeVille.  In one episode, Paddy plants physical evidence on a suspected killer; in the other she rushes in and overpowers one of the most vicious drug kingpins in Glasgow.  Suuuure that's gonna happen.  And both she and her boss make cringe-worthy personal decisions completely out of keeping with their supposed integrity and intelligence.

For the most part, the acting's very good, but the time limits and hard-to-believe scripts make what could have been a great series merely watchable.  It's too bad:  I really wanted to like it more than I did.",1415664000,3,3343,4.914590747330961
8660506,2,B00KOW4ATG,"What year was this show made?  I liked the young female lead but shocked to see women treated so poorly. I felt sorry for her, which depressed me a bit. The mysteries themselves are dark.",1518652800,,187,4.3428571428571425
8660507,2,B00KOW4ATG,"Another series with a brilliant but misunderstood female surrounded by weak and jerky males.  Her career comes first, of course.  Her religious family is catatonic and horrible.  Of course.  Same old same old.

She's dieting on eggs all the way through even though this is the 80s and the height of the low fat nonsense.

Please, please, please stop telling the same stories with the same characters over and over and over.

Second story:  newspaper taken over by mean lady who wants it to lean more right than left.  This is the exact opposite of what actually happened with Glasgow newspapers in the 80s:

""Glasgow's newspapers have ceased to be Glasgow owned, the controlling companies being either English or American. There have been noteworthy political changes too: most remarkably, the Herald, a highly reliable supporter of the Conservative cause until the 1980s, became an independent left of centre title by the nineties.""

Episode 1--3 stars
Episode 2--5 stars

RE: Episode 1--A well-plotted story with excellent acting from a female lead was weakened by insane commentary throughout the show about the appearance of said actress known as Paddy, who simply has a round face.  She is NOT fat!  Consequently, it was ludicrous to watch this attractive woman being told that she was fat by just about every man she ran into. It was also painful to see her feel this pressure to the extent that she was on this horrible diet. Additionally, the comparison of her to her female colleague was something out of the Twilight Zone: ""One is pretty--the other not so much."" Really?????  Please--that was hard to swallow.  Sure, one was made up more than the other and wore tighter outfits, but that was about it; they were both young attractive women.  It seems to me that the standards of female beauty have become so high that no woman can meet them nowadays w/out artificial enhancements. Is the average man even attracted to the average woman anymore? You wouldn't think so by watching this show.  Equally disturbing was the chronic belittling of her youth. She acted very mature, so who cares if she was young anyway? What was with all the age discrimination?  And there was no way anyone hearing her voice over the phone would think she was too young to speak to on a professional level.  She didn't sound like a teenager; she sounded like a grown woman.

RE: Episode 2--Thankfully, all of the nonsense in the first episode is eliminated in the second. We are left with an engaging and exciting story, filled with rich characterization and interesting plot twists. Please don't go the the kitchen for a snack until you have watched the final few minutes of this show, in which actress Bronagh Gallagher performs some of the best acting you will ever see!!",1450915200,,1841,4.739811912225705
