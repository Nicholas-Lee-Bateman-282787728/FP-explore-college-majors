Her teaching style is informal but rich in content, great sense of humor, never takes herself too seriously, and super-encouraging for any student regardless of past experience.  Do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection.",1370736000,,308,5.019607843137255
7802213,5,1596683945,"I have taken a workshop with Beryl in Colorado, purchased her book and HAD to have her DVD.  I love her mixed media style and her ways of taking what other people might consider items destined for the trash bin or hardware store items and making them over into beautiful embellishments. In my opinion, Beryl rules!",1326240000,,314,4.607142857142857
