5103459,5,B007PSY30S,"I did not see this movie and therefore have to right to rate the video, but I want to add this comment. So I gave the video five stars so that no one could object to my review on the basis that someone who had not seen the movie had lowered the rating.

I was amused when I saw video of the Hollywood directors in court objecting to Cleanflix on the basis that Cleanflix violated the directors' artistic vision. If this were the true motive of their opposition, they why don't they object when TV broadcasters not only delete profanity, nudity, and violence but also insert 40 minutes of commercials into their movies? Doesn't that violate their artistic vision more egregiously than Cleanflix? The reason is because Hollywood earns huge profits from the commercial TV broadcasts. Hollywood gained little profit from Cleanflix, but suddenly the directors rise up in artistic rage against Cleanflix because it edited their movies. Deleting profanity, nudity, and violence does not violate their artistic vision when royalty-paying TV broadcasters do it, but it does violate their artistic vision when Cleanflix does it? Just admit it. Their indignation is more about money and less about artistic vision.",1343692800,12,1203,5.015

5103461,5,B007PSY30S,"It was fascinating to get a behind the scenes look at the industry that stirred up so many headlines.  As someone who used Cleanflicks (until I realized a lot of the movies simply don't hold up under the editing process) it was really interesting seeing how everything played out.  I still think if someone owns a film, it's their right to do whatever they want to it (just like owning any other piece of art).  But modifying it for general distribution does seem a little sketchy and I can see how the Director's Guild would want to step in and defend their art.  Loved the styling of the documentary as well as the interviews.

CAUTION: The film compares edited to un-edited scenes so you can get an idea of what the editors were removing from the film.  As a result there is some graphic violence and nudity so if you are an old Cleanflicks customer you may find it a little offensive.  If you are comfortable with that, it's a fascinating and well-made documentary!",1333324800,13,969,4.5344827586206895

8520624,4,B007PSY30S,"The best documentary I've seen about Utah's eccentricities, though it concentrates on defining one man as a stand-in for the culture.  This is the Napster copyright debacle replayed as video piracy.

The film splits into three segments or themes:  a) taking a business flyer on riding the fair-use exemption to make and sell as many as ""tens of thousands (THE MATRIX)"" (DVD-R) copies of a recording on blank media, b) court ruling that such copying for resale/rental is copyright infringement and thus piracy, theft, with a brief slowdown renting/selling pirated recordings, followed by both a resurgence of the practice and an impending realization by the storefronts that the business is illegal but the money too good and still desired by its patrons, and c) Danny Thompson's fall as the judas goat for the enterprise.

The film is extremely funny, but told with dry humor.  Ray Lines founds Cleanflicks, but sells off the ""brick and mortar"" stores, several of which go to Danny Thompson, who, the film states, ""corners the market"" in Utah County.  However (shades of MLM?  Suddenly your immediate neighbors are competing with your own product lines, too?), Danny finds himself competing with sprouting stores using his same supplier.

The businesses profiled here remind of those California out-of-the-way used record shops that had racks and racks of private press vinyl live concert albums with blank white covers and crudely photocopied song listings in loose plastic baggies: bootlegs, but in this documentary with a LEAVE IT TO BEAVER/MY THREE SONS twist....

Shots abound of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of what appear to be copied blank DVD-Rs (40-cents each at retail; $20 for a stack 50.  Danny holds up a copied disc, showing the playing side purple colored, plainly a DVD-R.  Add some label stickers and plastic cases available at any office supply...) as business inventory. One particularly amusing episode is the ""inventory selloff"" on the street, listed 3 copies for $20, or $6.66 for a pirate edited copy (!).  In another scene, shelves are stacked with black DVD-R 500 count blanks' cannisters.  The 1:1 original/pirate copy disc ratio gets leveraged as high as 20:1 down the distribution chain....

About the 45 minute mark, the film's plot starts to go under by the bow; the court rules copyright violation and dooms the business, even though the original startup supplied copies on a 1:1 basis with the original factory title.  Businesses shut down for a while, then come back in a state of denial on a Hail Mary theory of ""educational exemption"" from Logan, Utah, but the operators become acutely aware that publicity is their storefronts' worst legal problem.  And here come the reporters....",1418515200,3,2720,5.133786848072562
8520625,5,B007PSY30S,"However, after watching it, all I could think about was getting my hands on an actual Cleanflix Disc of an R Rated movie I know inside and out (like Die Hard or 48 Hrs). I also wondered silly things like, ""Do they have one for Basic Instinct? Probably not, but that would be hilarious!"" A short time after that, I thought about something a little more strange and slightly disturbing.

Music is often sold at certain retailers in a studio approved censored version (to accompany the Parental Advisory/Explicit Lyrics version). Movies aren't. But, (major) movies and music are often both made and/or released by different divisions or subsidiaries of the same parent companies. It's true that there are R Rated Versions and Unrated Versions of the same movies, but that's a little different when you're a Cleanflix Only Customer. Neither version would be acceptable, because a G or PG version is required.

Given that Hollywood already creates a heavily censored version of most big blockbuster movies for television, why would they not want to profit even further? Most of the major film studios already print a portion of their unreleased film catalog for single orders. If there's a movie that's not on DVD, one can purchase it directly from them over the internet. It is sent in the mail in a generic DVD case. This could easily be done with the TV Versions as well, and at $24.99 a pop (which is what the special order DVD costs), they could make off like bandits. Just like they do when they talk about their artistic integrity, then profit from censored music or allow a TV deal to be made on a censored cut of the film. If they truly had integrity there would be no TV cut for their R Rated films - they'd just take the cut in profits. If they truly meant it, they'd stop selling out by censoring anything they produce and stand together to abolish the voluntary ratings in favor of film's First Amendment protection. Hollywood can't turn it's back on Wal-Mart because of money, and Wal-Mart doesn't carry explicit music. Money talks. So the same demands could be made of the movie industry if enough people got behind it and started demanding PG cuts.

There's a flipside though. Blockbuster Video didn't used to carry non-porn NC-17, but before they crashed and burned, they were carrying censored (R Rated) versions of some hardcore XXX Titles (""Pirates"" by Joone for example). Anyone who shopped at Blockbuster supported a retailer that was in business with pornographers, whether they rented one of their censored cuts or not. Those people who purchase censored versions of mainstream films would have to accept the fact that their money would still be going to the same companies that produce the movies they detest, just like Wal-Mart spent-dollars support performers like Eminem since Wal-Mart carries his clean edit. A clean edit, being necessary to facilitate a release deal these days because Wal-Mart and their customer numbers changed the game. To be fair, Cleanflix  proudly announced that each clean cut made required the customer's dollars to purchase an R Cut first, in an attempt to avoid Copyright Violation (from their point of view).

Whether you believe what Cleanflix did should be legal or not, do yourself a favor and watch this flick! The guy who created Cleanflix (not the guy on the cover) seems like a really nice guy who believed in the service he provided and enjoyed the happiness he brought to his customers, who are a totally ignored market. I personally won't watch an R Cut if there's an Uncut, NC-17, or XXX Version and wouldn't spend a dime on a censored album. But for Hollywood companies who sell out every day to ignore a large market over hypocritical artistic integrity claims is plain silly. Almost as silly as a customer who would give their hard earned dollars to a Hollywood company for a censored cut, and ultimately support every so-called evil they stand against.",1394496000,5,3920,4.836065573770492
8520626,2,B007PSY30S,"While I liked the way this movie summarized the history of the clean film industry, the good and the bad, I was appalled by all the cases where they showed both the edited and un-edited versions of the movies, the latter including half a dozen cases of nudity, some terrible violence and foul language.  I quickly learned to cover the screen and pull my earplugs out, but I probably should have just skipped this movie and been content with the wikipedia page.

On the other hand, it was interesting to see the moral dilema presented here of people breaking the law to have access to clean (and therefore more moral) versions of movies, which the directors have chosen to withhold.  It was interesting to hear the directors explain their perspective, even though I disagree.  It appears that they are either too full of themselves to care about their customers or they are overstating their case for legal reasons or to avoid losing money.",1390608000,2,939,4.742331288343558
8520627,2,B007PSY30S,"Reasonably well made but almost completely avoids the real issue. These self-righteous pricks are blatantly copying and selling a copyrighted work.

8520628,2,B007PSY30S,"Cleanflix touches lightly on most of the arguments and points of the parties involved, but eventually it sadly forces its theory connecting Mormon repression with the degeneracy of one man, who incidentally never really had much to do with the subject.  The short amount of time given to the actual CEO and owner of Clean Flicks is articulate.  However from there the film takes a nose dive.

Dan Thompson, seen on the cover photoshopped onto what the world understands is the Mormon garb of white dress shirt and black tie, is an admitted businessman opportunist who bought early into the Clean Flicks video editing chain.  Dan was eventually found to have porn in his video store and convicted of sex with an underage girl.  He is introduced fairly early in the video but sadly is the main occupant of the second half of the film, taking over as the main focus of the entire film.  Sharing the second half of film with Dan is an Associate Professor of Communications lending a sort of scientific credibility to the theory the film puts forth; that Dan's degeneracy is a result of Mormon repression.

The problem is that the data on exposure to violence and sex in media clearly shows bad results(if you don't believe me ask the National Institutes of Health), and if crime or degeneracy statistics is any indication, the people choosing to filter their input are doing much better than those of us who don't.

Dan was no longer a Mormon at the time he was indicted.  In fact, he was sued by Clean Flicks, and wasn't even dealing with Clean Flicks videos when he was convicted.  The film's ""PHD Professor""(actually an associate professor at a Utah university) is Philip Sherman Gordon, a self described liberal Jew who admits ""I do hate the Mormons.  At least sometimes.""['Not a Mormon: Confessions of A Dangerous NoMo'].  Sherman Gordon has injected himself into Utah, using the Salt Lake City Weekly as his soapbox, never halting complaint about Mormon habits, commenting more on Mormon sociology and not his professed expertise - communication.  But I could find NO example of Gordon ever acknowledging the value of filtering media input(as Clean Flicks does)...weird, especially for someone who professes expertise in the field.  He demands people be exposed to the intentions of whoever bought the copyright to the story, which of course is the Hollywood Left, these days in film.  Keep in mind some stories turned into R rated films were originally not R rated at all, and certainly weren't intended by their authors to be selacious.[did i really see Demi Moore's silicone boobs jutting out in The Scarlet Letter? How many teens rent that movie as a supplement to their required reading of that classic?]
Hollywood's track record on coercion associated to the injection of R rated material isn't good.  I specifically remember the incident with the director of the film Desperado, Robert Rodriguez, explaining how the studio said that movie would not be made unless in the film's intro Salma Hayek was nude, simulating sex with her costar Antonio Banderas.  Desperado was the remake of Rodriguez' independent film that got him into the business; to not have that remade would've been traumatizing for him.  Rodriguez directs with his wife, and they both felt forced by the studio to convince Hayek to do that intro scene.  It was traumatic.  Hayek cried before she did the scene because she ""didn't want to be nude"" and concern for her parents(google ""Hayek nude crying Desperado"").  It was clear that any young girls who wanted to emulate her would be forced to watch something they thought she was advocating(indulgent nudity and simulated sex) but few would ever know Hayek(smiling in the scene) was actually being coerced - her career held hostage until she relented.  No one was into that scene, and if you've ever seen the intro it seems out of place.  Now finally the scene is edited out - Hayek coming out afterward expressing her distress during filming wasn't flattering to the studio.  There of course is the famous example of Linda Blair showing up one day to the Exorcist set at the age of 11 without her mother present having William Friedkin surprising her with a changed script, that she would have to say ""F--- me Jesus!"".  She didn't initially want to and only processed the manipulation years later.  John Lassiter, the founder of Pixar, has documented how the company was almost derailed by the aggressive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who as a Disney exec at the time, tried time and time again to derail it's keystone film Toy Story during development by attempting to impose adult themes and ugly adult humor into it.  There are countless unreported cases of this type of Hollywood abuse.  I remember personally an actress who my talent agent got for a topless scene for the film World Gone Wild.  The actress came back to the agent a bit traumatized ""You didn't tell me. They forced me to be nude to do the scene so I just put my head to the side.  I did it for you Fosi.""  Fosi immediately called the producer herself, but her respectful tone meant everyone knew the studio's pursestrings fully controlled the situation.  I actually refocused my creative efforts from acting soon after that.  It's not a clean business...but it could be.  Please, Gordon and the like, not just cult members know what medicine is good for them.

I've read Sherman Gordon's writing on the subject of Clean Flicks, and it restates the bad subargument the film reinforces; that an edited version of a film somehow misrepresents the film maker, since their name is on it.  What is constantly left out is the fact that everything about the reedited film says it is NOT the original, and if money is a concern it is clear that reedited films actually increase studio revenue.  The original remains and is easier to obtain than the edited version.  Considering the court's decision, one has to question whether some sort of monitoring device will be included with every dvd player to make sure the viewer doesn't look away during viewing.  A key point in the actual case is that Clean Flicks was denied a jury trial; it is clear that if there was a jury Clean Flicks would've won.  The people want it.

On a side note, the holy grail of self filtering will be to get the Ala Carte Cable Bill passed.  The impact that Bill will have on how media is produced will be awesome.  Now we can, however, simply drop cable tv and opt for smaller subscription services, but that doesn't replace allowing people to filter major high budget input.",1357344000,10,6532,4.799821268990169
8520629,4,B007PSY30S,"A fascinating case study that raises a lot of interesting questions on all sides. Also relevant for me personally since I was an online CleanFlix customer before they were forced to close.

I found the documentary pretty even-handed. Except, there was a bizarre voice-over near the end about repressed desires always coming out - it's not attributed, so I guess its by the filmmakers themselves. (I personally have never bought into the ""pressure valve"" theory of psychology anyway - why should our brains be like a stream engine or something? Freud was wrong about that, I think.)

The film could also leave the false impression that everyone in Utah Valley is the same, that all of Utah is like Utah Valley, and that all Mormons are conservative Republicans. Not true.

Also, the statements by one of the interviewees were just blatant over-generalization, saying all Mormons are close-minded sheep blindly doing whatever their prophet tells them. Not true either, and absolutely not what the church even itself teaches. The church teaches people to be educated and to think for themselves.

For me one of the questions still unanswered is why Hollywood won't sell airline versions of its movies. There is obviously a significant market for them. I would prefer them myself.

Warning: This movie should be rated a strong R for nudity, adult content, violence, etc. as shown in numerous movie clips.",1357084800,13,1400,5.043290043290043
