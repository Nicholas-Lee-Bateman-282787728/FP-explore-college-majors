2697058,5,B000KRNKNM,"This is a great video, the instructor is upbeat, and has excellent cueing. This is simply a good overall calisthenic workout, I burn a ton of calories, but I don't feel overly exhausted. Cant say enough about this video.",1211155200,,220,4.666666666666667
2697059,4,B000KRNKNM,Cardio Scuplt by Jeanette Jenkins is a good workout. She is very upbeat and the workout will definitely have you sweating! She targets both upper and lower body through fast moving exercises (at times using weights). I definitely recommend this DVD!,1210809600,2,249,5.097560975609756
2697060,5,B000KRNKNM,"Jeanette has a positive, no-nonsense approach to her workout.  If you want a break for water, you've got to pause the DVD (and that's NOT a complaint!!).  She uses every second of that 45 minutes to work your body, head-to-toe.  If you don't want to feel some burn everywhere, try a different workout.  She cuts out any ""fluff"" whatsoever and just keeps to business.  At some points, I thought she came across a little-less-than-friendly and considered marking down one star for that.  But then I remembered:  She's made this workout to be challenging and to actually change the shape of your body.  If you follow along with her routine, there's no way to avoid getting in better shape!!  I purchased this on Amazon for less than $10.00 (shipping was free), and I felt as though it paid for itself in the first workout.",1203724800,3,819,4.671328671328672
2697061,4,B000KRNKNM,"I love this workout because you can get cardio and strength training all in 45 minutes.  She works the arms, legs, abs, back,and glutes.  She keeps your heartrate up too.  The workout starts off with a warm up, then she switches between cardio, arms, and lower body. She even has some kickboxing at the end.  Then she goes to the floor and works your glutes really good then does some abs and then ends it with a nice stretch.  I can see this workout being very effective and easy to keep up with.",1203033600,3,497,4.301075268817204
2697062,4,B000KRNKNM,"I was surprised and pleased that my heartrate stayed elevated throughout the routine, which, for 45 minutes, is very effective in providing a total body workout.  I often find that circuit training under an hour leaves out a couple of muscle groups, but I felt that I got all the good stuff here!  I was especially grateful to the fact that Jeanette includes inner and outer thigh work, instead of just lunges and squats, along with thorough upper body training.  Jeanette's workouts are straightforward with no complicated choreography, so I can recommend this workout to anyone.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I would have liked it to be just a bit longer, with a little more cardio.",1201478400,9,707,4.723577235772358
2697063,5,B000KRNKNM,This is the first DVD I purchased that actually made me feel like I was working my muscles. My lower body was actually sore the next day :)  It is such a great DVD and it goes really fast. The music is great and it really gets you moving. I recommend this DVD for all levels. Enjoy..,1199664000,6,283,3.9649122807017543
2697064,5,B000KRNKNM,"This workout is so much fun, and she really gives you a great workout. She incorporates weights and brings up heart rate with a little bit of kickboxing moves and other simple cardio moves. Very easy to follow as are all her workouts, and she always explains how to modify moves if needed. I love this workout!!",1196985600,8,311,4.473684210526316
2697065,5,B000KRNKNM,"i heard of the hollywood trainer from a free dvd with a sample of her yoga. She inspired m,e so much i bought her whole collection, but this is by far my favourite (followed by her ab blast!) She is motivating, up beat and really knows how to bring on the burn.! You work well and get results.! And you feel like youve done yourself a lot of favours by doing her workouts! She seems to hit most muscle groups which really gives you a whole body workout.!",1192406400,10,454,4.170454545454546
8158822,5,B000KRNKNM,Great cardio video for a great price!,1482364800,,37,4.428571428571429
8158823,5,B000KRNKNM,I received this DVD in the last 2 weeks and it's already becoming a favorite.  It gives a good cardio workout along with some weights.  At the end of 40-45 minutes I feel like I've really exercised.  It brings my heart rate up and works many muscles.  I am so glad I purchased this DVD.,1366502400,,286,4.1454545454545455
8158824,4,B000KRNKNM,"This is a great video. It's challenging (for sure), but fun.  I finally am getting back into working out after having my son (admittedly almost 2 years ago!) and I needed something to make me sweat.  This definitely does the trick, but I also can do it despite the fact that I haven't been working out as much as I should be. It kicks your but!",1317600000,,344,4.196969696969697
8158825,5,B000KRNKNM,You will work your entire body in 45 minutes.  Jeanette makes the workout go by SO fast - and its fun!  This is cardio and light strength training.,1298592000,,147,4.214285714285714
8158826,5,B000KRNKNM,"This is a great workout. If you want a total body burn and are serious about sweating, toning, and getting great results for the time that you invest, this is the workout for you. Love it!!!",1280880000,2,190,4.305555555555555
8158827,4,B000KRNKNM,"Love it, she's very encouraging and energetic and I love the options to choose which part of the workout I want to do and in what order.",1267488000,2,136,4.074074074074074
8158828,3,B000KRNKNM,"I thought that this video would get me sweating like she did in her other video (which I can't remember the name of) but it falls a little short.  Yes, it does make you sweat while you are doing it but once you stop, you cool down rapidly and don't feel like you had a good enough workout.  There is too much weightlifting and lunges and not enough cardio in between to keep the heart rate up.  I'm assumed that since it's called cardiosculpt there would be more cardio in it. I definitely see the sculpting part in the video, and it it makes up most of it.  I haven't done this video in about a week and a half because I don't feel like I sweat enough.  I only do it when I get tired of my other video or when I don't feel like exerting as much as I usually do.",1242864000,3,762,3.954248366013072
8158829,5,B000KRNKNM,Trainer is a PRO!!!! Workout is really effective. You must have a good pre-workout meal otherwise you'll get sick. It's intense.,1234915200,2,128,5.142857142857143
8158830,5,B000KRNKNM,"This is definitely a work out you will feel the next day! She does a great job in incorporating both strength training and cardio, as my heart rate stayed elevated through the entire workout. Unlike many strength training videos, she includes all the major muscle groups ensuring an effective total body workout.",1227225600,,312,5.019230769230769
8158831,5,B000KRNKNM,"This workout is good.  I've only used it twice since I got it, but it worked my legs and arms pretty well- the back of my thighs are sore the next day.  There is a lot of focus on arms in this video- I would have preferred a bit more cardio, but it's still good.

Update: I've had this workout about 10 months now, and it's become one of my faves.  It's a really good workout, and it moves along very fast, so you don't get bored.  it's also not so hard you want to quit.  Love it!  Moving my review to 5 stars.",1216252800,,511,3.855769230769231
