8318904,1,B001LNOLD2,"The digital transfer was terrible. There were times where the audio and visuals on this were so bad that I had to back up and watch again due to poor transfer from a bad copy of this film. Shame on you for duping people with this shoddy copy of a fun flick. I don't give bad reviews easily, but seriously, the transfer was horrible.",1481587200,,332,4.203125
8318905,1,B001LNOLD2,"The quality for this is absolutely atrocious on a technical level. The audio is muddled together, often if two people are talking, or music is playing they collide together into a jumbled cacophony. The visual is possibly the worst transfer I've ever seen (and this is coming from a veteran of both obscure and horror films). I hate to nitpick but even the main menu is an eyesore.

I won't go into detail about plot or acting because they're moot points to discuss over the gargantuan abortion that is the DVD-R of ""The Mutations"". Sinister Cinema....shame on you.",1375401600,4,565,4.76530612244898
8318906,5,B001LNOLD2,"Nice rendition of little known sci-fi thriller in original issue...tough to find in this format, usually found as the Freakmaker.",1374969600,,129,5.5
8318907,5,B001LNOLD2,"I primarily bought this movie because it features Tom Baker (Dr. Who) as the disfigured villain.  Even under all the makeup, you can tell it is classic Tom Baker under the slouch-hat.  If you are upset by sideshow freaks, do not get this movie, as that is much of the theme and the setting.  One wonderful surprise is getting to see Michael Dunn on-screen again.  I so enjoyed his performance as the nefarious genius - Dr. Miguelito Lovelace - on ""The WIld Wild West"".  He died a year after this film was made.

The plot centers around the mad-scientist (Donald Pleasence), his deformed partner (Tom Baker) who is helping the doctor in hopes of having his deformity ""cured"" by the Dr's wild experiments.  The Dr. is trying to cross plants with humans to make us stronger and more able to cope with life in the future.  Many wonderful time-lapse films of plants are included as part of the intro and as part of the experiments.

Side note:  It must have been really, really cold when they were filming this movie.  Even in the scenes that seem to be filmed indoors, you can see the actor's breath condensing in the chill.

A MUST for any serious sci-fi collection ---- especially if you like British sci-fi and in particular - Tom Baker.",1359158400,2,1236,4.568181818181818
8318908,1,B001LNOLD2,"This is one of those horror movies that is so bad it's almost fun to watch. The special effects are horrible and even though there are some good actors (Michael Dunn, Donald Pleasance) in the cast, they're totally wasted. Fans of the sword and sandal genre might be interested in seeing former Hercules Brad Harris in one of his post strongman roles, but this one is so bad that it makes The Fury of Hercules look like high art. Julie Ege is gorgeous and she almost makes a few scenes worth watching, but overall the movie is just terrible. The plot involves a mad scientist trying to bridge the gap between human and plant life. It should have been buried in the far corner of the garden. This one is on my top ten list of the worst movies ever made. It also has one of the worst endings on film.",1333756800,,797,4.28476821192053
8318909,4,B001LNOLD2,"Donald Pleasence stars as the mad scientist. Great soundtrack and atmosphere make for some fun viewing. The circus freaks were a nice attraction,along with the monster freaks the Dr. creates. Better if old low-budget horror movies are something you enjoy....due to the fact that the monster looks rather low-grade  .Imagine something you would find at a halloween costume store for under 100 bucks.",1255737600,2,398,5.317460317460317
8318910,3,B001LNOLD2,"""The Mutations"" is a middling, mostly forgettable horror movie from the mid 70's. Set in trendy London, it tells the tale of a carnival freak show who run a sideline in kidnapping innocent victims to be the subject of evil experiments!

That's all the plot there is, really, and the film doesn't really do a lot with it. It just goes through the motions of showing the freak show, showing some victims get nabbed, and then showing the expected climax. The film has several very silly elements to it. All the kidnapped youngsters are from the same college, and in fact they are all from a single group of  four friends! The experiments themselves are very vaguely explained, but they lead to very dramatic mutated monsters.

As a London resident I also found a lot to enjoy in the locations...is Battersea Park (the location of the carnival in the movie) really such a dangerous foggy wilderness as it is depicted here? (Maybe it was in the 1970's...). And the exterior location for the students college is actually The Royal Albert Hall! They should be so lucky!

Some good points are: Donald Pleasance does his usual good job as a softly spoken but deadly scientist. And Tom Baker does a great job, unrecognisable in ugly face make-up as the scientist's deformed assistant. And the monsterized victims look quite fun, and there's one grisly scene in which a walking plant-thing drains the life out of someone. Although check out a big goof here, where a really big gap between the monster's head and chest suit shows off the actors pink neck in between - which spoils an otherwise effective moment!

There are also a few scenes that showcase some real-life ""freaks"" used in the film, which can't help but seem exploitative. They do get a chance to act, though, in the additional sub-plot in which the freaks rebel against the one among them who is ""the real monster"" - there are heavy echoes of Todd Browning's famous ""Freaks"" here.

To sum up, it's not really very memorable. The whole story is rushed through at great speed, there's no depth to any of the characters (no time!), and everything seems pretty small scale. The scientist's lab is also filmed at Oakley Court, which stood in for a spooky mansion in dozens of British horror movies filmed around this time, such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, And Now The Screaming Starts, Girly, and loads more, so personally, I have seen this place on celluloid far too often!",1246233600,5,2428,4.714622641509434
