3845643,4,B0024F08S8,"Ah, The Girls Next Door.  I've loved this show since the beginning, and this season is awesome.  I was afraid it would be a little lackluster, what with the girls deciding to leave the Mansion, but its such a fun season.  This season is the funniest yet; I think the girls are more comfortable with themselves and are able to really be themselves without fear of censure.  Really, so funny, so fun, a great show.

Unfortunately (like the fourth season) its packaged rather poorly.  Unlike the earlier seasons with individual cases in a nice box set, the three discs are all in one case which is a little flimsy.  All in all, the show is worth buying for the sheer fun of it, not the packaging.",1245974400,4,693,4.4523809523809526
3845644,5,B0024F08S8,"Fun show, I was sad to watch it end. But, the spinoff shows will keep me entertained.

3845646,5,B0024F08S8,Miss this show. Season 5 wasn't as good as the other seasons and since I have read Kendra's and Hollys book...I understand why the 5th season sort of lacked in comparison to the other seasons. The 5th season showed more of girls REAL personality and showed them living lives of there own even though they still shared a boyfriend and lived together they seemed to really grown up and got used to this business. The girls really jumped shipped before they got the respect and credit for what they did for reality TV.,1442707200,,515,4.548387096774194

3845650,3,B0024F08S8,"Well...I have to confess that I'm rather sad to see this series come to an end. Not because I felt that it needed to go on longer (and I guess technically it DID go on longer, extended through a sixth season which pretty much a whole new cast), but because at its highest point I really enjoyed it and went through a lot of life changes over the same five years that it aired with Holly, Bridget and Kendra.

As seasons of this series go, this one wasn't the best. There were only 16 episodes and a lot of rehashing. Even the commentary track, which typically has been one of the high points of these DVD releases, was filled with a lot of dead air and not as much behind-the-scenes background tidbits as other releases. But it still was watchable and entertaining, particularly because it was pretty packed with nudity. The couple of seasons before this one had strayed away from that formula a bit.

Probably saddest of all to me has been the complete collapse of the Playboy empire in the years since this show limped to its conclusion. It really has been something to see. It could be (and has been) argued that Playboy launched the sexual revolution. It was a juggernaut in the '50s and '60s before getting its head kicked in in the '70s for being, of all things, too conservative for audiences. It nearly died in the '80s before being revived by home video and its cable channel and strengthened in the '90s largely because of the star power of Carmen Electra, Jenny McCarthy, Anna Nicole Smith and of course, Pamela Anderson. But Playboy was in a precarious position again by the mid 2000s, again because it was too conservative for mainstream audiences who could get hard-core pornography for free anytime on the Internet.

And then this show came along and actually vaulted the Playboy brand to unforeseen and unprecedented heights. For its first three years it soared, opening Playboy up to a whole new, and young, world. Suddenly every girl wanted that little rabbit head on her body.

Just like every other reality series, though, ""The Girls Next Door"" had a shelf life, and when it died, the last gasp of the Playboy empire died with it. You had the unfortunate convergence of an aged corporate figurehead whose health began failing, the loss of the brand's biggest stars, a kind of public exhaustion brought about by overexposure and--probably the nail in the coffin--the inability of the crumbling empire to evolve adequately with the times. Specifically, nobody buys magazines anymore, even ones with gorgeous naked women all through them. Playboy never really seemed to figure out how to make the Internet work for itself.

So anyway, all of that has been very sad for me to see, and it's my guess that this show will for all time remain the last relevance of a dying iconic American brand. You have to wonder though if Kendra, Holly and Bridget realized it. They certainly didn't in 2009 when this season wrapped, but they might today. And if they don't today, surely they will one day. I think that all of us will.",1425081600,6,3033,4.661682242990654

3845656,5,B0024F08S8,"I believe this DVD set of Season Five is the last and final season of Girls Next Door with Holly Madison, Bridget Marquadt and Kendra Wilkinson-Baskett.

There were so many things I learned about the mansion. The notoriously famous and generous Hugh Hefner, Hef's huge staff, the big house, including a huge, professional kitchen, with a menu to boot! The best thing about the show, however were those 3 fun loving girls who brightened Hef's life on a daily basis. It's unfortunate, but the first season the girl's worked for nothing! When the second season was nearing, the girl's approached Hef (who is the boss - it's his house) and voiced their opinions regarding earning salary while putting in long hours on this ever-so-popular reality show. The girl's won - much due in part to Hef.

There were 4 seasons of Girl's Next Door and it ended around 2009. The girl's went their own ways, and a spin-off was created for the most popular player in the house, Kendra Wilkinson. The show, simply called ""Kendra"" went on to be a very popular and successful show. It showed her gorgeous wedding to Hank Baskett, and the birth of their son, Hank Baskett the IV. He's so beautiful!  Kendra can be found on WE (Women's Entertainment) in a very similar type show, called ""Kendra on Top,"" except, imo it is directed and written much better than the series on E!

Holly has done an array of different things. She was in a Las Vegas Show, which was right up Holly's alley, and even though it required a lot of nudity, if you remember all the GND's, I think you'd remember those girls just charged around the mansion in their birthday suit! lol

Holly also did another show, ""Holly's World,"" which was a bit campy, somewhat interesting, but Holly Madison is just one bag of trouble and woe. What happened to Bridget. On the show it portrayed Bridget as the smart girl. And she really was, w/ 2 Master degree's under her belt in Communications. She was interested in a few specific things that I can remember: Halloween, Horror movies and her love for either directing, producing, writing and/or starring in her own films.

After Girl's Next Door wrapped it's final season, Bridget signed a contract with The Travel Channel to host a fun-filled weekly show about different parts of the world, I think it was all beaches if I can remember. lol. I remember Bridgett laughing about how light her wardrobe was going to be, b/c she was packing, I believe she confirmed she had about 150 bikinis! Wow. lol.  I don't know what happened to that show, though.

Anyway, all good things come to an end. Hef ended up marrying a fickle bride named Crystal Harris.  She's like 70 years younger than Hef and so in love with him. Yeah, I hope she keeps remembering that!  Finally, on a sad note Mary O'Connor, Hef's long-time secretary/assistant passed away. :(  I loved Mary O'Connor!",1387843200,,2857,4.671314741035856

3845672,4,B0024F08S8,"I am NOT a Playboy fan.  Never have been, never will be.
Winter 2009 I watched a couple of episodes & became a fan of the ladies Bridget & Holly.  I like Kendra more now then I did at the beginning.
So, I am a late bloomer to be a fan of the show.

Of course, my favorite part of the 5 seasons on DVD is the girls commentary.  Love to listen to that.
Good episode, Bridget's sister Anastasia's birthday trip.  Going to Knott's Berry Farm in Pleading the 55th part 2.

Bridget, Holly & Kendra ARE THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR.  Not those short term replacements because TGND franchise is now dead because the girls moved on.

Like the twins lasted a long time.  Dumb as stumps.

Ok, as for the DVD package.  This season & season 4 were NOT put in the good card board holder with a separate case for each DVD.  Nope, we have a thin, cheap plastic holder & the DVD's badly input inside.

Also, Bridget was on disc 2 of seasons 1 through 4 DVD sets, but here they put Kendra on this last season

AND, A MISSING EPISODE.  Where, oh where, is the hour long episode when Bridget goes to do her Travel channel show & Kendra moves out?  I so wanted to see this episode on here BECAUSE I SO WANTED TO HEAR THE GIRLS COMMENTARY ON THIS EPISODE.

The talk between Hugh (Hef) & Mary about the girls leaving & Holly not being happy.  THIS EPISODE WAS SO NEEDED HERE.  A loss that it is NOT.",1267833600,2,1367,4.109848484848484

I turned to the internet to get a list of all the episodes and they left out 4 episodes!!  I bought the disc from Amazon, and i don't know whose to blame but Disc two is ALWAYS bridgets and on the disc theres Kendra and on the home screen for the dvd theres a picture of Bridget and vice versa for disc three.

3845679,4,B0024F08S8,"I think all GND fans agree that the main reason we buy the DVDs is for the commentary from the three girls and the behind the scenes scoop (Kendra identifying Audra as the VS giftcard thief). Unfortunately, for those of us who watched Season 4 I believe Holly said at the end that they would be back the following week to do their Season 5 commentary. At that time it was early December (based on things they said i.e. getting dresses for NYE, etc) so Holly's relationship with Criss was still fresh, Bridget was starting to film Bridget's Beaches, and Kendra wasn't engaged yet. I kinda wish they waited to do the commentary until March or April after things settled/changed a bit (DWTS, Holly/Criss breakup, etc). But regardless, this was a good season with lots of fun episodes and the commentary is still fun.",1247356800,5,813,4.652777777777778
3845680,5,B0024F08S8,"Season 5 of the Girls Next Door doesn't disappoint and of course the commentary of the girls for each episode is the icing on the cake (as Bridget likes to say).  We have followed these 3 Girls during part of their exciting life at the Playboy Mansion and it helped to give some insight on what it's like to be one of Hef's girlfriends.  With Kendra now being married, Bridget having her own Travel show and Holly just starting her stint on ""Peepshow"" in Vegas I can only hope that the next season with the new girlfriends will make us smile as these three did!",1246320000,7,561,4.333333333333333
3845681,3,B0024F08S8,"First of all, I'm a HUGE GND fan. I've been watching since the very beginning, and have gotten many friends hooked. It was also fun being a bit of a neighbor, as until recently I lived in Beverly Hills.

This season was a big disappointment for me though. Perhaps it's because I had my hopes up. I knew it was going to be the final season, and I was hoping things would play out more to ""reality"". The shows in this season seem more acted/scripted than any of the previous seasons. These girls are NOT actors by any stretch, so it seemed like they were struggling at some points with what to say. Funny how reality wouldn't do that to you, huh? Also, (maybe this is just because I lived in LA?) at the time this was being filmed, Holly was dating Criss Angel, and Kendra had already started seeing Hank. None of this was mentioned, they ""acted"" like the same old crew, yet you see Holly perpetually wearing ""Mindfreak"" paraphernalia.

I read through another reviewer that the final episode was not included. Maybe that's for the best. I found that to be the most mind numbing episode. The whole episode centered around Kendra, as a segue to her new show. I don't think this really did justice to the girls as a whole. There was a little bit toward Briget, also to push her new travel channel show. However, Holly was completely left out. They threw in a bit with Hef at the end saying he felt that ""something was wrong"" with Holly, that she might leave...ummm...she'd been dating Criss for some time at this point!!!

All in all this season proved that none of this is even close to reality t.v. The heavy scripting in this season really hurt it as a whole for me. I was really sad to see that the girls didn't go about this in their own spirit, and just let loose with what was really happening in their lives. I think it would have made a more solid farewell.",1246147200,2,1861,4.372832369942197
3845682,3,B0024F08S8,"I did enjoyed the 5th season, however, on the commentary, it was a little disappointing that at some points none of the girls had seen the episodes, so they were watching with ""virgin eyes.""  There were several times with no comments because the girls were watching the episode and quite a few times saying ,""oh they didn't show this or are they going to show that.""  And freqently asking each other, 'what was that? what did he/she just say?'

Also, the 2-part episode with Kendra and Bridget moving out is not included at all. Maybe they are considered part of season 6.",1246147200,2,572,4.588235294117647
8350457,5,B0024F08S8,"Usually--or at least I, myself--like to watch tv shows in their chronological order, to see how they progress over the seasons. Then you realize why you watch some shows and remember, yeah--the ""continuity"" of this show really matters. Sometimes, i wonder if Amazon reviews need a grin smiley. In any case, if anybody isn't watching this show for the 3 main stars, maybe there is something unusual about it?

Sarcasm aside, I did realize this was the last season with Kendra, Bridget and Holly, so yeah, maybe you do have to draw a line sometimes and not watch everything. Favorite episode--maybe softball, maybe all of them. I saw another review talking about the death of print, even girlie magazines and started thinking about this very show.

Who needs magazines when there is this thing called the ""interwebs"" and maybe the DVDs themselves. If this wasn't sarcastic enough, I'll just say I really like this show...",1528156800,,919,4.922580645161291
