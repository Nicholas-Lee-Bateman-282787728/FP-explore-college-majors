5683196,5,B00BZV1AOI,"Really enjoy the series,esp any scene with Hattie and Ken Williams. Hattie lights up the screen and is a beautiful woman. Such talent assembled under one roof,it's a shame they were never properly shown with decent pay.",1419379200,2,219,4.945945945945946
5683197,5,B00BZV1AOI,A Classic British comedy series that never gets too dull to watch over and over! If you like British comedy you have to check out the Carry On series.,1389484800,,150,4.206896551724138

5683201,5,B00BZV1AOI,"A collection of some of the the carry-on films. They must be experienced to be understood, and repeated viewing and familiarity with the ensemble cast enhances enjoyment. They contain occasional awful moments but are still some of the very best of British humor. Up there with Fawlty Towers and Monty Python. Possibly even better.",1451952000,2,330,5.12962962962963
5683202,5,B00BZV1AOI,Love the British humour.  Loved it.,1439856000,,35,4.833333333333333
5683203,5,B00BZV1AOI,"Need a laugh on a bad day? I put one of these on and a smile instantly comes to my face. Silly and antiquated, but classic and simply delightful. I hope another generation picks up the brand name and relaunches this series.",1439510400,6,223,4.333333333333333
5683204,5,B00BZV1AOI,"Brilliant, wonderful and quite splendid. The 'Carry On' comedy film series (and this is only a small slice) is a part of British cinematic film history. If you are in need of anti-political-correctness medication, then self prescribe yourself a dose of these movies. This is proof why the British (and Irish) have the best sense of humor in the entire universe.",1438819200,,361,4.934426229508197

5683207,5,B00BZV1AOI,If you like slapstick and great characters....this will do the trick!!!!  Dare you not to laugh while you watch these episodes!,1426118400,3,127,5.0476190476190474
5683208,5,B00BZV1AOI,Just as funny as I remember.,1424476800,,28,3.8333333333333335
5683209,3,B00BZV1AOI,Only 4 of the 8 films are anamorphic while the other 4 are letterboxed. This was a major disappointment and there is nothing about that in the description. Picture quality is good otherwise.,1422230400,,190,4.787878787878788

8575926,5,B00BZV1AOI,Love the innuendo  filled slightly raunchy British comedies of the 1960's and the early 1970's just like this collection. Love it!,1509062400,,130,5.190476190476191
8575927,4,B00BZV1AOI,"This collection has subtitles, which is helpful for the hearing-challenged and catching all the nuances in the fast-talking English comedy.",1498176000,,139,6.0
8575928,5,B00BZV1AOI,"Oh how we adore these movies! I grew up on the Carry On series although didn't get to see them all!  Kenneth Williams was always my firm favorite and wished he appeared in all of them (although he appears in most).  This collection contains;  Carry On Camel, Don't Lose Your Head (a hilarious take on the French Revolution), Up The Khyber (a great humorous take at the British Khyber Pass era), Doctor, Camping, Again Doctor, Jungle and Carry On Loving.  All are excellent with Carry on Follow That Camel being a hilarious take on The Four Feathers.  Many regulars who appeared in most if not all the Carry On films are favorites such as Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, Charles Hawtrey (a real life character), Sid James (always a lovable favorite and quite the ladies man in films and out), Frankie Howard, Joan Sims, Hattie Jacques, Jim Dale, Angela Douglas, Liz Fraser (who also appeared in a Rumpole episode), Barbara Windsor (an adorable blond who in real life had a long term relationship with Sid James), Bernard Bresslaw (a most talented comic who was lost to us far too soon).  Perhaps three of the Carry On series were less than stellar with Carry On Columbus easily being the worst.  Carry On England has its merits and is enjoyable albeit it lacking in creativity and storyline. Carry On Emmanuele wasn't quite as bad as critics' remarks about it.  Each one of course is loaded with double entendres with almost every sentence containing at least one sexual reference some not so vague as well as creatively funny observances and uses of the English language.  They don't make 'em like this anymore!",1492732800,2,1613,4.773381294964029
8575929,5,B00BZV1AOI,full of double entendres from start to finish. Hilarious wit at it's British best.,1492646400,,82,4.928571428571429
8575930,4,B00BZV1AOI,Decent quality CD. Great if you like old British movies.,1487721600,,56,4.7
8575931,5,B00BZV1AOI,ok,1486684800,,2,2.0
8575932,3,B00BZV1AOI,As with Vol. 2 this volume had the same issue with the second disk not playing.  I guess you get what you pay for but now I have a very disappointed husband after getting burned again on this deal,1459382400,5,196,4.0256410256410255
8575933,5,B00BZV1AOI,"For ""Carry ON..."" fans, a veritable smorgasbord of this unique brand of slap-stick and farce. Worth every penny, or perhap every pun-ny!
The movie was very well packaged, arrived in wonderful condition and very promptly.",1459036800,,220,5.314285714285714
