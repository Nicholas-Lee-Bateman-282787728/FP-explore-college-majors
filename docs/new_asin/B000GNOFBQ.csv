2615237,5,B000GNOFBQ,"The movie is absolutely great. It's a classic French movie that shows all the beauty of classics, where there is no violence, only beautiful scenes that make your eyes happy.",1169078400,9,174,4.833333333333333
8133413,4,B000GNOFBQ,"I'm convinced that if Louis de Funs had enough screentime, he could carry any movie. He's the kind of gifted performer who could pretty much win the world over with his comedic charms. In L'homme Orchestre, he acts as a proud, uptight, and overbearing director of an all-female dance troupe. His character's high-strung controlling half is constantly wrestling with his gentle saccharine half displaying the kind of personality anybody could find humor with. De Funs is a master of comical expressions and this movie is undoubtedly a great showcase of that talent. One specific example of his facial expertise is when he's behind the stage curtain guiding and cheering on his dancers like an overly proud mother. Whenever he sports some dance moves, expect to let out some giggles and/or belly laughs. Despite a few dull moments, the fun always returns to infuse the audience with that feel-good sensation just as any comedy should.

Like a Marx Brothers movie, the plot is really secondary to the silliness and humor. It's not important to have a fondness for dance or to understand French to enjoy this movie. What's important is letting yourself go to allow the humor of Louis De Funs delight you. (3.5 stars)

(n.b. For the viewer out there who has a weakness for cuteness, you won't want to miss the sweet interactions between De Funs and two plump babies.)",1467936000,,1362,4.891774891774892
8133414,5,B000GNOFBQ,Such a fantastic film. One of my favorites from de Funes. His acting in this movie is just phenomenal. This is French cinema in its purest form! Highly recommend.,1450828800,,162,4.620689655172414
8133415,3,B000GNOFBQ,"Unfortunately, it is the French version with no English subtitles.  So even though I saw this movie many years ago with the English subtitles, and loved it, I cannot enjoy this one because I was given incorrect information (that it did have English subtitles).  If you understand French, it is a very funny, side-splitting film.  But it does help if you understand everything that is happening.",1445644800,3,394,4.9393939393939394
8133416,4,B000GNOFBQ,"This version is French only without subtitles.  Louis de Fues is amusing even if you can't understand him, but if you don't understand French, I recommend not getting this video.",1379548800,,178,4.933333333333334
8133417,5,B000GNOFBQ,"These are great souvenirs for the french and haitian community. My parents watched these shows for a long time. Jumped into my car with my brilliant Christmas gift idea, for my future father in-law and sped to Blockbuster-thinking they would have everything! They didn't:( Not knowing where else to turn, I gave up. A few days later realised all my book, music and DVD purchases were made on Amamzon! Amazon makes all things ""foreign"" seem attainable and accessible. Thank you very much. Amazon is just always on top of things! DVD was in reat condition. Well wrapped. No dents.",1297641600,,578,4.848484848484849
8133418,5,B000GNOFBQ,"This movie is one of my favorite comedies with Louis de Funes; Louis de Funes was a genius!  His sense of timing (he was an excellent musician) and extraordinary comic sense make him the best!  Excellent, excellent comedy!  Also you discover la Cote d'Azur and Italy, beautifully filmed....",1296259200,,290,5.0
8133419,2,B000GNOFBQ,"De Funes, what i remember on past years, he is a good comedien, happened that this special movie of him is not good at all..i am sorry that i choose a wrong one. If you expecting a good movie you will be disapointed.",1245196800,,216,4.046511627906977
8133420,5,B000GNOFBQ,This one shares some of the best of De Funes and his special talents. He is wonderfully funny and has the most amusing gestures for his characters. It was very entertaining and for anyone who loves dance this is excellent!,1217203200,2,222,4.575
8133421,5,B000GNOFBQ,"Even without understanding French, Louis De Funes is such a talented comedian that it is a joy to watch.  He is so animated and expressive that so much can be comprehended.  Attractive girls and the scenes of France and Italy in themselves can be enjoyed.  I bought two copies and gave one as a gift which my friend has enjoyed watching.  De Funes substantiates that humor is a universal language.",1214265600,6,397,4.628571428571429
8133422,5,B000GNOFBQ,"L'homme orchestre  avec Louis de Funes est un film formidable.
C'est l'un des meilleur filmes par Louis de Funes.
Beaucoup d'action, et vous serez rime sans arrette.

If you do not understand my commentary in the French language,
(This Film is in French) then you will not be able to obtain the complete understanding of this film taken in Europe.",1195948800,7,347,4.766666666666667
