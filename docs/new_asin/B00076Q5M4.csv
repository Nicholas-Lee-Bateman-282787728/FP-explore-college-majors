8082439,5,B00076Q5M4,"A real eye opener to anybody who wonders what formula one racing was like in the early 70's.  The driver interviews are insightful and ponient.  Probably the best documentary on dangerous motor sports not just formula one.  You could apply the drivers disconnect with danger with other racing, i.e.  Unlimited hydroplanes, NHRA drag racers, Indy cars, and the like.  Still waiting for  this to be released on dvd or blue ray.  Racing today is a mere shadow of risk that drivers deal with.  It's all very well calculated for maximum dollar earnings for owners and racing associations and TV.  If you get a chance to see this take a watch and hoist a cold one for those men that paid the price of driving for the love of it.",1380153600,,722,4.534883720930233
8082440,5,B00076Q5M4,"I am anxiously awaiting a DVD release of this WONDERFUL essay on motorsports...

It seems to be aimed at celebrating the Formula 1 championship season of Francois Cevert... but he exits... stage left... at Watkins Glen after waving to the camera (while NOT noticing that his tyre is deflating... pitching him into the Armco Barrier... Fatally) at the end...

It starts with Kyalami, South Africa... a car off, Drivers left... Two corner marshalls run across the track to assist...

Let me rephrase that,... Two corner marshalls TRY to run across the track...  Result... one corner marshall bi-sected... Tom Pryce, driving for Team Shadow...  with a Fire Bottle in the face ...

Well let us just say that This documentary is a montage of beauty, excess, joy, tradegy and speed that should NOT be missed by ANY F-1 fan... For that matter, anyone who truly appreciates True MOTOR RACING...
