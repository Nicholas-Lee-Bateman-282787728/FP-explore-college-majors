8212669,5,B000UAE7TA,"I bought this set and to get the first 5 season all at once was well worth the wait.
I have had episodes taped of Wings for years off of NBC and USA but in time they were all scattered about.
When they came to Nick at Night and then TV Land I knew it would take too much effort to start over and stay organized.
SO that's when I hopped online.
This was the way to go.
It's a bit exspensive but when you receive this many DVDs in the mail at once and you know it's the entire pre Casey Wings discogrophy, it's well worth it.
The last few seasons of Wings was still good because you love the characters but once Casey arrives and Joe and Helen got together for good it was never quite as good as the first 5 seasons.
To receive all of those at once was really cool as hell.",1202256000,5,771,3.917197452229299
8212670,5,B000UAE7TA,"Wings is one of my favorite television shows of all time. It was great to finally see the episodes again, uncut. Watching these DVDs reinforces what a great series Wings was.

If anyone doubts the acting ability of Tim Daly, they need only to watch ""Mother Wore Stripes"" and ""Love is Like Pulling Teeth"" from season 2. He handles both the drama and comedy equally well. And don't forget ""Joe Blows"" parts 1 and 2 from season 5. Some of the best TV ever.

The DVDs are great. I've read some reviews that commented on poor video quality. After reading that, I was a bit reluctant to order this set, but I've had absolutely no issues with video quality. I've played the DVDs on both new, state of the art equipment (TV and DVD player), as well as older equipment (a 20 year old TV) and have not experienced any issues.

If you love comedy, you must have Wings in your collection.",1200614400,8,876,4.395061728395062
