3012446,1,B000Y7U982,"This movie is a complete waste of time, find something else better to do than watch this wantabee horror flick.",1200787200,7,111,4.6
3012447,2,B000Y7U982,"(2.5 *'s) There's no doubt there's something familiar about Joshua (Jacob Kogan).  In opening scenes we see him at the piano performing songs for his Uncle Ned (Dallas Roberts) his mother, Abby (Vera Farmiga), and his father, Brad (Sam Rockwell).  His mother holds their newborn daughter in her arms as his uncle encourages him while he plays.  The family is happy about the new addition, but like many families, they try to give special attention to the first born, who is nine and practicing for a school recital.  We soon realize in the absent monotone in Joshua's voice that something is indeed wrong.  At different points in the film, he asks his parents separately if they love him.

The film basically goes forward in chronological order.  Captions show the development of the baby: (e.g. ...31 days, 47 days..., etc.), and we see that the infant is more demanding than most.  At one point, the baby has cried for five days straight, and Abby is under medication.  Much of the movie tries to find a solution for the unraveling mother and a baby that no one seems to have a handle on.  Just around the corner during the late night awakenings is Joshua, who startles mother, dad, and audience.  Dad is losing footing at work where his boss, Chester, is seeing everything fall apart.  It doesn't help Brad that a series of crises send him home when the prospects at work seem so bleak.

To demonstrate Joshua's familiarity, in one scene he is staring vacantly just outside the doorway.  In the other room his parents are trying to calm their little one as if she had a colic.  The whole scene had an uncanny resemblance to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-25th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/079073804X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;when the mother is making a long-distance call. Then, at a piano reception in the living room, Joshua lets out some bodily fluids on the floor.  Perhaps not the same fluids as a similar scene, but fluids just the same, and both movies suggest there's more than nerves working in the young child's life.

At one point at the breakfast table, Joshua announces that someone has died in their house.  The parents are incredulous, but not yet alarmed by this peculiar statement.  Flashing forward, there's a scene with a discovery about Joshua's drawings, and in both cases it's more than a little reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>.  He's even attending a private school and wearing a suit and tie at the table.

The filmmakers seemed to center their movie around a theme and used elements of other movies as its primary plot thrust.  Brad shows some genuine affection for his first born son.  He's a loving and caring father, but in one scene at work he's telling an ethnic joke that has all but been outlawed nowadays.  The development is startling--too deliberate to be a deleted scene.  Also, the family is mixed:  Abby is Jewish and Brad is Christian.  As a subplot, Brad's mother, Hazel (Celia Watson, playing a minor variation of her role in 'Junebug') is a born-again Christian.  She takes Joshua to a revival prayer service without either parent's permission.  Much like 'All in the Family' when Archie baptizes little Joey without their parents' consent, Brad and Abby are upset, having arranged to allow the child's faith to be nurtured their own way.

There are four points I admire about 'Joshua'.  One is that despite the dead ringer elements of other movies (and here I must include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000EYK4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Son/dp/B00013RC7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Son</a>&nbsp;to the list) the movie managed to instill a sense of suspense.  Also, the acting is either genuine to genuinely good.  Vera Farmiga is perhaps the best in the show, reaffirming what she's been able to do in the past.  Jacob Kogan is no Hailey Joel Osment or Abigail Breslin, but he's mostly a believable child actor nonetheless.  The supporting cast, including Rockwell and Weston, keep it real throughout.  Thirdly, there are so many more developments that take place that I haven't mentioned.  There are other scenes that definitely keep one's interest.  The other asset is that the resolution is totally unpredictable.

If the film hadn't been so derivative, I would have given the movie three and a half stars.  Nowadays it is seldom that you find any film that doesn't have some elements from other movies, but these resemblances were so uncanny, it separated the difference between a film that borrows and one that's cut-and-paste*.

(*Leonard Maltin uses the term ""cookie cutter,"" which is basically the same concept here.)",1200096000,7,5116,5.617992177314211
3012448,4,B000Y7U982,"The promotion and packaging material for this movie go to considerable effort to suggest that it is yet another clone of ""The Omen"" and similar films.  Indeed, the title character bears more than a passing resemblance, and a few scenes are staged as neat little hommages to the ""evil demonic child"" school of filmmaking.

But the demon here is no supernatural creation.  He evolves before your very eyes in the person of a nine year old boy, who may have the roots of a personality disorder....or may be responding to the birth of a new child in the family and to postpartum depression suffered by his mother.  Whatever the reason, Joshua moves through (and ultimately, just moves) a story which stumbles a few times but more often than not leads the viewer down an unexpected path....and into a building dread which grows steadily throughout the film to a climax you're not likely to forget--on several levels, actually.  Prepare to have several of your fears played upon to great effect--even if you didn't think you were particularly afraid of them.  You may well find yourself saying aloud as you realize it: ""but....all of this actually happens....""

No big-name cast here, but by and large the acting is quite capable (the actor who portrays Joshua is especially riveting and incredibly subtle for a child), the writing might well have inspired jealousy from Alfred Hitchcock, and the camera is almost a character in the film itself, sliding around corners and down claustrophobic corridors in such a way that you half expect it to look over its shoulder at times.  The use of music at several points is extremely effective--it's worth sitting through the credits to let the story's final chill running down your spine sink in properly.

Come prepared to pay attention--and to encounter a few scenes that seem a bit uncertain.  But give this movie a chance, let it draw you in.  I can almost guarantee that it will not let go of you easily.",1199836800,4,1946,4.813813813813814
3012449,4,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is hauntingly beautiful in its music, cinematography and direction. It may not be an original concept, but it's well-done. It has its flaws though - it runs a bit longer than it should, and a main character vanishes halfway through. If you like your horror subtle, ambiguous, and thought-provoking, definitely check this out. I believe it'll gain more appreciation over time.",1199836800,2,382,5.17741935483871
3012450,4,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is about a young boy living in New York with his seemingly perfect
parents.  He is an accomplished piano player, and rejects sports, which
is somewhat disappointing to his father.  He is always perfectly groomed,
and highly intellectual.  Early on, however, it is clear that there is a
sinister side to Joshua, which becomes increasingly evident following the
birth of a little sister.  Side characters include the fathers parents,
who are Christian Fundamentalists, and Joshua's Uncle, (Mom's brother).
Joshua's mother is suffering from post-partum depression and has symptoms
of schizophrenia, and his dad is trying to keep things together.  Slowly, bad things keep happening, which usually point to Joshua, though nobody
wants to acknowledge the possibility.  Does he want to eliminate his
sister?  His parents?  The movie is increasingly tense and creepy, and
the climax is interesting, to say the least.  The film is overall less
satisfying than the original ""Bad Seed"" with Patty McCormack, probably
because Joshua is not portrayed quite as charming and likable when not
in distress or under suspicion.  Still, the film is well acted and keeps
you guessing and nervous.  Worth seeing if you like a psychological
thriller.",1199836800,3,1234,5.309278350515464
3012451,4,B000Y7U982,"""Joshua"" is set in New York city and focuses on a young family comprising of Brad and Abby Cairn [Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga], who seem to lead a charmed life. Brad has a well-paying job, they live in a comfortable city apartment, and they have a 9-year-old son, Joshua [Jacob Kogan] who is also a gifted pianist. There is also a new baby, Lily who seems like a perfect child, quiet and lovable, but this seemingly perfect family portrait slowly unravels into a nightmarish horror as the family is plunged into one crisis after another.

It appears that harmless little Joshua, of the quiet and unassuming character, is not so benign after all. In fact, far from it - Lily's birth seems to be the catalyst that brings forth his psychopathic behavior [arguably simmering within him all along]. At first, the problems seem to have ordinary reasons - Abby seems unable to cope with the demands of motherhood [understandable given her history of depression and PPD], dad Brad seems to be the quintessential good guy, a supportive husband and dad trying to balance the demands of work and family, but the audience is never kept in the dark as to the sinister force behind the family's problems.

The acting was surprisingly good given that the main actors are not really well-known.  Brad Cairn [as played by Sam Rockwell] makes a convincing husband and father and is the proverbial good guy in a bad situation. Vera Farmiga is also believable as Abby Cairn, whose misery at being unable to cope with a fussy infant and the demands of being a wife and mother added to her battle with depression is very convincing indeed - except that you tend to wonder - why does she refuse to seek help [no nanny, housekeeper, or even family rule?]. This does stretch the credulity level a bit, but still works on-screen. There is a supportive brother Ned [Dallas Roberts] who is well-liked by all, yes, even by Joshua. Too bad he doesn't appear in too many scenes. There is the zealous Christian grandmother [Celia Weston] and of course Joshua himself, played ably by Jacob Kogan. His Joshua is well-groomed at all times [nary a hair out of place],and projects a quiet sort of malevolence that permeates the scenes he appears in, and even when he isn't there, the score and sets add to the sinister atmosphere.

For fans of psychological horror, Joshua is very much reminiscent of classics like The Bad Seed [remember Rhoda?], and The Other, even The Good Son, and if you haven't seen those movies, you might want to check them out. All of them are highly atmospheric and thought-provoking. As for Joshua, it is a well-paced psychological thriller that is worth a few squirms, at least!",1199836800,36,2671,4.725321888412017
3012452,4,B000Y7U982,"This is the story of a young, upper-middle class family, living from what all outside appearances, seems to be a charmed life.  Successful Father, loving Mother, gifted 9 year old son, and a beautiful newborn baby girl.
But, the parents don't seem to notice that the birth of their Daughter, has brought some dark & very sinister behaviour out in their 9 year old old Son, Joshua. Soon, unexplained events tear the family apart, driving the Mother mad, the baby's life is in danger, and the Father soon comes to realize that his gifted 9 year old son, is a phychotic little monster.
This film is not filled with gore, or in-your-face horror.  I find it all the more disturbing, because everything is done in a subtle fashion, making the story very believable.  The child actor that portrays Joshua, is truely amazing, he's not over-the-top, but very effective.  When he starts playing the piano and singing at the end of the film, I was truely creeped out.  I would reccomend this film to anyone who has enjoyed films like The Others, The Bad Seed, & The Omen.",1199836800,3,1060,4.647058823529412
3012453,5,B000Y7U982,"Marketed as an indie clone of ""The Omen,"" ""Joshua"" is closer in spirit to the films of Luis Bunuel, or Pasolini's ""Teorema.""  An upwardly mobile bourgeois couple having moved to Fifth Avenue to raise a family never absorbs the fact that their son, growing up on Fifth Avenue, is of a different class.  That is the source of both the comedy and the tragedy in this supremely assured, flawlessly crafted, gleefully morbid, quintissentially American movie.

I found the pacing just right, the acting solid, and the suspenseful/creepy factor consistently high. This movie is a psychological thriller, so if you go into it with the expectation of a jump scare fiesta like people have come to associate with horror you'll come away disappointed. Actually, you'd dislike the vast majority of the movies I like and we probably shouldn't have a movie night together.

Actually, I was going to give this movie four stars but I'm going to give it five to combat the unnecessarily harsh reviews. For me, it kept me engrossed in the story, rooting for the protagonist, and left off on a decidedly creepy note. I'd like to see more movies of this caliber.",1501027200,3,815,4.73943661971831

3012483,5,B000Y7U982,"I am a little late in reviewing this and I will be the first to admit that I don't know squat about cinematography and all that jazz I will say I loved the film. I had been putting off watching it for quite a while because I really wasn't sure where it was going. I know some other reviewers mention that it was somewhat the mothers fault from postpartum depression that caused her son to turn out the way he did but I wholeheartedly believe some kids are just born sh*****. He is a narcissistic self serving little prick - in my personal opinion.

If you are looking for a neat little thriller - i don't want to call it a psychological thriller which is how it was advertised to me because I think you can figure out quite early what is going on - this is a good movie to spend some time on. In all fairness I probably won't be rewatching it because there are a few movies somewhat like it but it def doesnt change the fact I did enjoy the time I spent watching it (which is all that matters as far as I am concerned)

LOVED THE ENDING SONG I mean that thing still gets stuck in my head....super creepy

Spoiler Alert Here - I seriously wonder how much blame you can put on parents when you are willing to shove your grandmother down some stairs to kill her when from all that I can see in the movie besides some severe stress from the mother and such there is no emotional or physical abuse to this boy. He is extremely intelligent and feels like he is misunderstood from what I can gather. Hence his strong desire to be with his uncle at the very end.",1484611200,,1554,4.156146179401993

Of the 3 'evil children' movies I've seen lately this is my least favorite.

3012549,4,B000Y7U982,"I was less interested in the horror aspects of the film (although I find that PG-13 level thrillers can be fun) than in the characterization of giftedness.  As with countless films, people's fear of ""evil genius"" gets exploited (and reinforced) yet again.  But in this case, there was a lot of extra care taken in providing a more creditable presentation.  The film turned out to be just as good as I'd been hoping for, in which the horror elements actually become existential - - the title character, and some surprisingly strong additional characters, all question in different ways what leads people to care for each other, and whether such feelings and compulsions are defensible and worthwhile.  Since this is obviously a very unsettling line of thought, treating it in terms of a thriller is one tangent that allows such a subject to be explored in a new manner.  The bases for human trust are shown as destabilized when a youngster who one would normally think is too helpless and innocent to harm anyone turns out instead to be capable of dedicated efforts to out-think those around him.  One interesting problem is that the chracter ***is*** too young to understand that his family are indeed far better people, despite their flaws, than most strangers would be.  If Joshua had been more fully exposed to the heartlessness of strangers, he might have been more appreciative and less eager to rile things up by exploring dark things.  For all that we know, the origin of his feelings of this type had started with the birth of a sibling, at the start of the film.  The piano rhapsody on ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" (originally a theme by Mozart - a fact that Joshua would know even if most adults wouldn't) was BRILLIANT!  It suggests that the problem may have partially been rooted in an inability for others to sufficiently relate to and engage Joshua's genius, causing it to go into warped directions that I think would untimately be self-destructive.  Instead of lurid horror, what we have here is actually a very solid character-based drama.  I cannot fully endorse the immoral aspects within the plot, but for adult viewers, I feel that this is a solid and challenging work that pushes strongly at the limitations that the horror/thriller genre normally tends to impose.  And realistically, would this work have made it to video for widespread viewing if it hadn't been presented in terms of a popular genre? (horror/thriller)  Perhaps not, unfortunately...  This is quite a haunting work, and I found myself liking it as a film even while regretting that we don't see as many positive portrayals of giftedness as we should.",1394928000,,2640,4.874720357941834

You never see the kid do anything wrong - you just know there's something wrong with him personally.  He asks odd questions and stares blankly at the perfectly awkward times.  His mother (Vera Farmiga) was apparently a mess with sever post-partum depression after she had him and clearly never quite recovered since the new baby brings her fears back to surface full storm.  The boy is a bit of a prodigy (which is bizzare enough to most of us), but he's not even cheerful or braggadocious about it as most Amadeus types would be.  He's just blank. He's a sociopath with a genius I.Q. at the age of 9 or 10.,and you get the feeling that this kid is not acting. Brilliant!!
The father (Sam Rockwell) tries to be good..just to constantly do the right thing for everyone.  This is thwarted by the little boy who seems jealous of the baby...or maybe it's that he's just bad. I couldn't tell until the end.  I just knew that the boy who played this part (who's surprisingly handsome by now) is the creepiest kid I've ever watched on screen WITHOUT having to make ""evil eyes"" or ""evil little boy faces"".

While I adore a good psychological thriller, I did not find Joshua to have an original, mind-bending plot as much as it seemed to be a frankenstein movie that took bits and pieces from other similar films. It's not awful it's just not great. The slow pace will frustrate those who enjoy the quick-moving thriller so popular today. That didn't bother me. But I never felt like it paid off in the end. As an actress, I like Vera Farmega, however in this role, her character's irrational behavior was more irritating than interesting. They hint at her mental state but we never really find out if her issues were merely post-partum or something more? Was Joshua a true sociopath, born without empathy? Or was he just an extremely intelligent child that never felt he belonged with his family who later became overwrought with jealousy after his sister's birth and was driven to fits of rage?

3012571,3,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is a fantastic movie... for the final 30 minutes.  The first half is total nonstop disappointment involving such a ridiculously slow-moving pace that the film is almost a chore to watch.

However the movie does a fantastic job making viewers wonder who really *is* the bad person- the mother who doesn't care about/flat out ignores her older son Joshua after the birth of her baby daughter, dislikes and disapproves when the grandmother comes over and tries to change the family's religious beliefs therefore making Joshua change his outlook on life, and just doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on that all important thing called motherhood.  An unfit/uncaring mother basically.

Or is Joshua (the son) the bad person?  He's the one who seems really cold-hearted and unaware of his actions.  He seems willing to learn just as frequently as he does disagreeing and going against his parents wishes whenever he can despite how much the mother and father try to stop it from happening.

The movie does a pretty good job during the second half making us wonder if Joshua really is responsible for the horrible things that seem to happen whenever he's around therefore leading us to conclude that the boy has mental issues, however the first hour and 10 minutes is so flat out *boring* with hardly any suspense or excitement whatsoever that the movie honestly can't be saved.  What happens during the first half you're probably wondering?  The boy learns piano, tries to adapt to a world with a new sibling, and goes out to museums with his grandmother learning about religion (actually, more like teaching his grandmother about religion).  Nothing really enticing occurs during this lengthy period of time so it feels like useless storytelling.

I think what bothers me the most is the mother.  She does absolutely nothing to convince me she's mature or responsible enough to handle taking care of a child, let alone a children and a baby.  The father... well, it's best not to spoil his involvement with Joshua.  It's surprising to say the least.  I'm referring to the final 10 minutes.  Did NOT see that one coming.

Overall, a slow first half doesn't really warrant a viewing in this case I'm afraid.  30 minutes of excitement and 70 minutes of boredom isn't a good ratio at all.",1358812800,,2284,4.857881136950905

The mother (Abby) is the worst a child can have! she constantly cries and cries and then screams and then throw things at the husband! She doesn't pay attention to the way her son speaks, the books he reads or even the way he dresses himself. But she's only concerns about him NOT going to church! If I had a son, I would encourage him to act his own age and I won't ignore it! if that's not enough of her, she left a videotape of herself (which Joshua will find later) where she was yelling and crying while taking care of Joshua when he was a baby...who would ever videotape himself crying and leave it in the house...that's stupid and disgusting... is that to make her child feel unwanted and abused?!! This is the mother, FAILURE and PAIN IN THE A**

The husband on the other hand, is nothing but a pervert child...he will go down on his wife expecting sex while she looks sick like a dog. He will run down the street barefoot and cry hysterically over his dead dog but wouldn't give a rat A** when his mother is murdered! And wait, when Abby called his mother F****** B**** and kicked her out twice, he was sitting there watching his mother getting humiliated. Ok, this is Joshua's father, some disgusting ungrown man!!!

The grandma (Abby mother in law) played the country lady and concerned Christian mother, who will come over to take care of her son's family when Abby cut her foot and yes she will take care of everyone including Abby ( who would later kick her out). but again she is another bad influence on the child, she will teach him the negative/violent side of the religion but not love or compassion.

The social worker is just another awkward part of the movie, she will assume that the child is getting abused because of his drawing, and the father is the abuser, yet she will still leave the child with his abusing father.

Joshua is the brilliant, smart and articulate boy but his character is just not convincing...The
movie wanted to demonstrate the child as Evil...But sorry, the child WAS NOT BORN EVIL...he only started acting out after his sister birth so all he needs is just attention. The boy was playing soccer before, he wasn't interesting in ""evil ancient Egyptian books"" before, he wasn't killing people before...it all happened after his sister birth...So, in my opinion, he is NOT evil, or sociopath...he's more like a victim of his dysfunctional family. My last point, I have never seen any child who (all of a sudden) start killing people out of jealousy but still he wasn't born evil that's why the whole thing is contradicting and confusing",1338768000,,2851,4.58235294117647
3012589,1,B000Y7U982,"I really wanted to like this movie but it is hard to ignore all the flaws. There were far too many holes in the plot. There were mention of ghosts and Egyptian Gods when clearly the movie was gonna lead to neither. It was like the director or writer or whoever was trying to keep us guessing about the origin of the boy's behavior and they just didn't pull it off. The parents just seemed to lack good ole common sense. At the end there were so many unanswered questions. The story comes off as incomplete. I'm not gonna go into too much detail. I was just disappointed.

 I believe the movie could've been way better had the story been filled out more. A lot just didn't make sense, for example when the dad tells the uncle he suspects something is wrong with Joshua. The uncle laughs and tells the dad he's the one who needs help when just days before he had admitted very casually that his family has a history of mental illness. Or how the dad could've proven his point with a very strong piece of evidence he found but he never uses it. I think Vera Famiga is a great actress but her character was left to just go crazy. That's it.

 There is a lot of yelling and raging in the movie and a huge over reaction to a child attending a Christian meeting when the parents had stated earlier his preference of religion was his choice. Especially since one parent is supposedly Christian. It just doesn't make sense. Another example, one day the dad is looking at a female co-worker and pornography because he supposedly isn't getting enough affection at home then when he gets his affection he is later seen flirting it up with this same girl while leaving his clearly unstable wife at home with his 2 kids. Or when the social worker leaves Joshua in the care of his father though she suspects abuse. It's character actions like this that just lead to a lot of confusion.

One minute you think you know where the movie's going then it flip flops.

The story--what little there is--centers around the parents of Joshua, a supposedly brilliant nine-year-old devil-child, and how everything basically goes to hell once Joshua's baby sister is born.  OK, stop.  Let's take this one step at a time.

How do we know that Joshua is brilliant?  Um... because he talks about what he learned in school and wears his shirts buttoned all the way up to the top.

How do we know he's evil?  Well, because he looks hard at things and doesn't blink.

But more importantly, WHY is he evil?  In other words, why is he trying to drive his poor parents nuts?  Well... the filmmakers would like us to believe that it's because he's jealous of the attention his baby sister gets.

One problem: his parents are clearly making a strong effort to shower him with attention, affection, and encouragement, so the emotional catalyst just isn't there.  Nor do we have any real clue as to whether Joshua is inherently sadistic, or just acting out of desperation.

Likewise, the various ""twists"" aren't really twists at all, since this movie ends pretty much exactly the way you think it would--but, oddly, in a much less plausible way.

About three-fourths of the way through this stumbling, seemingly made-for-TV film, the filmmakers try to trick us by implying that someone/something else is the villain--as though the audience were just that stupid!  But they take this too far, meaning the villain COULDN'T be the villain after all!  In other words, the filmmakers contradict themselves.

Spoiler warning: there's no way Joshua could be at fault for everything that happened, since it's never addressed if/how he could have tampered with his mom's medication (what, does he have a secret chemistry lab somewhere that he also uses to poison animals?), nor is it addressed what he was doing to make his sister cry all the time.  If he was just wandering into her room all the time and shaking her awake, wouldn't the parents eventually catch him?  Why would she keep crying in the afternoons?  And come to think of it, what parents keep their crying newborn in a separate room down the hall?

This movie also asks us to make some huge leaps of faith, like: 1) no one else saw Joshua push a certain character down the stairs of a crowded public place and kill her... in the middle of the afternoon! 2) that the father, upon discovering a very disturbing home movie filmed by his son, showed it to... absolutely no one! 3) that child psychologists see a child scribble a scary picture and IMMEDIATELY conclude that a child has definitely been abused (hey, I drew scary pictures, too; I just thought they were cool!), and finally, 4) that a nine-year-old boy sitting at a piano and singing a god-awful adult contemporary song is scary... well, actually, that IS pretty horrifying!",1213488000,13,3229,4.822141560798548
3012644,3,B000Y7U982,"I definitely wouldn't call this movie ""suspenseful"".  And the ending didn't ""keep me guessing"".  The basic gist of the movie is a tried-and-true mantra: little kids can be extremely creepy.  Just like other movies with this schematic (Children of the Corn, 6th Sense), we are led to believe that the little ones we love just might be evil.  There are no monsters or devils or cool special effects in this movie.  In fact, there isn't really any elusion to anything paranormal, which makes this even creepier.  Basically, it's just about a really bad (and smart) kid who attempts to ruin everybody's life.  I thought that the ending really lacked any type of closure, and the boy's character would have been better with a little building of anger instead of the good-one-day-bad-the-next development.  On the plus side, it does have a few genuinely freaky scenes (the boy using the video camera).

I wanted to like it because it was supposed to be a different type of horror movie, but I felt like I was constantly waiting for something to happen and few things did. Although it attempts to be intellectual and psychological, it is just slow and disjointed.  Kudos to Ratliff for wanting to make an unconventional horror film, but I do not think it was successful.

Random vomiting, sudden mood swings and anger from all of the characters, and bizarre details made this movie feel incomplete, not haunting.  Why show Brad at work?  Why include ghosts?  Why reveal some of Joshua's bad nature, but then attempt to make it an ambiguous film where you are supposed to guess?  Why have the characters discover some truth, only to not use it to their advantage against Joshua?  Why would a child psychologist leave an abused child under sole supervision of the abuser?

In its attempt to be smart, it was sloppy.  This film desperately wants to be the secular, Machiavellian ""Omen.""  Intelligence is evil, not creatures possessed by demons from hell--too pass&eacute;.  Instead, every one is mentally unstable and has numerous problems.  No one has a good grasp of religion, just extremes.  Although more psychological than gory, it brought the viewer into an analytical mindset and then made glaring mistakes that you cannot ignore.

The kid is intelligent, and there is a subtext about him despising his yuppie parents and preferring chaos and destruction to the anomie and hypocrisy that his parents have embraced. A key line, delivered early in the movie, has the parents say to each other, (paraphrase): These people we hang out with are superficial, and we are part of their crowd. Initially, upon a superficial viewing, one will find oneself sympathizing totally with the (very attractive) parents: Vera Farmiga was the female lead in ""The Departed,"" which was thrilling, and Sam Rockwell is known from Charlie's Angels and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" an interesting, if fictive, work [despite the authors claim that it is a memoir] and is a likable and pleasant presence.

It is mystifying that an above-average genre film would put forth such a weak effort in closing--the mother's milk of horror movies.

Throughout the course of the film, the family dog, guinea pig and a God-fearing, sexagenarian grandmother. Bad luck seems to follow Joshua. His mother has a downward-spiral toward mental illness, and guess who tinkers with the medication? A child psychologist believes he is being abused, bruising and eery drawings as not-so-subtle clues that can be found in any psychology text--of which Joshua has unlimited accesss.

Of course, no one suspects the child until it is too late, and even then only his father, who was seen beating the child in a public park.

You never really see him doing things because it is all suggested.  It is left up to you to connect the dots but it is pretty obvious who is being the evil actions.  The child who played Joshua fit the role too. He is a normal looking kid but through his actions he begins to look creepier and creepier.  Its good that they did not make him up to look like a weirdo kid because it would be too over-the-top and obvious.  I will not spoil the plot but the intensity of the film really grabs you as things begin to fall apart in Joshua's home.

The second half of the movie goes in all sorts of different directions.  The ending leaves more questions than you started with.  My daughter, who is 19, loves all these types of movies and is very forgiving of ones that are not all that good, and she thought this was terrible.

This movie deals with a more creepily contained version of such a problem. The danger isn't quite as blatant or as aggressively relentless as seen on some of the talk shows. But its subtlety makes it all the more chilling.

There are a few obvious cinematic borrowings from other famous suspense films here. For example, you might, at a few points, be reminded of Damien's targeted, juggernaut cycling scene in ""The Omen."" Then there is a twist on the famous ""Potemkin"" stairway/baby carriage scene.

But unlike those films, ""Joshua"" strives for and achieves the more low-key disquiet of mundane reality. And it is made all the more disturbingly realistic by the fact that not only Joshua, but all the family members are shown with at least thread-line cracks running through their personalities.

Sam Rockwell gives perhaps one of his best performances as a father who can do nothing but watch his family fall apart while some, slip into insanity. Joshua (the movie) has a very slow and deliberate pacing that constantly builds towards the end of the film. This is a clever and well thought out flick that coasted through theaters and onto DVD but none the less is more then worth the price of a rental to check out.

The whole way through we are treated to a mystery of sorts: What is UP with this KID?! It fans across all psychological and horror movie types in it's presentation to keep you wondering whether the kid is possessed, demonic or just plain psychotic, or maybe the kid is really ok and there is something else going on. I really enjoy being led on a rollercoaster ride that doesn't blatantly blast me in the face with all that's really happening. In other words, I enjoy being tested rather than force fed. That this movie is of the independent genre also is commendable. Watch the movie more than once to catch the clues of Joshua learning the weaknesses of those around him and deviously orchestrating situations that couldn't possibly be believed to come from a boy so well mannered and cerebral. Those who ""just didn't get"" this movie were probably looking for jack in the box, seat of the pants zapping horror and if that is what you really want, look elsewhere because this is another of the few thinking person thrillers that filmmakers like Hitchcock would have loved. Acting was far above the norm even for this type of movie; you really get what these characters are going through with the fantastic REAL performances. The direction teeters between great and often brilliant as does the writing. If you want to be mildly entertained, see the latest slasher film.

After watching it, I have no idea which of those things it's about.  In its quest to be intriguingly ambiguous, the movie just winds up as vague.  I found absolutely nothing in it to recommend it to anyone for any reason.  It's not creepy enough for horror fans, it's not thrilling or mysterious enough for thriller/mystery fans and since Sam Rockwell is terribly mis-cast as the father in this film, it's not even something I'd tell his fans to watch.

Shortly after Lily arrives home, a dark side of prodigy son Joshua slowly begins to reveal itself.

A couple of Manhattan yuppies are expecting their second child.  Their first child doesn't react to well to the presence of baby sister - in fact he goes Damien on the entire family.

Brad Cairn (Sam Rockwell) is a young stockbroker and seems to be in the money since the family lives in a nice Manhattan apartment.  His wife Abby (Vera Farmiga) is expecting their second child and give birth to a little girl.  The Cairn's already have a son named Joshua (Jacob Kogan).

He appears to be an extremely intelligent and attends a private school where he wears a blazer and a tie as a uniform.  He also plays piano with his favorite Ned (Dallas Roberts).  His mother is not having a good time with the birth of child number two and seems to be having postpartum depression.  Brad is busy trying to get some big deals at work so he doesn't seem to notice at first that Joshua is acting strangely to the arrival of his little sister.  In fact, he seems to be making some sort of devious plans for baby sister and also using mom's depression to his advantage (and even accentuates it).

Suddenly dad begins to have to handle mom's increasing insanity and starts notice that Joshua has plans that he's working on behind the scenes - and they're not plans that will have a happy ending.

Joshua definitely brings to mind another demonic lad - Damien from Omen (with a pinch of Rosemary's Baby thrown in for good measure).  In fact, the cover basically screams that.  However this naughty boy doesn't have an evil, supernatural entity that fathered him.  What we do have is an intelligent boy but he's also cunning and appears to be without conscious.

Young Jacob Kogan does a decent job at portraying the role, but the adults also have been well cast as well.  Sam Rockwell is more know for his comedic roles but he does well as the harried father who has to deal with his wife's depression and then learns that his young son is plotting something devious.

Vera Farmiga is also good, but has to lose her mind and this can be a bit grating, as we want her to come out of her funk.  What doesn't really jibe is the reason behind his devilish ways.  It doesn't really have the payoff that we might expect, but in a child's size view of the world it might make perfect sense.

Soon to join their family is little Lilly, whose birth would seem to strengthen the family, but instead it brings up feelings in little Joshua.  Or rather, it brings up the LACK of feelings in this singularly creepy child.

JOSHUA isn't quite a horror movie...nothing supernatural happens.  What it does, however, is create a situation in which the post-partum depression (bordering on psychosis) of the mother collides with the sociopathic nature of her intelligent but emotionless son.

Joshua is obsessed with ancient Egyptian culture, particularly the methods they had for embalming and preserving their dead.  Joshua is also prone to making odd remarks out of the blue, such as ""You don't have to love me, dad.  There's no law.""  Joshua IS loved, especially by his dad...but he can't feel it, nor can he share it.  He imitates the actions of others, in an effort to fit in.  One early creepy scene has Joshua performing at a school piano recital.  We've seen him play in several earlier scenes, and we know he's brilliant.  But on stage, he imitates the horrible efforts of his peers, and plays a horrible version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" instead of Bartok.

We might think that he's simply jealous of his new sister...but he appears to be jealous of other people having emotions.  As his schemes begin to be furthered, his mother unravels and his perplexed father becomes more and more stressed about not keeping his family together.

Farmiga, a very interesting looking actress, is not given much to do beyond going steadily nuts.  Rockwell, on the other hand, plays a highly successful man who also appears to be a decent husband and doting father.  A flawed but very good guy.  An appeaser.  But when the truth of who, or what, his son is sinks in...Rockwell has some unusual reactions.  In fact, his actions in the final scenes of the film don't seem to flow from the character we knew before.  He makes a huge leap in understanding his troubling kid, but then does various ridiculous things with that knowledge.

JOSHUA is a slow-paced film...just barely interesting enough to keep watching in the early going.  As it becomes more clear what Joshua is, the film picks up...just in time to run into the unconvincing personality change in the father's character.  The film rushes to an ending, and while the final scene is effective...the ultimate feeling I was left with was ""eh, that didn't quite work.""

Rockwell is very good as the father...it is the script that betrays him.  Also, the film takes some needless digs at evangelical Christianity, in the depiction of Rockwell's mother as a kook.

So, while the film has its creepy moments and a good performance...it is a 60 minute story stretched over 106 minutes...thus slowed to a crawl and peppered with lazy writing.  I can't quite recommend it.",1201910400,4,3009,4.881656804733728

3246944,2,B000Y7U982,"(2.5 *'s) There's no doubt there's something familiar about Joshua (Jacob Kogan).  In opening scenes we see him at the piano performing songs for his Uncle Ned (Dallas Roberts) his mother, Abby (Vera Farmiga), and his father, Brad (Sam Rockwell).  His mother holds their newborn daughter in her arms as his uncle encourages him while he plays.  The family is happy about the new addition, but like many families, they try to give special attention to the first born, who is nine and practicing for a school recital.  We soon realize in the absent monotone in Joshua's voice that something is indeed wrong.  At different points in the film, he asks his parents separately if they love him.

The film basically goes forward in chronological order.  Captions show the development of the baby: (e.g. ...31 days, 47 days..., etc.), and we see that the infant is more demanding than most.  At one point, the baby has cried for five days straight, and Abby is under medication.  Much of the movie tries to find a solution for the unraveling mother and a baby that no one seems to have a handle on.  Just around the corner during the late night awakenings is Joshua, who startles mother, dad, and audience.  Dad is losing footing at work where his boss, Chester, is seeing everything fall apart.  It doesn't help Brad that a series of crises send him home when the prospects at work seem so bleak.

To demonstrate Joshua's familiarity, in one scene he is staring vacantly just outside the doorway.  In the other room his parents are trying to calm their little one as if she had a colic.  The whole scene had an uncanny resemblance to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-25th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/079073804X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;when the mother is making a long-distance call. Then, at a piano reception in the living room, Joshua lets out some bodily fluids on the floor.  Perhaps not the same fluids as a similar scene, but fluids just the same, and both movies suggest there's more than nerves working in the young child's life.

At one point at the breakfast table, Joshua announces that someone has died in their house.  The parents are incredulous, but not yet alarmed by this peculiar statement.  Flashing forward, there's a scene with a discovery about Joshua's drawings, and in both cases it's more than a little reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>.  He's even attending a private school and wearing a suit and tie at the table.

The filmmakers seemed to center their movie around a theme and used elements of other movies as its primary plot thrust.  Brad shows some genuine affection for his first born son.  He's a loving and caring father, but in one scene at work he's telling an ethnic joke that has all but been outlawed nowadays.  The development is startling--too deliberate to be a deleted scene.  Also, the family is mixed:  Abby is Jewish and Brad is Christian.  As a subplot, Brad's mother, Hazel (Celia Watson, playing a minor variation of her role in 'Junebug') is a born-again Christian.  She takes Joshua to a revival prayer service without either parent's permission.  Much like 'All in the Family' when Archie baptizes little Joey without their parents' consent, Brad and Abby are upset, having arranged to allow the child's faith to be nurtured their own way.

There are four points I admire about 'Joshua'.  One is that despite the dead ringer elements of other movies (and here I must include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000EYK4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Son/dp/B00013RC7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Son</a>&nbsp;to the list) the movie managed to instill a sense of suspense.  Also, the acting is either genuine to genuinely good.  Vera Farmiga is perhaps the best in the show, reaffirming what she's been able to do in the past.  Jacob Kogan is no Hailey Joel Osment or Abigail Breslin, but he's mostly a believable child actor nonetheless.  The supporting cast, including Rockwell and Weston, keep it real throughout.  Thirdly, there are so many more developments that take place that I haven't mentioned.  There are other scenes that definitely keep one's interest.  The other asset is that the resolution is totally unpredictable.

If the film hadn't been so derivative, I would have given the movie three and a half stars.  Nowadays it is seldom that you find any film that doesn't have some elements from other movies, but these resemblances were so uncanny, it separated the difference between a film that borrows and one that's cut-and-paste*.

Indeed, the title character bears more than a passing resemblance, and a few scenes are staged as neat little hommages to the ""evil demonic child"" school of filmmaking.

But the demon here is no supernatural creation.  He evolves before your very eyes in the person of a nine year old boy, who may have the roots of a personality disorder....or may be responding to the birth of a new child in the family and to postpartum depression suffered by his mother.  Whatever the reason, Joshua moves through (and ultimately, just moves) a story which stumbles a few times but more often than not leads the viewer down an unexpected path....and into a building dread which grows steadily throughout the film to a climax you're not likely to forget--on several levels, actually.  Prepare to have several of your fears played upon to great effect--even if you didn't think you were particularly afraid of them.  You may well find yourself saying aloud as you realize it: ""but....all of this actually happens....""

No big-name cast here, but by and large the acting is quite capable (the actor who portrays Joshua is especially riveting and incredibly subtle for a child), the writing might well have inspired jealousy from Alfred Hitchcock, and the camera is almost a character in the film itself, sliding around corners and down claustrophobic corridors in such a way that you half expect it to look over its shoulder at times.  The use of music at several points is extremely effective--it's worth sitting through the credits to let the story's final chill running down your spine sink in properly.

Come prepared to pay attention--and to encounter a few scenes that seem a bit uncertain.  But give this movie a chance, let it draw you in.  I can almost guarantee that it will not let go of you easily.",1199836800,4,1946,4.813813813813814
3246946,4,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is hauntingly beautiful in its music, cinematography and direction. It may not be an original concept, but it's well-done. It has its flaws though - it runs a bit longer than it should, and a main character vanishes halfway through.

3246947,4,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is about a young boy living in New York with his seemingly perfect
parents.  He is an accomplished piano player, and rejects sports, which
is somewhat disappointing to his father.  He is always perfectly groomed,
and highly intellectual.  Early on, however, it is clear that there is a
sinister side to Joshua, which becomes increasingly evident following the
birth of a little sister.  Side characters include the fathers parents,
who are Christian Fundamentalists, and Joshua's Uncle, (Mom's brother).
Joshua's mother is suffering from post-partum depression and has symptoms
of schizophrenia, and his dad is trying to keep things together.  Slowly, bad things keep happening, which usually point to Joshua, though nobody
wants to acknowledge the possibility.  Does he want to eliminate his
sister?  His parents?  The movie is increasingly tense and creepy, and
the climax is interesting, to say the least.  The film is overall less
satisfying than the original ""Bad Seed"" with Patty McCormack, probably
because Joshua is not portrayed quite as charming and likable when not
in distress or under suspicion.  Still, the film is well acted and keeps
you guessing and nervous.  Worth seeing if you like a psychological
thriller.",1199836800,3,1234,5.309278350515464
3246948,4,B000Y7U982,"""Joshua"" is set in New York city and focuses on a young family comprising of Brad and Abby Cairn [Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga], who seem to lead a charmed life. Brad has a well-paying job, they live in a comfortable city apartment, and they have a 9-year-old son, Joshua [Jacob Kogan] who is also a gifted pianist. There is also a new baby, Lily who seems like a perfect child, quiet and lovable, but this seemingly perfect family portrait slowly unravels into a nightmarish horror as the family is plunged into one crisis after another.

It appears that harmless little Joshua, of the quiet and unassuming character, is not so benign after all. In fact, far from it - Lily's birth seems to be the catalyst that brings forth his psychopathic behavior [arguably simmering within him all along]. At first, the problems seem to have ordinary reasons - Abby seems unable to cope with the demands of motherhood [understandable given her history of depression and PPD], dad Brad seems to be the quintessential good guy, a supportive husband and dad trying to balance the demands of work and family, but the audience is never kept in the dark as to the sinister force behind the family's problems.

The acting was surprisingly good given that the main actors are not really well-known.  Brad Cairn [as played by Sam Rockwell] makes a convincing husband and father and is the proverbial good guy in a bad situation. Vera Farmiga is also believable as Abby Cairn, whose misery at being unable to cope with a fussy infant and the demands of being a wife and mother added to her battle with depression is very convincing indeed - except that you tend to wonder - why does she refuse to seek help [no nanny, housekeeper, or even family rule?]. This does stretch the credulity level a bit, but still works on-screen. There is a supportive brother Ned [Dallas Roberts] who is well-liked by all, yes, even by Joshua. Too bad he doesn't appear in too many scenes. There is the zealous Christian grandmother [Celia Weston] and of course Joshua himself, played ably by Jacob Kogan. His Joshua is well-groomed at all times [nary a hair out of place],and projects a quiet sort of malevolence that permeates the scenes he appears in, and even when he isn't there, the score and sets add to the sinister atmosphere.

For fans of psychological horror, Joshua is very much reminiscent of classics like The Bad Seed [remember Rhoda?], and The Other, even The Good Son, and if you haven't seen those movies, you might want to check them out. All of them are highly atmospheric and thought-provoking. As for Joshua, it is a well-paced psychological thriller that is worth a few squirms, at least!",1199836800,36,2671,4.725321888412017

This film is not filled with gore, or in-your-face horror.  I find it all the more disturbing, because everything is done in a subtle fashion, making the story very believable.  The child actor that portrays Joshua, is truely amazing, he's not over-the-top, but very effective.  When he starts playing the piano and singing at the end of the film, I was truely creeped out.

I had been putting off watching it for quite a while because I really wasn't sure where it was going. I know some other reviewers mention that it was somewhat the mothers fault from postpartum depression that caused her son to turn out the way he did but I wholeheartedly believe some kids are just born sh*****. He is a narcissistic self serving little prick - in my personal opinion.

If you are looking for a neat little thriller - i don't want to call it a psychological thriller which is how it was advertised to me because I think you can figure out quite early what is going on - this is a good movie to spend some time on.

3247046,4,B000Y7U982,"I was less interested in the horror aspects of the film (although I find that PG-13 level thrillers can be fun) than in the characterization of giftedness.  As with countless films, people's fear of ""evil genius"" gets exploited (and reinforced) yet again.  But in this case, there was a lot of extra care taken in providing a more creditable presentation.  The film turned out to be just as good as I'd been hoping for, in which the horror elements actually become existential - - the title character, and some surprisingly strong additional characters, all question in different ways what leads people to care for each other, and whether such feelings and compulsions are defensible and worthwhile.  Since this is obviously a very unsettling line of thought, treating it in terms of a thriller is one tangent that allows such a subject to be explored in a new manner.  The bases for human trust are shown as destabilized when a youngster who one would normally think is too helpless and innocent to harm anyone turns out instead to be capable of dedicated efforts to out-think those around him.  One interesting problem is that the chracter ***is*** too young to understand that his family are indeed far better people, despite their flaws, than most strangers would be.  If Joshua had been more fully exposed to the heartlessness of strangers, he might have been more appreciative and less eager to rile things up by exploring dark things.  For all that we know, the origin of his feelings of this type had started with the birth of a sibling, at the start of the film.  The piano rhapsody on ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" (originally a theme by Mozart - a fact that Joshua would know even if most adults wouldn't) was BRILLIANT!  It suggests that the problem may have partially been rooted in an inability for others to sufficiently relate to and engage Joshua's genius, causing it to go into warped directions that I think would untimately be self-destructive.  Instead of lurid horror, what we have here is actually a very solid character-based drama.  I cannot fully endorse the immoral aspects within the plot, but for adult viewers, I feel that this is a solid and challenging work that pushes strongly at the limitations that the horror/thriller genre normally tends to impose.  And realistically, would this work have made it to video for widespread viewing if it hadn't been presented in terms of a popular genre? (horror/thriller)  Perhaps not, unfortunately...  This is quite a haunting work, and I found myself liking it as a film even while regretting that we don't see as many positive portrayals of giftedness as we should.",1394928000,,2640,4.874720357941834

You never see the kid do anything wrong - you just know there's something wrong with him personally.  He asks odd questions and stares blankly at the perfectly awkward times.  His mother (Vera Farmiga) was apparently a mess with sever post-partum depression after she had him and clearly never quite recovered since the new baby brings her fears back to surface full storm.  The boy is a bit of a prodigy (which is bizzare enough to most of us), but he's not even cheerful or braggadocious about it as most Amadeus types would be.  He's just blank. He's a sociopath with a genius I.Q. at the age of 9 or 10.,and you get the feeling that this kid is not acting. Brilliant!!
The father (Sam Rockwell) tries to be good..just to constantly do the right thing for everyone.  This is thwarted by the little boy who seems jealous of the baby...or maybe it's that he's just bad.

I just knew that the boy who played this part (who's surprisingly handsome by now) is the creepiest kid I've ever watched on screen WITHOUT having to make ""evil eyes"" or ""evil little boy faces"".

It is an incredibly slow paced movie and the characters just aren't very interesting including the disturbed boy.  The Good Son was a way better movie about an evil boy.  It is supposed to keep you guessing who actually is the bad person but I never seriously cared and fell asleep in the middle somewhere then awoke more towards the end.

While I adore a good psychological thriller, I did not find Joshua to have an original, mind-bending plot as much as it seemed to be a frankenstein movie that took bits and pieces from other similar films. It's not awful it's just not great. The slow pace will frustrate those who enjoy the quick-moving thriller so popular today. That didn't bother me. But I never felt like it paid off in the end. As an actress, I like Vera Farmega, however in this role, her character's irrational behavior was more irritating than interesting. They hint at her mental state but we never really find out if her issues were merely post-partum or something more? Was Joshua a true sociopath, born without empathy? Or was he just an extremely intelligent child that never felt he belonged with his family who later became overwrought with jealousy after his sister's birth and was driven to fits of rage?

3247068,3,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is a fantastic movie... for the final 30 minutes.  The first half is total nonstop disappointment involving such a ridiculously slow-moving pace that the film is almost a chore to watch.

However the movie does a fantastic job making viewers wonder who really *is* the bad person- the mother who doesn't care about/flat out ignores her older son Joshua after the birth of her baby daughter, dislikes and disapproves when the grandmother comes over and tries to change the family's religious beliefs therefore making Joshua change his outlook on life, and just doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on that all important thing called motherhood.  An unfit/uncaring mother basically.

Or is Joshua (the son) the bad person?  He's the one who seems really cold-hearted and unaware of his actions.  He seems willing to learn just as frequently as he does disagreeing and going against his parents wishes whenever he can despite how much the mother and father try to stop it from happening.

The movie does a pretty good job during the second half making us wonder if Joshua really is responsible for the horrible things that seem to happen whenever he's around therefore leading us to conclude that the boy has mental issues, however the first hour and 10 minutes is so flat out *boring* with hardly any suspense or excitement whatsoever that the movie honestly can't be saved.  What happens during the first half you're probably wondering?  The boy learns piano, tries to adapt to a world with a new sibling, and goes out to museums with his grandmother learning about religion (actually, more like teaching his grandmother about religion).  Nothing really enticing occurs during this lengthy period of time so it feels like useless storytelling.

I think what bothers me the most is the mother.  She does absolutely nothing to convince me she's mature or responsible enough to handle taking care of a child, let alone a children and a baby.  The father... well, it's best not to spoil his involvement with Joshua.  It's surprising to say the least.  I'm referring to the final 10 minutes.  Did NOT see that one coming.

Overall, a slow first half doesn't really warrant a viewing in this case I'm afraid.  30 minutes of excitement and 70 minutes of boredom isn't a good ratio at all.",1358812800,,2284,4.857881136950905

The mother (Abby) is the worst a child can have! she constantly cries and cries and then screams and then throw things at the husband! She doesn't pay attention to the way her son speaks, the books he reads or even the way he dresses himself. But she's only concerns about him NOT going to church! If I had a son, I would encourage him to act his own age and I won't ignore it! if that's not enough of her, she left a videotape of herself (which Joshua will find later) where she was yelling and crying while taking care of Joshua when he was a baby...who would ever videotape himself crying and leave it in the house...that's stupid and disgusting... is that to make her child feel unwanted and abused?!! This is the mother, FAILURE and PAIN IN THE A**

The husband on the other hand, is nothing but a pervert child...he will go down on his wife expecting sex while she looks sick like a dog. He will run down the street barefoot and cry hysterically over his dead dog but wouldn't give a rat A** when his mother is murdered! And wait, when Abby called his mother F****** B**** and kicked her out twice, he was sitting there watching his mother getting humiliated. Ok, this is Joshua's father, some disgusting ungrown man!!!

The grandma (Abby mother in law) played the country lady and concerned Christian mother, who will come over to take care of her son's family when Abby cut her foot and yes she will take care of everyone including Abby ( who would later kick her out). but again she is another bad influence on the child, she will teach him the negative/violent side of the religion but not love or compassion.

The social worker is just another awkward part of the movie, she will assume that the child is getting abused because of his drawing, and the father is the abuser, yet she will still leave the child with his abusing father.

Joshua is the brilliant, smart and articulate boy but his character is just not convincing...The
movie wanted to demonstrate the child as Evil...But sorry, the child WAS NOT BORN EVIL...he only started acting out after his sister birth so all he needs is just attention. The boy was playing soccer before, he wasn't interesting in ""evil ancient Egyptian books"" before, he wasn't killing people before...it all happened after his sister birth...So, in my opinion, he is NOT evil, or sociopath...he's more like a victim of his dysfunctional family. My last point, I have never seen any child who (all of a sudden) start killing people out of jealousy but still he wasn't born evil that's why the whole thing is contradicting and confusing",1338768000,,2851,4.58235294117647
3247086,1,B000Y7U982,"I really wanted to like this movie but it is hard to ignore all the flaws. There were far too many holes in the plot. There were mention of ghosts and Egyptian Gods when clearly the movie was gonna lead to neither. It was like the director or writer or whoever was trying to keep us guessing about the origin of the boy's behavior and they just didn't pull it off. The parents just seemed to lack good ole common sense. At the end there were so many unanswered questions. The story comes off as incomplete. I'm not gonna go into too much detail. I was just disappointed.

 I believe the movie could've been way better had the story been filled out more. A lot just didn't make sense, for example when the dad tells the uncle he suspects something is wrong with Joshua. The uncle laughs and tells the dad he's the one who needs help when just days before he had admitted very casually that his family has a history of mental illness. Or how the dad could've proven his point with a very strong piece of evidence he found but he never uses it. I think Vera Famiga is a great actress but her character was left to just go crazy. That's it.

 There is a lot of yelling and raging in the movie and a huge over reaction to a child attending a Christian meeting when the parents had stated earlier his preference of religion was his choice. Especially since one parent is supposedly Christian. It just doesn't make sense. Another example, one day the dad is looking at a female co-worker and pornography because he supposedly isn't getting enough affection at home then when he gets his affection he is later seen flirting it up with this same girl while leaving his clearly unstable wife at home with his 2 kids. Or when the social worker leaves Joshua in the care of his father though she suspects abuse. It's character actions like this that just lead to a lot of confusion.

One minute you think you know where the movie's going then it flip flops.

3247140,1,B000Y7U982,"If you think ""Joshua"" is a horror movie, I suggest you always carry a spare pair of trousers with you in case you accidentally look down and see your own shadow.  This movie (hilariously described as ""Hitchcockian"") has no idea what it wants to do--except be scary, which director/writer George Ratliff and co-writer David Gilbert pursue with all the fumbling gusto of screaming teenage fans waiting in line for a pop concert.

The story--what little there is--centers around the parents of Joshua, a supposedly brilliant nine-year-old devil-child, and how everything basically goes to hell once Joshua's baby sister is born.  OK, stop.  Let's take this one step at a time.

How do we know that Joshua is brilliant?  Um... because he talks about what he learned in school and wears his shirts buttoned all the way up to the top.

How do we know he's evil?  Well, because he looks hard at things and doesn't blink.

But more importantly, WHY is he evil?  In other words, why is he trying to drive his poor parents nuts?  Well... the filmmakers would like us to believe that it's because he's jealous of the attention his baby sister gets.

One problem: his parents are clearly making a strong effort to shower him with attention, affection, and encouragement, so the emotional catalyst just isn't there.  Nor do we have any real clue as to whether Joshua is inherently sadistic, or just acting out of desperation.

Likewise, the various ""twists"" aren't really twists at all, since this movie ends pretty much exactly the way you think it would--but, oddly, in a much less plausible way.

About three-fourths of the way through this stumbling, seemingly made-for-TV film, the filmmakers try to trick us by implying that someone/something else is the villain--as though the audience were just that stupid!  But they take this too far, meaning the villain COULDN'T be the villain after all!  In other words, the filmmakers contradict themselves.

Spoiler warning: there's no way Joshua could be at fault for everything that happened, since it's never addressed if/how he could have tampered with his mom's medication (what, does he have a secret chemistry lab somewhere that he also uses to poison animals?), nor is it addressed what he was doing to make his sister cry all the time.  If he was just wandering into her room all the time and shaking her awake, wouldn't the parents eventually catch him?  Why would she keep crying in the afternoons?  And come to think of it, what parents keep their crying newborn in a separate room down the hall?

This movie also asks us to make some huge leaps of faith, like: 1) no one else saw Joshua push a certain character down the stairs of a crowded public place and kill her... in the middle of the afternoon! 2) that the father, upon discovering a very disturbing home movie filmed by his son, showed it to... absolutely no one! 3) that child psychologists see a child scribble a scary picture and IMMEDIATELY conclude that a child has definitely been abused (hey, I drew scary pictures, too; I just thought they were cool!), and finally, 4) that a nine-year-old boy sitting at a piano and singing a god-awful adult contemporary song is scary... well, actually, that IS pretty horrifying!",1213488000,13,3229,4.822141560798548
3247141,3,B000Y7U982,"I definitely wouldn't call this movie ""suspenseful"".  And the ending didn't ""keep me guessing"".  The basic gist of the movie is a tried-and-true mantra: little kids can be extremely creepy.  Just like other movies with this schematic (Children of the Corn, 6th Sense), we are led to believe that the little ones we love just might be evil.  There are no monsters or devils or cool special effects in this movie.  In fact, there isn't really any elusion to anything paranormal, which makes this even creepier.  Basically, it's just about a really bad (and smart) kid who attempts to ruin everybody's life.  I thought that the ending really lacked any type of closure, and the boy's character would have been better with a little building of anger instead of the good-one-day-bad-the-next development.  On the plus side, it does have a few genuinely freaky scenes (the boy using the video camera).

3247142,2,B000Y7U982,"This movie is a conundrum.  I do not really know what to say about it.  It was creepy and ambiguous.  Very few details are clarified for the audience.  I wanted to like it because it was supposed to be a different type of horror movie, but I felt like I was constantly waiting for something to happen and few things did. Although it attempts to be intellectual and psychological, it is just slow and disjointed.  Kudos to Ratliff for wanting to make an unconventional horror film, but I do not think it was successful.

Random vomiting, sudden mood swings and anger from all of the characters, and bizarre details made this movie feel incomplete, not haunting.  Why show Brad at work?  Why include ghosts?  Why reveal some of Joshua's bad nature, but then attempt to make it an ambiguous film where you are supposed to guess?  Why have the characters discover some truth, only to not use it to their advantage against Joshua?  Why would a child psychologist leave an abused child under sole supervision of the abuser?

In its attempt to be smart, it was sloppy.  This film desperately wants to be the secular, Machiavellian ""Omen.""  Intelligence is evil, not creatures possessed by demons from hell--too pass&eacute;.  Instead, every one is mentally unstable and has numerous problems.  No one has a good grasp of religion, just extremes.  Although more psychological than gory, it brought the viewer into an analytical mindset and then made glaring mistakes that you cannot ignore.

The kid is intelligent, and there is a subtext about him despising his yuppie parents and preferring chaos and destruction to the anomie and hypocrisy that his parents have embraced. A key line, delivered early in the movie, has the parents say to each other, (paraphrase): These people we hang out with are superficial, and we are part of their crowd. Initially, upon a superficial viewing, one will find oneself sympathizing totally with the (very attractive) parents: Vera Farmiga was the female lead in ""The Departed,"" which was thrilling, and Sam Rockwell is known from Charlie's Angels and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" an interesting, if fictive, work [despite the authors claim that it is a memoir] and is a likable and pleasant presence.
  However, upon reflection, you realize that the kid's project of rebellion may, at least, be understandable, if not admirable.",1210896000,,929,5.145695364238411

It is mystifying that an above-average genre film would put forth such a weak effort in closing--the mother's milk of horror movies.

The story is based on Joshua, a quiet, solemn prodigy who reads college-level books, plays the piano like a pro and spends a bit too much time with animals and his colicky infant sister. Throughout the course of the film, the family dog, guinea pig and a God-fearing, sexagenarian grandmother. Bad luck seems to follow Joshua. His mother has a downward-spiral toward mental illness, and guess who tinkers with the medication? A child psychologist believes he is being abused, bruising and eery drawings as not-so-subtle clues that can be found in any psychology text--of which Joshua has unlimited accesss.

Of course, no one suspects the child until it is too late, and even then only his father, who was seen beating the child in a public park. The pacing is a bit slow, the mood appropriately somber, the ending as enigmatic as it is a letdown. The writers never bother to inform audiences whether Joshua's behavior is a result of the supernatural or sociopathy.

Not only is the movie a downer, it also is unable to truly find a genre or its own niche. It's the kind of movie that has unidentifiable characters and an air of absurdity about it, although it's only really an exaggeration of what undoubtedly does take place. At the end of the day, The Omen succeeds much better in the psychological thriller that describes evil children. Having said that, it also bears saying that all performances are outstanding, particularly those of Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga.",1209340800,2,667,4.7094017094017095
3247146,4,B000Y7U982,I found this movie very enjoyable.  There is a lot of suspense and moments of horror when you realize the horrible things that young Joshua is doing.  You never really see him doing things because it is all suggested.  It is left up to you to connect the dots but it is pretty obvious who is being the evil actions.  The child who played Joshua fit the role too. He is a normal looking kid but through his actions he begins to look creepier and creepier.  Its good that they did not make him up to look like a weirdo kid because it would be too over-the-top and obvious.  I will not spoil the plot but the intensity of the film really grabs you as things begin to fall apart in Joshua's home.  The performances of the entire cast are strong and believable and that helps to make this movie a good one to watch.,1208044800,,810,4.187096774193549

It starts out well with you questioning whether Joshua is a sociopath, abused child, or if the parents are the ones with the issues.  The second half of the movie goes in all sorts of different directions.  The ending leaves more questions than you started with.  My daughter, who is 19, loves all these types of movies and is very forgiving of ones that are not all that good, and she thought this was terrible.

3247148,4,B000Y7U982,"A lot of talk shows have recently been featuring the plight of parents under siege, afraid of their own children - parents who feel compelled to lock their bedroom doors at night. This movie deals with a more creepily contained version of such a problem. The danger isn't quite as blatant or as aggressively relentless as seen on some of the talk shows. But its subtlety makes it all the more chilling.

There are a few obvious cinematic borrowings from other famous suspense films here. For example, you might, at a few points, be reminded of Damien's targeted, juggernaut cycling scene in ""The Omen."" Then there is a twist on the famous ""Potemkin"" stairway/baby carriage scene.

But unlike those films, ""Joshua"" strives for and achieves the more low-key disquiet of mundane reality. And it is made all the more disturbingly realistic by the fact that not only Joshua, but all the family members are shown with at least thread-line cracks running through their personalities.

""Joshua"" is a well-written, well-acted must-see for all suspense movie fans, as well as for all students of family dynamics.",1206144000,15,1102,4.978260869565218

3247180,4,B000Y7U982,"This flick has been thoroughly summarized so I will skip that portion. Joshua is an overall good, creepy film. Sam Rockwell gives perhaps one of his best performances as a father who can do nothing but watch his family fall apart while some, slip into insanity. Joshua (the movie) has a very slow and deliberate pacing that constantly builds towards the end of the film. This is a clever and well thought out flick that coasted through theaters and onto DVD but none the less is more then worth the price of a rental to check out. Joshua also features a new, very good, Dave Matthews song during the end credits.",1204848000,10,612,4.5225225225225225
3247181,5,B000Y7U982,"Taking on the task of creating a movie about a sociopathic kid with a mom going through post partum depression after said mom gives birth to his sister is certainly a daunting one at least, and yet Joshua shines nonetheless. The whole way through we are treated to a mystery of sorts: What is UP with this KID?! It fans across all psychological and horror movie types in it's presentation to keep you wondering whether the kid is possessed, demonic or just plain psychotic, or maybe the kid is really ok and there is something else going on. I really enjoy being led on a rollercoaster ride that doesn't blatantly blast me in the face with all that's really happening. In other words, I enjoy being tested rather than force fed. That this movie is of the independent genre also is commendable. Watch the movie more than once to catch the clues of Joshua learning the weaknesses of those around him and deviously orchestrating situations that couldn't possibly be believed to come from a boy so well mannered and cerebral. Those who ""just didn't get"" this movie were probably looking for jack in the box, seat of the pants zapping horror and if that is what you really want, look elsewhere because this is another of the few thinking person thrillers that filmmakers like Hitchcock would have loved. Acting was far above the norm even for this type of movie; you really get what these characters are going through with the fantastic REAL performances. The direction teeters between great and often brilliant as does the writing. If you want to be mildly entertained, see the latest slasher film. If you instead want a terrific  experience of a movie throwback to a bygone Hollywood era, Joshua is your movie.",1203292800,3,1707,4.728187919463087
3247182,2,B000Y7U982,"In the special features interviews with the cast and crew, people keep saying that they wanted this movie, about how a family falls apart in the wake of a new baby's arrival, to be a source of discussion for the audience regarding what exactly the movie is it about.  Is it about a mother's hopeless battle with post-partum depression?  Is it about an evil child?  Is it about a father being manipulated by either his wife, his child or his Jesus-loving mother?

After watching it, I have no idea which of those things it's about.  In its quest to be intriguingly ambiguous, the movie just winds up as vague.  I found absolutely nothing in it to recommend it to anyone for any reason.  It's not creepy enough for horror fans, it's not thrilling or mysterious enough for thriller/mystery fans and since Sam Rockwell is terribly mis-cast as the father in this film, it's not even something I'd tell his fans to watch.

In the end, it's just a strange little movie that doesn't fit in anywhere.  If that's seriously what the writer/director George Ratliff wanted, then he succeeded, but I didn't succeed in enjoying the movie one bit.",1203033600,2,1131,4.671717171717172

3247186,3,B000Y7U982,"JOSHUA is the tale of Brad (Sam Rockwell) and Abby (Vera Farmiga) Cairn, perfect Manhattan parents in a perfect Manhattan apartment whose perfect life begins to crack after the birth of their second child Lily.  Shortly after Lily arrives home, a dark side of prodigy son Joshua slowly begins to reveal itself.

A couple of Manhattan yuppies are expecting their second child.  Their first child doesn't react to well to the presence of baby sister - in fact he goes Damien on the entire family.

Brad Cairn (Sam Rockwell) is a young stockbroker and seems to be in the money since the family lives in a nice Manhattan apartment.  His wife Abby (Vera Farmiga) is expecting their second child and give birth to a little girl.  The Cairn's already have a son named Joshua (Jacob Kogan).

He appears to be an extremely intelligent and attends a private school where he wears a blazer and a tie as a uniform.  He also plays piano with his favorite Ned (Dallas Roberts).  His mother is not having a good time with the birth of child number two and seems to be having postpartum depression.  Brad is busy trying to get some big deals at work so he doesn't seem to notice at first that Joshua is acting strangely to the arrival of his little sister.  In fact, he seems to be making some sort of devious plans for baby sister and also using mom's depression to his advantage (and even accentuates it).

Suddenly dad begins to have to handle mom's increasing insanity and starts notice that Joshua has plans that he's working on behind the scenes - and they're not plans that will have a happy ending.

Joshua definitely brings to mind another demonic lad - Damien from Omen (with a pinch of Rosemary's Baby thrown in for good measure).  In fact, the cover basically screams that.  However this naughty boy doesn't have an evil, supernatural entity that fathered him.  What we do have is an intelligent boy but he's also cunning and appears to be without conscious.

Young Jacob Kogan does a decent job at portraying the role, but the adults also have been well cast as well.  Sam Rockwell is more know for his comedic roles but he does well as the harried father who has to deal with his wife's depression and then learns that his young son is plotting something devious.

Vera Farmiga is also good, but has to lose her mind and this can be a bit grating, as we want her to come out of her funk.  What doesn't really jibe is the reason behind his devilish ways.  It doesn't really have the payoff that we might expect, but in a child's size view of the world it might make perfect sense.

If you're looking for a good horror film, this isn't it. It's a decent piece of film making from a documentary film maker.

3247187,2,B000Y7U982,"Joshua is a 9 year old boy, living in a very expensive NYC apartment with his mother (THE DEPARTED's Vera Farmiga) and fund-manager father Sam Rockwell (CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND).  Soon to join their family is little Lilly, whose birth would seem to strengthen the family, but instead it brings up feelings in little Joshua.  Or rather, it brings up the LACK of feelings in this singularly creepy child.

JOSHUA isn't quite a horror movie...nothing supernatural happens.  What it does, however, is create a situation in which the post-partum depression (bordering on psychosis) of the mother collides with the sociopathic nature of her intelligent but emotionless son.

Joshua is obsessed with ancient Egyptian culture, particularly the methods they had for embalming and preserving their dead.  Joshua is also prone to making odd remarks out of the blue, such as ""You don't have to love me, dad.  There's no law.""  Joshua IS loved, especially by his dad...but he can't feel it, nor can he share it.  He imitates the actions of others, in an effort to fit in.  One early creepy scene has Joshua performing at a school piano recital.  We've seen him play in several earlier scenes, and we know he's brilliant.  But on stage, he imitates the horrible efforts of his peers, and plays a horrible version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" instead of Bartok.

We might think that he's simply jealous of his new sister...but he appears to be jealous of other people having emotions.  As his schemes begin to be furthered, his mother unravels and his perplexed father becomes more and more stressed about not keeping his family together.

Farmiga, a very interesting looking actress, is not given much to do beyond going steadily nuts.  Rockwell, on the other hand, plays a highly successful man who also appears to be a decent husband and doting father.  A flawed but very good guy.  An appeaser.  But when the truth of who, or what, his son is sinks in...Rockwell has some unusual reactions.  In fact, his actions in the final scenes of the film don't seem to flow from the character we knew before.  He makes a huge leap in understanding his troubling kid, but then does various ridiculous things with that knowledge.

JOSHUA is a slow-paced film...just barely interesting enough to keep watching in the early going.  As it becomes more clear what Joshua is, the film picks up...just in time to run into the unconvincing personality change in the father's character.  The film rushes to an ending, and while the final scene is effective...the ultimate feeling I was left with was ""eh, that didn't quite work.""

Rockwell is very good as the father...it is the script that betrays him.  Also, the film takes some needless digs at evangelical Christianity, in the depiction of Rockwell's mother as a kook.

So, while the film has its creepy moments and a good performance...it is a 60 minute story stretched over 106 minutes...thus slowed to a crawl and peppered with lazy writing.  I can't quite recommend it.",1201910400,4,3009,4.881656804733728

The only reason I watched it was to see Vera Farmiga and she only lasted for a little over half the movie. No, she doesn't die, but she isn't in the last part of the movie.
