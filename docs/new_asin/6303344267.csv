638924,5,6303344267,"If you're looking for a great comedy performance on video, then look no further, because ""No Cure for Cancer"" is your video! You will never see anything that even comes close to this comic performance. Denis Leary is one of the best at what he does. For about 60 minutes, he takes you on a hillarious journey filled with drugs, parents, red meat, living in New York, drinking, smoking, and of course, making fun of the French!! Do not drink anything while you watch this, becuase chances are you're going to be spiting it out from laughing so hard. His style is cleary original and honest, and his fast talking, ticked off attitude fills this performance with non stop humor. He gets funnier every time I see this. Denis Leary is a comical genius who fears nothing. See this video as soon as you can. Believe me, you will not regret it. This is a must have for anyone who loves stand up comedy and loves to laugh.",998784000,12,913,4.440476190476191
638925,5,6303344267,"Denis Leary rocks!  He is the most original, funny man alive!  This movie had me laughing out loud almost the whole time- don't watch the edited versions on tv though, they cut out the famous ""NyQuil"" part, and  other greats.  Definitely buy this one.",963532800,3,251,4.636363636363637
638926,5,6303344267,"Denis is the greatest.  He tells everyone what we all want to say but don't have the gutts to say. This video is the best, it had me rolling out of my chair.  The whole thing about the bongs was so ture, and about the 10  years off my life... Thank God.  Thanks, stacie",952387200,7,269,3.925925925925926
638927,5,6303344267,Forget it. If you think you had the solution for all the world's problems Denis Leary kills that illusion with an excellent show of Leary-comedy-and-look-at-the-world-irony. Comedylovers you gotta have this  one.,923788800,,212,5.838709677419355
638928,5,6303344267,"After watching this video about six thousand times, I can tell you it kicks sour croutons.  Denis Leary reads into the hearts and minds of all people with very twisted senses of humor.  Even if you have a run-of-the-mill sense of  humor, you will undoubtedly find this at least amusing.  He rants about  everything and even takes a moment to talk about his son, which was very  touching....until the end.  Then it was just funny.  I cannot recommend it  enough.  You'll cuss for weeks after watching it.  You'll find yourself  making fun of everything while talking really fast.  It might even change  you into a cynical potatoe!5 stars to Mr. Leary for speaking my mind!  Cheers!",915321600,2,680,4.741379310344827
638929,5,6303344267,"What can I say? The video, the CD, it is all terrific. It's Denis in his *first* prime, his big-haired post MTV era. The man rants about everything from Smoking to the French, and also includes an almost tear-jerking story  about his first child (it quickly turns funny again.)
It also includes a  great song, ""Asshole,"" which is about you average lazy American  today. You may have seen it on Comedy Central.
I also recommend  ""Lock 'N Load"" for any fan, which unfortunetly is not available.  It is, however, available on CD.",915321600,7,526,4.673913043478261
7845617,3,6303344267,"There are some genuinely amusing parts to this. I mean, I laughed.  Not as hard as with Leary's previous performances, but it was still funny enough.",1386028800,,149,4.730769230769231
7845618,5,6303344267,"Good choice if you can deal with a high energy comic, a little nasty but in context I was as exhausted as Leary when performance ended.",1378771200,,135,4.230769230769231
7845619,5,6303344267,"One of my all time favorites. Had the VHS, needed to get a DVD copy, I liked it so much. This is Denis at his best. If you know his stand up at all and haven't seen or heard it, do yourself a favor and get. Too many funny lines to narrow down.",1303257600,,243,3.6037735849056602
7845620,5,6303344267,I've seen and heard this act many times and it still cracks me up everytime. Dennis Leary is great!,1118707200,,99,4.2631578947368425
7845621,2,6303344267,"This was good at one point, about a decade ago, but alot happens in a decade. First half he's got a little too much coke-laced hyperactivity going on, second gets better.",1111622400,,170,4.516129032258065
7845622,5,6303344267,This tape is hallarious. Denis Leary is a great comedian. If you don't have this tape or CD buy it now! If you enjoyed this VHS or CD as much as i did pick up the Lock n' Load CD right now!,1046908800,3,189,3.5238095238095237
7845623,5,6303344267,"After seeing ""Two if by Sea"" with Denis Leary and Sandra Bullock--and liking both the movie and Leary's performance--I wanted to see more of this frenetic comedian.  The only other stand-up who comes immediately to mind whose pure energy and enthusiasm are as memorable as Leary's died a few years ago of cancer; I can't remember his name:  curly red hair, Jewish man about 45 or so.  (Sorry, the name will come to me later.  It might be Dennis Wolfberg; the name just escapes me.)  Anyway, Leary is totally over-the-top in this live performance, and my husband and I simply howled with laughter through the entire hour.  First we set up our kids in another room with a sweet kiddy-movie and we locked our bedroom door, however.  We don't let our children HEAR the kind of raw language that Leary employs, but Hubby and I laughed hard enough to choke and cry.  Leary's material seems as fresh and timely today as it did back in '94 or so when he recorded the special.  Man, what a wit.  I am looking forward to seeing more of his work.  I'm sorry I've overlooked this comic for so long.  If you can get a copy of ""No Cure for Cancer,"" you're guaranteed an hour of hilarity.  Hope you enjoy this VHS as much as we did!",1012176000,,1217,4.403587443946188
7845624,5,6303344267,"Where to start, where to start...okay, I saw, like, ten seconds of this performance when I was about three months shy of thirteen. Long story. Anyway, years later, I bought the No Cure CD out of vague curiosity (back when record stores didn't card underage teenagers as if it were a liquor store) - I'd remembered Leary's name and seen him on TV a couple times, but wasn't quite sure what to make of him. Anyway, I listened to the record all the way through and thought it was absolutely hysterical. The same year, a friend of mine introduced me to the entire Showtime special, and I was hooked. Her dad, however, was [upset], and we were subsequently banned from his video collection.
So, a while ago Comedy Central ran No Cure one night, but let me tell ya - it's just not the same without all the screaming and swearing. I made up my mind at that point to search out the video and buy it once and for all. And I did. And it's still hysterical. And I'm still hooked. Either you like Leary or you don't, and those of us who do know he speaks only his mind, which tends to be the truth. So listen up, and if you don't like what you hear, go buy yourself a helmet - you're gonna need it. Anyone who hasn't yet seen this video, I highly recommend it. If you've heard him perform, wait 'til you see him. This tape contains a whole mess of stuff that's not on the CD, so trust me, it's worth the while. For those who prefer their comedy light and their world sunny, there's denial. For those of us who know better, there's Denis Leary. Enjoy, my friends.",1010102400,4,1550,4.257627118644068
7845625,5,6303344267,"Denis Leary is one of the best comedians out there. He is the reason I'm a smoker and I'm going to stay a smoker. He makes true points about how smoking will kill you, but who cares, I don't feel like wearing diapers when I'm 80 years old and I also don't feel like being spoon fed by my children, die young and happy.
This isin't the only thing he talks about, he also makes cracks on every drug out there, the 70's, raising kids, putting down ethnic groups, alcohol, etc. etc. This is a ""must buy"" and is well worth it.",1009324800,,521,4.117647058823529
