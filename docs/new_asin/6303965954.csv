741735,4,6303965954,Nothing at all serious about this flick.  Just kick back and enjoy a B movie that pokes good fun at UFO invasion movies.,1504915200,5,120,4.217391304347826
741736,5,6303965954,"A camera is found at a yard sale that still has undeveloped pictures in it. The finder is a Pulitzer Prize winning photographer that collects cameras. This picture will change his life and lead him on a quest joined by a woman who lost her dad in under mysterious circumstances.

After you experience this movie, you will never go back to the 'X-files"" You will see the real Rod Steiger as Col. Buck Gunner. You will see many elements from this movie copied in other movies as ""Mars attacks"" and ""Five Million miles to Earth"" Only this movie is more realistic. You will hear faux pas as saying ""Bug in a rug"" in the presence of aliens.

However if you live in a trailer park, don't watch this under any circumstances.",1501027200,5,717,4.465648854961832

741739,4,6303965954,"A older movie and i i don't have much hope for it ever coming out in DVD but we'll wait and see and if it does i will purchase it.
Just a fun and funny popcorn movie.",1422230400,2,166,3.5135135135135136
741740,5,6303965954,"This is one of my favorite movies and I really want it to come out on DVD.  The characters in the story are great and there are quite a few things that are a little weird, twisted, or unexplained so there are things to think about once it's over.  If you like films like John Paizs' ""Top of the Food Chain"" or his ""Crime Wave"" then I think you'll appreciate ""Out There"" too.",1313107200,4,374,4.109589041095891
741741,4,6303965954,"This is a movie I'd like to see released on DVD.  It's a light comedy that involves people trying to get to the bottom of a UFO mystery.  It includes the sort of wacky UFO-obsessed characters you hear real-life UFO hunter/personality Jim Moseley describe in his autobiographical book ""Shockingly Close to the Truth"".

I like this movie for showing the blurred line between UFO reality and fiction. If you're a fan of UFOs and classic UFO movies of the 1950s, you'll enjoy this loving look at both.",1205280000,7,497,4.689655172413793
741742,1,6303965954,"This morning I found a movie that mom would have watched while cleaning the house.  I joked with Lucy that we might have found somebody's Master Thesis, ""How to make a really bad Sci-fi movie for under a thousand dollars"".  The movie's name, ""Out There"", in case you have a friend who owes you money and you want to inflict some extra damage as a warning to other dead beats.

I don't want to spoil it for die hard Sci-fi movie fans, those who may want to endure 98 minutes of toss salad scripting and plot development; but you might want to have some polka music playing to help get you through this one.",1166227200,,605,4.2894736842105265
741743,4,6303965954,"This spoof is very good for what it tries to do.  The actors are endearing, if sometimes a little ""thick"", the writing is wonderful and bitter and the story line is so off the wall that it actually could be true.  You will NEVER look at a trailer park in the same way after you see this movie, or look at portapotties, or accordians, or packing popcorn.  Yes, they are all involved in this neat little story.  Not the finest movie I've ever seen, but one that I love to watch for its great comedic moments.",1137283200,8,506,4.239583333333333
7857212,3,6303965954,"There were no 3 star reviews so I thought I'd be the first. I would not call it good. but it could have been worse. It was funny in a really dumb kinda way. If you have time to waste, nothing better to do and can't find anything you want to really watch then its better than some of the crappy alien films.",1514073600,,306,3.873015873015873
7857213,1,6303965954,"Doing good to give it one STAR acting if one could call it that, Was so bad the story line I quite watching",1508630400,,107,3.6956521739130435
7857214,2,6303965954,It was rather long it for the plot it seemed good at first but the movie took too long to get to the core of the plot and in the end was week. The acting was good it had a good budget for the time but no special effects at all and where I don't think it's like mars attacks like other people have said. It was not that bad I did watch it all the movie reminds me of a cartoon or something just seems to ramble on  in some spots like my review.,1508112000,,443,3.663157894736842

7857218,4,6303965954,"Define a bad movie.  Not hard to do.  If it deliberately incites violence, or casts scorn and blame on guiltless people, or distorts history or truth, it's bad no matter how skillfully made.  If it shows bad craftsmanship, or an obvious disdain for the tastes of its intended audience, it's a bad movie. ""Out There"" has none of those faults.  Is it a great movie? Hah! No way!
It's an 'okay' movie, intended to amuse people without resorting to the lowest common denominator of comedy.  It amused me, though I doubt I'll watch it again.
The Marilyn Monroe impersonator had a few moments of eerie success.  The special effects were more in the viewer's head than on the screen, but they were all that was really required.  Give it a try.  UFO themed productions, spoofed or dead serious, are usually good for a laugh.",1506643200,2,816,4.618055555555555

7857220,2,6303965954,"Despite having actors I liked in the movie, the acting was terrible.  The plot, acting and filming was terrible.  I can't believe I watched the entire movie!  If you like comedy, this film qualifies as comedy with terrible acting.  I honestly cannot believe I watched the entire movie.  I was happy to let it run when I had to go to the kitchen, bathroom or anywhere.  Not fun for me, scratching my head, wondering",1506124800,,414,4.527027027027027
