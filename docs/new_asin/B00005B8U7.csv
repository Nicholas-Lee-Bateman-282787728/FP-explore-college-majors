1421487,4,B00005B8U7,"Basically i don't give  about the not so good reviews about this anime. BAOH in my opinion, is another good example why i love anime; it has a decent plot although borrowing elements from GUYVER and the movie firestarter. but adds a bit of originality of it's own especially regarding the charcter designs, weapons and powers; i.e. the shooting bees phenomenom
(baoh's hair is used as electric particles that shoot out like darts)  and it doesn't hld back when it comes to action, although the gore is a bit gratuitous that one ends up thinking,is baoh a superhero/sci-fi actioner or a horror anime?
as for familiar designs, Dr. kasumione resembles G.I. JOE'S Dr. Mindbender, walken is a combination of the tracker from firestarter (played by george c. scott) and one of the mutants from x-men. Durdo has an endoskeleton like the terminator and the three steel masked finacers of Doress look like a certain villian from a certain toyline/comic/carton.
the arm saber however is exactly like guyver's and that's where the simularity ends. lol
the DVD is bare bones meaning; no extras but inside the case is a nice filecard which explains baoh and his mysterious powers along with song lyrics speaking of which; the original japanese version of soldier is way better than the english song.
the english dub from the dvd isn't bad, but the cheesy song ""can't stop loving you"" has got to go!!!
it does not blend into the dark superhero thriller world of BAOH.
INCLOSNG the animaton still holds up even 15 years later. thanks to th talented folks o toho/shinshuiea (FIST OF THE NORTHSTAR and ANGELCOP)
if your'e lokng for a short balls to the wall superheroesque title, this buds for you. for those  seeking something more complicated..well there's always garasaki and boogiepop phantom..zzzzzzzzzzz",1073174400,,1792,4.966666666666667
7937107,5,B00005B8U7,"Anime offers a lot different genres.  I guess you'd call this a ""one-off OVA"".  Meaning: one story, no follow-up, no sequel.  Most of them hover around 45 to 50 minutes.  Short and sweet, so to speak!  Baoh (1989), might very well be the best of the ""one-offs"".  Don't get me wrong, there are many competitors to that opinion!  A few examples are:  Neo Tokyo (1986), Black Magic M-66 (1987), Judge (1991) or Tokyo Babylon (1992); to name a few.  However, I got say that Baoh gets to it a little better than those.  It's not quite like any other anime that I've seen before or after.  Really a unique blend of a story.  I don't get into 'everything' anime.  But, this is good stuff!",1517875200,,681,4.395161290322581

7937110,4,B00005B8U7,"Although not quite the classic as a film of such caliber as ""Vampire Hunter D"", it's still a solid anime worth watching. The plot is quite simple, a govt power begins dabbling in things angels fear to do and unleash a string of biological nightmares and suddenly controlling such things becomes a major problem. BAOH, a wormlike creature infects people, attaches to their brains and such a host becomes a psychic superpower. Then the question of human willpower comes into play as the hosts infected still can make their own choices and ultimately the creators of such monstrosities become the target.",1425945600,,601,4.96039603960396

7937113,3,B00005B8U7,"Baoh is based off a pretty good manga series. Unfortunately, they didn't translate it over to well to the anime form. Though the animation is pretty good, most of the plot is thrown out the window. Baoh is a parasite that the government has created that when injected into a host when work its way up to the brain and attach. When the host is harmed or adrenaline starts to pump, Baoh takes over the host body, creating the host to become superhuman with superpowers. When the host in this anime takes over Ikuroo, he comes underattack from the government after he has escaped. He must protect a young girl, who herself has a precognitive gift, from getting killed by the governments loose cannons. The anime is short and is only one episode so everything happens quickly and violently. Not an anime for kids.",1203379200,,809,4.625
7937114,3,B00005B8U7,"BaOH is a much older anime so I wasn't expecting very much when I bought it.  It turned out pretty well in the end.  The animation is pretty modern looking in comparison to other anime made at that time.  The story line is quite different and the best part of the show.  BaOH is a parasitic worm developed by an unethical scientific organization (Doress) trying to make new weapons to sell.  This worm burrows into the brain and takes control of the hosts body whenever it is threatened.  Surprisingly, the worm seems to share the hosts feelings and helps those whom the host loves.  But beware the people who get in their way! The unusual love relationship between the two main protagonists is rather unique.  It was perhaps the best thought out part.  The real problem with BaOh is that the villians are rather unoriginal, mimicking many other shows from that period, and that it was just too darn short!  To make things worse, during the fights the screen will freeze when a ""new"" attack is performed and they will actually write the name of it on the bottom of the screen.  They explain the ""specifics"" of it and it is always constantly referred to as a ""phenomena"".  These constant interuptions shorten an already short show. The violence can also be repetitive and show an unneccessay amount of brains and muscle tissue.  Even though the show was way too short for any real character development, the ending makes watching it all worth it.  Sumire leaves Ikuroo all wet so that later she can hang him out to dry.  What a conniving little girl she is! Although there are problems with this anime, its age and interesting plot add something different to your library.  Before you know it you will have rewatched it a dozen times without realizing it.  I advise that you not pay too much for it as there are many other animes and OVA's that deliver quantity AND quality. However, if you can get it for less I highly recommend it.",1124323200,,1932,4.58600583090379
7937115,5,B00005B8U7,"Reason to get this movie. It has: action, drama, gore blood, profanity, emotion, great animation. This is a great classic 80's anime just like ""Akira"".",1122768000,2,151,5.08
7937116,4,B00005B8U7,"BAOH is a compact anime sci-fi action thriller about a teenaged boy injected with ""Baoh,"" a parasitic worm which gives him a series of steadily accelerating super powers and bio-engineered weapons which he uses to defend himself against the onslaught of agents and assassins sent to kill him after he escapes from a top secret corporate-government project. Made in 1989, it has exactly the kind of detailed and boldly drawn comic book-style illustration and fluidly animated scenes of violent action that make so much anime of the mid-to-late 1980s so distinctive. When the boy goes into defensive ""Baoh"" mode, he dispatches his heavily-armed pursuers in the most spectacularly gory fashion this side of NINJA SCROLL. For those who need a break from such carnage there are scenes with the boy's cute and spunky sidekick, Sumire, a nine-year-old girl whose psychic powers make her a target of the bad guys as well. When the girl is eventually abducted and held hostage, ""Baoh"" launches a one-man assault on the organization's secret headquarters.

My only complaint is that, as a single OAV volume running just under 47 minutes, it's way too short. It's based on a manga that was published in English (by Viz) in two volumes and it follows the look of the manga and the overall storyline very closely. The anime leaves out various incidents that would have filled out the story, explained things a little more, and given it a little more depth. If they'd simply filmed everything in the manga they would have had a very satisfying 90-to-100-minute feature-length film or two-part OAV. Still, it's a consistently enjoyable work for fans of this genre and one which rates repeat viewings.",1120953600,5,1685,4.99644128113879
