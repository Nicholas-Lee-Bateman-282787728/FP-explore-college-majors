2739467,5,B000MRA57Y,"As always, Dionne doesn't disappoint. Even in these latter years of her career, she still has the presence, style and voice that is only hers. One can never go wrong with a Dionne song no matter whose done it before. She is truly a gem and a class act.",1179705600,3,252,4.163265306122449
2739468,5,B000MRA57Y,"Dionne warwick's voice is still in fine form.

I really enjoyed when she had  everone sing along with her on What The world Needs Now.  And it was great to her sing Heartbreaker, one of Dioone's classic hits.  All of her greatest hits are on this DVD.

For me it is a must have DVD.",1179360000,,282,4.054545454545455
2739469,5,B000MRA57Y,"I waited for this video to become available in a U.S. format and the wait was more than worth it. I have followed this lady's career for almost forty years and she just gets better like fine wine. Whatever she ""may"" have lost in range she has beautifully managed with finesse and nuance. There is wisdom, passion and life experience in each song, it is beautiful. Her comments are brief but delightful. She looks wonderful and in customary Dionne fashion her performance is not bright and flashy diamonds but perfect incomparable pearls. Every note is purposeful and I know that she is singing just to me. If you like Dionne even a little bit this treasure belongs in your collection. I watch it over and over again.",1178928000,7,716,4.645669291338582
2739470,4,B000MRA57Y,"I totally agree with the other review I read. Dionne's age and smoking have taken her toll but she can stll sing on key. She has great technique and always has. I saw her with Burt Bacharach several years and was mesmorized. I had been a fan for many years and was afraid I wouldn't enjoy it but it was a dream come true and I met her and Burt backstage. Anyway, I am somewhat disappointed because everything on this DVD is in a lot lower key but for being her age, she does do quite a phenomenal job. So, I have mixed feelings for this one. I played the old DVD that is also on here and compared. She is a lot younger on that one and sings a lot higher and is more animated, stands up. There is a recent interview with her on the DVD as an extra. She makes the comment about her being a lot younger. That one I will have to say is better than this one. Maybe, if she didn't smoke, she might have a higher range now. If you are a true Dionne fan, you will enjoy this. She sings her movie hits, Here I Am, The Look of Love, A House Is Not a Home, Alfie, Valley of the Dolls along with her usual Walk on By, Do You Know the Way to San Jose? I'll Never Love This Way Again, I'll Never Fall In Love Again, Heartbreaker. Dionne does have great technique. I doubt she ever sings a song the same way twice. She does alternate notes, rhythms. She is a true musician in every sense of the word. She sings with her son on I Say a Little Prayer for You but doesn't mention that he's her son. David Elliot is his name. I like the different take on I Say a Little Prayer for You with her son. It's kind of the same arrangement on Dionne Sings Dionne CD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dionne-Sings-Dionne/dp/B00000DBWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dionne Sings Dionne</a>Overall, it's worth the money. Also, better than the DVD with her in the rain in casual clothes at some festival. I also want to recommend a CD that is a Japanese Import with remakes of some of her hits. That is better than her US release of a CD with duets with Gloria Estefan. I guess I'm reveiwing all those as well. Anyway, if you are a true fan you will enjoy this DVD but you might be somewhat disappointed in her low range.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Concert-Classics/dp/B0007WQHOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Concert Classics</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Friends-Me/dp/B000IFQLAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Friends & Me</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dionne-Warwick-Live-Forever-Gold-Special-Edition/dp/B00023TG7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dionne Warwick Live :Forever Gold (Special Edition)</a>",1177804800,4,2737,5.222727272727273
2739471,4,B000MRA57Y,"I just received my copy of this DVD.  I must say that Dionne's voice is not what it used to be but is more than I expected!!  There are times during this concert when I have to realize that I am a fan and must understand that she has been performing for close to 5 decades!!  So, the toll of smoking and other things are quiet evident!  But, then, I listen to when she is ""warmed up"" and I don't quiet miss the vocal range that she once had cuz she is what we call a 'true preformer'.  She knows how to caress a note, adjust her tone to hit the note and make the range etc.  I found myself concentrating on her technique (after watching the DVD for the 4th time tonight) and forgeting about the wonderful music that she has supplied the public with for ages!!!

This DVD covers a live concert in 2005, in the UK and musically, she covers LOTS of ground here.  As a Dionne fan, I have purchased ALL of her catalog of music, (the Scepter, the Warner, the Arista and now Concord Years) and I'm only 37....LOLOLOLOL!!! She still has that 'presences' that lots of performers only try to recreate.  Its a small venue where she is performing (maybe 2000 people)  Her band sounds very good and takes Dionne's direction well.  The highlight for this fan is hear ""non-Dionne"" songs like Arthur's Theme, The Reason Why We Sing and Children, Go Where I Send Thee.

Dionne is in her mid sixtites and still packin' them in!! I will see here in Brooklyn in April 2007.  I'm so glad that this DVD exists!  Purchase it and know that this is the woman who set a tone for Pop Music not that long ago.  Then, go on youtube and search a few soild gold performances and know that you have just viewed one of the greatest that America had/has to offer "")",1176163200,15,1731,4.250764525993884
8171095,2,B000MRA57Y,"This is a big disappointment to those of us who remember the young, vibrant and powerful Dionne. If that's you, buy something else.",1460937600,,131,4.739130434782608

8171098,5,B000MRA57Y,"I purchased two video's of Dionne Warwick. This is a MUST HAVE!  She is 65 yrs old and is unmistakable, her voice, her style, her grace, and above all, her repertoire of those classics one remembers from her heyday. Again a must have for a fan of great modern music. BTW the price is an absolute bargain!",1387756800,,304,4.333333333333333

8171100,5,B000MRA57Y,I am a huge fan of Dionne Warwick and I had to have have this as a part of my collection. She is such an amazing singer and she performs many of her greatest hits on this DVD. You will really love this purchase!,1362268800,,211,3.8181818181818183
8171101,5,B000MRA57Y,"This concert was filmed in the United Kingdom on the last day of Dionne Warwick's tour in 2005. Dionne began the evening with an acknowledgement of the audience and an invitation to join in the singing when it felt like doing so. This evening she performed 26 of her many great hits. Dionne was backed by 6 very competent musicians. Her son David Elliott made a guest appearance and performed two songs with her. David has performed with his mother in the past at other concerts.

With 63 CDs to her credit (she stated that) selecting only 26 songs to perform would not be an easy task. But Dionne tried impressively and managed to squeeze in a gospel song, going back to her roots. Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross are famous for singing high notes. Occasional low notes have always been a part of Dionne's repertoire and I look forward to hearing those. And she did not disappoint. A jazzed up version of ""Do you know the way to San Jose"" was performed in honor of the late queen of salsa, Celia Cruz.

The picture quality of the DVD is very good and audio (DTS) is excellent. Dionne- Live In Concert deserves a blue-ray edition.",1356134400,,1129,4.5024390243902435

8171103,5,B000MRA57Y,I bought this because I wanted it to be like the concert we saw Dionne in 2 years ago. And it was. Very good. I will treasure this.,1235174400,,131,3.7142857142857144
8171104,5,B000MRA57Y,"I agree with all the other review's, Dionne does not sound like she once did but boy was I suprised when I started watching this concert,she sounded wonderful,she really gave it all she had, I've watched it over and over again and played it for all my friends,if you are Dionne fan's
like I am, get this DVD you will not be sorry......",1200009600,,335,4.333333333333333
