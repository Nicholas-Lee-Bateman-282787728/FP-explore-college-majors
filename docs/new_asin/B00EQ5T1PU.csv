5934135,1,B00EQ5T1PU,"Lake Eerie started out with GREAT potential but starts to fade after awhile & then turns into complete & total..... The way it started was AWESOME.I had high hopes for this movie but after Kate found what she found & saw what she saw in the drawer, the movie starts to fade, things just get weird & it's all downhill from there. The story behind why the house is haunted was lame. The worst acting was between Kate & Autumn in the last few minutes & the ending was the worst part of the movie. It was just pointless & stupid. It made no sense at all. I should've turned it off earlier but I wanted to see how it would end. The best part of the movie & the only things worth watching were the 1st 15-20 minutes & Lance Henriksen even though he really wasn't in it. Lake Eerie is the type of movie I'd expect to fall asleep while watching so it really surprised me that I didn't. If you ever get a chance to see it, I'd skip it if I were you. Go see something else

Last but not least, I read on imdb that Al Snow was The Man In Black. I did not know that while watching Lake Eerie. If you're a BIG wrestling fan like I am then I thought you might like to know",1483228800,,1158,3.9699570815450644

5934140,3,B00EQ5T1PU,"This was a low budget direct to video horror film and was way out there in terms of storytelling.  I guess it was okay.  The main character was likable which is why I'm giving it three stars, but other than that, this movie was strange concerning interdimensions, a mystery and other stuff.

5934141,2,B00EQ5T1PU,"Mostly lousy if relatively ambitious low-budget horror film about a young widow (Meredith Majors, doing double duty as screenwriter and star) who moves into a remote house after the coastal tourist season has ended so she could focus on her painting and grieve.  It turns out that she isn't alone in the house, but exactly what is there with her turns out to be more confusing than scary.

Majors doesn't really distinguish herself as an actress or screenwriter, although Lake Eerie is a bit too ambitious to dismiss as a mere vanity project.  She's trying to make a supernatural horror film and a psychological one and also throw in a bit of a supernatural love story.  She also provides a fairly involved mythology to explain what's going on in the house.

The effort put into Lake Eerie is obvious and commendable, but the acting is uneven at best and the writing frequently clumsy.  This qualifies as above average for a straight to video horror effort, but only just barely.",1473206400,,979,4.763313609467455

I liked that they had actresses (and 2 actors) that i didn't know except Lance Henrickson. The movie startes out good, and after the first 10 laughable minutes it gets WORSE! The kid in the begining was CREEPY! The whole cast was laughable, the lines that were said and the way they said them made me think of a comedy ""you mean this house is a portal to another dimnesion?"" I'm pretty sure the girl was being serious while asking that rahter stupid question.
The scares are limited. it doesn't really scare you, it tries to make you jump but only once did it REALLY scare me. There is just something off about the characters, not laughable (cause well they ARE very laughable!) but just odd.

It says on IMDB website Biography, that "" Chris... moving to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of making films"".  I think this is the end of the road for him.

Chris' wife, the main actress, is seen popping valium pills all through the film..... when, we the audience, knows it had to be Speed... so she would not fall asleep during the filming of it.

The film had some thrills, chills, and funny moments. Seeing some classic acting really brought a classic vibe to this film. The cinematography brought beauty to the story's cloudy surroundings. The soundtrack fit the mood of the story perfectly. If you like indie horror films, you should check it out. It's a fun ride!",1459814400,2,496,4.712643678160919
5934163,3,B00EQ5T1PU,"Lake Eerie is less horror and more a mixture of suspense and sci-fi.  It was written by Meredith Majors (who also stars) and directed by Chris Majors (the duo is currently working on a new film, Echo of Evil).

The plot of Lake Eerie is in some ways slow to develop, but a lot of that has to do with the deliberate choice to reveal things sparsely rather than poor pacing.  Kate Ryan (Meredith Majors) is recovering from some personal losses and crisis and has moved from Idaho to the shores of Lake Erie for a new start.  She chooses an old house, including all the aged furnishings and belongings of the prior owner.  Although it has been taken care of, the home has been unoccupied since the 60s.  Soon she learns the prior owner was an archeologist who was investigating some curious artifacts.  And quickly strange things begin to happen, leaving Kate to try and decide if her mental instability is rearing its ugly head, or if she is being confronted with forces she cannot explain.

The real gem in this film is without question Betsy Baker, who plays nosy and eccentric neighbor Eliza.  Horror fans might recognize Betsys name, but if you dont, her most famous role was as Ashs girlfriend Linda in the original Evil Dead.  Even to this day fans encourage her to thrill them with her Were gonna get you, were gonna get you, not another peep, time to go to sleep chant.  In Lake Eerie, Baker is a tour de force, savoring her scenes the way a wine aficionado enjoys a rare vintage.  It helps that she and Meredith Majors have very good on-screen chemistry, dancing between friendly banter and strained frustration.

The great Lance Henriksen makes an appearance as Kates father, left back at the Idaho farm and worried about the well-being of his troubled daughter.  He doesnt get a lot of screen time, which is a disappointment.  Henriksen is in many ways a next-generation Peter Cushing: he can play a range of characters and no matter how goofy the dialogue he might be given it sounds believable and powerful when it comes out of his mouth.

If I have quibbles with Lake Eerie, the first is in some of the supporting cast.  Anne Leigh Cooper as Elizas niece Autumn has to jump between excited, upbeat college kid to serious researcher and she never really finds a comfortable middle ground between the two.  Ben Furney, in his scenes as Kates former husband, seems like oil to Kates water; they simply don't carry any believable emotion as a loving couple.

My other complaint would be the resolution of the story.  Admittedly a portion of this is because they wanted to leave an opening for a possible sequel.  So I can allow a partial pass for that transgression.  Obviously I cant give you a lot of detail, because I want to avoid any possible spoilers.

Lake Eerie isn't Hellraiser or Poltergeist quality, but it didn't have the budget or commercial backing for that kind of punch.  But it is enjoyable, so if you get a chance to pick up the DVD or watch it on Amazon Video or some other On-Demand service I say go ahead.

Oh, and Victoria Johnstone as The Countess can visit my nightmares anytime.",1457740800,2,3111,4.582278481012659

Single woman moves into old house.  It's not an isolated house out in the middle of nowhere, but one with neighbors practically crunched up against her on both sides, so you immediately lose an eeriness factor there.  I watched until she comes home after going to a neighbor's to use the phone.  It is dark, she goes in house, lights go off, she goes upstairs with candle, sees hooded figure standing at end of hallway.  And what does she do?  Hurriedly makes her way downstairs, scrambles through kitchen drawers for a knife (backdoor 3 ft. to her right), then takes knife and candle and goes back into dark living room, curls up on a chaise longue and sits until she falls asleep.

I could forgive the bad acting and less than stellar effects if the story was in anyway cohesive. Its basically two separate movies with the latter half being truly unwatchable. The main character supposedly has a mental illness for which she takes Valium...fine, but no one is prescribed 5 valium at a time as many times a day as one wants, at least no one who needs to be awake. The dead husband storyline which is a central part of the synopsis is never fleshed out and left unexplained. The worst part is the ending, in an attempt to be different (which I normally applaud) the movie takes yet another unneeded sharp left turn.
