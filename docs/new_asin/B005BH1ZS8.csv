8528322,5,B005BH1ZS8,"I just bought this 6/6/12 and Im really happy I did. I watch a Kim Kardashian ass load of movies and this preview compilation is legit ""trailer trash"". A ton of previews that just keep coming at you for over 2 hours. Jam packed with monsters, T & A, sensationalism, nostalgia and just loads of fun.

I have nothing to do with the guys who produced this gem but Im glad they did. Thanks. Anyone who buys will definitely get their dineros worth. Is the dollar that bad these days????!",1339891200,5,482,4.355555555555555
