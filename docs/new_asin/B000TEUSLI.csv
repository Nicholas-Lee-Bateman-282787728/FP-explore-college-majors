8208763,5,B000TEUSLI,"Hosted by a Navy Seal, this is a fun, and fast paced presentation of cutting edge weapontry, that all military history buffs and those who want to know what is in development will love. Full of interesting weapons and military ingenuity here is the first season of a fantastically informative and entertaining show. Mind you when this show came out, many weapons shown have since become our present weapons used by the military or gone through some changes",1381708800,,456,4.858974358974359
8208764,5,B000TEUSLI,"I enjoyed watching this first season of ""Future Weapons"", as it was even better than I expected.

All six episodes are interesting and well filled with information. Those series offer good images of weapons but also conversations with scientists and engineers who developped them and real soldiers who use them. There is virtually no filler and every episode is densely packed with real and useful information. I learned quite a lot watching ""Future Weapons"".

Narrator, Richard ""Mack"" Machowicz, a former US Navy SEAL (1984-1995), is a very likeable person and he clearly knows a lot about military business. He certainly has a lot of humour, he feels a real passion about the topic and as with all of this the camera also certainly likes him, he is an asset for those series.

Here is the list of topics treated in those six first episodes:

Episode 1 ""No Place to Hide"": FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank misile (USA), CornerShot gun (Israel), PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer (Germany), Joint Strike Fighter (USA / UK)

Episode 2 ""Stealth"": M107 Long Range Sniper Rifle (USA), Type 212 U-boat (Germany), RQ-1 Predator unmanned air-vehicle (USA), Dominator unmanned air-vehicle (USA)

Episode 3 ""Maximum Impact"": Metal Storm gun (Australia), Thermobaric weapons, Multiple Launch Rocket System (USA), NLOS cannon (USA)

Episode 4 ""Future Shock"": EMP Weapons, Long Range Acoustic Device (USA), Advanced Tactical Laser (USA), Tactical High Energy Laser (Israel / USA), Airborne Laser (USA)

Episode 5 ""Smart Weapons"": XM982 Excalibur artillery shell (Sweden / USA), TALON/SWORDS armed robot(USA), AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopter (USA), Starstreak anti-aircraft missile (UK)

Episode 6 ""The Power of Fear"": CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon (USA), IMI Tavor TAR-21 rifle (Israel), Bioterrorism & Anthrax (USA), MOAB guided bomb (USA)

With the exception of part ""Bioterrorism and anthrax"" in Episode 6, there are no weak spots - all episodes are very well done, interesting and full of data.

I liked very much those series, I will keep my DVD and I am definitely going to buy soon the Season 2 (which offers 12 entirely new episodes!).",1360540800,,2120,5.261127596439169
8208765,1,B000TEUSLI,"A host who occasionally can't pronounce his words? Misrepresentation of history? Unfounded claims about weapon performance? Scenes repeated several times for no apparent reason? It's all here.

If you want uncensored militaristic hysteria, look no further. This sort of ""documentary"" -- containing much froth about ""how dead people are going to be when this weapon hits them"" -- is so painful -- it's difficult to watch for the few useful pieces of useful and accurate information.",1278892800,6,481,5.328947368421052
8208766,4,B000TEUSLI,"Really enjoyed

would be better if cover pages would contain more detailed content of the DVD",1243468800,,93,4.8125
8208767,5,B000TEUSLI,"Future Weeapons gives you the first look into weapons of war now only in the prototype stage. Missile launchers, Assualt Rifles, Granades and Personal Defense Technology of the Future Now. Amazing series, cant wait for the Season 2 DVD.",1198454400,8,236,5.076923076923077
