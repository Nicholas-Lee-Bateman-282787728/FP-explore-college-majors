8468634,3,B005ELVCIE,"So many ways to Armageddon, yet so little time!  I now have even less precious time left after forcing myself to sit through the History Channel's unmitigated proselytization of the end of the world.
If you like the History Channel's signature style of fast-cut editing,  pro-western propaganda, Hollywood-style disaster CGI, ominous professional voice-overs, and dubious interview segments with so-called experts, you will most likely enjoy this 7 disc marathon.  Admittedly, some of it is interesting;  I particularly enjoyed  much of the information concerning Mayan culture.  Ultimately, however, each long winded program gives its special take on Doomsday.  According to these sensationalist programs, (with few exceptions) it's not really a question of ""if,"" but a matter of exactly how & when.  The primary focus of this anthology is the the Mayan ""prediction"" of the world coming to an end on the Winter Solstice (December 21st),  2012.  Further ""evidence"" of this apocalyptic end date is allegedly corroborated via hidden information gleaned from the I Ching, Hopi traditional beliefs, Nostradamus, and even a web-based program.  The so-called experts interviewed by the History Channel state that the last day of the Mayan long calendar, December 21st, coincides with the extremely rare phenomenon of our sun being aligned with the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.  The experts further speculate that the Mayans believed that this alignment with the black hole is what will trigger a catastrophic event that brings an end to the world as we know it.  The major unknown is the ""how"":  Will the earth's magnetic poles somehow reverse, causing world wide destruction?  Will super volcanoes be triggered to erupt?  Earthquakes? Hurricanes?  Tsunamis?  All of the above?  I guess that we won't find out until December 21st - What a wonderful Christmas gift for everyone!
If all of this is just too much for you to believe, don't worry, the History Channel has more tricks up their sleeve to try to convince you that Doomsday is near:  Nuclear holocaust; giant asteroids colliding with earth; ""nanobot"" technology gone amuck;  biological terrorism; global warming; diseases, famine, & biblical signs of the apocalypse....It's all just around the corner, waiting for us!  Chicken Little was right all along... The sky IS falling!  Bruce Willis can't save us this time!
I reiterate, I did enjoy some of this anthology, however it does get to be a bit much (especially with over 14 hours of silly speculation).  When we're still here on December 22nd, 2012, and everything in the world is still going according to the status quo, I can't imagine that there will be much interest in this anthology.  Then again, if I'm wrong, there won't be anyone around to say ""I told you so!""",1346198400,2,2795,5.130530973451328
