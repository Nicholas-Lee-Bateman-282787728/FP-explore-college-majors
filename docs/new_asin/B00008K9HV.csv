1849184,3,B00008K9HV,"John might be a great drummer, but I wouldn't say he's a great teacher. The DVD is a bit boring with John's constant gaps between sentences and words making you feel like he's still think about what exactly he wants to say while you sit and wait...

A lot of the times on the DVD, John will talk about something and the demonstrations are often either too short or just not enough to fully understand what hes doing.

I must admit, I watched this DVD after watching Steven Smith's Drum Technique/History of the US Beat DVD which is possibly why I find this DVD rather disapointing...",1126569600,8,583,4.490566037735849
1849185,5,B00008K9HV,As I was watching through this dvd the thing that really stood out is blackwell's personality and great technique.  He truly put it all out there in his dvd my own drum teacher could not show me the one handed roll as effectively as blackwell did and he covers so much that you can watch this dvd again and again and still learn something new from it.  Along with the great special features of different viewing angles it is a great dvd.  Buy this dvd and start grooving.,1118188800,4,471,4.329545454545454
1849186,5,B00008K9HV,"This DVD starts out somewhat slow, but once the teaching starts you'll learn some amazing techniques.  I'll preface with the fact that Blackwell's overall style and approach does not match the direction in which I am going, but he is a master drummer who is also deeply intellectual and highly effective when it comes to imparting knowledge.

Among the ""secrets"" I learned was how to do single-handed drum rolls. I've carefully studied Buddy Rich for years and could never come close to his single-hand roll technique. However, Blackwell shows how to do it is a straightforward manner. In less than two days of practice I have it down.  That alone is worth many times the price of this DVD, but there is more.  If you've ever heard Blackwell play you'd swear that he is using a double bass pedal.  Not so - his amazing bass pedal work is single pedal, and he shows how to achieve the same speed and bass groove in the same straighforward manner as he did with the single-handed rolls.  It comes down to doing coordination exercises with your sticks and fitting in the bass patterns.  Simple on the surface, but extremely effective.

Throughout this video I learned one technique after another.  Blackwell does not jealously guard his secrets - indeed, he is effusive in giving credit to his many influences - and he comes across as sincerely interested in sharing them.  He is also a font of knowledge when it comes to the history of great drummers and, in one fascinating discussion connects the dots of influences back to Baby Dodds. Another thing I enjoyed (and learned from) is his ability to recreate the style of drummers who influenced him, then combine those styles into composite solos.

Like those who came before him, Blackwell - thanks to this video - has a profound influence on my own playing. I mentioned earlier that his and my styles diverge, but the techniques he imparted have been incorporated into my own playing, and if anyone asks me who my major influences were Blackwell will be on the short list.

If you want to take your skills to the lext level get this DVD and practice (and practice some more!)  I also recommend getting a copy of Tommy Igoe's ""Groove Essentials"" (ASIN B00064YTKM), which will augment Blackwell's techniques and expand your range and technique even more.",1101945600,31,2302,4.768261964735516

7984928,2,B00008K9HV,Why is it that literally every drum DVD spends so much time showing the drummer jamming with their bands? Do they have no material to teach?  Do they not have teaching skills? When I buy instructional DVD's I want lessons not performances. Don't waste your money on this one unless you are buying it to listen to him showing off.,1357430400,,329,4.483333333333333

7984930,3,B00008K9HV,"This is a DVD showing you how John plays...... His grooves are good and the showmanship he developed is great but techniques and teaching them is not his forte. For teachings and techniques go to guys like Chuck Silverman, Steve Smith, G.L. Stone and Jim Chapin. For his show and grooves it's ok.",1266192000,,296,4.60377358490566
7984931,3,B00008K9HV,"In looking for drum technique DVDs, I look for DVDs where the drummer teaches you clearly what he is demonstrating on the set.  John is a fantastic drummer.  However, the ""teaching"" side of the DVD is weak.  This is true particularly compared to the gold standard of teaching DVDs like Steve Smith's and even Tommy Igoe's Groove Essentials.  John doesn't slow down much of what he is doing, so whatever you pick up will be a full speed.  So, it is better if you are a highly advanced, professional level drummer.

That said, watching this DVD I picked up some amazing things to imitate -- his amazing ambidexterity with the high hat; why play it with the right hand when it's on the left side of your set -- just play mainly with the left hand.  Also the single handed roll and bass techniques are amazing and advanced.

Buy it only if you are an advanced drummer.",1198281600,4,864,4.45859872611465
7984932,5,B00008K9HV,"John Blackwell is an absolute inspiration. He is so in the pocket his grooves just make you want to dance. This DVD is a must for any drummer who loves to groove because merely observing John play teaches you more than can ever be expressed with words. On top of being an incredible drummer, he is extremely humble and so sincere and thoughtful in everything he says. It is very interesting to hear him explain who all of his influences are and share his ideas and how he developed all of the showmanship he has. My advice to any serious drummer is to buy this DVD and observe the master as he plays.",1191542400,,600,4.31858407079646

7984934,4,B00008K9HV,"I get the sense that Drummers tend not to be very good teachers on camera. Blackwell seems to be distracted, constantly searching for words. However, you do get some pretty cool tricks from the video like the one-handed roll and some stick tricks. Have fun with it.",1167782400,,265,4.659574468085107
