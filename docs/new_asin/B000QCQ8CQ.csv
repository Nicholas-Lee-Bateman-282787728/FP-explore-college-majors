In addition to brief interviews with friends and family members of the farmer who killed himself in 1995, the creators of this documentary also interviewed experts from a variety of fields: academics in rural sociology and other agriculture-related disciplines, psychologists and psychiatrists, scientific researchers, and industrial medicine specialists, to name a few.  Interviews are not isolated to the US, but also include Great Britain. It is well-produced and raises a number of questions regarding the complex causes of farmer suicide, moving far beyond the usual suspects of isolation and financial pressure to consider from a scientific and statistical perspective the neurological and psychiatric effects of certain classes of farm chemicals, without being preachy.",1361404800,,823,5.745901639344262
