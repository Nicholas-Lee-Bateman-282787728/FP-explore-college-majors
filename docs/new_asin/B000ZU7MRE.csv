8236369,3,B000ZU7MRE,"As grappling contests go this is a pretty high level field, and as it goes there are several stand out matches and a lot of fairly slow defensive matches. Video quality is just ok, not as good as the adcc or GQ videos.

The matches 13 of them, Garcia is in 4 and a couple others have some solid action. Garcia however is highly skilled and vastly superior to the the rest of the competition. I have to be honest and say half the matches are pretty much forgettable stall fests with no sustained action, or even ebb and flow action, but its worth watching for the four great Marcelo matches.",1311984000,,590,4.315315315315315
