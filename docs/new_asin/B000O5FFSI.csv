8325524,5,B000O5FFSI,"This is not an instruction video.  It can be used as a guide if you already have started an Ashtanga practice or it is simply amazing to watch these yogis and yoginis practice. The grace and strength that Jois' students have in every flow and each pose is very inspiring. I highly recommend this video, if you have any interest in Ashtanga Yoga.",1280707200,,345,4.476190476190476
