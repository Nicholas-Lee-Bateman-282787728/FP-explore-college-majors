8141589,5,B000HWYHOQ,"Are you a Ryli Morgan fan? Do you own this? Then why not? Really, director Mark Baranowski has taken the earlier filmns of his lovely wife and remastered them and put them all on one, incredible disc. DESPAIR is the tale of a wife whose husband has chosen suicide as his way out. Now she has to decide whether or not to follow him. Poignant and sad this is a fantatsically done tale of...well, Despair.
AUDITION is Ryli posing and displaying her incredible assets for the camera. In eight minutes you will be fixated on the screen.
RUNAWAY TERROR is a perfect example of the slasher genre of the 80's. Rylir Morgan plays identical twins. One is murdered by a masked killer. Her twin appears to enter the seedy side of low budget films to find out why her twin died and what she can do to solve the case.
EXPENDABLE gives us Mark Baranowski, Ryli Morgan, Brinke Stevens and Rachelle Williams in a twisted tale of a drug dealer going legit and wanting his old falme back. But she has moved on in ways that he will never understand. Ryli Morgan and Rachelle Williams are so hot in this film that it is amazing that the DVD doesn't warp from the heat.
In addition to all of this, yes there is more, we get four music videos with Ryli in them, a Ryli slideshow, bonus trailers and a promo for On Mark Productions. A good buy at twice the price.",1195776000,10,1339,4.338645418326693
