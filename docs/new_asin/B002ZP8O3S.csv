8385199,3,B002ZP8O3S,"When I ordered this vid, I was hoping that McCreight was going to focus on cold connections only.  Most of the projects discussed has soldering involved.  Also, I think the projects were more advanced beginner and may be a little intimidating if the purchaser has little to no experience with connections (especially the soldering stuff.",1393632000,,337,5.109090909090909
8385200,5,B002ZP8O3S,"This is a very informative DVD.  Tim not only shows clear and concise instructions but goes into the levels of meaning that you can build in your jewelry. I have taken classes in cold connections, and did not get half of the instruction that I got from this DVD. I loved it and will definitely buy more DVDs featuring Tim.",1383350400,,322,4.366666666666666
8385201,1,B002ZP8O3S,"Not worth the money!  I was hoping for more demonstrations of technique. I purchased the DVD because of Mr. mcCreight's reputation.  Boy was I disappointed.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Connections/dp/B002ZP8O3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Connections</a>. Would not purchase another of his products.  I have been making jewelry with cold connections for a year or so.  I was looking to expand my knowledge base and to see his technique for certain steps.  The projects on the DVD were definitely not for beginners or even advanced beginners.  Not enough information to try the projects.",1305676800,6,642,6.406976744186046
8385202,3,B002ZP8O3S,"I had high expectations, and was stunned to see him working to cold connect items that had been soldered together first.  I guess I thought everything would be cold connected and that's what I was looking for - as someone who is not in a place where soldering is permitted.  There are some interesting ideas so I had to keep an open mind when I saw those to note them, but I was disappointed.",1305331200,3,392,4.283783783783784
8385203,1,B002ZP8O3S,"For some reason I couldn't open this product.  I also tried it on another computer...same thing, wouldn't open.  Such a bummer because it was the first Tim McCreight item I have bought and was really looking forward to seeing it.",1304812800,,229,4.7
8385204,3,B002ZP8O3S,"McCreight gives a clear demonstration of basic riveting techniques. Okay as far as that goes. However, some of his demo pieces involved components that were already soldered. Why do this? It would have been better if all of his examples used cold connections ONLY. I prefer the video ""Metalwork: Making Cold Connections with Rivets"" by Susan Lenart Kazmer. She uses strictly cold connections. I own both of these videos; Kazmer's is the one that I show to my high school students for basic riveting techniques.",1304726400,8,510,5.011764705882353
8385205,5,B002ZP8O3S,"This video is presented with ease and comfort; simple ideas and explanations with
encouraging directions with open creativity to attempt at your own level the approach to using and adapting cold connections.  I was thoroughly absorbed by the presentations and could immediately start planning my first pieces using the various steps that were introduced.  I feel this video is excellent for  the beginner and those wishing to branch out and add more inventive style to the design of their pieces of art.",1293494400,2,503,5.109756097560975
