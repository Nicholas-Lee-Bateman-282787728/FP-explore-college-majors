Between the combined resources and know-how of these shoestring filmmakers, it's disappointing that more of their features weren't homeruns, but ""Raiders of the Sun"" definitely gets more things right than wrong and always entertains. This is an exemplary B-movie that will disgust Hollywood snobs but make fans of the aforementioned auteurs cheer. If you know yourself well, this movie can be your ticket to 80 minutes of good time.

The story: In a post-apocalyptic world, opposing factions in a desert wilderness fight for possession of coveted gunpowder. Two core members of the freedom-fighting faction (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Norton/dp/078062260X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Norton</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blake-Boyd/dp/B000089773/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blake Boyd</a>) disembark from their headquarters on simultaneous quests that will tip the balance of the war.

Normally, I steer clear of ""wasteland movies,"" which were a dime a dozen during the 80s and 90s and tended to be synonymous with bland plots, lackluster characters, and boring action. Luckily, this feature has no shortage of infectious enthusiasm, and the desert simply acts as a convenient setting. The story isn't anything special, but the screenplay is hard-working and does a better job than most films of the sort at maintaining consistency and nurturing character relationships. Defying B-movie convention, no character with any amount of screentime simply disappears from the film after a single scene. This is particularly nice because there are a lot of fun personalities running around. The cast is stuffed with Santiago/Corman regulars - Rick Dean, William Steis, Nick Nicholson, Henry Strzalkowski, Joseph Zucchero, Ramon D'Salva... - and even if the characters they're playing aren't interesting per se, their roundly gusto-filled performances make them fun to watch. One of my favorites is Brigitta Stenberg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rapid-Fire/dp/B000LC4Z7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rapid Fire</a>) as an admirably pro-active damsel.

Technically, the movie has enough going for it to get done what it needs. The visual style is clearly derivative of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max/dp/B003ZD9DUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max</a>, though with enough original innovations to keep things interesting (e.g. Rick Dean's taxidermic helmet). Stock footage is used for the opening and some establishing shots, but it's integrated well enough to probably make casual viewers unaware of its presence. A couple ""stone"" buildings are clearly phony, but for the most part, the movie makes practical use of existing architecture. For its budget, the film could definitely look worse.

Action-wise, the name of the game is explosions: there are no less than six scenes wherein the opposing armies do battle (with a surprisingly large number of extras) or the villains massacre a village, and there are so very many detonations that one person alone would run out of digits to count them. These large-scale fights are kind of repetitive, although the final one lasts about ten minutes and is fairly impressive, with absolutely every remaining character getting in on some of the action shooting and bombardment. There are a couple vehicle chases, including one wherein a car jumps between cliffs. Most appealingly, the film makes good use of Hong Kong veteran Richard Norton, who lacks particularly interesting opponents but shows off his martial arts well enough in claiming six of the nine fistfights for his own. Disappointingly, the most creative brawl is also the most disappointing one, wherein Blake Boyd jousts with Ned Hourani (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>) on rope swings with clubs.

If you ask me, this movie could be Cirio Santiago's one true epic. Don't compare it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/B003ELKNH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>, but within the context of its medium, this is an impressive feature that particularly Santiago should have been proud of. Tried & true fans should make a purchase at once, and B-movie -lovers in general should strongly consider a watch, too.",1424390400,,4610,6.3696
7979313,3,B000087F2E,"Richard Norton was impressive, but the plot was more or less a Road Warrior rip-off.  Video quality was good, if that matters.",1400544000,,126,4.7272727272727275

7979315,4,B000087F2E,"It has elements of Road Warrior type stuff, but it is not going to cut that mustard.  I like it for trying.  Good to see, if you like that kind of thing, like me.",1253232000,3,162,3.735294117647059
7979316,5,B000087F2E,"As presented by Roger Corman, the famous producer whose SciFi
epics have launched stellar Hollywood careers, ""Raiders of The
Sun"" on DVD allows current audiences the nostalgia of a return to the movies of the 1980s and '90s that were influenced by the success of ""Mad Max"" and ""Road Warrior.""  Martial arts movie great Richard Norton proves to be a compelling hero in one of his early lead roles - demonstrating the charisma upon which he built his starring career in action films.  Solid character actor William Steis shows up as a henchman.  The plot has all the classic apocalyptic ingredients.  We are treated to
generous doses of anarchy, insurrection, and ultimate salvation
from the dark forces who rule with an arsenal of explosives and
vehicular hardware.  Typical of Corman's releases, the budget is
not so generous, but a reliance on emerging talent and film
makers - over high costs - is often part of the Corman formula
and always a part of the fun in seeing his movies again.  Enjoy!",1043539200,12,997,4.8011695906432745
