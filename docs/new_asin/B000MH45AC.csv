8169274,5,B000MH45AC,"My wife and I ""discovered"" (when the student is ready, the master will appear) Pam at Camarillo Yoga, and took all her classes there.  Later on, after we'd moved east, we were back in California for travel, and came across Pam again, this time in Encinitas.  For a few years, we'd always make a point to drop in on at least one of her classes while we were in town.  She also takes part in Tai Chi Chih retreats throughout the year.  I couldn't swing the one in Florida last month (October), but intend on going to the next one.  Give it a try; it's relaxing, meditative, and therapeutic.",1478476800,,588,4.3577981651376145
8169275,5,B000MH45AC,"If you Google this title by Pam Towne, you will find her web site where you can purchase this item as a DVD.

I am taking a T'ai Chi Chih class now. The instructor is terrific--she's an excellent teacher and very inspiring.  But there aren't many handouts for the class, and if I didn't have this DVD, I don't know how I'd keep up.

Pam is an exceptional teacher, and just doing the practice while listening to her quiet instructions is extremely soothing and very relaxing.

This DVD includes an introduction, which you'll probably watch a couple times.  Then Pam leads you through the entire practice sequence.  If you need to practice a specific movement, you can also select it directly.

If you're serious about learning T'ai Chi Chih, this DVD is an invaluable resource.",1408147200,4,776,4.703703703703703
8169276,5,B000MH45AC,"I had taken a t'ai chi chih class introducing the first nine movements and realized this was a very beneficial exercise. I really enjoy doing t'ai chi chih and coming across this in DVD form, I knew I had to purchase it! Pam Towne is excellent in her teaching, her calmness, and her voice, which is so serene and soothing. It is a joy to go through the program with her! Her explanations of each movement are very understandable. I highly recommend this vhs/dvd for all levels of ability.",1364774400,2,488,4.49438202247191
