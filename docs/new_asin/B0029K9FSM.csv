8357830,5,B0029K9FSM,"Baby Massage is a true gift of love.  Parent and baby are afforded special moments through this amazing dvd.  The cueing is excellent and the explanations equally so.  It is very easy to replicate the demonstrations with your baby.

I've given it as a gift many times to new moms and dads.  Everyone has loved it.  I enjoy sitting with a cup of tea and just watching, it is so filled with love and a sense of calm.",1324252800,,414,4.243589743589744
8357831,4,B0029K9FSM,This DVD is so easy to use. I could sit and watch exactly what I was interested in without having to watch the whole video. There is great visual as well as verbal instruction. And the babies look like they are having fun! My baby is doing so much better since I've been doing the tummy massage.,1264377600,,295,4.192982456140351
