1634554,1,B00005NKUN,"Night of the Living Dead ""sequel"" (which ignores the previous two NOTLD sequels). Plot: A superzombie, who has survived undetected by hiding in a house for 30 years, re-animates 5 auto accident fatalities. Subsequently, construction of a used car dealership, built on the site of a graveyard, unleashes the corpses for an evening of mayhem. Although it features Tom Savini (no fx work, just a small acting role) and was produced by John Russo, this is truly a miserable effort. Completely devoid of plot, special effects and production values, it in no way resembles the 1968 shocker.",996192000,5,584,5.030927835051546

The movies are all really low budget & look like they were mastered from bad VHS sources. Carnivore really shows the VHS tape source the worst.

The best movie on this set is ""Creepy Crawlers"". It is the only movie that does not look like it came from a VHS source & is suprisingly good. Great special effects, storyline & acting.

I recommend this set only for Creepy Crawlers.",1398470400,,642,4.378151260504202

However, this is definitely a good, campy horror movie, fun to watch and is a good way to kill an hour and a half, if you have absolutely nothing better to do. I personally love bad, indie horror movies, and if you go into it expecting NOTHING, you might have a few good laughs. There isn't any real zombie violence (on a scale from 1-10 it'd be about a 5, if even), and the acting is absolutely atrocious, like I said previously. The plot is actually not that bad and the twist at the end of the movie was a nice little surprise, had they had a better budget and better actors this movie definitely would not be getting all the crappy reviews it has been, although very much understood. So if you happen to run across this rare, out of print (i believe) movie, and have absolutely nothing better to do, give it a chance and see if you think.",1368230400,,956,4.346368715083799
1634601,4,B00005NKUN,"First off, I bought this as a replacement for my VHS copy of ""Children Of The Living Dead"" and figured I might as well get 3 more flicks for the price. If you like zombie movies and Tom Savini, you have to own C.O.T.L.D. Mr. Savini's bad-assery in the opening scenes is totally worth the price of admission here.

""Creepy Crawlers"" was an unexpected treat. It had good production value, good actors,and a good story. This one will be especially appreciated by those with a bug phobia. Mr. Dean Stockwell lends the production its ""starpower"" clout by portraying the lone law enforcement officer on the island where this all goes down. I did keep finding myself expecting him to smack something in his hand and tell Sam what Ziggy says a couple of times, but I digress.

Of course, the other 2 flicks in this collection are your typical crap often used to fill up these ""4 film collections"". They are best used when you're having trouble falling asleep as they are so cheesy and boring that they will fully sedate a teenager who is jacked up on Mountain Dew and ADHD meds. The alleged ""acting"" in these films is so bad that you'll be expecting someone to disrobe at any given second.

1634603,3,B00005NKUN,"I guess I don't know a good zombie movie from a bad one because I totally don't get all the criticisms this movie has received over the years.  Over 50 1-star reviews here on amazon?  Really?  Maybe it's because I'm a total Resident Evil geek.  I believe Resident Evil 2 and 3 are some of the best video games on the Playstation.  This movie actually resembles the slow-moving, suspenseful build-up in the storyline, scenery AND zombie movements of that classic video game series.  I wasn't expecting anything approaching that given the assortment of negative feelings here on amazon.

Children of Living Dead begins with an arrogant and athletic man out in the field of some no name town and he's totally unafraid of the zombies around him.  He frequently opens fire and takes out all the zombies in the surrounding area.  He even gets creative by pushing a car down a hill, having the zombies walk up to it, then shoots and blows the vehicle up, haha.  Well everything goes fine until he enters the upstairs of a barn and stumbles upon a SUPER zombie that can't be killed like the other ones.  Upon opening fire the zombie continues forward and takes the man out!  Luckily all the children hiding in the barn make it safely outside due to a police officer being around.  Thank goodness he was there!  Of course... well, the kids aren't so lucky after all.  You'll see what I mean.

I really like the scenery.  Everything is really dark and gloomy and it actually perfectly captures a zombie infested area.  The film is presented beautifully.

The reason I'm taking away two stars is because, for one thing, the ending is just *terrible*.  No suspense or really satisfying conclusion to speak of.  The movie just ENDS and that's it.  Huh?  And two, the entire segment with the graveyard and digging up the caskets wasn't properly written.  I mean the bulldozers that were planning to build a parking lot for a car dealership would occasionally tip over a casket and everyone would stop working to check out what's inside.  This whole scene felt like it lacked serious potential for suspense.  Or perhaps the writers shouldn't have wasted so much time on this graveyard segment since nothing memorable or conclusive ever came out of it anyway.  It was overlong and pointless.

So yeah, an undeveloped storyline overall, but the believable zombie movements and presentation is actually REALLY surprisingly good.  Some of the best looking zombies next to the Resident Evil series, I kid you not.  Even the acting from the helpless victims was a step above the rest.  Overall, go ahead and hate me but I liked it!",1336089600,,2610,4.7461024498886415

Pay attention to the magic coffee scene where the bad editing has a waitress fill the main character's cup repeatedly even though he never takes a sip from it.

Or when the zombies attack the actors in their car. They attack everywhere except the drivers window, which is wide open. I guess the director didn't want to film the scene twice?

Every scene of this film is like this. You will laugh hard. The main bad guy is pretty much a vampire on top of it. So it's only sort of a zombie movie.",1322611200,,615,4.239316239316239

I guess I'll get into the story.  It jumps around a lot which is pretty annoying, you've got Tom Savini doing karate...Some annoying sheriff with a huge birthmark on his face looking around an old farm house.  Oh, and there's this zombie serial killer on the loose.  Abbot Hayes, I believe that was his name.

1634621,2,B00005NKUN,"You know, I just started to write a fairly detailed review of ""Children of the Living Dead"", and basically deleted the whole thing. What was I thinking or why should I bother? ""Children of the Living Dead"" is a lousy flick. A very loosely based sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Children of the Living Dead"" is John Russo's latest attempt to cash in on the zombie phenomenon he help create with George Romero in the late 60's. It's a sequel in only the vaguest fashion. One character references the earlier films in a forgettable scene.

Tom Savini, in an extended cameo, plays a commando-like deputy in the early scenes, but rest assured, none of his trademark special effects are present here. Alan Howarth, who helped create the music in a few John Carpenter classic horror flicks such as ""Prince of Darkness"" does lay down a decent film score, but it's wasted on this lousy film.

The film unfolds more like a vampire tale than a typical zombie flick. The lead zombie, the reanimated corpse of a serial killer and rapist, goes about creating zombies about every 15 years. Unlike other zombie flicks, the zombies here seem to target their victims...and do an extremely poor job at it.

Unfortunately, ""Children of the Living Dead"" is just a bad film, it's not even in the league of so-bad-its-good zombie films like ""Hard Rock Zombies"". This is just kind of a borefest. What a real wasted opportunity, as there are some seeds of originality here, and the main zombie cuts a pretty impressively creepy figure, but nothing comes together and the film turns into a real snoozer. Not recommended.",1229040000,,1632,4.73943661971831
1634622,1,B00005NKUN,"Even if you're pro-life, you have got to admit that this thing should have been aborted immediately. To submit this heap to anyone with more than a few brain cells is downright criminal.

Mathew Michaels (Damien Luvara) is helping oversee the construction of his father's (Philip Bowers) new car dealership in a rural Pennsylvania town. They secured a good deal on the land because it formerly used for the local cemetery. The law, Deputy Randolph (Marty Schiff), has conveniently agreed to turn the other cheek as they relocate the graves. The townsfolk, the construction crew, and everyone else nearby eventually learn the hard way that it's not a good idea to mess with someone's final resting place. An undead serial killer named Abbott Hayes would see to that.

From what I've read about the behind-the-scenes action, the vast majority of problems that this movie has can be laid squarely at the feet of screenwriter Karen Wolf. She helped produce COTLD along with her father Joseph Wolf (A Nightmare on Elm Street) and John Russo (co-writer of Night of the Living Dead). Director Tor Ramsey has let it be known that Karen Wolf was obsessive, and indeed on the verge of lunacy, regarding her script and intense micromanagement of filmmaking details that she had little experience with or knowledge of. There were to be no changes in the script, and Wolf threatened to fire anybody that tried to change something or who disagreed with her ideas. And you'd think it would be important research, but apparently she had never even seen DAWN OF THE DEAD or DAY OF THE DEAD.

If you like mysteries, there are plenty of them to find here. Like why do they wait until dark to bury the bodies in the cemetery after a funeral? Why are Abbott Hayes' hands like two times as large as a normal hand? How did he become undead in the first place? Why doesn't anybody call the cops when they witness somebody get eaten by a zombie? Why didn't the guy that got killed and thrown in a coffin turn into a zombie? How come much of the time the dialogue doesn't match the actors' mouths? There are many more, just watch and make a game of finding all the nonsense.

The one shred of respectability in the entire film is the opening 15 minutes. The reason? Tom Savini. The town's previous zombie outbreak is shown to set up the rest of the movie. Savini plays a former cop turned survivalist enlisted to help deal it. What a tease. There's this big group of people hunting down and exterminating patches of zombies. Lots of guns, a helicopter, high production value kinda stuff. Then Tom Savini is gone and so is any hope for a good flick. Ramsey noted that the beginning works largely because it was only after this portion was filmed that Wolf went on her destructive rampage.

So who do blame? Was it an arrogant producer's daughter who killed a potentially decent flick? Or was it just a combination of bad writing, bad acting, bad directing, and bad producing all coming together? Regardless of whose fault it is, COTLD is a pointless waste of time.",1212796800,13,3037,4.6585820895522385

1. a stupid, unbelievable story.

2. WRETCHED acting, and i mean dismal folks.

3. lame special effects, what few there are.

4. a terrible soundtrack, if you want to call it that.

1634645,1,B00005NKUN,"As a rule, smart people who are familiar with Amazon's ""customer"" reviews quickly learn to pour a bag of rock salt over most of the single-starred ones; on the other hand, when they total over half the number of a title's reviews, it's now exception-to-the-rule time.  In the case of CHILDREN Of The LIVING DEAD, consider those 1-starred reviews as reliable as Lindsay Lohan's next meltdown.

Why do I loathe CHILDREN Of The LIVING DEAD?  You tell me...

-Disjointed plot: The movie opens in the middle of a zombie holocaust where, for some inexplicable reason, children are sitting around unharmed and smiling.  Jumping 14 years ahead, the townspeople seem to have forgotten everything that's happened. Plot holes like this are all over the place: One moment its hordes of undead, the next it's unscrupulous used car salesmen, then we have the corpse of a serial killer looking for the teenagers who broke beer bottles on the grave of his dear departed mother--who used to force him as a child to dress as girl (yes, just like that movie, Psycho)!

-No direction: Several times in the movie people are told that zombies can only be destroyed by a bullet to the brain, yet several of them clearly get taken out by body shots.  Then there is the pack of rabid zombies who stop short of a diner's large windows, where they calm down to glide their hands over the glass.  What was up with that?  And, of course, we have the 6-shot revolvers firing 8 or 9 times.

-Deception: Although he is only in the beginning 10 minutes, Tom Savini gets top billing.  Savini was the only reason I chose to watch this garbage.

-Amateurish makeup: The zombie serial killer looks like he's wearing a mask bought from a dollar store, while his nose and hands grow with each scene.  Any movie ""starring"" Tom Savini, one of the greatest makeup artists in the business and an FX legend, should never have such low grade makeup/FX.

Savini should've walked off the set, I then never would've watched this garbage.  It would've been a better world for us all.

To call CHILDREN Of The LIVING DEAD a bad movie is giving it undeserved praise.

The contents in the seat of a bum's pants have more worth than this movie.

I don't want to give it any stars.

So, if you are thinking of purchasing or renting this DVD don't just take my word for it, feel free to read the 54 out of 80 other negative reviews.  You'll thank me later.",1208822400,36,2401,4.565420560747664
1634646,1,B00005NKUN,"Children of the Living Dead (Tor Ramsey, 2001)

Oh, how could you? Three of the principals from the original Night of the Living Dead-- John Russo (who produced), William Hinzman (cinematographer; his daughter appears in the film), and Tom Savini (who stars)-- came together to create this godawful offshoot of Romero's pictures, if offshoot it can be called. I'm not even going to offer you a plot summary on this one; the offenses to canon are even worse here than those in Day of the Dead 2: Contagium. Karen Wolf's script should have been published, as Melville once put it, only to the flames. Some of the acting is competent; most, to be kind, is not. Ramsey's direction is okay some of the time, terrible some of the time. (To be fair, it seems much of the problem lay with Wolf and Russo; according to IMDB, they lorded many crew hiring decisions over him, as well as recutting the final film without any input from him at all.) Technically, the film's a mess; the lighting and soundtrack are horribly inconsistent, the makeup is awful (how on earth did Tom Savini make this movie and have nothing to do with the makeup? Brilliant move, guys), the special effects are, shall we say, not so special. Avoid this one unless you need a reason to throw things at, or through, your TV. *",1207008000,15,1289,4.58008658008658

1634651,5,B00005NKUN,"I didn't expect very much when I picked up ""Children of the Living Dead"" from a supermarket's bargain DVD area. Was I ever pleasantly surprised!! I have seen much bigger budgeted horror films, with big-name casts that were far less entertaining than this film is. It is true that the acting is pretty much sub-par and sometimes even quite cheesy, but it tends to lend an unexpected touch of humor to the film, making it perhaps unintentionally campy at times. My main two complaints about the film are the limited role of Tom Savini, despite being given top-billing and his being the most interesting character in the film and also the idea of the ""master zombie"", ""Abbot Hayes"". It would have been much better to simply have had the dead start to rise and attack the living than to try to pinpoint one character that was the cause of it all happening. This worked very well in ""Night of the Living Dead"", where they never really explained what was causing the whole thing, but simply raised the question of the failed Venus probe space mission which may have been responsible. I really liked the young girl Laurie (played by Jamie McCoy), who was the waitress at Dave's Diner. She was the film's ""nice"" girl and I was also quite surprised at the film's lack of nudity and sex scenes. One more complaint though, the ending is somewhat abrupt and inconclusive, as it just leaves you hanging and wondering how it is all resolved. Still, although far from perfect, I can highly recommend it to zombie film fans. Not overly gory, but the make-up effects are excellent. The music by Alan Howarth also is quite good and adds much atmosphere to the film. Also, it really doesn't ""look"" like a low budget film, especially as I was simply just expecting it to be a shot on video cheapie, made for and released straight to cable t.v. and video markets. It is well worth a look, especially as it can usually be had for a song. It is really a fun film to watch!!",1129766400,7,1950,4.542613636363637

Hell, they might be a bit cheeky and try and throw in the Return Of The Living Dead series to cash in. They might be absolutley EVIL and attempt to put this terrible, TERRIBLE movie on an innocent, unsuspecting public.

I presume you know a fair bit about zombies, otherwise you, you know, wouldn't be on here reading about one. OK, so I'll skip the basics and tell you one of the ""plot"" details.

A master zombie HIDES from kids, watching them and plotting. Oh yeah, and he turns CORPSES into zombies. Exactly.

Diabolocal acting we can handle (and oh maaaan, it's in abundace here), rubbish effects (ditto) but at least get the BASIC characteristics of zombies right. Hell, Tom Savini's in this (he must have been really broke), you think he of all people would have said, ""uh.. you know, guys.. this whole movie is really awful"".

If there is one thing you should see this for, it's for the unintentionally HILARIOUS moment the master zombie Abbot Hayes stalks out onto the middle of the road. Honestly, it's the FUNNIEST thing you'll ever see. He walks like a Thunderbirds puppet. It really is the shoddiest, worst excuse for ""horror"" you'll ever, EVER see. And that includes the Ring 2.

OVERALL: Overall I liked this movie, and its not like alot of people say it is. Tom Savini ruled in like the first 10 mins of the movie killin zombies. If your a big zombie movie fan check this out.",1114473600,,775,4.167785234899329

I think people would know that, if it were to be..on the cover it would say George Romero's Children Of The Living Dead, and it doesnt, does it? So obviously its not. Sure, this movie was horrible in the horror/thriller category..and I admit i was expecting something a little better, but all the same this movie wasn't as bad as everyone is making it out to sound. It is actually pretty funny, the characters lack so much depth, and their acting skills are so horrible it is just so funny when people get scared, or try to run away from the zombies. Anyhow...if you can't find any good movies..pick this one up..sure its not scary..and u won't gain anything from it..and you will forget it easily..but this movie is just to funny to miss out on, it should be Scary Movie 4 if you ask me.",1114214400,,922,4.429411764705883

I definatly love this movie, so if people can just get their minds off the whole fact that ""this is supposed to be scary"" than they might actually like the movie because of how funny it is.

Now I have and can honestly say that Children of the Living Dead SUCKS! Why is it so bad? Because they didn't even try on any level. They just figured they could make a buck off the ""Living Dead"" label. It even seems like they screwed not only us but also Savini, Russo, Hinzman, and everybody involved. The folks in charge of this abortion clearly didn't care one bit about the movie or the audience. They just wanted quick cash at the expense of everything and everybody.

Our main man, ass kickin, zombie shooting Tom Savini is here doing what he does best: Killing Zombies.  Unfortunatly he dies in the first 10 min.  Jump ahead 10 years later, and Super Zombie Abbot (Disco Fever) Hayes is scaring kids and knocking model VW vans off of a mini cliff. Jump ahead another year and Hayes is back at it, terrorizing all five people in the town.  That's it, that's the plot.  Bad Make-up, bad acting, bad story/script, GOOD FUN FOR ALL FANS OF THE GENRE! Ed Wood couldn't have made this movie more cheesy. I recommend watching it as if a bunch of your friends made this movie in a weekend, get drunk and laugh at them.

If I had to sum up my feelings after watching this film it would be; raped. Thats how I felt, if you want this feeling buy this film, you won't regret it for an instant, not until you try to watch it. In fact, the sleeve design will probably frustrate you so you'll be disapointed even earlier than that. In fact this film is so bad the post man would probably break your letter box whilst delivering it, and several injuries would have occured in the sorting office whilst it was there, the film is that cursed. A fox used to visit my garden at night for food; it hasn't been back since i bought this film. My girlfriend broke up with me after watching this.

1634718,3,B00005NKUN,"I think the budget for this movie must have been about $100, because for a movie made just a few years ago, you expect much more in the effects department. Really, the entire movie is quite laughable. There is a mysterious ""head"" zombie - Abott Hayes - who pops up at random points in the movie, and who apparently has control over his hoard of zombies...And he has little kids locked up in a barn...Or something, I actually forget because I tried to repress the lunacy from my mind. But really, it doesn't make much sense. The story and plot is insane.
The effects aren't horrible, but they're definately no competition to the effects of ""Day of the Dead."" This isn't a very gorey flick either, some blood here and there, but not enough people get killed for this to be packed with gore. Notable appearance by Tom Savini, who doesn't do the effects, but instead offers a cameo as a kickass zombie hunter at the beginning of the film. I think his short-lived scene was the most excellent and exciting, and it's too bad he didn't play a main character throughout the flick. And WHY did they have Tom Savini in their movie and NOT make him do the effects!? Plotholes aside, it could have been a better movie with greater effects.
Yet I say all this in an endearing way. I think this is the perfect movie to watch if you're bored out of your mind and need something to do. It really is good for a laugh, especially if you're a zombie movie buff and like to point out any flaws that you see in a movie. 3 Stars for the beginning scene with Savini and helping me ease slightly out of boredom on a rainy afternoon.

1634749,1,B00005NKUN,"Children of the Living Dead is an awful, low budget zombie film that is about, well, the living dead.  It opens with a zombie plague being crushed completely by humans.  However, one zombie escapes destruction and (after the film jumps ahead in time) ends up causing the demise of some snotty teens.  The film then commits the cardinal sin of cinema of jumping ahead YET AGAIN in time and now we're treated to a car dealer wanting to build his car lot on top of a graveyard.  Because the lone zombie is more of a vengeful ghost/killer than an instinct-driven flesh-eater from Dawn of the Dead, he starts reanimating more bodies to stop this.  This film is extremely dull, has AWFUL ""acting"", and an extremely small budget which shows painfully throughout the movie.  (I'd guess only a film shot by a teen armed with a camcorder in his backyard could have any lower of a budget.)  One can only guess why Tom Savini decided to be in this dog of a film.

1634750,1,B00005NKUN,"People want more zombies so they made Children of the Living Dead. That makes sense. Tom Savini is a genre favorite and make-up artist, he's worked on such films as the original Dawn of the Dead,directed the NOTLD remake, and he has fans who follow his work. His involvement in Children of the Living Dead makes sense. Bill Hinzman played the cemetary zombie in NOTLD, he reprised that role in the fun Flesh Eater, he has fans who appreciate him, and he worked behind the camera on The Crazies. Having him involved in COTLD is another sensible move. John Russo wrote the original NOTLD, provided the story for Return of the Living Dead, and Russo's inclusion on COTLD makes sense too. Savini, Hinzman, and Russo. That's a knock-out combo, but it didn't turn out that way. COTLD is an abomination. It's a total mess and a waste of time and talent.
  Say what you like about the 30th Anniversary Edition of NOTLD, but its major fault is that most of the added footage advanced a new plot that doesn't fit at all. None of the Rev Hicks stuff should have been put into NOTLD, but since they were determined to make a sequel they could have taken the mishandled ideas from the 30th Anniversary Edition and expanded on them so they'd make more sense. They could have had Savini handle the make-up or direct, let Russo write the damn thing (the 30th Anniversry Edition shows he's at least got an idea), and hell give Bill a chance to be a zombie again. Why not bring in Debbie Rochon too?All of that would have made some degree of sense, but instead Savini wasn't paid to handle the make-up or direct, Hinzman's beloved zombie was kept off screen, and Russo isn't the writer. Even Santa Claws is entertaining straight to video fare, but not COTLD. They went with a director who is unknown, and a writer that never wrote a horror movie of note, and somebody edited the film together in the most incoherent manner possible! ALL THE LINES ARE DUBBED AWFULLY TOO! None of this makes one bit of sense. The three guys who have entertained us in the past are almost completely left out of the loop.

This film attempts to link itself to the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (for shame) as some type of undead child molester (WTF?) keeps bringing back zombies. The camera work is awful and I challenge you to find a movie with worse acting and dialouge. To its credit, the opening fifteen minutes featuring Tom Savini are actually pretty good but once he bites it so does the movie.
Unless, you are the type who like to laugh at bad movies (which I am), you should avoid this one. If you are a fan of bad movies, this is guaranteed good times though it's not quite on the level with such classics as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER.",1059436800,2,850,4.31875

The rest of the movie is based around some cockamamey story about some guy named Abbott Hays who killed a lot of people however many years ago and he's still be alive and eating dead people which brings them back to life as zombies which are, after all, required to make this an actual zombie movie and so on and so forth, etc., etc., blah blah blah.

It fell knowwhere near as good as any of the original living dead triology.  However, Abbot Hayes nonwithstanding it portrays what I feel would have been a more realistic version of what would have happened.  Zombies most likely would not have taken over as they did in dawn and day.  The acting in this was pretty bad.  And Savini's ""crouching tiger, hidden redneck"" character was just put in so the man could live out his action hero fantasies.  Now on to Abbot Hayes.  What was he, a magical zombie?  He had super strength.  Zombies in the living dead series don't have super strength.  And his hands, those were faked really bad.  I've seen better fake rubber hands in the local stores halloween department.  If George Romero had had a hand in it I'm sure the movie would have been better.
Good points include...  hold on a sec, I'm sure I can think of one... give me a sec I can do this...  Oh yeah, other than Abbot Hayes the rest of the zombie make up wasn't too bad.

1634784,1,B00005NKUN,"Upon first impression ""Children of the living dead"" looks like it has been produced by a couple of children who managed to convince their neighbours and friends to star in an unofficial sequel to the ""living dead"" series. However after a few moments have passed (and very slowly I might add) sudden realisation dawns that this is far worse than any living children could produce and eventually you're convinced that this must have been produced by people as brainless and primitive as the living dead themselves. Initially the script seemed to show some merit and I was beginning to feel it was just marred by the talentless people involved however it soon tops the list as one of the films major faults. On the acting front it is devoid of any memorable performances and even poor Tom Savini appears to have realised just how bad this production was and decided to just phone his performance in. The editing is choppy and atrocious and the word continuity seems to be missing from the directors vocabulary. Alan Howarth's score (a former collaborator with John Carpenter) soon becomes tedious and after a while you can tell he either bailed from producing fresh music for the project or they just couldn't afford him any more when his score from Halloween 4 & 5 appears throughout the last half of the movie. The only saving grace is the special Make-up f/x which although not always great (the lead zombie Abbot Hayes looks like an over-exaggerated scoobie Doo zombie) at the majority of times remind you of the excellent Zombies that Tom Savini created for ""DAWN"" and ""DAY"". On that note The producers of the original Living Dead series should be ashamed that this inbreed of the excellent originals (including the 1990 remake) should ever have been released in the first place and upon viewing the credits it appears that the producer Joseph Wolf has used the ""living dead"" name in shame as an outlet for his daughter Karen Lee Wolf to produce such uninspired drivel...some people have more money than sense and I probably should include myself in that statement for wasting mine on this thrash, although it did make me laugh out loud more than once;) If you're looking for a more modern, clever take, well acted and original spin-off on the Zombie and Living dead genre, my advice is to check out the special DVD release for ""The dead hate the living"" which in my opinion, for a low budget shocker, definitely set my taste buds on fire.",1016928000,14,2441,4.745882352941177

 This little film sits rather nicely with the heavy-handed hack job Russo and cohorts committed on their re-release of the 30th Anniversary edition of Night of The Living Dead back in '98. And shame on Anchor Bay, by the way, for having anything to do with that blasphemous spit in the eye to all self respecting fans of the original film. Then again, that's another story...

Agreeably, the first ten minutes or so of Children of the Living Dead is rather entertaining. After all, how often does one get treated to Tom Savini ""zombie bashing"" outside of Dawn of the Dead. But as an earlier reviewer noted, after Savini is taken out, the film quickly degenerates into a farcical Ed Woodish rampage. The head zombie is a character named Abbot Hayes (move over Bub, here's something dumber!). Mid-way through the film he appears as more of a troll in a tux than a zombie, complete with pointed ears and elongated Nosferatu finger extensions. From what I can make out, he's some kind of jumped-up Zombie Master and has the ability to raise more undead via some sort of ""evil resonance"".

One of the best moments in the film is Children's version of the now clich ""shoot em in the head speech"". This segment is immediately followed by the same bunch of rednecks, who just received the speech, bum-rushing a horde of undead waiting outside the diner and utterly neglecting to use their guns for a good part of the battle ... choosing to mainly fire them in the air and yell ""yee-haw"". Fabulous!
I can say with confidence, that all of you misled dummies out there, who think Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead actually fits within the Romero Dead Trilogy, will most assuredly add Children of the Living Dead to your already confused mythos.

As a side note, it should come as no surprise that Return was originally scripted by Russo, but O'Bannon actually made a fun film out of it. So you can see Russo was at it as early as the 80's. The really sad part of Children, as well as the extra footage Russo added into the 30th Anniversary edition of Night, is his desperate attempt to rewrite the mythology Romero has since created for the series.

After their split following the original Night ... Russo had legal use of ""Living Dead"" whilst Romero would use ""Dead"".  For anyone who has had the misfortune of enduring any of Russo's pitiful work following the original Dead film back in '68, you can see why he's trying so hard to grasp at some form of income by capitalizing on Romero's Living Dead craze. He's still trying to hang onto the Venus Probe explanation for the dead returning to life (being one of his original screenplay ideas from Night).

So in conclusion, Children of the Living Dead is not something to be taken serious by any stretch of the imagination. By all means, if you still want this film, its a wonderful addition to any ""Turkey Collection"". Hell, it should get the Turkey Crown as far as I am concerned. At least its more exciting than Ghosts That Still Walk. You're assured a good laugh, especially if you give it the Mystery Science Theater treatment with a group of buddies. On this merit alone I've given it a rating of two stars, just for the laugh factor.",1016668800,4,3441,4.558252427184466

It's not a sequel to the original Living Dead trilogy, but it DOES try to make you think that it is, mentioning how everything started with the Venus Probe crashing to earth and releasing radiation...The film starts out good, though obviously cheap, with Tom Savini kicking butt. His sherriff sidekick unfortunately gives away the fact that Tom is going to be the only good actor in the bunch. Everyone else is awful. The camera work is terrible too! What's with all those close-ups?! These actors were waaaay too unattractive for all those extreme close-ups. The zombies looked pretty lame too, but radiation zombies are among the few things that scare me so I still found them a bit creepy. The head zombie didn't seem all that intelligent to me, except when you consider how long he had remained hidden somehow. There wasn't really any point to his character though. And as for the plot, well, it was practically nonexistent. It goes like this: The film starts out several years ago. Tom Savini is killing zombies, he finds a bunch of kids in a barn, sends them away, and is killed in the barn by a zombie who was once a psychotic serial killer. The zombie kills Savini. End of all chances of this movie being good. We are taken into modern day, when the kids are young adults. Apparently only one of them has any memory of the existence of zombies. While the film throws hints here and there that it is somehow related to the classic film Night of the Living Dead, it clearly is NOT a sequel. In this film the zombie incidents have been neatly covered up. As a matter of fact, it even seemed to try and link itself to the Return of the Living Dead movies, mentioning an attack in the '80's as well. Anyway, the zombie plague returns now, since the serial killer/zombie has been hiding ever since, and has decided now is the time to start infecting again. This might have been enough of a plot, except that some mess about a car dealership gets mixed in too, and sort of messes everything up. It's all pretty stupid. I can't say the atmosphere was hopeless, the low budget and cheap quality of it all could have added some horror if the script and acting had been good. Let's not forget how good some other cheap horror films have been in the past, such as the original NOTLD. So as for the good and bad of this film, Tom Savini's small part, the potential that was there before anyone started writing or filming or acting, and the mixing in of an Ed Gein type character were all good.

The first part of the film follows random characters who all die, then we jump ahead a few years, then follow some more characters and they all die and then we jump ahead a few years and so on. We are one hour into the movie before it finally settles on some meaningless story about a guy building a dealership.
There is absolutely no story or plotline from one scene to the next, no character development or structure. If they had made it all up as they went along it couldn't have been this bad.
The dialogue is the most laughably atrocious first-grade drivel I have ever heard. I can't tell if the acting is bad or not as the actors are struggling to get through the horrible writing. The writer Karen Lee Wolf gave herself single card credit as Producer, and as Writer plus made a cameo in yet another meaningless scene. Why anyone would give Karen Wolf money for her script is beyond me, (oh yeah!) except that the Executive Producer's last name is 'Wolf'.
Worst of all was that they added in dialogue over most of the scenes, adding dialogue which looked different than that recorded on location, so it looks like a Godzilla movie.
The camerawork is okay, but its the lighting that is so bad---flat in most places, or with night scenes lit up like Shea stadium.
The makeup effects are fine, similar to DAY OF THE DEAD but they way they are lit is horrible, at one point it looks like they are shining flashlights in the zombie's faces. Not sure if Karen Wolf was operating camera but from the looks of it I wouldn't doubt it.
Lousy almost nonexistent music and edited together horribly with no rhyme or reason or sense of coherency.

The story then takes you 15 years into the future and it took me all of five minutes to come to the conclusion that this is an amateur movie at best. I know nothing of any of the actors or the director, but this MUST be their first movie. The only thing I liked in what little I watched was the lead zombie, Abbot Hayes. I thought he was pretty cool looking, but he was more gruesome than scary. Maybe if I watch the entire thing there might eventually be a plot, but I doubt it.

1634837,1,B00005NKUN,"WHY? This is the question I asked myself after viewing the UK release of this travesty of a movie (actually, home movie is more apt). ""Director"" Tor Ramsey needs to be fed to one of his own zombies after making this awful excuse, and what is it with the terrible script? Maybe George Romero needs to have a word with his old NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD partners, and tell them to stop ruining the name of that cult classic.
The thought of Tom Savini appearing (in a very minor role) bolstered my hopes, but after seeing him act like he was still in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN only left me more depressed. The special effects aren't very special, the cinematography is dull and lifeless (no pun intended) and the acting is appalling. Actually, I don't know if the acting is that bad, it may just be the way the film has been shot and edited together, thus not really giving the actors much help at all.
However, all in all the movie is unwatchable. I sat down three times to try and sit through it, only giving up the final time as life is too short to watch amateur dreck like this. I just can't believe talented people like Tom Savini (who actually did outstanding work in DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD, and created some of the most interesting effects work in the 80s) would lend their names to such drivel.
I heard recently that they're remaking DAWN OF THE DEAD (hello, bad move anyone?), if you have to do that, please don't hire Tor Ramsey to do it. After this major disgrace of a movie, I wouldn't trust this guy to direct traffic . . . I just hope 'ol George Romero is watching and laughing to himself somewhere in Pittsburgh.

1634838,1,B00005NKUN,"Children of the Living Dead is a film that deserves to go down in history...and flames.  With makeup effects rivaling only the most innovative of grade-school musicals, and dialogue dubbing that is matched in futility only by the most obscure chinese kung-fu films, this blatant attempt to cash in on the Romero legacy with the least expense (and apparently, talent) possible is a disgrace to both film, the DVD format, and the western world.  Upon only a cursory examination of the film, it is obvious that the production cost less than your average 1974 Dodge Dart.  The plot seems to have been structured using a Magic 8-ball, while the film has been edited so as to maximize the confusion and exasperation of the audience.  Decades pass with no evident aging of the actors, sets, or relative environment.  The only obvious attraction inherent in the project is Tom Savini, who appears (after losing a bet, hopefully) and manages to extricate himself from this obscenity of a film in under 15 minutes.  However, also not to be missed are the obviously two-dimensional tombstones, the clips falling out of weapons while in mid-firing, and the amazing mixture of night and daylight shots...in the same scenes.  The only bright spot is the swaggering, Travolta-like movement of the ""head zombie"" who resembles an extra from the ""Thriller"" video, complete with bad '80's wardrobe. In truth, no words can express just how bad this movie is. Ed Wood himself is probably spinning in his grave right now, realizing that he had barely plumbed the depths of bad filmmaking which have been charted anew by...this piece of crap.

1634839,1,B00005NKUN,"Last night I watched ""CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD"", the new zombie movie supposedly ""starring"" Tom Savini...
I enjoyed the first 5 minutes wherein Savini was actually in the movie. At first I thought we had a nice tribute to Romero's vision on our hands. After Savini gets killed off 5 minutes into the proceedings, the film takes a severe nosedive. It makes one wonder if Savini had been giving some helpful film-making hints to the director during his brief time on the set.
Words cannot even begin to describe what an abomination this movie is... but here's the first clue: The same production team responsible for the reprehensible NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 30th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (the one where they CHANGED the soundtrack and ADDED NEWLY SHOT FOOTAGE(!!!) to the 1968 classic.)
The film itself tries to combine the walking-dead motif with a sort of Ed Gein like character (The supposed ""intelligent"" zombie, Abbott Hayes). It's a story combination that doesn't really work... it just doesn't make any dang sense at all.
The dialogue is unbelievably stupid. It was so bad I searched the credits for the writer, just to see if it was Russo... no writer was listed (surprise!). Someone actually gets credit though for coming up with a character that's a rip-off of a real-life ghoul (Ed Gein)... not to mention a character that's been done to death (no pun intended) i.e.: Texas Chainsaw, Psycho, Deranged, 3 on a Meathook, etc. etc. etc...
The zombies looked O.K.... and I mean JUST O.K. The gore was O.K. and I mean JUST O.K. There were no real scares and many of the scenes just didn't make any sense... for example: one scene that takes place in a VW bus, totally ripping off Texas Chainsaw, where the teenagers talk about how ""dead people don't just get up and walk around"". It's later revealed that one of the teenagers involved in that conversation witnessed a zombie attack as a child... it's as if the writers just weren't even paying attention to what they had already written... it's as if they were just making the movie up as they went along.
The ""hero"" of the film is an annoying yuppie frat guy. Guys like that are supposed TO GET KILLED in movies like this!!!
The whole thing seems as if they had one guy wanting to make a zombie movie and one guy wanting to make an Ed Gein movie and so they just threw the two together with no rhyme or reason.
BE AWARE: THIS FILM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GEORGE ROMERO'S CLASSIC ZOMBIE FLICKS. DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO THINKING THAT TOM SAVINI REALLY HAS MUCH OF ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOVIE... He's in it for like 5 minutes.
If you want a good zombie movie look for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (not the ""30th Anniversary edition"" though), DAWN OF THE DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD, ZOMBIE (Lucio Fulci), THE BEYOND, CEMETERY MAN, heck... even DR. BUTCHER M.D. is better than this garbage!",1003536000,,2833,4.6118811881188115

It was a shiny door.  The cameramzan was smiling.  Not just for that truck but for 4 trucks where you could see the crew clearly in every door).

Former Deputy Hughs, a veteran zombie killer, and a gang of Rambo survivalist types are killing them off on foot until a helicopter arrives at the scene for reinforcement against the dwindling number of dead walkers.

An old barn needs to be cleared as the invasion is coming to an end. Hughs and Deputy Randolph enter the building. Hughs finds and rescues a group of young children whore locked in a cage with no other living adults to be found. As the children are escorted out, little Laurie looks up into the entryway to the second story. Hughs asks her whats wrong, while also ordering Deputy Randolph (whos pretty nonchalant about the whole situation) to evacuate and protect the children as he begins to climb the stairs. After reaching the upper floor, he kills off a few zombies but then encounters something he never expected.

Thirty years later the rescued children are now grown. Many of them who were rescued from the barn are on their way to see a concert. While riding along in a Volkswagen van, they're talking about Abbott Hayes, a convicted rapist and murderer who was also murdered while serving time in prison. As the group passes by the old barn from where they were rescued many years earlier, they stop to desecrate the grave of Abbott Hayes mother, who's buried along the road. One of the men then spots the building, gets spooked and tells the others they need to leave. The barn, still abandoned, appears not to have aged a single day and something still lurks inside.

7947378,1,B00005NKUN,"Night of the Living Dead (1968) was one of the first modern Horror Films that changed everything
the downside of the film with everything going on while making the film nobody thought to put a copyright on the film
so one of the most influential Horror Films ever is in public domain
The two writers of NOTLD are  George A. Romero and John A. Russo

The two would part ways and make there own films

Romero going on to doing a insanely amount of various work from Martin, Knightriders, The Crazies, and continue his  chapters in his dead films with Dawn Day, etc.

Russo on the other hand was hit and miss mostly miss he did bring the original Return of the Living Dead script/story around to studios
Dan O'Bannon  overhauled/ re-wrote  the film in the end John A. Russo hated the final product we got with Return of the Living Dead
Russo also put out the dishonest Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition just to cash in on NOTLD Fans
so John Russo's track record is sleazy and shady at best

Children of the Living Dead is yet another example of Russo trying to make a quick buck of the Living Dead namesake
The idea/concept of Children of the Living Dead is actually a interesting idea but, something went horribly wrong
the funny thing about this flick everyone involved in someway blames someone else to why
The finished product ended up so terrible
If everyone knew it was such a train wreck why was it even released films get held more then we know
Nobody would've ever known about this
But, around 2000 with Zombies gaining major steam in video games and the home video market
the financiers wanted to make there money back any way they could
the budget was $500,000  i don't see it
everything looks so cheap the f/x, the way the teenagers die at the start is like a bad Naked Gun parody scene
It's like this film was only made to wash money (if you know what i mean!)
the audio mix is terrible nothing works
It's like they dug up Ed Wood and made his corpse shoot this film!
For one the edits are flat out terrible
There is Nothing and I mean nothing redeeming  about this film it's pointless and worthless
No Nudity! No Gore! No Real Plot

This is hands down one of the worst horror films/zombies films I've ever seen and i've seen a lot of Zombie films between Zombie Doom,  Zombie Lake, Zombie Strippers,  and the countless other
Every copy of this should be recycled they have no real purpose to be here other then collect dust and mock Romero, Fulci &  O'Bannon Legacy 1/10",1442361600,,2498,4.425764192139738
7947379,3,B00005NKUN,"Like '88 Flesh Eater, this Bill Hinzman lensed muncher has a definite '68 NotLD vibe going on. Tom Savini is in great form in front of the camera once again; he sets the tone for a fun ride start to finish. With horror vets Nicotera, Survinski, and Heidi Hinzman also along for the ride, what's not to like? Recommended!",1436054400,,320,4.440677966101695

7947381,1,B00005NKUN,"The rumors are true.  Everything you have probably heard about this movie is true.  Tom Savini is a ventriloquist...Abbot Hayes(looking more goblin than zombie) funk shuffles across the road, causing the kids to drive their van off a cliff...One of the cops has a bizarre birthmark that looks like a pigeon took a dump on him and he was too lazy to wipe it off...One of the townsfolk has a problem with both dynamite and physics...The acting is a step below porn...The movie was seemingly edited by a deranged person, same goes for the dubbing...Hey camera guy I can see your reflection...The director did make a post apologizing for this movie and we now know who is responsible for this mess...I could go on but you get the picture.  This is the type of awfulness the comes around once, maybe twice in a lifetime.  1 star if judged as an actual work of art in the medium of film.  5 stars if you are looking to laugh your ass off at the epic display of ineptness in the medium of film.  Waitress?  Refill please...",1407369600,,1016,4.489130434782608
