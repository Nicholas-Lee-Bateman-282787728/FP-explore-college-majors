8153833,5,B000K15W20,"For me, this replaces the outdated ""NOVA: Human Origins"".  ""Secrets of the Dead"" is ALWAYS a good show, with great science.  This one makes Human Origins easy to understand, and discusses controversies well.  It includes Lucy (3.2 million year old Australopithecus) and focuses on Orrorin (6 million year old hominid).",1179273600,3,318,5.32
