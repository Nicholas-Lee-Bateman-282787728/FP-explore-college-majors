3447915,4,B001AGXE8S,"The stories on this DVD included the annunciation, the nativity, the birth of John the Baptist, the baptism of Jesus, the feeding of the 5,000, Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, Jacob and Esau, and more. While the characters did not directly quote scripture, the paraphrase was generally close enough to be familiar and there was not a lot of extraneous material in the stories. For example, no one told Mary or Elizabeth that her baby was cute.

I realized when I requested the DVD that this wasn't likely to be a high-budget Disney-like presentation. However, even given that lack of expectation, I found some of the animation jerky and not well-coordinated with the sound. However, even though they were relatively simple, I think the illustrations did a good job of tellig the story being narrated.

Of course with a cartoon presentation like this, Mom's opinion is only part of the equation. The intended audience is somewhat younger than I am, so I am please to report that my four year old likes the DVD and has requested it several times. I guess it succeeded at its mission.

Since the DVD sticks pretty much to scripture to tell the story, rather than interpreting it, I didn't see anything that should give a Catholic parent pause; though the publisher is not Catholic.",1236297600,,1272,4.7727272727272725
3447916,5,B001AGXE8S,"My children and I, had the pleasure of viewing the ""Read and Share DVD Bible - Volume 1"".  This dvd contains 13 stories from the Old and New Testament.  It begins with the Six days of Creation and ends with One lost sheep.  Each segment is about 3 minutes long.  Although the story is quick, the pertinent facts from the bible are presented in each segment.  The animation is colorful and sticks to the original illustrations from the Read and Share Bible.  However, it draws a kid's attention to the stories on screen.  This dvd was viewed by my 7year old and 3 year old, and both enjoyed the dvd.  The stories are presented in a fun kid friendly manner. My children were excited to be learning about the bible in a unique way.  Rather than me just reading the stories to them, they were watching them brought to life on the dvd.  I would not recommend using the dvd as a child's only source of bible teaching.  However, combining the bible with the stories will help reinforce the concepts for a child.  My oldest son, wanted to learn more about the people he watched on the dvd.  This provides me a direction for our nightly bible reading.  I can focus on stories that appealed to him, and he will want to listen.  I look forward to more Read and Share DVD's. These would also be great for Vacation Bible School or Sunday School lessons.",1235952000,,1340,4.412244897959184

The DVD's most selling quality is its alignment with scripture. Each segment is approximately three minutes, and ideal for the target audience's attention span. Of course, due to necessary time constraints, not every aspect of every story is presented. It is flexible and easy to navigate for home or church setting. The animation is clean and attractive and has a soothing instrumental accompaniment. Unlike many of its counterparts, the Read & Share Bible DVD is not high pitched, busy, or annoying. Quite the opposite.

Although the graphics are not as animated and busy as most movies these days, it really was very good for getting the kids to follow the story and bring something away from the movie.  I would recommend this video for all young kids and it would make a great addition to the Read and Share Bible that this is based upon.

There is also bonus material such as printable coloring pages that my kids really enjoy.  I always am a proponent for Bible-based material in today's times and this is such a good one to add to your collection!",1249862400,,805,4.326666666666667

3447922,3,B001AGXE8S,"I received The Read and Share DVD Bible Volume 1 from Thomas Nelson Publishers to review. This DVD is a collection of 13 stories from the Bible. It's aimed at young children. These stories are told through 3 minute animated clips with mostly narration. Some of the stories included are Adam & Eve, The Flood, and the birth of Jesus.

I sat down to watch it with my 21 month old and my 12 year old. I thought this would be great for my toddler since he loves Veggie Tales. But, he got bored very quickly. Every once in a while he would come back to look at it, but mostly he played with something else. The animation is fairly simple and it's not really exciting. It has a musical underscore, but nothing to sing and dance to like the stuff he is used to. My older son watched the whole thing and thought it was boring.

I realize my older son is really too old for this kind of DVD and maybe my youngest is too young. I think a good way to use this would be in addition to a Bible reading on that particular story. After reading the Bible story aloud, the story could be played on DVD. I may try this when my son is a little older and can understand better.",1242172800,6,1157,4.115044247787611
3447923,3,B001AGXE8S,"My 33-month-old enjoyed the ""Read and Share DVD Bible"" overall. During the parts of massive narration and minimal animation action, he left the room and gave his attention elsewhere. He would always come back and then sit for awhile. I could tell that the graphics were enough to grab him, but their hold wasn't as strong as main-stream animation. I know he is only 33 months, but the plot wasn't always clear to him because of such heavy reliance on narration. I also realize that narration is the easiest way (and possibly the most appropriate way) to convey God interacting with His creation, however the plot becomes unclear to a kid due to such narration. Also, when narration is used to convey emotions and motivations, the plot's movement is unclear to a kid. In regards to the content, I am not sure what made you choose the stories you did while leaving others out. I realize that these stories have appropriate content for young kids, but since we are telling our children a cohesive, continuous narrative of God interacting with His image bearers, it seems like the video contributes to making the children familiar with that narrative while not making the narrative cohesive or continuous to them. (Note: I do realize that this DVD is a supplement to Bible reading, which is great, and to us training our own children in the way of the Lord well, but the continuity question will still arise in my opinion.)",1241568000,,1419,4.748987854251012
3447924,4,B001AGXE8S,"I finally had a chance to review the Read and Share DVD Bible from Thomas Nelson. Here are 13 stories from the Bible told in a gentle and loving way by the various narrators. The background music is so soothing that I found myself nodding off a bit but that's probably because it was Sunday afternoon. Children from babies up to about five years old will enjoy hearing the stories from the Old and New Testament. The stories are told in such a way that children will probably understand scripture better than some adults. I especially like the Story of Noah with all the animals of the world pairing up two by two for the voyage of forty days and nights. I got a sense of the enormous task poor old Noah took on to please God. I also like ""Mary's Big Surprise"" about when the angel came down to give her the news she was going to be pregnant with the son of God. What a dilemma! How would she say yes to God and explain the news to her husband to be, Joseph? Good thing Joseph also got a visit from an angel or he might have been an real angry man. I am looking forward to sharing this DVD with my grandson and would heartily recommend it to parents and grandparents of young children.",1241481600,,1185,4.224669603524229
3447925,2,B001AGXE8S,"This DVD has thirteen bible stories (cartoons) designed to be watched (and enjoyed) by preschoolers. Eight stories are taken from the Old Testament--all from the book of Genesis to be exact. Five stories are from the New Testament--from the gospels.

These cartoon bible stories are based on the popular Read and Share Bible by Gwen Ellis. I would imagine--though I haven't fully looked at the book--that the book is more enjoyable than the DVD.

I love the Bible. I do. And I think it is good to immerse kids in the Bible early on. While it is important for bible stories to be on the level of the child, I do think it is important to start sharing as soon as possible. More details, more stories can always be later on as the child begins to grow and develop.

What is good about the DVD is that the bible stories presented are short and simple and age-appropriate.

What isn't so good about the DVD is that the animation is at best mediocre. While the animation matches the quality of some Christian programming on TV, it doesn't really hold up all that well compared with the best Christian programming out there. And don't even think about comparing the quality of this animation with secular cartoons and movies.

It might be difficult when it comes to holding attention spans because the quality just isn't there. Of course, that would depend on your child--your preschooler/toddler. And it might hold the less active, easily entertained crowd.",1240790400,,1451,4.742063492063492
3447926,2,B001AGXE8S,"The Read and Share DVD Bible Volume 1 contains thirteen stories from the Old and New Testament. It covers big events like the creation of the world, the flood of the earth, and Jesus' birth. It also explores some lesser known stories ofIsaac and Rebekah and  Jacob and Esau.

It is formated in short segments. Each segment is about 3 minutes and contains narration, animation, and a musical background.

When I first received this product, I was expecting it to be something that could be put on the television to keep the attention of a 1-5 year old for about 30 minutes as it told some stories of the Bible. As I began to preview it, i found that it would not suit for that purpose.

Instead this product seems better suited for a teaching/church setting - in which a Bible story is going to be taught and talked about and the 3 minute clip will act as an enhancement to the lesson.

Not the best animation, not the best musical underscore and not the best narration voice. This product was sub-par for what I expected but yet can still be useful for aiding the teaching of little ones.",1240704000,3,1088,4.447236180904523
3447927,2,B001AGXE8S,"Kids today are more visual than ever. They read less and view more on TV and online--that's not news. Publishers see themselves as ""content producers"" rather than book publishers and look for ways to repurpose book content into other kinds of products--that's not news either.

What would be news would be a good children's Bible storybook leveraged into a great DVD. Sadly, I don't think that happened with Thomas Nelson's new Read and Share(tm) DVD Bible, Volume 1.

Like the original book--the Read and Share Bible by Gwen Ellis--the DVD aims at preschoolers. But the narration moves too slowly and sounds too flat to hold these youngest viewers. Even having male and female narrators doesn't really help, and the character voices--even though quite a few different voice actors are used--all sound a lot alike.

The colorful animation style fits preschoolers well. But some of the stories--like Laban tricking Jacob and giving him Leah instead of Rebekah, or Jesus being tempted in the wilderness by Satan (a guy in a hooded robe but without a head or face)--seem beyond the understanding of preschoolers.

I noticed a few biblical inaccuracies too--especially Jacob waving good-bye to Laban as he heads back home to Canaan and the prodigal son actually eating from the pig's trough instead of simply longing to.

The bonus features don't save the day. The instructions for accessing the coloring pages didn't work. The ""interviews with real kids"" consist of asking a roomful of antsy preschoolers about their favorite story--with ""Moses"" and ""Jesus"" the predictable answers. ""Behind the Scenes"" does provide an interesting look at how computerized animation works--but again, this is over the heads of the intended audience.",1240617600,,1729,5.205035971223022
3447928,5,B001AGXE8S,"I highly recommend this video resource for parents and churches. If you want flying Bibles, time machines, and superheroes set in Biblical times, this is not the video for you. But if you want Bible stories that stay true to the original Biblical text in excellent animation for your preschool and elementary children, you can't find a better resource.

The animation is top notch, you can use full screen and wide screen options, and it has DVD-Rom resources where you can print out coloring pictures. There's even a section with trailers, behind the scenes interviews, and other options.

But even more important, the children will learn Bible stories that stay true to the Biblical accounts. In volume one, stories one through eight are from the book of Genesis, and stories nine through thirteen, come from the life of Jesus. I give this my highest recommendation.",1240617600,,868,4.979310344827586
3447929,5,B001AGXE8S,"This is a wonderful DVD to watch as a family or for your young ones. The animation might be a bit simple but it's colorful and the characters are very cute.

I think the narration is done is a way to keep a child's attention. Their voices are calming and peaceful. The stories are a right length too, just long enough to educate a child while keeping their attention.

If you are looking for a great way to get some extra religious education into your child's life this is a wonderful DVD to use.",1240099200,,496,4.26595744680851

I found the stories to be animated nicely, straight to the point, simple and easy for a child to understand. There is a break between each story so you could choose a specific story to use with a Sunday school lesson etc. I fully intend on using this dvd with the kid's at church.",1240012800,5,448,4.044943820224719
3447931,4,B001AGXE8S,"The next thing I reviewed for Thomas Nelson was the ""Read and Share DVD Bible"".  This DVD has 13 stories from the Old and New Testament, including Adam and Eve, Jesus being tempted by Satan, Noah's Ark, and the story of Isaac and Rebekah.  It is labeled `Volume 1', so I'm assuming they will be making more of these.  Each story is approximately 3 minutes long, so the main part of the DVD is 40 minutes.  There is another 20 minutes of interviews with kids, behind the scenes clips, and other extras.  The DVD is a cartoon, and the animation is pretty basic, but fun to watch.  The narrator's voice is kind of monotone, and might not keep the attention of young children.  Overall, I like the DVD.  It is very accurate, and stays true to the Bible stories.  The 3 minute time frame for each story is long enough to tell the story, but short enough to keep the attention of children.  It gives a good overview, and will probably leave room for questions from your child.  I would recommend this DVD for children between the ages of 5 and 12.  I think other ages would enjoy it, but not as much as this age frame.",1239753600,,1112,4.318840579710145
3447932,4,B001AGXE8S,"The <span style=""color:#cc0000;"">""Read and Share DVD Bible"" (Volume 1)</span> contains 13 short stories ranging from ""Adam and Eve"" to ""Jesus is Tempted by Satan"". When I requested this DVD to review I was especially excited about one feature - the 3 minute stories. Each of the 13 animated stories is only three (3) minutes long. As the mom of a 20 month old, this was HUGE!

The first time we sat down together to view it, we made it through 7 stories with my daughter sitting quietly in my lap. I said quietly.....that's not really accurate. I have to say her favorite story was ""The Beginning"", six days of creation. She was anything but quiet. The animation was amazing and she proudly called out the names of things she knew.......fish, octopus, cloud, sky, lizard, cow, etc. Her other clear favorite stories were ""The Flood"" (more animals) and ""Jesus is Born"". The very next day, she asked to watch the rest. She said ""Jesus....tv"" (adorable).

She has even requested to watch it a third time. Clearly the stories with animals are her favorite. I am sure it's a toddler thing, but the people stories are a little less interesting to her. The advantage of owning the DVD is that we can use it as she grows in different ways to reemphasize what she is learning.

As a mom, this was probably the first time I really thought about what my daughter would watch.....and was it appropriate for her age. So far we haven't watched too much outside of Sprout (we love you Elmo). I didn't review it first without her, which is something I'll probably get in the habit of doing. For her age (still quite young) I didn't particularly like her watching Jacob and Esau physically fight. It wasn't bad but I am sure she was wondering what in the world was going on. I also thought that the faceless Satan was a little scary for her age. In reality I don't know how the animators could have done ""Satan"" differently. I mean, he is supposed to be evil, right? But, the faceless Satan reminded me of those guys on the horses in Lord of the Rings. Creepy & scary. Call me crazy, but I don't thing we'll watch that one again for a little while. She doesn't know scary yet.

That's the beauty of owning it though........we can watch those 2 particular stories when she is older. For now we'll continue to enjoy God creating the earth and Jesus loving the children.",1239580800,,2349,4.546099290780142

Each story is but three minutes long so as to not lose a child's attention. Told in a clear, simple manner with animated characters, these stories are entertaining and educational.

The use of bright colors, soft musical background and many animals throughout the presentation is sure to capture the hearts and minds of very young children.

At the end of the DVD is a short clip showing kids watching the DVD and then they tell what their favorite part is. I found this little clip interesting as most of the children gravitated towards Noah's ark or the stories of Jesus. A wonderful addition to any family's library.

1. The Beginning - Six Days of Creation

2. Adam and Eve - Sneaky Snake; Out of the Garden

3. The Flood - Noah's Big Boat; Animals Inside; The Dove; The Rainbow

6. Jacob and Esau - The Twins: Sneaky Jacon; Foolish Esau

7. Rachel - A Ladder to Heaven; Rachel; Tricked by Laban

8. Home Again - Jacob Wrestles with God; Jacob and Esau Meet

9. Jesus is Born - Mary's Big Surpirse; Joseph Marries Mary; Sleepy Shepherds: Gifts for Baby Jesus.

10. John the Baptist - Angel's Message; A Baby Named John; John Baptizes Jesus

11. Jesus Tempted by Satan - Stones to Bread Top of the Temple; Kindgoms of the World

12. Jesus Loves Children - Healing a Sick Boy; Bringing a Girl Back to Life; Loaves and Fishes

13. One Lost Sheep - A Son Spends His Money; Eating Pig's Food; Home to Father

The animation is simplistic, yet is well done enough to captivate a small child.

The narration is mixed for me. The male voice does not seem ""kid friendly"" to me though the female narrator's voice is.

Each story sticks to the Biblical story though some artistic license is used. For example, the animated characters of Noah and his wife are playing checkers on the ark. I do not find this a problem as the stories themselves are completely in line with the actual Bible story.

The only precaution I would offer, is that in the story of Jesus being tempted, Satan is portrayed as an animated figure in a dark brown cloak with just blackness for his face. Smaller children may be frightened by this.

The Read and Share Bible will be coming out with future DVD's containing more Bible stories and it is my hope that we can add every one of them to our personal library.",1239148800,,2134,4.3979591836734695

I thought we would just watch the first couple stories, but he was captivated for seven stories before he toddled away. The DVD incorporates lots of small animals which grabbed his attention and kept it. I know that at this point he doesn't follow the Bible stories being told, but he is hearing them and that is important.
After watching the DVD I think children ages 18 months to 5 or 6 years-old would most enjoy it. That being said, our older children, ages 7, 9, and 11 all watched the DVD the entire way through and really liked it. :)

3447937,2,B001AGXE8S,"From Thomas Nelson, the Read and Share DVD Volume 1 has 13 Bible stories beginning with the story of creation and concluding with the parable of the lost sheep.  The selection of stories is typical of any preschool Bible and is told with the same level of accuracy.  The details are simple but well presented for little minds to grasp the concept.

The animation is very simple and could possibly be considered archaic.  Computer animation has come so far that it is surprising to find this DVD to be so simple in its animation and graphics.  If your little one is used to Veggie Tales or Baby Einstein as my son is, then your child will likely find this DVD to be uninteresting.

Most of the stories are narrated and sound like the are being read straight from the Bible which is a good thing, but today's little ones are used to the story playing out before them, not being read to them from a television.

Considering this DVD is the same price as most Baby Einstein videos I would expect the DVD to much better quality.  I am happy to play the DVD and have the Bible stories in the background, but my son will certainly not be sitting in front of the television absorbing the words as he does with Baby Eienstein.",1238889600,,1217,4.401785714285714

My nephew enjoyed the animals, especially the two bunnies that were seen throughout the DVD. His favorite story was Noah and the ark. My son's favorite story was Adam and Eve. He did say that he did not like that the characters did not talk a lot. The narrarator did most of the talking. He also wanted to see Shadrach, Meshach, and Abendego.

The thirteen stories are well done. They give all the details in the story in a quick three minute video so it keeps the attention of little ones. I do wish there would have been more of an emphasis on Jesus throughout each story as I have seen with other publications.

The DVD also included fun bonus material including coloring pages, chidren's interviews, and behind the scenes video.

Overall, I think the DVD is well done. I would recommend the video for families with young children, Sunday School teachers, or day care workers. It is an added bonus to our video library. My son has already watched it numerous times.",1238803200,,1107,4.47029702970297

DVD
By Gwen Ellis

Share the joy and wonder of God's Word with the children in your life.

Thirteen essential lessons of scripture starring the Bible's best-known characters. The Read And Share(tm) Bible on DVD combines an enchanting art style with a warm narrator and gentle musical underscore to transport kids back to Biblical times. The bite-size vignettes are perfect for the attention span of little ones, and give parents maximum flexibility to fit any time-frame.

Stories include: The Beginning, Adam & Eve, The Flood, Abram, Isaac & Rebekah, Jacob & Esau, Rachel, Jacob & God, John the Baptist, Jesus is Born, Jesus is Tempted, Jesus Love Children, and One Lost Sheep.

I think this dvd is meant for toddlers.  The animation is engaging and the stories themselves are good.  I could see a toddler or younger pre schooler watching the stories.  I had a big issue with one thing though, the narration.  This is clearly marketed for kids and the narration is flat and downright boring.  It's a shame because it really takes away all the positive things in this dvd.

My guess is the animation is good enough that perhaps with a young viewer, this dvd will hold interest.  An older child of four or older, I'm not so sure.  I was expecting exciting narration to back up great stories our family could enjoy over and over.

My children rarely sit down to watch a full video but with this one they were very interested in sitting there quietly through the whole DVD.

I found it to be very informational for children and an easier way for them to understand  what is in the Bible. The stories were geared towards small children and make an excellent supplement to reading the Bible to them. My children never get tired of watching the stories over and over again. They also like to remind others about Jesus and they will qote straight from the movie.

3447942,4,B001AGXE8S,"Read and Share Volume 1 is a collection of 13 animated Bible stories. I watched these DVDs with my two kids. They are 5 and 6.5. Here are some of our thoughts.

The Good
First of all, the kids found these videos to be enjoyable. They sometimes even asked to watch more than I had planned for our daily Bible time.

I found the animation to be pleasant. It looked hand-drawn, but the shadows and such were so well done that I think it must have been computer generated.

Topics such as Satan and polygamist marriages were handled tastefully without re-writing history. Angels were made to look powerful instead of cutesy. I found this refreshing for a children's product.

The Annoying
Noah's ark was represented as a tiny vessel that could barely fit two elephants let alone 2 or 7 of every kind of animal in the world. Also Noah's family was represented as a bunch of white (or possibly Hispanic) looking people. This undermines the fact that all people on earth today came from this one family.

Not very much of the Old Testament was covered. For example there is no mention of Joseph, Moses, Joshua, the judges, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Hezekiah, Josiah, Daniel or Nehemiah. After Jacob and Esau you skip to Baby Jesus. Granted this is Volume 1, but if these stories are going to be included in Volume 2 then the chronological nature of the videos will be skewed.

There are a couple of minor inaccuracies. For example, one of the disciples that Jesus takes with him to Jairus' house is a woman. I want accuracy even in the small things especially when my children are watching.

The title of this DVD is misleading. There is nothing to read. After getting the DVD, I learned that the title is after a Bible story book. But I didn't know that when I got it and so was expecting some kind of reading to be intertwined.

Because of these annoyances I can't give this very well animated and scripted video 5 stars. I have to go with 3.5 (maybe 4).",1238112000,,1955,4.518413597733711
3447943,3,B001AGXE8S,"The Read and Share DVD Bible includes 13 bite-size stories from the Old and New Testament including Creation, Adam and Eve, The Flood, Jacob and Esau, John the Baptist and more.

My three year old son loves for me to read from the Read and Share Bible story book so I was confident he'd enjoy the DVD as a source of learning and entertainment during times when I needed him to play independently.

However, the simplicity of the animation and less than enthusiastic narration did not hold his attention. Perhaps he's already moved beyond the level of this DVD. Yet he still absolutely loves the Praise Baby series and those DVDs are meant for the younger set.  He aloso enjoys Veggie Tales and Boz the Bear, so I think DVDs that incorporate music are more his forte.

I do like the auto-start feature. I wish more dvds would start right when you put them in as opposed to flipping through any number of previews and features. Perhaps I'll give this DVD a try when my infant son is a little bit older. For now, I'll stick to reading the Read and Share Bible with my preschooler.",1238025600,,1077,4.479591836734694
3447944,5,B001AGXE8S,"The DVD is broken down into 13 stories (approx. 3 minutes each in length) and has a run time of 1 hour.  The stories range from the creation to stories about Jesus to John the Baptist to Jacob and Essau.  All of the animation is somewhat simple compared to a lot of animation these days.  But the images on screen are bright and colorful and the narrations are simple and easy to follow and understand.  There are several different narrators to the stories adding some variation from story to story.  The music in each of the stories is calming and fits each of the stories.  All of these qualities aid in the DVD's ability to capture little ones attentions.

My daughter is only 18-months-old and so I wasn't expecting much in regards to her attention when I put the DVD on.  I was surprised to find she wanted to sit on my lap and watch.  She sat through two stories before she wanted down and to go and play.  I was very impressed that it was able to keep her captivated for that long.

Even though each story is short, it captures the main ideas and facts from the Bible.  I don't think it would be wise to use the DVD alone to teach a child about the Bible, hence the title of the DVD being both ""Read"" and ""Share.""  I plan to use this in addition to the Bible stories that we read to my daughter and of course church and Sunday school. Hopefully this will help to give her a more well-rounded knowledge and understanding to the Bible.",1238025600,,1440,4.288888888888889
3447945,4,B001AGXE8S,"I loved watching another winning children's Dvd from Thomas Nelson! This time I viewed an animated and well narrated Dvd filled with thirteen short Bible stories by Gwen Ellis. This successful Dvd moves along quite nicely, holding your attention while stories of biblical truth are told. The voice of the narrators are great and the angels are so cool! One hour of viewing is perfect for children up to age 6-8. Although perhaps you might want to pause the Dvd half way through and have a delightful intermission.

The Dvd starts with The Beginning. The animation of creation is quite lovely filled with waterfalls and vines, starfish and humming birds, and puppies and lizards! I was deeply touched as a parent and a Grandma to see how the Dvd ended with two wonderful chapters on God's love for the children.",1237939200,,810,4.785714285714286
3447946,3,B001AGXE8S,"My son has autism and is a very visual learner so I thought this would help him comprehend some of the Bible stories a little better.  We sat down as a family to view it and I hoped we would be able to make it through one or two of the stories at a time.

The first thing I noticed about the DVD is that the animation is very basic.  We get so used to Disney and Pixar that it is sometimes easy for us to forget that not all animation can be that kind of quality.  The kids didn't seem to mind one bit.

My son is six and made it through one story before it lost his attention.  I think he was expecting some music.  My 4 year old daughter, however, was totally enthralled.  She loved it and watched all 60 minutes at once.  She loved the stories of Jacob and Esau and the birth of Jesus especially.  There are 13 stories in all and they each last about 3 minutes.  They stick to the Bible and are very general in their terms so these stories appeal to a wide range of denominations.

If you're looking for something for the kids to watch and be able to discuss for family night, this might be a good choice for you.  I can tell that it appeals more to the younger kids so if you've got some toddlers or preschoolers, they might enjoy it.",1237852800,,1238,4.024590163934426
3447947,5,B001AGXE8S,"I recently received The Read & Share DVD Bible Volume 1 and was really excited about it. I had seen it and the Bible that goes along with it when I worked a table at the last Women of Faith Conference I attended in Denver.  So, I pulled it out and told my 2 yr old daughter that I had a video I wanted her to watch with me.  We snuggled up together to watch.

The video is well put together.  The animation is not the quality of Disney movies, but it is nice without going overboard.  It is mostly narrated and only some of the time do the individual characters actually speak.  This did not affect my 2 yr old at all, she was held in rapt attention for the duration of its playing time.  When we got to about the 3rd or 4th story, my 7 yr old son heard what we were watching and joined us.  The first thing he said is, ""Why don't they talk?""  Although, he noticed and mentioned this... it didn't seem to affect his interest in the video.  I had to stop watching it to cook supper and he wanted to put it on downstairs and start at the beginning of the video.

All in all, I think The Read & Share DVD Bible Vol 1 is a wonderful tool to use with children. The stories are short enough to keep the attention of a 2 yr old and interesting enough to keep the attention of a 7 yr old.",1237680000,,1280,3.9416342412451364
3447948,5,B001AGXE8S,"my kids- ages 3,5,7 and 8 all liked this film very much. the short stories were perfect for their short attention spans and the music was a plus, setting the tone for scenes. i also liked being able to stop the dvd easily in between stories and being able to discuss what we had just seen.

the extras, like the coloring sheets, helped to reenforce the stories as well. what mom doesn't like extras?!

all in all i'd say this was a great dvd.",1237680000,,442,4.25
3447949,4,B001AGXE8S,"The Read and Share DVD Bible was a very well done animated film. The thing that I appreciated the most about it was its' thorough yet concise way of telling each of the thirteen stories from the Old and New Testament. Each story was long enough to include all of the key parts of the Biblical account of each story, but they were short enough to not lose the interest of our little ones' attention span.

The animation is well done, although my children were quick to add that they did not care for the round noses on the characters! One of my children was also disappointed that they skipped a few stories in the Old Testament.

The only thing that I wish was added to this film, would be that it would tie the message of Christ and redemption throughout the Old Testament stories (like Sally Lloyd-Jones does in her book The Jesus Storybook Bible. I wish that the Gospel message was woven throughout all of the stories, as it is in the Bible.

Overall, I think that this is a great addition to our family's DVD collection, and I would recommend it to others. It would probably also be a great aid to Sunday School teachers or Junior Church workers",1237507200,,1149,4.410377358490566
3447950,4,B001AGXE8S,This move is great for anyone trying to share scripture stories with their toddler.  There are thirteen stories on the disc.  They start with the story of creation in the Old Testament and end with the story of the lost sheep from the New Testament.  We use the King James version of the bible in our home so I found the stories to be very simplified.  The language was much more casual than I was used to but my two year old loved it.  I think it is a great tool to get the basic principles of the story across to young children.  Each story is kept at 3 or 4 minutes so they would be great to use for lessons at home.  My two year old sat and watched the entire disc though and wanted to see it again when it was over.  She calls it the Jesus Movie.  I thought they choose a good variety of stories dealing with different topics from both the Old and New Testament.  This is Volume 1 and we will definitely be looking forward to seeing which stories are included in the next volume.  I would recommend it for children up to age 6 or 7.,1237507200,,1037,4.059113300492611
3447951,4,B001AGXE8S,"I recently discovered the opportunity to review products for Thomas Nelson Publishers.  The first product I chose to review was the Read and Share Bible DVD - Volume 1.  This DVD series is based on the Read and Share Bible by Gwen Ellis (also published by Thomas Nelson).  The DVD included thirteen short vignettes of both Old and New Testament stories - from Creation to the Parables of Jesus.  Each vignette is about three minutes long and uses a unique art-style, narration, and background music to grab the attention of young children.  The DVD also included a few ""extras"" including ""interviews"", ""behind the scenes"", and coloring pages.

Personally, I would not attempt to show this DVD to anyone above the age of 4 or 5 (and that may be pushing it).  My daughter (age 2), who loves cartoons, didn't really care for the style of the presentation (not a whole lot of character interaction - mostly narrative).  It was definitely ""Sunday School"" material.  If you were only watching one of the vignettes to reemphasize the lesson for the day, it's a GREAT resource.  However, I would not recommend sitting and watching the DVD in it's entirety, as it starts to get slightly repetitive and since the cartoons all look alike, children may have problems determining what story they are watching.

The ""extras"" seemed a little pointless to me.  The ""interviews"" was the camera man asking a class of kids what their favorite story was on the DVD - most gave the ""Sunday School"" answer of ""JESUS!""  Surprised?  I thought it was an unnecessary addition to the DVD.  The ""behind the scenes"" part was neat, if you wanted to learn about how they do the cartooning aspect of the DVDs, but I'm not sure who the intended audience was, since I'm sure it wasn't for the same kids that were watching the stories on the DVD.  The coloring pages (ten in total) were nice, but they didn't exactly coordinate with the stories - i.e. there was a picture of Moses and the 10 Commandments, but that wasn't one of the stories on the DVD, and most of the other pictures were just random animals.

All that to say, this is a great RESOURCE for Sunday school teachers who want a way to help the kids remember the lesson for the day, but I don't think this DVD is a very good ""at home"" DVD to sit and watch in it's entirety.  Just keep in mind the age group this is aimed at (1-4 year olds) and the setting it's best viewed in (class-type setting, watching only one or two vignettes at a time), and you will be able to thoroughly enjoy this DVD resource!",1237334400,,2530,4.547461368653422
3447952,3,B001AGXE8S,"We just received the Read and Share DVD Bible Volume 1 from Thomas Nelson to review.  It's a 60-minute dvd, broken down into 13 different stories ranging from The Beginning, Adam and Eve, and the Flood up to Jesus is Born, Jesus Tempted by Satan and One Lost Sheep.  Each story is just 3 minutes, and though my 6 yo eagerly watched the whole dvd in one sitting, it would be easy enough to show younger kids just one or two stories at a time - the dvd menu is helpful there.  The animation is bright and cheerful, if simple and quickly rendered, with dialogue and some sound effects and quiet music.  The stories are narrated by different storytellers and the language is easy for my kids to understand, with motives and meanings made clear.

Here's my son's review:

""I just like to watch it, because it has good stories and I like the Bible.  And the people have cool names, like remember the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar?""

We do enjoy listening to the Jim Weiss cd ""Tales from the Old Testament"" and have enjoyed learning about biblical stories as part of our ancient history studies centered on Story of the World Volume 1.  My son is drawn to all kinds of mythology and creation stories from many cultures, and Christian mythology is no different.  They all have funny names and interesting tales of good vs. evil and hard decisions! Besides the immediate enjoyment, this dvd is a fine way for the kids to get a basic cultural understanding of a few of the stories from the Bible that they will see referenced in other movies, literature and general conversations as they grow into the world.",1237334400,,1600,4.562937062937063

3447955,4,B001AGXE8S,"This is about a 60 minute DVD with 13 segments, highlighting 13 best loved stories from the Bible.  Each segment is about 3 minutes long.  The segments include 1) ""The Beginning"" which explains the creation.  2) ""Adam and Eve"" which shows Eve being tempted by a snake and Adam and Eve being cast out of the Garden.  3) ""The Flood"" which shows Noah building the Ark, collecting the animals, the flood and then land and the rainbow. 4) ""Abram"" which shows Abram and Sarah being brought to the promised land through the birth of baby Isaac.  5) ""Isaac and Rebekah"" which shows the servant being sent for a wife for Issac and bringing Rebekah back with him.  6) ""Jacob and Esau"" shows the twins being born and the selling of the birthright.  7) ""Rachel"" shows Jacob working for Rachel, being tricked to marry Leah and then working longer to marry Rachel as well.  8) ""Home Again"" which shows Jacob bringing his family back home with him and reuniting with his brother Esau.  9) ""John the Baptist"" shows the circumstances surrounding John's miraculous birth and him baptizing Jesus.  10) ""Jesus is Born"" shows the angel coming to Mary through the birth of Jesus.  11) ""Jesus Tempted by Satan"" shows the temptations Jesus faced from Satan.  12) ""Jesus Loves Children"" shows Jesus healing children and performing the miracle of the loaves and fishes.  And 13) ""One Lost Sheep"" shows the story of the Prodigal Son.

I chose this DVD because I thought it might be a good Sunday video for my kids to watch.  We sat down one evening after we received it and we all watched it together.  I thought it was a good little video without any major doctrinal issues.  I am reviewing this from an LDS perspective and that was very important to me.  There were a couple things that were a little off in my opinion, like angels having wings and Jacob actually ""wrestling"" with God before he went out to meet Esau, his estranged brother.  But other then those few things I think that it was well done to help young children understand the basics of these gospel stories.  My 6 year old and 3 year old boys sat and watched the whole thing very calmly without jumping around or being wild which is a feet in itself so that alone tells me that it was well done to teach children and to keep their attention.",1236816000,,2282,4.533007334963325

My four-year-old and my seven-year-old were both fascinated by this DVD and enjoyed watching it over and over.  My teenagers weren't as impressed (and pointed out where they misquoted Scripture) but the DVD isn't designed for teenagers, and the language is simplified to be more appropriate for younger minds.

I think the READ AND SHARE DVD BIBLE would be a great addition to every church library, and even personal library. It includes some bonus material, such as interviews with ""real kids"", behind the scenes footage, coloring pages, and other assets. 60 minutes.

3447958,5,B001AGXE8S,"I love anything that anything that drives home Biblical truths, and when it's done with little one's short attention span and understanding in mind, it's even better.

I was very impressed from the time I put in the DVD until the time that it ended. The short Bible stories begin with Adam and Eve and go through 12 more stories culminating in The Lost Sheep (the wayward son parable). The cartoon style movie was very colorful and allowed for easy focusing for the child, even a child whose focus isn't maintained for long will enjoy it. The narrator spoke slowly and carefully for the child to understand the story and along with titles before each 3 minute story, it was easily understood what the story was about.

The total running time for the DVD is 60 minutes - not including the special features. With each story a length of 3 minutes, a family can watch one and then read the corresponding story from the Bible for even more Biblical applications, or allow the child to watch the whole DVD at a time. If you choose to let your child watch the whole DVD at a time, there are no worries about inappropriate language, behavior or costuming - so it is okay to use it while you get the laundry done or was the dishes.

Like every DVD there are bonus materials: dolby surround sound, widescreen/fullscreen, interviews with ""real kids"", ""behind the scenes"", trailers, coloring pages and auto-start. We didn't view much of the bonus materials but from what I did view, it was much like other materials on other DVD's. I must say the best bonus material is by far the coloring pages and auto start. Pop the DVD into your computer and follow the easy directions to get a 10 page coloring book. The images are big and will allow the youngest to the oldest child to enjoy coloring the images. The auto-start allows you (or your child) to put in the DVD into the player and off it goes - no need to press play or other buttons - it's made this way so that children can watch it by themselves.

My children insisted on watching it immediately after me removing it from the package and we were not dissapointed. They were all enthralled, my oldest at 7 years, my middle child at 4 1/2 and my youngest at 2 1/2 years old. Overall, this is a truly well made and Biblically correct DVD that children can enjoy and parents don't have to worry over letting their children watch it.

The stories were well done and good overviews of the Biblical stories they portrayed.  All of the information was accurate, however some information was lacking in a few of the stories.  The quick 3 minute stories are perfect as an addition to a Sunday school lesson, or as a starting point for stories at home. Each of the 13 stories are self-contained but can be watched with the surrounding stories as well.  My favorite segment was titled ""Jesus Loves the Children"" in which he shows his love for them through acts of healing, compassion and even using them through the feeding of the 5000 with the bread and fish.  My only concern was during the story of Adam and Eve, the snake convinced Eve to eat the apple, but it was not referenced as Satan being the snake.  Also, God was just ""sad"" that they ate the apple and made them leave, there was no mention of them ""sinning"" causing them to leave the garden.

8277365,4,B001AGXE8S,"The Read and Share DVD Bible is a collection of 13 Bible stories, told through animation and quite a bit of narration. The stories are drawn from both the Old and New Testaments and each story is approximately three minutes long. The Bible accounts are presented clearly and gently, easy for kids to understand and follow along.

To be honest, when my son was 2 and 3, he had very little interest in this DVD at first.  The animation is cute and colorful, but is not as ""advanced"" as that in many other children's DVDs. And though the stories are acted out, the action is very calm and simple. In addition, though my son loves when I read to him, he wasn't used to DVDs that rely so much on narration. Personally, I didn't find anything wrong with animation or presentation, but it just didn't hold his attention as much as some other DVDs, such as the Veggie Tales line.

However, as he has gotten older, he's been enjoying the DVD more and more. Just the other day, we were watching it together and he was asking me for more specifics about some of the Bible stories. At age 4.5, he pays attention for the entire DVD and enjoys all the segments.

My husband and I currently teach the four-year-olds at our church and I could see this DVD being very useful in a Sunday School setting. The short segments would be perfect for illustrating individual Bible stories and would be just the right length for a group of preschoolers. I think younger kids would struggle to feel engaged by this DVD, but kids age 4-6 would be perfect. At home, the Read and Share DVD Bible would make a nice supplement to family Bible reading.

The 3 yr old is especially captivated.  It is heavy on narration. I was surprised to discover that this doesn't bother them in the least.  The narration is done perfectly for small children, with concise sentences spoken very clearly and a little slowly. It's still interesting to listen to for my husband and I.  Both of our children love to dance and sing, however the lack of catchy songs does not bother them in the least.  The animation is also simple, although well done.  We actually purposely avoid dvds that are heavy on cutting-edge technical animation as we want our kids to be happy watching older videos that have much better and more complex dialogue.

We also like that this series manages to be Biblically accurate while sanitizing stories appropriately for little ones.  For example, in the story of Noah, the emphasis is on Noah praying and being obedient to God; it shows building the ark, the animals, a flood without gory details, the rainbow showing God's promise to not flood the earth again.  In another children's Bible video that I purchased recently, the emphasis was on how evil the people were before the flood, with multiple examples of people acting in awful ways, then it had waves of water washing people away.

The only negative about these dvds for us is that previews of other Thomas Nelson videos always play at the beginning and have to be forwarded through.",1277510400,,1551,4.707407407407407

In fact I told our children that it was time to eat, and no one moved... We had to pause the movie. I see why this movies is out of stock right now. (We also own the Easter read and share movie by this same company).

You can stop the movie in between breaks and discuss each scene. I also enjoyed the movie as an adult, the stories are fun and full of color. I like how it informs the children of stores from the bible. It is great to have movies like this for children to view, instead of other things that may not feed their spirits.

The most important fact to me, is that children learn true bible stories that will stick with them for a life time. They gain knowledge of the bible and things that took place in the bible. This is great clean family entertainment!

To many this movie may be simple in graphics, however in these current times, you find that less is more and the simple things of life become the beauty of life.

I highly recommend this movie, along with Veggie tales, Jr's Giants, Angel wars, Hermie and friends, and Praise baby. All are great.

Last point: the movie is out of stock, and that should speak for it's self. If you are wondering if you will purchase this movies, hopefully that will help you decide.

Enjoy.",1267920000,,1369,4.246153846153846
