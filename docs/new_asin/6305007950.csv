Though not perfect, it fixes a few problems of its prequel and benefits greatly from the participation of action maestro Stanley Tong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Chan-s-First-Strike/dp/0780622677/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie Chan's First Strike</a>). The biggest disappointment is that it de-emphasizes the roles of its female stars to a degree, to the point that this is almost a strict solo vehicle for lead Alex Fong, but in the end, this doesn't hurt the film so much as to make it unenjoyable.

The story: the returning Iron Angels (including the aforementioned Fong, as well as Moon Lee and Elaine Liu) see their peaceful Malaysian vacation turn into an emergency mission when it's revealed that their host (Nathan Chan) is planning an overthrow of the government through the employ of his fascist guerilla army.

There are three ways that ""Angels 2"" differs from its predecessor, and the most notable of these is its focus on Alex Fong. Moon Lee and Elaine Liu are clearly side-characters, for the meat of the plot is that Alex Fong's and Nathan Chan's characters are college buddies, and the ultimate pitting of the two against eachother is played for tragic (if slightly overblown) effect. Additionally, while the first film was a very straight-forward action flick, this one is a bit more typically Hong Kong-ish for featuring notable segments of comedy (e.g. the goofy cab driver) and romance (e.g. Elaine has the hots for Peter). Luckily, these are kept to moderation, so for once these additions serve to embellish the film rather than detract from it, making it more of a well-rounded movie. Lastly, this sequel does a much better job of distributing its action content, so that you needn't wait until the second half of the picture to begin paying attention like the last one.

Anyone who knows their Hong Kong filmmakers will be excited at the mention of Stanley Tong's name, but while I give the movie's action content a general thumbs-up, it helps to *not* expect Jackie Chan-style fights and stuntwork in this one. The first shootout occurs within the first four minutes and about two or three more follow, but while occasionally furious, they're not fantastic. How much you enjoy the six fistfights depends on both your expectations and your level of experience with Hong Kong action. Alex Fong hogs two-thirds of the brawls, and while more than serviceable, they're not great. The standout fight is the semi-finale between Moon Lee and head henchman Jackson Ng (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magic-Crystal/dp/B007GOQYYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magic Crystal</a>), which is fast-paced and well-choreographed enough to amaze you to know that Lee isn't a classically-trained martial artist. The woman could've definitely been the next Michelle Yeoh, had she been cast more prominently.

There's an instance of rather disgusting animal abuse in the film that I can't overlook which definitely keeps the film from a higher rating. Still, the following scene wherein Moon & co. launch an attack on guerrilla baddies with a crossbow and a blowgun is a guilty pleasure. All in all, the movie is worth watching for casual Hong Kong fans, and definitely so for fans of Alex Fong and Moon Lee. If it sounds like your kind of thing, don't hesitate hunting down your preferred release of this.",1357603200,,3698,5.539823008849558
