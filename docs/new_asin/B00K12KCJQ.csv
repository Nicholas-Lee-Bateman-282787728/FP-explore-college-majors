6398243,4,B00K12KCJQ,"In a fascinating coincidence this excellent film,and Hany Abu-Assad's even better 'Omar' appeared at nearly the same time. Both tell similar stories, one from the Israeli perspective and one from the Palestinian. Both tell of a young man recruited (or forced) into being an informer for the Israelis. We see these young men torn in multiple directions, risking their lives if they are uncovered, trying to play one side against the other, finding themselves drawn ever deeper in a morass they are powerless to stop.

In Bethlehem the 'hero' is only a teenager, and an immature one at that. His older brother is an accomplished terrorist/freedom fighter, leaving his little brother Sanfur without much of an identity of his own, he seems overlooked by his family and unimportant to his community. Ironically in many ways Sanfur's closest relationship is to his middle-aged Israeli 'handler', who also clearly has fatherly feelings towards the youth, further complicating the relationship.

The acting is generally excellent, and there's a lot of thriller like tension to go along with the human drama. I actually saw this and 'Omar' within days of each other, and I would recommend the same approach to others. Seeing the two sides of the same coin gives a feeling of greater insight into the conundrum that is the middle-east. Also, both directors are careful not to paint black and white portraits of either side, both treat all involved as human, so the differences in perspective are both fascinating and subtle.",1409184000,6,1515,5.080321285140562
6398244,3,B00K12KCJQ,"It was an interesting story but had no clear development of the two characters and no logical resolution. As far as I know, once a Palestinian is accused of being an informer, the accused is immediately put to death and never given another chance.",1408320000,,247,4.636363636363637
6398245,4,B00K12KCJQ,"Great movie even if the topic is sad. The bit of background music and its timing added to the suspense. A lot of info on the groups was incorporated in the plot, but done well. I think it was trying to show the differences within both sides as well as each other. This is the first movie I have seen where the Palestinians are not shown as one unified group of people. I've recommended it to friends.",1406678400,2,400,4.207792207792208

6398247,4,B00K12KCJQ,"As a filmic experience, very disturbing and worthwhile seeing.

6398251,4,B00K12KCJQ,"An excellent film even if not a masterpiece .  So 4/5 . I can't remember anything close coming out of the big name film making centres in a long while. The sad reality of the region probably makes it easier to create a plot ... but the tightness with which the plot is presented is something I have been missing in films . The dialogue is good .... falls short only if you consider that a fuller characterisation would have been desirable . The dialogue mostly deal with the plot twists and the emotions which are carried through pretty well . The performances , across the board are extraordinary . If one is used to the dumb staccato style of acting ( typical Hollywood with very few exceptions ) one may find this rather natural and sensitive rendition to be useless .... mind you this is  NOT underplayed but exactly what it should be . No star power ... everyone looks and behaves the character. Someone is scared ... looks scared without going into facial gymnastics .  A fleeting moment of emotion passes over .... it passes over and does not require glycerine and howling. The film has been pulled at a low cost and maybe that shows a bit but only a bit and given the subject I see no reason why it would detract. The  film may have had a little more imaginative lighting though . The cinematography is not supporting the film to the extent that it could have ... how I would not know bit the cinematography does stand out as weak given in almost everything else , the film is strong. By the way I did not mean there is lack of gloss and warm colours etc. That is not the subject .... but sunlight too can be shot in a more supportive way .",1402876800,13,1648,4.306451612903226

6398253,5,B00K12KCJQ,"This movie portrayed life in Palestine as chaotic as it is. It brought realism to a situation that Palestinians encounter on a daily basis. Who do they side with, and if they side with either Israel or Palestine - they become a target. This is a no win situation. Keep hoping for change and a truce between these two people.  May peace be upon them.",1447113600,,349,4.369230769230769

6398257,5,B00K12KCJQ,"The first scene involves some Palestinian boys engaged in an updated version of ""chicken"" in the desert outside of Jerusalem. Instead of some teenagers in the 1950's driving their cars off some embankment as in ""Rebel without a Cause"", these boys are using semi-automatic weapons and a rather worn ""bullet-proof"" vest. The main character of the film, Sanfur (played by Shadi Mar'i in completely convincing performance), is a Palestinian teenager who dons the vest and instructs his fellow peers to shoot him, if they have the guts. This is a game but a very brutal one. When some of the adults appear on the scene, the kids scatter. But I think the point is the adults are playing at the same brutal game, daring each other to fire at one another.

The film involves three groups: two militia groups of Palestinians who are somewhat at odds with each other, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and their common enemy, the Israels. Sanfur is literally caught between all three who seem to be playing a very deadly game of tug-of-war. His family is sympathetic to the Palestinian Authority but he socializes with people in Hamas, the more radical of the two. At the same time, Sanfur is good friends with Razi (Tsahi Halevi in an equally compelling performance), who is in reality an Israeli agent. His agency's duty is to infiltrate the Palestinian regions near Jerusalem and Bethlehem and root out members of the Palestinian militia groups. While Ravi appears to be Sanfur's friend at one level, the Israeli is using the boy to obtain information about Hamas.

The conflict begins with a decision to hunt down and assassinate a Hamas leader name of Ibrahim, whom the Israelis have been chasing for a year but is also, unfortunately, Sanfur's brother. Sanfur finds himself caught between the radical Hamas leaders, his family which appear to be on the moderate side of the conflict, and Ravi the Israeli, who has become like a father-figure for the boy. Now the boy is torn between all these loyalties. The crucial moment of the film occurs when Sanfur forces Ravi to take a kind of test of friendship. Will he succeed or fail? Will the boy side with the Palestinian authority, Hamas or with the Israeli agent?

An incredibly compelling film, but a very dark one about the current hostilities between Israelis and Palestinians. The acting is outstanding, and I have read that some of the actors had never performed in a film before. The viewer feels as if he or she is with these people, almost spying on their conversations and actions. There is never a dull moment, but this is not that kind of film where the good guys and the bad guys are neatly spelled out for us.",1434672000,,2669,4.747844827586207

8655062,4,B00K12KCJQ,"Bethlehem Westend Films NR 2013 DVD

This is an Israeli film.  The dialog is in Hebrew and Arabic but there are good English subtitles.  It is about the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and about how the Shin Bet manages assets to provide them intelligence on Palestinian terrorists or resistance fighters [depending which side is describing them].  The story is fictional but I think illustrative of real events.  The title relates to part of the setting for the film because the story involves a family from Bethlehem in which the older son is a major figure in Al Aqsa Brigades who also begins working with Hamas.  The younger son becomes an informant for Israelis.  This is a story that cannot possibly end well for all concerned.  No comedy, but well done.",1467763200,2,758,4.8671875

8655067,5,B00K12KCJQ,"Set in Bethlehem during the current Arab-Israeli conflict, Yuval Adler's film (cowritten with Ali Wakad) concentrates on the life of seventeen-year-old Sanfur (Shadi Mar'i) an Israeli Arab trying to survive in the midst of almost impossible conflict. Cultivated at an early age by Israeli Secret Service officer Razi (Tsahi Halevi) to be a spy for the Israeli cause, he reports on the activities of the Palestine Liberation Front and Hamas. At the same time he fulfills the same role for the PLF, led by thuggish man Badawi (Hitham Omari) who has known Sanfur since childhood. Sanfur twists and turns, telling the stories that both Razi and Badawi want to hear until the complications of his life become too difficult to manage, with tragic consequences.

BETHLEHEM looks at the ways in which Sanfur's life is dependent on family values as he is morally obliged to avenge the death of his older brother brahim (Tarik Kopty), while at the same time trying to conceal his association with Razi from his father Nasser (George Iskandar). Familial traditions are so strong that the younger siblings have little or no power of self-determination. Hence we feel for Sanfur as his face becomes more and more contorted with pain as he tries to maintain an urbane faade while fulfilling impossible tasks.

As far as the civil war is concerned, the film suggests that involvement is very much a badge of male power. By carrying guns and patrolling the streets in search of enemies, the young man (Palestinian and Israeli alike) feel that they are somehow committed to a cause, giving them the excuse to indulge in pointless violence. Sanfur becomes embroiled in that culture, even though he is manifestly unsuited for the task.

Set in a series of dingy rooms and dark passages in a ruined city, the film creates an underworld in which concepts of ""good"" and ""evil,"" or ""right"" and ""wrong,"" simply do not exist. No one, it seems, can grow up unaffected (or should it be corrupted) by the civil war, which seems never-ending, despite continued calls for a ceasefire.",1452384000,,2054,4.913544668587896
8655068,5,B00K12KCJQ,"No matter how rancorous, desperate, or dirty American politics get, they always retain a measure of hope, an optimism that the future will be different, better.

That light seems missing for the players in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Theirs is a politics of tragedy - a point driven home with devastating power and extraordinary artistic rigor in Bethlehem, the debut feature from writer-director Yuval Adler, a former Israeli intelligence officer who came to filmmaking armed with a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University.

A rich, multi layered character study cleverly garbed as an action thriller, Bethlehem is a searing critique of the conflict and its toll - not just in human lives, but also in two peoples' gradual, overall loss of humanity. It was co-written by Ali Waked, a prominent Palestinian Muslim journalist often rebuked for his expos&eacute;s of corruption within the Palestinian leadership.

Tsahi Halevi stars as Razi, an officer in the Israeli Secret Service tasked with cultivating Palestinian assets - men and women who can provide information about anti-Israeli activities. A thoughtful, shy family man, Razi has struck gold in Sanfur (Shadi Mar'i), a 17-year-old from Bethlehem whom he has gradually befriended over several years.

Sanfur (his name is slang for Smurf) turns out to be a prime asset: His brother Ibrahim (Hisham Suliman) is a rising star in the leadership of the militant Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and already has organized suicide bomb attacks.

The film deconstructs the strange ethics at work in the cop-informant/spy-asset relationship.

It's clear Razi cares for his teenage informant. But so do all intelligence officers for their key assets. Part of their job is to seduce, befriend, to be the target's father, mother, lover, child, and it requires the kind of maneuvering and manipulation therapists often use.

Could Razi love the boy as one of his own? Does Sanfur exist for him beyond his usefulness?

For his part, Sanfur, virtually ignored by his superstar brother, relies on Razi as friend and confessor. But he's also consumed by rage against the Israeli army and guilt for betraying his brother.

Things come to a head when a Palestinian suicide bomber kills nine and injures 23 in downtown Jerusalem.

A series of tragedies befall the characters when Razi is pressured by his superiors to force Sanfur to disclose Ibrahim's hiding place. To Razi's commanding officer, Sanfur's life means next to nothing, his death an acceptable price for stopping Ibrahim - just as Ibrahim has little concern for the lives of suicide bombers, so-called martyrs to the cause.

Astonishing, compelling, and uncompromising, Bethlehem will make many a viewer's blood boil. Yet it doesn't exactly take sides: It's equally lacerating to both sides in the conflict. The filmmakers seem more interested in making a larger point about the destructive power of certain political beliefs and social situations to take away free will and enmesh otherwise ordinary people in a tragic cycle of violence.

It's a satisfying film that works equally well as an intense thriller, a stunning portrait of two characters who seem driven not by desire or rational choice but by fate, and a biting commentary on a region defined by a tragic sense of history and pulled into the future by the overwhelming force of tragic politics.",1450742400,,3373,5.214417744916821
