8520680,5,B007PTZXLU,"Heard Michael Wigge deliver his presentation and answer questions live last evening, and read his book cover to cover today.  I feel it necessary to respond to the minority (n = 2) of one-star criticisms and sarcasm posted herein.
Let's consider the criticisms:
""If you're looking for practical information, don't waste your time.""  Both book and video present many practical hints, but not in a bullet-point format.  His many cautions about researching all aspects of travel and options ahead of time, avoiding a few hazardous parts of the world, and other practical hints are buried in the light humor and breezy tone of his book and presentation.
""As a comedy, it still is a waste of money.""  Neither book nor presentation / video rival the work of Peter Sellers, Steve Martin, or others for outright laughs.  But unlike carefully produced hollywood humor, the humor herein is based on human interactions, and certainly more entertaining and humorous than any of a dozen or more current television ""comedies"" I could name.
""...scam artist...scumbag...parasitic methods...garbage....""  This sort of shallow insulting comment masquerading as a ""review"" has no place on this website.  It adds nothing to the understanding of this video or book, other than to state that one individual has been offended by the content.
My take:  I know individuals who travel around the world for a minute fraction of the cost of my travel.  I choose not to travel without ample resources, and if I tried to do so, would fare poorly and become disillusioned quickly.  But other more entertaining, gregarious, and trusting souls manage well on the road with little or no monetary resources.  They are not ""scumbags,"" nor do they employ ""parasitic methods.""  Some can be mildly manipulative in their personal interactions, but this is behavior far from ""parasitic.""  Parasites neither entertain, nor share seemingly irrational quests with strangers who are free to refuse to donate resources, free to walk away.
The majority of individuals I've met traveling to the far corners of the earth without resources have been genuinely nice, inquisitive, and sometimes heedless of the potential risks involved.  I have neither freely provided resources to all who approach me, nor felt like I was in the presence of ""parasitic scumbags.""  I've admired individuals traveling in a trusting and open manner, relying upon the kindness of strangers, and enjoying the open road in a manner I personally am hesitant to do.
Wigge has made a little money off his presentations.  I appreciated that in doing so he has entertained and informed people.  His video is a little heavy on ""trick"" photography...ultra wide angle lenses, cuts in continuity resulting in vehicles and people ""jumping ahead"" in a jerky fashion, and other manipulations taught in cinematography courses.  His book contains a few minor errors in translation:  when clearly referring to the high cost of living in Hawaii, he refers to it as ""the high standard of living.""  These criticisms amount to minor issues.
I heard no one in the audience last evening use the words ""parasite"" or ""scam artist.""  I saw many literally shake their heads at the audacity of the man and what he had accomplished, and saw many smiles and heard significant applause.",1507680000,,3283,5.110486891385768

8520684,5,B007PTZXLU,"I saw Michael Wigge's ""How to Travel the World for FREE"" on TV the other day and was just impressed. So I got the DVD right away because I wanted to know if he would make it to the end of the world without a penny in his pocket. I was tickled to see all the crazy things this German reporter did to get some money or free food and accommodation. On the other side I suffered with him when he tried to be a porter, carrying the tourists' stuff all the way to Machu Picchu. In the end, the series about his travel from Europe to Antarctica is really inspiring and one gets some real nice insights into different cultures. It shows that traveling and getting to know different cultures does not have to depend on how much money one has. Now I really want to see Peru, Chile and Argentina! I'm sure, although I know now how Michael Wigge's adventure ends, I will watch the DVD again in the future! Just great entertainment!",1338249600,2,919,4.257142857142857
8520685,5,B007PTZXLU,"Wigge is an adventurer like you've never seen before as he manages to travel to the end of he world for free!! If you are a fan of his previous adventures or a first time watcher, you will be sure to laugh and be amazed by this journey. I often found myself wondering if I could pull off such a task, but let's leave that to Wigge!!! Unique and quite an interesting human story.",1338163200,,378,4.121621621621622
8520686,5,B007PTZXLU,"I had such a blast watching this series. Wigge travels the world for free and films everything on his own-how to get free food, free accommodation and free travel. On top of this, he films funny stunts like the 'human sofa' and 'pillow fighting' in order to get free tickets to his next destination. This series also had a lot of beautiful sceneries and interesting landscapes of eleven counties including Antartica.",1338163200,,416,4.873239436619718
