5737579,4,B00CS7PHPQ,"Has three previously released Blu-ray single disks, edited to fit on a single disk. It doesn't make for a bad purchase because if you didn't buy the single disks you will be stunned by the natural beauty that was captured in HD. No new footage, but still glorious.",1378425600,2,264,4.520833333333333
5737580,5,B00CS7PHPQ,"First I have to say, I'm a huge fan of Sunrise Earth which used to air in the mornings on Discovery HD Theater before it became the Velocity channel. I own all the Sunrise Earth releases and often spend a weekend morning with a Sunrise Earth blu-ray and a cup of coffee. The aim of these programs is to provide an as-if-you-were-there-at-sunrise experience in super clear HD with only ambient sound. No music, no voice-over, just as close to a first-hand experience as possible.
After watching Gaiam's preview video, my guess is that this blu-ray will be a re-package of four previously released Sunrise Earth episodes, ""Island First Light"" (Acadia National Park, Maine), ""Yellowstone Geysers"", ""Yosemite Dawn"" and ""Everglades: River of Grass"". These are all excellent Sunrise Earth episodes, visually stunning in gorgeous HD. I recommend this video to anyone who doesn't already own these episodes.
I am also HOPING that this disk will include ""High Desert Arches"" (Arches National Park) as the cover suggests and perhaps the Morning Drive episode featuring Acadia National Park. I will update this review once I receive it.

Also sending out a plea to Gaia to offer on blu-ray, or on Amazon Instant, the rest of the 27 Sunrise Earth episodes that were never released, most especially the ""Viewer's Choice"" episodes from Season 5. These episodes are too good to keep in a vault somewhere. Thanks to Gaia, Discovery and Compass Light for these amazing programs.

UPDATE:  I received my copy today and, yes, this blu-ray is a re-package that includes the following episodes: ""Island First Light"" (Acadia National Park, Maine), ""Yellowstone Geysers"", ""Yosemite Dawn"" and ""Everglades: River of Grass"". No other content is included. My recommendation is that if you do not already own these episodes, then please pick up this blu-ray today. The presentation is stunning with top-notch HD photography and these are some of the very best Sunrise Earth episodes.
But while I am excited that a new Sunrise Earth blu-ray has been released, I am disappointed that all the episodes on this disc have been previously released. Discovery and Gaiam missed an opportunity here to include some episodes that long-time fans of this show would like to own, particularly ""High Desert Arches"" which, strangely, is pictured on the (very nice) cover but is not included. Even one new episode would probably have enticed fans who own all the previous releases to buy this one as well. Here's hoping this new package sells well, creates many new Sunrise Earth fans, and that Gaiam will follow up this release with more either on disc or through Amazon Instant.",1374969600,26,2636,5.041284403669724

8585641,3,B00CS7PHPQ,Got this for my parents. They have a tv over their fireplace that they like to put pictures and slideshows.
