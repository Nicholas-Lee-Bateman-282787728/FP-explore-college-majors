8763048,1,B01GJQWZEW,Bunch of giggling twits. Not worth looking at let alone pay for.,1488758400,2,64,4.416666666666667
8763049,5,B01GJQWZEW,Very nice.,1479168000,,10,4.5
8763050,5,B01GJQWZEW,The quality is great. Everything came intact. I like these movies. The end with the girl pulling down her fruit of the loom underwear was a bit strange but still a good buy.,1399075200,,173,4.2727272727272725
8763051,3,B01GJQWZEW,"What we have here is a DVD for the person who likes mainly Flashing. There is hardly any scene that lasts more than two minutes and most are of the Wham Bam thank you maam type. There is more flashing above the waist than below but there's several below. Most flashing, above and below is pretty good. There is one scene,the longest of the DVD, of a girl on a swing exploring herself. It holds your attention but again it is rather short. Most of the action is in discos and rooms adjacent to them (because the music is still loud)or in parking lots with damn few on campus in spite of the title. If you like mostly flashing this one is your baby.",1207699200,,647,4.225806451612903
8763052,5,B01GJQWZEW,"I own most of the GGW videos, and I have to say that this is hands-down their best work.  There is everything you'd expect - cute (mostly) college-aged girls taking it off for beads or a GGW tank-top, but the guys behind the camera are more experienced in cutting the ""deals"" than ever before.  They often get the girls to show for longer, and do it over and over, claiming everything from, they weren't ready, or their hands were in the way, etc.  Plenty of stuff inside clubs, in the bathrooms of clubs, and out on the street.  Just enough talking to the girls before and after they flash, fleshing them out as ""real girls."" (All the really showy ones had southern accents, which is interesting!)  But the best part about this video is just how often they get girls to ""show it all.""  There are several segments where the camera lens ventures up a dress or a skirt, or just plain gets girls to drop it all in front of groups of guys!  I get the feeling that the GGW crew takes their best stuff and puts it together and makes the rest of the videos with the remaining footage.  However, don't be fooled by the title.  Most of the footage was shot on what seemed like Spring Breaks throughout Florida, not on college campuses.  There is one scene near the end of the video, previewed on the box art and on the commerical, that features the Hottie of all hotties on a swing.  It is not to be missed!  Get this title now!",1045180800,15,1419,4.313207547169811
8763053,2,B01GJQWZEW,"I don't know how the other girls gone wild movies are, but this Girls Gone Wild ON CAMPUS isn't all that good. It has a FEW good shots of girls showing up or taking off their skirts and showing good shots. But mostly this is basicly different girls flashing the camara for like 5 seconds. I'd say this is just for something to watch at a bachelor/frat type of party where its just you and your boys watching while rating girls. I'd say RENT THIS if you can.",1042070400,2,457,4.204545454545454
8763054,3,B01GJQWZEW,"This DVD shows the standard Girls Gone Wild formula, which is some guys using digital video cameras and catching girls flashing. It's cool for a little while, but the flashing shots are so quick and hearing girls scream, then the crowd scream... I think they have a newer video that come out this month called America's Wildest Bachelor Parties that's hotter.",1040688000,,359,4.901639344262295
