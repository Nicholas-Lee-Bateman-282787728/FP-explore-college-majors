I really wish it were on CD so I could take it in the car with me.  Fr McBride explains some of the unusual terms such as, trumpets, blood, beast AS common language in use at the time, that applied to John's subject. To me they now seem like visual poetry of a type.  The terms were not to cause fear but used among the Christians of that day.  Examples: ""His (Jesus') eyes glowed with fire, meant nothing would escape his penetrating glance, ""the term churches refers to the Christian communities in the 7 cities and these were ""house"" churches; the 7 stars and 7 lampstands could mean ""as stars they can be angelic messengers to the full church, as lampstands they can be the light of faith to all believers."" The Churches held their meetings in secrecy for safety purposes. Also, the question, ""why do people die"" is answered by the symbol of ""The Tree of Life"".  They were now deprived of the food of immortiality, ""what the Greeks called ""ambrosia."" The Fathers of the Church considered the Cross the real Tree of Life, the source of eternal life.""  This explains to us the Eucharist, or some say Communion Service. We remember our God's sacrifice on the cross and we know we are being fed by God Himself, the food of imortiality, the old symbolic in the dessert was ""Manna"" and what the Greeks called ""ambrosia"", the immortial food is the ""Body and Blood of Christ"" our Eucharistic meal.  Truly, reading this book or hearing this DVD brings you a blessing as the Book of Revelations states!  If you are a Christian, this teaching by Fr McBride will bless your heart! It is really a nice book for both Catholic and Protestants.",1299283200,4,1753,4.504731861198739
