8712476,5,B00W7GTHEU,"I can't believe Ennio Porrino has managed to stay under my opera radar for so long.  ""I Shardana"" picks up folklore from Sardinia, It is is a mixed media production with echoes of Oedypus Rex in its use of ritiualized puppets, bit both of Stravinsky and Carl Orff, and plenty of Wagner, but the result is completely original.  .  Most of the cast is is Sardinian-born, including the phenomenal Paoletta Marrocu, whom I have had the pleasure of encountering in other DVD's.  let me say it will keep it on the edge of your seat; one of the most amazing ""total operas"" I have witnessed.  Fantastic production, fantastic voices.  The libretto?  Well, when all is said and do, quite trite: two boys, one girl, and everyone dies.  But what a way to go!!!!! Kudos to Davide Livermore, the Director; Marco Nateri, the costume designer and the  rest of the crew who made this production possible.  By the way, I am right now listening to my first Porrino CD.",1438473600,6,949,4.595238095238095
