3564111,4,6302637635,There's alot of good information in this series. The cgi effects are outstanding too. You get the inside of view of the animals too. The only downside here is that due to budget limitations you see the same shots over and over. This was not a big budget bbc affair though so they did that to save money. However the information you get makes it worth it. If you can't listen to the different facts without seeing new footage you will join the one star reviewers. I would try to rent this one as it is very repetitive in footage.  This was in hd on tv and that's how I saw this one from amazon.com prime. they stream it to you for being a member of that service.,1351641600,2,661,4.1640625
3564112,5,6302637635,"We've been watching this on the TV, so its been a real pleasure to be able to pop on something this educational while I'm cooking tea or doing the laundry. The only problem is that I can't keep up with all the questions I'm being bombarded with ! I think I may just have to watch this myself :D",1347840000,,294,4.0
3564113,2,6302637635,"The main problem with this series is the repetitiveness.  Each episode reuses the same footage over and over and over.  You think to yourself, ""No! they can't show that AGAIN"", but yes they do...twenty more times.  We see the same dino take the same poop (for no reason & unrelated to the narration) at least 7 times--or more--I lost count. I started to cringe from seeing the same footage repeated.  Then, the only dinos featured are basically the T-rex, a really large planteater, a raptor, triceratops, & one flying dino--that's it.  By episode 2 you still have the same dinos & same footage.  They repeat each point about 10 times in each episode by slightly varying the words or who says it. Lazy writing.  Then, in the next episode, they repeat it again!  These guys know how to bust out a thesaurus! It would have been better to do episode one: just planteater, epidode 2: just t-rex, episode 3: raptor vs. flying dino, etc. than repeat the same info to death.

Also, they make it seem like t-rex was only eating triceratops! Unlikely, especially given the inherent danger of attacking triceratops & potentially being mortally wounded. There were so many types of easier prey, sick & older animals, & carrion that T-Rex was after. So, some inconsistencies & information is biased based upon what the producers could ""show"" based on very limited reels.  I would have preferred more information, showing more paleontologists, more fossils, etc., than see the same cgi scenes on a loop.

I got bored. Wanted to love it; but it's just too lazy.  Walking with Dinos is much better.",1342828800,3,1583,4.779411764705882
3564114,4,6302637635,"I give this show a 4 only on my belief that t-rex ran similarly to a raptor, and didn't have the legs they give them now. Of course they won't run fast! You straitened out their legs way too much! And key word, equilibrium, I believe t-rex had great balance between its head and tail, and its legs, similar to a raptor, can run at great speeds. However, this was a cool show!",1339977600,,375,4.1506849315068495
3564115,4,6302637635,"I recognize that some of the criticisms of this product are credible, but this work also has substantial strengths as well as occasional shortcomings.  My favorite episode is ""the Defenders"" which has a lot to say about armored dinosaurs and ceratopsians like triceratops.  It also has the distinguished paleontologist Bob Bakker presenting his theories about the hadrasaur, parasaurolaphus using infrasound in herds as a unified defense against a predator.  While this theory is too good not to include, I do not believe it has a large following yet. Another scene involving combat between a Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops is particularly realistic and includes fight sequences based on important fossil evidence outlined in Gregory Paul's THE PRINCETON FIELD GUIDE TO DINOSAURS.  Specifically, this fight scene includes the T-rex tactic of biting and breaking the Triceratops's horns to disarm it and struggling to prevent the other animal from spearing it in the process. It is also worth noting that the discovery of this tactic is an important data point indicating that Tyrannosaurs were not simply scavengers as has sometimes been postulated (if the interpretation of the fossils is correct).  No need to break the horns on a dead carcass if that is your meal for the day. Future fossil finds may help to clarify this issue since we have only one example of such a fight (that I know of).  In the meantime, I strongly recommend this series especially at the ridiculously low price.",1337385600,5,1489,5.132231404958677

 And Dr Themos R. Holtz jr.  basically i can not stand to hear his voice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A do not buy as far as i am concerned.

3564119,5,6302637635,"I have been interested in dinosaurs for many years and go fossil hunting as one of my hobbies.  I have all of the decent (and not so decent) dinosaur DVDs that are out there. This one, I tell you assuredly, is one of the best.  The format is a lot like the Jurassic Fight Club set... and it even has some of the same paleontologists giving comments and insights as did Jurassic Fight Club; this is fortunate, as I feel that they are extremely interesting and radiate their enthusiasm, helping one to be all the more appreciative of these amazing creatures.  A good number of the dino animation is rehashed within the four episodes (just like Jurassic Fight Club reused dino footage); but enough new material, of new dino types, is thrown in such that it still makes for great viewing pleasure.  The previous reviewer did not like the same material being used and would rather have fewer episodes with less repetition.  I like it the way it is... because new information and new insights are provided throughout, and the computer simulations are so good that I enjoy watching them again.  Realistically speaking, one cannot expect endless episodes with all new simulations in each... as the Discovery Channel and any other outfit has budget restraints and limitations just like with any production company.
  This is a very well thought out production and I was pleased about it in many respects.  I'm a vegetarian, and it was excellent how this set elaborated on how the vegetarian dinosaurs coped with the onslaught from the carnivores. The carnivorous dinosaurs often risked their lives while engaging with the plant eaters; often they would be injured and even killed by them.  T-rex wasn't always the king... despite how cool and classy the tyrannosaurs were!  I've seen other films suggesting things such as that Triceratops horns were not useful as weapons against predators... that they were mainly for display.  This set puts that ludicrous idea out... and does a splendid job in numerous other areas as well! Bravo!
  It's a good thing that that asteroid finally hit... otherwise we would still all be hiding under rocks and logs!  ;)",1282780800,17,2143,4.865013774104683

3564122,1,6302637635,"Easily one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. Easily THE worst dinosaur special I've ever seen. CGI scenes are used over and over and over until it is nauseating. And then to mix it up they show it again but flip the screen so the T-rex comes in from the left instead of the right but it is still the EXACT SAME SCENE!
And then there's the science. Many times they will will reference one dinosaur (example...Tyrannosaurus) and discuss something about his anatomy while showing someone working on the skull of an Allosaur or Acrocanthosaur.
Then there is the bad, out dated and exaggerated science. The comments of Matt Wedel (one of the scientists they referenced) were cut and pasted to say the exact opposite of what he really said in order to make Sauroposeidon sound more fantastic for the show. He even launched an online petition against the show due to it's deliberate deception. The narrator couldn't pronounce ""Parasaurolophus"". And by the end we learned that Sauropods have two brains, Parasaurolophus had sonic powers like Banshee from the X-men and Quetzalcoatlus had heat vision like the Predator movies. It was not science or educational. It was a hodge-podge of bad fantasy.",1421798400,3,1198,4.906403940886699

3564158,3,6302637635,"This series has some strong points -- authoritative and entertaining ""talking heads"", some of the acknowledged expert paleontologists of today (including Kenneth Carpenter, Bob Bakker, Mark Norell, and others); some very impressive animated anatomical footage; analyses of hunting, defense, and breeding strategies, and (my favorite part) computer-animated dinosaurs.

The problem?  This series commits a serious sin: The animated footage -- which is pretty much de rigeur for a modern dinosaur show -- is repeated, over and over and over.  Not just from one episode to the next, but even within them.  In the first episode alone, you can see nearly every bit of animation at LEAST four times -- probably more, but I didn't count them all.  I started the second episode, hoping to see new animations -- and saw the same ten or so clips used in the first!  And while the animation is pretty good, it has an unusual style -- lots of extreme closeups (with a virtual wide-angle lens), frequently low angles backlit by a low sun, and an overexposed, washed-out look that rarely gives the ""nature video"" feel of productions like ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" or ""Planet Dinosaur"".

Basically, this series feels like they didn't have the budget for a lot of dino animation, so they decided to pay for a little of it, and used it over and over.  Given an apparent budgetary constraint, I suppose it's better to get a little good animation than a lot of bad animation.

(In what is probably another cost-saving measure, the scene purporting to show Sauroposeidon hatchlings apparently used the adult models, scaled down -- ignoring the natural differences of proportion between adults and young.)

In summary, I have to agree with another reviewer who said not to watch all four episodes in one evening.  While I wouldn't mind a half hour watching this now and then, on the whole ""Clash of the Dinosaurs"" one hour of material stretched into four 45-minute episodes.  Because of this, despite its strengths, it doesn't make my list of top dino videos.",1359417600,4,2037,4.976401179941003

I also recommend Dinosaur Revolution but the only part I really love is the end called T-Rex and it has lots of grat battles but they are really violent and really bloody, I mean they go all out on the final chapter in blood and it is also vary sad in one part of it so I would not recommend it for children to watch it. I would say my favourite movie would hands down be Speckles the Tarbosaurus and it goes by a mother name as well called Dino Long an Amazing Adventure. It is a movie filled with action and tragedy, Speckles first grate tragedy is vary sad and I would not let children see this movie it is so sad for me that I was sad for three days because of this movie and I was 18 years old, I also love DINOSAURS so that is one reason I was very sad and I love animals I consider them like humans we all came from God so we are special to be alive and I know evolelution comes not exist to it Mack's no sense when our body's perfectly relocated our DNA so how can it happen and how does DINOSAURS being warm blooded die out from cold when cold blooded animals did not die out andcyes if evolution did exsist frogs were around then so yes there were warm blooded animals on earth at the time so it makes no sense because how can that be if a warm blooded animals died out from freezing to death but could blooded animals did not there is something rone there with that,it because Satten also know as Slanderer Depressor, wants any one to atlest not serve him not even a little so that he can tack you down with him because he knows his time is short also the bible never said that the Earth would be distroed itsaid the would be a new earth and a new hevens figuratively speaking of corse and humans will be redirected on earth as well.
