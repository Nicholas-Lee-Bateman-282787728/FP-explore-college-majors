6879149,5,B00QT4VDSO,I really don't understand how Amazon prime has seasons 1-3 included in your subscription but the fourth season you have to buy... That makes no sense whatsoever!!!!! I'm not paying for something that should be included with my membership!! So I went to another site to see the whole season for free!! It was a good season! I wasn't really feeling the end cause to me there wasn't enough build up for the whole'Korrasami' thing! Besides that it was very good!!,1487030400,,459,4.679012345679013
6879150,3,B00QT4VDSO,"I can't believe these series could disappoint but here it is. Don't know what went wrong. Looks like extreme budget cut for production. Story meh, older scenes reused in extremely creepy manner (i.e. manga style), a lot of stupid scenes just to fill up the time, a bit too much violence and doom.",1487030400,,296,4.60377358490566

6879154,5,B00QT4VDSO,"This is the final installment of the Korra series and it ends very well. There are some uncharacteristic plot lines--designed to seal the series up nicely, I think, but it's all done well.  And like all of Avatar, this season portrays complex social, political, and ethical concepts in age appropriate ways.
No spoilers for those a half-decade behind.
If you or your children are into the Avatar series, then the DVD contents are known to you as awesome.  If you have a daughter interested in being awesome--I'll say that this final chapter highlights the abilities and struggles of at least eight hardcore ladies (Beifongs x4, Asami, Zhu Li, Korra, and Kuvira with a bit of cameo work in Katara)--and it's so worth it for your little girl to see AND SONS too!! But all girls need a shero (or 8).  This season pulls us back to the first heroine in the Last Airbender, opening with Katara and Korra working together; moving through the difficult and realistic struggles among generations of the Beifong women and ending with Korra upending an aggressor very much like her.
Watch it with your kids AFTER you watch the Last Airbender and then the first three seasons of this.  I'll tell you--putting in the time watching these shows is worth it.  It's not garbage.  And that moment you're snuggling on the couch before bedtime with your kids and Korra wanders into the swamp in episode 2 (series 41), you'll all gasp together and stay up past bedtime just to watch episode 3.  Make that moment happen in your life.

It comes with a poster of Korra in the avatar state, kids are over the moon about it.",1484697600,3,1598,4.661921708185053

6879217,5,B00QT4VDSO,"I'm glad I finished this series - didn't think I ever would amidst the horror that was Book Two.

-Most believable villain of the series, though disappointing and ridiculous at the end.
The bending looks a lot less like boxing and appears more specific to each element.
Some of the sci-fi elements are a little....much - and a tad jarring, but I got over it.
Unfortunately, the populace of Republic City is still non-existent. However the major characters are enjoyable, and most of the voice acting was strong. Great to see a few of our old friends from the Last Airbender series.

Korra's personality improved dramatically once she finally grew up. She was only obnoxious a few times. I doubt I'll ever be her biggest fan, but I don't despise her anymore. The Avatar state still leaves a lot to be desired, but at least it added a little kick this time around. That said, as in the last three Books, the creators conspired against Korra to make her as weak and ineffectual as possible. All I can think is that they were never entirely comfortable with a strong female protagonist so they contrived idiotic ways to make her struggle.

As far as this whole supposed, ""shocking lesbian scene,"" at the end that started some people foaming with rage, and others gushing glitters and sparkly lights - I think people chose to see what they wanted to see. What I saw was two very good friends. I'm pleased that the creators opted to let the curtains fall on two independent and adventurous young heroines, instead of assigning each one with her obligatory man. As always, society is quick to pass judgment on the intentions of others one way or the other - sad, and pitiful, but that won't ever change.

I rated the rest of this series very poorly because at the time I believed the creators made some really moronic and horrible decisions - mostly in the way they constructed Korra. Succumbing to the clich of a flawed character may be alright, but any idiot can make a character as shallow and surface flawed as she was in the first two Books. No, that's not fair. An idiot would've done a better job. Good writers trust the intelligence of their audience enough to let them work out deep rooted flaws. Lousy writers like these either lack the skill to develop characters with profound natural flaws, or they think their patrons are so stupid they have to slather flaws on in thick layers with a double wide brush.

It's possible that other idiots appreciate the resulting simplicity, but anyone with half an ounce of perspicacity and imagination is going to resent it....deeply.

I'm still dismayed by this series as a whole, but the Fourth Book almost makes me want to go back and try to view Korra in a new light...almost. Better yet, I think I'll get rid of the first three books and just rewatch this one again someday.",1474070400,,2820,4.63
6879218,5,B00QT4VDSO,"A great conclusion to an excellent animated series! Book Four finds our protagonist dealing with the long term planning and strategic minded Kuvira, a natural leader and master metal-bender.  Korra finds herself at a crossroads: she is physically and emotionally weighed down by her defeat at the hands of Sahir from Book Three.

Her new adversary challenges her beliefs in leadership.  We've seen how ineffective emperors, governors and mayors can be; what if it's necesarry to rally behind a strong leader and that leader determines she'd be the best ruler in a new empire? What of she's rigth? Kuvira is smart, strong, patriotic and is an adaptor of new technolgy that gives her advantages in many areas.

Korra has to overcome her own weakness of character, of being manipulated by others, and become stronger than ever before to confront Kuvira and her mechanized army, whose goal is to conquer the last free province in all of Earth Kingdom: Republic City!",1473897600,,962,4.99375

6879223,4,B00QT4VDSO,"For Avatar fans: Korra doesn't have quite the heart or the range of younger moments that the original series does. It's a little more action, and the seasons are separate so there isn't a true 60-episode arc. But it keeps most of the all-around quality, and the fights are good.",1471824000,,278,4.58
6879224,5,B00QT4VDSO,"This show is absolutely fantastic. Season 3 and 4 are especially epic. Korra is such an amazing character. She's a true hero that young girls can really look up to. Someone who's strong yet vulnerable. Korra's a complex heroine for people of all ages to root for.

And to all the homophobes down voting this simply because Korra and Asami ended up together; you're disgusting and awful wastes of space. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in cartoons aimed at kids and young adults. There are kids who are lgbt and they deserve to have representation too. Showing children that lgbt people exist doesn't affect their sexuality you ignorant cretins.",1470355200,,688,4.982608695652174

6879237,2,B00QT4VDSO,"I loved the first Avatar series but somehow Korra annoys me through all the seasons. I also did not like how every season they had an end of the world villain instead of building it up to the last season like the first Avatar.

The last season was the worst since it had no build up to the villain and the ending left a lot of holes. This was almost as bad as the movie version of the Last Air Bender.",1468713600,,401,3.950617283950617

6879244,1,B00QT4VDSO,"This trend started in Book 3, but it really made itself known here. Korra is sidelined in a show where she's the title character. And then they pair her with a character who had even less of an arc then she did (but representation, I guess).

6879360,5,B00QT4VDSO,"The final chapter of the Avatar saga ties up loose ends that I wasn't even aware existed in the story. While some traditional families would cringe at one of the directions the story goes, I found it to be very heartwarming after the season started off so emotionally cold and harsh that I doubted the protagonist's ability to recover.

No doubt remains that the story of Korra is a legend, and that the writers knew how to put this story to rest for good well before it wore out its welcome, leaving loyal fans loyal and new fans asking for more. I suggest keeping an eye on these people and whatever beautiful work of art they are planning to create next.

Some would mention, however, that the story of Korra is darker than the story of Aang, the last airbender. My counter to this popular argument is that The Last Airbender is a tale for a somewhat younger audience and that The Legend of Korra is a tale that arrived on time because the fans of The Last Airbender have grown up.",1451952000,6,984,4.4010989010989015

6879370,5,B00QT4VDSO,"We watched this as Nick.com released the episodes and we were always excited to see the next one so I was glad to get the DVDs.  The whole series is well done.  Good art and music, good story telling with good plot and character development.  My kids ages 3-12 love watching it.  Season 4 is particularly about recovery and healing finding balance.  My husband and I love watching this with our kids.  My kids always pick the climatic episodes to watch when they have to pick just one episode but they love every episode.

I know some people might enjoy this show with older kids and not want younger kids to watch because of the violence.  A primary focus of the series is the magic of ""bending"" elements.  The creators collaborated with martial arts specialist to create the different styles of bending they are used for fighting a lot in the stories.  They do not use blood and gore and the bending is used to capture or subdue or escape but not to kill with only one notable exception in Season 3.  In that case the violence was not actually shown but we know that the victim was murdered by suffocation.  The story clearly defines the choices that are bad (and the people who are doing them are the enemy) and good by the way the main characters react.  They also show how people can choose to change and make better choices and live better lives.  The main characters are not perfect people and they apologize to each other for their mistakes as well.",1448668800,,1457,4.46969696969697

6879400,5,B00QT4VDSO,"A fantastic finish to a fantastic series. If you have avoided Legend of Korra because you think it is a ""kid's show"", you should really give it a try. Sure, there are the occasional gags that are meant to make the kids laugh and some of the characters are obviously meant to make the show more enjoyable for a young audience, but the show as a whole has a very mature tone and covers a good deal of mature topics. Not to mention that, in the end... well... if you don't already know how it ends, I won't spoil it, but let's just say it is a watershed event in the history of children's television in the US.

Watching the fourth season on BluRay really opened my eyes to the artistry of the show. I watched the other three seasons on Prime and I thought they were very well done artistically. Seeing the difference between HD streaming and BluRay made me want to watch the rest of the series on BluRay!

Cons:  There are some political ramblings about this series on the Internet, esp. from the LGBT crowd, that this series ends with a nod to them.  I believe that is a subjective interpretation of the events in the show, but take it how you want.  Either way it does not diminish the series itself.

Thoughts:  If you are interested in this, you may want to also pick up the first series to see how it all started: ""Avatar:  The Last Airbender""
Together they form an excellent story with great characters, a beautiful world to explore and learn about, and storytelling which rivals some of the greats.  Enjoy!",1445731200,,686,4.549180327868853
6879405,2,B00QT4VDSO,"Background: I'm a MAJOR A:TLA fan who also enjoyed LoK in books 1 & 3.  Lin Beifong is probably my favorite Korra character; the problems of the more modernized world were realistic; the story continuation from Avatar was well done (would've liked much more of it, but hey, I'll take Zuko on a dragon at any age!!); I understood why Mako acted the way he did (which some viewers, perhaps younger, more privileged ones, seem to have had trouble doing), etc.  That said, here's a list of my biggest problems with this disappointing final season.  (Spoilers follow:)

1. Time jumps ahead... and Korra's friends seem to have deserted her at the lowest point of her life.  Don't know about you, but if a super-close friend, someone I love, is trying to recover from devastating injuries -- and I haven't heard from her after repeated contact attempts -- I GO VISIT HER.  If she still shuts me out, I talk to her relatives/caregivers to find out what's going on.  So this years-long gap where Mako, Bolin, and Asami -- TEAM AVATAR -- are clueless and absent during Korra's hard recovery is just too much for me to swallow.  The deep focus on friendship in both Avatar series makes the premise of being ""too busy with their own lives"" simply wrong.  Sky bison and airships are readily available for transport, and Katara, at least, should be concerned enough about Korra to contact her friends and ask them to be at her side once in a while.

2. Kuvira, and her robot and army, don't work well as the villains.  I'd expect to see them in other animated kids' series, in Doctor Who, in Marvel movies... but I found myself bored and frustrated with this kind of villain in this kind of series.  Been there, done that.  Slight variations on this overdone theme aren't enough to make it interesting here.

3. Girl/girl relationships are more than fine with me, and I don't have a problem with ANY kind of unexpected attraction showing up in a series... but there's a very important issue that I do need to bring up.  Please give this point serious thought rather than jumping to inaccurate conclusions.  With all the stereotyping and bullying that young girls have to deal with in real life, having a strong, athletic, courageous, tough, assertive female main character turn out to (also) be attracted to girls does perpetuate a very real, very problematic stereotype.  I speak from personal experience.  Most female athletes happen to be straight.  Most strong women are too.  Many are not, but it can be helpful to young girls (and other people) who identify with Korra to see a character like her exist on a modern television show and still be straight.  And girls who are not only athletic, but mechanically inclined like Asami -- girls who like cars and airplanes and want to run a business -- again, you see my point.  Yes, you can argue that Kuvira is strong too and SHE'S straight, thereby providing balance... you can add that Toph is as well... but neither is a main character of the series.  It would've been better to see Korra and Asami struggle with their feelings earlier in the series -- and also have another forceful female character developing a good, solid relationship with a decent guy who was okay with her strength, rather than having to (for example) settle for Varrick.  So many failed relationships in this series involved strong women; the relationships that survived involved more subservient women.  THAT is one major subconscious message to young girls I'm concerned about.

4. I really, really wanted certain family ties to be revealed: I wanted Korra to be Sokka's granddaughter (I'll always believe she is; all evidence points to yes); I wanted Sokka to be Su's father (refer to last parenthetical comment above); I wanted Mako and Bolin to be tied to Zuko's family (holding out hope for this in the Avatar graphic novels).  The creators did say that at one time they planned for many Korra characters to be related to Avatar ones but decided against it.  Anyone know if any of these relationships have been officially confirmed...?

So... those were my primary frustrations, and they were simply too massive to dismiss.  (BTW, any negative ""hater"" comments will be ignored, so don't waste your time posting them.)  Again, although books 1 & 3 aren't perfect, they are excellent and can easily be enjoyed without books 2 & 4, IMHO.  Happy viewing... and ladies: never be afraid to be your own strong female character!!",1445040000,8,4441,4.764705882352941

6879425,4,B00QT4VDSO,"Before I even watched this season, I accidentally came upon a spoiler that was supposed to happen at the end of this season, and it is something that I don't agree is right. I finally watched this season, hoping that it wouldn't be like everybody made it sound, and upon finishing the season, I confirmed that it only hints at what everybody says happened. I know that even the creators are saying that it is cannon, but only hinting at something, doesn't make it cannon in my opinion. I believe that for something to be cannon, it has to be confirmed through the actual product, and not through interviews afterward, and since it didn't make it 100% clear in the show, I can easily ignore it if I want, and enjoy the show. So if anybody has heard about the ending that I'm not going to spoil, and is afraid of watching it, I just want to let you know that it isn't so clear that you have to accept it, but if you still feel uncomfortable, you may have to skip the season, or at least after the battle in the last show.
 I know there are supposed to be comic books that follow after the show, and so they might make it cannon, but I don't read many comic books anyway, so that doesn't bother me much.
 Besides that, this season was pretty cool, even if it wasn't quite as climatic as Season 2 was. It has an epic final battle, that I won't spoil, and it gives Varrick and even his almost unknown assistant Zhu Li.
 So it is my opinion that Korra is a great follow up to Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I hope to see the next Avatar in someday. Preferably in the 80's.",1442620800,,1567,4.216666666666667

That is, my suspension of disbelief was horribly taxed. As an example, without spoiling the story: the rival party comes up with a technology in a matter of days that they hadn't had any progress on after a number of years. This is accomplished after kicking out their smartest scientist. There are a few things like that.

That and the last episode left me scratching my head for a number of reasons. Generally stated, if they had been trying to get a larger fan base and extend the series and they were out of ideas their actions would have been dumb but made sense. Instead the series is ending, so what they did in the end gave me the impression that their creative wells had run dry.

6879490,2,B00QT4VDSO,"As my review for Book Three covered, the Blu-Ray release feels like a half-hearted attempt at best.

It doesn't help that the series decides to completely give up at this point. There is a basically meaningless time skip between seasons that causes a lot of hurried flashbacks. The infamous clips episode is found in this season and, I hate to admit it, but it at least has imagination.

My ire, newly kindled from Season Three's mishandling of the concept of attachment, was kindled anew as Korra manages to get her butt handed to her constantly by the minor characters. If you want a villain to feel like a real rival, then characterization should happen AS that character does things, not as others talk about them, AND CERTAINLY NOT IN FLASHBACKS!

At some point, Season 3 supervillain makes an appearance and finally starts acting the part he was assigned ages ago. It gave me the slightest hope that the finale wouldn't be a pile of disappointment.

I will just come out and say it. They decided to have a giant robot that runs on steam, switches and, most importantly, unicorn giggles. A giant BIPEDAL robot. This pushes the limits of the steam punk crap that has been shoved down the audiences collective throat hitherto. The amount of platinum ever mined in the real world would fit snugly inside the average living room (thanks, Google). In this cannon, minor character turned She-Hitler has somehow magically found enough to make a stories tall giant robot. No! I am not going to deal with it!

You would be forgiven, if you have a marvelous working memory and recall the ending of Season 2, thinking that perhaps Korra will become giant spirit Korra and battle the robot in a tokusatsu style scene to wrap up the series nicely in a battle of technology vs spirituality, balance vs absolutes, individuality vs control, you beautiful person you. Of course, you may also be imagining that the writing staff hadn't taken a break from reality, but as the robot can not only balance itself on only two legs with no means of correction except the pilots that are, inexplicably, kept on the top of it's head, this also will let you down. The thing would topple. There, I said it. This thing wouldn't even work WITH the magic they claim is fueling it. The design and implementation is just so bad. To bump it up a notch, the robot triangulates signals of all types without either acknowledging how different the waves are it is searching for or having a second point of reference to do the actual triangulation.

At this point, I am glad we are done here. The Last Airbender was a triumph of story telling, character building, and pacing. This series seems to be banking on that report. The writing staff seems to have came up with the points they wanted to make before making the plots, making more preachy than I thought possible.",1435449600,,2835,4.682730923694779

6879508,1,B00QT4VDSO,"It's no surprise that today's world you gotta face a lot of degenerative topics, but undoubtedly one of the worst of all is adult content and children's TV shows. The season started off with a girl trying to master the elements, channel spirituality, and maintain balance and peace. However season 4 took a turn for the worse when they decided to add the""were here ""and... you know what mantra!  It just gets plain creepy in the very last minute of the show, when aksami and korra had this Akward deep intimate tension between them, followed by an extremely uncomfortable holding of hands and going on a ""vacation"" together. I found this distasteful as Korra was with a guy from the beginning..and last minute the director makes her bisexual. Personally being a big fan of the series and having watched from The Last Airbender to this point I found it completely unnecessary, not only because this is a child show but also because that kind of lifestyle just doesn't go with this kind of TV show. It was never a part of the show from The Last Airbender all the way through korra book 3, but as all things hit with Hollywood magic and a little influence, things change. I would definitely recommend if you don't want a certain lifestyle to be around your child you should watch this ending before you buy it! This is probably one of the most distasteful endings if you are against a certain lifestyle, have certain religions, have certain beliefs, and just flat out have standards all together. My personal opinion is that, they should not have made korra weak and pathetic throughout the entirety of this book, as it destroys the strong heroine that was portrayed in the early goings. My advice is it just buy, the avatar last airbender Complete Edition, and then if you so choose, buy book 1 through book 3 and let it stop there. I can honestly not think of a more honest way to put this, then by simply saying book four is not for children, most adults would be uncomfortable with the ending around any kid they know. they destroyed the strong female character they tried to portray by making her the face of weakness and confusion. And make no mistake about it, infecting a children's show with this confused lifestyle to try to confuse them and influence them at early ages is definitely weak , pathetic, and the reason why so many people dislike same-gender individuals, you are not just trying to live your life peacefully you are actively trying to influence our children our, our lives, and our families. You are what you are but leave the children alone.",1434585600,14,2563,4.645374449339207

Rather, I'll briefly discuss the fourth book as a whole. Overall, as a final book to not only the LoK series, but most likely the last Avatar series book in general, I felt like this book was pretty weak compared to past books. One of my main concerns is that many of the characters we often see throughout the series, like Bumi and Tenzin, are pushed aside and hardly ever seen on screen. I understand that there's not always screen time for everyone, but the way the book played out left hardly any time for strong, supporting characters.
Compared to book 3, I also felt Kuvira was a pretty weak villain. She's good, and I like her, but again, for the finale book you want it to be big. I didn't feel it with her. The book just seems to drag in some cases, which is a shame. I liked book 4 alot, but compared to past LoK seasons, it probably falls last.",1429488000,,1013,4.336842105263158

6879581,5,B00QT4VDSO,"As a 25 year old woman, I grew up on the original ATLA and it took me a while to come to terms with a new avatar. Once I moved past the nostalgia and opened myself up to LOK I was hooked immediately.

I've read other reviews comparing the two and for me it comes down to a few simple things:
This is a DIFFERENT avatar. Just how I can appreciate Aang for always trying to remain peaceful and balanced, I can also appreciate Korra for her hotheadedness. Fact is she is in a world that does not need an avatar and its refreshing to see her character develop throughout the series. (Honestly I would love to see a 3rd series with Avatar Kyoshi which would be a completely different story arch too!) Seriously though, how many times do we want to see the same regurgitated story line where a character has it completely together, knows their purpose and how to accomplish it? This makes the difference with LOK and why I enjoy watching it.

Next, the supporting characters that make up Team Avatar are not master benders. There shouldn't even be an argument here. ATLA Katara was a master after book 1 and Toph is just a bamf from the very beginning. For LOK we aren't dealing with that at all. So sure we can't expect kick ass bending but again, its for taking it for what it is. I feel like LOK makes up with that some seriously awesome fighting sequences.

BOTTOM LINE: I love ATLA, the comic series and LOK. Fans who love the original, who can appreciative 2 different characters with 2 different journeys will love this show as well. It still is it the best animated programming I have ever come across.",1428969600,2,1604,4.393939393939394

6879588,4,B00QT4VDSO,"First, this book doesn't have 5 stars, because there's a lack of something in the bonuses. The featurettes are really average, not really interesting, as the audio comments (I've only listened the 5 first episodes for the moment).

That said, the show is just awesome, but sad in a way. We know that there will not be another seasons. Some people say that it's not as good as season 3. There are right, if you talk only about the the villain, or the complexity of the story. But if we talk about the journey of Korra, her solitude and her struggles against PTSD, lack of trust, and fear against who/what she is, this season is far above the others. And without love triangle...

Remember Prince Wu's words about the hero : ""He does great things only to pick up the girl"". And he's damn right. Many people talked about that, masking all the rest of the show before those 5 last seconds in the finale. I'm worried about that, because the show should not be restricted to that, it's more deep, important, heartbreaking and awesome, even if I was suprised and filled with joy when I discovered that the creators had the grit to show what I guessed since the beginning of the season.

One of the best animated show ever, and a perfect (well almost) conclusion for a saga.

Oh, by the way, the quality of the show in bluray is better that the one shown on TV/VOD. The image is sharper, precise, the sound deeper and so on.",1428537600,,1416,4.434615384615385

Personally, I thought Season 3 was the magnum opus of the Korra series, but 4 isn't too shabby. It touches on quite a few mature themes, and even re-introduces Toph into the series. (Review over, I'm sure that already convinced some of you to GO GET IT!)

Unfortunately, I found the villains to be less compelling this time around. Baatar Jr. will grate on your nerves, and Kuvira's persona is kind of bland compared to the charm and wit of Zaheer or the enigmatic Amon.

Don't really care much for Prince Wu, either, he seems like a bad replacement for Bolin's dynamic with Mako.

6879610,2,B00QT4VDSO,"I was a huge fan of the series.  Frankly, I was stunned at how much of a let down season 4 is.  Unlike seasons 1-3, season 4 has an incredibly unimaginative and weak antagonist.  While the writers seemed to be more focused on Korra's inner struggle rather than external forces, it's a shame that Kuvira is as flat as she is considering how brilliantly developed and interesting the past three villains are.  Even Zaheer's lackeys are more interesting  than Kuvira.  In fact, Zaheer is a more menacing and threatening presence in this season than Kuvira despite being imprisoned the whole time.  Also, the other characters have less interesting side stories in the past.  The only exception being Bo Lin, but even his story is not up to par with his role in previous seasons.  To be fair, there are a few bright spots.  The animation and music are just as good as expected.  Also, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, a certain character from the old series returns, which is by leaps and bounds the best part of this season.  I also don't care for the unexplained plot conveniences about the spirit world at the end, or the very last scene.  Most of the last episode felt forced rather than a natural resolution.  There was also a bit of an anti-climax with many of the original show's cast lives as adults having almost nothing to do with the plot, but that's more a personal preference than an objective critical remark.  Honestly, I would rather the show resolved at the end of season 3 rather than waste my time with this season.  Over all, I still like the series, but felt almost cheated by this being the big finale.",1427673600,7,1624,4.586805555555555

6879613,3,B00QT4VDSO,"""The Legend of Korra"" (TLOK), like its predecessor ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" (A:TLA), is a beautiful show.  That such thought, skill, and heart should be put into a kids' animated TV series is amazing -- though I suppose from the standpoint of statistics, with the sheer volume of kids' TV shows, such an excellent show was bound be made at some point.

The show is a joy to behold visually.  The backgrounds are often just gorgeous.  The animation is not as intricate or sophisticated as a feature film, but it is beyond any American animated TV and most Japanese TV anime I've seen.  The main characters are obviously drawn with love.  The martial arts choreography is fluid and realistic, based as it is on real martial arts like tai chi and various styles of kung fu.

The voice acting likewise is top notch.  One way this shows up is that the voices of the main characters are so natural; they don't sound cartoonish.  The actors use their natural voices (or close to).  This really stood out on A:TLA with its younger characters.  Instead of adult women mimicking children's voices, the young characters were voiced by kids and teens (of the same gender as the character).  The characters on TLOK are older, so it's perhaps not as great a stretch for the voice actors.  But young(ish) voice actors still voice the late-teen/early twenties characters, and older adult characters are voiced by older actors.  And of course they all do a great job -- skilled actors with skilled voice direction.  The exception to the rule is for minor characters who are often more cartoonish, often for humorous effect.

Frankly, I don't want to summarize the whole Avatar world or the entire A:TLA and TLOK story arcs.  Other commenters have done that.  But since this review is focused on Season (""Book"") 4, a few high points from this season are in order.  The major theme is Avatar Korra's long, lonely recovery from nearly being killed at the end of Season 2 by Zaheer and his gang, the Red Lotus.  Her healing is emotional (and, this being Avatar, spiritual) as much as physical.  Oh, and the big villain she has to defeat is a military dictator who takes over the Earth Kingdom and whose rule bears some resemblance to that of Hitler and the Nazis.  Pretty serious stuff for an animated kids TV show.

But, like A:TLA, TLOK treads carefully and lightly, mixing serious themes with slapstick humor and warm, funny relationships between the characters.  The action is kept from becoming too violent and deadly (kind of like how in the old Hulk comic books, nobody is injured or dies when the Hulk goes on a rampage through a city).  It rarely takes more than a moment to get over an injury.  About one death has occurred each season, and each time it's handled very discreetly, never graphically or gratuitously, typically occurring almost off-stage.

As just mentioned, the main characters typically share warm relationships, though there is definitely some drama.  This was especially the case in Seasons 1 and 2 with the Korra-Mako-Asami love triangle.  Season 3 saw the beginning of Bolin and Opal's relationship which continues here in Season 4.  Friends and family are ultimately faithful and true and kind.  Our heroes, though imperfect, submit to hardship, pain, and suffering to the point of death for friends, for family, and for the good of others.

And there's romance.  The first series, A:TLA, had several couples, Aang and Katara above all, and it saw these relationships develop over the entire series.  TLOK has more complicated drama, presumably because the characters are older:  Korra and Mako, Asami and Mako.  And Mako and Korra finally break up at the end of Season 2.  But there are other couples as well:  Bolin and Opal, Jinora and Kai, Varrick and Zhu Li (and I may have missed some).

I enjoy humor, action, and romance. I enjoy the high quality of the show and the serious, real-life issues it raises.  The courage and self-sacrifice are inspiring.  I'm a parent, and I want my kids to appreciate those things as well, and I have enjoyed sharing this show, especially with my 6th grade daughter.

So why only 3 stars?  Why not 5?  Because 3 is the average of 5 and 1.

** SPOILER ALERT **

The 1 comes entirely from the last few moments of the last episode of the series.  As you may have read in other reviews/comments, Korra and Asami walk off together into the sunset as it were -- in a lesbian reIationship.  I am deeply offended by this on moral grounds.  I do not bear homosexuals ill will, but I am morally opposed to homosexual behavior and therefore to its promotion, especially its promotion to children.

As always, the writing, acting, and animation in these last moments of the series are top notch, beautiful and sweet on the face of it.  Many fans love this ending.  Many love/defend it based on their moral approval of homosexuality.  That's their choice.  Many fans who love this ending also defend it as having been developed over a period of time, mostly in earlier episodes of Season 4 but even as far back as Seasons 2 and 3.  They even claim this shows artistic integrity on the part of the show's creators.

These latter defenses are simply wrong.  First, all of the other romantic relationships in both A:TLA and TLOK are heterosexual (of course).  There is no precedent in either series for a same-sex relationship.  The Korra-Asami relationship is inconsistent within the context of romantic relationships in the series.

Second, it is true that 20-20 hindsight does reveal a few very subtle hints of a developing romantic relationship between Korra and Asami (all in Season 4, in my opinion).  But they are so subtle that if you are not looking carefully for them, they are easily interpreted in light of a (non-sexual) friendship.  And they are most naturally interpreted this way.  This in fact demonstrates a lack of artistic integrity on the part of the creators.  All of the other romantic relationships in both A:TLA and TLOK are orders of magnitude more obvious in their development; they are telegraphed, not hidden.  The culmination of all of the other relationships therefore comes as a relief, not as a surprise.  So the manner of the development of the Korra-Asami relationship makes the show internally inconsistent, and this demonstrates the opposite of artistic integrity.

Of course, the same-sex relationship is externally inconsistent.  It is out of bounds.  Despite the protestations of some fans, this is still a kids' show.  It's on Nickelodeon for crying out loud.  Nickelodeon obviously required the show treat violence with kid gloves, and it obviously required the Korra-Asami relationship to be so subtle as to be deniable by the network.  And it is sprung on us at the very last moment.  This is the opposite of artistic integrity.

This show, like its predecessor A:TLA, is supposed to be safe for children.  It is safe for children until the last few moments.  A big part of the show's appeal is its kid- and family-friendly approach to serious topics.  But the show ends with betrayal of itself and of its fans.",1427500800,9,7093,4.799173553719008

1) weak villain: Kulvira just makes for a really bland and uninteresting villain. She speaks in this emotionless
monotone that I presume was meant to make her seem robotic and inhuman but it just makes her boring. For me
she did not present a strong enough threat 2) terrible ending: I'm not talking about the relationship between Korra and Assami,
I'm talking about the actual end to the story. It is weak and poorly crafted. I was hoping for an epic battle royale or
the stunning revelation like in the previous three seasons, but you get none of that. A real let-down 3) comic relief: they
introduced a Sokka like character in Prince Wu, but he is not funny in the least, in fact he is quite annoying. Check that,
very annoying.
It IS an installment in the Legend of Korra series, so it can't be THAT bad. The animation as usual is incredible, as is the music.
They bring back a character from the original Avatar: the Last Airbender series who is an absolute delight, sarcastic and as feisty
as ever in her old age. And the sub-plot where Korra attempts to recover from a form of post traumatic stress syndrome is kind of
interesting.

The final season of Legend of Korra is truly great. In a few words, it is a great example for the viewers of how far Korra has come in her journey. The character development that happens in this season is substantial and competes with Book 3's development. Although I do wish they expanded this to be 15-18 episodes instead of 13, I have no complaints. If you have issue with the ending, don't watch it. If you think it was rushed, go watch Book 3 again and you will notice some subtle interaction between two specific characters that you may not have noticed before.

This is truly a great series and Book 4 really capped it off in the right way. I highly recommend this. Far more suited for the adult viewer and young viewer alike. If you are raising children who like Legend of Korra and you want to encourage them to be who they are and grow and become the best they can be, tell them to be like Korra.

In 4 books she grows in power, wisdom and spirituality to finally reach a balanced state in herself and thus being able to bring it to the world.

The finale is amazing, honestly it's one of the best I've seen since it ends not like a typical closure but it leaves a sense of new beginnings for all the characters of the show, each has a time to shine on their own and bring the best of themselves. The whole final battle is a great team effort sequence, aligned with the core values of the show: Family, Tolerance, Compassion and Empathy.

At the end Korra is finally happy with herself and with her role as the Avatar, eager to learn and do more. And in case you missed the subtle cues of Book 3 (subtle because of the Y7 Rating) the final 2 minutes make it pretty clear as she lets herself open to a new relationship that it's a beautiful and a great analogy of the balance between the material / spirit world.

A great ending for a great series, a must watch for everyone.",1426464000,2,1355,4.305882352941176

But the best thing about BALANCE is Kuvira. She is the summation of very antagonist that Korra has encountered. ""NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU'D ONLY SURRENDERED!"" That's right. Amon, Unalaq, Zaheer, Kuvira: they only want one thing: your abject surrender. They want to change the world, whether you like it or not. They have no limits. They have no compassion.

6879649,3,B00QT4VDSO,"If your a fan of the original avatar series you should give this a try, if your already a watcher please keep reading.
Season one started off rocky for me. This show is fairly different from Avatar:The Last Airbender (A:LAB). I got the distinctive feeling that it was aimed at those whom had gown up watching avatar (or it's just generally geared twords an older audience), because, let's face it with the main and sub themes in Korra, it's not a kids show. But it got my attention and I continued to watch to see where it would go.
Season 2 and 3 had high and low moments. The action, story, characters, relationships and story for these season were ""all or nothing"" moments. Korra's an awesome character, but you can only bang your head against the same wall so many times before you literally need to walk around it, or climb over it. In all honestly the side characters (Mako, Bolin, Asami...) for this show are what make it great, and the animation.

Season four had by far the best story and character development.  This show touches a little on just about every topic or idea related to modern society that I can curently think of (politics, ethics, relationships, buisness, war, etc.), and I have to say the writers for this show really know how to incorporate those ideas into a kids show so that they don't just ""blare"" at you, but instead work well with the story.

I however was not a fan of the ending. I know, from what I've read, that many are divided on the ending because they either feel that ""yes, we knew that was coming"" or they wonder ""what the heck just happend!""
I fall into the later category.  I saw no signs (call me blind if you want, but Ive seen and read alot, and 99% of the time I can call a relationship (who's gonna be with whom) with out fail, but not in this case (Not by a long shot).).
I feel as though the writers simply felt the needed to ""crowd please"" with the ending, and this matter has put-off the show for many of the viewers. The end felt to out of place for the circumstances that led up to it.

Overall Legend of Korra is a great show. If your looking to continue it, or start something new I recomend it regardless of how it ended.
Is this show worth it to watch or continue,  I'd say yes if your already a watcher or a fan then you should finish it. :)",1425859200,6,2303,4.2949308755760365

For those weaned on the epic adventure of Avatar Aang, it is such a delight to re-immerse into this world. Nothing can compare to the 3 genius seasons of The Last Airbender; this is the best cartoon of all time. But once I got used to the differences of the Korra-world, I was really pleased.

6879654,2,B00QT4VDSO,"Watched the first season... Gotta say didn't really mind it too much I mean the characters came off a little strange to me but I thought hey their teenagers of course their not going to be like the awesome cast of the last show. So by the end of first season I feel the ending is a little off but not in such a way that I really disliked the show and of course Nickelodeon is seeing dollar signs and tells the guys working on the show to make three more seasons out of a project that was only supposed to be one... So what do these creators choose to do with most of their characters? Teenager Drama... I seriously feel like that's what I got was some BS teenager high school drama for three seasons. Different characters changing their relationships at drops of a hat because the guys who were creating three seasons wanted filler. And so then I come to the end of season 4 where they decide maybe Korra should be at college level by now and having her curious faze where she takes a dip in the waters of lesbianism... Don't get me wrong people I could care less if Korra was lesbian just like I could care less if Mako was gay. It just pisses me off that the creators of this show choose to take something like this and try to use it to say ""hey guys aren't we so creative and cutting edge? I mean just look at our show we are so hip that we are going to make the main character by the end of the show lesbian... isn't that really cool?"" No its not!!! This is a show that in its roots (Referring to Last Air Bender) was about the beauty of the different forms of martial arts and about deep issues ranging from the genocide of an entire people to how one person is split between his loyalty to his family and his nation or if he should follow his conscious and his morals... I am just disappointed with what these people did with such a rich universe and once again has shown me that more is not better... sometimes its better to just accept what you had and enjoy quality.",1425168000,18,1975,4.172774869109948

6879659,5,B00QT4VDSO,"After reading a couple of the reviews I've realized that most of the low rated comments all have something in common. They're either stuck in the past and prefer A: TLA or have an issue with the finale.
After seeing TLoK, I reached the same conclusion as many people. It's not A: TLA. It's its own show. Many people say it wasn't as good as the first, but if they were to take the time to see it as something new rather than compare it to something from the past, they might've realized that it's actually a very well made show. While I admit I had that same thought in my mind, I quickly grew to love this series. It's something different, with new locations and characters, but familiar faces and locations are thrown in here and there to satisfy those seeking nostalgia. It's beautifully drawn out and the story behind it is excellent. I felt that it had a certain pace to it and kept to it throughout the seasons. And the battles and bending have reached a new level, making new challenges for the avatar and her friends.
While I won't go too far into the controversy of the finale, I will say that it was something new to hit the younger tv audiance. Was it completely in your face/I'm trying to make a point? By no means. It was, in my opinion, elegantly and smoothly introduced. It is a topic that most children and young adults know about by now, and nothing that in this day in age would be considered as surprising or shocking (I don't feel those words accurately portray what I'm trying to get through, but I drew a blank and couldn't think of something better), but some people just hold on to their own beliefs which is completely fine. I applaud the creators for being bold and introducing something new to the entertainment industry and saying ""Hey. It's not an issue. It's life. Deal with it.""
All in all, it is an amazing show, as expected and I hope future projects are already on the way for the future of the franchise!",1423353600,11,1939,4.403899721448468

6879661,5,B00QT4VDSO,"Fantastic. My absolute favorite series of any on television, and a great conclusion. It leaves you wanting more, of course, but I am just thankful that I got as much as I did. The animation is stunning, the storyline is relatable to actual history, the romance is a beautiful, unexpected thing, and in the final minutes I was in tears over the musical score and that ending. And of course there is Korra, a perfectly flawed character who finally realizes and accepts who she is. Korra is a character who truly grows and matures as the series progresses, and being someone around her age she is incredibly relatable. She represents all the confusion and anxiety of young adulthood, with a twist of her Avatar-related duties. She is strong and a good role model, an example that times will be tough and yet there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel and people who care for you. This season overall is not as good as the third season, which is pretty tough to beat, but it is certainly a great ending to a wonderful series. I also, of course, loved the theme of ""When love is real, it finds a way,"" quoting back from Avatar Roku from the original series. Love is bound by no gender or ethnical background, and in the case of avatar it is not bound by bender or non-bender. Korra also taught me that love can bloom and it can also fade, because that is how it is in the real life, and yet the series showed two couples who broke up and yet continued to be friends and allies despite their previous romantic endeavors - Tenzin and Lin, and Mako and Korra, which I think is a wonderful thing. This series showed me how one falls in love with the soul of another, and not their gender, which I believe is beautiful, romantic, and hopeful. I also enjoyed the importance of the characters Bolin and Varrick, they really stole the show and I think everyone was perfectly fine with that as Bolin was nothing more than a comic relief in the first two seasons and Varrick was too much of an interesting character to let him go.

6879668,5,B00QT4VDSO,"I have been a fan of the Avatar series since the beginning, it was my childhood, and of course, when it ended I was quite heartbroken; I thought that there would be no other show that was as great as showcasing morals, loss, sacrifice, etc. other than Avatar: The Last Airbender. When The Legend of Korra was announced in 2012, my initial reaction was ""Meh, not going to be as good as The Last Airbender"". I was still quite bitter from when Aang's story ended. However, I found the time to watch The Legend of Korra, by the time that happened, the second season was finished. I loved it so much; first season really hooked me and pulled me in, second was great, but not as good as the first season. The third season is probably my favorite, maybe tied to the fourth season. I was ecstatic when the creators announced its premier on October 3rd.
The villains have much more depth and the creators put more thought into making them perhaps relate-able or to the point where we sort of pity them. Amon, Tarrlok, the Red Lotus and Kuvira had good ambitions: equality, connection and peace/tranquility amongst the spirits, end of corrupt governments and reverting back to natural order, and unity in chaos. But their ideals were fueled with a negative atmosphere and it led them to dangerous measures: taking bending away, fusing with Vaatu to bring in 10,000 years of darkness, reverting to an anarchist-like age, and a dictator making a totalitarian-like kingdom/empire. On the other hand, with Firelord Ozai, no one could sympathize with him at all, he was portrayed as just a selfish man who desired world domination; he had no empathy or sincerity or kindness. In my opinion, I honestly prefer the villains in The Legend of Korra, they were more complex and very ""human"", unlike Ozai who was an archetypal villain (not to say that he was not a bad character, he was an amazingly awesome villain, next to my all-time favorite Azula of course).
The Legend of Korra was originally going to be a mini-series and should have stopped at season one with Mako and Korra together as a couple (so glad it did not end there though). I enjoyed how in every season there was a new villain and it made a certain them or prospect prevalent that peace would never be achieved forever and that there would always be someone willing to ruin it for what they thing is for the good of others or the good of themselves. I get bored easily and one storyline for four seasons again in the Avatar world would not have rubbed off well on me. The show has exquisite character development, especially for Korra; each episode had a certain deepness and pensiveness, particularly in seasons maybe some of two and greatly in three and four. The show was a bit more serious than The Last Airbender, but it did have some of that old comedy in it too, not to Sokka's level though.
I really regret my quick decision on judging that Korra was never going to have as great a tale as Aang's; they were great in their own ways, but I preferred Korra's. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, just do not voice it so offensively like those of Makorra shippers and Korrasami shippers and people who are too doggedly stubborn to watch LoK. Many said it was revolutionary due to the ending, which everyone has most likely heard about already, but that was not the only thing that made it a great show; the soundtrack by Jeremy Zuckerberg, the story, the characters by artists like Joaquim Dos Santos, they were all started by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino, and created/animated by the staff of Studio Mir and Studio Reve.

SPOILER ALERT BELOW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

I was very, very, very pleased and happy with the ending; I literally cried tears of joy and sadness. Although, I was somewhat disappointed and upset with the ending, it just did not ""feel"" like one to me. Maybe that is just me wanting a book five or whatever. But I would have not liked LoK to end any other way because it ended on a good note. Hopefully, there is a continuation within a comic to record the events or the time after the battle with Kuvira's colossus and Asami's and Korra's date, I mean totally ""friendly"" and ""platonic"" adventure or outing into the Spirit World.",1422316800,8,4225,4.6021220159151195

2. Things change and yeah the world is different than when Aang was around. Deal with it. The show did some great things. My personal favorite was in Season 2 ""Can this ship outrun my crazy water bending ex-girlfriend?"" ""Why do you think I built it?"" Besides we got to find out how most of the main cast ended up. What else do you want?

3. The ""Ending"" (Spoiler Alert) Yes, Korra and Asami get together. They have been shipped together since Asami appeared. Heck, fans have been shipping Katara as a lesbian before the show aired (though originally with Yue). She used to be a guy. But even the fans were shocked and awed by them actually doing what most of us wanted. Check out the ""Reaction"" videos on youtube.
  If Asami had been a boy, would you even care? Seriously I heard no complaints when they and Mako were making out. Hand holding and true love gets complaints?
  I don't know why everyone expected either of them to pick Mako since they both dumped him at the end of Season 2. There were a few lesbian moments in the first season: Toph kissing Suki, Toph and Katara Mud Wrestling, Ty Lee and the Kyoshi warriors ""bonding"" in prison.

  Look there's a simple fact. Girls and boys will not turn gay because Korra and Asami are in a relationship. They will turn gay because they find the guys and girls on the show hot. It's like Ellen said in her sitcom when she came out.

Ex-Boyfriend: It wasn't me was it? I didn't turn you gay.
Ellen: Not unless you played Catwoman int he old Batman TV series.

6879675,4,B00QT4VDSO,"This final Book in the series it's not too bad, though it does leave you wanting more of just about everything.(Maybe they get answered in the upcoming comic or not, the creators aren't that finicky when it comes down to it.) If you're a fan and want a complete set or want to watch the final Book in your own pace then this is perfect for you and worth the buy. However, the ending being the blindside that it was turned several people off of the series and if you're one of them, I doubt you'll buy this but if you've bought the other 3 why not finish the set.

Personal thoughts from here on out. I enjoyed the Legend of Korra for what it is and that's a decent story. Major downfall of this series is the 12 to 13 episodes per season, fine if you're watching anime as that is the norm, but it gives a rushed and unpolished feel to the story which could have pushed the series into a more phenomenal light had they only increased the episode count.

Now from the view point of a writer, the ending was a surprise, not terrible or horrible like some others have mentioned. (Spoilers though nothing spelled out) The ending scene did feel as though it was out of place when you watch it as there are only 'hint' moments between the two characters during the end of Book 3 and parts of Book 4, as pointed out by Bryke and Michael. If you're familiar with anime the moments of blushing and subtle body moments, the creators took their p's and q's from the Japanese on this. Viewing Book 1 to Book 4 we could never really trust when a blush crossed the face of someone. As such I think that the Legend of Korra will be remembered for it's ending only, the journey is just as important as any ending but the focus from nearly everyone is only on the ending.

(Spoilers of the ending) This is not anti-bisexual but I don't really care that Korra and Asami got together at the end as a bisexual relationship is not something new or something that should be shocking. The suddenness and the lack of an actual solid story for the two is by far the worst thing to do when you're trying to ""break ground"". Animes and Mangas for years have touched on the relationships of bisexuals and lesbians, in such ways that show the growth and love between the characters, Bryke and Michael failed here. I feel as though the creators dropped the ball in writing, it's disappointing how they went on to say it was the viewers fault for not seeing the 'moments' they wrote that led to the couple getting together.",1421539200,19,2490,4.339055793991417
6879676,5,B00QT4VDSO,"After a rocky first and second season, ""The Legend of Korra"" finally finds its feet and goes out with a bang. Its third season remains the strongest, simply because it contained the perfect marriage of characterization and plotting, but there's plenty to enjoy here, in its final thirteen episodes.

As the spin-off and sequel to the beloved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender/dp/B000FZETI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, Korra has always been compared (often unfavourably) to its predecessor, when really it should have been judged on its own merits, or as an extension of the original series that (because of its older cast) could focus on more mature themes and interpersonal relationships.

In a steampunk(ish) fantasy world inspired by Asian history and mythology, certain individuals have the ability to manipulate (or ""bend"") one of the four elements: air, water, earth or fire. There exists only one person who can bend all the elements: the Avatar, an ancient reincarnated spirit tasked with keeping balance in the world. The current Avatar is a headstrong teenage girl called Korra, who was last seen at the end of season three in a grim state. After suffering mercury poisoning at the hands of that season's antagonist, Korra is sent to the Southern Water Tribe for healing.

Picking up three years later, we're reintroduced to the characters and their lives. The newly formed Air Nomads have been looking after communities in Korra's absence, while a charismatic general called Kuvira is steadily making her way around the countryside, coercing independent states to join her Earth Empire. Our key characters have been busy with new jobs: Mako is bodyguard to the feckless heir to the Earth Kingdom throne, Asami has designed a new infrastructure for Republic City, and Bolin is one of Kuvira's followers, distributing food and supplies to outlying townships in exchange for their subordination to Kuvira's growing rule.

But Korra herself has gone missing.

We find her travelling the Earth Kingdom incognito, a broken young woman struggling with the physical and mental toll that the events of last season had on her. Learning that Kuvira - who styles herself ""the Great Uniter"" - is forcing people to join her growing dictatorship should be enough for the Avatar to resume her duties, but first Korra has to work through her personal issues, with unexpected help from a familiar face from the original series.

It's not perfect. Because the main cast is divided over a wide geography, the cohesive ""teamwork"" aspect of the show is a little lost until the final few episodes, and because there are so many characters to juggle, a few of them fall through the cracks. But this, the fourth and final season, has several major strengths:

The first is the introduction of Kuvira as its antagonist, a ""villain"" who is allowed to have a sympathetic backstory, a clear point-of-view, and a real sense of integrity. Sometimes you can't help but agree with her decisions, admire her determination, and empathize with her pain. This leads to a confrontation between herself and Korra that's not simply resolved with fighting, but in an entirely unexpected way that demonstrates each woman's maturity.

The second is a stunningly accurate portrayal of post-traumatic stress disorder. Korra was left with bad emotional scars in the wake of the third season's finale, and these episodes detail the slow and arduous road to recovery. It takes its time, it doesn't stint on the physical and mental effects of depression, and Korra's healing process is all the more rewarding given the amount of time spent on her struggle to overcome it.

And last but certainly not least is the romantic pairing that the show choses to close with. I won't give it away (other reviews have already done so), but it's a beautiful depiction of a slow-burning attraction that is finally made canon in the last episode's closing seconds. Sorry nay-sayers, but I saw the growing love between these two characters: the glances, the gestures, the blushes, the subtext in their conversations - my only real surprise was that creators Michael Dante Di Martino and Bryan Konietzko were allowed to make it as explicit as they did.

Arguments against the couple usually boil down to it being ""out of left field"" or having ""no build-up"", even though the relationship grew over four seasons (particularly in the last two) and concludes with plans for a vacation, hand-holding and an intense look. That's it. Beside which, what we see here is not the *culmination* of a relationship, but the *beginning* of one, symbolized perfectly by the two participants standing together on the brink of another world.

But hey, if you've seen the show you've probably already made up your mind, which means I'm either preaching to the choir or arguing against a brick wall. All I can say is that I loved it.

In short, the animation is beautiful, the voice-acting is impeccable (Zelda Williams in particular blew me away as Kuvira) and the themes and storylines are more complex and mature than you'd expect from what is ostensibly a children's cartoon. Every main character gets their chance to shine, and all the major story-arcs are wrapped up satisfactorily.

After a shaky start, no one is happier than me that ""The Legend of Korra"" finally reached a point where it no longer stands in the shadow of its predecessor, but as an excellent piece of storytelling in its own right. I can't wait to see what Mike and Bryan do next.",1421107200,77,5580,5.111964873765094
6879677,5,B00QT4VDSO,Avatar: The Last Airbender and the Legend of Korra are probably 2 of the best animated shows ever.,1420761600,18,98,4.5
6879678,5,B00QT4VDSO,"The only legitimate complaint I've heard about The Legend of Korra is that it simply isn't The Last Airbender. Everything else is either completely made up or just a lame excuse to hate on it out of nostalgia for A:TLA. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion on the show, even if it's a wrong one.

Personally, I can't decide which show is the better one, The Legend of Korra or Avatar: The Last Airbender, but they are easily the best animated productions ever put to american television, and they've solidly staked their position in my top 5 favorite shows of all time. Yep, that good. There is simply nothing to dislike about the two shows: the characters are complex and easy to fall in love with, the stories are epic, intricate and compelling, the humor is consistently entertaining and appeals to people of any age, and even the dialogue is surprisingly mature and well-written considering it's viewed as a ""kid's"" show by many - and that's just to name a few of the wonders of this amazing franchise. However, the one advantage LoK has always had over TLA is that it has slightly better developed villains. They did a better job fleshing out the motivation of villains like Amon, Zaheer and Kuvira in the sequel series and focused a little more on what made them relatable, or even sympathetic characters, whereas Firelord Ozai in the original series (who was still an awesome villain) had more of the elements that made King Joffrey in Game of Thrones such a great villain (if you've seen that show you'll probably know what I mean).

Before going into detail on the final installment, let's recap the series. LoK started out with an engaging, well-written and all around spectacular first season, Book One: Air, and proceeded to get much better. The only exception was Book Two: Spirits. It was still phenomenally entertaining and wonderfully executed, but the slight drawback was the main story's focus on the spiritual themes. The whole spirit thing has always been more of a side-story in the Avatar franchise, and while making it the primary focus of that season was not without its perks (we got to see the origin of the Avatar cycle!) it just got a little tiring after 14 episodes. Still a damn good season, just not quite as impressive. The third season, Book Three: Change, proved to be the series' best yet, flawlessly balancing out storytelling, character development and comedy the way The Last Airbender did.

And now comes the final season, Book Four: Balance. All in all, I think it's tied with Book Three as the best of the series - not necessarily better, but certainly not worse. Putting its ranking among the other individual installments aside, there can be no doubt that it cements The Legend of Korra's status as a superior work of television. We see our main hero hit rock bottom and slowly regain herself throughout the season while fighting a power-hungry dictator, giving it a 'The Dark Knight Rises' kind of feel, and the epic finale concludes the series on a perfect note that mirrors the end of The Last Airbender.

MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD (and some pro-LGBT stuff): I, of course, am completely on board with the creator's decision to end the series by making Korra and Asami a couple. People complain about it being out of nowhere and random, but they obviously didn't watch the series very closely. Their relationship wasn't exactly one of the primary focuses of the series like Aang and Katara's in TLA, but there were several hints at their evolving friendship, particularly in the final two seasons. The very last scene illustrated it perfectly, because it showed them becoming a romantic pair in a silent and not-so-explicit sort of way, keeping consistent with the fact that their attraction to each other was never directly addressed (damn you, Nickelodeon!). But another thing I loved is how it depicted two women becoming a romantic couple as if it was a casual, everyday thing, which is how it should be in this day and age. I applaud the creators for doing this and revolutionizing children's television (for the record, though, I wouldn't consider this series or The Last Airbender to be a kid's show, but rather an adult/young adult show with certain content limitations which make it accessible to the younger crowd).

The other characters get satisfying send-offs as well, even though a lot of fans seem to be complaining because they weren't happy with what they got. Damn, there's just no pleasing some people.

All that said, I couldn't be happier with the finale. It's fitting, climactic, emotionally deep, and very uplifting. I'd go so far as to say that it, along with the A:TLA ending, is on par with the finale of Breaking Bad.

This series is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and this final season is a prime example. People should stop complaining and either accept the show for what it is or just stick to re-watching Avatar: The Last Airbender.",1420502400,105,4932,4.7952941176470585
6879679,5,B00QT4VDSO,"Amazing work of animation with an incredibly rich story that serves as a fantastic finale for the Legend of Korra series.  Avatar The Last Airbender fans may have been left unhappy since it didn't include any fan service for them in the finale (but Toph's appearance was certainly awesome), but LoK has always functioned as its own show independent from A:TLA.  The Fourth Book tackled incredibly complex political and psychological issues in an amazing fashion and provided political analogizes perhaps even better than Game of Thrones does. Kuvira's military takeover of the Earth Kingdom with the support of other world leaders who look the other way as she subjugates the people of the Earth Kingdom and commits ethnic cleansing is something most cartoon series for kids would never attempt to show.  Korra's journey to recover from PTSD is also incredibly compelling and well-done.  There isn't a simple fix that resolves her problems and she has to first address the physical, emotional and psychological issues before she can finally heal.  While the issues with the budget does show occasionally in the animation, the backgrounds and character animation are beautiful and very well-done.",1420502400,12,1195,5.2356020942408374

6879681,5,B00QT4VDSO,"This review is of the show and not the bluray since that's not released yet. Book 4 in particular, and the Legend of Korra, as a whole has some of the most outstanding sequences of animation. On par with many Japanese anime shows. Legend of Korra has a much more adult approach to story-telling, not shying away from difficult issues like murder-suicide (Amon and Tarlok), assassination of world leaders (The Earth Queen), PTSD, disability, political ideologies like socialism and anarchy, and finally totalitarianism and democracy. Korra's journey is long and complicated, and each book brings new villains and new challenges that she has to navigate through and eventually come to some kind of understanding.

I'm not really sure why some people feel the need to compare one series over another and one avatar over another. If there's anything both series have shown us is that each avatar has problems they had to deal with respective to their time and their era. Aang had to deal with a Fire Lord bent on world domination of one race over the other three. Once he was defeated, Aang's next major task is to restore balance, which manifested itself in the creation of the United Republic where people from all nations can live together harmoniously. Korra had to face antagonists who threatened to destroy that balance whether they be a group of anarchists who want to bring the world into chaos, a giant spirit who wants to bring 10000 years of darkness to the world, or a dictator who wanted to unify her kingdom by harnessing powerful spirit energy in the form of a giant mecha to achieve her goal.

Each avatar going all the way back to Avatar Wan had something to contribute to their society or problems that needed to be fixed/addressed. I don't find any one avatar eclipsing the others in terms of who did more. They all did their part in bringing or restoring balance to their world. That journey, no matter what form it takes is very much worth watching. I really do love and cherish the Legend of Korra as well as the Legend of Aang. Both series stand on its own.

I wholeheartedly followed the series through up until the end hoping that somehow korra would redeem and overcome all of her failures and intrispective character problems but was sad to realize she didn't (or perhaps couldnt?). Aside from the end twist which undoubtedly shocked viewers (and literally brought change) the story as a whole is just terrible and not even mediocre at best.  Why the creators did bring in awesome and exciting new ideas like Amon the psychic bloodbender, the red lotus, the ability of flight, and lavabending, all this does little to keep fans of the original series intrigued.  Korra will undoubtedly go down as the worst avatar in history (for losing the connection to all the past avatars just in and of itself is reason enough for such a title) but the animation was really good and i loved the score.
