3101973,5,B00134JVO8,"This is a really great video if you want to learn some basic Tahitian dancing.  I was looking for a video to learn the fa'arapu.  While this video does not teach that particular move I did learn a lot watching it.  There are 4 complete dances (two otea (the fast dance with the drums) and two aparima (the slower dance with singing))that you can learn, both the male and female parts.  Two of the dances are designed for children but anyone can dance them.  All the movements are explained really well and each part of the song is broken down into segments. Hand gestures are also broken down into segments as well as practice with the Ii (the hand tassles used in the otea).  I cannot recommend this video enough.  Also the company I bought this video from (using Amazon Marketplace) was really nice.  I got the video a week after I bought it.",1202947200,24,844,4.435064935064935

8249140,5,B00134JVO8,"Love Dvd, great instructions",1444867200,,28,6.25
8249141,4,B00134JVO8,"Instructed how to do basic foot and hand movements for this type of South Pacific dancing. Short practice segments are a draw back. Self motivation and determination to practice on my own, help me learn the dance movements shown on DVD better. Replaying disk and following the dancers is how to learn to do the dances performed on disk.",1431475200,,336,4.711864406779661

8249143,3,B00134JVO8,I was hopeful to have more Tahitian music and movements along with cultural tips.  Its OK.  Will pass it on to grandchildren.,1396224000,,125,4.636363636363637
8249144,3,B00134JVO8,Very disappointed .I had hoped to see dancing but this is a very slow laborious how to video.condition was ok.,1393372800,,110,4.55
8249145,3,B00134JVO8,"1) Not many basic steps covered. I didn't find the one I actually wanted to learn. Also there is no way to know which steps are included until you buy the DVD -  description is not very informative.
2) instructions on the footwork are not always clear. Instructor is facing you, not the mirror, which makes some things confusing.
3) dances are not broken down properly. They just demonstrate the dance without any explanations.",1382227200,5,427,4.77027027027027
8249146,5,B00134JVO8,"The material is presented in a joyful manner with increasing difficulty in execution of the several dances presented.  While remaining fun, it covers a lot of ground.  It is one of my favorites.",1343260800,8,194,4.848484848484849
