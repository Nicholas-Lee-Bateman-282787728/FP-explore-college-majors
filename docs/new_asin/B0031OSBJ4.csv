8387098,4,B0031OSBJ4,"This is a funny, guilty pleasure film which is great for a pick me up.
Full of great actors and a quirky spoof on common Latin superstitions - not meant to be taken seriously.",1334966400,,175,4.176470588235294
8387099,3,B0031OSBJ4,"Positive:
It's hard to describe this movie especially if the viewer's understanding of European settlement of the central and southern Americas is limited. A spanish matron settles into and develops a small Americas' fishing village and witnesses the interplay of  folk religion with Christian Catholicism; black with white culture; contemporary hedonistic morals with traditional principled morals; superstition whether it's magic or faith and the consequences of pursuing one vs. the other.

Negative:
The narration of the story comes largely from the youngest members of the village; the outside threats of violence; the sunset and birds symbolism and ending made the story a little too obtuse and difficult to follow.",1283040000,,721,5.605504587155964
