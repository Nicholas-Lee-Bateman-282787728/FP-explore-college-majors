7969185,3,B00006II7G,"It's not a bad video, per se, but the music isn't that fun, and I never could get into it. I still prefer the bellytwins work, or even Denise Austin's workouts. There is a warmup and a bit of a routine, so the structures's fine. The sets and the costumes are excellent, but the backup dancers/exercisers all move together nicely and are definitely getting some sort of workout, but it somehow lacks passion. They move very gracefully, but they all seem like clones somehow, and oddly enough, many of the background girls get more camera time than Rania. A lot may like this, but personally it didn't have the fun or playfulness of bellydance (or the energizing and/or sultry music) to move me.",1060387200,,693,4.642276422764228
7969186,4,B00006II7G,"1) Bellydance Boogie is a slow-tempoed, low-impact workout. However, like yoga, if you are conscientious about keeping good form, you'll be working your muscles. Boogie concentrates on the ""camel"", a torso undulation that will give you 6-pack abs if practiced regularly.
2) The choreography is no great work of art, but will give you the strengthening exercises you need to gracefully get through a real, live bellydance classes. She covers:
- upper and lower body undulations (camels)
- travelling with undulations
- snake arms
- horizontal and vertical figure 8s
- turns, which are easy to combine with spotting
- 4-cornered hip circle
- basic descent as a prelude to floorwork
At the end is a nicely-executed sword routine which incorporate the moves that are introduced, which you'll be able to analyze after you've done this tape.
Remember, tapes are no substitute for class. But they are a valuable tool for practice. Rania's tapes have so far been the easiest for me to introduce non-dancing gym buddies to belly dance moves in a way that's not too weird for their taste, and allows me to get the dance workout I need.",1050537600,9,1125,4.895287958115183
7969187,1,B00006II7G,"This video was not at all what I had hoped.  I didn't even break a sweat.  The movements did not flow together well and the music was anything but a boogie.  If you like pretty girls, snake arms and figure eights, then this is the video for you.  However, I'm afraid my copy of this video will be donated to the good will.",1050364800,,322,4.063492063492063
7969188,5,B00006II7G,"I am half Lebanese and have been bellydancing all my life. I am fully aware what great health benefits it has (I have 3 kids and it does not show). Also I am a big fan of Rania and of Veena and Neena (the same company produces their videos and I have all of them!). I think Rania's new videos are dynamite. She is responding to people who want to learn bellydance without having to hear Middle Eastern music, so all the workouts have different type of music. She is a real bellydancer and great teacher. I read some of the negative reviews and all I can think is that they are expecting the bellydance looking set and music, whereas this set is more high-tech. If you can just look at the quality of instruction and the moves and combinations, you will be very happy, she teaches a lot. You will be doing bellydance combinations by the end of the tape. You will learn alot and not realise you had a workout.",1041292800,5,907,4.27906976744186
7969189,5,B00006II7G,"I really enjoyed working out with Rania and think this video is terrific.  I have been doing it for two weeks now, the moves are great, and I have lost over ten pounds.  This video has changed my life.  I never thought an exercise video could be so much fun.  It took a couple of viewings to get the steps down, but now my workouts go by so quickly and it hardly seems like I am exercising.  The music is terrific and Rania is a great instructor.  I look forward to trying your other tapes, but in the meantime I will continue to enjoy this one.",1041292800,4,545,4.09433962264151
7969190,2,B00006II7G,"I purchased this video based on the fact that I saw her website and brought some music that she recommended.  I thought that with a Boogie title there would be some movements to get me sweating and music that would have me in love.
I was seriously disappointed.  Rania looked like she wanted to do her own talking but the voiceover was there.  And there there were the two blondes who seemed to get more camera time than Rania.  The movements were not really what I wanted to get me up and moving (I really hated the on bended knee with chicken neck movements).  Considering the type of music Rania recommends on her site I was shocked at the music selected for her dancing.  It was boring, slow, and really didn't seem Middle Eastern. I am glad that I got it on sale for 8.99.  I might buy the other two videos to complete the set that I have but I am not sure if I will buy anymore with her teaching unless I view it first.",1041206400,,925,4.192090395480226
7969191,3,B00006II7G,"After doing all the Neena and Veena tapes I was excited to see this new Rania series. The moves will take longer to learn if you've never done any bellydancing before (the Neena and Veena tapes are a good start), but no bellydance experience is needed. The production quality and music is good. I found the voice over helpful in doing the moves. The workout was fun; the 30 minutes passed by quickly. Rania does an interesting sword balancing dance at the end. The reason I didn't rank the video higher was because I think the title ""Fitness for Weight Loss"" is misleading. The workout is good, but slow paced. I'm a workout newbie and I didn't come close to breaking a sweat. By the title I thought it would be more cardio. This is more of a relaxing slowdance.",1037664000,7,762,4.45
