8602544,5,B00E8K2IKS,"Excellent film. A comical, meandering, and unlikely trip through the intertwined lives of a young underachiever and an frail (and forgotten) old man. A great feel good movie, especially for those looking to recall their past youth in working class Britain.",1483228800,,256,5.2682926829268295

8602549,5,B00E8K2IKS,"Kevin is one of those youths with a heart and conscience but no opportunities and so has fallen into a life of petty crime. He has even stolen from his single, mum sister and burnt most of his bridges. Then he gets offered a job for Nigel. All he has to do is deliver a package. Well when that goes pear shaped he is advised that he will have to burgle a house. His mates chose one where an old man lives and guess he has loads of cash hidden away etc.

So Kevin breaks in and is caught  red handed. What happens next is an unlikely but heart warming story of how the old curmudgeon, Philip, played brilliantly by Philip Davis and the young offender start a relationship. It also turns out that the Scouse Nigel is a martial arts expert and is known locally as a bit of a psycho and goes by the moniker of Ninja Nigel, his weapon of choice being nun chucks.

This is really funny, really warm, very original and an absolute joy. For an independent production it is of exceptional quality and absolutely everyone does a first rate job on the acting side. Theo Barlem-Biggs as Kevin is perfect as the muddled teen with a heart of gold trying to get out but fear and poverty making him risk squandering his breaks. This has been around for a while and I am so glad I finally got to see it, this deserves much more attention than it has so far received and I can not recommend highly enough  just excellent.",1386979200,4,1403,4.2434456928838955
