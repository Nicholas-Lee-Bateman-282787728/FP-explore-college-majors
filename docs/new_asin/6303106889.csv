560760,4,6303106889,"This is a very good toning video which specifically targets the arms and abs.  It begins with what the box calls a ""preworkout drill,"" which is basically a few minutes of instruction on how to keep your lower back grounded on the floor while performing the abs exercises; once you know how to do this, you can skip over this section.
The main part of the workout starts with a 5-minute warmup.  Oddly enough, the exercises seemed more targeted to warming up the lower body (eg, squats and lunges), but some basic upper body stretches are included as well.  Next comes 18 total minutes of arms work.  Karen begins by using the bench in either a standing or seated position, moves on to lying on the bench, and then finishes with additional seated exercises.  She works the arms from all angles and includes many twists on traditional arm moves.  I thought that the usually neglected triceps were worked particularly well, but there was little shoulder work.
Karen then sets her bench on an incline for 14 minutes of abs work.  Abdominals seem to be Karen's forte, as she works them completely, hitting each muscle group and putting unique spins on classic crunches.  Following the abs work, Karen ends with 3 minutes of back work lying flat on the floor.  The entire workout (minus the opening instruction) clocks in at about 40 minutes.
I don't have a bench, but I was able to easily substitute a chair and the floor, although this limited my range of motion slightly.  As always, Karen is a master instructor who performs the moves flawlessly and cues well, although I felt that the latter was not quite up to par with her more recent workouts (this video was released in 1991).  Similarly, the feel of the video is a bit dated, especially with the Muzak-type music played during the warmup and the occasionally voice-over instruction offered by an unknown person (ie, not Karen).  Overall, however, this is still a very good video that will thoroughly work your arms and abs in a short amount of time.",1082160000,10,2003,4.691428571428571
560761,5,6303106889,"After reading all the other reviews, I bought this workout and they all proved to be true!!  This is such an excellent ARMS and ABS workout!!  Karen is a great instructor and she works your ARMS AND ABS until fatigued!!  You will feel it the next day with eveything you do!!  I am already seeing visible results and I have only done this workout 4 times.  If you want to reshape your upper body, this is the best investment for it!!!",1043366400,18,433,4.296296296296297
560762,5,6303106889,"This is a fantastic tape. This workout really works your entire upper body. My back, arms and abls are all visibly tighter, and my posture has greatly improved. I'm very glad I found this tape. I have never gotten any results with my arms before. Ms. Voight takes each exercise slowly, so you get the full benefit of each movement. I've used tapes where they do everything too quickly for it to do any good.
By the way, you don't need a step if you can improvise with your equipment a little. I chose to buy an incline board instead and my workout room has a step.",989884800,34,564,4.280373831775701
560763,5,6303106889,"These two videos put together will definitely give you a good total body toning workout.  I really like Firm Abs and Arms, not just because it's a great workout for your arms, but because Karen Voight really goes into detail in explaining proper form for ab exercises.  And Lean Legs and Buns, although not technically an aerobic workout, will still get your heart rate up there, just from all those squats, lunges, etc.  The only problem I had with these videos is that I wasn't aware that you need to use a step or platform with them.  You can get away with doing the arm and ab work on the floor, although it will not give you the same range of motion as on the step.  But for the Leg and Buns video, a step or platform is definitely needed.  Definitely buy these videos, but make sure you have some kind of stable platform to step on!",983318400,58,838,4.305732484076433
560764,5,6303106889,"Lean Legs and Buns is a 45-minute lower body workout, which can be adapted to your own fitness level. You can start with just the top platform of a step or add risers according to your strength level. Ankle weights intensify the exercises in one targeted segment.

For most of the workout, you will be lifting your own body weight. The exercises focus on the muscles of the buttocks, calves and thighs. While you are stepping on and off the platform, you are firming and shaping the lower body muscles and developing muscular endurance.

Karen's personal coaching keeps you moving, even if your pace is slower than hers at first. I sometimes stop and just ""march"" on the step until I catch my breath and then I enjoy getting back into the routine with a new sense of energy. Your muscles need oxygen, and this video is working large muscles! The Jazzy soundtrack is easy to listen to and softens at the end for the stretching segment.

I find this video to be one of my favorites as it is colorful and fun. There isn't any fancy footwork. Each move is precise and controlled. The first segment is a warm up, then you will be moving on and off the step to increase your heart rate....believe me, you will feel the burn in your calves and buttocks, however it is not so intense as to cause you to stop working out for too long. I appreciate the fact that in this workout, Karen seems to alternate between the more intense exercises and the easy ones. In that way, you can keep up with her. You also get to use a high stool to lean on for a bit. Ok, it is for support, but you know what I mean. You could also use Karen's weighted bar.

The third segment is a floor workout and Karen uses the step for support. I found this section to almost be relaxing when you don't use the ankle weights, so do use ankle weights to really get a good leg workout. The last segment is a brief stretch. If you wanted to extend your workout to one hour, you could spend a few minutes working out your abdominal and then spend ten minutes stretching. Karen's ""Precision Training for Body and Mind"" book, has stretching from page 90-101. It is available here at Amazon. It also contains exercises and health information you will enjoy reading about.

560765,5,6303106889,"One of the best things about this video is that Ms. Voight knows how to get you to use correct form so that you don't hurt your back and so that you get the most out of the workout. After only a couple of weeks I could  feel that the ab work was paying off. After two months of doing this tape  three times a week, I'm starting to see some muscle definition, my posture  is greatly improved, and I'm now using heavier weights. Be patient, stay  with it, eat a sensible diet, combine it with an aerobic workout, and  you'll definitely see results.",958780800,15,546,4.211538461538462
560766,5,6303106889,I loved this video.  It was a little rough at first but after we got into shape it was wonderful.  We did this video in a rotation with aerobics and did it every other day and we saw results within 4 weeks.,948672000,34,206,3.880952380952381

7837642,5,6303106889,"This is an easy to do work out.  Karen is constantly talking to remind you of the right form to do an excercise.  The unfortunate part is it takes time away from the work out.  So I will add time doing an excersice while she talks about proper form, only a couple times in workout.  I also keep other weights close by to change them up more frequently than she does.  She does mention this in the work out.  She mixes going from one work out to another using the same weights.  Where I will change and grab a heavier or lighter weight to fit the exercise.  The abs work out is different as it is done on an inclined bench or step.  I try to do this work out after a hard areobic day or after a run.",1368230400,,698,3.964028776978417
7837643,3,6303106889,I have a lot of Karen Voight workouts and love her style.  And I only consider myself in the intermediate level of exercising.  But even doing both 40-minute workouts together barely raised a temporary sweat and I didn't feel like I was working any muscle groups in a way that would lead to results.  Karen's Great Weighted Workout is a much better overall workout that gives you results after about two weeks of consistent use.,1190419200,2,428,4.68
7837644,1,6303106889,"Her instruction may be very good but this was filmed in the early 1990's. I ordered this video under the impression it was filmed within the past few years (release date: 2002). However, the packaging of the video box was simply updated.  I also didn't realize that I would need a step or bench to complete the workout. Just know what you are ordering!",1104969600,4,352,4.5
