2073646,4,B0002B54VW,"""Wanted: Babysitter"" (1975  AKA: ""Scar Tissue"") is stylish, great French film director, Rene Clement who was approx. 83 years old when he died on March 17, 1996 his last film and he co-wrote it with Mark Peploe.  It was terribly reviewed and considered incomprehensible and was thought to have little future.  The film was produced by Carlo Ponti and stars Robert Vaughan, Vic Morrow, Maria Schneider (who died recently) and under-appreciated Sydney Rome.  With the stylish editing, a few scenes in flash forwards, make the film seem incomprehensible, but I think from the poorly dubbed version that Passion Productions used and their use of this shaky print is likely to be a major part of the problem than Clement's decisions.  The movie is enthralling and the plot this time out is better than 1971's ""The Deadly Trap"" with Faye Dunaway, Frank Langella and Barbara Parkins which was rather slight.  ""Wanted: Babysitter"" is Clement's best film I've seen since 1969's masterpiece, ""Rider on the Rain"" which has had its share of poor distributors and hasn't had a DVD release that holds up to its potential.  They are both complex stories, ""Rider"" a product of the great writer Sebastian Japrisot.  It was a joy to see these actors working and something new by Clement who began his film career with an Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film in 1952 with ""Forbidden Games"" and later also did the masterpiece ""Purple Noon"" in 1963 and later scored less successfully with 1965's ""Joy House"" also with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda.  Clement does a lot with the plot about a kidnapping, extortion, revenge and murder.  The extremely low cost of this DVD makes it a must for those wanting to see an American take on European art, an exciting story told by a consistently great director.  It is true, Clement never again repeated the brilliance of his beginning, but he is extremely gifted.  The music again is by the great Francis Lai.  All this talent is put to good use.",1317427200,4,1961,4.817910447761194

2073649,2,B0002B54VW,"A foreign production, poor lighting, bad sound effects, if not for Vic Morrow and Robert Vaughn, no one would have bothered to watch the movie.  The plot is simple.  A rich man's son is kidnapped and kept in a derelict house in the outskirts of town.  The only neighbor is a nosey old lady with her dog.  A babysitter was hired to take care of the child while the kidnappers try to elicit ransom from the boy's father.  Vic Morrow plays a stuntman, sent by the kidnappers to keep an eye on the babysitter and the kidnapped boy.  When they attempted to seek help from the nosey old lady, both she and dog got killed.  The kidnappers tried to outwit each other and keep the entire ransom.  Alas, evil never triumphs and all ended up dead (by their own devices).",1188000000,3,759,4.371428571428571

IMDb synopsis for WANTED: BABYSITTER--
""A naive young girl is forcefully kidnapped while babysitting the son of a wealthy food mogul. She and the boy are held hostage by an ex-stuntman and a vengeful movie star.""

.
Director Ren Clment's final picture is a most unusual one. Francis Lai's haunting score enhances the melancholy mood and slightly offsets a sinister cloud hanging over the story. Slow-paced at times, but rewarding. Has a bittersweet finale.

Schneider and Morrow are excellent. Recommended  for fans of Euro cinema.
