I just couldn't sit through another minute of stupidity, lame script and sincere desire for the power to go out. I give two stars only out of respect for the films that I give one star.",1470268800,,282,4.2407407407407405

8414810,3,B0043EWN3Q,This is a classic low budget B-movie but I liked it. The acting and script were decent and kept me interested. I would recommend watching this if you like classic B-movie zombie horror.,1330128000,,185,4.636363636363637
8414811,3,B0043EWN3Q,"This movie was made for die hard zombie fans...those of us who will sit through several minutes of almost any zombie movie with a special fx budget over $100. This was not a particularly good zombie movie. It wasn't the worst either. In a world where any director can get a cell phone and a couple 100 friends, towns folk and idiots together to wear ketchup and pancake batter and call it a zombie movie on Amazon VOD, this was a refreshing disappointment. The acting was C (as expected). The cinematography was sharp and crisp (surprisingly professional). The make-up/special fx were C+ but the story was definitely D- or worse. The typical mystery virus, living dead, need to escape movie turned into a poorly developed politically laden editorial on gun control and human beings are the most dangerous monsters. If you are like me; intelligent while being able to enjoy the most mundane and often poorly conceived zombie movies ever made, rent this one.....DO NOT BUY IT!",1307404800,3,974,4.838323353293413
8414812,2,B0043EWN3Q,"****Spoiler Alert****

This movie was interesting for a little while. Only in that it tracked the outbreak of a weird viral infection and the results on a small town. But it went in the direction of stupidity and incredible lack of logic...

1. They were fighting for a car, essentially, as if there were no available cars to be found. Fact of the matter is that if events had unfolded like the movie depicted, there would have been available automobiles everywhere. So the very thing that forced the 6 guys together was based on sheer ridiculous logic.

2. They had them find and use guns to stop the zombies from getting them. But in true Hollywood anti-gun tradition, everybody gets shot by each other and they all die... teaching us that no good can come from personal gun ownership.

3. The conflict between the characters was childish, unbelievable, unnecessary, and overall... just too contrived.

While there were a few good scenes and it was somewhat worth watching for those select parts, I couldn't help but feel that it was just another zombie movie that some writer/director came up with to push their agenda. Somebody wrote a beginning and an end that they wanted, then made up a bunch of nonsense to fill the spaces between. And they violated a lot of logic in the process.",1299628800,7,1288,4.706666666666667
8414813,4,B0043EWN3Q,"Six complete strangers are forced to band together and flee the city when a zombie outbreak occurs.  But after making camp in the middle of the wilderness, the group relaizes it's each other they should fear....

A movie with a lot of ambition, friends, adversity, talent, great make-up and special FX get the notice of Film Festivals and directors across the country.  It is noted as ""the Little Indie That Could"".

Fill your need for good horror and suspense.

And a surprise - look after the credits.",1288742400,,503,4.735632183908046
