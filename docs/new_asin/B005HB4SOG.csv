4699107,5,B005HB4SOG,"This is a great introduction to poetry for kids. They selected a good combination of diverse poems. The different voices of the readers, the graphics that are interesting but not overboard, and all the kids who are interviewed are all valuable. I think that a younger kid (4 or 5 years old), who cannot quite grasp the poetry part of this yet, will be intrigued to see these kids talking about poetry and how special it is to them. That will draw them in more than anything else here, and as they get older, hopefully they will come to appreciate the poetry itself.",1341964800,4,565,4.495145631067961
4699108,5,B005HB4SOG,"More than 5 stars worth.  Beyond delightful.  Creative, imaginative.  Great voices, wonderful selections to hear and see.  The kids are impressive in their grasp and ability to talk about poetry - the depth of understanding and the ability to articulate both the understanding and how poems make them feel...so good that I had to stop the dvd a few times to take it in.  The adult voices - actors and the poets themselves - and the voices of the kids mesh perfectly.  Am ordering a copy for a birthday gift for a 6 year old and would not object if someone gave me a copy for my birthday.  A half hour of pure delight.",1331683200,,617,4.359649122807017
4699109,4,B005HB4SOG,"This film was done with charm and grace, giving the kids a sweet window to poetry.. I personally prefer the earlier version of it (classical baby- I'm grown up now- the poetry show ) but my 2 (!!) year old enjoys both a lot.",1327708800,,224,4.113636363636363
4699110,5,B005HB4SOG,I LOVED this video. It is put together masterfully and with the great simplicity needed to do justice to both children and to poetry. The poems and the animation were wonderful but what really blew me away were the children who commented on the poems and on poetry in general. They are so wise and sensitive. It was an honor to hear and see them. You can go to the website (part of the HBO website) for this video and download a lovely booklet with most of the poems and some of the graphics. I hope to use this video with some older adults I teach from time to time. I know they will love it too.,1326499200,2,597,4.111111111111111
4699111,5,B005HB4SOG,"Reading poetry to my children is something I have been doing since they were babies and was so happy when I learned that their school is really into poetry and having kids display their work. When I heard that HBO Family and The Poetry Foundation collaborated to present A Child's Garden of Poetry, I was thrilled.

Like songs, poetry is something that really speak to people on an individual basis. There is a feeling you get when you hear a poem or a song which to me is really poetry to music.

This presentation takes some of the best poems and puts them to animations. My kids and I adored the visuals accompanied by voice overs of some amazing performers like Dave Mathews, Claire Danes, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Liam Neeson and others make this a great DVD for kids and adults. My children especially loved the clips of kids reciting their favorite poems and what the poems mean to them. As children do, they are candid and speak from the heart. Truly an adorable DVD.

My personal favorite was The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost read by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Loved it!

Children and adults will love watching the poems come to life!

Another great moment is all the children painting to a poem by E.E. Cummings.",1320883200,10,1220,4.577981651376147
4699112,5,B005HB4SOG,"Adore this video!  I found it to be very well done and inspiring.  My favourite things about the DVD.

The stars and authors were not actually in the production, they just read for it.  I like that...it's about the poetry, NOT the actors.

The children were engaging as were their thoughts and ideas regarding poetry!  I like that they weren't ""actor"" kids!

The art is amazing and makes each poem come to life.  I also like the words coming on screen so children can see the words not just hear them.

I like that the children interviewed were all ages and nationalities. One poem was signed for hearing impaired.

This video is sure to inspire all ages!!

I received this DVD (happily!) from the publisher to review, for my opinion (good or bad).",1320710400,8,748,4.548872180451128
4699113,5,B005HB4SOG,"KIWI Magazine Review:

HBO Family has produced some lovely shows for children, and this latest creation, A Child's Garden of Poetry, is no exception.

In a winning combination of interviews with children, famous narrators, lovely animation, and, of course, wonderful poetry by the likes of e.e. cummings and Robert Frost, HBO Family makes poetry accessible and enjoyable. Although targeted toward children, this DVD is pure joy to see and hear. Prepare to dream in iambic pentameter.",1320278400,3,483,5.342105263157895
4699114,5,B005HB4SOG,"I used this DVD with my third, fourth, and fifth grade students as supplemental/extension material last month.  They loved it.  In particular, they loved the comments made by the young people --- ""words are powerful"" etc.  Then I also used it with my third graders during snack and story time this week.  I read ""The Road Less Travelled"" and then they read it many times out loud, identifying with the narrator's quandry that there are good choices and best choices in life.  I also used it three years ago for an entire unit with my fourth graders.  Their standardized test scores were higher than usual as a class; they started the unit not liking poetry but ended up loving it.  Yesterday at a job interview I showed some samples of their poems inspired by this DVD.  I still feel proud.  We need more materials using classic texts that are interpreted by world-class actors as well as engaged students.  Thank you HBO, the Poetry Foundation, et al.",1443830400,,952,4.680722891566265

4699117,2,B005HB4SOG,"Not as good as other HBO products (the music show and poetry show).  Wish they would've spent more time just reading poetry, but has an odd segment of a classroom acting out Romeo and Juliet and another segment on children rapping.  Not the type of poetry I was hoping to expose my children to at this stage of their education.",1426204800,,327,4.433333333333334

4699122,5,B005HB4SOG,"This is in the family of the ""Classical Baby"" HBO produced videos, which I also love.  The production quality is quite good and I much prefer these to the low production value Einstein series.  I don't think watching toys is more developmental than listening to great poetry or music, or seeing works of art (the Classical Baby videos).  I highly recommend these - our 1yo has been watching these since he was probably 6 months old (yeah, I know it's not-advised before 1).  He LOVES them and I don't mind watching them either.  Beautiful poems, excellent narration, and calming animation to go along with it.

If someone asked me what single video they should buy for a 6-24 month old, this would definitely be my recommendation.",1387929600,3,730,4.753968253968254

I have twice used this DVD as a fun, yet insightful introduction to poetry-- what it looks like, sounds like and what purpose poetry serves.  It makes poetry, which many students believe is stuffy and only for the most literate among us, seem within reach, seem 'doable' and even enjoyable.",1378771200,,420,4.739726027397261
4699124,5,B005HB4SOG,I have been looking for this since I saw it on television in 2011 and I was so delighted with it I ordered one as a birthday present for a friend. Incredibly fast delivery too. Thanks!,1378339200,,184,4.138888888888889

4699128,5,B005HB4SOG,"We have the whole HBO for Kids DVD collection.  Our 2 year old daughter watches them before going to bed.  Baby Genius and Baby Einstein seem like amateur home videos in comparison.  The quality of these HBO DVDs is professional with original content and animation.
Also, the length of ~25 minutes is perfect.  Long enough for her to see before going to bed.  Other videos like Sesame Street run an hour.
Our only wish would have been a soundtrack in Spanish like the Good Night Moon DVD.
Highly, highly recommended!",1365206400,,516,4.688888888888889

Fans of The Poetry Show will recognize a few of the children and the same style in SOME of the animated segments. For those not familiar with The Poetry Show, both DVDs resemble music video compilations (mostly animated), but with authors reading or singing poems, and poems are alternated with children reciting poems and talking about what poetry is, their interpretations, etc. While another reviewer did not appreciate the inclusion of actual children discussing poetry, I happen to love that component because it seems to make poetry more interesting to my daughter.

While my daughter does enjoy this DVD, it isn't fitting for a bedtime routine due to some of the more visually jarring segments (think bright, graphic prints in motion) and a short piece that includes a teacher talking to her classroom in a tone that is not calming. In fact, this DVD engaged my daughter to the point that she was wound up after watching it twice the first night, and we had to switch to The Poetry Show to calm her down. I'm not sure how much airtime this DVD will get because I don't think my daughter will ever request it during the day, and I don't typically turn the tv on for background noise.

That being said, I still highly recommend this DVD for any parent who wants to make poetry come alive for their children, but the Poetry Show is the definite winner in our house.",1507420800,,1737,5.241007194244604
