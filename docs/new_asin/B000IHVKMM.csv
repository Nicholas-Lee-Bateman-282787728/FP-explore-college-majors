8145690,5,B000IHVKMM,"I've given ""Dominick Hide"" five stars because I can not give it ten stars. ""The Flipside of Dominick Hide"" began life as a B.B.C. television film in 1980 and then sank without a trace for 25 years.
It's one of the most delightful films ever and so to avoid an unforgivable spoiler, I'll discuss context and avoid content. The only clue I'll drop is that this film is a superb example of a thought experiment, a ""what if...."" in the best science fiction tradition.

Dominick Hide (Peter Firth) lives in post-apocalyptic London in the year 2130 and works as a ""Corro""(time traveller):  visiting/""fliping"" to London 1980 in his flying saucer. Dominick replaces data lost on the London transport system in the nuclear war of 1999. Driven by a urgent personal quest, Dominick breaks the cardinal rule of  NEVER to set his saucer dowm.

Dominick then finds the vitality of 1980 life more alien than Mars to us.  People of 2130 lack psychological depth. Twenty-second century conversation is reduced to an Orwellian newspeak baby-babble making ambiguous and critical thinking impossible. So bland is everyday speech that the ""archaic"" expressions Dominick picks up on the ""flipside"" almost betray him;
""of course(?)""repeats, Dominick's superior Caleb Line (Patrick Magee) irritated by the word's obscurity.
""Actually(!) I haven't heard that word since I was a child,"" repeats Great Aunt Mavis (Sylvia Coleridge)with delight.

Objects don't time travel so well: Dominick's ""London A to Z"" crumbles to dust on one ""double return"" and a rose instantly withers when Dominick's computer ""compat"" wife Ava (Pippa Guard) opens its time-sealed container. Ava's momentary delight at  a fragrance unlike any of her century, turns to alarm when she realises that the rose could only have been gathered during a landing.

Ava warns Dominick that ""breaking of the rules could spoil our style"" i.e. bring punishment by job demoted - AVA and Domonick are paired by occupation: she time travels as tour guide. She is nevertheless horrified by Dominick's obvious solution: ""reprograming""(divorce). ""No...in other ways I am content with you.""

Alaric (Trevor Ray) his saucer mechanic is definately not ""content"" with his  sequence of ""compat"" wives. He returns his most recent, Ida (Sylvia Brayshay),  because she ""drinks tea in the morning, and paints her toes.""
  Ava: ""Her toes?""
  Aleric (expands): ""Red! The nails,red!"" - the color itself seeming to compound her deviance.
  Ava (in utter mystification): ""The computer must be at fault!""

Conformity has become a kind of faith in 2130 where the most trivial deviation is intollerable to the post-apolcayptical mind. Ida's deviance of toe-nail painting seems the first step on the way to another nuclear war.

2130 makes a tautology of contentment and complacency. Caleb Lane seeks assurance after a delayed double return by Dominick by asking if he is, ""complacent"" with his most recent ""flip"". When Domonick explains his tardiness by saying he wanted to observe the response to a traffic accident, Caleb hints at imoverishment of human spirit by sternly telling him to ""watch old films, if he wants to study people.""

Some precepts in the year 2130, that seemed merely amusing in 1980, set alarm bells ringing well before 2007.
""You don't use those do you? They destroy your body!"" warns Dominick,  as Jim Bone (Timothy Davies) Felix (Denis Lawson) and Midge (Bernadette Shortt) light up cigarettes.
""Don't, you'll destroy the atmosphere!"" cries Dominick snatching a flurocarbon pressure-pak from Jane's (Caroline Langrishe) hand.
Jane is amused by Dominick's 22nd. Century alarm, but she is alarmed herself, by another ""futuristic"" attitude when Dominick walks in on her in the bathtub and nonchalantly sits down with a glass of wine to keep her company.

Casual nudity is accepted in 2130, but intimate relations are literally sterile, activity must be proceeded by bathing and is subject to prudery. When Dominick shows Ava how people kiss in the 20th. Century, ""Soo"" (voice-Ysanne Churchman)the household computer, is shocked into dulling the household lights.

""Soo"" controls all aspects of the houshold; when we first meet Ava she is watching a holo-gram of musicians in mediaeval clothing playing an old folk tune on period instruments; The Beatles ""Yesterday.""
Dominick casually walks through the holo-gram several times as a wonderful set-up for the guitarist (Mitchell Dalton) in the ""Flipside"" restaurant. The narrative constantly interrupts Dominick's departure to build up tension - we know that our hapless time - traveller will mistake the real person for a holo-gram. Of course we are delighted when Dominick finally knocks the understandably infuriated musician off his stool!

Alaric warns Dominick of the dire consequences of mistakes on the flipside.

""A Corro landed in Ohio, U.S. in the 1950s and accidently killed a dog. The dog was supposed to warn the occupants their apartment building was on fire - it wasn't there and so eveybody died...including an architect who's buildings all fell down because he wasn't there to build them.
""You've heard of the Missing Persons' Bureau? People disappeared all down the line all because of a missing dog. When the Corro realized what he'd done he went ""dupe"" and died in an asylum.....""

Dominick was to do more than kill a dog to change history! My only complaint about ""Flipside"" is the flat studio lighting; unavoidable for television production.

As for ""Another Flip"" ~ SCHMALTZ! ~ leave good enough alone.",1171238400,4,5507,5.207248018120045
