2581707,1,B000FP2T0Y,"First and foremost, anything from ""SalsaCrazy Presents:"" is GARBAGE...their work out videos are bootleg looking. All the good reviews written about this workout or any of their workouts are written by people who work for the company or something... I've finally Figured it out!

Save yourself some money and leave SALSACRAZY alone... I mean if you value your money but most of all your common sense.!!!!",1175990400,7,403,5.106060606060606
2581708,5,B000FP2T0Y,"I got this DVD yesterday for Christmas and I popped it in the player today. To my surprise, I ended up going through entire the DVD from start to finish because it was so much fun.  I LOVED it.

If you aren't particularly interested in salsa dancing and are just looking for a good workout, I'm not sure this is the best DVD for you.  It certainly works your legs and hips, but doesn't do much with your upper body.  But if you love dancing and want to be able to practice salsa while getting your heart rate up, this workout could be perfect.

I used to be an intermediate salsa dancer, but after a break of five or so years, I now have to re-learn things I used to know.  I bought SalsaCrazy's ""Learn to Salsa Dance"" DVDs for Beginners, and they are quite good--but as you might expect, *those* DVDs are mainly for learning new steps.  The Salsa Dance Workout actually gives you practice time using steps in combination, and the pace lets you work up a sweat.  I'm going to use the Workout to solidify my footwork and enhance my dancing all while revving my heart.  And I can do the Workout without a partner.  (You can do the ""Learn to Salsa"" series solo, but you won't get as much out of it.)

Half or two-thirds of the DVD's playing time is devoted to learning the steps, but once you have those, you can go through the mini-workouts, each around 6 minutes long.  There are one or two beginner workouts, three or four intermediate ones, and a bonus intermediate/advanced one.  If you put them all together, you get a nice set that doesn't take up too much of your day.  (And two hours later, my thighs are feeling it!)

I hope SalsaCrazy puts out an Intermediate/Advanced Workout with even longer (or more) mini-workouts sometime--I'd happily buy it.",1167091200,20,1755,4.440625

2581710,5,B000FP2T0Y,"This is the second Salsa workout dvd I have purchased. I think this will be a better practice in Latin steps that are actually used in clubs. THe instructors are easy to follow, and the music is in standard form, no weird drums and strange beats.

2581711,1,B000FP2T0Y,"This was not what I expected.  This was not so much a fitness dvd as it was a dance lesson dvd.  And it was not encouraging to show what I learned on how to Salsa and then get told that is not the right way to Salsa.

Very disappointing, I wanted a Salsa workout dvd, was willing to settle for this even though it was not that good of a ""workout"", because I was going to learn to Salsa, and then to discover it was not teaching me to Salsa properly.

Returned item for full or partial refund.

Do not recommend.",1155600000,11,511,4.01980198019802

The instructor counts all the steps so you repeatedly hear throughout the entire thing 1234 5678 1234 5678. Its irritating and unnecessary! Even in the advanced section of the DVD. The music is also not that good and the instructor is pretty boring!

I hated it, and even looked into returning it for my money back since it was 46$!!US but i just decided to cut my loses.

I do not recommend this DVD, i am Cuban i know how to Salsa but i thought i could learn new moves and it was just too irritating to even watch because of the constant counting.

2581713,5,B000FP2T0Y,"Lazy people, rhythmless folks, men and women afflicted with both: your excuses are gone. Salsa Crazy has created Salsa Workout and now there's no reason why you can't take up a new hobby and get in your FDA recommended 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week.

Salsa workout is ridiculously simple to follow. You'll start off with a the basic Salsa step, learn a half dozen other moves or so then you're ready for the first workout on the DVD. Yes, I did say first.

The DVD is actually sectioned into 3 main workouts--1 for beginners, 1 for intermediate dancers / fitness levels, and 1 for all you do-it-all dancers out there. The intermediate workout, like the beginner's workout, is prefaced with instruction but you'll learn even more dance moves and hence, the workout will be even more spirited. As for the advance workout, well they'll teach you a routine with some cool moves then they'll say ""go"" and you'll start dancing, keeping up with the moves the teacher calls out while you're going.

This workout DVD, when you do the workout and not just the lesson, will definitely get your heart rate up and your blood pumping so it's a good medium-impact workout.",1151539200,6,1165,4.673170731707317
2581714,5,B000FP2T0Y,"I like to use this DVD as test. I'm new to Salsa dancing and have been using the Learn to Salsa Dance videos by Salsa Crazy (same folks who put this out). When I use this DVD I usually skip the sections where they're teaching dance moves (I know most but there are some new moves that I didn't learn on the other DVD) and go straight through to the beginner's workout. It's a test because if I can keep up then I know that I'm getting better in my overall Salsa dancing skills and following direction. On a good day, I will also do the intermediate workout on the tape. The advanced workout, I'm not quite ready for that but soon I will be, I'm sure. The DVD is a good workout because Salsa dancing is naturally a good cardiovascular workout.",1150934400,7,742,4.232394366197183
2581715,5,B000FP2T0Y,"Low-Impact & Fun?! Now There's No Reason To Not Exercise.

This appropriately named dance workout is an innovative and fun way to get that recommended 20-30 minutes of cardio in a couple times each week. From the title, you can discern that it's not your typical workout and once you begin the lesson, that notion will be confirmed.

While most workout DVDs begin with a warm-up, Salsa Dance Workout begins with a dance lesson. For the beginners' workout, the instructors demonstrate five different dance moves. They include: the Basic step and Side Basic step, the Double Forward & Double Back Break, the Cumbia Step, and Shoulder Shakes. The instructor takes care to give implicit directions on how to do each of the movements then proceeds with multiple counts of eight, both with and without music, so that the movement can be practiced. If you find that the beginners' workout is too elementary for you, then fast-forward to the intermediate workout. The challenge-factor definitely goes up, way up.

The intermediate workout follows the same format as the beginners' in that the instructor will teach the dance moves then take you through a run through with music but the difference is there's a whole lot more dance moves that are taught (3 times as many) and that run through with the dances back-to-back, well that's a whole lot more to handle. It's all in good fun though. And guess what. There's more good fun to be had because after the intermediate workout, there's also an advanced workout. Forget about instruction and explanation of moves on that one. The name of the game for the advanced workout is ""catch the beat and be ready to go right into the dance move that's called out"".

It's inevitable that users will learn the dances demonstrated and the initial workouts shown but boredom is a lot farther away with this DVD than other workout videos because the intermediate and advanced workouts have multiple variations of the work out; So in a sense, there are 7 different workouts on included on the DVD...Actually, eight if you include the bonus workout that's accessible from the menu. Other nice features of the DVD are the fact that the workouts are separate choices on the menu so you can decide which workout you'd like to do each day and that despite the fact that the DVD doesn't begin with a warm-up there is an optional warm-up provided for those who'd like to stretch before they dance.

All in all, Salsa Workout is a great, innovative, and fun workout. It's offers a low impact means for people of most ages and fitness levels to get some exercise and learn a thing or two about Salsa.",1150416000,15,2618,4.757709251101321
2581716,5,B000FP2T0Y,"I like to Salsa and I hate to exercise. This is the DVD that got me off my steadily growing tail and started doing regular exercise. It's a fun, invigorating but not too intense workout. I like this over other exercise DVDs because you're working your body physically like you would doing other exercises but the way you're doing it it's kind of like you're tricking yourself into exercising.

2581721,3,B000FP2T0Y,"I think this is good for slightly-above-beginners, maybe.  I agree with another reviewer that the way they show you the dance moves is actually a bit confusing (and I used to be in varsity dance many years ago).  Overall I felt that this was less effective and harder than it needed to be for some people out there because of (1) the instructors not mirroring you, and (2) the extremely loose clothes they're wearing making it difficult to see some of the moves properly.  The pace was fine for me as someone with a bit of dance experience, and I'm always looking for some way to exercise that isn't boring, so I do think I'll use it...but I wasn't overly impressed with it overall and probably won't buy another SalsaCrazy dvd after this unless it is cheaper.

While I was able to purchase this product at a slightly reduced price for reviewing purposes, please know that I am not asked to write anything but my true opinion, I am not affiliated with the company in any way, and I'm never compensated for reviews.

2581734,4,B000FP2T0Y,"I received a review copy of the Salsa Dance Workout. I love dance aerobic workouts that actually use dance movements. It is a subjective distinction as most movements can be dance movements. However, there is a difference between dance aerobics intended for exercise and dance intended for socializing or creative expression. Occasionally, there are dance workouts that make a good compromise between exercise and dance as an art form (or social activity). The Salsa Dance Workout by Salsa Crazy is one of those dance workouts!

Difficulty Level: Beginner and intermediate to Salsa Dance
Runtime: 120 minutes divided into sections including  Stretching and isolations (19 minutes) Breakdown/instruction: (30 minutes), Intermediate workout with music (30 minutes),  and a 7 minute bonus workout
Purpose: Aerobic exercise, Salsa dance practice and fun
Music: upbeat salsa music, it has a kind of vintage feel to my ear kind of like Big Band with a Latin flair like you might hear in the background of some Latin cuisine restaurants.
Equipment Used: none, maybe some dance shoes (not trainers as they might stick to the floor while dancing especially during pivots and turns).
Menus and Chapters: Well chaptered with instructional and continuous workout sections
Impact Level:  low impact
Setting: brightly lit dance studio environment, the instructors movements are visible

What I Like About This Workout:

I like that it uses actual Salsa dance movements and Salsa music! I would rate the intensity as low-to-moderate aerobic (likely the infamous fat burning zone on a heart rate monitor). I feel it is similar to a brisk walk or a walking workout video (i.e. Leslie Sansone).

The instruction is separate from the workout. This is my ideal for dance workouts and sadly not enough DVD producers do this. To use pure dance moves some instruction is generally needed. However, once you learn the movements it gets tedious to hear the break down over and over and it also slows down the workout. My ideal dance cardio workout would include a separate instructional section, then chapters where you just do the workout to music with minimal cues. This meets my criteriathe actual workout (beginner and intermediate) has minimal cuesjust the move called out and counting. I have mixed feelings about the counting as I would love to just listen to the music, but think it would be valuable to a lot of users especially those who believe themselves to be rhythm challenged or who are taking salsa dance lessons.

I think this DVD would be a good practice companion for people who enjoy Salsa dancing or who are learning. I should mention that both the instructors do the lead (or mens) version of the footwork. However a female or follow could just mirror the steps. I will let you in on a secret, I naturally mirror a DVD instructor anyway as my brain isn't as good at processing the information to use the same side (unless they clearly mirror cue).  Experienced dancers could also embellish on top of the routine. I am a beginner with Salsa, but I do tend to add some flowing arm movements for the workout just to up the intensity a little. I likely would not do those movements partner dancing.
This Workout DVD Might Not Be For You If:

 You may be disappointed if you want a vigorous or intense aerobic workout. Intensity is subjective and varies by the person, but I find it similar in intensity to a walk, an evening dancing socially or a walking workout DVD.

The production quality isn't the highest that I have seen. However, I can forgive that since the DVD is well chaptered and organized, the instruction clear and the movements visible. I also eventually found it a little monotonous to hear the instructor count throughout the workout. I have mixed feelings on this because I do feel it is a very useful instruction for people unfamiliar with the music or who feel rhythm challenged. But sometimes I just wanted to dance and hear the music. All in all, I feel this is a very solid light aerobic dance workout and practice aid.",1425600000,,4035,4.883040935672515
2581735,5,B000FP2T0Y,"If you love to dance and move around, you'll love this! Whether you want just a fun workout or to actually pick up some Salsa moves, this is a great workout. SalsaCrazy has used the same guy from the Learn to Salsa DVDs and he is FULL of enthusiasm. I love the fact that this guy is so jazzed about doing Salsa and teaching you how to do it.

The workout is different from the learning ones because they go fast, but you get different views. When you do the learning one, you'll get several footwork areas, this time around you get a backside view - both are helpful, but I think the backside helps get a feel for how the entire body moves with the movements, or at the very least, how it should more.

The pace is good, I mean, it is salsa dancing after all. The guy is FULL of energy and very encouraging. The people are real, they almost take missteps, and keep on going. I think your level of dancing skill will definitely bias how you feel about the video. If you've been salsa dancing for years, you might not appreciate some of the more basic steps, but this is just a high energy workout - not a learn to dance (something SalsaCrazy does offer), so don't expect that.

If you like dancing and want a fun workout, check it out. I liked it!",1425513600,,1246,4.205020920502092

2581745,4,B000FP2T0Y,"While the other DanceCrazy DVDs that I have tried out were strictly learn-to-dance for beginners, this workout is suppose to be a full-blown workout that is suppose to help you lose weight and get fit. Similar to other the dancing workouts, there is only one male and one female instructors that shows you step-by-step how to do each move. The workout features music from Benny Velarde y SuperCombo and Anthony Blea y su Charanga.

The Salsa Dance Workout is split into different sections with a 19 minute Stretching and Isolation warmup, Beginners Footwork: Salsa Basics (20 mins), Intermediate Footwork: Breakdown (30 mins), Intermediate Workout with Music (30 minutes) and a 7 minute bonus workout.

I wouldn't ever call this a fat burning workout as all the moves are pretty much slow moving ones. It is basically just a standard learn-to-dance workout, though the last 30-minute Intermediate Workout is has a faster pace. Instead of a high-impact workout that does hazards to your knees, this workout is a more of a low-impact one. Overall, the Salsa Dance Workout isn't a sweat pouring workout, but if your goal is to learn how to dance, then you just might like this DVD. I have two left feet, so I appreciated the slow moves as they were easier for me to pick up.

2581747,5,B000FP2T0Y,"This DVD is well done as a work out video for beginning Salsa students.
It is done progressively from teaching the basic steps, first slowly, and then at pace.  It also shows two different angles so you can learn from the position you are in as you are facing the TV. The instructor uses more than one method of helping you to get the rhythm, counting, and calling out the pace, Quick, quick, slow.  These teaching techniques are popular in all dance classes.
This DVD is a beginner DVD and is not for advanced students who already have knowledge and Salsa training.  It will help the beginner to pick up the basic step and learn intermediate steps which are put into several patterns that are used for a workout session. The hip motion that the girl demonstrates in the video is very good and if you follow her lead you will get a good hip and thigh work out.
Each step is explained clearly and effectively so that even the newest of students to Salsa should be able to pick it up!  Don't be discouraged, each step is repeated a few times and then is brought up to the speed of the music so you can catch on quickly.  Steps are taught in sequences so you then have a routine that is done to music!  A fun way to learn dance moves, and workout at the same time!  Soon, you will just be doing the routines and not the step reviews.  You do not have to go back and learn the steps each time, you can skip through right to the routines and head directly to the workout!  You are what makes this workout as fun as you want it to be.

When I saw the Salsa Dance Workout DVD, I was super excited. I have tried other Salsa Crazy products and have really enjoyed learning how to dance.

When I put in the DVD, I was expecting to get into a fun workout that would make me exercise hard. However, I got a ""workout"" that was basically Salsa dance instruction. I was really disappointed because I wanted to get a workout and not practice footwork to some really cheesy music. There are parts of the DVD that do have you dance for several minutes, but you aren't going to lose weight using this DVD.

This DVD was a major let down. The music was not appealing and the dance instructor was annoying. They did show some of the steps by another camera, but I just didn't like the way the whole DVD was set up.  I couldn't wait to get the ""workout"" over.  This is not a workout; this is dance lesson instruction. If you want to learn how to dance, then get their Ballroom Mastery (or another type of dance) set.

Bottom line: I would not buy this product for a workout. And, I would never go to it for a workout because I would go to my other workout DVDS that are designed to get me moving and burning calories. I guess you could get it to learn how to dance I am sad to say that I really didn't like this at all. I really think the company needs to update the contents!

What I got instead was basically a dance instruction video, which is good if you just want to learn some basic moves, but not so much if you are really wanting to burn some calories. Unfortunately most of the moves have you barely moving. My heart rate did not change at all. Furthermore, the filming just really is sub par, it appears dated, and the guy that is talking can get a bit annoying. Of all the salsa music that could have been used, this was definitely my least favorite music. That being said, I was able to get through the video without stopping and looking at the elapsed time, so at least the time flew by. If you are looking to learn some basic salsa moves, this is a great video. If you are wanting to burn calories and lose weight, this video is probably not for you.",1421452800,,1138,4.322429906542056
2581753,5,B000FP2T0Y,"I received the  dance workout DVD for reviewing purposes. Well this dvd is packed with lots of salsa steps, I danced salsa in school and I'm of spanish decent so I kind of thought I was going to know every step but I was wrong. The back step, the band step those were tricky moves but with practice I know I can master it. The instructors are very detailed and helpful. At first the woman in the clip was swinging her arms too much while dancing which made her look a little quirky but in the end she had finesse and grace. I really liked this Salsa DVD and its a great way to hear good salsa music and have fun while learning.",1421107200,,627,4.097560975609756

2581761,1,B000FP2T0Y,if you want to learn basic salsa steps this is great. if you want something exciting and fun to do this is not your video at all. it is boring and lacks excitement. i do not feel that i had any sort of workout afterwards.,1265846400,2,221,3.933333333333333
2581762,3,B000FP2T0Y,"The production value is fine, sound is clear, lighting is bright, filmed in a large room. I'd say moderate/good production, not top notch, but not low budget by any means. A couple potted plants against the blank wall behind Evan & Shannon.
Shannon never speaks. Evan has a corny sense of humor, tries maybe too hard to be positive/encouraging or to keep it light/fun, but it's much better then monotone any day. He does try to keep things moving so you don't get bored & I do like the pace in which he teaches. The bad thing is they rarely show a side view & he cues HIS left/right which is very hard. There's no mirror. The other thing someone mentioned was that they only teach starting with the left foot fwd which is the guy's start. If they go in 1 direction, they don't go in the other, such as the diamond step. They never teach to even flick your foot fwd before stepping back.
The music isn't ballroom boring, it's got a fast beat, but still is big band older style rather then modern club style Latin music like Zumba workout dvds. It's ok at first, but after a while it gets annoying in my personal opinion.
I never saw them dance together to see their dance ability until after the credits where he pretends to be caught doing a homage to the end of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" saying, ""You're still here? The workout is over!"" At first I thought they were not dancing fluidly to make it easy for beginner to see, but they really do dance a bit stiffly, they shuffle more then step lively, w/o passion & w/o true control.
He teaches slowly at first then normal speed without music, then a few more times with music. After learning all the moves in the basics, you get a 5 min practice of all those steps.

Bonus practice/workout for about 10 min

Previews of their other dvds: didn't even have actual footage of any, just the same guy saying how much you'll learn & how fun it will be.

I would say this can qualify as a dance workout as you get more practice then most dance instruction dvds that barely give you time to practice twice before moving on. They don't ask you to step as fast as you're suppose to since Latin music moves VERY fast, probably because you are a beginner. I definitely get a better workout with my regular dance workout dvds. I did learn some new moves though with turns, they went left, I went right because he taught from his perspective. And there are a lot of more boring paced & taught dance instruction which this mostly is.

2581763,5,B000FP2T0Y,"As a salsa dancer who occasionally teaches salsa lessons, I recommend this video to people wanting to learn the steps, and have purchased it for friends and family.  It teaches each step, one track at a time, for viewers to learn, then offers a couple of ""workouts"" at the end which mix up the steps.  It's also a decent workout if you enjoy salsa dancing already, and just want a mindless workout to stay in shape when you can't get out as much as you'd like.  I've seen only one or two other salsa videos that I'd recommend as much as this one, and many that I wouldn't recommend at all.  Good instruction, good pacing with many tracks, good workout, and enthusiastic, pleasant instructor.",1235520000,5,691,4.548387096774194
2581764,1,B000FP2T0Y,"I already knew the basic salsa steps before purchasing this, and had hoped/thought this would be a great way to use those steps in a workout setting.

WRONG! The instructor is boring, with no sense of rhythm. Neither he nor his partner can really move like good salsa dancers do. This guy is a complete hack, and his delivery is completely awkward. What's worse is that many of his steps are not even authentic salsa steps.

While salsa dancing can provide a good workout, this is NOT the DVD that fits the bill.

For those of you who want to learn salsa, DO NOT buy this DVD. Find someone who can truly dance salsa and learn from them!",1198800000,4,636,4.372881355932203

The salsa steps are covered too briefly and only from the man point of view (so ladies can't learn their steps), but at the other side the steps you need to learn are too complex for a workout.

""Whoo, almost lost my balance"", he says at one point.  It seems like the same basic step over and over with slight variations, like a tap.  It's not 'fun and energetic' - it's repetitive and boring.  He does the same routine 3 times with different  music.  For the price, get something else.",1178323200,13,428,4.552631578947368
