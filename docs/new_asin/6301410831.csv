332065,5,6301410831,"Cousins is the most romantic movie in my collection. It didn't aim to be great art, but it did manage to be a touching story. It's a remake of a French film but I don't think it suffers by the comparison. Ted Danson and  Isabella Rossellini star in the film as the two lovers, Larry and Maria.  Unfortunately they are both married, to other people.

The two of  them are thrown together during a series of weddings and funerals and they  share a bond of  adultery. Not their own, but their spouses. At first the  responsibility each of them feels toward their respective families,  prevents them from taking their attraction for each other any further. As a  result we are treated to a bitter sweet suspense. Harry and Maria, whilst  not consummating their relationship, use the situation to gain a subtle  retribution on their partners.

In addition to the central love  story there are lots of side plots. These conspire to create more weddings  and funerals than in any other film I have seen. Of course this is the  perfect excuse to throw our controversial couple together again and again.  I also enjoy watching Larry's son and Father interact. Both are interesting  characters.

Along with the subplots, there are a host of  supporting characters who do a lot to make the story more real. Larry's  father and son are both terrific and the illicit lovers who start it all  are wonderfully shallow. Here we see the true 80's love affair; hedonistic  and almost unrepenting.

Cousins renews your faith in human  nature. It recharges the batteries of your romance and makes you feel like  doing something wonderful for your special loved ones. If you are tired of  watching films where sex seems to be used as a weapon between enemies, then  give this film another look.",957398400,25,1773,4.727868852459016
332066,4,6301410831,This movie was so great it was a heart warming love story that all woman should see.,954028800,,84,4.0
332067,2,6301410831,"Ten years ago I saw COUSINS at the movies and wondered why, after the first wedding scene, how William Peterson got invited to the second wedding in the film.

Lead actor Ted Danson does a good job in COUSINS and his  performance alone makes it worth seeing, if only on cable TV.  Danson could  have played it safe in his career outside of ""Cheers"", playing  only Sam Malone-type characters (which he does in A FINE MESS).  But in work  such as SOMETHING ABOUT AMELIA and, in this case, COUSINS, he's willing to  challenge his fans with, to say the least, controversial subject  matter.

Despite the premise, COUSINS beyond the kissin' is not too  compelling, except for the late, loony Lloyd Bridges, the above-mentioned  Peterson, and of course Ted Danson.  Give COUSINS a try on cable TV;  perhaps you will like it more than I did.  But if you don't, at least you  will not have travelled to a theatre and spent money, as I did, to find  that out.",944006400,,950,4.5266272189349115
332068,5,6301410831,It was a good movie but I never would have watched it except for the fact that William Petersen was in it.,932342400,,106,3.8636363636363638
332069,1,6301410831,"While I have great respect for the director of St. Elmo's Fire and A Time to Kill, this box-office failure is truly a weak, meandering melodrama that does not deserve to be watched. While the plot may not be the worst part of  the film, the saccharine aloofness with which the subject matter is treated  is enough to bore and disappoint anyone who has seen at least one good  romantic comedy in his or her life. The last five minutes of the movie may  be redeemed somewhat by a lyrical musical score and a few beautiful scenes  in Schumacher's usual style; however, you are still most likely to leave  the room in an empty mood of deep disappointment. If you don't find The  Lost Boys, Batman & Robin and 8mm sufficient proof that even the  creator of some essential movies of the last two decades can have his dark  hours, see this movie, and it is almost guaranteed that you'll change your  mind. Otherwise, watch out and see Falling Down instead.",929059200,,949,4.497076023391813

First time renting a video here, & had to sign up online at Amazon before watching on the Roku. Good, smooth experience, will do again for newer or hard-to-find movies, but I'll mostly stick to what I'm already paying for at Prime & Netflix.

The film itself has a good script & very good characterization. The acting is very good, especially the interplay between grandad Bridges and grandson. Peterson's a little over the top as the predictable bad guy, but shows growth as does Young. Predictable ending but this is a feel-good movie after all.

COUSINS: The original film was about a real affair, and scandalized even the ""sexually sophisticated"" French. The American massage pitches it to a platonic level--long enough at least for us (and them) to be sure they're really, really in love. Then...vive la France! It helps immeasurably that the personality roles are impeccably clear: Tish and Tom are b***h and b*****d, in counterpoint to Larry and Maria's innocent sincerity and saint-like suffering for their moral convictions--and for daring to want to be happy!

For the film to work, Larry and Maria must convince us that you don't have to be an infidel to commit an infidelity. It helps that they are a lovely couple: Danson, smart and charming; Rossellini, the image of childlike wonder, with her full moon face, crescent moon smile and sun-wide eyes. Watching them warm up to each other is the real treat of the flick: The smiles grow wider, the patter more flirtatious, the spaces between them slowly close... It's an undeniable charmer, placing the pair in the center of a whirlwind of energetic eccentrics, using fun to lead us gently into wonder, heartache--and (Spoiler Alert!) a happy ending.",1421884800,,1420,4.863636363636363

2) great dialogue--something about trying to make ""chicken salad"" out of ""chicken s_ _ _"" that amuses me to this day
3) great movie about sex, but no on-screen sex--says a lot about how subtle a film maker can be and still make his point, and Joel Schumacher is not known for his subtlety

However, I would like to put in a plug for the original French version of this movie ""Cousin, Cousine"", which I saw in the theatre in the mid-70's.  As good as this remake is - and the fact that Hollywood did such a good job on it is amazing in itself - the original was still better.

332808,5,6301410831,"Lloyd Bridges is BRILLIANTLY hilarious in this movie. MAN he is so funny. It is his best next to Airplane.

Everyone else in it is fabulous as well. It is a really interesting love story and the characters have such great chemistry in it. It takes you through a broad range of reactions to many of the characters. Not many movies do that--it is really cool.

It's also shot in beautiful British Columbia in the summer and they do such a great job of incorporating that scenery into the movie.

And Sean Young is great in it too.

A must-see.",1179273600,,541,4.38

It is so much fun to watch their relationship develop from two people who are hurt by their significant others to a couple who find they are madly in love.

In a world filled will hourly reminders of hatred and sadness, I need the occasional escape into a world where true love really does win, and jerks get what they deserve in the end. The performances are spot on, and the cinematography is wonderful. If a romantic comedy can be considered ""elegant,"" then this one is. Bravo.",1169942400,2,592,4.247787610619469

Everything from the story line to the character development to the music is fantastic.  I have watched it many a time, and each time I get the same wonderful enjoyment.

332835,4,6301410831,"4.5 stars. I was walking up and down the aisles of my local video store the other day and I was getting frustrated.  The new release I wanted to rent wasn't there, none of the films on my short rental list were even available.  So I wandered the aisles, sulking, when I noticed a movie I hadn't seen in years.  It was ""Cousins,"" with Ted Danson and Isabella Rossellini.  Why not?  I really didn't remember much about it other than rave critical reviews from the time.  I was a teenager at the time so it is not really surprising that I don't remember a romance film.  That was the last thing on my mind.  Anyway, I got it home, dished up some spaghetti, and sat down to watch an ""okay"" movie.  I was pleasantly surprised to find myself interested in the goings on of each and every character in this large ensemble cast.  But the throughline story involves the two main actors, Ted and Isabella.  Their romance is both realistic and fantastical, where they are able to see all the wonders of the world merely by staring into each other's eyes.  Now, at first that may sound sappy. Believe me, I'm the last man on Earth to be attracted to a romance film, but somehow this one got to me.  It could have been Isabella Rossellini, who for a large part of the film resembled her gorgeous mother, Ingrid Bergman.  It was like watching a ""classic romance"" filmed for a different era, Mrs. Bergman's daughter absolutely glowing like her mother used to.  There are also obvious nods to the film ""Moonstruck"" with its sometimes quirky characters caught in realistic situations.  This movie could have been called ""3 Weddings and a Funeral.""  It has a Hollywood ending, complete with sailing off toward the horizon, all the couple's dreams coming true, but somehow I loved it.  I must be getting old. :)  What's impossible to believe is that this was directed by Joel Schumacher, who directed the abysmal ""Batman and Robin.""  It's really too bad he didn't stay with films about real people, because this film shines.  This is a nearly lost, mostly forgotten gem of a film, and it is easy to recommend.",1077580800,43,2090,4.564516129032258
332836,5,6301410831,"I have watched this movie a dozen times, and I never tire of it.  It is just a beautiful love story and Isabella R. and Ted Danson have wonderful chemistry.  It is one of those movies where you laugh and cry and it leaves you feeling better for having seen it.  The soundtrack alone is worth watching the movie.  One of my all time favorites.",1061683200,5,342,4.2153846153846155

When we parted this movie made me realise that life is what you make it. I love the fact that Ted's character just wants to be happy! Don't we all? I still love my first love and she knows this too, and I'll always remember this beautiful story about two people falling in love against the odds.
I suggest if you are a cynic about love then get this movie and watch it and realise that life is what we make it, be responsible for your own emotions and try to live everyday like the day is the last.
I am now going to buy this movie so i can watch it and remember again.

332841,5,6301410831,"This movie is such a touching tender movie. Granted it is based on an adulterous affair, but that  element is overshadowed by the love you can feel coming through the characters.  I don't think I have ever seen Ted Danson act finer than this. It shows he has true acting range. Isabella, nothing  needs to be said about her other than she has once again has proven herself a true star. As much as you would love to hate Sean Young and William Peterson, you can't help but grow to like them, as you watch their characters develop. Excellent acting job on both their parts. The settings are beautiful, the directing was wonderful. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to feel good about and believe in the power of true love. BRAVO to the entire cast of tis amazingly sweet movie!!!!",1019865600,7,795,4.506944444444445

332843,5,6301410831,"For once Ted Danson does himself justice as an actor.  Of course he is helped by the delectable Isabella Rossellini and the superb Sean Young in a love story with a difference.  Danson is a dance instructor, Rossellini a  housewife who become cousins by marriage when they meet at the wedding of  her mother to his uncle.  At the same wedding Danson's wife played by Sean  Young meets Rossellini's husband, handsomely portrayed by William Petersen.  An affair ensues and it is only a matter of time before their respective  spouses find out.  But when Danson and Rossellini do find out they decide  on a perfect revenge. They pretend that they too are having an affair.  This is done gently, with great humour and many funny moments, like when  Danson buys Rossellini a hat because her husband ""hates them"" and  Rossellini does the same with boxer shorts and it's not long before their  philandering partners are getting a taste of their own medicine.  Add to  this Danson's crotchety father ably played by Lloyd Bridges who turns up  when his brother dies of a heart attack, as well as Danson's teenage son  who wants to be a horror movie director, and you have a delightful comedy  filled with great moments that leave you chuckling away whilst at the same  time wiping away the occasional tear from your eye.  The story line could  be complicated but isn't though it might take you a few minutes to sort out  who is related to whom in the film!  It is a nice love story about how two  people who fall in love and have to make up their mind whether they stay  together or try to make their marriages work.  As well as this you have the  blossoming love between Rossellini's mother (now widowed) and Danson's  father, watch the scene when Danson's son helps his grandfather get ready  for his first date, it's hilarious.  All in all this is a great film and  the music score is absolutely brilliant.  So for a film that is gentle,  funny and touching don't look any further, ""Cousins"" is all you  need.",961804800,25,2003,4.577903682719547
