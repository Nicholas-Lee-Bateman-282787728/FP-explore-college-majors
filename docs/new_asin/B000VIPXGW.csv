8218887,5,B000VIPXGW,"the late Irish McCalla was one of the greatest Western artists I have ever known.  Her oils and charcoals were amazing and frankly I know more about her as an artist than as an actress.  I never really saw her Sheena series until a friend recently gave us Volume 1.  I bought the next two volumes as a tribute.  Another actress friend of ours, also deceased, Jane Greer told us how she met Irish on location and found she was being paid less than the average day laborer.  Irish was set straight on how she was taken advantage of.  I can't vouch for her acting as how much can you do in material like Sheena, though it is enjoyable.  She does seem to get tied up a lot.  However, she is a very warm human being and I enjoyed meeting her at an autograph show several years ago.  She and my wife hit it off big time as we already had the art in our home and it is my wife's favorite.  Not enough is known about this woman and it is a shame.  Buy this DVD, but if you can find her art, there's the real investment.",1207958400,,1011,4.055555555555555
