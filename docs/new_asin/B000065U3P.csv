1708871,1,B000065U3P,"If Hollywood needs to make a pro-this or pro-that movie, more power to them. All I ask is that they make said movie realistic and enjoyable. This is a long PSA in favor of homosexuality. I have to believe, based on the generic blandness of this movie, not to mention the lack of realism in events and dialogue and the poor acting, that event the most ardent gay supporter blushed with embarrassment. I have seen middle school plays that had better acting and were more authentic. Nothing about the short bit I watched was remotely realistic. Annette O'Toole is as frumpy a school marm as they come, and Lenny as a Lawyer? Implausible!

The better name for this should have been Horrid Putrid.",1367280000,,692,4.626016260162602
1708872,2,B000065U3P,"I beg to differ with the 4- and 5-star reviews.  This was simply another second-rate tv movie with mediocre acting, a ""twisted"" plot (as opposed to a plot with twists and turns), and often awkward dialogue and/or timing. It is a 2-star movie at best.",1367193600,8,250,4.555555555555555
1708873,1,B000065U3P,But it kept freezing and the struggle to get it going again constantly was just too much. That has been my streaming experience with Amazon lately. Don't know why and Amazon has not been helpful in telling me how to correct this.,1365638400,,229,4.476190476190476
1708874,1,B000065U3P,A conplete waste of time.  The plot is terrible and the acting is worse.  If I wasn't working third shift and it wasn't 0237 i would have turned it off after 3 minutes,1365552000,9,167,4.03030303030303
1708875,5,B000065U3P,"I enjoyed this movie. The alternate justice that prevailed made the movie all that more believable. The story of a sister losing it and kidnapping the lawyer responsible for getting her brother's murderer off scott free and her anger that the murderer was then making money for ""his"" story on top of the life insurance while her brother's reputation was dragged through the mud and causing their mother emotional distress and hurt in the process as the victim became the persecuted. Well, don't want to spoil it for you. Acting was superb and great plot well worth watching and left a satisfying feeling at the end of the movie that even when justice isn't truly served, what goes around comes around.",1365292800,,701,4.801652892561983
1708876,4,B000065U3P,A strong look back 30 odds years to the days of Aids phobia. Another disturbing view of how the Law system can be manipulated for the worst. It is without doubt the best acting I have seen from Michael McKean.,1339113600,,209,4.25
1708877,5,B000065U3P,"Everything about this movie was very well done and the acting was amazing. Annette O'Toole did such a good job in this movie i can not even put it into words. Michael McKean did great as well, and seeing him do a serious role other then his usual comedy was great to see. Over all, this is a very good movie and i think everything who see's it will not be disappointed.",1172102400,10,369,4.138888888888889
1708878,5,B000065U3P,"If you love Annette, you'll love this movie. She is awesome in it. If you don't love her, it is still a great movie. If you've ever secretely dreamed of getting revenge, then dream on. I love it when she makes him.... ah ""wet himself"". I laughed till I cried. Oh by the way, she later married the creep in real life.
This is one of Annette's better movies.",1024272000,26,356,4.173913043478261

1708901,4,B000065U3P,"The film feels a bit dated, but is worth watching. Annette O'Toole is fabulous in her portrayal of Gwen, the sister of a murder victim whose murderer gets off by his attorney's focus on vilifying the victim. On the spur of the moment, Gwen kidnaps Hammond, the defense attorney, and tries to see if he can feel any remorse for his tactics. When she goes on trial for his kidnapping, a successful attorney asks to defend her because it is every attorney's dream to square off with Hammond. The end has a surprise twist that I never saw coming and I usually have these kind of movies figured out way before the end. Enjoy!",1476921600,,620,4.447368421052632

1709032,1,B000065U3P,"Not plausible. The attorney didn't fight back. He was handcuffed to the footed bath tub for crying out loud. They don't bolt those down. Then she handcuffed him to a rickety chair. I wish they showed how she undressed and dressed him without him overpowering her. Even with handcuffs, he could hit her in the head. The attorney sounded a little like John Ritter. I kept thinking this was like Chrissy tying up Jack Tripper as a zany stunt... ""Come and knock on our door...  We've been waiting for you....  Where the kisses are hers and hers and his,  Three's company too."" Okay, sorry about that. I was having a little flashback. So then I'm thinking this movie is like a cross between ""Midnight Run"" and ""Misery, except that those movies were good. So anyway, it hits me, how great would it be if Kathy Bates was in a movie with Charles Grodin. Kathy: ""Now the time has come. I put two bullets in my gun. One for me, and one for you. Oh darling, it will be so beautiful."" Charles: Uh, I don't like guns. They scare me. Put the gun down. Can I ask you something? Have you properly maintained that gun? You know, they can explode if you don't clean them properly. Can you take these cuffs off me, Kathy? They hurt really bad.""  Okay back to the movie. I don't want to spend too much time on it though, so let me finish up. Annette O'Toole's character changed so much, I thought she might have multiple personality disorder. Prim and proper. Angry. Gloomy. Happy and laughing. Immature. Misty eyed. One person can't be all those things. Unless of course you are Sally Field in ""Sybil"".  Sally: I don't want to see the kitty cat."" ""I'm going to New York"". ""I want my suitcase"". ""Don't come next to me."" They said not to go to the movies."" ""Do I go to the movies? No.""  Yeah. That's more like it. And Sally, you may be crazy, but you know not to go to the movies...especially when the movie is ""Final Justice"".",1427241600,,1906,4.385269121813031

1709064,1,B000065U3P,"Was it the editor, director or writer that emasculated this movie - pun intended!

How could they? Make the almost-brilliant plan of a victim's sister to outsmart a brilliant vicious lawyer succeed due to a fluke? There was no need for that at all. It made her look dumb. She could have planned the taping and stated that it was random while staging the coffee incident a without a hitch. She could have easily let the guy escape making him think he was smart enough to escape. No hint of either was there - thus making a good movie terrible in 20 seconds.

1709175,4,B000065U3P,"Have you ever wondered why attorneys at trial or deposition are never put under oath?  Corollary question:  how can you tell when a lawyer is lying?  This is a story which is quite on point regarding legal ethics or lack thereof.  The concept is fine and deserving of broader discussion--ie, when a trial about a murdered man is made out to be (by the defense attorney) a trial of the decedent's homosexuality.  Although it should be obvious that a person's sexual preference does not have anything to do with the fact that a murder can be excused because of it.  The actors were good, tho not great.  This movie somehow did not generate the tension that a ""grade A"" picture should possess.  Therefore, ""Final Justice"", although posing some interesting ethical problems, is a ""B movie""---not bad, but yet missing the mark.",1398902400,,822,4.780141843971631

1709178,4,B000065U3P,"Being a former law student and continuously involved in studysing aspects of the legal system, I find this film, though fictional, captivating for several reasons.  Not the least of which, is how skewed toward those with property and money it has become!.  Having the power to influence decisions has taken Justice out of all court proceedings and made a mockery of the Jurisprudence System.  Every State Dept. of Corrections level of law enforcement has made inappropriate and legally binding decisions through our errant precedent setting system fallible and just plain wrong.  People today without money or property are urged by court appointed attorneys normally Public Defenders to urge their clients to plead guilty and enter into a faulty and disgusting deceitful apparatus full of chicanery, artifice, and deception.  This film highlights the process by which this system is perped on an unsuspecting public who could care less what happens to the lower end of the economic spectrum.  That's why so many Capital Cases have been reversed once the suppressed ""real evidence"" is opened for a full airing of the facts rather than the plea bargain agreements leading to a conviction of an innocent party often placing them on death row!!",1397779200,,1240,5.175

This is a twist to the corrupt attorneys getting the bad guy off. However, this script makes it work.  The filming and directing is top notch.

It omitted vulgarity and sexual content to make it's point and the moral of the story was well portrayed.

I'm a big fan of Annette and she certainly shines in this venue. As another reviewer stated it is good to see Dennis in a serious role...he does make a good ""bad guy"" without fitting any stereotype per se.
