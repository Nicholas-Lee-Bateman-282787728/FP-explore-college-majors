8751204,3,B01BSW1OJ4,"Definitely not the Portland Wrestling I remember... this is the later era... no Playboy Buddy Rose, no Rip Oliver, no Assassin, and Billy Jack as a one night only return to Portland?

The Flair Magnum match was cool, though.",1485993600,,224,4.743589743589744
8751205,5,B01BSW1OJ4,Great DVD covering a special time in Wrestling. The Portland crew is highlighted here and just like the other Portland Vol 1 release they do one thing well. They Wrestle!!! Relive the old days and old style ways with this action packed DVD. Read were there will be 3 ore coming out. Also got the Billy Jack Haynes Vol 1 as well. All 3 are well done !!!,1485302400,,352,4.1911764705882355
8751206,2,B01BSW1OJ4,video quality was bad like recorded from a VHS tape,1482710400,,51,4.2
8751207,4,B01BSW1OJ4,"Parts one and two are great. The dvds include interviews and promos as well as matches. Great to see Tom Peterson and Don Owen, especially when Don mispronounces the wrestlers names. Buddy and Rip are so memorable. Remember Rip as Santa Claus? Only wish the quality was better but it is probably the same quality as when it aired 35 yrs ago.",1480982400,3,341,4.516129032258065
