7793754,5,0964568373,"I am so grateful for my good health at 70+ and attribute this to staying active.  Balance is something everyone needs every single day and we take it for granted! I am still an avid hiker and use trekking poles to help balance on inclines and slopes, but most important is my own sense of good balance - hiking or just performing daily chores.  Everyone can improve this important aspect of their life.  Carol Dickman's Balance fun and therapeutic  for those who want to reclaim their confidence and balance.  It is upbeat and happy with the bright lights of Vegas!!  I think it is a wonderful ""get well"" and ""stay well""gift  and will be of great benefit to those who are trying to maintain or regain their active lifestyle.  Thank you, Carol Dickman!!  : )",1398643200,,757,4.548148148148148

The music doesn't match the movement (other dvd's have no music) and there is no yoga or serenity in these.  They are calesthenics, done distractedly in LV.  Not useful for my balance issues.",1386806400,2,262,4.6521739130434785
