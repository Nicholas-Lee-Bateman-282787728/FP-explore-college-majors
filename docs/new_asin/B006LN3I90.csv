8500415,2,B006LN3I90,"The Lost Squadron is a 1932 black and while drama from RKO about 3 WW 1 aviators (Richard Dix, Joel McCrea, Robert Armstrong) who work in Hollywood as stunt pilots. It was the first film produced by David O Selznick.

Richard Dix (1893-1949) was RKOs leading man during the 30s. He started in 1917 and had made 50 films prior to talkies. He plays the romantic lead.

Robert Armstrong (1890-1973) will always be best known for his role as hunter Carl Denham in this film and the original, as well as Mighty Joe Young (1949) even though he performed in 160 films including Palooka (1934), G Men (1935). Man of Conquest (1939) and Blood on the Sun (1945).

Joel McCrea (1905-90) had a long career starting in the silent film era, and appeared in more than 50 films, usually as a hero in westerns  Wells Fargo (1937), Union Pacific (1939), The Virginian (1946), and Four Faces West (1948). But McCrea wasn't limited to western films, and he gave good performances in films such as Foreign Correspondent (1940) and Sullivans Travels (1941), although I think his best job was in Ride the High Country (1952).

Mary Astor (1906-87) plays Armstrongs sister. Astor is best remembered as Mrs. OShaughnessy from The Maltese Falcon (1941), although she won the Oscar for her role in The Great Lie which appeared the same year and is now mostly forgotten. Astor made more than 100 films from 1921 to 1964 (Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte) and was a major star in the silent era.

Erich von Stroheim (1885-1957) plays a Hollywood director. Von Stroheim was a famous German silent film director (Greed, The Merry Widow) but he got into too many arguments when the talkie era started, and he turned to acting. Von Stroheim is perhaps best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as the film director Max Von Mayerling in Sunset Blvd (1950).

The film is directed by George Archainbaud (1890-1959), known primarily for his TV westerns (Gene Autry, Annie Oakley, Buffalo Bill). This is probably his best known film.

The best feature of this film is the stunning air photography, shot by Edward Cronjager (1904-60) who received 7 Oscar nominations (Cimaron, Heaven Can Wait), but never won.

Films about airplanes were popular even in the silent era with Wings (1927). Films in which flying airplanes has featured prominently include The Dawn Patrol (1930), Hells Angels (1930), Flying Tigers (1942), Wing and a Prayer (1944), Twelve OClock High (1950), The High and the Mighty (1954), Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), Top Gun (1986), Always (1989), Air America (1990), Memphis Belle (1990), and Tuskegee Airmen (1995).

1932 was a good year for films  Grand Hotel was the Oscar and box office king, but Jean Harlow had 2 films in the top 10 (Red Headed Woman and Red Dust) as did Miriam Hopkins (Trouble in Paradise and Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) and Wallace Beery (Champ and Grand Hotel). Other notable films from that year were I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Freaks, A Farewell to Arms, Scarface, Horse Feathers and Tarzan The Ape Man.

The NY Times said the film has a rich vein of originality and clever dialogue. It is an excellent melodrama, ably directed Variety said The behind the scenes of an aerial film production is the best appeal Squadron has but lamented the dramatics are a bit strained.

Bottom line  Of value for the great aerial photography, but the story itself will seem dated and melodramatic.",1396483200,,3447,4.800675675675675
8500416,4,B006LN3I90,"4 buddy WWI pilots, out of work after the war, start doing stunt flying on a Hollywood movie, directed by the evil Eric Von Stroheim (in an enjoyably over the top performance).  Of course, as absurd luck would have it the leader of the squads ex-girlfriend is now married to Von Stroheim, though she hates him.

Spoilers ahead!

Von Stroheim plots to try to get his wifes ex-lover killed in an impossible stunt, and is going to make sure by putting acid on the control cables, but another flyer goes in his place and dies, and the remaining 3 grab Von Stroheim to get their revenge, leading to a tense, dark but pretty silly conclusion. Theres a lot thats cool here.  The photography is quite nice, with a modern, flowing feeling unusual in early sound films.  The last third of the film has a dark, moody sort of proto film noir  look and feel.  And the performances are pretty retrained and naturalistic for early 30s  Hollywood as well.  It only grew on a 2nd viewing.

There is also a region 2 DVD from Spain available.",1344816000,2,1023,4.481081081081081
