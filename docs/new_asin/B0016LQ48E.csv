8263089,3,B0016LQ48E,"(I am also a power [vinyasa] yoga instructor.)
This is about a 45-minute low-intermediate level power yoga routine followed by an extra ten minutes of corework. The corework seems odd at the end and I wish it would have been part of the rest of the practice, before the final relaxation.

The instruction is pretty good, and the routine flows well. It isn't particularly interesting -- there's nothing here that you haven't seen in other routines of the same style. What disappointed me is that this DVD is not advanced. It's fairly vigorous, but contains NO level 3 or 4 postures as the cover states. I really enjoyed Power YogaFit (I seem to be in the minority on that), and found it much more difficult and more distinctive than this one, even though it's only 38 minutes.",1226966400,5,775,4.656934306569343
