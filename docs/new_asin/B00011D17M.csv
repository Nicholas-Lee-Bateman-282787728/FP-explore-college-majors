1964791,5,B00011D17M,"If you like the Lotte Berk method.. you'd really like this.  The moves are low-impact but man do they burn!  You really feel your muscles getting shaped and toned into something strong and beautiful.  I played soccer throughout college, graduated last year, and this burns my thighs.

I love the fact that the instructor is in her late 50s and looks incredible.  Very encouraging.  It's a good whole-body toning workout.  It's not exactly aerobic, but this workout is a great alternative to weight-lifting.. especially if you're like me and your body can't handle hi-impact weight-lifting.

On top of it all, I actually enjoy working out with this tape!",1140220800,13,653,4.981481481481482
1964792,5,B00011D17M,"This is great firming workout for your body.  This is definatly along the lines of CALLINESTICS and LOTTE BERK.  It is a little faster than LOTTE BERK.  But I would still say that all three workouts are excellent for toning and firming.  But do not think that you are going to lose extra weight by this workout alone, if anything you will lose inches.  If I had two problems with this workout it would be that it is not long and there is no cardio.  This video is better for those who are at their goal weight and just want to tone up.

P.S.  If you have problems with your knees you might want to try callanetics first or a Ballet video.",1120780800,15,638,4.172131147540983
1964793,5,B00011D17M,"I love this video. Its great the first few sessions because she explains everything very detailed, but after you get everything down pat the video becomes annoying.  I usually have the remote in one hand to fast-forward through her explaining how to do a move.  But it's well worth it.  My thighs and butt have never sizzled so well.  The best part is that I am starting to say bye-bye to my cellulite.  I have cellulite on the back of my thighs and as of today its not very visible! I have used this video for two months and have seen MAJOR Results!!!  My legs, butt, and abs still feel that next day pain! I recommend this video to everyone who wants to tone up his or her body!",1073260800,96,680,4.232558139534884
1964794,5,B00011D17M,It seems like an easy workout because I am not jumping around. Yet. I sweat and feel like every muscle has been worked out and I do not sweat easily. I checked it out at the library first and kept it checked out till my own came in the mail. I use workout videos everyday and this one is one of my favorites.,1381968000,3,308,3.9047619047619047

1964797,3,B00011D17M,"Yes my thighs burned and I felt it the next day but this left me feeling like I'd had a workout session in an old age home. It's way, way too short and if the workout was an extra 20 minutes I'd give it 5 stars. I feel the whole thing is just out of date. Don't waste your money.",1370476800,2,279,3.6666666666666665
1964798,4,B00011D17M,"I'd recommend this DVD to folks who are just getting into exercising or who are new to Bar Method. However, as a low-intermediate level exerciser (i.e. I can jog a 12-minute mile comfortably, and am ok in a level 2 yoga class), who has taken a few Bar Method and bar method-type classes in person, this was a little too easy and slow-paced for me. It's the catch-22 of exercise DVDs: either there's not enough explanation and you're left scratching your head about what exactly you're supposed to be doing, or you're waiting impatiently to actually start exercising.

Pros:
*very good setup explanation of form and good cuing so that you get back into form in case you've fallen out of it.
*non-annoying music
*pleasant lead instructor
*some modifications showed to make things easier

Cons:
*once you're familiar with how to setup, the explanations can feel interminably long, and I don't like having to fast forward through them, although I guess another solution would be to just add extra reps while she's setting up
*not that much upper body work - limited to pushups and tricep dips
*although the moves are as hard as you make them - go lower and your legs start shaking, for example - there were some key moves that I felt were missing such as the pretzel

Good DVD for beginners, but if you're ok on form and looking for something faster-paced and/or harder I'd recommend the Physique 57 DVDs or Bar Method Designer Sculpting.

As for results, I have definitely seen results doing barre-based workouts. My goal was to firm up rather than lose weight, and I've noticed that my hips have slimmed down, my butt has lifted, and I've got more definition in my arms in less than 3 weeks of doing these workouts about 3xs a week (in addition to yoga or running/walking twice a week, which I was already doing.)",1342569600,4,1811,4.667711598746082
1964799,5,B00011D17M,This is a great workout for toning your body using the bar method principles - I love that you stretch each body part after you work it.  I also got a great deal on this VHS at around $5.  It definitely has made me decide to purchase more of this style of workout.,1323475200,,264,3.9622641509433962
1964800,4,B00011D17M,"The workout is great! DVD works as described. The cover looks like a reprint but I'm not sure if the original appears that way or it IS a reprint. Makes no difference to me, really... As long as the picture quality is good. I'd recommend it.",1320105600,,241,4.260869565217392
1964801,3,B00011D17M,This video is alright for beginners. I'm an intermediate exerciser and dancer. I thought this would be a great cross-training tool but I felt like it was a little too lax for my tastes. It'd be a great toning video for beginners or those who need a really low impact workout (ie. injuries).,1300579200,2,290,4.490566037735849

1964803,3,B00011D17M,"I have taken Lotte Berk classes for a six yr period.  This was a bit of a let down.  Barely any arms, 20 movements or so on each area, in class you would do about 30plus.  It does not compare to the class if you are trying to use this as an alternative.  It would be good for a beginner.",1280793600,4,287,3.7333333333333334

1964806,5,B00011D17M,I would rent this dvd from the library and have done it several times and love the results so I wanted to buy it but only found it here.  I love how I look I'm in good shape and this makes me look leaner and I love how my backside looks:),1242518400,2,238,3.6666666666666665
1964807,4,B00011D17M,"This video is great for beginners.  Teaches you to stretch properly. Easy to follow instructions, but not just an easy workout if you are just starting out. Not super for abs, but helps with flexibility.",1240790400,3,203,4.8
1964808,5,B00011D17M,"Because I can't walk or sit! This is an amazing routine! This will work especially well for people who want to tone up more than they want to lose weight, because you will see results in no time at all. Highly recommended. If you're new to this, go easy on how low you go with the dips and squats.",1216512000,4,297,4.0508474576271185
1964809,5,B00011D17M,"After years of only doing cardio exercises I realized that I needed strengthening exercises as well. I tried the usual exercises:  weights and squats but wasn't really happy with the results.  Plus, after 3-5 cardio workouts and 2 workouts with weights per week, I had no time for yoga which I really needed because a recent pregnancy had left me very stiff, especially in my back. Then I found The Bar Method: Fat free and the Lotte Berk dvds. Both methods are a combination of strenthening exercises and stretching to shape the muscles and improve flexibility. The advantage Fat Free has over the Lotte Berk dvds is that Fat Free works your whole body in one workout (the Lotte Berk dvds are shorter and focus on fewer areas of the body in each workout).  The exercises are great--generally using body weight and small movements to achieve the results. I particularly like how the exercises are efficient: for example the push-ups work your whole upper body at once and the standing seat exercises work both the moving leg and the standing leg. The reverse push-ups are great for the triceps (they're similar to tricep dips, only on the floor so you lift more of your body weight). After each section, there are stretches for the muscles you've just worked as well as a general stretching section at the end. The stretching is supposed to shape the muscles you've just worked. My flexibility has improved tremendously because of the stretching.  My muscles are more defined: my arms and legs are starting to look shapely for the first time in years and I feel stronger.  If you like pilates and yoga you may like this workout.  If you're like me and want to be both stronger and more flexible, you will benefit from this method.",1191024000,22,1730,4.711920529801325
1964810,4,B00011D17M,"I have been exercising all my life and i'm in pretty good shape but age is kicking in and lack of motivation is as well. This video has effectively toned my thighs and butt as well as my arms. My legs still shake when I do the exercises. I particularly didn't like the abs however I probably am too advanced and I think it is more for a beginner. Overall, I love this video and will continue to use it.",1186012800,7,402,4.0375
1964811,5,B00011D17M,"I am so happy with this workout.  I had owned Designer Sculpting and really dreaded doing it, so eventually got rid of it.  However, with all the hype about this program on my favorite exercise websites, I really wanted to see if this other program would be different.  After trying it through Netflix, I bought it and am so pleased.  The abdominal section is less of a contortion, the upper body gets a better workout - without those weights, and for all who swear by that pretzel move, I really find the standing legwork takes care of the same areas.  The only dread is that it leaves me quite sore and I can't necessarily do it 3 times per week!",1176163200,26,648,4.366666666666666
1964812,4,B00011D17M,"This is different than typical aerobics videos. The instructor uses some original and some ballet-like exercises to target tough areas.  The motions are simple yet effective, and designed to isolate muscles and increase stability.  Since this isn't an aerobic workout, I think it is best to use this video on your ""Day Off"" from your other workouts to work on flexibility & stability.

The simple movements are appropriate for both beginners and intermediate, because the intensity depends on how much you put into it.

I like how the workout is no impact (no jumping around), and no special equipment is needed.

The instructor really emphasizes proper posture/form, especially what she calls the ""pelvic tuck"" (tightening your abs when standing)

She cues/explains the exercises very well; and once you've learned the moves, the DVD has the option to ""Workout with music WITHOUT NARRATION"" so you don't have to listen to her talk constantly. I also like how upbeat music and didn't find it annoying because the music varies throughout the program.

Plie, releve, leg stretch

Pushup, reverse pushups, arm stretch

Thigh presses (like mini-squats), pelvic tuck, leg stretch

Hip extensions (effective!), hip flexion, hip stretch

Lean back while on knees

Ab contractions, ab/back stretch

Bridges/pelvic tucks (killer!), butt/leg stretches

Bonus workout: ab contractions

As you can see, each segment is followed by relevant stretching, which I think is appropriate.

However, since I personally get impatient with so much stretching/slownees, I personally like the ""Bar Method:  Designer Sculpting""  video more than this one.",1172188800,18,1629,5.422310756972111
1964813,4,B00011D17M,"This is set on a large studio with painted brick wall & 3 in good shape women backing up Burr Leonard who looks great at her age. Burr & one woman is using a bar while the other 2 are using a strong high backed wood chair. The music is synthesizer, but not too bad. The cool down has great Engima like chanting music by Daveed.

Here is basic the breakdown of this workout, though not perfect in time.

Starts with a 3 min min intro.

The next 3 min is wide pliates & going on your toes followed with 2 good leg stretches & 1 simple torso stretch.

Next for 4 min is push-ups while on your knees, child's pose in yoga, then reverse push ups (looks kinda like a very mild/beginner table pose in yoga) that are great for triceps. A simple arm stretch & standing foward bend ends it.

Next for 6 min is using a chair again, standing on your toes with straight legs & squating a tiny bit for a couple of min. After is the same with legs turned outward like a diamond. Next is pelvic crunches in that pose & a simple quad stretch & more leg stretches that are yoga inspired.

Next 8 min is standing on one leg & moving it backward only a few inches to work the butt. Then the other leg. Then lifting the leg to the side only a few iches then the other leg. Then stretching the legs while standing in a figure 4.

Next for 3 min is standing on one leg & lifting other very high backwards & lifting it an inch more in repitition & then the other leg. Then stretching the legs with a straight & bent leg.

Then for 4 min left the leg in front of you to your waist if posibble & moving it back/forth a few inches, then stretching the hip in a kneeling position. Next is kneeling & leaning the torso backwards to work the core muscles in a steady position, then again punching the air, then while doing hip circles. You then stretch the toso backward to relieve & a standing foward bend.

Next for 7 min is working the abs with a modified yoga boat pose with extra emphaiss on crunching the ab muscles with holding the legs, then holding one straight leg up, then the other w/o hands, then full boat pose. Then laying down knee to chest spinal twist stretch. Then cobra positions to work the lower back & child's pose.

More ab work for 8 min with modified small bridge pose yoga to work the lower back & butt & thighs, then laying down leg twist stretch, straight leg stretching while laying down, then seated wide legged single leg stetch.

There is a trailer for ""Bar Method Designer Sculpting"" on collagevideo com to get an idea.",1162684800,60,2523,4.1921487603305785
8005065,5,B00011D17M,Very fast delivery. Product was new in package at a used price,1490227200,,62,4.25
8005066,3,B00011D17M,"I do not recommend this if you don't have a lot of workout room.  I have a small workout space, and if I have to switch to the floor I need to move my chair and roll out my yoga mat.  With this workout, Burr is having you go back and forth.  She'll do floor work and then have you stand for a stretch, only to go back to the floor for abs, etc.  I found this highly annoying, as the flow just wasn't there for me.  I think this is a good workout if you have plenty of space.

Note that the arm workouts here are pushups and reverse pushups.  No weights are used.

And, due to Natural Journeys having to run their stupid ad in the beginning, which you cannot fast-forward out of, there is an additional star off.

I prefer the Bar Method Body over this workout.  The Bar Method has excellent workouts, I just wish they understood that a lot of us are not working out in large spaces at home.",1459814400,3,890,4.034285714285715
8005067,4,B00011D17M,"I bought this ages ago and only recently added it back into my rotation.  I wanted something for Friday evenings that didn't break a sweat but that actually worked me in a way other DVDs don't.

First off, major annoyance -- long, non skippable, non-fast-forwardable Natural Journeys (I think they got bought out by Gaiam, but I digress) advertisement at the beginning of the DVD.  Almost annoying enough to make me long for the days of VCRs again...

Anyway, the actual exercise program itself is about 45 minutes long, give or take.  There's lots of talk during the workout about how the workout will lengthen your muscles and such, and that is pretty much not supported by any kind of exercise science, but I ignore all of that.  If I can FEEL the workout, then it is doing something, and I can feel this one.

This does utilize a bar for the first part, although you can use a chair.  I have been using a chair.  It is not really the same (the height isn't quite right and wouldn't be for most dining chairs), but it is better than spending over one hundred and fifty dollars on a bar that I would only be using once a week.  If you have to use the chair, make sure to get a heavy one.  I am doing this with an IKEA desk chair and I have to be super careful not to tip it over...although you are usually just supposed to lightly support yourself with the bar, not put your full weight on it.  You will also need a strap.  You can use the belt from a bathrobe but I use a yoga strap.  This is only needed near the end to stretch the legs, and it is a good stretch and worth doing (but I have tight hamstrings so I think it really helps).

Some modifications are offered so you can follow along with the modifier if you need to (all of the time or just sometimes, depending on your fitness level).

I kind of wish the instructor didn't talk quite so much between exercises, but I guess you get a lot of short breaks.  I like that she is a bit older than your typical fitness instructor (I believe she was in her 50s when this was made, but this is fairly old -- the instructor is not the young model on the DVD cover).  Always happy to see diversity in fitness instructors.  Not everyone who exercises is a 20-something.  She is in very good shape and so are the other ladies who demonstrate alongside her.  She is clear and easy to understand.  The set is pretty standard for this type of DVD, not too distracting.  They are working out on carpet.  If you have a hard floor, you may want a rug, or at least a yoga mat for the floor portion of the workout.  Music is also appropriate for the workout.

This is solely a bodyweight workout, where you do a reasonable number of very tiny reps, maybe changing foot or leg position or something like that between sets.  It doesn't look like it would be difficult, and I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser (I've done a few rounds of P90X and P90X3 plus I regularly use a 20 pound kettlebell), but there are times when my muscles are shaking a bit.  This works me in a way that strength training with weights really doesn't.  You pretty much focus on the lower body and core here.  There are a few upper body moves but not really enough to build a ton of strength (though they might be challenging if you are new to resistance exercise).

Make sure you have a lot of room.  There are times when you stand half an arm's length away from the bar/chair and lift your leg out behind you and you don't really want to hit the wall.  You don't need as much room side-to-side -- just the length of your body for the lying down portion.

Stretches are integrated throughout the workout.  I am not sure how I feel about this.  I suppose it is more effective to stretch a muscle you have just worked.  However, I never really feel that my muscles are warm enough while doing this workout to really go all-out with the stretching.  Maybe because I have a high degree of cardiovascular fitness, I just need a bit more to my warmups.  I should probably walk on the treadmill for 5 or 10 minutes first.  May not be an issue if you are a beginner.

I can't really say what effect this is having on my body.  I am doing over an hour of cardio and a half hour of yoga every day and only working this in about once a week.  Because I am not doing this one too frequently, I feel the moves each and every time.  I don't think you are going to burn a ton of calories.  I do think you will get some small amount of muscle definition, in muscle groups that are not always worked so well with other types of resistance exercises, based on my results.  If you have joint trouble, well, there is no jumping around here and it is certainly better for you than sitting on the couch.",1455667200,2,4715,4.253093363329584

But I was looking for a video to do on my lighter workout days and this looked perfect. However, don't be fooled by the cover- she does NOT look like this in the video and the video is pretty much a waste of time unless you are planning to do this as an addition to a high level workout. I don't feel like I burned anything off at all and nothing was sore the next day. I also didn't like the change I was noticing in the positioning of my hips- my thighs started to rub together when I walked for the first time in my entire life and that was really uncomfortable so I discontinued use of this video.

This DVD teaches you the basic form for this ""ballet type"" of exercises, I love that you get to strecth after each exercise which makes your muscles more relaxed and lean. I challenge myself all the time, so I follow the main instructor, who by the way gives you a very detailed explanation of each exercise. This DVD is not up beat, however, it gives you the opportunity to concentrate, follow instructions at the same time while working your body constantly (low impact). Once you learn your correct form, then you are ready for The Bar Method and many more ballet exercises, this DVD is the perfect one to get you started. Note: this DVD is kind of old, ""the bar Method"" has so many others updated, but this is my favorite one to get me started (when I have been off from exercising)
Hope you enjoy this DVD as much as I do.
