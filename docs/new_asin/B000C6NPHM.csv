8096130,1,B000C6NPHM,"This is the worst movie ever! Screw historical points this move has no point other than to deeply sadden me. I do not see how descendants of slaves could attach their name to ""Way Down South""! The movie is unrealistic with happy sing slaves, buck eyed and loving the master (who is also happily sings with them) so much they would rather die before they leave him. Yeah I know it was obviously fictional, and a musical, but why would black people write these stupid lies and make it into a movie that now goes down in history. Everyone needs work but damn!
I would understand if ""Way Down South"" was written by a white person. I would also understand if the premise of the movie was on another subject, because then the slavery part of the movie would have been background data and more forgivable (Hey we made a movie about pre civil war era and these people did have slaves) This is a review quote I found online when I started looking to see if anyone else was as offended by this movie as I was. "" The film was notable for its casting of African American actors in central roles, and for tackling racial issues in the South""  What racial issues showing happy singing slaves is not addressing issues, no racial issues were ADDRESSED in this movie! What this movie did do for me is see the blatant lack of self-respect you would have to have yourself to write this movie as a descendent of slaves. I mean if you're going to address the issues lets at least make it realist if not accurate. Maybe it was meant to be a comedy but it AIN'T FUNNY!
This movie had wonderful rave reviews so much, so that that also deeply saddens me. Slavery and all of its subject matter is a serious part of history that the United States has never truly addressed but instead pushed into the closet, and kept quiet like a public secret.  This movie should be thrown in that closet with that part of history because it is an embarrassment to think people actually enjoyed this movie and still do 80 years later. It hurts my heart that people publicly care more about animals than they care about the imprisonment and discrimination of human people in US history. I rented this movie and it will not be returned I am going to buy it so at least 1 copy is out of circulation.",1315008000,2,2254,4.37708830548926
8096131,5,B000C6NPHM,Very good Bobby Breen film titled Way Down South put out on Roan DVD.  The Roan edition is the best out there on DVD.  It's a pretty good print with only one bad splice.  Titles are intact.,1259712000,3,189,4.054054054054054
