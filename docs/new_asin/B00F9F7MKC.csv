Seriously, I have watched numerous animes from a variety of sources and Fairy Tail is one of the best for its genre (action comedy).",1387238400,2,366,4.169014084507042
5971786,5,B00F9F7MKC,"If you haven't seen this I suggest you get it. It's like watching a mythic multicultural hodge podge, at least that's how I feel when I watch it. The character's are great and the english voice acting is fantastic, I can't get enough of Natsu(Todd Haberkorn) and have taken interest in a lot of his other work since I fell in love with this, thanks for an awesome show and keep up the good work guys and gals!",1387152000,,409,4.256410256410256
5971787,5,B00F9F7MKC,I can't wait to get the rest of the episodes to see what awaits everyone in the Fairy Tail guild.,1386806400,,97,3.9
5971788,5,B00F9F7MKC,"Fairy Tail Part 7 Starts off, admittedly, starts off with 4 filler episodes.
  Episode 73 ""Rainbow Cherry Blossoms"", I thought would be dull, made fun only by Wendy's occasional appearances. I was proved wrong. The plot at the beginning of the episode is slow, but long in short, Lucy gets sick after a mission, and lays awake in bed, an has flashbacks about everything she had been through in episodes leading up to that. Being that this is Fairy Tail, they did a good job (amazing actually) with flashbacks. Episode 73 is followed by ""Wendy's First Big Job!?"" which is an icebreaker for Wendy fans (me!) It's self explanatory: a funny, serious, and interesting episode about Wendy's First big Job. Following this is ""24 Hour Road Race Endurance"", which is also self explanatory. I will say the race at the end has an AMAZING 5 way tie, (with intense Fairy Tail music playing in the background), but the top 3 winners may surprise! you. Last of the filler episodes comes ""Gildarts"" which is the introduction of Fairy Tail's supposed strongest member, and a father figure to Natsu who finally returns to the guild after being gone for three years.

  The Actions finally starts After the episode ""Gildarts"". In Episode 77, The guild hall is absorbed into a massive vortex that mysteriously opened in the sky, leaving only a few certain Dragon Slayers, their cats, and a blue haired mystery-man behind. Carla- knowing that the Vortex is a magic absorption portal that was used to suck Magnolia, and the surrounding area dry of magic power, decides to power fly vertically into the portal in order to reach the other side, and rescue their lost friends. Upon reaching the other side of the Portal, The rescuing group is faced with not only a beautiful new world known as ""Edolas"", but a problem. To put it in Carla's Words: ""Magic is a limited resource in this world"". Not only blunt, but true. After flying a few minutes, the band is forced to make tracks to find their friends on foot. With a time limit running short before Their friends are vaporized into magical power, by the tyrannical King of Edolas: Faust, Natsu, Wendy, Carla, and Happy, must find, and bust their friends out of the Lacrima before it's to late! Get ready for some extreme shockers, clones, doctoral Rulers, No magic, and- A WHOLE LOT of cats, In FAIRY TAIL PART 7!

  On a Personal Note, I found the fights are liking in this episode. Actually, There were no actual hits, slashes, freezes, wacky spirits, or people getting blown away by Sky Dragon Roars. Quite the opposite, the Part is quite nonviolent. And on another note, this is a good thing. From watching that episode, I found I was deeply stirred by the drama in it. The whole plot of the small band looking for the friends before time runs out itself is moving. Furthermore, Near the end, I was feeling sorry for even Happy and Carla, and I don't even LIKE the cats that much! (not to say I dislike them). So to sum it up, this episode has ALOT of drama, sad, and ANGERING moments in it. This is good, because from what I understand, Part 8- Which is scheduled to be released February 4, 2014, has some INSANE fights in them! (that means amazing). Simple instances of these fights are find in the title of the episodes! the second episode of part 8 is titled ""Erza Vs. Erza"". What a kickbutt title, and fight that must be! I've listened to the soundtrack ""Erza vs Erza"" On youtube, and that alone gets my pumped for a crazy fight, with sword blows flying everywhere! Part 8 also has the battle of ""The Three Dragon Slayers"" Which pits Wendy, Gaijeel, and Natsu against the Magic- Hungry king of Edolas against Fairy Tail's Dragon Slayers! (Check out the soundtrack ""Sannin no Dragon Slayer"" on Youtube for a hearing of the fight). So, despite the FIght deficiency, I am MORE than contempt with Fairy Tail Part 7. Fights don't mean everything, there is Drama too, and that's why I think Fairy Tail is such an awesome Anime! Check out The Trailer For this Part at  [...]",1385251200,8,4002,4.617440225035161

5971790,5,B00F9F7MKC,"Since Fairy Tale exploded onto the scene in 2009, it has become one of the most popular modern shonen series, even threatening to topple the holy shonen trinity of Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. Now typically I don't like anime like Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece, but I enjoy Fairy Tale quite a bit. The blu ray quality is amazing by the way. Highly recommend.",1380499200,19,360,4.553846153846154

5971814,3,B00F9F7MKC,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!
If you want to watch the series, you should know what you are getting into this season.

The season In my eyes is pretty much a filler that explains happy and carla's background and is a setup for the iron DS to get a cat. In the original release I'm sure this was only part of a season. Ends on a cliffhanger and no real action since most every one can't use their magic. Not really worth the buy compared to the series.",1486598400,,439,4.1647058823529415
