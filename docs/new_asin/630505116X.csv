957157,5,630505116X,Action is fast paced and special effects are excellent.  Has the feel of an Indiana Jones adventure with likeble hero and sidekick.  Well worth the price of the DVD,914284800,,164,4.620689655172414
957158,4,630505116X,"The audio and video portions are a standout, but not much else went into the DVD production of this Hollywood Pictures release under the Disney umbrella. The single layer-disc contains the 2.35:1 widescreen version, but  without anamorphic enhancement. From the static menu are some basic  options, no supplements are included except for a trailer found under the  inappropriately named ""Extra Feature"" category. Talk about your  extra disappointment. Still, that's all fine and dandy if the disc isn't  over priced at $29.99. Unless it is a blockbuster title, I don't find the  incentive to pay for that much. I hope that Disney would follow the example  of Warner in releasing moderate hit titles at under $20. That goes out to  Paramount and Fox releases as well.
I have little complaint when it  comes to the transfer of the DVD. The presentation is smooth and exhibits  none of the jaggedness or shimmering. Images are a tad soft on some scenes,  but detailed with occassional grains. The film is set in a mostly dark  environment; the cruise ship is stranded in a violent storm and most  actions take place below the deck in half-lit corridors. Black and shadow  detail are crucial in such an environment and thankfully the picture  exhibits clearly defined outlines and depths, instead of a muddy mess. In  fact, some of the creature effects have too strong of an outline which  bring attention between the real setting and digital effects. But that is  not something that the transfer could improve on. Colors are well saturated  and the luxurious interior of the ship provides for an absorbing display.
The special effects by Dream Quest and makeup effects by Academy Award  winner Rob Bottin (The Thing, Total Recall) are generally quite impressive  and nothing cheesy like Anaconda. The amount of gores approach that of  Starship Troopers. In one shocking scene, the cargo hold is filled with  human remains of recent victims, minus the skins. I was having a pizza went  that scene came on, let just say it was very hard to swallow afterward. But  five minutes later, I was chomping away. In another gruesome scene, a  partially digested crew reaches for help to the remaining survivors as the  creature's acid slowly dissolves his body. The effect was done by Blur  Studio using computer generated imagery tracked into a live-action shot.  For the climatic finale, the cruise ship Argonautica was blown to pieces.  The pyrotechnics made realistic by actually blowing up a 110-foot model of  the ship.
The encoded Dolby Digital soundtrack is the main event of this  DVD. The violent storm unleashes thunders that are incredibly deep in  reveberation. The seemingly unstoppable creatures would just break through  metal corridors and compartments in pursue of victims. The sound effects of  destructions are powerful and dynamic, actively involving all speakers. The  metal hull and pipes lend to the eerie echoes of creaks and grinds that are  projected throught a large soundstage with precise localization. Bass  extension is a knock-out during the appearing of the big creature and on  the final denotation of the ship. Jerry Goldsmith provides an adequate  score and scary sound cues to get the pulse racing around every  corner.
Deep Rising is a load of mindless fun. A perfect film to watch  when your buddies are coming over and they demand some entertainment from  your home theater setup. The last thing you want to show them is something  like Hope Floats. Even Sandra Bullock wouldn't be able to prevent a mutiny  in your living room then. So relax, rent Deep Rising, have a few drinks,  and everyone will have a good time. That is until you've to clean up the  mess afterward.",911260800,,3699,4.968954248366013

957261,5,630505116X,"Deep Rising is an excellent action-adventure. It fits the genre wherein a monster (or a bunch of them) surfaces from the deepest levels of the ocean to attack a cruise ship, killing and sucking all the fluid from the victims. Just after the feast, the cruise ship is boarded by unsuspecting crooks who plan to rob and scuttle the ship. The crooks have tricked and forced the hero,Treat Williams, to take them to the cruise ship in the middle of the China Sea. The movie has plenty of taut suspense. Treat Williams provides an excellent performance, and offers some wit, to boot.",1489104000,2,578,4.676470588235294

957298,4,630505116X,"Quality wise this is around the same as most B grade monster attacking humans movies.  Things like guns that seem to never run out of ammunition that you often find in these things is again the case here.  It's also a movie where from the start you can predict who is going to be around at the end.  Basically we're on a sabotaged sinking cruise ship over somewhere we're told is so deep that the Himalayas could be hidden in its ocean floor trenches.  So a lot of the attacks have victims splashing around or being pulled into water, so we don't see a lot of it happening but we do see a lot skeletons and aftermath.  We do see the creature as a CGI and it looks all right.  You'll either love or hate the mechanic on the boat Joey (played by Kevin O'Connor) who makes wise cracks while being beat up, running for his life and well throughout the whole film.  For me I thought he made what might have been a duller film a bit more interesting.  Three and a half stars.",1479600000,,969,4.2
957299,1,630505116X,"It's ok for Chinese or Japanese people to speak their own language aloud when complaining or commanding AMERICANS in movies and no one  seems to give a crap but when other races do it they are attacked.  What's up with that AMERICA!  It's was lame.  You don't really see any kills and the monsters attacking are computer generated and reminded me of Hercules and Zena Warrior made for tv shows.  It starts of boring and for the most part stays boring. What I don't get is all the high ratings and not one star for I hate.  It lacked character building, gore, real creatures since everything is CGI and on and on an on. As a hardcore horror fanatic this move kept causing me to fall asleep and I never got to the ending it was just that boring.  To think some folks actually purchased this crap on video made me LOL.
Very disappointing on so many levels.  The action sequences we've seen a million times over.  I would wait for this movie to come out on Prime free or Netflix. Certainly not worth the ticket. PASS-PASS-PASS.",1479600000,,1023,4.427807486631016

957562,5,630505116X,"It's a monster movie.  I adore monster movies.  Yes, it was universally disliked and panned by most critics who felt that it was too much like other films of its type.  I don't consider that a bad thing.  I look for specific elements that are inherent in most monster movies, the most important being the monster.  This one, when seen in all its glory, is a doozy.  As for the rest of the requirements, you need an interesting premise (trap a group of people on a cruise liner with said monster).  Having a prime villain (or two) is a must (in this case Wes Studi and his thugs plus a duplicitous ship owner, Anthony Heald).  Also important is having a damsel in distress, if you've got one, if not, a sneak thief will do (Famke Janssen).  The obligatory hero with an attitude and some wisecracks is also a must (they hired Treat Williams, although they wanted Harrison Ford instead but he turned down the role.  They downsized the film's budget as a result).  Add a lot of weapons, chase scenes, and a healthy body count.  If any or all of that is present, I'm happy.  In this case, everything is present and accounted for.  Is it the best monster movie ever made?  No.  But it will do nicely just the same.  (Love the ending.)",1425254400,,1228,4.410714285714286

957764,1,630505116X,"Remember when ""Alien"" and ""The Abyss"" spawned a bunch of cheap knockoffs, where monstrous creatures would come from deep below the sea?

Well, ""Deep Rising"" is perhaps the most insidiously wretched of that breed -- a witless, worthless puddle of bilgewater that snatches the worst traits of ""Alien,"" ""Anaconda"" and ""Tremors."" To cover up its grotesque deficiencies, Stephen Sommers pelts the audience with guns and gore aplenty, but it's not enough to make you ignore the paper-thin characters and massive plot holes.

Captain John Finnegan (Treat Williams) and his boat have been hired to transport mercenaries and torpedoes to an unknown location. Apparently he asks no questions, even if his engineer Joey (Kevin J. O'Connor) is almost beaten to death by the mercs, and then they hijack his boat. Great approach.

The mercenaries' target: the brand-new luxury cruise liner Argonautica. But when they arrive at the ship, they find it deserted -- everything has been trashed and the people are mysteriously missing. The only ones who have survived are the ship's owner Simon Canton (Anthony Heald), Captain Atherton (Derrick O'Connor) and a professional thief, Trillian (Famke Jansson).

It takes several scenes for the survivors to actually reveal what happened: almost everyone was devoured by vast tentacle-worms that have, for no explained reason, decided to come to the surface and attack a random cruise liner. And even though they've devoured almost everybody on the ship, they are still hanging around to devour the small number of remaining people.

""Deep Rising"" is one of those movies that responds to EVERYTHING with guns -- when they aren't blasting away at random with guns (oh no! A roulette wheel! SHOOT IT!), the characters are sticking guns in each other's faces for no real reason. It's as though Sommers is desperately hoping that nobody will notice how stupid his movie is, as long as he pelts viewers with graphic gore and gunfire.

Unfortunately, the plot is a moronic mishmash of much better movies. You have the implausible serpentine kills of ""Anaconda,"" the claustrophobic ship environment of ""Alien,"" and the sound-sensitive worm monsters that tunnel straight through solid objects from ""Tremors."" Sadly, it has none of the logic or suspense of any of those movies, and mostly consists of idiots bumbling around in a half-flooded ship, doing absurd things in the name of the plot. For instance, even though the worms are unable to locate anyone or anything that isn't making noise... nobody ever stays quiet. They run around shooting and screaming, rather than hiding in complete silence.

And there are massive plot holes generated by unanswered questions. For instance: why are these worms even ON the surface? How did they manage to squeeze into the plumbing? And how do giant tentacle-worms with NO EYES manage to navigate nimbly and silently, rather than banging into things?

The characters don't help much, since they are so two-dimensional that they could be used as playing cards. Finnegan is a mercenary idiot who is shocked that never asking questions of a gang of nasty violent men MIGHT be a bad idea, O'Connor is obnoxiously annoying (even his voice is irritating), and all the mercs -- including Wes Studi and Djimon Hounsou -- are cartoonishly villainous and stupid. Only Famke Jansson's no-nonsense lady-thief is actually likable, and she STILL doesn't have any depth.

""Deep Rising"" almost evokes feelings of nostalgia for movies like ""DeepStar Six"" and ""Leviathan"" -- a painfully obnoxious, lifeless movie that fails to even be hilariously bad. Sink this one into the sea.",1370563200,3,3620,5.163822525597269

957819,5,630505116X,"Throw in a bunch of over-acted robbers with some semi-hostages on a ship with an infestation of crazy sea worms (I forgot what they were called so I am calling them sea worms), and you get Deep Rising, which is, dare I say it.... my 2nd favorite Big Budget B-Movie-Like Creature Feature next to Piranha 3D which is in 1st place and The Blob `88 which takes 3rd place!

Plot: It's simple yet cool! A group of robbers attempt to hijack a stationed cruise ship, sounds easy enough right, I beg to differ since all the inhabitance of this yacht is gone, well besides six, *bang, bang, bang* I mean three characters (The greedy owner of the ship, the captain, and a lovely woman with a mean streak), Now that the characters are all in place, unleash the sea worms and let the carnage begin, and when it begins, I'm not going to lie.... it's pretty grisly!

Review: You would think this movie would capsize over it's weighted down characters and plot but nope, because these characters are basically characters from every epic yet over acted action movie *cough* deadly prey *cough* and it seems their soul purpose isn't robbing the place, loving guns, or even fighting the sea worms, it's more so that they are there to die by the worms and have a few good characters survive! I really didn't have a problem with the special effects, they were much better than Anaconda 1-4s, Deep Blue Seas, and Lake Placid 1-4s! They also didn't just take any ordinary Animal; it was Like Tremors on steroids in the ocean, Tremors had great animatronics with no CGI, you can't say that about Deep Rising for only one soul purpose, there was no animatronics, just pretty epic CGI. The film overall is very entertaining and the two problems I had with it was that I wish we could've seen the massacre but that leads to my other problem, it was a pretty long movie, but it was awesome non the less. The Director (Stephan Sommers) really shows how he wants the humor to balance with the horrors that definitely shows just as much in The Mummy 1 & 2 and Van Helsing! This Movie was awesome and even though it was long I still wanted more at the end, I really wanted a sequel with the same surviving cast and the same director, but no such luck has happened!

Acting: It's like Aliens meets Deadly Prey meets Tremors. It had witty one liners, a great try-to-calm-down story to make some extra time go by, and funny, seriously funny, and dead funny characters who you take seriously at first but then laugh with at the end! I especially liked the part when the main robber guy disallowed Treat Williams the gun but then he saw what was coming and he practically kicked it up into his arms. It was a fun time with lots of likable characters!

Gore: lots of grisly dead bodies, a mangled living corpse, a broken leg, some people get the blood sucked right out of them, hell, there is even an infamous scene where a woman is sucked right down the toilet and blood sprays everywhere... This film is definitely disgusting in quite a few scenes!

Bottom Line: One of the best late 90's creature features, it is a shame I never grew up watching it, instead it was Deep Blue Sea, Lake Placid, and Anaconda that I grew up watching for late 90's movies! This film is a gem and it even has a somewhat 80's vibe to it.... all in all this film is spectacular fun!

Rated R for sci-fi violence and gore
(Which is weird because there if a fair amount of f-bombs and other profanities in it and there is no ""language"" in the rating!?!)

They come upon a massive cruise ship which was really their destination but it is dead in the water.

The mercenaries' intent was to help rob the ship and sink it.  Meanwhile the boat that they are on is damaged as it hits another smaller boat that has fallen off of the cruise ship.  Now their escape boat is in need of repair before they can even leave.  The mercenaries are loaded with the most advanced mini Gatling machine guns and they even have a torpedo.  They board the cruise ship and find almost all of the passengers have disappeared and the ship is infested by some creatures or one creature that is apparently eating everyone on board....

This is a monster movie that is full of action and it is actually pretty good.  It also has humor in it and at times it is quite funny.  This movie really never takes itself seriously and as a result it is just fun to watch as entertainment.  There are some great one liners in this film that are just hilarious.  I really enjoyed this movie years ago when I purchased the DVD but the ending leaves you hanging.  It is almost like there is a monster movie to follow but one was never released.

957869,5,630505116X,"One of my all-time favorites. Believe me, I'm no fan of horror/terror flicks, not in the least. But when it's blended with comedy, you won't find a more appreciative fan. Movies like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0018OIK0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>', '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-II/dp/B0053TWVA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House II</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>' are multiple-plays for me.

And 'Deep Rising' is tops on that list, with just the right blend of hyper-kinetic action, sharp comedy and vicious monsterfest - all rolled into one powerhouse blast.

This was the first time I actually saw a different side to Treat Williams. My only other exposure to his career were in a ridiculous 1970's musical and the ber-classic Sergio Leone film 'Once Upon A Time In America', neither of which were memorable or particularly interesting from his character's perspective. Had absolutely no idea the guy could be so funny or believable as an action star. And as ocean transporter Finnegan, he mastered that ever-so-difficult comic skill: Deadpan Timing. How many actors work that in as a script 'must have' and then completely blow it? Lots. So it's appreciated even more when done right.

However, this might be attributed to hit-n-miss director Stephen Sommers, who seems to have the uncanny ability to make movie magic with modest budgets and second-tier actors, but then he'll turn around and lay a doo-doo bomb when given carte blanch. Appears to be one of those creators that works best under extreme constraints, forcing creativity to fill-in the gaps where funding falls short. Some filmmakers, particularly from the independent/guerilla school, just can't transition to a big budget project - that's a fact. I'm hoping his upcoming reboot of 'When Worlds Collide' falls into the former Sommers category and not the latter. It's literally one of the preeminent Sci-Fi classics, a touchstone film. And for anyone trying to reinvent the wheel, has the term 'career-damaging' written all over it.

Honestly, after all the different performances I've seen both on the small and big screens, this is Famke Janssen's sexiest, most endearing characters. She's so delectable as Trillian - the perfect combination of smart thief and sexy chick. You almost wish someone had recognized the potential and produced a film just for her character. That red dress, that crooked smile - yum. In 1998 she was female perfection defined.

And was there ever a more perfect film weasel than when played by Kevin J. O'Connor? Nope. And that's why he's so freakin' hilarious. And as much as I dislike typecasting actors, you have to admit, it's a solid career maker for some. That shrill nasal voice gets me every time - in every role. I literally cannot see the man without busting a gut. (laughing)

Then there's the merc team. What a lot! You couldn't make up a better crew of hardcore contractors than this - impossible. Led by the incredible Wes Studi, whom I never tire of. And like Williams, I had no idea the man could be so damn funny! He needs more work - period. Love him in every role I've seen him, be it character or lead, small or big screen. A stupendous top-shelf actor whose mere presence elevates a film's status by one full grade.

The remainder, in my mind, will always be The Standard when it comes to pay-for-play gunslingers: Jayson Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, Djimon Hounsou, Clifton Powell, Clint Curtis and the much missed Trevor Goddard. Man, I truly miss that Aussie. Fantastic action stud whose star was on the rise when personal issues took their toll. Even my young nieces were confused that one of their favorite pirates was missing in the subsequent Disney 'Pirate' movies. Broke my heart to tell them that he had passed away and 'The Curse Of The Black Pearl' would be his only appearance. So sad.

A favorite that hasn't lost any edge over the years. If you enjoy this kind of monster-comedy-thriller, then this is definitely your movie.",1322870400,,4203,5.396341463414634

A lot of those kind of movies from that era lack creativity and originality in a big way. This movie really has nothing to offer rather than a big caboom a very digitalized and cheesy looking monster; and a boring cast. Hard to believe there is an actor in this movie that made an appearence in last of the mohegans.,1288051200,,482,4.3076923076923075

957897,3,630505116X,"The Pluses:

The acting by the leads is good.  I love horror films in which a small group of people are brought together and required to overcome their differences for the sake of mutual survival in a scary and hostile environment, usually one that they are trapped in for awhile.  Also, nice if they are heavily armed so we can see alot of gunfire during their battle for survival.

The Negatives:

This film is a bit too long.  I think trimming a half hour off of it would have helped.

Also, this is one of those early films that relied too heavily on obvious CGI monsters (obvious because the lighting on them does not quite match their environment) that briefly pop up at unexpected moments.  Basically there is just a jumble of CGI tentacles coming through pipes and walls and doors through most of the film.  Finally, at the end of this overlong film one gets to see THE monster which is some sort of giant man eating octopus...I think.  If they had just used a few actors in rubber octopus suits that attached and ate expendable cast members who had occasionally wondered off by themselves, then that would probably have been MORE effective!

Overall:

Yeah, I would still recommend this film to the sci-fi / horror film fan just for the excellent acting by the leads and the claustrophobic environment of the ship they are all stuck on.  The explosions look good, too.  But, be prepared, because I think you will find the giant sea monster a bit of a disappointment.",1276041600,,1475,4.580152671755725

To me, the critics don't know squat about good movies-of any genre.
I'm no expert on movies, but usually, I judge movies on my own criteria-story, direction, cast, special f/x, music, basically, I analyze every part before trashing it, it appears most people here do the same, as they should.
My opinion on this movie is it's well acted, good story, although somewhat cheezy, but that was probably the idea, the f/x were convincing enough for me, plus the charecters are hardly wooden-the bad guys are easy to hate, Treat Williams and Famke Jennsen are easy to like, even though she started off bad, Anthony Heald, whom you may remember as Dr. Chilton from Silence of the Lambs once again plays his role to the helm. Director Stephen Sommers, famous now for combining action, horror, adventure, and humor-was very successful with the elements here, as he normally is, plus I also liked the Mummy films-by him, I also don't really see those as remakes of the classics, admittedly though I haven't seen those, so I can't judge them either way.

957901,1,630505116X,"If you are a fan of those ""Sci-Fi Channel Original"" films, then you may really like ""Deep Rising"". It plays out like a bigger budget version of Sci-Fi standards like ""Mega Snake"", ""Kaw"", ""Fangs"" or ""Ice Spiders"". The film is done by Stephen Sommers made famous for the recent ""Mummy"" movies, and you can see several seeds planted in ""Deep Rising"" that grew into fruition with the ""Mummy"" films. The comic hero, played by Treat Williams, the goofy sidekick ""Tooch"", the touge but lovable heroine played by Famke Janssen, the over-the-top villains straight off the set from the latest ""Die Hard"", all clicked much better in the first two ""Mummy"" films than they do here.

The basic story is that a group of commando-like robbers want to hi-jack and rob the patrons of a private cruise ship. Unfortunately before the commandos arrive, the cruise ship attracts the attention of ""something"" living on the ocean floor. When the commando-crooks arrive, the ship is basically deserted, and the few remaining survivors inform them that a ""creature"" has devoured most of the ship's passegner and crew.

Simple enough, a decent basis for a monster movie. Unfortunately, things begin to really unwind as soon as we catch a glimpse of the monster. The CGI monster looks as though Hanna Barbera had a hand in it's creation, and the squid from Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" made over 3 decades earlier looks more convincing and threatening than the writhing mass of tentacles found here. The acting is hammy, and over the top, which might have actually worked if everyone played it serious, but for the most part the cast is constantly smirking at how witty the dialogue is supposed to be, and playing up the ""comedy"" which just doesn't work.

Top all of that off with a soundtrack comprised of some guy jamming out on a Casio home keyboard better suited for a Hulk Hogan movie, and this is just a lousy creature feature entry all the way around.",1243382400,3,1941,4.7880597014925375

957925,2,630505116X,"When I first saw `Deep Rising' I was young and foolish and I thought that it was the coolest horror monster adventure movie out there.  Then, recently, I saw it again and had all these awesome memories of what was going to be seen, yet it seemed like a catastrophic failure to me the second time around.  None of the chills were there, the special effects, while decent, were not the crazy eye-poppers I remembered.  The acting was stiff (on most accounts at least) and the script was dreadful.  It was as if I was watching a completely different movie than the one I remembered with such fondness.

The film follows a group of hijackers who bust into a luxury ocean liner expecting to strip it of its valuables only to uncover that only a handful of passengers are still alive and the ship is infested with these tentacle looking monster things that are draining the life out of the humans on board.  Armed with some heavy artillery the surviving men and woman (a con artist who happened to survive through a stroke of circumstantial luck) decide to take on the beast in order to escape.

The problems with `Deep Rising' lay in Sommers' hands.  He wrote and directed this debacle.  There is absolutely no originality to be found within the film, at all, and that is disappointing because it could have been really interesting and or exciting.  Instead it comes off rather boring and predictable.  The acting is atrocious on most fronts (Treat Williams actually turns out a decent performance and Famke Janssen tries to save her character from inevitable clichs) which is mostly chock up to the horrendous script and dialog they are given to work with.  I know that a film in this genre is filled to the brim with one-liners (which I'm never really fond of) but these ones rarely land right.

In the end `Deep Rising' comes off as a stupid, mildly entertaining distraction from better more fulfilling films.  Sure, there is some excitement value here but really, why bother?  There are many films that have more going for them; films that are original and exciting and entertaining.  `Deep Rising' just doesn't stack up, it doesn't offer the audience enough of anything to sustain them or warrant their adoration.  I understand that not every movie has to be award worthy or of such prestige caliber, but every movie should at least deliver the best it can, and `Deep Rising' is far from the best of its breed.",1219363200,,2410,4.672985781990521

There are a few inexpensive special effects created with care (the ocean liner model that gets blown up, the computer graphic tentacle monster).

You may not be particularly impressed with the impossible story, but you keep watching because anyway it keeps entertaining in its own way. It is not the greatest horror film in the movie history, but is not the worst either. Director is Stephen Sommers, the guy responsible for much better ""The Mummy.""

Treat Williams is an adventurer hired by the group of the pirates led by Wes Studi. Their target is a luxury ocean liner which is just attacked by a man-eating creature(s?) with huge tentacles. It is a typical B-movie premise (though the effects are superb), but it is fun nonetheless. Listen to Treat William's character repeatedly say with a self-mocking tone ""Now what?"" and we all know that we are not supposed to take the film seriously.

""Deep Rising"" understands the rules of monster flicks: they need beautiful ladies and some occasional comic touch if possible. Famke Janssen is the beauty and Kevin J. O'Connor provides laughs. The film also includes the supports like Djimon Hounsou, Jason Flemyng and Cliff Curtis, but don't expect character development or something like that. You just don't have one - the good is always good while the bad is always bad - and all that is intentional.

The cast is great and the special effects aren't bad. So all-in-all it has most of what the previous movies I mentioned have. Maybe not quite as good as them, but certainly not bad at all. I recommend you catch this one if you like the movies I mentioned.

The plot of modern day sea pirates hi-jacking a luxury cruise liner is rather interesting as this actually has happened. More so today than when the movie was made, but currently sea pirates are actually becoming a real problem again. In this stories case the pirates find a empty ship, well except for a few hungry sea monsters. Far-fetched? You bet, and I like it.

957932,3,630505116X,"I would second everything the other reviewers have said about this film being a lot of fun and excitement. It involves a boat for hire captain (Treat Williams) that takes his crew and guests into trouble in the ocean. Turns out his guests are pirates and the thing they paid him to do is take them to an ocean going cruise ship, so they can rob its guests.

Little do they know that ship has been invaded by a sea monster or two or 10! The monster(s) is (are -- I could never tell if there was 1 or 100) a computer creature that is quite bizarre and unique. Its idea was probably based in the octopus but it goes way beyond that.

The thing(s) ends up killing a lot of folks and setting off a lot of explosins. It (they) puts everyone into a situation where the last remaining good guys have to escape the ship that is blowing up on a Ski-doo.

The special effects are probably the star of this film, which is routine in terms of its script, sets and acting. There is plenty of violence but little that is egregious by 2006 standards. Look for a funny twist at the end!

I'd say this is one of the more entertaining movies I've seen recently. It kept me involved all the way through, something I can't say about a lot of big budget Hollywood blockbusters I see. If you like action or adventure flicks, you'll enjoy this one.",1151280000,3,1324,4.242063492063492
957981,5,630505116X,"To me Deep Rising reminds me of films such as  The Mummy, with everything under water crossed with Jurassic Park style creature chasing its lunch, I mean the ship crew around. I have watched it a few times all ready and this is the kind of a movie that only gets better with every viewing.

What is great about Deep Rising is the consistency with strong deliverance of plot and action. There are no dull moments and people die in some surprising deaths and you really don't know who is going to make it, since no one looks safe. I mean how many movies start of with a whole cruise ship crew vanishing in the middle of the ocean?

Yes this movie is a few years old and the special creature effects are computer generated in most parts but it was really a blast to watch and to laugh at some clever jokes.

Treat Williams looks like a space commander in his ship playing the small boat captain, John Finnegan with goofy sidekick Kevin J. O'Connor as Joey ""Tooch' Pantucci (who also appeared in The Mummy - you just cant miss his squeaky voice) on board with fabulous Famke Janssen who plays a jewel thief along with some darkly clad characters on a secret mission with a lot of guns. We also have Djimon Hounsou who's pretty ruthless and unfriendly, Cliff Curtis who usually plays some South American drug lord who is pretty funny in this one and Wes Studi as the bad guys team captain.

What is really entertaining is watching all the opposing characters try and work together to abandon the cruse ship in one piece and let me tell you, the two hours go fast and the guys get eaten even faster. The story is beyond trying to outsmart a creature that ate everyone on  the ship and gets behind the story line to how it all came to happen, for there is a reason.

We once called these movies B-science fiction movies, though that terminology is somewhat out of style.  Regardless, this movie is an excellent B-movie that is a lot of fun to watch.

This movie does not take the easy way out by having a nice simple plot.  The plot starts simple enough, but then gets very complicated.  Fortunately, the giant carnivorous priapulid worms that the actors encounter manage to solve much of the complexity.

The movie begins with a nice simple attack on a cruise ship.  The ship's owner is having a little money problems and decides the easy way out is to have the ship sunk, which then allows him to get the insurance money.  However, when the hired mercenaries board the ship they are unable to find anyone, and they keep hearing strange noises.  Then mercenaries start disappearing into the water pouring into the ship's bowels.

Interlude time:  While we are waiting to get a clear view of whatever is running around making people disappear we meet a burglar, Trillian St. James (Famke Janssen) and we learn more about the captain of the ship carrying the mercenaries, John Finnegan (who was clueless about why he was hired), well played by Treat Williams.  We also meet a number of mercenaries, albeit briefly in many cases, and finally encounter the captain of the cruise ship and the owner.  Of course, they are all blathering about something wandering about the ship and eating people, but we know better.  Right?

Okay, after finding that there are people on the ship after all, just not as many as the mercenaries initially thought, they finally meet their first priapulid worm.  Of course, the meeting does not go well for the worm (the mercenaries are well armed) or the mercenaries (the worms are well-teethed), and things begin to spiral out of control from there.  Everyone finally gets the bright idea that they should forget about stealing and robbing and sinking the ship and just getting off the ship and away from the ship.  Unfortunately for the people on the ship, the worms have other ideas that involve pulling people into their gut and digesting them alive.

The remainder of the movie is a cat and mouse, or worm and man, game.  You must not think that these worms are your typical earth-type worms.  These worms move like extremely fast, flexible and slimy snakes.  These worms have nasty mouths and can suck you into their gut quicker than you can say ""Look out!"" or ""AAHHH!""  The worm then slowly digests the victim.  In once scene the mercenaries and sundry others manage to remove a victim from a worm.  It turns out that was not such a good idea (I will not attempt to describe that particular scene).

I was afraid that this movie was going to turn into a cheese fest.  However, it turned out to be surprisingly good.  The worms were clearly CGI, but they still looked very good.  There are scenes where the worms interact with their surroundings, and those scenes are uniformly excellent.  The scenes may not be believable, but they are well done.  The mercenaries and the worms are well-matched, and I thought there was never a certainty in the outcome.

If you can believe that worms that are usually no more than six inches or so in length can somehow be many feet long, and can move about as fast as a running man, and if you like Treat Williams or Famke Janssen, this movie is a popcorn munching treat.  However, you may want to put away the popcorn when that guy pops out of the worm; that scene is really gross.",1124841600,5,3717,4.695517774343122

A deep-sea crew coincidentally stumbles upon an abandoned underwater vessel and is then ripped from limb to limb by a huge, flesh-eating monster.  Sound familiar?  The original ""Alien"" formula has been beaten to death for over twenty-five years, but directors such as Stephen Sommers and screenwriters like...Stephen Sommers (hmmm...) seem to believe that something new can come from the same old outdated, overused, and underperformed formula.  Treat Williams stars as the head of a group of modern day, underwater pirates who accidentally lurch upon a vacant luxury liner in the South Seas while searching for some goods to steal.  What they find instead is much more than what they bargained for.

The sensual Famke Jannsen stars as a thief and con artist also aboard the ship, but even her flare cannot save ""Deep Rising"" from sinking.  Director/writer Sommers attempts to add some humor (especially with the highly talented Williams), but this attempt falls overboard.  The special effects are only halfway believable, the acting is atrocious, and the script is laughable, all the while using every clich in the book.  A complete waste of nearly two hours.

Yes - it's unoriginal and reminiscent of other movies.  Yes - it seems to alternate too much between being serious and being campy.  Yes - I think that Kevin J. O'Connor is one of the major liabilities of the film.  His comic relief and grating, nasal voice have a fingernails-on-the-blackboard sort of aggravation factor.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I think that ""Deep Rising"" is fun for anybody who enjoys this kind of thing and doesn't demand a whole lot out of their entertainment.  It's very slick, sometimes actually fairly suspenseful, and incredibly gory.  The creature itself is not as impressive; it is entirely animated and looks cheesy - and when you finally see it in all of its true gruesome glory, you may be unimpressed as I was - it does not represent veteran effects master Rob Bottin's best work.

Cast is variable - Treat Williams is not someone you might think of a lead for this kind of film, but it IS essentially a B-movie with an A-level budget, and much of Williams' work over the last several years HAS been of the B-movie variety.  Famke Janssen is sexy and reasonably appealing, and Anthony Heald, Jason Flemyng, Wes Studi and Djimon Hounsou play good slimeballs.

Overall, I genuinely enjoy the movie - I would give it four out of five, but the DVD, made by one of several companies that seem to have no respect for their older features, is sorely lacking in extras, getting just a fair two out of five.

With Finnegan's ship disabled from running into a stray lifeboat, they all board the cruise liner, meet up with Trillian, and one by one fall victim Mr. Squid.  Very action packed, rapidly moving, gorily fascinating splatter fest that is a five star must see.  Especially when Mr. Squid vomits out the half digested guy who is still alive, one of my all time favorite horror movie scenes.
There are crunching skulls, folding metal, bursting pipes, rapid gunfire, and some pretty funny dialogue that manages to not sound out of place like so many flat one liners in horror films.  All of the messy, gory, bloody lower levels of the ship, bending and peeling metal, various and sundry body parts, combine to announce the arrival of the squid-like monster with immense strength and an appetite to match.  All in all, a wonderful journey with a surprise, funny ending.  Enjoy!",1069718400,5,1825,4.75
958032,3,630505116X,"I absolutely love Action God Stephen Sommers' wild little beast of a movie ""Deep Rising"" with all my heart, because 1) it entertains me monstrously and never fails to get me out of a black depressed funk and 2) it reminds me of all those gorily juicy, full-blooded, red meat horror films they used to make back in the eighties---except this bloody little romp was cranked out in 1998!
That said, get your sea legs, load the double-barrel shotgun, and let's venture into the hold of this derelict. Is ""Deep Rising"" worth a look? Well let me ask you a few questions:
Do you like the idea of lots of bloodshed, wanton carnage, and wholesale slaughter?
Do you like the prospect of watching the gorgeous (and water-logged) Famke Janssen clamber around a derelict ocean-liner for nearly two hours?
Do you like movies about voracious, wicked sea-beasties that eat first and ask questions later?
Do you like seeing movies in which Evil Cowardly Villains get their just desserts in exactly the fashion they deserve, screaming and mewling in pain and horror?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to buzz around a luxury ocean liner on a ski-doo?
If you answered ""yes"" to even one of the questions above, then ""Deep Rising"" is for you. Sommers is the Leonardo da Vinci of the Action Film, and he keeps the pace taut, the dialogue crisp, the blood flowing like cheap Merlot, and the bodycount rising into the double digits! Best of all, you get the sadly underrated Treat Williams as the gruff and mercenary boat-captain-with-a-heart-of-gold (he'd be wearing a fedora and wielding a whip if Sommers thought he could get away with it)
unwittingly transporting a gaggle of terrorists to a cruise-liner for pillage and plunder.
Plot? You want plot? Fine. The terrorists are after loot hidden away on a luxury cruise liner on its maiden voyage, a liner owned by a greedy shipping tycoon played by Anthony Heald. Fun stuff!
A downside to this Pleasure Ship of Death? The CGI graphics, which nearly undo the movie's creepy, ghoulish, uber-gory vibe: the creature itself looks atrocious and has far too much freedom of movement to be truly scary. Sommers should have recognized that with a film of this type, less is more, and stuck with prosthetics.
But I'm quibbling. ""Deep Rising"" is a perfect little horror flick and just what the doctor ordered if you're in the mood for hungry undersea beasties, gore galore, amoral and greedy villains, and a healthy selection of panicked victims-to-be, to say nothing of the best axe-killing scene this side of ""The Shining.""

958033,3,630505116X,"Jeff Shannon can't say it any better about writer/director Stephen Sommers than he does in his review, but you've got to admit that the director of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns sure does know how to entertain.  Deep Rising doesn't aspire to be anything special, and it certainly isn't, but thanks to the solid (if underachieving) cast and gruesome special effects, Deep Rising manages to be better than most of the slew of derivative Aliens knock offs that it is associated to.  Treat Williams plays the typical hero role as he and his group of mercenaries arrive on an ocean liner to find most of the crew slaughtered by a huge leviathan like creature with a taste for blood and guts.  The special effects are nicely done for the most part, but the film's biggest flaw is that it is entirely too predictable.  The rest of the cast includes the gorgeous Famke Janssen (X-Men), Kevin J. O'Conner (The Mummy), Anthony Heald (Silence of the Lambs), Cliff Curtis (Training Day), Djimon Hounsou (Amistad), and the late Trevor Goddard (Pirates of the Caribbean).

958037,2,630505116X,"Stephen Sommer knows how to make a dumb b-movie. His career has been full of them. His early movies were mainly family entertainment, but for his first R-rated feature he delivers a monster movie on a cruise ship that could have been spectacular, but isn't.

The story has boat-for-hire Captain Treat Williams (imagine Colin Farrell's dad) drive a bunch of mercenary goons out to a rendezvous with the Argonautica luxury ship in the South China Sea. The goons plan to loot the ship and sink it, but when they hop aboard they find it abandoned with all lifeboats intact. The presence of blood and undigested skeletons doesn't alert them to the fact that a hungry sea monster has taken over.

What disappoints the most about Deep Rising is that ALL of the creature and gore effects are in late-90s quality CGI. Why even hire Rob Bottin, known for his stunning effects on The Thing, RoboCop, and Total Recall, to create the monster if you're not even going to feature a single practical effects shot? The fact that Dreamquest Images and Industrial Light and Magic handled the CGI really surprises me as they are not that good, even by 1998 standards.

It is made watchable by a few decent kills, a macabre attitude, an above average Jerry Goldsmith score, and the presence of the beautiful Famke Janssen (who is full of yum, yum, yum). Though the dialogue is repetitive, some of the goons are woefully miscast (especially Jason Flemyng), and almost every scene takes place in 'flooded grey room with pipes'.

Deep Rising is enjoyable trash for a night of non-cerebral movie-watching and nothing more.

In ""Deep Rising"", a hilariously cheesy, surprisingly effective action thriller, Williams plays John Finnegan, a freelance speedboat operator with a devil may care attitude.  He won't ask questions about his charters, which is how he finds himself and his crew, consisting of Kevin J. O'Conner as the comic relief mechanic and Una Damon as his plucky, soon-to-be eaten co-pilot, carrying a rogues gallery of mercenaries to an unknown spot in the South China Sea.  The merc's goal: Hijack the most fantasteristific ocean liner and take a whole lot of money from the ultra-rich passengers.
Throwing a wrench into the plan is a gigantic sea creature which decides to invade the ship before they get there and eats everybody onboard.  No, I swear, that's what happens.  What follows is basically an ""Alien"" [copy]with a good sense of it's own inherent badness.  Famke Jansen joins the gang as a jewel thief who survives the inital sea monster attack.

958068,5,630505116X,"The legacy of A-list films like Aliens have led to B-movies of this sort (action-horrors) having several basic requirements: an assortment of deliberately overblown characters; a brooding, highly-stylised setting; a monster that has adapted to that setting so that they have a strategic advantage over the humans; inventive and memorable death sequences as the central group is reduced in number one by one; a secondary problem to overcome that is usually time-based; an invincible hero who faces everything with the same witty calm and oozes cool; and huge, beautiful guns that fire a thousand rounds a minute. Deep Rising embraces every one of these critieria, and then some.
Every dial in this film has been cranked up to the max. The action comes thick and heavy, the plot sears along at a blistering pace, the dialogue sparkles, the character dynamics spin back and forth - every single scene has several things happening concurrently. There is nothing extraneous to the simple pleasure of taking the spectator on a thrill-ride that involves hairbreadth escapes, intricate possibilities for romantic liaisons, and an ever-present possibility of an over-the-top, cheer-inducing death. Obviously, this is not a serious film. It is not high-art and nor will it probably ever be mentioned in a book on film theory, but in terms of sheer enjoyment, it gives the majority of big-budget action blockbusters a run for their money. The writer, director, cinematographers, actors and producers certainly know what appeals to their audience and how best to target them - there is nothing in this film that is not `cool'. From Treat Williams' joystick-operated boat to the tomb-like interiors of the ship, from the costumes to the dialogue and set-pieces, from the weaponry to the monsters themselves, everything has been calculated to garner the most enjoyable reaction. Everybody gets their just desserts in incredibly imaginative and memorable ways, the truly unique CGI monsters blur the boundaries between reality and animation, and the big guns that dish out the retribution are simply awesome.
A movie that caters directly to your interests and expectations for a film is certainly something that is going to be a success, and Deep Rising is this on every level - cool, fast-moving, high-octane, huge-scale entertainment. It doesn't fall into the trap of most of these films - killing off too many people too quickly or not quickly enough - and lets it all pan out a satisfying and thrilling pace. And it's great to see X-Men's Famke Jansson and Gladiator's Djimon Hounsou in early roles that will probably be expunged from the CV at any future awards ceremonies. Watch it and enjoy!",1018569600,3,2683,5.14187643020595
958099,5,630505116X,"Don't be afraid to admit that you like this movie.  Deep Rising is a terrific monster flick that delivers all that can be expected of a film of this type.  You get thrills, chills, kills and more than a few laughs.  The computer generated creature from the depths, is an ugly and vicious man-eater, that manifests itself in several different forms throughout the film.  A twisting shiny gray mass, with numerous slimy looking tentacles, capable of great speed.  This terror from the deep devours its victims with zest.  All in all, a very cool looking monster, and a formidable opponent.
The human cast is not bad either.  Treat Williams as ""Finnegan"" is a steady, likeable leading man, delivering some incredibly silly lines with an engaging smirk on his face.  Pickpocket Famke Janssen, is dynamite in a red dress, and handles a gun like a pro.  Comic relief is provided by Kevin J. O'Connor as ""Joey"", a character you will either love or hate.  Anthony Heald as ""Canton"" the pompous ships owner, provides the ""weasel factor"".  The hard-boiled mercenary group, led by ""Hanover""(Wes Studi), ably performs their most critical function, that of being bloody fodder for the monster.
The plot enfolds in time tested fashion.  Finnegan is hired to take a group of mercenaries to an unknown location at sea.  They rendezvous with the ""Argonautica"" a disabled cruise ship, expecting to find it filled with passengers, only to discover just a handful of survivors.  A mysterious creature is apparently loose on board.  As the survivors continue to investigate the crippled ship, the monster makes its presence felt, and the fun begins.  The body count continues to rise, and blood flows freely, up until the film's climax, where the monster pursues a jet ski through the ship's corridors.  Wild mindless fun.
Writer and director Steven Sommers took the experiences gained from his first ""creature feature"", and put them to good use in his next films, the more commercially successful ""The Mummy"", ""The Mummy Returns"" and the yet to be released ""Scorpion King"".
Deep Rising is a great choice for pure escapist enjoyment.  Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack also adds considerably to the atmosphere and excitement.  The DVD features just the movie and the trailer, and is perhaps a good candidate for the ""Special Edition"" treatment common these days, especially as this film has been overshadowed by Sommers latter efforts.",1017619200,29,2409,5.053164556962026

3.  The Ocean liner is attacked (losing a small speed boat with the impact) by something that has forcibly stopped and penetrated the vessel.  ""It"" remains unseen as it wreaks havoc and panic...and blood.
4.  The charter plan (to rob the ocean liner) is revealed to Treat and his crew as the Mercs bring the PT boat up to war specs with the installation of new torpedo tubes secretly brought aboard in crates.
5.  Confrontation between Treat and the Mercs in defense of his crew reveals the cool comic hero status of Treat and his sidekick mechanic.
6.  State-of-the-art weaponry (newly designed Chinese-made high-powered mini-gatling guns with 100 round magazines) is distributed among the mercs.  (Oh boy! This is gonna be good).
7.  Treat's crew is disarmed and intimidated into complicity.
8.  The PT Boat runs over the speed boat that fell off the ocean liner and is damaged.  Repair is mandated as the adrift ocean liner is spotted.
9.  Treat's mechanic can repair the damaged parts of his boat in the ocean liner's machine shop, hence their reason to board the ship with the mercs (unarmed of course!).

Famke Janssen (Trillian)  could...well...just stand there, roll her eyes and suck in those dimples and be effective at just about anything.  The characters are what remain at the end of the story, a funtioning team that can survive the unsurvivable with controlled fear, coolness and humor.

958106,4,630505116X,"In 1987, a very peculiar film called ""Extreme Prejudice"" came out.  At first, it was a simple love triangle - two men loved the same girl.  Then it became a good guy/bad guy tale with one of those men being a sheriff and the other a drug kingpin.  THEN, as if that weren't enough, a US special forces team doing some shadow ops shows up, and puts themselves right into the middle.  ""Extreme Prejudice"" wasn't easily definable, but it was enjoyable.  ""Deep Rising"" is a descendant of sorts.
The movie starts off with a band of mercenaries carrying a band of mercenaries to a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, where an inside contact is sabotaging the ship.  It's modern-day piracy, and all is going to plan until....something...happens and when the mercenaries arrive, the entire ship is empty with nary a sign of any life.
That's all in the first 15 minutes.
Directed by Stephen Sommers (of ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"") fame, ""Deep Rising"" is a hodge-podge of different genres, but Sommers manages to pull it off with the same ingredients that made his ""Mummy"" franchise such a success.  The writing is smart and wicked, blending together comedic and suspense elements seamlessly.  The casting is pitch-perfect, with Treat Williams playing the wisecracking protagonist and Kevin O'Connor wonderful as his sidekick Pantucci.  Perhaps even more appealing is the band of pirates, familiar faces all, led by Wes Studi (Last of the Mohicans), and featuring Djimon Hounsou (Amistad), Trevor Goddard (Mortal Kombat), and Jason Flemyng (Snatch) among others.  These are all well-versed character actors who have covered similar territory before, and bring the necessary panache and confidence to their roles.  Jerry Goldsmith gives it all the right tone, with a quirky score that fits to a tee this genre-hopping film.

958129,4,630505116X,"I have to say that this is a quite entertaining piece of filmmaking.  When people go in to this film expecting to see a horror/sci-fi film in the caliber of Alien, then of course they will be dissapointed.  After seeing many of these types of films, I can say that this is a cut above the rest.  I must also digress and disagree with my fellow reviewers by saying that this is a B-grade film, but that's okay.  After all, Re-Animator was a B movie and it was one of the most brilliant horror films ever made.  The things that propel this film above the rest of the junk out there are great things like character development, as well as characters you actually LIKE, a sometimes very involving story, and very skillful directing.  Stephen Sommers no doubt was able to use this film as a stepping point to The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.  While Deep Rising borrows from many films, this can not be looked down upon of as so many films borrow from others that it is common.  It just depends on how you borrow, and Sommers does it in homage instead of in a cheap way which worsens films nowadays.  This is a good film that is the perfect thing to watch if you want to see great action, likable characters, an interesting story, and some pretty good CGI effects.  It is much better than most of what you can find out there, so give it a chance... you'll be delighted and surprised.",989884800,,1377,4.34375

The action in the movie is well paced and exciting, especially the totally unbeleivable, yet thoroughly exhilarting jet ski chase through the belly of the ship at the end of the movie. The dialogue is 100% cheese, but fits the movie perfectly, even the one liners are pure gold. I'm not a big CGI fan, but I liked the fx in the film, the half digested villain is some of the best CGI I've ever seen, even rivaling Episode 1.

958131,3,630505116X,"You don't need a well-developed brain capacity to get the gist of ""Deep Rising,"" but it's not without its perks. The plot is pure contrivance and formula, relying on throwing its characters into situation after situation with little regard for originality or intelligence. But there is suspense to be had with the movie, and this use of non-stop action keeps it moving at a pace that keeps it enjoyable on a level which requires little thought. There is a surprising amount of intensity, but what really sells me on this movie is the witty dialogue from the cast and the nicely-crafted special effects.
The movie opens with two separate stories, one involving a water transport service led by John Finnegan, who is unaware that his passengers are transporting massive firearms to their undisclosed destination. This revelation sparks a takeover of the boat by the gruff passengers, leaving Finnegan and his two crew members, Joey and Leila, at their mercy. As this is happening, the new cruise ship Argonautica is out on its maiden voyage until a mysterious person tampers with the computer mainframe of the vessel and causes the ship to lose any and all control. To complicate matters for the passengers, the ship is brought to a terrifyingly jolting halt, accompanied by spooky noises from outside the ship's hull.
The two stories converge at this point, as Finnegan's vessel arrives at its destination: the disabled cruise ship, at which point everyone but one of the bandits and Leila board the ship. Armed with machine guns and a vast array of weapons, they search the ship from top to bottom, only to discover that the passengers are nowhere in sight, save for the beautiful Trillian St. James, a seductively crafty thief whose attempts to rob the ship take a backseat to staying alive, and the ship's captain, Simon Canton, the pouty whiny jerk of the story.
At this point, things begin to get a little clearer. We learn the secret connection between Canton and the arrival of the gun-laden bandits, while also discovering that the ship has become infested with worm-like creatures with a taste for humans. They don't merely eat humans, but drink them and then rid themselves of the skeletal remain, which will turn more than a few stomachs in the audience. The story segues into a race for survival, as they struggle for a way out of the ship before they are all digested by the creatures.
The story itself is mostly juvenile, and despite its R rating, it is given a pretty basic treatment that most preteens would be able to understand. This is due to its never-ending formulaic plot twists and contrived attention-grabbers that pop up at least once every minute. Scenes which pit the surviving members of the group against the dangerous monsters always leave a way out for them, and it is because of this that we are able to predict so early on who will end up making it off the ship. There seems to be a mantra for the story that if you can't find a way out of a situation, then the most ludicrous scenario you can imagine turns up being the way out. The movie follows this mantra in almost every action sequence, and I found myself heaving an ""Oh, please"" through a good bit of the film.
Writer/director Stephen Sommers shows no apparent shame in borrowing from almost every disaster movie involving a creature or a ship that we've seen done before. There are elements of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" present in a scene that requires our heroes to swim through underwater sections of the ship to reach a safety spot. The composition of the creatures comes dangerously close to copying the ""Anaconda"" craze, and let's not forget to mention how they travel through the ship, which is resonant of ""Alien,"" in which the alien made its way around through air-conditioning vents (here, our creatures use water pipes).
What comes as a surprise to me is the amount of suspense the film totes along with this formula and contrivance. All of those plots twists and attention-grabbers may be old, but they certainly have not lost their touch, and I found myself watching with increased attention and jumping in certain scenes. This movie uses a lot of fast shocks, especially ones accompanied by sudden, shrill chords of music, and these work quite well in delivering shocks and thrills. And those situations where they always find a way out? Well, they may get out, but it's not without the close calls and the heightened rush of adrenaline you get from watching scenes like this. You know they'll make it to safety, but there's always that little area in your mind which questions that fact.
What really makes the movie enjoyable is the way Sommers incorporates humor and witty dialogue into the story to balance out the thrills and shocks. This is becoming increasingly fervent in his films, and was the case with his remake of ""The Mummy."" In the midst of all the intensity and violence, we are still given a chance to laugh at the characters' remarks, mostly from Trillian and Joey. Trillian is played by Famke Janssen, who has such a knack for turning colorful phrases and making them completely convincing (if you don't believe me, watch 1999's ""House on Haunted Hill""). And Kevin J. O'Conner plays Joey, whose subtle timidity and high-pitched voice make him a stand-out for comedy.
Treat Williams plays a good action hero as John Finnegan, and while his character may seem a little too hammy (and maybe a little too insightful as to the connection between the captain and the villians), he plays it well and looks like he's having fun with it. Anthony Heald is our whiny, two-faced antihero as captain Canton, and his segue is well-acted and convincing. The supporting cast also includes Wes Studi, Derrick O'Connor, Jason Flemyng, Cliff Curtis, Clifton Powell, Trevor Goddard, Djimon Hounsou, Una Damon, and Clint Curtis.
Despite its many flaws, ""Deep Rising"" can be a fun and exciting ride that is not without its suspense factor. It does prove, on a mediocre level, that formula and contrivance can sometimes be fun. Wit and humor abide very nicely within this film, which allows us to laugh while jumping in fright at just the right moments.",988070400,2,6150,4.813799621928166
958132,4,630505116X,"Deep Rising has the terrorists and geography of Die Hard,the boat from Titanic, a few of the characters from Star Wars, the soldiers-vs.-monsters action of Aliens, a creature that resembles a mindless Lovecraftian Old One, a horribly gory almost-dead victim stolen from Robocop, and the classic sequence where the bad guy dies a slow, horrible death because he wasted his last bullet trying to kill the good guy.  Ah, the modern morality tale.  Plus a sense of humour which is really what keeps this movie going.  As you may have gathered, this is a formula movie, but it is done gracefully and never slows down or tries to be serious.  At the same time, it never mocks the traditions of the creature feature, treating every cliche and stock scene with exactly the right respect.  (Unlike, for example, Independence Day, which couldn't decide whether it was a major family feature or a B-movie, or the Mummy, which never made its nasties seem nasty enough).  The jokes are funny, the gore is plentiful enough to turn give seasoned stomaches a jolt, the action is well-framed, the music is creepy, and the ending is FABULOUS!!  However, it's not for everyone.  I've seen this a couple of times with mixed crowds, and I've found it to be one of those movies that will make your best friends look down on you forever - unless they are horror fans.

If it weren't for ""Jaws"", I would have said this is the best, most fun sea monster movie ever made, period. I read about it in Fangoria, and the effects looked cool. I have trouble resisting a good monster movie, and I remember reading was that all the cast and crew said they had an absolute blast making the movie. I didn't really expect much, but this flick turned out to be so much fun I ended up buying it.
Treat Williams is Finnegan, a stock type of hero that is a cross between Han Solo and Bruce Campbell (or Bruce Campbell as Ash, I should say). You know, the type of 'scoundrel for hire' who owns his own ship and will get the job done for you for a price, even if it is technically criminal, but is basically a stand-up guy. He and his roughneck gang of mercenaries are hired to hijack and rob a luxury ocean liner on its maiden voyage in the South Seas. When he and his gang, which includes his stock Comic Relief Sidekick, Joey (Kevin J. O'Connor), find out that the rich scumbags who hired them to do the job left out some crucialinfo that make the job even more dangerous, they get cranky (standard dialogue such as ""This wasn't part of the deal, and you know it!"" ensues). However, this turns out to be the least of their friggin' problems, because when they board the ship, they find all the thousands of millionaire passengers have vanished without a trace. The only handful ones left alive are a sexy jewel thief (Famke Jannsen) and the big bosses of the ship. Hmmmmm...guess what happens? This is a monster movie, so...So I know this doesn't sound like much.
While this movie won't win any prizes for making you ponder the meaning of life, it is entertaining. One of those fun, mindless roller coaster movies that won't go down as the most thought provoking movie (you can predict exactly what is going to come out of a character's mouth at any given moment, such as ""Hey..."" ""What?"" (pause)""....Be careful""), but makes you realize how much fun a good dumb monster movie can be. The special effects are inventive and mind-blowing-they don't look low budget at all, and there's a ton of cool FX. Some of them are pretty memorable. The monster seems kind of run-of-the-mill at first, but keeps getting better and nastier. Instead of just eating its victims, it takes agonizing time to digest them before spitting out the gristle and bones, making for such a long painful death that characters save a bullet to kill themselves if the monster gets them, rather than go through the torture.
Without spoiling it,the monster turns out to be much more impressive and frightening (like other great monster movies, you don't see the entire creature in all its 'glory' till the grand finale) than anyone expects.
There's guts, goo, and gore-a-plenty for splatter fans (I was actually surprised that the MPAA let them get away with an R rating). There's many great horrifyingly disgusting moments, and I remember one in particular that occurs about 1/3 into the film that will make the most jaded viewer's jaws drop.
While the dialogue is corny and the characters 1-dimensional, there were actually several twists and turns to the storyline that were a shock, including one of the best and most original ""the end...OR IS IT?"" endings I've ever seen in a horror flick. Treat Williams is kind of a discount Bruce Campbell (man, that bit of casting would have made the movie perfect), but does a fine job even with some of the stupid catchphrases he is given (""NOW what?""). Famke Jannsen looks stunningly beautiful as always and is more talented and charismatic than more people give her credit for. The Sidekick, who does such a great job impersonating Joe Pantoliano (or ""Joey Pants"" as he is called by  the indie film industry) that I had to check the credits, actually gets some funny lines in (Finnegan: ""Do you know how many uncharted islands there are out here?"" Joey: ""Uh, two?"") The supporting cast, even the extras, ham it up and are clearly having lots of fun.
 There are some moments that are pretty frightening and there's plenty of nail biting suspense. While this movie is strongly reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", the ""Alien"" series, and even ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (Star Wars fans, listen to Williams when he raises his voice, he's a dead ringer for Ford as Han Solo) it is also very original. More importantly, this flick is just flat-out fun. If you're in the mood to escape reality completely, scream, and be entertained, then by all means pop in this underrated little gem , turn off your brain, and get ready to have a blast.

Not all the bad touches were successful - the comic relief character was annoying, despite his having an identical voice to Shaggy from Scooby Doo, and there was  something profoundly disturbing about the cloying amounts of wryness Treat  Williams managed to exude.  Apart from that, though, there are few things  to complain about.

I was especially impressed by the way the  filmmakers combined the most successful elements of Alien 2 (heavily-armed  nutcases running around a compound being massacred by hideous monsters)  with the least successful elements of Alien 3 (British actors constantly  shouting ridiculous lines).  Most notable in this respect was Jason  Flemyng, the ginger thesp of Lock, Stock... fame.  His delivery of such  lines as 'It's like they've all just... vanished', 'You killed him didn't  you' and - best of all - 'Eat this, you wankers!' was a high point of my  moviegoing life, and I was sorry to see him eaten (sorry, drunk) by a  tentacle-beast.

958171,4,630505116X,"The more I watch this film, the more I like it. I recently re-watched it after seeing DEEP BLUE SEA. DEEP RISING is aimed at a lower level, really, and I think it's better off for it. A B-movie at heart, DEEP RISING  conquers DEEP BLUE SEA because it never once takes itself seriously, and  the blend of light comedy and horror works well (director Sommers proved it  a successful formula later with THE MUMMY).
It's not just the gags that I  like, either. There's something about the beginning of the film that I find  curiously evocative - this high tech speedboat racing racing racing with  single-minded, straight-line purpose toward an unknown destination in  complete darkness. The fact that the audience knows what the crew will find  when they arrive makes it more tantalizing.
Still, with a B-movie one  must have B-movie expectations. The CG effects are only average and often  unconvincing. The plot motivations are ridiculous. The acting ranges from  extremely engaging (Treat Williams) to labored (Anthony Heald).
The DVD  presentation is sparse (typical for a Hollywood Pictures release). The  transfer is great, but non-anamorphic. There is a trailer, but nothing else  of note. The sound quality is exceptionally good.
Sorry to go back to  this comparison, but here I go anyway. Where DEEP BLUE SEA is lofty, DEEP  RISING is lowbrow. Both are decent films, and each has its strengths over  the other, but since this one is a heckuvalot of fun (and the other just  plain isn't), I'd rather watch DEEP RISING again.

958209,3,630505116X,"While not trying to answer the meaning of life, Deep Rising does what it's trying to do, and that's entertain.  Director Stephen Sommers (who went on to better things after the relentlessly entertaining The Mummy) injects  enough action, humor, and cheap thrills to keep the average viewer from  being bored.  This is the sort of movie to watch by yourself or a friend or  two on a late Friday night.
The plot is cliched enough as it borrows  unashamedly from the Alien films, Die Hard, Titanic, Tremors, and The  Poseidon Adventure.  It's basically about these terrorists led by Wes Studi  who are trying to hi-jack a cruise ship called the Argonautica.  Along for  the ride are Finnegan (Treat Williams) and Pantucci (Kevin J. O'Connor) who  quickly discover that the Argonautica is empty.  Discovering a few more  survivors including a jewel thief (Famke Janssen), they find out there is a  creature on board that is feeding off of them and the survivors must do  what they can to get off alive.
Deep Rising is not meant to be taken the  least bit seriously unlike other creature features like the Alien films and  Pitch Black (which I very much highly recommend you watch).  Instead,  Stephen Sommers keeps his tongue firmly tucked in his cheek, leading to a  campy cruise most reminiscent of Tremors.  If there's at least one thing to  credit Deep Rising for, it has the look of a summer blockbuster.  The 50  million dollar budget is large (especially for a campy action/horror film)  and all the special effects are put to good use.  The creature effects are  well done and makes for a fun encounter between the survivors and the  creature's main body.  Rob Bottin, noted for the gory effects in The Thing,  succeeds again though the creation in this film may not be as well  remembered as some of his other works.
Deep Rising is an action film so  expect plenty of that.  While it's not terribly original action, they're  full of enough tension to keep anybody from dozing off.
As for acting,  this isn't exactly a first-rate cast.  Wes Studi is an underrated actor and  he probably deserves betteer work.  The same goes for Djimon Honsou in a  short appearance.  Treat Williams looks like he's having a lot of fun and  he is a charismatic hero.  Kevin J. O'Connor, no matter how annoying, is  still good comic relief, though Famke Janssen delivers a rather poor  performance, even in a movie of this sort.
So long as you watch this  film with the realization that it isn't meant to be taken seriously, you'll  have fun with it.  It's no classic by any means but you could do a lot  worse.",953769600,14,2597,4.651884700665189

Treat and the black dude were my favorite characters.  If you like  to watch movies not just because they are oscar caliber but just to have  fun, this is the movie.",950745600,,321,3.984375
958211,5,630505116X,This sounds like a nice horror flick with a dash of action. This movie is like alien only they are aboard a ship and the creature is in the ocean.  Buy it!,949622400,,155,3.84375

958282,1,630505116X,I RENTED THIS MOVIE WITH NO EXPECTATIONS WHAT SO EVER IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU RENT FOR THE HECK OF IT. FIRST OF ALL THE MOVIE WAS HOKY AND THE PLOT WAS STUPID IT HAD NO POINT WHAT SO EVER AND THERE WAS A LOT OF  OVERACTING IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I DID'NT CARE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO  THE PEOPLE FAMKE JANSSEN WAS NOT VERY GOOD NOR DID SHE LOOK TO GOOD EITHER.  ABOUT THE LAST 20-30 MINS IT JUST GOT BORING. THE ONLY GOOD SIDE IS THE  MUSIC FROM JERRY GOLDSMITH BUT EVEN THAT WAS NOT EXCELLENT OR VERY GOOD IT  JUST OK THATS THE BEST THING ABOUT IT.

958283,4,630505116X,"As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie I reckoned that it was not entirely serious about itself ... and upon renting the video was proved right! The unashamedly predictable story, the hilarious catchphrases  (""Now what?""), and the completely over-the-top monster make this  a fantastic fun B-movie.
 The acting is just right: Treat Williams does  a good deadpan version of his Han Solo character, Famke Janssen is  thankfully not cutesy as the romantic interest/raging heroine, and the  Nick Nolte lookalike guy is suitably evil ... my only objection was: can  Kevin J. O'Connor PLEASE clear his throat, the whiney voice grated after a  while.  All in all this film was just great, silly fun; but better-made  than it makes itself out to be, forgetting technobabble and story glitches  for real pacing, suspense and comic timing ... the effects were also cool  tho' over-the-top. Although all the gore, and the unusual way the creature  feeds, may not be for the squeamish, this is more of a comedy-horror than  real scary (half my screams during the film were of laughter). Somewhere  between Aliens and Tremors, I think (with a little Star Wars thrown in as  regards characterisation).",930182400,,1192,4.974619289340102
958284,5,630505116X,"This movie was hailed by many critics for poking fun at itself. I admit at some parts it did just that but that is not what makes it so endearing.  The fact that it takes the age old formula for a monster movie and sticks  to its guns all the way through isn't it either.  This movie is so great  because it's fun to watch!  The one liners were good, the effects were  awesome, the story was intriguing, and the overall effect was  ""Wow!"" If you haven't seen it do so.  By the way this movie was  directed by the same guy who did the recent remake of ""The Mummy""  which is also an excellent movie.",928886400,7,597,4.068965517241379
