5090439,2,B007IY10EQ,Not as interesting as it could have been. The commentary was good but the scope of the topic was so narrow.,1370304000,2,107,4.142857142857143
5090440,1,B007IY10EQ,"The idea for this documentary was great, but it showed nothing but the outside of the buildings. It certainly is a good look at the evolution of the architecture of the exterior but completely ignored the interior. It would have been awesome to see the mosaic room brought back to life but alas we are let down again. Is also sad at only 40 minutes in length. Like I said a great idea but much left to be desired.",1370044800,5,413,4.2405063291139244
5090441,5,B007IY10EQ,"I was expecting something good and it was excellent!!. After reading some years ago some old magazines with photographs of the then NEW Reich's Chancellery, I never thought I could be able to really experience the feeling of actually being there... A really good documentary, with learned explanations and detailed views. I do really recommend it!!",1364083200,8,348,5.232142857142857
5090442,5,B007IY10EQ,"If u r History or WWII buff, this is great addition to knowledge of Hitler's  Germany.
The visuals r extraordinary.",1361664000,7,115,4.75
8518137,3,B007IY10EQ,Computer generated tour of the building.  Would have been better if they included more period photos,1516838400,,100,5.25
8518138,4,B007IY10EQ,"PLOT: Computer Generated images and tour of the Reich Chancellery.

This is a COMPUTER GENERATED tour. The DVD has two choices for audio English OR German. The narrator speaks very good English and easily understood. This takes you on virtual tour and it is interesting. BUT you have to like history and have an interest in the subject. It takes us to the basement and then up. This is very well done. Included are the Winter Garden, basement, garage area, fire station. (yes there was one there due to air raids) how Hitler from his apartment could access all areas of the Chancellery. Also included are many ""explanations"" of why and how this was built. I give it 4 STARS~",1487980800,,674,4.616666666666666

8518140,3,B007IY10EQ,"Interesting regarding the exterior of the building, yet there is nothing regarding the interior of it. Anticlimactic and disappointing.",1453939200,,135,6.157894736842105
8518141,4,B007IY10EQ,"Very good addition to anyone's library or 3rd reich collection. There is ample information about the development of the buildings and great 3D renderings as well but for me to give it a 5-star review, it would have to contain more footage of Hitler's various room and how they were decorated. The documentary footage mainly discusses the exterior and the grounds surrounding it.",1442966400,,378,5.015873015873016
8518142,5,B007IY10EQ,Very interesting book,1442534400,,21,6.333333333333333
8518143,5,B007IY10EQ,"Great DVD of model of the Chancellery.  Shows out layout of buildings, information on building, construction example of bunker built and location under the reception hall.  Was surprised it didn't show the interior of many buildings, just a couple of them.  I was hoping for internal showing of the buildings.  But was impressed with the computer graphic generated picture layout of what it looked liked at the height of the German Reich, before the destruction from WWII.  Very educational, external layout of the Chancellery with a couple inside building diagrams/pictures made all by computer imagery.",1410566400,,604,5.315789473684211
8518144,5,B007IY10EQ,"Very good, fantastic graphics and very well made. This documentary is exactly as I expected it would be, I have a couple of docos from the same producers and they are all very good.",1393113600,6,181,4.352941176470588
8518145,4,B007IY10EQ,"As others have noted, the interior is not addressed here.  But the computer graphics for the external views are well done and very helpful if one is trying to understand the building, its uses, and how certain things were included or excluded in the construction.  Imposing some modern day shots over the images (at the end) would have been a nice touch, but this is all ""studio"" driven.  Short, but notable for what it does do.",1388620800,5,428,4.605263157894737

I was waiting to see the inside of the Reich Chancellery but it never arrived. I have had trouble with IHF before and this is no offence to Amazon who I have dealt with many times over numerious years and have always found them most trustworthy and reliable,and possibly one of the best distributors world wide. By reading other reviews here Iam not the only person angry at the shabby treatment by IHF. Virtual Tour indeed?, I would hate to pay them for a virtual tour of say New York, they would no doubt take me to the Empire State Building only and say that's the whole tour (showing me only the outside of course) I purchased 2 copies of this DVD and both are going in the rubbish bin, I have learned my lesson regarding IHF and that is 'If a person deceives me once shame on him,if they deceive me twice shame on me.
