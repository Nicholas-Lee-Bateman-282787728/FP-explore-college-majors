8338287,5,B001RMECNQ,"If you are interested in learning the basic techniques that will make you a better ice fisher, or hardwater hunter, these videos are for you. From simple directions about what jigging is and how to do it, to more complicated issues with using sonar, this video covers everything you need to know for your first trip out on the ice. I would also say, this video gives the average non-fishing person, adequate knowledge to prepare you for about 99% of what you will encounter on your first ice fishing trip.

Moving to ND from OH, I never ice fished. When I got up here, I learned just how popular this sport is, and how little I knew about this unique style of fishing. After my first fish-less trip to the ice, I bought this video from a local sporting goods store. I never went fish-less again.

These videos, by their very nature, seem ridiculous to anyone not interested in the subject. If you're like me, you've never sat through an entire one of these videos until you got interested in actually hitting the ice. I will say, I have since seen a number of these videos and In-Fisherman's products are superior to most others. Excellent knowledge of the subject, interesting commentary and helpful tips abound. I would unquestioningly recommend this to anyone looking to start their hardwater journey.",1255392000,2,1304,4.714912280701754
