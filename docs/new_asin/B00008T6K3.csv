7986788,3,B00008T6K3,"You Can't Win `Em All aka Soldiers of Fortune comes from the time when the studios were looking ever further East to save money while still getting some spectacle for their buck. With Spain and Italy increasingly expensive and the Soviet Union a bureaucratic nightmare, Turkey must have seemed like a good idea at the time for this riff on Vera Cruz that plants Charles Bronson's mercenary and Tony Curtis not-entirely-disillusioned adventurer (""I lost everything in a big war, maybe I can get some of it back in a small one"") in the dying days of the Ottoman Empire and working for the wrong side ostensibly escorting Turkish Bey Gregoire Aslan's daughters and a shipment of gold to safety. Naturally things aren't that simple and with everyone out for themselves they have as much to worry about from their `allies' - Fikret Hakan's colonel and Michele Mercier's mystery woman - as the rebels. There are few surprises and leading men aside it's short on starpower (fourth-billed Patrick Magee is hardly in the film for as many minutes), but director Peter Collinson delivers the action efficiently enough and at times the film looks like one of the more spectacular spaghetti westerns even if the film never really rises above the level of an acceptable second feature on the wrong half of a double-bill.

Sadly the DVD currently available is a Spanish release of dubious origin which, while 2.35:1 widescreen, isn't a great transfer, but it does have an English soundtrack and is currently the only version available.",1287532800,,1520,4.9375
7986789,4,B00008T6K3,"Filmed in much an international style, some Americans won't get this movie. Despite how it is depicted in the poster art, it is more of an action-comedy, not a whole lot of action but more of a 'two scoundrels on the take' plot line.

Bronson delivers some great lines and Curtis falls a bit flat throughout.  There seems to be no chemistry between the two leads.  Had this been a Bronson and Coburn flick, it would have been a smash hit.

This movie rises above B-movie status mainly because of the rarely photographed Turkish citites, ruins and landscapes.  Great cinematography gives it a big budget, epic feel.  Too bad it is not available in it's original 2:35 widescreen - the VHS is in full frame.

Definately worthwhile for Bronson fans as he has many great lines.  Also worth viewing for the fantastic Turkish landscapes.  I don't recall ever seeing them photographed so nicely before.

If you did like this movie, I highly recommend El Condor with Lee Van Cleef and Jim Brown, another little seen film with a similar theme and superb shooting locations!!",1174435200,2,1064,4.733695652173913
7986790,1,B00008T6K3,Vera Cruz was made in the 50's. It is still a outstanding movie with non stop action all the way. I have the movie you can't win em all.it is very poorly directed and has not so exciting action,1141516800,2,193,3.9743589743589745
