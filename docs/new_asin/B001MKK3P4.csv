8321400,5,B001MKK3P4,I use this DVD on a daily basis.  It doesn't matter what stage your at this is perfect.  She is soft spoken & soothing.  Enjoy because I think that's how a yoga workout should be,1504742400,,178,4.0285714285714285

Fantastic purchase",1433289600,,38,6.8
8321402,5,B001MKK3P4,"There are several poses within this DVD that are new to me: the teacup and fish poses.  The teacup pose is an excellent way to strengthen and stabilize your balance on your non-dominant side (right hand vs. left hand and vice versa). The pace of the Zen & Yoga - Heart of Flow DVD is moderate and slower - easy for beginners.  Claire is highly motivational too.  No painful stiffness or pulled muscle feeling afterwards. Interesting tidbit via DVD:  if you place your tongue @ firepoint, you won't grind your teeth at night.  I've tried the Sun Moon Yoga Series I DVD too - an easy/relaxing exercise as well.  I highly recommend trying both of these DVDs.",1294531200,3,655,4.555555555555555
8321403,5,B001MKK3P4,I went to one of the Chopra Center's retreats and was able to attend a couple of Claire's classes in person. She is incredible! I have purchased and love all three DVDs.
