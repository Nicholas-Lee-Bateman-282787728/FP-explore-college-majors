8244238,5,B00126809Y,Great show at the time and it was fun to relive the adventures from the early 60s as they drove across the country,1357862400,,114,4.0
8244239,4,B00126809Y,"In it's day Route 66 was one of my favorites, I was a car crazy 10 year old and all my 15 year old car crazy brother and I could think about was how badly we wanted a Corvette. It was cool to see a few episodes of the show but this compilation jumps around too much in it's time frame. It would be better to buy a whole season at one time. One thing that is neat is to see some of the young co-stars that have gone on to be mega stars like Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall etc.",1318377600,,472,3.73
8244240,5,B00126809Y,Ths was exactly what I wante. easy to navigate and great production considering the black and white format of the day. The stories are wonderful...,1258243200,,147,4.92
8244241,2,B00126809Y,"Remembering the series as great,especially the anticipation of seeing the new model Corvette each season,adventurous travel and human drama I naturally was excited with the release of this DVD collection. I await, patiently, the arrivals of 77 Sunset Strip and Run For Your Life collections. However,upon viewing this two-volume first season, I found it hard to comprehend what all the fuss was about. The show seems terribly dated,aside from the Corvette and the two leads Buz and Todd,the stories are uninteresting,the supporting actors' characters are forgetable,and the exciting locales seem to be stuck in California most of the time. By contrast, The Fugitive and Gunsmoke are far better to view. David Janssen is superb and the writing incredible..as is,the early seasons of Jim Arness and co.in Dodge City leave you wanting more. Not so with this series,I mean Buz with his fights and Todd with his Shakespearean mutterings are not enough to keep me watching..maybe it got better with later seasons,but Route 66 leaves me wishing I took the road less traveled.",1219881600,2,1068,5.215116279069767
8244242,5,B00126809Y,"Since the volume two of season one was screwed up, this was a nice compensation prize for the mistakes made the second collection of this series.",1210032000,,145,4.615384615384615
8244243,4,B00126809Y,"AFTER GOING BACK,AND SEEING THOSE FIRST EPISODES VOL. 1, WHEN WILL THE 2ND.3RD,AND 4TH. YEARS TAPE BE AVAILABLE? IT WOULD BE CRIMINAL NOT TO MAKE AVAILABLE THESE NEXT EXCITING EPISODES. I NEED THE FIX.",1208908800,,201,4.9411764705882355
8244244,2,B00126809Y,"What was Roxbury thinking here? It's almost as if they randomly yanked (as opposed to ""hand-picked"") three episodes out of the vault with the notion that fans would buy anything. There's nothing thematic about this selection (they're not even from same season) and (with exception of casting of Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and Peter Lorre in one excrutiatingly goofy episode) they're not even particularly memorable shows. Take a pass.",1206576000,8,437,5.257142857142857
8244245,5,B00126809Y,"The second half of the first season(1960-61)of the great Route 66. A truly great series of the early '60s. Bring on season two!

Neal Robertson",1206316800,,143,4.72
8244246,1,B00126809Y,"I agree with the others here: This is a wasted effort on the part of Roxbury/Infinity to bundle a mere handful of episodes onto a disc in no particular order, when fans are waiting for the FULL series. If they are going to waste their production effort on duplicating episodes like this, then they should go back and REMASTER Season 1, Volume 2, and give us a FULL FRAME edition to rectify the butchered one they are selling now with a cropped (FAKE) ""widescreen"" look.",1205539200,9,469,4.529411764705882
8244247,1,B00126809Y,"Yes, please put out complete 2nd and 3rd seasons at least. 2nd season and 1st part of season three are the best episodes. I was afraid it might stop after 1st season because perhaps sales don't warrant it but I've been waiting for years to get complete set. I encourage everyone to please make a comment here. Prometheus ""diosprometheus"" is 100% correct in his post",1204761600,12,365,4.630769230769231
