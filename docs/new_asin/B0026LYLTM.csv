3854280,3,B0026LYLTM,"Some of these reviews seem a bit harsh.  This is a direct to DVD film, it does not have the budget of a major motion picture.  We need to judge the film against its peers.  While the special effects are not award winning, I thought they were acceptable.  The crew did well with a limited budget and schedule.  The science is indeed goofy, but if we reject horror films with goofy science there won't be much left to watch.  I don't want to spoil the film, so I will only say that I liked Frank Whaley's performance and no one seemed to be sleep walking though the film.  All in all it is a nice watchable film and I will probably watch it again some time. I give it 3 stars and for the record, I would give the original ""The Cell"" 4 stars.",1267401600,6,739,4.090277777777778
3854281,1,B0026LYLTM,"This makes my top five horrible movies of all times list!  Just dreadful.  I loved ""The Cell"" with Lopez and was looking forward to part 2.  There is almost no conncetion to the first movie.  The acting his horrible.  My seven year old could have produced a more intriguing and convincing plot.  The worst part of all, however is the creative, stunning, amazing costuming and artful imagery of the first movie is completely non existent in this one.  It is predictable and and a total snooze fest. Nothing to see here folks, move along!",1264032000,2,536,4.638297872340425
3854282,1,B0026LYLTM,Very bad.  I should have trusted my first instinct and not jumped to get this one.  Just because a sequel has the same title as the original (The Cell - which was great!) does not guarantee satisfaction.  Very poorly written ... very poorly acted ... almost non-existent special effects.  Not even close to the visual masterpiece that was The Cell.  Stay away from this one.,1259712000,,374,4.6923076923076925
3854283,1,B0026LYLTM,I rented this movie because of the name. I figure it would have some nice special effects like the original. I knew that it was a direct to DVD sequel. I knew the special effects couldn't live up to the orignial. I agree the killer belongs to the SAW movies. Instead of him dying from cancer or he's just some average looking Joe. When this chicks goes into the killer mind there is not journey to be found. I keep seeing the same rooms and that's very dark and industrial looking. They couldn't even get her a killer wardrobe. It was very predictable and the characters were very predictable. Maybe Maya have been the most interesting character. Stay away from this film.,1246838400,3,672,4.516393442622951
3854284,1,B0026LYLTM,"Of all the films released in the last decade, ""The Cell"" would be one of the least likely candidates for a sequel. Well, they decided to make ""The Cell 2"" anyway, without Jennifer Lopez and Vincent D'Onofrio. In fact, ""The Cell 2"" could be called in any way you want, like ""Kiss the Girls 3"" or ""Saw 9."" Whatever it is, the film is a lifeless rehash of serial killer stories you ever heard, told in the most thrill-less fashion you can imagine.

Tessie Santiago is Maya, an agent who has special powers. Just by touching an object that belonged to someone, she can see things about that person. When an elusive serial killer named ""The Cusp"" is back, (and this killer, who abducts and tortures victims before killing, is actually responsible for her supernatural powers), she decides to use her unwanted ability again.

The story of ""The Cell"" (2000) was shallow at best, it is certain, but the original has the impressive visuals thanks to director Tarsem Singh, costume designers Eiko Ishioka and April Napier, and special make-ups by Michle Burke and Edouard F. Henriques (the last category nominated for Oscar). In the sequel, however, you have none of these nice visuals and designs (except the beautiful filming location of Utah) while the story gets only shallower, with the insipid storytelling, 30 minutes' worth of story dragged out to 90 minutes. Everything is repetitious and obvious in this painfully tiresome film.

I watched this in-name-only sequel partly because it has Frank Whaley. He is not bad, actually he is very good. He deserves a much better script than this one, though.",1246579200,16,1597,4.863970588235294
3854285,4,B0026LYLTM,"I saw this sequel to The Cell last night and I was skeptical since I am a true fan of The Cell -- but I actually enjoyed myself.  My husband and I both thought it was pretty creepy, pretty stylish/cool looking, and just plain fun.  Grab some popcorn and just enjoy this film for what it is.  It won't win an academy award, but it definitely gives some thrills and chills -- definitely a fun way to spend a couple of hours...!!",1245369600,3,426,4.170731707317073

3854287,2,B0026LYLTM,"Had to give this a fair shot as The Cell is a popular long-term rental here, but the franchise will have to stop there.

Laundry list/bad: writing, editing, sound mixing, acting, dead bodies that breathe in the morgue, corny macho local cops vs: Feds, C grade effects, really bad makeup, and so on. The kicker (for those that follow all of the bad flubs regarding medical stuff in film): Our main deputy and important character later in the film says: ""I used to be an EMT, I can check her pulse"" and does so for three seconds with his thumb and states she's all good. The writing was that caliber throughout.

The good: the two stars go for the beginning and end credits with those beautiful Utah mountains and salt flats in Blu clarity. Was a great promo for tourism there, but nothing else appears as relevant for testing the display or sound mixing. The supplemental documentary ran 30 minutes and wreaked of how incredible everyone was to work with. Includes some great examples of what not to say about film making and how not to be interviewed during your early acting career.

You might get some light entertainment as a rental, and I want to list all of the other things wrong with this, but I do not want to harp on it any more. Not a reference Blu, can't recommend it.",1244592000,3,1279,4.48068669527897
3854288,1,B0026LYLTM,"Nothing even close to the first.  I was completely let down by the afects and by the story line.  When I read about the movie, they comparied it to the first movie with Jennifer Lopez, I do not believe that it should have even been allowed to use the same title let alone call it a continuation of the first Cell movie.  Not recommended to anyone.  Do not buy or watch if you liked the first Cell movie and are hoping for the same excitement.",1414713600,,442,4.1647058823529415

3854291,3,B0026LYLTM,"I didn't want to spend to much on this movie because I shouldn't have had to replace it in the first place from someone who had stole it from me but anyway, I hate stickers being on the cases so I always peel them off but I was unhappy to find I cannot peel this off cause it had been on the case to long which really irritates me",1397433600,,330,3.7971014492753623
3854292,1,B0026LYLTM,"the first ""the cell"" with Jennifer Lopez had a storyline, great set decoration, wardrobe etc. I won't criticize a movie for a low budget, but if they're going to sequel ""the cell"" they should spring for a better writer and set decoration. Not good at all.",1395100800,,255,4.565217391304348
3854293,1,B0026LYLTM,"""The Cell 2"" is missing two important things:
1. Tarsem Singh's breathtaking visuals.
2. Anything related to the original ""Cell"" movie.

And therein lies the central problem of ""The Cell 2"" -- it's not so much a sequel as it is a generic serial-killer movie with the slight conceit of a person entering another person's mind. It's a dreary, bleak little story that relies on vague psychic superpowers and the world's least competent FBI investigation to keep things moving... and yet I never managed to care.

A serial-killer known as the Cusp kidnaps young women, tortures them, kills them and then revives them. Maya (Tessie Santiago) was the only victim that escaped, but it gave her psychic powers to enter another person's mind if she handles something they touched. After many failures, she quits the FBI... only for them to come seeking her when another girl is kidnapped.

But because of obviously-planted evidence, they conclude that the local sheriff Harris (Chris Bruno) must be the Cusp. Maya, deeply attached to the man she met twenty minutes ago, knows that he isn't, so she helps him escape so they can find the Cusp. The Cusp has slightly more brains than your average shellfish, so they are able to find his lair in no time -- only to find that he is waiting for Maya.

Any pretense of sci-fi tech or psychological complexity is pretty much thrown out early in ""The Cell 2."" Now it's all about magical psychic powers and the power of will -- culminating in a truly absurd scene where the Cusp reveals that he studied parapsychology, which somehow taught him how to psychically entrap psychic people in his brain. Yes, it's that stupid.

When it isn't being blindingly stupid, Tim Iacofano's direction is instead incredibly generic -- there's a serial-killer, the FBI is after him, and anyone with the deductive capabilities of a squid could figure out how to find him. There are plot holes the size of Mars littering the whole story, including the question of how the killer managed to go around abducting girls with nobody noticing his absence.

It's also... strangely nonchalant. Nobody seems very upset or worried about women being kidnapped and tortured, even their family members. Even the killer's identity is handled in a halfhearted manner. There's no big reveal -- he just shows up with his hood off, chattering like a maiden aunt.

And if you're hoping for a follow-up to Singh's glorious visuals, you'll be disappointed. The inner minds are represented by Tony Stark's bathroom and an industrial plant, with CGI memory tiles that look like leftovers from ""Tron."" Bad green-screen, away! Oh, and we're notified of the killer's evil by his digitally-deepened voice, which is more unintentionally funny than scary.

As the final cherry on top, the ending credits show a landscape that never appears in the movie. It's gorgeous scenery, but it honestly feels like they had run out of anything resembling inspiration.

One of the few things that carries over from the previous movie is the casting -- apparently they decided to keep the ""traumatized Latina teams up with pasty white guy"" theme. Santiago has the charisma and acting ability of a block of wood (""Welcome to the darkness""), seeming merely smug when confronting her killer; Bart Johnson and Bruno are instantly forgettable; and Frank Whaley spends too much time impishly prancing and chewing scenery to ever be even vaguely scary.

""The Cell 2"" is a mass of halfhearted cliches, bad acting and a script less complicated than your average TV mystery show. It's too boring to even be ""so bad it's good.""",1387238400,6,3587,4.914049586776859

3854295,2,B0026LYLTM,"The Cell 2 is different from the Original, which is not all bad.  It has an interesting villain, who keeps ""killing"" his victims and then bringing them back from the brink of death.  While it does not have the name stars that were in the original, the actors do a competent job.  Unfortunately, the movie lacks any suspense, and in the end, is a disappointment.  Watch the original for great acting and an interesting premise.",1342828800,,426,4.64
3854296,2,B0026LYLTM,"If The Cell was directed in the 80s, had the next-best-thing to Jennifer Lopez, and was nothing like The Cell at all, it would be The Cell 2.

Some films are a natural progression from the original, others are The Cell 2. Follow a carnival gypsy as she reads fortunes and looks into the present to unravel a serial killer's secret.

Wasn't the original ""The Cell"" some nonsense about using technology to enter a killer's mind and being in some whacky killer's mind world? This is some different nonsense about a magical witch using voodoo and items of the victims to see what they see. They're not remotely the same line of movies, might as well call Jurassic Park ""Little Women 2"". Nudity less than 10 minutes into the film, so there's no need to watch more than 10 minutes of this.",1282953600,9,783,4.507042253521127
3854297,3,B0026LYLTM,"Being killed and brought back to life many times has to suck. That's what the victems in this film have to face before being killed for real. The cell 2 is for sure not as great as the cell, but it does have some good parts. The mind of the killer is not as exciting as the previous killer but it's still a little wicked. All the colors and mirrors were cool. The characters you don't really care for but the plot is enjoyable enough and the acting is fine. It's a blockbuster rental.",1282262400,2,484,4.159574468085107

8352992,3,B0026LYLTM,"Reading the reviews ahead of watching the movie I knew that this would not be a sequel to The Cell.
It is loosely based on the concept of travelling into another mind to find out information needed to solve the case.
Maya Castenada (Tessie Santiago) is the loosely copied JLO clone that met with the serial killer who likes to kill women then bring them back to life.
Maya is the only one who survived her deaths and as a result is able to read minds, and the mind of the killer.
The killer is out again capturing women and killing them six times, then finally killing them for good. This time he has the sheriff's niece, and the sheriff, the FBI, and Maya are all after the killer
Early about the middle of the movie the director exposes the killer to you and the rest is a struggle to save the niece and the story unfolds into views of both Maya's mind and the killers.
The production is obviously low budget but come on, it wasn't that terrible. It was worth the price of a rental for one viewing.
There were some fairly good effects and the acting was so cheesy it was enjoyable.
Relax, don't take yourself so seriously, grab a friend and some popcorn and pop. Settle in and have fun.
Worth at least one watch.",1444608000,3,1214,4.3056768558951966
