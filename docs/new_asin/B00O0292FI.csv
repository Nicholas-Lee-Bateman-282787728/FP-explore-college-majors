6697054,3,B00O0292FI,"Woody Allen is a lot like Roman Polanski - a despicable public figure who makes magical movies that I cant help but love. Woody Allen movies are a lot like Christmas - coming once a year, packaged familiarly, through Sony Pictures Classics, with opening credits in his signature Windsor font, usually to a 1920s jazz song. SPC has the sense to release his films usually in the dog days of summer, for audiences that don't want to see something with explosions and violence.

The way I see it, Allen makes a great film every other year. 2011 saw Midnight in Paris, a true return to form for the director. 2012 saw To Rome With Love, a somewhat lesser work. 2013 saw the almost instant classic Blue Jasmine, so we are in an off-year for Allen. Magic in the Moonlight is far from a bad movie, but its also far from Allens best work.

The film follows a magician (Colin Firth) in 1920s France who is told of a young clairvoyant (Emma Stone) with apparently real powers. He is on a mission to out her for the fraud he thinks she is. What follows is basically the standard rom-com formula.

I must address the elephant in the room. Colin Firth is 53 years old, Emma Stone is 25. This is gross (and not uncharacteristic of Allen) but lets continue.

Despite that, this pair shines. Both Firth and Stone give very nice performances, and they do have considerable chemistry. The writing and tone just feel bland and forgettable. Its also a gorgeous thing to look at - the scenery and period costumes are beautiful! Allen does such a good job visualizing the 20s that I almost thought he would have done a great job with the recent remake of The Great Gatsby.

So, in the end, we have yet another very watchable Woody Allen film, even though its kind of flat and lifeless. There are a few laughs and some nice performances by a talented cast to see, but Magic in the Moonlight is not nearly as magical or clever as it thinks it is. Its a perfectly pleasant time-waster for the dead of summer, but it makes one long for the great film Allen will make next year.

6697055,3,B00O0292FI,"Set in Southern France in 1927 (Woody Allen clearly loves the jazz age), Colin Firth plays here a super rational British magician who as a side job is also an expert at debunking all kind of psychics. A former colleague comes to see him to ask for his help in debunking a young American clairvoyant called Sophie (Emma Stone, radiant) who might be skimming a wealthy couple. When he meets her, he is initially skeptical, but as she seems to know more and more about him he starts having doubts. Might she have real connections to the occult world? And all his life dedicated to debunking mysticism might have been for nil?

I kind of like it for about 40 minutes, but then it started to get worse and worse. Extremely verbose, even for a Woody Allen movie, the earnest discussions about the meaning of life and the constant quoting of Nietzsche soon gets pretty tiresome. The crucial plot twist that reveals her nature is nifty, but the ending is pretty horrible. And then there are the creepy hints of a romantic relationship developing between the fifty-something Firth and the very young Sarah that seems to recall the private life of a certain film director.

The red haired, wide blue eyed Stone is one of the major draws of the film, as is the Southern France settings. Also with Marcia Gay Harden and Eileen Atkins, among others.",1413158400,4,1336,4.632911392405063
6697056,4,B00O0292FI,"Woody Allens directorial career can be described as nothing less than industrious. While some would agree with this term due to his ability to churn out a movie year after year, I choose to use it because of his ability to diligently construct such beautiful films that always build towards something truly worth thinking about. In fact, Allen even appeared not as a director but as an actor in John Turturros film Fading Gigolo, released earlier this year. This industriousness is something unmatched by any filmmaker working today.

Magic in the Moonlight is Allens latest film and the 39th feature length film he has written, directed, and released within a year of his previous film. This uninterrupted string dates all the way back to 1977s Annie Hall! Of course, some of these films are stronger than others, I hesitate to call any of them failures.  On a Podcast interview with Josh Horowtiz, Allen confesses that he is always displeased with the final product but that if you just keep working, youll have your share of good stuff over the years. Advice-wise, it doesnt get much more simple and sweet than that and as movies go, they don't get much more simple and sweet than Magic in the Moonlight.

Following last years tragically comic Blue Jasmine with a tour-de-force performance from Cate Blanchett that won her an Oscar, Magic in the Moonlight has a far more breezy and light tone. Set in Europe in the late 1920s, Colin Firth plays Stanley, a tightly wound and cynical magician who performs in disguise as the mysterious illusionist of the orient, Wei Ling Soo. Stanley is excellent at his craft and has made a habit in his spare time of exposing false mystics and people claiming to be psychics. One such character is a young American woman hired by a wealthy widow Grace Catledge (Jackie Weaver) in the south of France to help her contact her dead husband. When Stanleys friend Howard (Simon McBurney) asks Stanley to accompany him to the Catledge estate in order to judge the authenticity of this so-called medium, Stanley takes the challenge. Unexpectedly, Stanley is taken off guard by the allure and inexplicable talent of this clairvoyant beauty named Sophie (Emma Stone). The film spends its remaining time building an unlikely bond between the two as Stanley begins to doubt his certainty in the non-existence of the spirit world. The relationship between Stanley and Sophie is further complicated by the relentless wooing of Lady Catledges wealthy and persistent son, Brice (Hamish Linklater) who promises Sophie a life showered in luxury.

On the surface, Magic in the Moonlight is a simple love story and while it certainly is that, there is also a more serious story beneath the surface about skepticism and its role in the concept of existence. Stanley is so abruptly tugged back and forth between the joys of fantasy and the doldrums of certainty that it becomes clear that Allen himself as writer/director may be using this film as a somewhat veiled exploration of his own existence. The writing at times has a ring of Mark Twain in it especially in its tongue-in-cheek assault on hypocrisy and ease in defrauding the foolish. These serious subtexts, however, are quite subtle; this is an entirely sweet film overall.

And a beautiful one as well. Allens photography of the Southern region of France is absorbingly beautiful. Full of sunsets, landscapes, and lush picturesque locations, the setting comes alive and functions as a character of its own. As usual, the acting is crisp and alive. Firths bravado as a stubbornly conceited Englishman is impeccable and enjoyable and Stones appealingly goofy American psychic is charming. The element that is so curiously minimal, however, is magic. Of course the magic does refer to the metaphorical sense of connection between the leads, but in a film with so many magicians as characters, I expected more of Allens trademarked prestidigitations! The film opens with Firths Wei Ling Soo performing one of his illusions, but that is simply to establish him as an expert in the trade. I would have also liked to see some of the defrauding and debunking of con-artist illusionists that Stanley so often brags about. Still this is another well crafted entry into Allens immaculate resume and Stone appears to be his next go-to leading lady as she is already cast as the lead in his next project. This is a slighter movie than his previous effort, but it is not without charisma! B+

Magic in the Moonlight is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes.",1412726400,9,4542,4.892207792207792

6697058,1,B00O0292FI,"I like most Woody Allen's films quite a bit, even some that most people don't appreciate, such as TO ROME WITH LOVE, CELEBRITY, and SHADOWS AND FOG.  This one, however, struck me as a real botch. I can't really point to a specific problem. It just seems awkward and dull. All.  The. Way. Through. None of the actors can make the dialogue work--not that it should seem ""realistic"" since this is supposed to be a stylized kind of film to a certain extent, but it should be gracefully deployed.  After all, this is, in a sense, designed as a pastiche of Ernst Lubitsch-era cinema, and the acting and dialogue in Lubitsch's films were anything but wooden and maladroit.  Jacki Weaver and Eileen Atkins don't embarrass themselves, but Hamish Linklater, the usually strong Emma Stone, and Oscar-winners Colin Firth and Marcia Gay Harden come across like they're doing a first read-through on a rehearsal stage.  On top of that, the story is predictable, the cinematography (despite the south of France to work with) is pedestrian, and the pacing lethargic.  It may be one of Allen's worst films--down there with HOLLYWOOD ENDING.  Oh well, I'll be there again on the first weekend to see his next film.  I never miss one.",1412467200,18,1215,4.779904306220096

What did I think?

I confess I'm a Woody Allen tragic, but as a rule, even I can admit only every second film he makes is a real winner.  Blue Jasmine was a hard act to follow, and Magic In The Moonlight IS lovely; just not amazing. Lovely scenery, lovely cast, lovely performances, lovely art direction, but somethings missing.

6697060,4,B00O0292FI,"""Magic In the Moonlight"" (2014 release; 97 min.) is the latest from writer-director Woody Allen, now a crisp 78 years young, if you can believe it. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Berlin, 1928"", and we are introduced to Stanley Crawford (played by Colin Firth), a magician who delights audiences with his various tricks and deception. After the performance, an old friend (and former magician rival)of his, Howard Burkan (played by Simon McBurney). invites Stanley to join him in the South of France, where a supposed clairvoyant woman, Sophie (played by Emma Stone). is enthralling (or is it deceiving?) an entire family. Howard wants Stanley to figure out whether the woman is a fraud or for real. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of commets: first, this is the latest in Woody Allen's what I like to call ""European travelogue"" movies, which started in 2005 with ""Match Point"" and culminated most recently with 2012's ""To Rome With Love"". Woody has done France before (including his best-grossing movie ever, 2011's ""Midnight in Paris""), but not the south of France. Et voila! Second, it is rather surprising that Woody Allen, himself a former magician in his younger years, hasn't until now made a movie in which magic has been a central point. Third, the movie walks a fine line between genres, although in the end I thought of this mostly as a rom-com, albeit with some other undercurrents. Fourth, one of the movie's biggest challenges is the lack of chemistry between the Colin Firth and Emma Stone lead characters. But is that really surprising, given their respective ages (53 and 25)? We all know Woody likes his women younger, but c'mon already! Last but not least, the movie was perhaps most notable (for me anyway) for its once again pristine soundtrack, truly a trademark of most Woody Allen's movies. The soundtrack is chockfull of memorable tunes from the 1920-30s, featuring such artists as Leo Reisman, Bix Beiderbecke, Al Bowlly, and on and on, just outstanding.

I saw ""Magic In the Moonlight"" in August during a family visit in Belgium. As you may know, Woody Allen is far more popular in Europe than he is in the US. The early evening screening where my sister and I saw this at in Antwerp, was quite well attended, even though the movie had already been playing there for weeks. Bottom line: ""Magic in the Moonlight"" is pleasant enough as you are watching it, but about 10-15 minutes after the movie was over, I commented to my sister ""that was delightful, if utterly forgettable, wasn't it?"", and she concurred whole-heartedly. I'd nevertheless suggest that you check this out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",1411948800,58,2780,4.838235294117647
6697061,5,B00O0292FI,"This is a charming Woody Allen (directed and written) observational romantic comedy.

It's set in late 1920s Provence, and the scenery is gorgeous.

What is it about?

Stanley (Colin Firth) is a famous magician and skeptic. His friend asks him to investigate an attractive female medium (Emma Stone). Is she a fraud or genuine? As he investigates her extraordinary talents, he falls in love.

This is a gentle romantic comedy, with a keen sense of observation, and clever dialogue. The two main characters are engaging, as their mutual attraction draws them closer...

Both Mr Firth and Ms Stone play their roles well; in some scenes, I was reminded of Mr Firth's character in ""Love Actually"" as he pursues the object of his affections.

And, the supporting cast is excellent.

For aficionados of Woody Allen, this is another movie you will enjoy. And it's a good movie for anyone who enjoys a charming period comedy romance.",1411862400,96,925,4.929032258064516
6697062,5,B00O0292FI,"I just love this movie, but it makes me sad that so many actors who have work for Mr. Allen have now turned against him.  He really brings out the best in actors, and makes watching his movies such enjoyable experiences.  It isn't fair for them to judge him or destroy all his great movies, and lifetime of work over allegation that have been through the court system and he was not found to be what or do what he was accused of. It seems to me public opinion has replace Common Law. That is wrong.  There is no common sense left either.  I stand by Mr. Woody Allen , he has brought so much laughter and joy to me through his movies.  Those that accuse a person or won't work with him are wrong to have dismissed him, they should apologize to him. His movies are not violent, or vulgar, and filmed in beautiful locations. He is a very talented director as you see he brings out the actors have to offer. It would have been better had you actors say nothing, but for those who work for him and spent time on the set film have you no loyalty to this man.  Will I do and will always.
Truly awesome movie.  Best line in movie is, ""tell me something I don't already know"".  That would be that Woody Allen makes great movies.
Thank you Woody for decades of laughter.",1516147200,5,1260,4.199170124481328

6697113,3,B00O0292FI,"Cute film.  Been years since I have watched a new Woody Allen film.  I do admire his prolific film making and direction, visuals, and humor, but the story was a little thin, and Emma Stone was out of her league with her co-star, Colin Firth.  Give me any of those Game of Throne chicks over Emma any day for acting chops!  I get why directors like to mix it up with younger, inexperienced actors with an older A List cast; possibly to attract a younger audience.  But Emma was well out-paced by her English counterparts in this film.  Plus, that old Woody Allen cringe factor with having a younger girl with a much, much older man as the romantic lead, was in play and was simply not very appealing .

6697148,2,B00O0292FI,"It's beautifully filmed and boasts exquisitely lush settings and costumes, but that's not why I watch a Woody Allen film.  The story is disjointed, and never seems to find its footing.  There is absolutely no chemistry between Stone and Firth, no spark at all, and it shows -- big time.  In fact, the entire film lacks spark.  Nothing really happens in the story to support Firth's falling head over heels. He simply tells us it is so.

Stone, while a fine actor in many ways, doesn't have the necessary edge in her performance to help her hold her own against the remarkable talents of Firth, Atkins, and McBurney, all three of whom manage to shine with very limiting material.  She's practically decoration. There are several instances when it's obvious she is struggling with her lines -- Allen should have taken the time to have her redo the scenes until she got them right. Jacki Weaver, as the addled widow seeking contact with her husband in the spirit world, for all intents and purposes is playing Sally Struthers playing an addled widow.  In fact, for a moment, I thought it was Sally Struthers.  And why cast Melissa Gay Harden in what could have been a meatier role if you weren't going to use her?  Again, mostly background noise.

Woody Allen writes dialogue for Woody Allen, not necessarily for the actors involved.  When I imagined lines being delivered in his deadpan, hesitant voice, the dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny.  But not so much when the other actors try to deliver them.

Nevertheless, there are a lot worst ways to while away an hour and a half. The players represent the kind of top notch cast that Allen usually assembles to examine the questions he routinely asks of the universe and in this episode we have Colin Firth almost reprising Fitzwilliam Darcy, but this time taking on both the Pride and the Prejudice. He plays Stanley Crawford who, in the form of his stage alter-ego, master magician, Wei Ling Soo, creates stunning illusions to baffle his Jazz Age audiences.

The feisty young maiden Firth has to match in this embodiment of the three Ps (Ive added pomposity, as well), comes in the attractive form of clairvoyant, Sophie (Emma Stone), whose special powers Crawford is called upon, by a long-time friend and rival magician, to debunk. This proves to be quite a challenge even to someone with Crawfords successful de-bunking history but, against the opulent backdrop of 1920s Cote dAzur, and the excellence of the ensemble cast, results in an effectively witty entertainment.

Special mention must go to the superb Eileen Atkins, (almost destined, it seems, to be a kind of existential understudy to that other British Grande Dame, Maggie Smith), whose presence in any film is usually a recommendation in itself.",1448668800,,1366,4.9868421052631575

6697178,5,B00O0292FI,"Magic in the Moonlight is one of the very best movies Woody Allen has ever made.  He has written a movie that in every way is a movie made decades ago.  He has taken us all back in time, to a less hectic era.  The movie itself never hurries.  The year is 1928.

Several critics have faulted it for being predictable.  Do you remember the Thin Man movies?  They are totally predictable!  This is simply one of the ways that this movie perfectly imitates a movie made in the '20's.  Allen has chosen to make the movie predictable as part of making a movie that is from the past.  This is not a fault; rather, it is extremely artful film-making.  And it is one factor in the almost stress-free nature of the film.  Predictable is non-stress.

The main character, Stanley, played by Colin Firth, is a master magician.  In his act, he disguises himself as a Chinese man named Wei Ling Soo.  The movie opens with him performing in Germany - in Berlin.  He is dressed in sumptuous flowing Chinese robes, and wears a mask and pigtailed wig.  As Wei Ling, he moves in a completely different way than I have ever seen Colin Firth move, with flourishes and drama in each step.  I caught the movie on TV and missed the credits.  I had no idea I was watching Colin Firth until he removed his costume.

Wei Ling's act is amazing:  he disappears a costumed and full-grown elephant, and then he himself disappears and reappears in a way that is impossible.  Then, the movie moves to the French Riviera, to the countryside around Nice, to Provence, and the Cote d'Azur.

Allen has chosen each location with great care.  Several times, Stanley drives along the breathtaking cliff-top roads of the Mediterranean coast, as he goes from the home where he is staying, in Nice, to his aunt's home in Provence. Whenever he takes these drives, there is nothing to jar you back into the present.  There is not a single home in sight, nor are there any other cars.  The sky has been artfully painted so that we never see an airplane.  Nor do we ever hear one.  It takes us back to a time when the world was less populated, when it was more pristine.  And, once the movie moves to France, he uses a filter throughout the film, creating a warm glow that implies a happier and kinder time.

When we see the outside of one of the mansions, they are clean and beautiful, with no sign of pollution, and with lush and well-cared for gardens surrounding them.  The beauty of the sets and the addition of the warm glow make you want to go back in time, to step inside the film.

There is one part of the movie where everyone attends a ball.  The ballroom is outdoors, under a roof supported by Grecian columns.  The women are all costumed in glorious dresses from the '20's.  As the scene begins, the camera follows several characters as they hasten to the ball, and we slowly see the scene of the ball come into view.  The music, the setting, every aspect of the scene is so absolutely inviting.  Every minor actor is stress-free, relaxed and gracefully enjoying the evening, totally unlike any character in a modern movie.  You know this is due to Woody Allen's direction.

The plot revolves around a sideline of Stanley's; he debunks phony psychics and mediums.  There was a medium craze during this era.  He does not believe any of them truly have these skills. An old friend, also a magician, visits him backstage in Germany, and tells him about a young woman who claims to have these skills.  The friend has not been able to find fault with her abilities.  She is currently in France, and this is what moves the movie there.  Her name is Sophie, and she is played by a very appealing Emma Stone.  From the very first scene, it seems that Sophie is a real psychic.  The interaction between Stanley's skepticism and Sophie's abilities is the heart of the movie, as is their attraction.

Some reviewers have found this December-May romance improbable, in fact they find all such romances unbelievable.  (There is a 28-year age difference between the two actors.)  But there have been several very successful May-December relationships in the world of entertainment.  To name just a few, Humphrey Bogart was 45 when he met 20-year old Lauren Bacall, a 25-year age difference; Michael Douglas is 25 years older than Catherine Zeta-Jones; and, Charlie Chaplin was 36 years older than Oona O'Neil.

Magic in the Moonlight is a welcome few hours of calm, a moment of relaxed relief from today's world of unsolvable problems and the stress everyone is feeling because of them.",1442966400,,4537,4.580845771144278

6697185,1,B00O0292FI,"Woody Allen has made some truly great films. But with Woodys films, it really is hit-and-miss. Midnight in Paris was wonderful, Blue Jasmine was  well, not so wonderful.

The problem with some of Woodys films is that they tackle issues that he simply does not have the intellectual sophistication to handle. Think Hannah and her Sisters: a funny, beautifully-filmed movie, but dealing with deep issues of life and death in a superficial manner. Example:

Woody: If there is a God, then why are there Nazis?
Woodys Dad: How should I know why there are Nazis? I don't even know how a can opener works!

Its the same thing with this film: clever script, nice cinematography, with an attempt to tackle some of the most profound and important issues for us mortals  and he concludes with a shallow cop-out.

The story concerns a nasty, cynical professional magician with an extremely bleak, atheistic outlook on life. He is asked to debunk a young female medium, fails to do so, and comes to believe her powers are genuine.  As a result, for the first time in his adult life, he is filled with joy, his nastiness and cynicism vanish, and he begins to become a better person.

And then Woody pulls the rug out: she turns out to have been a fraud all along. His cynicism and nastiness return, and Woody leaves us with the idea that although we live in a bleak material universe, weak-minded people need to believe in the unseen in order to get by. Bravo, Woody.

But if Woody had done his homework, he would have found that there was an intense study of mediums by many of the leading intellectuals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries  including the esteemed physicists Sir Oliver Lodge and (latter knighted) William Crookes in England, and in the USA, the renowned Harvard psychologist/philosopher William James, professor of philosophy James Hyslop, and professor of chemistry Robert Hare. Although frauds were certainly exposed, the researchers also found several mental mediums that they could not discredit  and most of these were not professionals (that is, they accepted no payment for their services, and were sometimes wives of politicians and other prominent men).

As far as I am aware, there was only one professional medium that greatly impressed the researchers  a Mrs Leonora Piper of Boston. William James studied her, and was deeply impressed. She was then brought to London to be studied by the British researchers, because she was unlikely to have any confederates in a city she had never previously visited. Although she was trailed by private detectives, no trace of suspicious activity was uncovered, and she performed as well in London as in Boston.

There is not space enough here to do justice to these claims  those interested in exploring the issue further may consult my third book Science and the Afterlife.

But to return to the film: out of sheer ignorance or intellectual timidity, Woody acknowledges none of these facts, not even in passing.  Why could he not have at least mentioned this rigorous and extensive research on both sides of the Atlantic, at least in a conversation between some of the characters?

For whatever reason, Woody concludes with cynicism and pseudo-skepticism.  For those viewers who are familiar with the research I mentioned above, the film will seem shallow.

Both Emma and Colin acted well and also most people are saying beautiful scenary which is true and a couple of familiar faces. I also like the fact it took place in the 1920's love 1920's costumes in the hairdo's as well. I didn't however like the storyline at all and misunderstood it as well.

It turns out that wasn't the case at all. It was kind of that way at first,but after awhile Colin realized the character Emma played was just pretending to be a psychic. This movie  encourages people who are skeptics to contiue to be Skeptic  and it's an insult to people like myself who has true  psychic abilities that I use to help people rather then make money alot of times. I offer the free reading free on Facebook. This movie treats spirituality as a joke and I don't like that I really don't. If you are a person who takes spirituality seriously believes in psychic abilities,tarot cards,mediumship and more and have psychic abilities such as myself don't see this movie it would probably make you feel bad like it did me. This movie is a great movie for the skeptic. I am glad I didn't spend money to see it.",1439769600,,1616,4.344370860927152

6697223,4,B00O0292FI,"Magic in the Moonlight (2014)

 I found this a refreshing change from the often pessimistic, nihilistic and just gloomy fair offered up by Woody Allen, the writer and director of Magic in the Moonlight.  Magic is a love story that we can embrace and enjoy.  It does encompass the typical Woody Allen imaginative plot and vivid, interesting characters.
 The story involves an American psychic and an Englishman, a professional debunker, who suspects that she is attempting to defraud her gullible customers.
 Allen we have long known for directorial skills.  The most recent of his four Academy Awards he received for the 2012 film Midnight in Paris.  Like him or not he has been an unparalleled force in American cinema for a very long time.  His Oscars have come to him for both writing and directing.
 The dialog Allen writes for the players here sparkles with wit.  You have a sense that the actors enjoy their roles very much.  As a director, Allen here employs wonderful actors to recite his words.
 Oscar winner Colin Firth plays the psychic debunker with the careful restraint of an Englishman of his class and period (the 1920s).  Emma Stone, beauty, Oscar winner in her own right and all around wonderful actress, plays the American psychic with enthusiasm and verisimilitude.  We believe that she may well be a genuine psychicor that she may be a trickster conning the gullible Europeans.
 Add to the leading pair the 81 year old English actress Eileen Atkins as Colin Firth's aunt and you have a winning team.  Atkins has nearly 100 roles to her credit.  She is spectacular in her supporting role.
 With Magic in the Moonlight we have Oscar winning actors reciting lines written by an Oscar winning writer and directed by an Oscar winning director.  What could go wrong?
 Nothing.  This small period romantic comedy has it all.
 PG-13 with a length of one hour and 37 minutes this four saw blade film will reward your time with smiles.",1431302400,2,1946,4.812688821752266
6697224,4,B00O0292FI,"It is hard to dislike Magic in the Moonlight, Woody Allens romantic comedy set in the idyllic 1920s Southern France. Certainly this is not the greatest film from Woody Allen and the romance itself is rather predictable, but the light-hearted film is enjoyable, thanks to the capable performances from the stars Emma Stone and Colin Firth.

Colin Firth is Wei Ling Soo, a world-famous illusionist, who is in fact a skeptical British man named Stanley. Now Howard (Simon McBurney), Stanleys old friend, visits him, asking him to help debunk a fortune teller and medium Sophie (Emma Stone). Stanley agrees, travels to the Cte d'Azur, where Sophie is staying with a rich American family.

As you expect, Stanley is first interested in beautiful and spirited Sophie professionally, and then attracted to her romantically. In the romantic scenes you will notice several topics that have been touched upon in Woody Allens past movies  magic tricks, mortality and universe, etc.  but Allen seems not interested in them as much as before. Even some characters (like Catherine McCormacks Olivia, Stanleys fiance) are quickly forgotten.

Still, Magic in the Moonlight manages to entertain, with delightful Colin Firths cynic-turned-romantic protagonist. This is a pleasant and optimistic Woody Allen movie. It is even more optimistic and light-hearted than Midnight in Paris and you know what you are going to have.",1431216000,,1404,5.278026905829597
6697225,4,B00O0292FI,"Wow. After reading some of the negative reviews, I wondered if we watched the same movie.....but as the French say...' chacun son got'. ...not everyone likes the same thing.  First, I totally bought Firth as the main character.  I really enjoyed seeing him in this role and thought he played it rather well. I thought the casting was very good - especially Atkins as Aunt Vanessa and Emma Stone as Sophie.  The plot was interesting, and standard ""Woody Allen New York Angst"" - which I find funny. (Although I'm not a fan of his at this point -- after certain situations have come to light. I didn't know he directed this until after I had watched it. )

I loved the scenery and the ""eye candy' of the beautifully designed sets and costumes.  The props were lovely - from the black and white parasol that was carried by an extra and filmed from above as she walked away.....which served to create a sumptuous feast of textures as the opening of a new scene before any dialogue was even spoken - to the pearlescent hues of Aunt Vanessa's pearls held in the hands of Sophie as an 'emotional touchstone' for her to discover the secret lost love on Aunt Vanessa's life. Atkins did a fabulous job of creating depth in her character.

As to the 'negative comments about God' that one reviewer spoke of....I do understand. But, to me, the beauty of the script was in how much these pseudo-intellectuals long for meaning in their lives, especially the grace of faith.  At one point, Firth's dialogue is quite eloquent on the subject as he equates the belief in a God to the dignity of man.  Really....here we see Woody Allen's interior struggle with the concept of God as he approaches his dotage.

I found the movie a lovely walk in the sunlight of Provence during a dreary winter and have since watched it several times.  Each time I find it is a little, quirky gem of a film that delights me.  No nudity, no swearing, no uncomfortable sex scenes and witty, interesting, funny dialogue. Go figure...",1431129600,,1992,4.583098591549295

How could anything with Colin Firth as the romantic lead be this awful?  He was so wrong for the part of a sarcastic trickster who hates everyone and he wasn't funny at all. With his innate genteel sophistication and noble appearance, he sounded ridiculous saying the Woody Allen dialogue.  Emma Stone looked like a little girl with a big lisp and was totally annoying.  She looked young enough to be Firth's granddaughter, not his love interest.

6697234,3,B00O0292FI,"As a fan of several of the actors in this film, notably the oft unrecognized Simon McBurney and the easily identified Colin Firth, I decided to give it a go despite the fact I'm not very keen on Woody Allen films.  The odd thing about the film was not the part where we're supposed to believe Emma Stone and Colin Firth as potential love interests for each other, but the fact that the skeptic vs. the spiritualist is largely developed through characters giving speeches at one another.  There is not so much a sense of dialogue but rather talking at or to one another rather than with.  Firth as skeptic is perfectly cast.  He has the charm to pull it off along with the pessimism we've seen from him over the years.  McBurney as his apparent co-conspirator is underutilized, sadly, so when everything comes to a head, it's not a surprise or a shock,but almost a cheat.  The short run time for the film is to its advantage because one can only take so much being talked at in over-loud voices like everyone is trying to be overheard.  The plot is somewhat predictable and there are moments of whimsy.  Once the inevitable end occurs, though, it is almost a relief.

4. Stage Magician finds out that the whole thing was an elaborate ruse.

Equally hard to believe as the film under review, Magic In The Moonlight, attests to is the seemingly never-ending ways that Woody has played the staple Hollywood film boy-meets girl theme. And of course attached to that well-worn theme, unlike most Hollywood boy meets girl movies, you get a full ration of whatever Woody wants to philosophize about at any given moment. Here, and none too soon, is Woodys comedic defense of rationalism and science against the ever encroaching spread of faith-healers, fortune-tellers, drifters, grifters and midnight sifters trying like hell to set whatever tiny grasp we have on understanding our world back to the dark ages.

Enter Stanley (played by Colin Firth previously seen in this space being bewitched and bedeviled by Miss Elizabeth Barrett and later as the poor stuttering King George VII) who by night is an illusionist, you know, a magic tricks guys, amazing his incredulous 1920s Jazz Age audiences with his artistry under the name Wei Ling Soo but by day a super-rationalist who has made himself something of a cottage industry out of exposing fortune-tellers, spiritualist, and diviners as the charlatans they are. It is in that role that Stanley is brought into one such a fraudulent example by Howard, a fellow illusionist, you know a guy who conjures up magic tricks, who has been stumped by an America wisp-of-the-will young woman crystal-ball gazer, Sophie (played by fetching Emma Stone) you know somebody who speaks to the dead and stuff like that. This Sophie and her mother are working their act on a rich American widowed mother and her son ensconced in their villa in the south of France, you know the Riviera. The bait: letting the widowed mother speak to her late husband. The hook: have Sophie marry into the family and live in the lap of luxury forever after, or until at least 1929 (and maybe after depending on how wise that late husband was).

Stanley naturally is more than happy to help out his old buddy Howard, after all they started out as kids together conjuring up whatever kid illusionists conjure up. Once the duel between Stanley and Sophie begins you can get the first inkling that they may be adversaries but there is ever so slight a spark there as Stanley tries to move might and main to debunk Sophies various machinations. But he cannot, damn it he cannot, find any fault in her act. He thus begins to question his own super-rational everything can be explained and if it cannot now it will be by further scientific exploration way of looking at the world. A tell the world this wonderful fact via a press conference.

But then the plot thickens and he finds that Sophie and Howard have been in collusion, have played, well, played a little sophomoric trick on him to take him down a peg, to avenge Howards having to play second fiddle to the great Stanley. Of course all that rationalism versus charlatanism theme that has Woody Allen exercised in this film by having Stanley going on and on about the very real virtues of seeking rational explanations in the end plays second fiddle to that little spark between Stanley and Sophie we witnessed throughout the film. In the end they both were willing to throw over whatever was important to them before, her buying into the wealthy family by marrying that eligible son and he by being the king of the debunkers, in the name, well, of love. Maybe a little too heavy handed with the wry banter on the main theme but an enjoyable film for those who like their boy meets girl films with an intellectual twist. A twist which Woody has been providing for ever so long.",1426550400,2,3742,4.743471582181259

""In  your intellectual life, magic will always be hokum; in  your emotional life, magic can  be quite real (e.g., the chemistry felt between two people).""

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will find Colin Firth in this film playing Woody Allen. Not Firth playing ""the Woody Allen character,"" but Firth playing Woody Allen.

I've read loads of pages of Woody Allen interviews and watched many documentaries on Allen. And from what I've been able to learn from all of that, this's easily the closest Allen has ever come to creating a  portrayal of himself in one of his own movies. Definitely a first, of sorts.

The heart does not know from logic, as Woody likes to say, many times over. In regard to that, I think that if The Wood Man had made a logical choice for a marriage partner, that woman would probably have been some sort of combination of Simone de Beauvoir, Eleonora Duse, and a female version of Nietzsche.

Instead, Allen chose Soon-Yi, a woman who wasn't particularly philosophical or brainy and was more interested in teaching learning disabled kids than showing much interest in Allen's film career. Soon-Yi had a warm smile and a magic, of sorts, to banish, from time to time, the dark cloud that followed Allen wherever he seemed to go.

Woody Allen, the man with an insufficient denial mechanism (""we live in a godless, meaningless universe""), discovered that he needed to find refuge somewhere and that baseball and the Knicks and the treadmill and all those other neat little diversionary tricks weren't cutting the mustard. And he must've known, consciously or subconsciously, that marrying a combination of Simone de Beauvoir and Eleonora Duse and some sort of female version of Nietzsche wasn't going to divert his attention from the hell that is the cold reality that he manages to stare down much more often than most people.

So Colin Firth, as Woody Allen, instead turns to Emma Stone, as Soon-Yi. And herein lies another first for a Woody Allen film: A Hollywood ending. I never thought that I'd see a Hollywood ending in a Woody Allen film, but I think somewhere in the back of my mind, I believed that if Allen decided to give one of his films a Hollywood ending, HE WAS NOT GOING TO FOOL AROUND. The Wood Man would give you a Hollywood ending to top all Hollywood endings. And in this film, Colin Firth (i.e., Woody Allen) ends up with someone BETTER THAN the girl of his dreams. He ends up with an exquisite fit (i.e., Soon-Yi). That, my friend, is the Hollywood ending to top all Hollywood endings.",1426118400,,2683,5.086560364464693

The scenery is beautiful. It says filmed in France but if you did not know you would say it was California. A few scenes with close ups of Colin would have you thinking he was talking to himself other than the other person.

6697326,3,B00O0292FI,"For the 46th time, the viewers who came to see the latest Woody Allen's picture are greeted with his familiar calling card, the black screen with elegant white subtitles that is a portal to the new world created by the tireless workaholic whose motto is - no single year without a movie. This time, he takes us to Europe of the late 1920s, at the end of the short lull between two most devastating wars of the 20th century. After brief stop in Berlin, the plot moves to the luxurious villa on the seaside of French Riviera where the owners, their guests and neighbors are all excited about otherworldly and supernatural phenomena inexplicable by science.

Do Cassandra's and Sybil's really exist among us? Can they foresee the future and read the past, based on the mental images that are projected directly into their consciousness? Are they really a medium between the material and spiritual worlds? Famous circus magician, skeptic and atheist Stanley (Colin Firth) responds scornfully: ""No!"" And he is ready to expose one such Sybil, red- haired and green-eyed young American woman Sophie (Emma Stone). Acrimonious and sarcastic,Stanley has no doubts that he will immediately uncover the impostor, but to his utmost surprise he realizes that Sophie knows his hidden secrets, weaknesses, regrets and unfulfilled dreams he never admitted to anyone. Maybe, unknown and hidden forces exist after all?

The picture is beautiful to look at. Shot by Darius Khondji, who has worked on three Allen's films of lately, the French Riviera arises from a dream, wrapped in beauty, serenity and luxury. The problem was, first and foremost, a colorless screenplay which subject Allen might have borrowed from one of his recent London pictures. There is nothing wrong with re-using one's own ideas, and it was Allen who once said: ""Steal from the best"". But he wrote the script for Magic in the Moonlight without a drop of inspiration or magic. Easily predictable movie drags in the middle hoping for magic to move it towards the final black screen with the white letters adding up to the word ""End"". What could have been charming romantic period piece/comedy turned bland, devoid of originality and sadly did not allow talented actors Marcia Gay Harden and Jackie Weaver to shine in the supporting roles. This is unfortunate because in Allen's movies even inanimate objects can give exciting performance.

Another problem was director's decision to make a romantic comedy, which, by definition, must end with the close-up of two heroes either lost to the world in an endless kiss or looking into each other's eyes with tenderness that softly melts the screen. Stanley and Sophie share no spark, no ""chemistry"" that would make the viewers believe in the possibility of romance developing between them. Much more ""chemistry"" has arisen between Sophie and pretty dresses in the fashion of the late 1920s that were created for her by the talented costume designers. One of the cheerful dresses, white with a big red collar, clings to her gently, hugging her slender figure and highlighting unusual shade of her red hair. And perky black beret, holding on her pretty head at an impossible angle, may well qualify for an Oscar for best supporting role.

Perhaps, none of the modern actors can play a cocky and arrogant English snob better than Colin Firth what he has proved repeatedly. This time, though, he went so deeply into the character that when he had to switch to falling in love mood, the transition was sharp, sudden and not convincing.

With all this said, even pedestrian Woody Allen comedy is more elegant, polished and pleasant than most of the rom-coms produced by the big studios but vagueness, haste and not plausible final act weakened the magic of moonlight. It lacks the enchantment and spell of Paris at midnight that Allen created with light touch and inspiration three years ago.",1424736000,6,3884,4.978428351309708

6697371,2,B00O0292FI,"Not a bad premise/film on one level - the cynic vs. the believer.  Of course, Woody is free to revel in his bleak, dreary cynicism.  No matter what your philosophy, it was hard not to want to strangle the Colin Firth character and his relentless negativity.  If you were at all on the fence, he will send you leaping over to the side of magic and faith so you can at least lighten up, enjoy yourself, and actually be able to smile once in a while.

Woody could argue that he chose Colin Firth because on many levels his character is an older version of the Mr. Darcy character from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, so Colin is perfect.  Star returns to his greatest role. What Woody somehow misses, due to his apparent and obvious blind spot, is how Firth's character straddles the fine line of pedophilia and pulls a Soon Yi on the watcher of this film.  After all that Woody has been through, you would think that his own borderline criminality would not be paraded on the big screen for all to see.  Embarrassing.",1423958400,,1018,4.440860215053763

6697376,4,B00O0292FI,"I bought the Blu Ray set, but I should have thought before I bought. I had all these great plans to see this one at the movies. I should have wondered why it had a limited engagement run and had been yanked out of the theaters in the area before it even played in any area theaters within a twenty mile radius of my home. Hey, i don't live in farm country.
This is a cute romantic comedy.  Stanley (Colin Firth) is a magician and sceptic who is trying to prove that Sophie (Emma Stone) is a charlatan as well as a popular psychic. After meeting they tramp through France and something is definitely happening. However, as any movie goer knows it may be magic or more likely the incredible pull of romance.
I thought the two main characters played well against one another and had chemistry, in fact a lot of it.
The exterior shots of France just added to all the magic. It was enough to have me packing my bag. The cinematography was great. The vintage music added to this period piece and is one of those little elements that distinguish this as a Woody Allen movie. Ditto for the set designs and costumes. I absolutely loved it all.
The rub to all of this despite a decent script, good acting, and everything else is it was merely good but not great. It didn't glue me to my seat or ellicit deep emotional feelings when it appeared that Stanley and Sophie were going in different directions in their uncertain universe. It didn't completely work for me and I suspect there was something missing in the script or character development. My problem is I can't even figure out what might have elevated or fixed this movie.
Do there you have it. Put everything together and this is a 4* movie that has beautiful pieces that don't completely equate to one terrific whole. I think this explains the limited/non-existant theatrical run.
Definitely Woody Allen smart, but not great.",1423526400,,1875,4.530973451327434

6697397,4,B00O0292FI,"This reminds me of Allen's ""Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"" which he made with Mia Farrow decades ago. It too was set in the early twentieth century and dealt with magical goings on. The difference here is that Allen has set this in the Spiritualist movement. That movement dealt in contacts with the spirit world using a medium, especially during seances. As more and more of these were proven fraudulent, the movement began to die out.

Emma Stone plays a spiritual medium in 1928. Colin Firth plays a magician (illusionist) who does not believe in Spiritualism and specializes in exposing them as frauds. This is what Harry Houdini used to do and I'm sure Houdini's history inspired Allen.

Firth is called in to expose her while she is summering with a family in need of her services in Provence, France. Although Emma may be genuine, her scheming mother (Marsha Gay Harden) is a fraud out for the cash through and through. I love it when Harden plays these underhanded women.

This is thus one of Allen's lighter movies, just as ""Sex Comedy"" was. With his ensemble cast he has great scenes throughout. There is a psychiatrist who positively delights in Firth because he's such a depressive.

One aspect Allen puts in a great deal of his work is the May-December couple. That is true in this film. Colin Firth is 55 and Emma Stone is 27. That is a 28 year age difference. Allen has made it that extreme in only a few of his movies. In many of his more recent movies he has used more realistic age gaps. I prefer it when he does't use these extreme gaps. But admittedly Colin Firth is appealing at any age.

So I have a few quibbles with this film but overall it is an enjoyable romantic comedy.",1422403200,,1696,4.547540983606558

She ends up charming the pessimistic magician and one of those love-hate relationships develop.  It moves along nicely, but about two thirds of the way through feels like the story is being stretched to fill the length of the movie.  Some may feel bored at this point, but it does get back on track and moves towards the expected ending.  The storyline was romantic enough, but there wasn't much of a romantic feel (or magic) between the two leads. They did do a good job in their roles though.

Very much a downer of a film. Also, quite slow, and I'm okay with slower films if they actually have good character development, which this lacked.

6697407,2,B00O0292FI,"I guess any film Woody Allen writes and directs is just pure gold to some people. Magic is the Moonlight gets positive reviews from about 50% of viewers. The rest of viewers are evidently not so effusive about what is a slow-paced, somewhat annoying, and less than original film.
  Magic in the Moonlight is not very original--in fact, if you've seen My Fair Lady/Pygmalion you've seen the great work that is the basis for this less-than stellar film. The genius in Magic in the Moonlight is George Bernard Shaw, not Woody Allen.
  In Pygmalion, an egocentric, over-the-top, witty bachelor in love with science and reason, takes on a project to create a lady from a girl from the poor side of town. In Woody's film, we have a egocentric, over-the-top, witty bachelor in love with science and reason who takes as a project to expose a pretty young medium from modest circumstances as a fraud. In both cases, the haughty bachelor comes to care for the young woman and vice versa. In  both cases, the bachelor is very attached to an older woman who makes wry comments and leads the bachelor into appreciating the young woman and behaving himself somewhat (In Shaw's work it is Henry Higgin's mother. in Woody's work, it is a wise Aunt). In Pygmalion/My Fair Lady, the attractive girl from the wrong side of the tracks is compulsively wooed by an upper class/rich milksop (Freddy); In Magic in the Moonlight, the attractive girl from the wrong side of the tracks is compulsively wooed by an upperclass/rich milksop.
  The parallels between Pygmalion/My Fair Lady and Magic in the Moonnlight are too many to be accidental. Woody Allen may be a genius, but this film is highly derivative. Take Pygmalion and overlay it with the trappings of mediums and magicians and the result is Magic in the Moonlight, a tedious, lightweight version of George Bernard Shaw's sparkling and engaging Pygmalion.",1421971200,2,1888,4.84472049689441

The movie is kinda bold for liberal Hollywood. I mean a movie whose premise is about Christian revival? Wow. But the problem is that they were not bold enough. Instead the liberals held back a good idea just to the point of rendering it almost chaos. I mean why use the ""occult"" as the ""spirituality""? Why not just plain ol Christianity? The occult is the antithesis of Christianity. Hence my good/bad critique. It could have been so much more. Oh well. We are used to such disappointments by Hollywood.

Anyway, the idea that a man uses magic to fool people while running around trying to expose the frauds is too good of a point to condemn this entire movie I mean the guy was fooled into waking up to love, life, and God by one of his crusades. Again, this movie could have been so much more.",1421280000,,932,4.381502890173411
6697424,5,B00O0292FI,"I hadn't even heard about this movie until I happened to be looking at my Amazon recommendations today.  I first looked to see if it was playing anywhere close to where I live.  It wasn't, although the film came out in December.  So I couldn't wait!  I happened to see it in a local store and bought it.  Glad I did!

This relatively short Woody Allen film stars Colin Firth and Emma Stone as the main characters.  Firth plays Stanley Crawford, a magician who is asked by a friend to meet a young woman, Sophie Baker(Stone)  who claims to be a spiritualist. The friend also is a magician and has been stumped---he's convinced the woman is the real deal.  Problem is she's conjuring up the sprit of the deceased husband of a very rich widow and of course she has a handsome son who is smitten with this charming clairvoyant.  So Stanley without meeting Sophie is already convinced that she is a fraud and that her mother, played by Marcia Gay Harden is probably robbing the family of their jewels while Sophie is calling up the dead father!

This story takes place in 1928 so there's a lot of background music of the period complete with ukulele and crooning by the young would-be lover of Sophie.  Actually much of the music is good and of the 20s vintage with some Beethoven thrown in!  The scenery is of the South of France where all of this conjuring, touring, and romance is taking place.

In trying to figure out Sophie's persona and her constant ""vibes"" Stanley becomes aware that he is not so pessimistic, practical and is really able to relax and enjoy life.  He discover that life is unpredictable and nothing is certain and that one can't always be sure of anything.  He finally recognizes Sophie as a positive influence in his otherwise dull existence.

The acting in this movie was delightful.  Eileen Atkins as Stanley's Aunt Vanessa was just precious.  A very wise and introspective woman who herself experienced heartbreak has a way of persuading Stanley that sometimes being practical doesn't always make one content.  She encourages him to explore his feelings and to see where it leads him.  He eventually discovers that Sophie isn't all that she seems in more ways than one!  A light fresh romantic film that will bring a smile to all!",1421193600,3,2254,4.638888888888889

One nice thing was that, except for a scene with a psychoanalyst, it wasn't another WA movie where everyone was directed to rant like WA...in that sense, I (I'm sure controversially) like it better than Midnight in Paris, where even Rachel McAdams sounds like him.

6697432,4,B00O0292FI,"In Woody Allen's 2014 annual European set film, he goes back in time to the Roaring `20's.  Colin Firth plays Stanley Crawford who is a famous magician who goes by the name and disguise of Wei Ling Soo.  Stanley is approached by his good friend and fellow magician, Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to go to England and help him expose a supposed medium who he believes is hoodwinking the wealthy Catledge family into investing a fortune into an organization that promotes supernatural contact with the deceased.

Stanley agrees, but like Howard, has a hard time finding the secrets.  In fact, he becomes convinced that the young American, Sophie (Emma Stone) is the real deal after she advances secrets about himself.  Marcia Gay Harden plays Sophie's mother, but really doesn't have much to do.  Jacki Weaver plays Grace Catledge, the widow who is trying to contact her late husband.  Hamish Linklater plays Brice Catledge, the playboy son who is smitten with Sophie and courts her with song and ukulele.

This is lightweight stuff to be sure, but Allen offers a fine script and compelling characters to make it enjoyable.  Some of the best scenes are with Stanley and his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins) who lives near the Catledge's.  In one particular scene, Stanley argues with himself as to whether he should pursue Sophie.  Vanessa provides one liners that bounce back Stanley's own arguments.  It's funny and sweet.  Granted, we know all is not what it seems but I won't spoil the Agatha Christie-like reveal.  To be sure, this isn't one of Allen's masterpieces or even one of his best.  But I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially to Allen's fans.

The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The technicians do a serviceable job transferring the film to the digital format.  The filmmakers chose a light hazy, sepia tone to the picture and it is nicely replicated here.  Close-ups are particularly good with fine detail and excellent skin tones consistent with the overall limitations.  Black levels are generally good.  Light grain can be seen throughout.  I was a little surprised to see a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track with this movie.  I seem to remember Allen almost always goes with stereo.  In any case the audio is very good, although the surrounds are mostly in play with the musical score and an early scene when Sophie and Stanley get caught in a thunderstorm.  The dialog centric movie is very clear with most of the audio coming from the center speaker.  The package includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include a piece called ""Behind the Magic"" and another ""On the Red Carpet"" as well as a trailer.",1421107200,,2686,4.846153846153846

Of course the stories are also typically about the elite class. In this one its about their involvement with occult mediums and magic. But there is also a mythological storyline underneath, running parallel for those who can recognize it. Another aspect of a typical Allen film is always a great cast of distinguished actors and this does not disappoint.

Obviously, Mr. Allen still thinks he some kind of guru and his 'throngs' of admirers are breathless waiting for his next brilliant analysis  of  life's key issues. Unfortunately, Allen's cuteness and superficiality continues to be but lifeless,contrived, self-serving versions of relationships, life's purposes, and how actual people think and act in the actual real world of true emotion and feelings.

Instead of simply discovering that the world does, indeed, hold someone with whom he wants to spend his life, the main character is forced to choose between the woman who matches his abilities and philosophy of life, or the woman with an exceptionally pretty-smile-nice-laugh-great-body combination.

Basically it's all just window dressing on the tired old trope of dad beds girl his daughter's age. That's all this is.

Watching Woody Allen, I always bear in mind that he is a Neil Simon, not a Clint Eastwood.  His films are more like plays, and he faithfully sets forth theme and premise in the first few scenes.  Then I just sit back and watch it unfold beautifully.  It's no wonder the best talent works with Mr. Allen....his love for them beams from each scene.  Perhaps he should watch his own films more closely, he may come to believe that such talent is no accident.

And in the end, we hear an obtuse justification as to why the older man should have the younger woman.  Given certain histories here, it just went creepy.

(This would not have happened in the 1920's where dancing was a regular part of life and the vast majority of people made sure they knew how to dance well, or they would have been ridiculed off the dance floor) Not sure why Woody let that go, thought he might have insisted on some dancing lessons for the group prior to filming, or maybe he assumed they knew a little about ballroom dance and was shocked at the results?",1419638400,,770,4.546762589928058

6697569,3,B00O0292FI,"Like the majority of reviewers, I find the film enjoyable.  Unlike other reviewers, I'm doing to go out on a limb and say that what keeps the film from being great instead of just good enough is the casting.  Hard to believe, but Colin Firth does not nail the part as a romantic lead.  While he gives his usual great performance while playing the magician, as the man behind the magic.  Nevertheless, Mr. Firth does appear to try to fall in love.

On the other hand, Emma Stone's performance is lazy throughout the film. There's not a glimmer of hope for her performance.  Neither perfect period costuming nor the glorious south of France compensates for her strolling through the film.  The result is that Emma Stone is easy to look at but not an actress whose performance is worth watching.

However, a performance well worth watching over and over again is given by Eileen Atkins. That woman could have worn a black polyester pant-suit from the mid-1970s and lived in a densely populated urban area and her performance set in the south of France in the 20s would still sparkle.  Simon McBurney gives a performance similar to Ms. Atkins's in bringing life to his part. No one in the film is as good as Eileen Atkins, but I would cast Simon Mc Burney again for the role he played.  Needless to say, I wouldn't give any one else in the film a second reading, much less a paid position.",1419465600,5,1385,4.526104417670683

6697587,2,B00O0292FI,"Some said Delightful, and utterly forgettable. Amen.
The plot has been described in detail, so here's my take on the film's presentation.

Sumptuous, almost over done settings, like Downton Abbey headed for a diabetic seizure. Beautiful cinematography, costumes, lighting, acting, great foley work without being overbearing or obvious. A few things looked obviously green screened which was surprising for a romantic comedy. With Woody Allen, who knows, keeping it theatrical and all that, letting you know maybe that it IS a movie after all, or just some cheezy production moments.

I'll draw a comparison. ""Beyond the Sea"". The lead is too old, the muse is too young, but the music, dancing, and deceptively simple story line make BTS work somehow. There is so much going on you can suspend disbelief for a while and enjoy the show. In ""Magic in the Moonlight"" the lead is too old, the muse is too young, and there are no distractions keeping you from wondering why Colin Firth is falling in love with his daughter. It takes almost the entire movie to come to light, and I was thinking, OK, maybe it will work out another way because he's so...old. Old fashioned, old behaving...just...old. And he's not hooking in, at least on the surface, until the very end, so there's very little comedy OR romance. No real gender tension, just disdain for the muse's current love life, and no real interest in his own. A Woody Allen Relationship Nerd, in caps.

Some might say to me ""That sounds like an age thing with you, buddy, you're just jealous"". No, actually I'm a little older than Mr. Firth myself and have no interest in any of my daughter's friends. Plus I love a good romantic comedy, regardless of the entry age limit, young or old, so long as it's viable somehow. This one just didn't work for me, but it's an OK way to kill a Sunday afternoon while you fold clothes.

A very well acted, well directed, well shot, miscast bit of fluff with no one to root for, no one to despise, no loving couple to throw flowers or rice or even believe in happily ever afters for. But it sure looked good!",1419206400,7,2093,4.648648648648648

6697593,2,B00O0292FI,"Allen's prolific output guarantees that he will produce a dud at least once in a while - this is one of them.  Here, he's tackling one of the great questions of philosophy - whether phenomena are entirely explained through materialism, or if the supernatural also plays a part.  The debate is embodied by the two main characters; a professional magician and a psychic.  The magician is an illusionist, who cuts people in half, moves instantly from place to place, and makes an elephant disappear, but despite his very convincing legerdemain, there is no question that his act is a ""trick,"" albeit one that the audience can't figure out.  The psychic, in contrast, claims to be ""the real thing,"" obtaining knowledge through her claimed connection with the spirit world.

Through it all we are shown (or rather, told; Allen here violates the first commandment of drama:  ""show, don't tell"") how belief in the afterlife and the supernatural can be a great comfort to people; that the illusion is enticing even if not ""true.""  Ultimately, it doesn't even matter whether it's true or not.  These are the Big Issues, the Ineffable Concepts, the Great Imponderables of life, played out by wealthy and beautiful people on an estate in southern France in the late 1920s, in the last hours before everything went to hell and the Great Depression and World War Two rendered these questions irrelevant.

The problem is that the film is all talk and no action, with no chemistry between any of the actors.  Colin Firth as the magician is all bluster and bravado, Emma Stone as the psychic barely manages to phone it in, and Hamish Linklater as the wealthy heir who falls in love with her, gives a performance so abysmally awful that it made me reconsider my decision to not go into acting - heck, if he can do it, anyone can.  Allen is so intent on getting his philosophical points across, he forgot to edit the script.  This film would have been far more effective as a documentary, with short interviews of people like Richard Dawkins and John Edward.  It's not as if anything has changed since the days of seances with their table rappings and floating candles; today we have near-death experiences where people go to heaven and meet Jesus, but it's the same idea.

There is a nice scene in an astronomical observatory that is conveniently left open for people to shelter themselves from the rain - after all, it's only a few million dollars worth of precision optical equipment; who cares if anyone can just wander in there whenever they feel like it and open the dome, or take a nap?  Other than that, ""Magic in the Moonlight"" can only be recommended for Allen completists.",1419120000,2,2665,4.750542299349241

6697609,3,B00O0292FI,"""You came to unmask her and she's unmasked you."" Stanley (Firth) is a magician who has a very cynical view of the world and is a great debunker of psychics. When an old friend shows up and tells him of Sophie (Stone), a psychic he believes is real, he asks Stanley to meet her. What starts out as a simple debunking becomes something much more complicated. I have said for years that I am not a Woody Allen fan. In the last few years I have begun to change my mind about that. I have really enjoyed Blue Jasmine, Whatever Works, Midnight In Paris and while this isn't as good as those this is still a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. Firth and Stone have great chemistry and the movie has a perfect blend of comedy and drama. There is not the usual neurotic character like in most Allen movies but Firth does have a bit of snark which he plays off perfectly. The best part of this movie is that is stays one step ahead of you. Just when you think you know what is going on you are thrown off track. I really enjoy movies like that.

6697617,4,B00O0292FI,"I had a chance to see this film in the theater this summer and liked (not quite loved) it. Im a big Woody fan and this was a bit different than some of his.  I also like Colin Firth. The plot does have a few twists and turns and I hope other reviewers don't provide spoilers in describing the film. Honestly I wasn't sure what would happen in the end and it caught me by surprise.

This week I was provided with a screener by the film studio and so this review is based on the Bluray Combo pack. The image on my flat screen 1080 TV was fine and the French countryside where it was filmed lo0oked gorgeous.

There are two Bonus Features, plus the theatrical trailer, on the BD (and I think the DVD too). First is a featurette  Behind The Magic which runs 11 minutes and features comments from actors Colin Firth, Jacki Weaver and Hamish Linklater.  Allen is rarely in these featurettes and is not here. The lead actress Emma Stone (charming in the film) is not here either. The first section has the three actors discussing spiritualism (the subject of the film) and then moving on to complimenting each other. There are a few brief scenes included. The short includes spoilers so you shouldnt watch before playing the film.

The second Bonus is On The Red Carpet at the Los Angeles Premiere. This runs 2:45 and includes a few more of the cast (but no Allen or Stone) and even critic Leonard Maltin appears on the Carpet (why??).  This bonus won't add anything to understanding the film.

So, while not Woodys best, I did enjoy this  even twice.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6697620,2,B00O0292FI,"In 1930's England a magician who has a side hobby in exposing fake mediums is brought to a French estate to unmask the fakery of an American medium (Emma Stone) whose tricks his magician friend couldn't see through.  Colin Forth and Emma Stone are both charming actors but they are stuck with some painfully weak material here.

Magic in the Moonlight is more of a light romantic drama than a comedy.  Woody Allen doesn't seem much interested in humor--or pacing or plotting.  It's extremely obvious that Emma Stone is pulling the wool over Colin Firth's eyes and once you come to that conclusion there's only one way she could be doing it, leaving very little in the way of dramatic interest.  I kept hoping there was more to Magic in the Moonlight than there seemed to be but Woody Allen literally has nothing up his sleeve.  With this premise and cast the movie could have been a fun screwball comedy along the lines of The Lady Eve but instead Allen has delivered a dull older man/younger woman romantic fantasy (in Allen's world the older man's superior culture and education always compensates for the woman's youth) laced with heavy-handed dialogue forcing Allen's atheistic views down the audiences throats.  I don't have a problem with the views themselves, but who wants to feel like they're being lectured to in what is supposed to be a light-hearted romantic comedy?

Magic in the Moonlight is an unfortunate misfire but Colin Firth and Emma Stone manage to make it halfway bearable.  Unfortunately there appears to be no real belief in romance or magic in Woody Allen's heart so what should be charming and light ends up cynical and dull.",1416700800,9,1651,4.785211267605634
