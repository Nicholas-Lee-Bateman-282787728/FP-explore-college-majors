4572975,3,B0055CAIK0,Bought this DVD set before a trip to Israel and found only a couple of the DVDs truly relevant.  Quality is also spotty; some material/graphics quite dated.,1360022400,5,156,4.777777777777778
4572976,5,B0055CAIK0,The best videos ever put out.  Just can't stop watching them & others that have borrowed them feel the same way & say they're great.  Really lets one feel like you know more about the areas.,1358640000,8,190,4.25

4572978,4,B0055CAIK0,"Good production and presentation of six disc set of Christian topics, ranging from the Holy Land, to as diverse as St. Paul and Helena's first pilgrimage. Strongly recommended for all Christians and non Christians, who want an insight into Christianity. Video scenes were well documented and commentaries easy to follow. The only criticism I have, is that there were many short clippings where they should be elaborated. For instance, the disc on the Holy Land, was too short and many more sacred sites were not included. Overall, this set is well worth buying and very educational.",1331251200,15,582,5.072916666666667
