8416538,5,B004562NNC,"I really enjoyed these segments highlighting Daytona's early years throughout the ""Grand National"" era. This DVD has some of my favorites like Richard Petty, Fred Lorenzen & Fireball Roberts who became legends before I was even born. The narration and quality of footage is excellent & I'm thrilled I found this DVD. It's a great buy.",1423353600,,334,4.982142857142857
