6761312,4,B00OU4MUD2,"Mill Creek Entertainment gives children of the 1980s and their offspring a double dose of sci-fi fun with the Krull / Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone Combo DVD release. Krull recently had its Blu-ray debut. Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone hasn't seen the light of day since hitting DVD back in 2001. The two movies put together in one package is a great way for genre fans to pick them up.

I recently reviewed the Krull Blu-ray when it was released through Mill Creek Entertainment. If you're interested, you can read my review right here. In a nutshell, its an epic heros journey that mixes together Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. However, modern audiences might find its pacing a bit slow in places.

Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone is a blend of a couple different influences on science fiction flicks of the 1980s. Imagine if a reluctant hero-for-hire in the vein of Han Solo traveled to a planet where the inhabitants live in a society that resembled the dystopian world of The Road Warrior. It comes complete with scavengers, mutants, and a makeshift city whose citizens enjoy watching people fight for their lives in a deadly maze. It all sounds a little familiar, eh? It also sounds like a lot of fun!

In the year 2136, Wolff (Peter Strauss), a wily salvage pilot and intergalactic bounty hunter, answers a distress signal on Terra Eleven. Agreeing to pick up three women who've been shipwrecked, he lands on the planet only to discover they've been kidnapped. Following their trail, Wolff soon encounters Niki (Molly Ringwald), a spunky orphan who agrees to guide him across the Forbidden Zone, a vast wasteland populated by plague-infested mutants. After many battles, Wolff and Niki finally reach the lair of Overdog (Michael Ironside), the planet's half-man / half-machine ruler. Discovering the women are held captive in Overdog's slave pens, Wolff's rescue mission finally begins.

Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone was originally released during the 3-D craze of the early 1980s. Jaws 3-D, Friday the 13th, Part 3-D, and Amityville 3-D are other movies which are more identifiable from this era. The film is presented in 2-D on DVD, but you can definitely tell where the 3-D wouldve played a part at times.

The cast of Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone was made up of some familiar 1980s faces. Peter Strauss is known for his many roles in television shows and movies. Ernie Hudson is best known for his character Winston Zeddemore in Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. When the movie came out in 1983, Molly Ringwalds only major parts were in Diffrent Strokes and The Facts of Life. She comes off as an annoying tag-along here until the end of the film, where she makes an attempt at redeeming herself by facing down her fear and working hard to stay alive. Michael Ironside fully embraced his role as the cyborg tyrant Overdog.

Both Krull and Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone are rated PG. Krull features mild violence and gore, and frightening / intense sequences. Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone includes mild violence and gore, profanity, and frightening / intense scenes. One of the bat creatures in the film is shown topless, but its not known whether the monster is male or female. Theres definitely nothing sexy about the scene.

Krull / Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone Sci-Fi Double Feature is a bare-bones release. There aren't any special features to be found. Most fans of the films won't even care. Its the first time either one has been available in over 10 years.

Newer viewers might find the Krull / Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone Sci-Fi Double Feature a bit heavy on the cheese and slow in stride. The special effects are all practical as well. Its nice to see all the hard work the crew put into the visual look of the film. If you love the original Star Wars, then youll no doubt enjoy these two offerings from Mill Creek Entertainment. Watch them through the eyes of a 10 year old in 1983 and everything will be fine.",1421625600,11,4081,4.88728323699422
6761313,4,B00OU4MUD2,"I bought this to get Spacehunter, since the old Spacehunter DVD discs from the 2001 release go for outrageous amounts on secondary market. Movie as great as I remembered (maybe even better), but I do wish the video quality was better. There are 2 features on one disc, and it shows in the barely-above VHS-grade video. Most of it is fine, comparable to my memories of watching on cable TV years ago, but a couple scenes have a lot of graininess, and other scenes are too dark (possibly where the original theatrical release had some 3D scenes?). Glad to be able to watch Spacehunter again, but also glad I only paid $6 for this release.",1421452800,16,636,4.539130434782609

These are two of the ""B""EE-est you can find. The only thing I DON'T like about this particular DVD, there are no chapter/scene select options so it's like popping in a VHS tape, except for, like, fast forwarding to it, you have no way to start in the middle or just watch the credits. You pop it in, there's a screen where you can select which movie you want to watch & that's it, no other options...can't expect much for the price though :)",1465776000,2,570,4.386792452830188

Not even a good memory at that.. I can see that ugly, mechanical torso-dude in my thoughts right now.. that and a hollowed out spaceship thing with fat white blob looking things that kinda scared me way back then.

 I didn't even know it was Michael Ironsides until ten minutes ago when I read the information on Amazon... I am not sure if I would enjoy these movies now...

6761462,4,B00OU4MUD2,"I mostly bought this for Spacehunter, which I remember seeing in the theater in 3D and is a cheesy Sci-Fi flick starring  Peter Strauss, Molly Ringwald, Ernie Hudson and Michael Ironside.  After the ship they were traveling on is blown up, three women manage to survive in an escape pod only to be stranded on a planet where a fatal disease has mutated the population and turned them into life energy sucking vampires. (for want of a better term)  Wolff, Peter Strauss's character, is a bounty hunter who wants (read, desperately needs) the money he'd receive for rescuing them.  Along the way he meets Niki, an annoying Earther and the last of a medical expedition, and Ernie Hudson's character, Washington, who worked with Wolff in the past. Together they try to rescue the three women, with cheesy not-so-special effects and some really atrocious, dare I call it acting, along the way.
Krull is a sword and sorcery story starring Ken Marshall, Lysette Anthony, Freddie Jones and  Liam Neeson, about a group trying to stop the invading ""slayers"" from the Black Fortress.  It is a cheesy but somewhat entertaining bit of fluff.",1455580800,3,1128,4.87958115183246

Both movies are on one DVD, but that doesn't seem to detract from the film quality. They both look about like I remember them.

6761487,1,B00OU4MUD2,"This review is really about this release and not necessarily about the movies themselves. The movies are mostly what you'd expect them to be: silly somewhat boring campy old sci-fi films. Nothing too remarkable. But mainly just writing this review to warn people to avoid anything released by Mill Creek if possible. Mill Creek is a cheep junk company that never puts any regard to the release of quality products, often releasing cheap versions of movies or shows with little concern for remastering or DVD functionality in general. Although this particular DVD release has decent enough picture, it has no subtitles or captions whatsoever! I mean none! Not even from an antenna! The problem is that often when watching a movie like this, the dialogue can be sooooo darn difficult to hear, you need to turn the sound up really high, then some explosion occurs or a music score will start playing, and it will suddenly cause the volume on the TV to jump to severe loudness!! And you're left needing to shuffle the volume up and down continuously! Some type of captions or subtitles would have helped with this.  Afterward, when I noticed this DVD was released by Mill Creek, I understood.

Now that I've viewed these two movies, I""m going to give them away and try to get versions of them released by companies that have more regard for quality control than does Mill Creek. Mill Creek is only a company you should buy from as a last resort, only if there are no other choices. I wish I had paid better attention to this detail when I purchased this product. Hopefully I will be more alert in the future.",1437696000,,1604,4.684397163120567

6761494,4,B00OU4MUD2,"Ya know - I am the right age but oddly enough I never saw Spacehunter back when it was new. Therefore I was expecting it to be a terrible Star Wars/Mad Max ripoff... but I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a fun popcorn movie. Light while not decending into camp. Performances are good ...and while the film is a product of a post Star Wars/post Mad Max 80's world it isn't overly derivitive of either and has a fun aesthetic... really a fun movie with decent SFX that doesn't take itself too seriously. Very pleasantly surprised. ...I think I previously reviewed standalove DVD of Krull... decent film, great score, enjoyable and worth a look",1435190400,,648,4.643478260869565

6761496,5,B00OU4MUD2,"Excellent double-pairing of semi obscure 80's sci-fi hits. KRULL takes a nod from Conan, a nod from Star Wars, and turns it into an ever-treshing cacophany of violence, pre-computer effects, and unmitigated adventure. SPACEHUNTER is a fine follow-up, with similar influences and a nearly as effective end result.
Far better than watching Season 4 of Friends.",1434499200,,358,5.410714285714286
