8374439,4,B002MZZTXE,"[THE MONOCLE - (1964) - French, dubbed in English - Fullscreen presentation] In this third installment, all of which starred director Jean-Pierre Mellville regular Paul Meurisse as Major Theobald Dromar a.k.a. 'The Monocle', a fey secret agent who wears a monocle (hence the nickname) and cultivates an array of other quirky mannerisms, the Major is sent to Hong Kong to track down the leader of an Asian cult that sabotages nuclear facilities around the world in hopes of stirring up a war between the superpowers as retribution for the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Once there, he runs into another agent for the British (Barbara Steele), gets partnered with an aging American Karate expert and a French ex-patriot who shelters them in the Chinese-held section of Hong Kong. From there, it's off to Macau for some opium-smoking, gunplay, explosions, double-crossings, exotic locales, Asian spies dressed like they were in 'Casablanca', several plots that go awry, a few fistfights, a drugged dinner that culminates in a hilarious fight scene parody from 'West Side Story', a kidnapping, more gunplay and a concluding car-led cavalry chase led by the Brits and crafted by Major Dromar. Voil.

The French have their own unique spin with the spy film genre (among other things) and this must be among the most peculiar spy films of the 60's. The dialogue delivered by Paul Meurisse is smug, sarcastic, witty and droll, there's some physical comedy that even when exaggerated, doesn't grate on my nerves the way most slapstick does. Major Dromar is exceptionally successful in his work while putting up with vulgar heathens on both sides of the law that surround him while acting like he's wearily placating both parties, yet his agenda is entirely his own - he HAD to be the role model for the Peter Sellers character in the Inspector Clouseau / 'Pink Panther' series, only more clever. There's even a scene where Lino Ventura walks into their apartment, picks up a parcel and leaves without uttering a word (Why? - Ventura was already well-known for his roles in Melville's superb crime dramas as well). It's a very bizarre little film that starts off slow but delivers a payoff to those who stick around for the humorous ending that calls back a line the Major stated earlier in the film - ""The more I see the Chinese, the more similarities I see they have with we French"".

A strange but over-qualified cast adds much to the simple storyline but extremely eccentric yet delicious humor and adequate action served up in this Asian-based, MSG-overloaded Eurospy entry featuring 'The Monocle'- see what I'm saying?",1305590400,6,2623,5.0
