In many ways they lead a very asad life.",1218240000,3,85,4.0588235294117645
3466583,5,B0009PEWMS,"This story was so sad... I did research on those quints and saw that it was even sadder than the way it was portrayed in the movie. It makes you so angry at the government! you wonder what would have happened if these quintuplets were born in 2008. well, their and their family's life would have been much better and more private. everyone would just think ""well, she prolly took fertility drugz...""",1206316800,,399,4.555555555555555
3466584,3,B0009PEWMS,This is a fascinating film for the fact that the quints were not created by fertility drugs but entirely by nature.  Even more fascinating is the fact that the Canadian government behaved shamefully by allowing the doctor who assisted at their births to remove them from the custody of their parents and siblings.  His exploitation of the babies was fully supported by the government.  Good performances by Roy Dupuis (when is he not good) and Celine Bonnier.  Judith Doran,1189728000,8,473,4.949367088607595

8279398,5,B0009PEWMS,This is a very good true story miniserie about the Dionne babies. The actors are very good. A must see,1395878400,2,102,4.15
8279399,5,B0009PEWMS,"Such a tragic story..
I first saw this movie on tv when I was a little girl. I only remember bits and pieces of it, but I knew I wanted to see it again. It's still just as sad. The actors were all great. Everyone really did justice to their roles. The only thing I do not like about this movie is the inconsistent time logging. They tell you the dates maybe once or twice at the beginning, but you're kind of left guessing the rest of the time- how long they were apart from their family, milestones, etc. All I know it, when is, I am very grateful to have been born in a time when multiple births aren't so uncommon that people would be willing to snatch me away from my parents & siblings.",1388707200,,691,4.088235294117647
8279400,5,B0009PEWMS,"I got the tapes in good condition.  Don't know how they found two sets of triplets to look so much alike.  Sad story, but I liked it very much anyway.",1358812800,2,150,3.966666666666667
8279401,5,B0009PEWMS,This sad story is in the 1930s in the canada during the depression. A time when people where desperate and looking for hope. When the Dionne sisters where born. After being ripped from there devoted mother they where put into the hand of Dr Defeo a family GP. This movie shows the pain and desperate plight of the parents and the shameful money making public display that the government and Defoe placed onto these little girls. Never before has a story touched the world like this one and the movie greatly does it justice. Wonderful acting and a must see for the whole family.,1354579200,5,578,4.5673076923076925
8279402,5,B0009PEWMS,I have been looking every where for this and finally found it. Its awesome. I recommend it to all.,1231200000,,98,4.2105263157894735
