3086478,3,B0012DT2F8,"This is an OK little travelogue video, but doesn't explain that one can't go in Antelope Canyon and just wander around. Because it is on Navajo land, the Navajo control entry and everyone is accompanied by a Navajo guide. The extended photographer's tour is better (and more expensive), and allows for more time in the canyon, but in the summer when the crowds are intense, that matters very little as there is one group followed by another and by another so that it is difficult to take pictures without tourists getting in your shots. I'm sure it is much better in the off season. Also, why use a narrator with a British accent to narrate a video about such an iconic American site? This video doesn't capture the colors of the canyon well, and the exposure blows out the highlights frequently when including some of the sky in the frame.",1441324800,,840,4.6066666666666665
