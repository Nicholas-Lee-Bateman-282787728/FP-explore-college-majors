8122175,5,B000FGFBL2,My kind of movie. Action every minute and it doesn't drag on. Characters were believable and well portrayed. Worth every penny I spent for it and worth the time watching.,1373241600,,170,4.7
8122176,4,B000FGFBL2,"When first released it was the only one that was slightly different from the rest,I enjoyed the show and now I have it in my collection I can watch it when i'm in the mood and when nothing else of interest is on to watch time. Acting is good and the future is not that far away science fiction whatever it is worth getting to watch.",1270857600,2,332,4.045454545454546

8122178,5,B000FGFBL2,"this is a good b-movie. it has action all the time,it is cyber/robot vs human kind of movie. the govenrement built t-force 4 cybernauts that they use to beat crime. but when they shoot a chopper filled with hostages, the governement decides to ""switch off"" the machines. the machines don't understand why the governement wants to eliminate something they built, so they go against the governement. this movie is filled with non stop action, non stop fight scenes, explotions etc. a must see for b movie action fans",1155513600,10,514,4.8522727272727275
