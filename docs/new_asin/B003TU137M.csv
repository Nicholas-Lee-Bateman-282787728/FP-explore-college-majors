And for those of you concerned about the opening, it is shown at the beginning of each episode. :D

I recommend this DVD for every wild thornberry fan!",1300060800,,332,4.253968253968254

4192839,5,B003TU137M,"I remember watching this show all the time when I was a little kid (4 years old-ish) and just loved watching how Eliza could talk to animals and was EXTREMELY disappointed when the show was replaced by spongebob. This year I am taking a global studies course in high school and now can understand some of the other underlying themes that play through as the Thornberrys visit different areas of the world. It's a good show to watch when you're really stressed out and just need a ""brain break.""

I would highly recommend buying this if you have young children who have outgrown shows for toddlers, as well as for anyone who enjoys watching a well-written cartoon that doesn't rely on heavy violence and/or vampires. It's a classic",1296518400,,730,4.703125
4192840,4,B003TU137M,I am so excited to finally be able to get the Thornberrys on Season its just what happened to Season 2 and 3? Anyways my sister got this for me for Christmas and I have watched this now a bunch of times they just never get old. My only problem with my copy is that their is a blue line that runs across disc four. I have a feeling that that may have something to do with the skipping/pausing in Blood Sisters. It may just be my copy though because I haven't heard anything else like that from anyone who got this. I finally ordered Season 5 and can't wait to see the newest episodes again all together and not in choppy recorded format as I have had for several years now.,1296000000,2,672,4.098484848484849

4192842,5,B003TU137M,"I couldn't possibly be more thrilled that amazon is releasing all of the old Nick classics to DVD! When I first saw Hey Arnold and Doug on DVD, I jumped for joy lol. And I hoped that they would release the others as well. FINALLY, The Wild Thornberrys season 1 is on DVD!!!!!!!!! :) As well as Angry Beavers (another favorite of mine)I just purchased those 2 shows, and I love them. The details on the dvd cases are great! These nickelodeon classics are such great cartoons, Compared to the shows that are on tv now. Which is why its amazing that people can now have them as part of their dvd collection.

Needless to say I've been waiting a long time to see this show again, because I truly enjoyed all the great adventures that Eliza endured with her pet Darwin and the rest of the Thornberry clan.

I always thought this show was so well written, with characters I've come to love. Eliza Thornberry was so fearless, intelligent, and truly loved animals. Alot of my favorite episodes are included so I've had the pleasure of watching them over and over again!!!

Wow! I hope Amazon will release the rest of the seasons very soon, because there are so many more Thornberry adventures to enjoy!!! Can't wait for season 2!!!",1281312000,4,722,4.589147286821706

4192909,5,B003TU137M,"The Wild Thornberrys is a Nickelodeon cartoon series that aired in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  This DVD box set from Shout Factory contains the first 20 episodes of the series.

I'll be completely honest - The Wild Thornberrys was never one of my favorite Nicktoons as a kid.  I watched it fairly regularly, but I can't say it was ever a show I specifically sat down to watch.  That said, it has aged well and remains a decently entertaining show to this day.  It probably comes closest to being educational of any of the Nicktoons as well.

This series was produced by Klasky-Csupo, probably best known for their first Nicktoon, Rugrats, as well as for their other Nicktoons, Aaahh!! Real Monsters, Rocket Power, and As Told by Ginger, and for their work on the early seasons of The Simpsons.  The animation style of this series will be very familiar to any fans of the other K-C Nicktoons.  On these DVDs, the animation definitely shows its age, but it is watchable and still far better than many cartoons of its era.

This DVD is the general retail release of Season 1.  This season was previously released as an Amazon exclusive Media on Demand (MOD) set burned to order and available for a relatively high price.  The retail set has a much more professional feel to it, it comes packaged in a clear case with some nice art on the inside, as opposed to the standard issue black case that the previous release used.  Additionally, the previous release had silent, static menus while this new set has animated ones with the show's theme song playing in the background.  The old set also had some compatibility issues related to the nature of the product; being burned on demand onto DVD-R discs led to complaints about the discs not being playable on certain players.  While I personally never experienced that issue with any of the MOD sets, this new set should be free of those problems regardless.

This release contains NO extras whatsoever. Personally, this doesn't bother me as I usually use DVD extras once, at most.  I understand that some people fully expect all DVDs to have extras, but for me, it just isn't that big of a problem.  The episodes are here, and in the end that's what the fans have been waiting for.

This is the first Nickelodeon release from Shout Factory, and they have several more planned for the rest of this year.  While I am not the biggest fan of The Wild Thornberrys, I purchased this set to support Shout Factory's line of Nickelodeon releases and fans of The Wild Thornberrys.  Even though I could take it or leave it, I'm sure there are people out there who want this series to be completely released on DVD as badly as I want Rocko's Modern Life or The Angry Beavers.  Overall, this is a quality release of the complete first season and overlooking the lack of anything but the episodes themselves fans should be happy to finally see this series come to DVD.

Note:  The Wild Thornberrys seasons 2-5 were, until recently, available from Amazon.  Those seasons are the older MOD releases, and have NOT been announced or released by Shout Factory.  As of July 16, 2011 the older MOD releases for seasons 2-5 have been discontinued, however they may still be available through third party sellers.",1309046400,14,3240,4.6520210896309315
4192910,5,B003TU137M,"It's ALL of Season One of Nickelodeon's ""The Wild Thornberrys"" in one box set! It's a 4 disc set.

I will have a review for every season of ""The Wild Thornberrys"" for you to read. Personally, I think ""The Wild Thornberrys"" is a great show. You learn much about geography and biology in a fun, fun way. I just wish that Nickelodeon did not take it off of the air. Oh, and the coolest part is that Nigel Thornberry, the father, is voiced by Tim Curry. I think that he is cool.

Also, Season One of ""The Wild Thornberrys"" is available to watch if you have a Netflix subscription and have a computer or a Nintendo Wii and can stream video (the Nintendo Wii will need the internet to use the Netflix Channel). Contact Netflix for more information.

So, purchase this DVD Box Set for your family and get ready to go with Eliza as she travels around the world talking to animals!!!",1306800000,19,2194,4.712041884816754
4192911,5,B003TU137M,"This was one of my favorite shows, even though I was twenty-something when it first aired.  One of my favorite aspects of this show is how we get to travel around the world with Eliza and her family, experiencing different cultures, customs and sometimes languages.  I think I'd have loved this show even without the fascinating 'talking to animals' thing.

This is a great series for getting people interested in other parts of our world.  I also deeply appreciate the way it makes you care about animals/the environment, not in a preachy sort of way, but YOU care because ELIZA and her family care, to the point of being willing to risk their lives.

There is also an awesome movie you absolutely cannot miss out on-it's a whole lot less expensive than the series, and is a good starting point if you want to try a bit of the series before jumping in the water.  You won't be sorry!",1306800000,,884,4.528301886792453

Even though this show stars a girl as the main character, my 2 and 4 year old boys enjoyed it.  The series is about a unique family (2 daughters, mother and father) who travel the world in a CommVee van looking for rare animals to film for the dad's nature show he hosts.  So they are far from an everyday family, especially when you factor in the Eliza can speak to animals!  My boys like that part because they think its funny!  I think its neat because she gets to eavesdrop on animals and talk to them about nature.  Her experiences with animals are not always friendly but she seems to work things out and every episode is an adventure!  It is a cute series and appropriate for young kids.  There are animal facts, different animals and cultures and lots of fun!  It is also a great value at only $1 per episode!

4192913,5,B003TU137M,"This title popped up as a recommended title on a movie rental site we subscribe to and I was pleasantly surprised! The show tracks a family's adventures through the wild and their close encounters with animals and other parts of nature. The Thornberrys are an intrepid clan indeed, traveling around in their Communications Vehicle aka Commvee, and young Eliza Thornberry is a wonderful character - she is knowledgeable and helpful, and has the special power to speak to animals because of her encounter with an African shaman. This results in her close bond with most animals, including her pet chimpanzee, and she goes about solving problems.

The first season has 20 episodes, running about 23 minutes each. The titles are:

Flood Warning
