6402774,5,B00K34RP56,"Being a native Detroiter, I must admit that I am biased toward Detroit.  All I heard when I was growing up was how bad Detroit was to the outside world.  Little did people know that, outside of Richmond, VA, Detroit had the largest number of African American homeowners in the country. Thanks to the unions, every person who worked for one of the Big Three could make a decent living wage to take care of their families.  When the auto industry bottomed out (there is still much debate on whether that was intention or not with NAFTA), prosperous Midwestern cities like Detroit, Cleveland, and Akron fell by the wayside as well.  However, history had proven that some things that go down, do rise again like the phoenix.  There are still plenty of positive aspects of my hometown, and those who are visionary can see them.  I appreciate the courage of Anthony Brogdon and his team of workers who made this film possible. I plan to purchase more copies and give them as gifts to people I know who have moved to other parts of the country long before Detroit so called ""died."" Thanks again, Mr. Brogdon for believing in our hometown.",1413936000,10,1131,4.601990049751244

8655629,1,B00K34RP56,"This guys heart is in the right place, but I was expecting a history of the rise, and fall, and hopefully rise again of a once great city.  Nope.  No history, no politics . . . nothing.  Just a bunch of interviews from people who work in organizations around Detroit.  It was similar to a bunch of infomercials.  The narrator was reading from the screen half the time.  The editing and transitions were similar to a high school kids 10th grade project.  The only reason I kept watching was because I paid $3 and believed it could only get better.  One guy had a face mask on during his interview . . . . I suppose that might truly be indicative of the D.",1497744000,,654,4.217741935483871
8655630,2,B00K34RP56,"I went into this expecting something akin to the outstanding BURN documentary about the life of Detroit Firefighters. Unfortunately I was tremendously disappointed to discover something more akin to a hastily put-together high-school film project. The documentary suffers from poor narration and crude editing, which make for a tedious watch. The 1 hour and 12 minutes seemed more like 2 hours and 12 minutes. Although there were some good information provided, it wasn't done in a compelling way, and I just became bored after awhile. It's great to promote the positives of Detroit, since that's rarely done, but to call it ""The finest Documentary Ever Made About Detroit""..... well, that's a long-shot at best. Two generous stars for the effort.",1492819200,,747,5.233333333333333
8655631,2,B00K34RP56,"#1 Poor quality
Although I do commend the amateur film maker for his work the movie really isn't a movie, rather an amateur power-point laden compilation of interviews, clips and screenshots of Detroit.
#2 Too expensive
I'd pay .50 cents for this movie...not $2.99
#3 It was accurate",1492300800,,283,4.916666666666667
8655632,3,B00K34RP56,"Learned some interesting facts about Detroit, and he seems really passionate about Detroit.  But the production quality is fairly amateur.  The information doesn't always seem to move in an intuitive manner.  There were a few parts where I wondered what just happened when it changed from subject to subject and interviewee to interviewee

I appreciated it, but I'm a big Michigan history and travel nerd.  I wouldnt expect the casual viewer to enjoy it without some serious suspension of expectations",1489708800,,501,5.2125

8655636,2,B00K34RP56,"This was an interesting perspective from a very grass-roots perspective. A well-intended effort, but extremely amateur in production value.

There is not a coherant flow to the material that flows through the documentary, much feeling more like a glorified PowerPoint presentation full of random facts and figures interspersed with interviews with local people/organizations. Its often unclear who the people interviewed are, or why we would care about their opinions (e.g. rarely are titles or organizations of the speakers made clear).

Lots of this feel like: ""look what neat effects and fonts I can use"" and it becomes very distracting to the message of the video.

Detroit IS a a great city and is experiencing a resurgence and it would be great to see better story provided.",1440374400,4,780,5.174603174603175
