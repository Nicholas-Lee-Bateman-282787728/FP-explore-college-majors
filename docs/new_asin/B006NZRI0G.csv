5008406,5,B006NZRI0G,"This is an awesome series; I never miss an episode; thank goodness for the DVR. I have the first 3 seasons on DVD and can't wait until season 4 becomes available in the U.S. (F.Y.I. - I had to wait a year for season 3 to become available in the U.S. - bummer) The storyline has endless possiblilities and I love the dragons. Sure beats the crap ""reality"" shows that have saturated EVERY possible channel that I end up blocking. I'm glad that the SyFy channel picked it up for another season and hope that they continue to do so. This series is very entertaining for everyone and is one of my favorites along with The Closer which is now ending after it's 7th season and The Dresden Files, which only lasted one season; good thing I found it on Amazon...THANK YOU!",1329868800,8,763,4.380281690140845

5008408,5,B006NZRI0G,"Merlin Season 4 is definately the darkest one yet & some of the characters we know will not live to see next season.

In the first 2 episodes of the season Morgana takes revenge on Arthur, Camelot & Merlin for killing her sister Morgause, by summoning the Callieach to tear open the veil between the worlds, The Dorocha, which are hellish creatures, pour forth killing anyone who succumbs to their touch. With Uther a shadow of his former self, it falls to Arthur & his Knights to protect the Kingdom. It will take more than swords to vanquish their enemy this time & when Merlin finds out it takes someone to make the ultimate sacrifice to stop the Dorocha he is determined that this will be him fulfilling his destiny, but who will actually make the Ultimate Sacrifice? Arthur is celebrating his birthday & Uther who is in better spirits now decide to hold a banquet which will include a traveling fair, Arthur gets a little worse for wear with his drinking & gets involved with the entertainment but with sinister results, Uther has to come to his son's rescue when things start to turn nasty, but at what cost?

Julius Borden arrives in Camelot with 2 parts of the Triskellion key looking for the 3rd which will lead him to the tomb of Ashkanar where the last dragons egg is located, Merlin has to get to Ashkanar to protect the egg as only he can do being the last Dragon Lord & he has to stop Julius wreaking havoc with a dragon he can control. Arthur has been in a battle with King Caerleon & has triumphed over him. When his uncle Agravaine demands that to show his power as a King, Arthur must take the life of Caerleon, Arthur is unsure as to whether he could take a life in cold blood, & then to have the wrath of Queen Annis rain down on him & his loyal knights for his treachery. Merlin is going to need all his persuasive powers to stop him making a big mistake.

Merlin is wounded in a surprise attack on Arthur & his knights when they are traveling to a secret meeting, & is taken to Morgana who decides she can take revenge on Arthur by using Merlin to kill him so she puts a Fomorroh serpent into Merlin's neck which makes the victim have one all consuming thought & for Merlin that is to kill Arthur at any cost, with some hilarious results. Gaius & Guinevere realize that something is wrong when Merlin starts to behave strangely & Gaius knows that the only way to stop Merlin is to paralyze the serpent for long enough for Merlin to disguise himself as Emrys & go to Morgana's hideout to destroy the jar of Fomorroh by fire which is the only way to kill it. This is where Morgana meets her nemisis Emrys for the first time & all hell breaks loose!

5008409,5,B006NZRI0G,"I used to like Glee, but it getting a bit naughty for me.  Even Harry Potter is a bit scary for my 6 yrs old. Now I found Merlin.  It is clean and well written.  There is no nudity, profanity or anything that I should worry about my 6yrs and 12yrs old to watch.  Some critics said that this show's make up and language is too modern.  My 12yrs said, ""If it talked in the old English, I would not understand it and the show would be boring.  This is perfect.""  My family cannot get enough.  We tried to get the book like Harry Potter, but find none.  We even requested our local library to order the series.  It was well written and follows through.  The actors and actresses are great regard young and old.  I grew to like each character more and more.  Even the valiant, if they made me hate and angry, that meant the acting was good.  I love the line Morgana said, ""Just like you father"" when Uther told her that she is killing the innocent.  Not only you hate the fact she is  disrespected her father, you also understand the fact how she becomes this way.  My teenage watch the part that Arthur pulls out the sword from the stone.  He was puzzled and went back to watch Season 3 to find that Merlin had put the sword on the stone.  Both my kids 6 and 12 keep going back and forth and all the series.  They seem to never bore at the story and laughed at those funny dialogs between Gius, Merlin and Arthur.",1328745600,3,1409,4.148148148148148

8501523,5,B006NZRI0G,"My husband and I really enjoyed the first three seasons of Merlin. Its one of the only tv shows that we can watch without feeling awkward during uneeded sex scenes. We love the characters, the story lines, and the new view of the classic story of Camelot. Although the special effects are sometimes cheesy, we would much rather see some unconvincing monsters then see a bunch of strangers naked. can't wait until the fourth season is available for purchase in the United States.",1336262400,2,478,4.771084337349397
