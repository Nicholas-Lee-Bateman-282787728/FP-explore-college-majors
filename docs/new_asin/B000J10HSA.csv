8148655,1,B000J10HSA,"This s a product review of Harlem Double Feature (Go Down Death! / Sunday Sinners) released by Alpha Video.

The Good Points
- Has a menu

The Bad Points
- No subtitles
- Both films obvious VHS rips and really poor quality at that.
- Audio out of sync with video in Go Down Death

These movies are on the verge of unwatchable. Alpha should state whether the source is original or VHS.

I give this release 0 stars but Amazon says it has to get at least one which it doesn't deserve!",1372982400,,482,4.150537634408602
