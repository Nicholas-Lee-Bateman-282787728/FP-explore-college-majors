5975252,1,B00FCAK1FC,"I suppose it would be ironic to call the sentences ahead spoilers, but youve been warned.  If you are looking for something intelligent or even relevant in this train-wreck of a story, look much further, because its not to be found here.  The gist:  a young womans body begins to decay for no apparent reason.  One could almost argue that she is a metaphor for our disintegrating social moral structure of today, or that as she decomposes, her sense of self suddenly findswell, you know the rest.  But thanks to the near-fatal doses of full-frontal nudity that pervade the film, and the fact that Kayden Rose emotes about as much as a real corpse, there is little to be had for viewer connectedness.  Why should anyone give one iota of crap what happens to this girl?  Never mind the fact that there are too many questions in the film that shouldnt be there that never get answered:  First and foremost, why the hell doesnt she get to a doctor?  Why was she with that ugly-assed boyfriend?  Why does she randomly engage in oral sex with a guy she rebuffed 5 seconds earlier?? Why the murderous spree?  And of course, why did it take so long to get to the hallucinatory ending of this film?",1400284800,2,1189,4.509345794392523
5975253,4,B00FCAK1FC,"I must say that I've never quite seen anything like this! I can't really say I ""enjoyed"" this per se, but I highly commend the filmmakers and especially the leading lady for taking on such a venture. This is a really creepy, gory, cleverly done film about a woman who is decaying while alive. I look forward to their future films!",1395532800,2,330,4.426229508196721
5975254,5,B00FCAK1FC,I just got done watching this movie and its very disgusting and disturbing. You basically watch a woman rot away. And there's no explanation as why its happening. And thats pretty much it. I actually fast forwarded a few times cause I thought I was gonna vomit lmao. That's how sick this movie is. And I loved it. I don't think I've seen a movie this disgusting. I'm so happy I picked this up. If you love horror and gore pick this movie up. And prepare yourself to be grossed out.,1394409600,2,481,4.2967032967032965
5975255,3,B00FCAK1FC,"...but not much else. Pardon any spoilers here, but there were some things going on that just made you go ""Huh?"" and scratch your head. Sorry, but if you wake up and are able to pull your fingernails off, then you probably need to go to the doctor. And if you're so weak that getting out of bed is painful, then you're probably not able to take on grown men, much less dispatch of them...

... YET... the special effects were pretty cool. Our hapless protagonist goes from bruised and itchy skin to rotting flesh falling off her bones, a scene highly reminiscent of Uncle Frank oozing his way back from the netherworld in ""Hellraiser."" (No doubt a homage to Clive Barker.) Well, you be the judge. We all have our reasons for liking and/or hating movies.",1394409600,,753,4.4963503649635035
5975256,1,B00FCAK1FC,"Without reading too much about it, I bought this thinking..hey it could be a interesting storyline...but I was terribly wrong. Slow, boring, don't care, always inside a apartment you are stuck from the beginning to endure this to the end.
  The one star is for the great decaying effects.",1392422400,3,288,4.857142857142857
5975257,2,B00FCAK1FC,"I fell for the hype, the tag line was a Cronenburg style body horror with rancid flesh, it sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. I shouldn't have bothered as it's pretty dull. The set up is ok, but the story is thin. A young struggling artist starts waking up with mysterious markings, she assumes that they are from her partners, but they continue and get gradually worse. She also kills a few people and plays with herself a lot.

The problem with the film is that it drags on, nothing much happens and there's no interesting revelations, just a grim monotony. It also teases at some madness behind the transformation\, but they don't really add anything and are confused scenes with no real coherence.

It does however do one thing well and that is the decay of her body, the effects are good and the whole film carries a sense of the disgusting, it's not enough to turn it into a good film, but it did prevent it from being rated as truly awful.",1391904000,4,963,4.404494382022472
5975258,2,B00FCAK1FC,"I happened to see the cover of this film (not the one shown here) on a free streaming movie website and thought it looked interesting. After reading the plot, as simple as it sounded, I was still intrigued and decided to watch it. What is the plot you ask? Well its about a girl in an apartment that begins to decompose and rot while still alive. It's as simple as that. There's no plot twists and turns, no surprises at all. But even with being said, this review is going to have some spoilers in it, so turn back now if you wish to find out for yourself. And here lies the first problem with this film. Nothing else happens!! Probably 90% of the movie is a naked girl walking around in her apartment gradually getting sicker and turning, in effect, to a decaying zombie. There's no twist at the end. Not even a hint of explanation as to why this is happening to her; nothing. The movie ends when she completely decays and melts into a mess of goo and bones. If you've seen the 1986 version of The Fly where Jeff Goldblum's character is shown slowly turning into the fly creature, then imagine that happening for pretty much 90 minutes straight. And why is she naked the whole time? I assume its so they could show off the special effects, but most of the close up shots shown deals with her head and extremities that wouldn't matter if she was nude or not. Nudity doesn't bother me in films, but I thought it in this case, it was a bit unnecessary. In some ways, this movie is filmed sorta like a college art film experiment. There are these small interludes that has these weird filters and film effects. They sort of look like something from a Rob Zombie music video. They show up throughout the film, last for a minute or two, then its cuts back to the actual movie. I thought these were kinda cool. The biggest problem I think I have is something so obvious that it was driving me crazy while I was watching it and made me want to scream. During the whole film, the main protagonist, never..NEVER attempts to go to the doctor, visit a hospital, call 911...nothing. Its vaguely mentioned once early on then is quickly forgotten (because a guy decides to let a very sickly looking girl perform oral sex on him rather than take her to a hospital). And its mentioned near the end too, but again, nothing becomes of it. How do you just bypass that and ignore it? 10-15 minutes into the film, the girl would be calling for help, going to the doctor, etc. But nope, she's rotting before her very eyes and yet she does nothing . And other character's reactions to seeing her in such a state are way underwhelming. They nearly act like she has the flu or something. And speaking of other characters, she manages to easily dispatch two grown men and kill them, yet she's in such a weak physical state. That didn't really make sense as well. Ok, so I've bashed this film enough..how about some of the positives? Well on a side note, it has an awesome song by The Black Angels in it called ""Manipulation"". However, the biggest thing this movie has going for it is the gross out factor. Though its a slow and gradual process, the special effects get better and better as it goes. And this being a pretty low budget film I would assume, it has some great effects. I was very impressed in that regard. And I do like the overall concept to this film. Yes, its simple, but i feel it's an interesting and intriguing idea. But the problem is, there's just not a lot else going on here. The film is extremely slow paced. Again, at least some explanation or back story; something that have sped it up a bit. But really the only reason to keep watching is to see the effects get more and more disgusting. Overall, part of me really wants to hate this one, and part of me really wants to like it. But I feel that the negatives just out way the positives. I recommend viewing this one based the concept and special effects alone. But don't expect much else.",1391558400,17,3939,4.375170532060027
5975259,5,B00FCAK1FC,This epic journey of visual and emotional decay is a master piece of cinema grotesque.  Kayden Rose shines as she deteriorates.,1384387200,9,127,5.0476190476190474
5975260,5,B00FCAK1FC,"This art-house horror film (gore film?) is an incredible look at a woman who begins to literally decompose as her will to live escapes her.  The slow build and gradual rot highlight her despondency beautifully, and are made incredible by the acting by Kayden Rose and the work of the special effects team in creating a visceral depiction of her decay.  An excellent and thought provoking movie.",1384387200,6,394,4.865671641791045
8614384,5,B00FCAK1FC,"Omg I literally waited years to see this movie. I tried to see if online but couldn't.
It is so good. With graphic violence and gore. And an underlying sadness and despair of the main character that is heart wrenching and inconceivable.",1523059200,,236,4.642857142857143
8614385,5,B00FCAK1FC,"Gruesome, disturbing, weird... Those adjectives might perfectly describe this little low budget horror gem.  It's about a naked woman decomposing in her apartment.  Nothing gets spelled out for you.  No detailed explanations or clever plot twists.  So this will not appeal to several viewers.  But what it does have will likely excite the seasoned gorehound... a unique and brilliantly horrifying premise chock full of superbly sick effects.  It leaves enough unanswered possibilities to allow your mind to waver relentlessly while your stomach churns.  Great independent horror flick, 4.5 stars.",1509408000,,596,5.629213483146067

8614387,3,B00FCAK1FC,"The basic plot of Thanatomorphose is that one day a woman just starts to rot away, which is apt since the title is a French word meaning visible signs of an organism's decomposition. This basic story has turned into its own horror subgenre over the last few years with films like Contracted and Starry Eyes, but Thanatomorphose is the first of its kind. This film is the most low budget of the three and also the most simple, but it also has a lot of the same plot points and situations as the other films, namely being isolated from her peers and being completely unsatisfied with her life as a whole. After a night of rough sex, the woman wakes up with dark bruises all over her body. She brushes it off as normal because her boyfriend regularly leaves bruises on her body. After this, we get a glimpse of her everyday life. Everything is horrible and a disappointment. Her boyfriend abuses her regularly and jokes about it in front of their mutual friends. Those mutual friends just awkwardly avoid the subject and never address the problem at all or try to help her except one guy who takes the opportunity to take advantage of her and then abruptly leave. The woman bends over backwards to do everything for her boyfriend even though she's obviously not happy. He gives her nothing in return except for pain and cruelty. In her professional life, her art is rejected from a program she applied for and she's been working on a single sculpture for years that will probably never be finished. This is the only glimpse of the woman's life that we see before she starts to rot.

The decomposition process is interrupted by dreams of decomposition and dreams of the men in her life suggestively cutting off her flesh and eating it. This scene is reminiscent of the couple of sex scenes from earlier in the film, making it clear that these men simply use her and illustrate the toxic effect they have on her. She eventually kills them (or at least dreams about doing so), but it isn't enough to save her from completely rotting away. The woman spends most of the film naked, but I don't find it exploitative. It isn't to titillate the audience and the cinematography reflects that. Both she and her boyfriend walk around the film naked and there's a comfortable nonchalance as if that's what they do every day. The sex scenes are experimental and unpleasant to watch because it shows that nature of their relationship before you even hear them speak. Later, when she starts rotting, it's even less appealing for obvious reasons and more symbolic about her raw feelings behind her facade. I've seen a lot of people complain about how she doesn't go to the doctor like any sane person would, but the film really isn't about a physical affliction. Many people in her situation, trapped in an abusive relationship without anyone who cares about her with no means of escape on top of professional failure, would not seek out help. Lots of people just go about their miserable existence and accept their fate even though help is available to them. The film portrays this mentality well and makes the physical symptoms as grotesque as the mental, emotional, and physical ones are in real life.

Thanatomorphose is a minimalist film. Long stretches of time go by with no dialog; none of the characters have names; and the plot is very bare bones. The film takes place claustrophobically only in her apartment. She is shown briefly leaving and coming back, but everything else is in the few rooms where she lives. The other films in this subgenre build a better picture of the person's life and make it more palatable to watch, but at their core, they're the same. All of these women have unfulfilling lives surrounded by people who don't really care about them. The rotting is simply the physical form of what would happen to these women mentally and emotionally in these situations. The special effects are amazing for the budget and the film is shot in interesting, unexpected ways. The music is beautiful and captures the mood perfectly with mournful, slow moving strings. Unfortunately, there were quite a few things that just didn't measure up to the other films. The acting in the majority of the film is painful to watch and the dialog is wooden. The sex scenes seemed really out of place stylistically compared to the rest of the film. It featured extreme closeups, bright colors, and strange avant garde music that didn't mesh with the very stripped down and minimalist style of the film as a whole. I'm glad I watched it because it seems to be the first in this rash of women rotting away films and sets up the formula for such films, but it leaves a bit to be desired.",1425168000,2,4670,4.659393939393939

8614389,5,B00FCAK1FC,"I collect and have seen thousands of indie and foreign horror movies, and this is in my top 15! A bit of a slow start, but once it gets going, it's a rollercoaster through psychological hell! Visually tormenting, emotionally unforgiving, it gets under your skin and chews your nerves raw.
A great gem any hard-core horror buff should have.
Thanatomorphose-you won't soon forget it.",1415318400,,381,4.96875
8614390,4,B00FCAK1FC,"I have to admit to myself - I liked this, with the caveat that I don't generally care for horror and gore and I don't watch many horror flicks. I'm also pretty squeamish about stuff like maggot-infested rotting flesh and the like (call me strange, I know). I'd learned about this movie and prepared myself accordingly. I think the device of having the ""heroine"" (?!!) be a cute young twenty-something girl makes what happens more shocking and revolting than if the main character had been, say, an older man or woman (we all want our girls to be young, pretty and blemish/rot/maggot free, now, don't we?). Many of the reviews here complain about the slow pacing and lack of action but I think these are part and parcel of what the picture is about: random, senseless physiological horror. I would agree that she might have wanted to call a doctor, but maybe she didn't have a good health plan? (We see her going out dressed in a uniform which might be a nurse's aide's, so she should have known, right?). And why didn't she just kill herself when things got too brutally disgusting for her to bear?

I thought ""what the f***?!!"" whenever those loud, bloody sequences interrrupted but I guess they were supposed to be her nightmares. (Rotten dog carcass very effective!). I also was engaged by the anguished, slow deliberateness of her physical actions (e.g., pulling off her ear and saving it along with other body parts in bell jars). They collectively seemed to say: ""Oh, f***! If I'm rotting and dying I might as well go all in and make a record of it."" I was interested in the quick edits or cuts in the first part of the film (e.g. when she's dressing her boyfriend's wound), I thought they were sloppy editing but then realized they were probably deliberate. The special effects are great, and the final sequence (last couple of minutes) is stomp-on-your head hideous! A complaint would be that the extra stuff (making of film, interviews, etc.) needed English subtitles and there weren't any in the edition I have. I know these guys are a low-budget operation but c'mon! At least subtitles would have been helpful in understanding the film from the viewpoint of the people involved in making it.",1410220800,3,2202,4.704663212435233

8614392,1,B00FCAK1FC,Is it supposed to be art?  Is it a cinematic homage to John Cage?  Is it just trite garbage?  It's garbage.  Never has any film taken so long to say so little about a concept that in competent hands would have made for a hell of a movie.  I guess we are supposed to fill in the interminable stretches of silence with our own truth but the truth is that it is pathetic.,1406851200,,368,3.9863013698630136

Storyline had a lot of potential but fell flat after 10min... all those taglines and different covers worldwide... thought this would be like a genital version of 'I, Zombie'.
