7837489,5,6303082254,"Couple of years ago, I debated for a while whether I should pay 50 dollars for any bass video.  After comtemplating for a while, I bought this video because I had hard time believing that any man could play at such an incredible speed/ make his bass sound as if two people were playing.  After watching this video, I was simply blown away.  I would've paid more to buy this if I had to.

I was quite shocked because I've read some negative reviews about this video saying things like ""he doesn't really teach you anything, and then takes off."" - I have to disagree with this statement.  After watching this video, I learned that his ""thumping"" (slaping), and his ""tapping"" (pressing on the frets with both hands) techniques are not all that special or difficult - it just takes a lot of practice.  Since the concept of thumping is quite simple, there's really nothing much to elaborate.  If you want to know exactly what Victor Wooten is doing, I suggest that you buy ""The Best of Victor Wooten"" published by Cherry Lane.

I must say that this video is not perfect- it does have it's flaws (minor ones I might add).  I didn't like how Victor doesn't go over the problems with unwanted ringing with the E and the A string, and there are strange black and white clips of Victor doing circus tricks in the ""improvised jam"" section, that really doesn't need to be there.  I also wish that this vhs came out on dvd, but it's not big of a deal.

But the bottom line is, this is one of my favorite bass vidoes out there (I have just about every single bass dvd's that are sold in amazon), along with the ""Bass day 98"" dvd.  Very inspirational.  A must buy for any serious bass players.",1114992000,,1678,4.391585760517799
7837490,3,6303082254,"I am giving this video a generous three stars.  I have been playing bass for about five years now and Victor Wooten is, of course, like a god to me. The man can do things on the bass that I can only dream of.  This video is supposed to give you some insight to Victor's very unique style.  The format for the video is very straight forward, he gives you a short lesson on one of his fundamental techniques and then goes into an actually performance both solo and with a band.  The lessons aren't too informative, it is basically Wooten getting nasty and leaving you in his dust.  You can get an idea of how he executes his amazing bass lines, but he gives you no real helpful way to practice, he just shows them to you and then goes nuts.  I really just enjoy putting this video on and watching him let loose, but that isn't really worth the large price tag.  I have seen other bass videos that are more informative and definitley more helpful in actually teaching technique that are a lot cheaper so don't think that just because Victor is teaching it is automatically better.  What really kills me is that after Victor does an elaborate and complex demonstration of the ""simple"" techniques he employs he'll say something like ""See how easy it is"".  Meanwhile I'm sitting there with my mouth gapping and hands frozen over the fret board.  So in short, its a fun video to watch if you really love the guy, but if you are looking for some real educational value then look elsewhere.",1004227200,18,1481,4.411764705882353
7837491,1,6303082254,"this video is ""ok"". Its nothing to write home about. vic shows you a couple of tricks then runs off. there are alot of instructional videos out there that are unbelievable.  studiobassplayer.com are excellent!  the playing is amazing and to the point.  The best videos are the ones that don't use celebrities to sell the videos",990230400,3,327,4.803571428571429
7837492,4,6303082254,"Good video but in all honesty, poor instructional value.  Vic goes in depth into only two of his techniques (thumb up/down & tapping) and when he shows you the basic technique he flies away doing something much  more complex than anything you'll ever do.  The interviews are all the same  interviews you've read in every bass magazine or seen in another video so  you won't learn anything new or profound during those either.  But you get  to see him lay down the law on his bass which is ALWAYS exciting.  However,  sometimes you see his plucking hand while his fret hand is doing all the  work and vice versa, and when his brothers solo you never get to see what  they're doing, you see Vic playing.  Oh well, at least it's not as bad as  that ridiculous Making Music video where you don't see any of the soloists  until they're done soloing!  Overall though, a killer video if you can  stifle your laughter at Victor's jerry curl and lame pants.  Almost as good  as Bass Day '98.",955584000,8,982,4.451977401129944
7837493,3,6303082254,"Why didn't I give this a 5 rating? Unfortunately, I watched Vic's Bass Day tape first, which is so superior to anything I have ever seen or heard that I could only give his ""Super Bass Solo"" tape a 3, even though it  is certainly a good tape also.
I like the Bass Day tape better because,  in it, you get to see more of Victor jamming by himself or with just the  drums which is quite a spectacle.
So, since the Bass Day tape is cheaper  anyway, buy that one and then if you can afford it, pick up ""Super  Bass Solo"" also.",955497600,5,522,3.980769230769231
