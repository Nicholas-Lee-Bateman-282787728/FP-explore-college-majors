440394,5,6302235979,This is a very effective psychological war film with a great performance  by Broderick Crawford as the demented commander of a group of loose canons  located in an isolated jungle outpost during W.W.II. Robert Wagner is  ordered to the post for his transgressions and comes to terms with his own  lack of humanity. This film contains one of Hugo Friedhofer's best scores.  The stereo score on this VHS recording sounds excellent.,965865600,28,429,4.985915492957746
440395,3,6302235979,"This war drama tells how a southern soldier changes from a class conscious snob and becomes a human being with the help of Buddy Ebsen. It shows in flashbacks how he used to be a ruthless plantation owner and how he treated  his sharecroppers. Along comes WWII and realizes that in war, everybody is  the same. His buddies all get killed due to the cowardice of an officer and  Wagner almost kills him. He is courtmartial and sent to another unit and  meets a psycho company commander played with gusto by Broderick Crawford.  The platoon he is ordered to be with are sent up to relieve another platoon  on this hill. They are attacked by a Japanese company and everyone is  killed except Wagner and Ebsen, but Ebsen is wounded and Wagner must run  back for help. Will he make it in time to rescue Ebsen?  The movie was  nominated for Original Score and if you look real hard, you will recognize  Frank Gorshin, who later played the Joker on the TV version of Batman.  Not  the best war drama ever made, but is good nonetheless.",951868800,24,1028,4.462365591397849

I liked the portrayal of the island fighting action scenes, although fanciful, which caught the flavor of the war and advanced the plot.  It had several interesting plot threads running thru it.  I enjoyed seeing the movie again in it's entirety.  I thought Robert Wagner did a good acting job, as did Buddy Ebsen in his stereotypical role as a tobacco chewing lower class southerner.

440469,4,6302235979,"I first saw this film as a youngster in '57 when Robert Wagner was the nice guy Elvis wasn't, but wore the same haircut he had later in TV land with ""It Takes A Thief."" He's always troubled, whether appearing in ""What Price, Glory?"" with James Cagney and Dan Dailey etc. before breaking free of B movies and heading for TV mega-stardom. The standout actor is Broderick Crawford playing a wacko, named ""Waco""who seems to be at the edge of sanity constantly. The music, of all things, was nominated for an Oscar, while I would nominate all the gear difficult to duplicate in war films today: a troop transport,an LST, landing craft and several half-track trucks. Buddy Ebsen grows closest to Wagner before you can say Davy Crockett. Richard Fleischer directs the action from a soap-opera novel in the spirit of those times like ""Naked and the Dead,"" (a dull story) with Terry Moore looking fine in her cameos. Only here Fleischer is wise enough to leave the tugging home drama far behind in flashbacks smoothly handled. The supporting players are extensive WWII film players: Robert Keith (""Men In War""), Brad Dexter, Skip Homeier, Harvey Lembeck(""Stalag 17"")and an un-credited Frank Gorshin (Hollywood impressionist then). You might say this is an early PTSD film, exploring the sanity of men during battle while suffering battle fatigue. By the conclusion Wagner has swapped his feelings of class superiority as a southern cotton magnate for the self-regard of his fighting comrades. It was always nice to return to this film to appreciate the contribution the BAR model 1917 made to stand-off warfare. Either the BAR or Broderick Crawford barks you to attention in this early off-beat war yarn.",1433116800,2,1695,4.971830985915493

There is a kinship that lasts for the rest of your lives and it is something that you never forget.  The part played by Broderick Crawford was a bit unrealistic, sure there are malcontents and those who are afraid or have great fear.  I think the most significant thing about the film shows how being put in a life and death struggle shows how you can overcome and change your perception of the person you once were.

I was a hot shot(or so I thought) prep school grad and the college experience was initially hard to adjust to( less supervision and less coddling) It was about growing up and this is what happens to Sam Gifford. He is in a changing world where social classes are being hurled together. Sam is able to adjust but not some of his upperclass scions, Ray Mosby for example, who cracks under the strain of combat. The death of an old way of life, the arrival of maturity and the value of enduring friendships. This is what this movie is about. It sports excellent photography, the use of Cinemascope and some very good acting. Robert Wagner handles himself well and is more versatile than most people think. He is excellent in the War Lover and in an out of character role, excellent as the sociopathic killer in A Kiss Before Dying. The other cast members are never less than competent.

Broderick Crawford is fantastic as the unhinged captain, Waco, (he taunts Robert Wagner's character, calling him by his middle name, Francis, which makes me wonder if, decades later, Warren Oates' character in ""Stripes"", Sgt. Hulka, delivers the line ""Lighten up, Francis"" as a screenwriter's tribute. Sorry, that's just the way my mind works.) Buddy Ebsen, a few years away from becoming the iconic Uncle Jed Clampett, delivers a sly performance as Willie. Yeah, some say Robert Wagner was a bit wooden, but he's saddled with the role of rich jerk who learns a lesson from us poor people. To be honest, Robert Wagner has always looked like a rich jerk. I'm sure he's a good guy. Back to the unhinged Capt. Waco, who talks about his imaginary wife and surrounds himself with strangely devoted young men in sleeveless shirts. Hmmm...

440623,4,6302235979,"One thing I have learned about reviewing movies is to keep in mind the level of enjoyment experienced, relative to the film and the story it relates.  There are numerous very enjoyable, very good films out there that are not remotely Oscar winners, or even artistic successes.  This is one of them.

This is what I would call a ""thinking man's war film,"" in that it involves much more than combat action sequences by the score.  There are social and behavioral issues at play in this story that when combined, truly contribute to a very good film.  Even the ""flashbacks"" have a way of breaking up the narration in positive ways, to include one's perception of others, based on ""class"" or position in society.  The film sends a clear message that despite the fact we come from different strata of society, we are basically put together the same way.  In this film, Robert Wagner undergoes a developmental process that will not only affect his performance on the battlefield, but as a ""man"" when he returns to the absolutely stunning Terry Moore at the war's end.

The casting for the film is excellent, from Wagner to Buddy Ebsen, Broderick Crawford, Moore, and the various soldiers portrayed.  The battle scenes are quite good, and are focused more on individual qualities than on graphic battle sequences.  While this may not be a Five Star production, it is well worth owning, and definitely earns Four Stars.",1213142400,3,1411,4.793388429752066

But Gifford only came to realize the error of his rude ways when he was called to active duty and put among the troops in the Pacific theater in World War II...

The film opens with Gifford reassigned to a company posted up in the hills, a very isolated area under the command of a fanatical and probably queer army captain called Waco (Broderick Crawford).

With brief flashbacks, we discover that Gifford holds a well-earned Silver Star but one day, his emotions became dominant and his self-control completely lost when he assaults an officer in combat nearly killing him...

The attempt of Gifford-- seen to get a little shaky in combat--to master danger as far as to walk right along with the enemy, or not to leave the island without saving a wounded pal, hit the core of what must have happened on battlefields in World War II...

If Hollywood cannot suppress a great concept and turn it into drivel before a film gets made, they often will find a way to do it after it has been released.  Orson Welles learned this the hard way making Citizen Kane to his great pain, and could never get quite enough funding for any big film after that.

This is no Citizen Kane, nor will Robert Wagner ever, ever, be confused with Orson Welles. On the other hand, to call him un-charismatic?!? Not to a whole generation of girls in the 50's and 60's, including my sweetie.  Not to mention to a whole generation of guys who wanted to be like him.

As a war film, it is way above the cut and cannot be written off too easily after viewing.  I esteem it as much as Hell Is For Heroes with Steve McQueen or Attack! with Jack Palance.  Films that stood out from the fodder, and were rarely duplicated if ever.  Why this one never got respect, I am too young to have heard, and at this point, there is a whole new generation who will get to see, and perhaps appreciate it.

I saw this film many years ago on TV and I never quite forgot it, for many reasons, and I have been dying to see it released on DVD.

The other reviews on this site give a decent summation of the plot, but the truth of the film goes deeper.  Buddy Ebson as a sharecropper gives a slyly informed humanity to people we all have driven by when we saw them (barely) working in the fields, or else cleaning our offices, or in our kitchens.

Broderick Crawford so typifies the insanity of war, where we can find ourselve in situations without a rulebook, yet not knowing the rules means death.

Before the war, seen in flashback, Wagner is deeply unhappy at the top of the heap, and takes it out on those at the bottom of the pyramid as if he had no feelings.  Yet, he loves his wife with the passion of youth, and something deeper, as she him.

He is a landed aristocrat in a South about to experience drastic change, but has not yet figured out how to deal with the peasants who are people too.

If he were a lesser man, as is his best friend (Tod Andrews, who would later play the Gray Ghost on TV), the difficulty of being a chivalrous and decent man whose culture demands he forget decency when dealing with his social inferiors, he would not be so driven and unhappy.

War experiences bring out the best and worst in men, and we see his best friend (from before the war) fail the test and, in the process, killing Wagner's new friends, common men, made during the war, and we experience the pain when his surrogate father dies.  If you wondered where Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan got the shakes, watch Rober Wagner progress in this film.  He is more than adequate.  He has things to teach others who followed.

A film does not have to be perfect to be great, and this is a great film, and flawed, make no mistake.  Being ignored for so long means only that we should take a closer look now, and judge carefully before writing it off.

Get the DVD in widescreen.  On Turner TNT, only the credits are in widescreen, the rest is pan and scan, which is a shame.  In contrast, the original wide frame is composed to advantage throughout, when you see it for the first time in almost 50 years as it was meant to be seen.",1106784000,14,3270,4.2609400324149105
440630,2,6302235979,"There is not much to recommend this trivial world war II drama. Broderick Crawford, Buddy Ebsen, and Robert Wagner all confirm their tertiary status in the Hollywood pantheon. The plot is inept and incredible, staggering through bunches of flashbacks. The minor miracle (Rich and arrogant southern playboy/landowner comes of age and learns to love the common man) is insufficiently believable. The battle action is sporadic.
HOWEVER, the DVD presentation is fine. Super-saturated colors come through perfectly, and the definition is great! The DVD quality is the sole reason I give the film 2 stars rather than 1.

The story begins ""in medias res"" with a demoted sergeant being transferred to a distant post in the Pacific Theatre in WWII.  Robert Wagner plays this soldier from the South named Sam Gifford who must now rejoin the rank and file.  Under the command of a sadistic captain, Gifford recalls his past as a wealthy landowner and his treatment of his sharecroppers.  He then recalls the events of his heroism and demotion.  Through all of this, he learns that the people he mistreated back home are just as capable of heroism and that he has been wrong.
Buddy Ebsen, from ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" plays a part in this film, and I believe he made the movie enjoyable.  He wasn't comic relief, but played the stout-hearted sharecropper that truly showed Gifford the error of his ways.
The part of the sadistic captain doesn't seem to fit at first, but watch the whole movie, and his place and his story will make sense.
A fairly good movie, but the flashbacks seem a bit excessive.  They are necessary, but still seem a bit much where they are.",1034726400,7,1248,4.565022421524664

I could say more but I would probably say too much.  Watch it!",1481760000,,351,3.8055555555555554
