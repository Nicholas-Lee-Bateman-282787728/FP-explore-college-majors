6463494,5,B00L2YXT1K,"My husband and I found this movie riveting.  I took us right there, where we could actually see the process of the breaking down of our democracy happening before our eyes.  We could see the insanity of narrow vision, causing good Americans to ally themselves with those who have taken control of all our institutions:  the branches of government, the media, elections, and the culture.  The ruling class has taken control of these for the two most venal objectives that have existed through time, money and power.  With this growing money and power, they continue to ravage and destroy our freedoms and our security in the world.  I like that the film does not actually take positions.  It merely shows us real time behavior, and we can see the pattern taking shape.  Sunlight is our best hope for the beginning of the process of recovery.",1411516800,3,840,4.744827586206896
6463495,4,B00L2YXT1K,"Since 1981, awarding welfare to the rich at the expense of working people - better known as Reaganomics - has resulted in the disappearance of the middle class.  But as most Americans are not wealthy, how have lawmakers such as Ronald Reagan, people who destroy the average family's standard of living, remained in power?  The 2013 documentary CITIZEN KOCH provides answers, with both overviews of the general divisiveness that gets working people to vote against their own interests and a tight close-up on Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's so-called budget repair bill of 2011, a union-busting measure that resulted in massive demonstrations and a recall election.

CITIZEN KOCH does not spend as much time on its namesake, billionaire brothers/corporate welfare champions Charles and David Koch, as you might expect, but that seems to be the point.  Like mob  bosses who send underling thugs to do their dirty work, the Koch brothers stay in the background while Wisconsin Governor Walker, whose political career they bankroll, is the one we see running from the crime scene.  Would the Wisconsin governor recall election oust Walker from office?  If so, the Kochs will just send another goon to turn a middle class public employee into a $10/hour, no-benefits serf.

Gwen Moore, U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 4th congressional district, articulates that last point better than I can, as you'll see in the closing scenes of CITIZEN KOCH.  Don't rest on your laurels if you happen to beat these guys, she warns, because while you're celebrating they're regrouping to figure out a better way to steal from you.

6463498,5,B00L2YXT1K,"Whatever your political persuasion, the documentary ""Citizen Koch"" delivers an alarming description of democracy imperiled. Focused on the Wisconsin drama involving then Governor Scott Walker and movement for his recall, critical contributing elements include the Citizens United case and the U.S. Supreme Court, the Americans for Prosperity organization, Federal Elections Commissioners (past and present), and various Senators and Representatives.

Encompassing key development from April 2011 in Madison, Wisconsin to January 2012 in New Hampshire, ""Citizen Koch"" offers a primer in how we got to our currently dysfunctional situation regarding elections. At issue most directly are campaign finance laws and the push by some to lift corporation spending limits. Enter the Koch brothers, David and Charles, worth an estimated $72 billion dollars, their Koch Industries the second largest private corporation in the U.S. They are intent on contributing unfettered to election campaigns to make their voices heard and their wishes followed. They are anti-union, opposed to collective bargaining, and in favor of more stringent voter ID laws.

Multiple award-winning, Oscar nominated directors and producers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin have interviewed a who's who of individuals involved in and knowledgeable about the Citizens United case and corporate funding issues. Their film charts a clear, coherent course through the morass of legislative and judicial details.

Interweaving news footage, first-person interviews, and some helpful on-screen text. They feature spokespersons for the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Tea Party as well as ordinary folks prompted to action when they see their wishes trumped by out-of-state money from shadowy groups with anti-democratic, small d, agendas. The title alludes, of course, to ""Citizen Kane,"" that great film charting egomaniacal folly with unfortunate, contemporary parallels.",1408320000,7,1929,5.931654676258993
6463499,5,B00L2YXT1K,"I thought this film was incredible. As a conservative who votes for Republicans in most elections, I was hesitant going into the movie that it would be focused on a liberal or progressive agenda and would alienate conservatives. I was pleasantly surprised. The interviews with people like Buddy Roemer and average working class conservatives really highlighted that this is truly not a partisan issue. My sincere hope is that everyone in this country from the liberals to the conservatives will watch this and see what is really happening to our elections and our republic.

Hard working, ordinary people are being used as puppets by corporations to pass legislation and influence elections and the only goal those corporations consider is maximizing profits. In my home state of Georgia, talking to people about political activism and even voting is extremely frustrating. The most common response is a feeling of uselessness and a feeling of not mattering in the political system, and I agree with them. When billions are being spent to put a candidate in office, how do you convince someone that their $20 donation makes a difference? I think that if people from all parts of the political spectrum see this film with an open mind, theres no way that they can walk away without seeing that big money is what is really driving politics today and that elections have become an arms race where We the People no longer have a say.

The only way to put our republic back together again is for people to realize that there is a problem and then (like the people of Wisconsin) rise up and tackle it. Your film provides a great opportunity for people to realize what is happening. Once that is accomplished we can then take actions like passing a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United and giving Congress the authority to give elections and our government back to the people.",1408233600,27,1885,4.905956112852665
6463500,4,B00L2YXT1K,"Citizen Koch will open even well-informed eyes to the damage that our democracy has suffered from the billions that Charles and David Koch have spent to ensure that our government is bought and owned by the wealthiest 1%.  Banned from public television by the very forces it exposes, the film a must see, told mainly from the points of view of hard-working, middle-class Americans who have witnessed their lives and livelihoods being sold out from under them.

6463501,1,B00L2YXT1K,"This movie actually has very little to do with the sinister Koch brothers and their alleged buying of elections. It's instead simply a rehash of old footage from the failed 2012 effort to recall Wisconsin's democratically-elected governor, Scott Walker. Just as when Republicans campaign to recall a democratically-elected Democratic governor, this Democratic effort is portrayed as ""The People"" rising up against tyranny.  ""The People"" of course are typically of a uniformly low intelligence, led by the usual termagants. I once thought that the Democrats were at least less delusional than the Republicans, but after watching this movie, I admit that I may be wrong.

The recall was a miserable failure (Walker won 53% to 46%, a larger margin than in the original election), so the highlight of this movie (if it can be said to have any highlight) is apparently the inspirational activities of illiterate bumpkins aroused to action they don't really understand.  You can watch such blague, better filmed and written, on various PBS propaganda shows in the US, particularly ""Independent Lens,"" so why spend any money on this snoozer?

I must warn you that if you seek a movie that will send people into the streets, seeking justice by chanting banal slogans, this movie may have the opposite effect.

If you really wish to learn about the villainous Koch brothers, you may begin with the fact that according to the Open Secrets website, the top 6 -- and 14 out of the top 16 -- contributors to political campaigns are benefactors of the Democratic party.  Koch Industries ranks a meager 36th -- right behind the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn.

The maniacal and fiendish expressions on the faces of the flotsam of American society portrayed in the video is an equivalent in tension-building that rivals ""Salem's Lot"", ""It"", or certain Night Gallery episodes.

The mania reminds one of the frenzy that Adolf Hitler was able to foment, or the hysteria whipped up at KKK and neo-Nazi rallies.
The sooner intelligent voters take an active role in voting then the less chance the ignorant masses portrayed in the video have in forcing America to go belly-up morally.

8663444,4,B00L2YXT1K,This film is recommended because of its depiction of the blueprint that the Koch Brothers are using in states where they can get a toady like Scott Walker elected.  Wisconsin and Governor Walker may only be the first in a line of many states the Kochs will try to turn red and anti-union. The documentarian's choice to use as his primary spokespeople Republicans who were in unions and displaced by Scott Walker makes the unfairness of his acts even more convincing as they work to recall him.,1437436800,4,493,4.666666666666667
8663445,4,B00L2YXT1K,"From his book, ""The Machine,"" Lee Fang wrote, ""In Wisconsin, the newly elected Republican governor Scott Walker came into office and immediately pushed legislation to end collective bargaining for public employee unions, along with a series of budget and pay cuts for state workers. The move was quickly met with large protests, which gained headlines for weeks in the first few months of 2011."" To eliminate the ability to negotiate in collective bargaining is essentially union busting. Unions are the only competition that Republicans have in electoral politics. Busting the unions would essentially take away the voice of Democrats. Karl Rove, a sycophant to the nth degree, stated in 2010 the unions lost 612 thousand members. And, he added that if they continued to lose a half million members per annum in subsequent years, it would have a direct impact on electoral politics. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin said that the governor gave $117 million worth of tax breaks to the wealthy and cut the earned income tax credit doubling the tax on the poorest parents. Gov. Walker's chicanery led to large protests and the initiation of a recall, which required a minimum of 540 thousand signed petitions. Just under a million were collected, $30 million spent, and it all was nugatory. The governor was retained by 53 percent of the voters. Lee Fang wrote, ""On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, eliminated nearly a century of campaign finance law by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts on electioneering."" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had been the swing 5-4 majority to uphold campaign finance law. However, when she retired, Judge Samuel Alito Jr. was appointed (by former president George W. Bush) to take her seat. Justice Alito would become the swing 5-4 majority to strike down campaign finance law. The documentary asks: how was precedence overruled when nothing significant changed except for one justice replaced another? This is indicative of the extent of influence, and how the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land where the highest ethical standards can go awry on a given case. Republican planners took ""advantage of the [Supreme Court] decision by developing a sprawling network of nonprofit organizations [such as Citizens United and other super political action committee - super PACs] to funnel corporate cash into campaign commercials. The nonprofit organizations would simply be brands to conceal the true financiers of the advertisements,"" wrote Lee Fang. Citizens United provided a means for corporations to surreptitiously back a candidate or cause, to open the floodgates to big business influence, without the risk of public backlash. To reiterate, first, the governor took power away from the state's public-sector unions, then he weakened private-sector unions by signing ""right to work"" legislation. And, regrettably, he's not stopping there, next he plans to target college-faculty tenure as a means to rein in cost. The Koch Klan have put up $900 million to get their man, Gov. Walker, in the White House in 2016. If they succeed, the hoi polloi will be ruled by an oligarchy form of government. PBS wouldn't or couldn't broadcast this program, because David H. Koch is a contributor. Hopefully, this documentary does get televised by one of the major networks, so that the public can hear the other side and make a more informed decision or vote for 2016.",1434326400,4,3437,5.150268336314848
