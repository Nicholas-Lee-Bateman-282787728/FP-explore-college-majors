THIS product page - based on ASIN match and physical examiniation of the actual box and video - is for the UNRATED version.  Ron's 2-stars are therefore inappropriate and unfairly downgrade this specific product.  And, yes, we viewed the film for quality issues as part of our listing process (we are a seller), and we have to say that this is a pretty hot film.",1140307200,2,453,4.512195121951219
7921239,4,B00004RFFJ,"I really like this movie as it's not trying to make itself serious but it successfully registers as a movie with aimless fun. I like erotic movies that isn't serious but silly in a cute way,unless you have a Shannon Tweed as headliner.
I plan to shoot a movie of my own. Fun but really erotic.
For self-advertisement, I'm calling all those people out there  there who'd like to finance my movie here in my country. The budget is less than $10,000 but you're assured that it's going to be great - Very SEXY.

7921240,2,B00004RFFJ,"Once again the censors do a skin-o-max movie wrong. The reason most people rent or buy flicks like this is for soft-core / couples sexy viewing. We all understand that the plot and acting is typically low rate but we count on some camp, humor and of course some sexy people in sexy scenes. This R rated version up for sale here is cut to shreads! I suggest finding a store that carries the un-rated version where the sex is better and the views are not hampered by up-tight censors.",1053043200,6,482,4.366666666666666
7921241,4,B00004RFFJ,"I caught this movie late one evening and probably wouldn't have even bothered with it if hadn't been for the expression on one the actor's face's when he saw the Wax models of the Marquis de Sade and two serving girls come to life and get down to some real business on a large four poster bed.  I'm not normally into sex films but this movie actually was quite a lot of fun to watch and the acting was surprisingly good.  In the end the plot was pretty flimsy, with an emphasis on the cast to get their kit off in a variety of fun ways but it actually worked quite well.
Quite simply a group of four young people, all recently out of college go to a Wax Museum that has been left to one of them by their Grandfather.  It turned out that he had penchant for displaying some of historys more erotic figures in a variety of poses in his wax museum and with the help of a mysterious caped figure and a gold amulet, these wax figures come to life at night and enjoy themselves in the sexiest ways possible.  Through several escapades which include Romeo and Juliet, Anthony and Cleopatra etc we are treated to a little bit of a mystery, a snippet of drama, a bit of a love story and quite a lot of comedy mixed in with the more mature side of an adult film.  All in all it was quite enjoyable and I think I might be tempted to see the The Exotic Time Machine if I get the chance.",1052697600,6,1374,4.092936802973978
7921242,4,B00004RFFJ,"The Exotic House of Wax: Legacy of Lust is another enjoyable erotic film from the folks at Surrender Cinema. I actually liked the story, hokey as it was, but of course the script is really just a means to an end in this type of movie. Josie's grandfather Vincent dies and leaves her his beloved House of Wax. She, her friend Star (played by fan favorite Jacqueline Lovell), and two male friends vow to reopen the business despite the fact it is currently residing rather deeply in the red and a neighborhood group of uppity goody-goodies is determined to get rid of the place for good. This is no ordinary House of Wax, though. For one thing, Josie's grandfather had apparently been preparing to transform the place into an Erotic House of Wax. For another thing, it eventually becomes apparent, to the amazement of the four new business partners, that the wax figures in the museum sometimes come alive and fulfill whatever wax-fuelled erotic fantasies they have. When the secret of making the figures come alive at will is discerned, Josie and her friends seize the opportunity to save the House of Wax from bankruptcy and destruction.
This really is a fun movie. Watching the guys' faces when they first witness wax figures coming to life and performing in front of their eyes is pretty amusing. The talented Jacqueline Lovell is always a joy to watch, and there are plenty of sex scenes for almost all the characters to either gape at or engage in. The Exotic House of Wax is far better than most films you will find in this mature genre; it has everything most films of this type lack-decent acting, attractive ladies, an impressive number of quality sex scenes, and, it goes without saying, Jacqueline Lovell. Surrender Cinema, to my knowledge, never disappoints, and this movie does nothing to make me doubt my conviction of this fact.",1047168000,10,1842,4.759375
7921243,5,B00004RFFJ,"High Quality, that is for soft porn. Most of the people in the film can act. Most of the girls are real not silicone. The picture is clear, not grainy. The film has a plot that does more then just to serve up sex scenes. Don't buy it for the plot though, as if you would. The sex scenes are good, especially the four girl orgy. Everyone seems to be having fun and there is not a bored look to be found. The kink scene was nicely staged. The spanking lacked zest, but the candle wax was hot. This is the best ""sex"" movie in my collection.",1001203200,,537,4.02803738317757
7921244,4,B00004RFFJ,"This video will content every one that is looking for explicits erotic scene (including some strong girly ones). The story is a bit foolish but effective in bringing you where you want ! Beautiful girls ! The girls really seems to enjoy what they're doing,especially in the very hot scene of a lesbian foursome. I recommand it. Keep in mind that it's not a porno!",977270400,7,363,4.6
