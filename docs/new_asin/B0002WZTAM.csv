2128948,3,B0002WZTAM,"I did not find this film to be particularly erotic. I only found it to be sad. It did, however, have a few redeeming qualities.

The story is of a beautiful young woman in the porn business. She was not forced into it. The money is only part of it. She does it because she likes sex. She works on the internet and makes a good living. She also takes care of her father who suffers from Parkinson's disease.

Through the course of the film, she undergoes a character change. She decides to go into the PI business investigating men for infidelity and that takes her to some even uglier parts of life. She seems amoral but there is some character in there. The problem is she is not sure what she wants. She thinks she may have found a boyfriend but is not sure. The factors in her life, stress, taking care of Pops, an aides scare, physical danger and such prompt an even stronger character change. Most people would consider it to be for the better.

The end is ambiguous. You know she has cleaned up some aspects of her life but we are not really sure how thorough the cleaning is.

The film is well acted and well done. The drama is real and some of the action is graphic. It does what a drama should do in terms of generating character development and change. Still, sitting through it was a trial for me. I am glad to have seen it but I don't need to do it again.",1149379200,13,1367,4.206106870229007

2128950,4,B0002WZTAM,"In fact, ""This Girls Life"" seems to be two movies: first, it works over the relationships of internet pornstar Moon and the world around her - this part is truly great, with very well constructed characters (specially Moon herself and her ill father, played by James Woods) and cleverly avoiding making judgments about anything; the second, which comes up on the final third of the movie, is clearly weaker, more moralist and somehow desconstructing the characters so wonderfully built in the ifrst part.",1129939200,11,504,5.0843373493975905

2128952,1,B0002WZTAM,"This review refers to the uncut DVD version. Like the other reviewers here, I loved this movie. The movie I would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress Juliette Marquis (from Ukraine no less). The image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video. I can undertand and accept that. This DVD however is a lousy Pan and Scan version. Some movies can be Pan and Scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future TV transfers in mind. But this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and didn't make room for transfer to fullscreen TV. It is intensely frustrating to watch this damned DVD. You watch noses talking to half faces, half faces talking to ears, heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly. I am furious at the studio a__holes at Hart Sharp Video who sanctioned this Pan and Scan monstrosity. And they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen. To add insult to injury, they show pictures on the back cover and the insert, of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the Pan and Scan cropped crap. Hart Sharp Video goes straight to my list of Never Buy From Again. By all means see this movie - at the theater. Or wait till a more responsible company releases a new DVD edition.",1109635200,196,1403,4.571428571428571
2128953,5,B0002WZTAM,This is a great little independent film. I love it so much after I rented it so I decide to buy it.  A must see!,1106265600,8,112,3.48
2128954,4,B0002WZTAM,"THIS GIRL'S LIFE is a surprise little Indie that is well worth watching.  In a style not unlike a documentary Moon (Juliette Marquis, an impressive newcomer) shows us around a mini-camera rich home where she makes porn movies under the direction of Aronson (Tomas Arana), introduces her fellow porn stars and her friends (including Rosario Dawson as Martine), and ultimately brings us into her home life (she takes care of her Pops - James Woods - who suffers from Parkinson's Disease) and her past, including her reasons for entering into the porn star business.

Along the way she meets an ordinary guy Kip (Kip Pardue) who suggests that Moon may be ready for a relationship.  Moon's friends gradually introduce her to a new role of 'sex investigator', using her seductive powers to test their boyfriends' or husbands' fidelity. One of these adventures results in an encounter with one Terry (Michael Rappaport) who has abusive issues that alter Moon's perception of her role.

How Moon deals with the new direction her life is taking provides the climax of this film.  The movie is sparked by some very fine performances not only by Juliette Marquis, but also by James Woods, Kip Pardue, Ioan Grufford (Lancelot in KING ARTHUR), Rosario Dawson, and Tomas Arana.  THIS GIRL'S LIFE is an inside look at a thriving business that deserves this kind of examination.  Grady Harp, January 2005",1105833600,48,1389,4.961206896551724
2128955,4,B0002WZTAM,"i guess boogie nights opened the floodgates for these types of films, and some of them are actually worth checking out. i have to admit that i watched this movie while writing poetry and didn't really focus on it, but i got the whole reincarnation/transformation while living message, and i have to give kudos to ash for not pulling any punches with the sex, the scene at the opening of the film in which moon is getting banged from behind by some ananymous wasp hairy chested porn star was ballsy and realistic.... and all the more impressive is the fact that she delivered a monologue during the sex, wearing a cheesy blonde wig to boot. the kip pardue as himself thing was also clever... he was hilarious in rules of attraction... and he and moon made an attractive and realistic couple. definitely a dvd worth owning, and i expect hours of commentary by the director on the research and execution(i would love to know how many takes it took before moon could keep a straight face during the aforementioned blonde wig doggy style scene)bottom line... solid performances, realistic slice of the seedy side of porn.... and definitely pick this up if you are a fan of boogie nights, rated x, and films of that ilk, or if you have any curiousity about the sex industry in general.",1095379200,24,1279,4.638766519823789
2128986,5,B0002WZTAM,I liked this movie a lot. The acting was good and so was the story. James Woods was awesome in it.,1372291200,,98,3.7142857142857144
2128987,1,B0002WZTAM,"This Girl's Life has no real story, it just shows once again Girls being used by men.  No self-respect for themselves what-so-ever.  I do not recommend this movie and James Woods playing in this role was really a come down for a man who can act.  Why did he do the role?  Why bother making the movie, period?

2128995,5,B0002WZTAM,"Don't let the ""occupation"" of the star of the movie turn you off.  The movie does a wonderful job of showing the tender and loving side of Moon.

2129016,5,B0002WZTAM,"I did not think I would enjoy this movie but I absolutely loved it. To me the movie had more of an underlying meaning to it & as the movie progressed along it was revealed at the end. I thought the story line was good, kept me interested, was boring or slow at all. It told a story of a young girl that realized her path in life wasn't leading down the path she was looking for as a women and she changed it before things got bad.
Really good movie in my opinion.",1361836800,,463,3.9361702127659575
2129017,5,B0002WZTAM,"This movie looks precisely like something to kill an evening... I did not expect much and with a low bar - I expected the product to hit the mark.

Yet, this movie surpasses almost any bar I could have applied! Juliette Marquis is a true gem of an actress (why does she not act more?!). She is able to carve and deliver a difficult role through the process of numerous character changes and emotional reactions. The story is believable, dramatic, fun, dark and brutal with scores of humor thrown in via James Wood's character. At the end, you may be left in tears from joy or humor... but I for one was left with an unexpected smile from this surprising movie. Truly a hidden gem.",1349049600,,680,4.44
2129018,1,B0002WZTAM,"i've seen better acting in actual porn, and real porn actually has porn, instead of this whatever it is. and the old man with parkinsons is depressing as shit, i don't wanna see that.",1343865600,,183,4.411764705882353
2129019,1,B0002WZTAM,"The movie is trash - why James Woods (a favorite actor of mine) participated in this drivel is beyond me.  That said, Woods' gave an excellent performance - & it was only because of his ongoing role that I made it to the end - I wanted to see what happened (or as it turned out what didn't happen) to his character.  Alhough he didn't appear until much later in the film, Michael Rapaport also gave an extremely effective performance - as a ""sexually-rejected man turned into a would-be rapist"" - very scary.  As for the other actors/actresses, they were probably okay.  Ultimately, however, the movie lacked a credible ""storyline"".  An 18-yr old girl joins the porn industry because she loves sex. Five years later, she's a ""porn superstar"" who goes on a blind date with this somewhat nerdy guy - & the date transitions into an intimate, but sexless, relationship.  Meanwhile, she's still ""sexually selling herself"" - only now she's ""opened up her own business"" in which she ""hires herself out"" to entrap cheating spouses/significant others.  Her work seems to be bringing in a lot of money, yet she & her Parkinson-ridden father (who she supports)live in this run-down shack of a house, where the father, who is mentally & physically incompetent, is left on his own for hours at a time.  As at least one other Amazon reviewer has noted, where is her money going?  On top of all this, this movie is one of those movies that doesn't really have an ending. It just ""stops"" - with the porn superstar questioning the direction of her life.",1343779200,,1536,4.680297397769516
2129020,3,B0002WZTAM,"Can't give you the 75-300 word review, I'm to the point.  The movie is GOOD!  Not Great.",1289088000,,88,4.117647058823529

2129022,2,B0002WZTAM,"I picked up this flick from the recomendation of an educated female friend of mine. We were discussing the fact that since pornography is purely exploitive by nature it is immune from exploitation and therefore might be the last ""pure"" art in America ( in very limited examples). She recomended this film for it's take on the subject. Suffice to say this movie doesn't do or say anything that others haven't. It's got the eye candy and James Woods channeling Michael J Fox (too soon?) but is ultimately disappointing in it's pacing, dialogue, and content. As I understand it this is Juliet Marquis's  (a model from the Czech Republic I think) breakout role. She handles her part well; I personally could see her as the next Mila Jovovich B+ horror movie staple. In any case, if you're curious rent it then there's no shame in hitting stop early.",1254528000,2,845,4.70945945945946
2129023,4,B0002WZTAM,"This was a really good movie,it was more about her personal life than her job as a pornstar. The movie made a good turn in the middle when she became something like a private investigator. I would've liked to see more Rosario but she was in a few parts. Cheyenne Silver did a good job with her role as well,she has the talent to make it in the mainstream film business. The ending was...okay.",1247788800,,392,4.3108108108108105
2129024,5,B0002WZTAM,"It was an interesting view that not all porn is bad and not all porn stars are druggies and abused kids.  The premiss that porn in and of itself is not bad but the way its made and how the unhealthy enviornment of most porn is bad.  If some how it could be made a more 'main stream' industry it could be a healthy(er) and cleaner way of making a living.  The downside of the movie they leave it at that, no hard suggestions of how, hints of more female directors and producers, but just small hints of how.  All in all a good movie, better then others I have seen similar to this one.",1194739200,,584,4.052173913043478
2129025,1,B0002WZTAM,"Apart from James Woods, this was dismal. The Moon character is suppose to have this awakening and by the end of the movie be a woman. The situations she was put in were transparent and lacked any grounding in a rational mind. If she was this big porn SUPERSTAR then why can't she afford a nurse to care for her ""Parkinson's disease-suffering"" father when she is gone?  Would not starting a business based on trying to make people cheat be dangerous?  Would saying you can ""take on"" twenty guys be a bad move?  I know that was not Moon but the stupidity is not limited to her story. A little, and I mean VERY little, common sense would have put her in the same place that this lunatic story did.

Again and again the actions and journeys taken are unnecessary except as poorly executed attempts to emotionally manipulate the viewer. Just a touch of logic or common sense would have been nice. I don't sympathize with fools.",1175558400,2,922,4.502994011976048
8033832,3,B0002WZTAM,"Wow!  The line of demarcation between porn and  risque is scant to nonexistant.  Did I just watch a porno?
I thought this was a teen movie.  The cover picture was small on my screen.  I liked Horatio Hornblower.
I wanted something similar in the acting quality.  I got Horatio horny.  Don't get me wrong Ioan was very handsome.
His role was not devoid of clothing.  He is just such a captivating actor.  I just don't understand why, when given the
opportunity a director would not give him a role that is more substantial.  This movie had an interesting overall story.
I, personally, prefer depth over graphic nudity.",1486771200,,617,4.682242990654205
