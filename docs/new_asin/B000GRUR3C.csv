8134293,5,B000GRUR3C,"This was a great series, and it is so cute.  The main setting is a daycare of Muppet-like creatures who grapple with issues a three, four, or five year old might encounter.  Nice, not annoying (to me, anyway!) and faintly educational in terms of social development.  Fun, cute, and good for the car!",1193097600,2,299,4.60377358490566
