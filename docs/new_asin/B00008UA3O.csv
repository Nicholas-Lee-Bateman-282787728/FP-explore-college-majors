7986858,5,B00008UA3O,"""Friends"" is the TV series that needs no introduction. It's the show that has been a part of people around the world for a decade and even more. If for some stroke of bad luck you haven't seen nor heard about this show, you must have been a hermit or something close to that. But there is hope yet for you...

""Friends"" revolves around 3 guys and 3 ladies who became friends and grew together as friends through the years. It is a comedy show that, even with situations you'd think is near impossible from happening, is believably funny. What I believe made the show catch and keep its fan following is the dynamics of these six characters. Despite the similarity and difference in their backgrounds and views in life, they still stuck together. I think, and most people will agree with me, that the cast namely Jennifer Aniston-Pitt, Courteney Cox-Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer, made these characters real and they made it their own. The friendships onscreen went offscreen as well, as the actors are real-life friends who dealt with their issues as a group. And that made people get more and more fascinated by the show.

It ended after 10 seasons with lots of ups and few downs in the course of its run, to most of the fans' dismay.

If you want to have a go at where the show began and where most of the excitement in the show is, pick up Seasons 1, 2 and 3 together. Just to give you some memorable things to see in these seasons, I'm going to name a few: When Ross ""grabbed a spoon"" in the pilot episode, Chandler's ATM vestibule, Monica and Rachel's identity switch while on a date with doctors portrayed by ER actors George Clooney and Noah Wyle, Joey's acting, and Phoebe's SMELLY CAT (""smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?...).

There are loads of great episodes in these three seasons enough to turn that stress to fits of laughter.

A must to all ""Friends"" fans and a great entertainment package to everyone looking for a good laugh and a look at how great life is when shared with friends...",1093046400,,2060,4.54177897574124
7986859,1,B00008UA3O,"Every time I see the show Friends, I can literally feel myself becoming a bigger wimp.  I had the misfortune of seeing an episode of Friends last week; it wasn't pretty.  At first I didn't know what I was watching because I had tuned in in the middle of the show, but I immediately realized that it was Friends when realized I had been watching for over 10 minutes and hadn't even so much as cracked a grin.  The show just wasn't funny...at ALL.  The guys that play on the show completely insult my masculinity, and I think the only reason why the show has survived for so many years is because there are a couple of good looking actresses on it.  The solution: make shows with more ugly people in them.  This way, the shows that are stupid, un-funny, and lacking content will be cancelled immediately instead of dragging on for years at a time, filling time spots that could be filled with potentially great TV shows such as Seinfeld or The Simpsons (the two undesputed greatest TV shows ever made).  It's shows like Friends that are ruining this nation (the USA); turning men into women, and giving women the idea that they live on a set of a romantic comedy.  Friends is ruining lives, tearing apart households, and giving Americans bad names.  In short: DON'T PURCHASE THIS DVD SET.",1064275200,2,1286,4.532467532467533
