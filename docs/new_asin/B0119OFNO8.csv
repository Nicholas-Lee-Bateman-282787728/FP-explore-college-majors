8723887,1,B0119OFNO8,"The James Bond Collection Blu-Ray disk set provides exceptional audio (stereo and DTS HD Master Audio) and video reproduction for every film included in the collection except ""Quantum of Solace"", which is a region B disk and will not play on region A BD machines. The collection includes 23 of the JB films starting with ""Dr. No"" and ending with ""Skyfall"". The collection does not include ""Never Say Never Again"" but there is a placeholder for the ""Spectre"" Blu-Ray disk. For fans of the JB franchise, the Blu-Ray disks that will play on region A machines offer extras, subtitles in multiple languages, and are extremely well done. There are also Digital HD versions of each film, which can be streamed and watched on computers as well as mobile devices. For fans interested in a complete collection playable on region A BD players, this compilation will be a somewhat of a disappointment but the audio and video quality of the other films speak for itself.",1485734400,2,957,4.841463414634147
