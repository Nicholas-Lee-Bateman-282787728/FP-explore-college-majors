8566617,5,B001NJX6ZS,"Dark Imaginations is Anaar's passionate experiment into ritual and dance. She created it with full honesty and great intent. It is a continuation of her explorations into the intersection of Feri and the Arts. She took great care to make this DVD accessible to both the beginning dancer and the advanced practitioner.

Highlights of the DVD are two magickal performances done with new music specially written for Anaar by Pandemonaeon. The Obake Odori is very spooky and a treat for fans of her youtube video of the same name. The Chalice & the Blade is so powerful the energy exudes from the TV.

Also detailed and well demonstrated lessons for ""Mirror Work"" meditations for increasing confidence and improving posture. Amazing ""Ritual Theory"" in which techniques designed to draw out the numinous in a ritualistic fashion are demonstrated including a Welcoming Gesture, Setting Sacred Space, an Invocatory Gesture, The Working, and a Grounding. There is also a Technical Practice section demonstrating techniques to enhance your dark persona such as The Slide, The Bobble Head, The Spider, Hand Vibratos.",1237680000,,1106,5.242937853107344
8566618,5,B001NJX6ZS,"My daughter (11) and I enjoyed this tribal gothic belly dance instructional DVD from the point of view of a practicing Witch in the Feri Tradition. Anaar's skill as a priestess, dancer and teacher were evident as we worked through mirror work that improved our posture and technical demonstrations such as the slide. I personally enjoyed the techniques in ritual theory such as setting sacred space and grounding.
I connected to Anaar's style of belly dance in this DVD because her work is sensual, dark and expressionistic infused with passion that
touched the beginner like myself and will also inspire the advanced practitioner. The music by Pandemonacon that accompanied her as she preformed the skills taught on her DVD where thrilling and inspiring. Fear not this DVD is worth your hard earned cash.",1233619200,4,805,5.06015037593985
