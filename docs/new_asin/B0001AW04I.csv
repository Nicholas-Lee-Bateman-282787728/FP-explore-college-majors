1985425,5,B0001AW04I,"We should all be grateful to Dennis Potter, Mel Gibson, Keith Gordon and Robert Downey Jr for giving filmgoers the opportunity to see that films can be cutting-edge innovative and that they don't have to fit a formula mold.  The Singing Detective probably breaks every rule critics and audiences may have in their minds about the way a film should be, but I for one didn't care - it was a stimulating and drew me into its web right from the start.
Dennis Potter wrote a rich multilayered screen play that challenges and bedevils - watching it was work and fun and joy and emotive and playful.
Mel Gibson had the smarts to know how this film should be made and chose just the right people to pull it off, including himself as Dr. Gibbon.  People have commented over and over about how different Mel looks in this role, but I think Dr. Gibbon tells us a lot about who Mel Gibson actually is.
Keith Gordon worked his Fellini-like magic on the screen play and with the actors and never bowed to the common-place.  If you've ever seen ""Waking the Dead"", his touch in TSD is so present in the nuances of the dialogue and the darkness which he imbeds into the white-bright hospital scenes.  I had wondered how he would accomplish jumping back and forth from the various 'Dark' worlds, but then I noticed the small repetitions, played out verbally and visually over the course of the film.
Robert Downey Jr came roaring onto the screen creating every aspect of Dan Dark with perfection - I saw no flaws.  What I did see was his uncanny ability to hold Dan Dark's lightness just deep enough under the surface for us to wonder at first whether there was hope for him.  Donwey's skill with the physicality of a role was also very evident, especially during the first stages of Dan's illness and in the scene where in a scene with his mother.
The dialogue is witty but sometimes Dan is hard to understand because of his infirmity - the DVD has English subtitles if that's a problem.  Although I must say that as the film progressed, I realized it didn't seem to matter that I was missing a little dialogue here and there - the physical story telling took center stage a lot and as I said before themes were revisited to draw the collage together.  In the end I knew exactly what had been said intuitively.
A big plus is Keith Gordon's commentary.  One disappointment - I wanted Dan Dark to sing and dance more, but I know that wasn't the way to go.
I'm very clear that this rare breed of film should be revisited to get the full impact of its message of suffering, healing, love and redemption, so for me, buying it was a must.  You have to be willing to jump into the film - get in the middle it.  Besides wrongly holding TSD up against the mini-series, perhaps some of the harsher reviews are coming from those who subconsciously refused to take the plunge into Dan's world.  It's a pretty organic piece that deserves full tilt participation, if you want to experience its complete message - if you want to find more than clues.
See The Singing Detective with no preconceived notions and the desire to evolve your thinking about the anatomy of a film and you will have a jolly good time and maybe learn something about yourself too.",1080345600,4,3222,4.479522184300341
1985426,5,B0001AW04I,"I'm going to have to admit that I'm a huge fan of the multi-talented, gifted, and beautiful Robert Downey Jr. He is ""IT"" in my book.
I am also a huge fan of The Singing Detective. I've seen this film five times on the big screen and I'm about to see it several more times on DVD.
It pains me to admit that my husband didn't care for TSD the first time he saw it!
I should say he didn't care for MOST of the movie. He loved the music and he liked the ending, but the drive home from the theatre was a little difficult because he was very grumpy! To break the tension, I decided to turn on the TSD soundtrack since he seemed to love it so much!
Then I decided that it was time for him to get a little background on the film.

I thought I had already ""prepared"" him for it, but obviously I hadn't prepared him enough!! I talked to him about it - a lot. He listened. I explained a little bit about the medicine, Dark's hallucinations, the psoriasis, the detective book, the tremendous guilt Dark felt about his ""betrayal"" of his mother etc. I noticed he was becoming a little more receptive to chatting about this very compelling story.
A few days later, he started singing ""Three Steps to Heaven"" with a big smile on his face and told me that he ""just can't seem to get that song"" out of his head. He asked me if he could borrow the soundtrack to put in his car while he ran some errands. I told him he couldn't - I love it too much - but I let him take my car so he could listen to ""Three Steps to Heaven"" and the whole soundtrack again and again and again.
When he came back from running his errands, I said to him, ""It sounds like you might be changing your mind about this movie.""
He said with a big smile on his face, ""How can you get the guy with the psoriasis out of your mind?""
That was his word-for-word reply!
He was starting to ""get"" it! He was starting to ""get"" Downey!
Join the club!!!
We talked about it a lot more and he became very interested in the discussion!
Then he went off on another errand and listened to his precious soundtrack some more!
When he came home, he said, ""OK, I'm READY to see this movie now!""
We saw it together a second time! He loved it so much we went back a third time.
He's now a huge fan of the movie and of Robert Downey Jr!
The only way to FULLY appreciate this movie is to do a little homework on Potter. The audience has to be an ""informed"" audience. In the book Potter on Potter, Dennis Potter says, ""First of all, it's not in any sense a prcis of the original series, and secondly, it is totally rethought."" Keith Gordon has said many, many times that Potter wouldn't have been interested in a ""re-make"". He was very happy with the British series exactly as it was. Gordon said, ""By changing the whole format, he was, I think, trying to take his basic idea and style, and create something new. Sort of the way a composer might take a piano piece they've written and turn that into a symphony, using the same basic melody and structure.""
I'm so incredibly impressed with Potter's new The Singing Detective ""symphony""!
It was masterfully conducted by Keith Gordon.
Robert Downey Jr. gave the bravura performance of his career!",1080345600,3,3171,4.224052718286655
1985427,2,B0001AW04I,"Dan Dark, writer of noir, Raymond Chandler-esque Detective fiction is suffering from a severe skin condition that has made him virtually a prisoner in his own body.  Mentally, he dwells in the realm of his novel, The Singing Detective, where he is a suave, hard-boiled yet sensitive PI.  When forced to interact with the real world, Dark is obnoxious, angry and abusive.  When his condition fails to improve, his doctor prescribes psychotherapy.  Using his book as a key to his past, his therapist hopes to unlock Dark's subconcious and set him on the road to healing.
There were several good things about this movie.  The concept had a great deal of potential to be depthful and interesting.  The film-making was pretty interesting.  The performances were remarkable and Mel Gibson's make-up job was astounding.  But the movie as a whole didn't work for me because the overall story lacked a coherent dynamic structure.  The pieces worked, but they didn't fit together and I felt that some of them were missing.  I don't mind having to fill in a few blanks in a movie, but in _The Singing Detective_ I had the constant and unpleasant feeling that I wasn't quite sure what was going on.
The movie moves through three storylines:  the real world of Dan Dark in the hospital, the fantasy world of Dan Dark, The Singing Detective, and the memory world of Dark's childhood.  I didn't think the Detective world was given enough attention.  The story that was happening there was not entirely clear and there was little internal logic.  This frustrated me because it seemed to me that the detective world was supposed to be the place where the other two worlds met.  But since it had no solidity, it was only a tenuous bridge and the viewer was left to make up a lot.  I would have liked it better if the filmmaker had chosen to spend more time with the detective world and less time in the hospital.  Also, far too much time and detail was spent in Dark's memories.  By the time we got to the big revelation scene, it was redundant because we already knew what Dark was going to say.  There was no sense of climax, and the closure seemed contrived.
The murky story was muddied even further by a subplot that seemed to deal with Dark's paranoia about his present day life.  I think this could have been left out. Often there was no clear distinction made between what was really happening in the present-day world and what wasn't.  All in all, the film had such a surreal feel that, not only was it difficult to tell what was going on, it was difficult to care.
Watching _The Singing Detective_ was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with pieces that have intersting shapes but, when joined, give a picture of a Rorshach ink blot.  What the viewer gets out of it is probably his own business.  What I got was bored.",1080172800,3,2812,4.602409638554217
1985428,5,B0001AW04I,"Okay, forgive the cheesy noir title, but this was an excellent film.  This genre-defying film has so much sub text and eye candy and story that I must admit that it did not surprise me that Paramount did not release the film more widely.  The average moviegoer just wouldn't be able to wrap their mind around it.  Hearing about the film introduced me to the miniseries which I bought and then when the film was finally released, I had to drive from Birmingham to Atlanta to see it and then three months later drove to Montgomery to see it for the second time.  I am so excited to see it coming out on DVD.  Its only a shame more people haven't even HEARD of this movie.  The acting was wonderful, the humor sharp, the detective scenes wonderfully nastalgic, the music grooving, and the story thought provoking.  I can't wait to have the chance to see it again and again.  And running a third of the length of the original miniseries (and convieniently Americanized), it will prove to be an even more enjoyable viewing experience.  Find it, watch it, buy it!  Support this film!!!",1077148800,4,1079,4.544041450777202
1985429,4,B0001AW04I,"""The Singing Detective"" may not be an obvious pick for ""Best Picture of 2003"" honors, but it gets my vote for underground hit of the year. Hospitalized as the result of a rare skin disorder, novelist Dan Dark (Robert Downey, Jr.) drifts into a subconscious world of fantasy lore, and imagines himself as a gangster to escape the harsh reality of his existing condition. What follows is a drama/comedy/musical that'll have a dual effect on ""The Singing Detective""'s audience - in that it will have you both laughing and crying at the same time. To help the proceedings along, a semi-all-star cast is on hand, which includes Alfre Woodard (as a hospital chief of staff) and Mel Gibson (as Dan Dark's psychoanalyst). To top it all off, the film's soundtrack, featuring 1950s and '60s tunes helps paint a spectacular picture, in that it provides an interesting backdrop for the storyline. If there's one minor flaw to this picture, it would have to be the makeup job of Robert Downey, Jr.. In far-away shots, it looks perfect and masterful - but in closeups, it pretty much looks ""paint-by-numbers"" (nonetheless being unappetizing when one is consuming refreshments during the movie!). Nevertheless, ""The Singing Detective"", in terms of layout and cinematic preciseness, has Cannes Film Festival subleties craftfully etched inside its durable craftsmanship. Definitely worthy of at least two views at your local theater, and for your video library in the very near future!",1071187200,2,1468,5.095435684647303
1985430,5,B0001AW04I,"I just got back from seeing The Singing Detective.  I had to drive 152 miles to see it in a tiny little theater in Nevada City, California.  I have to admit that I am very much a Robert Downey Jr. fan so I was highly motivated.  I was captivated with the story.  I was prepared for it to jump from reality to fantasy so everything seemed to fall into place.  The acting was great ;  the cinematography , superb.  I just wish this film had a wider release.  It was well worth the drive!",1070064000,2,485,4.085106382978723
1985431,5,B0001AW04I,"I have been following this film since prior to the shooting of the film.  I am a faithful Downey fan and when I heard he would have the leading role in the movie version of Dennis Potter's mini-series I rented the mini-series to become familiar with the story.
It was a difficult story to follow and not too well received when it first was shown.  It later became highly acclaimed.  Ten years later, Dennis Potter wrote a film script, shortened it to a little under 2 hours (from the 6+ hours of the mini-series) and  changed the venue from England to the United States, actually the Chicago area;  the time period from the 40's to the 50's.  The tone of the story line changed somewhat also as basically it is actually about Dennis Potter.....and in his final years, he bacame less cynical and less angry than the original Phillip Marlow (Potter)...he mellowed somewhat. Consequently, the film has a different feel as was Potter's intent.  The script was not changed; only the location was changed to Los Angeles.
Robert Downey Jr. was brilliant....changing pace so smoothly from the psoriasis-ridden, hallucinating Dan Dark to the Private Detective who lip-syncs to the songs of the original artists of the 50's.  It is a complicated story line, not a senseless blockbuster type with little substance, not meant for the non-thinking viewer.  It was cast so well, Mel Gibson is fantastic as the psychiatrist, Dr Gibbon, Robyn Wright Penn, Carla Gugino and Katie Holmes were perfect in their roles.  Katie Holmes part was small but with a huge impact...and she did it so well, as did the rest of the cast.
Keith Gordon's directing was masterful, the timing with the musical numbers, the settings going from brilliant, stark white in the hospital, to dark streets and interiors with bright red accents....fast paced humor.
The closing scenes were perfect, then a rare treat.....Mr Downey singing ""In My Dreams"", a 50's song written by Gene Vincent, during the closing credits.  He has a wonderful voice...we need to hear more of him singing.
I have to give The Singing Detective 5 stars.....it was wonderful.  I have seen it 3 times, the second time in Chicago along with the Career Achievement Award presentation to Robert Downey Jr. prior to the screening.  That was a thrill!!  I will see it again Fri. Nov. 7.

Anyone trying to compare this with the orginal mini-series will miss the whole point of the story....Potter did not intend it to be a condensed version, rather a new aspect of the story.  Also, an interesting fact....after seeing Downey in ""Chaplin"",  Potter said he felt Downey would be the one to portray the character of Dan Dark.",1068076800,,2647,4.8337028824833705
1985432,3,B0001AW04I,"A disfiguring skin disease confines novelist Dan Dark (Robert Downey, Jr.) to a hospital bed for months. Embittered by his condition and paranoid about his wife's (Robin Wright Penn) fidelity, Dan hallucinates the plot of his first novel ""The Singing Detective"", replacing the characters in the novel with real people from his life. The resident psychiatrist (Mel Gibson) believes that the noir detective novel about a 1950's era ""gumshoe that warbles"" holds clues to Dan's paranoia and self-loathing. How much of the detective story reflects Dan's real life and how the two have become intermingled in his hallucinations remain to be seen as Dan slowly recovers.
""The Singing Detective"" is adapted from the 1986 television miniseries of the same name, written by Dennis Potter, who also wrote the film's screenplay. The film defies categorization, and it may take the prize for the most genre-crossing film that I have seen. ""The Singing Detective"" is a mystery within a mystery, a comedy, a psychological drama, and a musical. Yes, a musical. The plot is nonlinear, jumping back and forth between Dan's ordeal in the hospital, his memories, and his hallucinations of various times and places. It takes the audience the better part of the film to figure out how it all fits together. In this way, the film is like a jigsaw puzzle of Dan's mind...a mystery to be unraveled. The other mystery is the one Dan's fictional detective is simultaneously trying to solve. I'm not sure why Dennis Potter made the detective a singer. This introduces a musical element into a story that is already so overcrowded that it can be difficult to decipher. ""The Singing Detective"" is the most overtly Freudian movie I've seen in ages. In fact, if there is any film to which it can be compared, it reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"". Both films alternate between reality and stylized Freudian hallucinations. In both films, a man's past and his salvation, of  which even he is not aware, are to be found in his hallucinations and the mystery solved with the help of a sympathetic psychoanalyst. Unlike ""Spellbound"", ""The Singing Detective"" could actually be called overbearing in its style, though.
""The Singing Detective"" is genuinely hilarious at times. It elicited more than a few loud guffaws from the audience in my local theater. It's also to be commended for being clever and surprising. And Robert Downey, Jr. gives an impressive performance, as always. But the film's first act unfortunately does nothing to draw the audience into the story. On the contrary, it introduces some unattractive characters in a confusing manner and does more to put the audience off than anything. This may be attributable to the fact that ""The Singing Detective"" contains too much material for a film of this length, so it is obligated to dive right in instead of easing the audience into its frenetic mix of fantasy and reality. But if you get past the first half hour or so, it improves. Another element that is likely to alienate some of the film's audience is Dan's misogynistic tirades, which wore on my patience after a while. So I'm giving ""The Singing Detective"" a marginal recommendation. If you don't like non-linear methods of story-telling, garish imagery, and Freudian inferences, you won't like this film. If, on the other hand, you like (truly funny) cynical, vindictive, occasionally obscene humor and the aforementioned characteristics appeal to you, you might want to give ""The Singing Detective"" a try.",1066780800,7,3503,5.039655172413793
1985433,2,B0001AW04I,"The original BBC television series THE SINGING DETECTIVE, written by Dennis Potter, is by any standard one of the milestones of television.  It was a weird but spectacularly successful blend of hospital drama, film noir, psychological thriller, and surreal musical that managed to strike the right balance between its disparate elements to create something utterly unique and magical.  Michael Gambon was perfect in the lead, and he was complemented by a first rate cast, including Bill Patterson and Joanna Whalley.
Now we have a very odd thing indeed:  a film version of a television series, complete with an all star cast of such performers as Robert Downey Jr., Mel Gibson (all but unrecognizable behind a balding head of light brown hair and thick glasses), Adrien Brody, Robin Penn Wright, Alfre Woodard, Carla Gugino (of SPY KIDS fame), Jon Polito, Katie Holmes, and Jeremy Northam.  Despite a spirited, capable performance by Downey (talent intact after his incarceration) in the main role (Dan Dark, as opposed to the Philip Marlowe of the television series), the film simply isn't very successful.  I had such high expectations for this one!
So, why does this movie fail?  Primarily, two reasons.  First, the original series was 450 minutes long, while the movie is only 109.  In other words, the series had ample time to introduce the viewer to its strange, nightmarish, surreal world, while the movie, because of time limitations, simply plunges the viewer directly into the heart of things.  For anyone who has seen the series, it will seem as if the movie is constantly in a rush, and as if it is always leaving things out.  The movie comes across as far less varied and rich.
The other problem is that for the most part the movie lacks the energy and vitality of the series, almost as if there is less of a sense of what it is that they are trying to achieve.  One watching the series will recognize that without the deft touch exerted by Potter on the script, the show could easily degenerate into something odd and unpleasant.  This is precisely what happens in the movie.
One would imagine that with an all-star cast and a larger budget, the movie would at least be a far more attractive and visually compelling affair.  I actually prefered the hospital wards of the series.  The cast should have been an improvement, but I found nearly all the performers apart from Downey to be wasted in their roles.  About the only thing that I found better in the film was Downey's makeup.  The main character is suffering from an especially nasty case of psoriatic arthritis, and Downey does indeed look quite afflicted.  However, psoriatic arthritis is far more treatable today than it was during the time when the television series was set (one of my best friends suffers from it, and tells me about the medications that she uses in fighting the condition), so it didn't make as much medical sense now as it did almost twenty years ago.
My greatest fear about this film is that it will skew people's assumptions about the original series.  It is truly an unworthy successor, and I would urge everyone to see the original series, which is available on DVD.  Those who like the movie will love the original even more, and even those who hate the movie will love it.",1066694400,27,3272,4.779751332149201

He wrote detective novels that didn't sell. He tells his complaints to the medical personnel. They prescribe Librium and Valium. Then they break into a song from the 1950s!

Then he is singing a song from the 1950s! [Viewer discretion advised.] A nurse dons latex gloves to treat his skin disease. [There is another song and fantasy.] We don't have to talk about it. One doctor has a detective story by Don Dark and analyzes his personality and habits. Does a work of fiction tell about an author? Or the audience he writes for? Does a skin condition show an unclean mind? The talk pads out the story. [Does it make sense?] There is a scene from his childhood. To explain his character? Donnie goes to Los Angeles with his Mom on a bus. Back at the hospital Dan starts yelling and being disruptive. He is angry and shows a temper. Does he plan to get better? Does he need his head examined?

Don meets his wife in the hospital and insults her. Does she still love him? A company wants to buy his first novel to make a movie. Will he sign the contract? There is another scene, shots are exchanged, a man is hit. Dark talks to a client, then leaves. A woman follows him, there are shots. She mentions names before she goes. Back at the hospital Don answers questions. Any diagnostic value? Don remembers his past youth. Dons skin condition is clearing. His novel is placed on a computer. There is another scene in the hospital. Then a flashback to the past. We learn about Dons past and the death of his Mom. [Note Dons socks.] Why are his fists clenched? There is another flashback, a woman enters a room and sees a body. [Does the talk make sense?] Don leaves the closet and acts. Back in the hospital two men push his bed down the aisles. More songs! A man shows up, there is shooting. Believable? There is another song. Then it ends!

This must be the craziest movie Ive ever watched. Dont waste our time! Was it meant to be a modern opera with drama and song? It deserves to be a failure. Was it produced to create a paper loss to offset profits from another production? They missed a chance to recreate a modern version of a classic detective story from the 1930s or 1940s.

I was hesitant to watch it based on the BAD reviews this movie gets but after watching the first 11 minutes all I have to say is obviously (and sadly) this movie is not for everyone for certain reasons.

1- You have to either GET Sub realism or be ready to have an open mind. If you have never watched sub realism or don't have an open mind this movie will look like total nonsense and will bore you.
2- You have to think to watch this movie. In todays AD&D induced society with immediate gratification that's a challenge in and on itself. This movie CAN be entertaining but is not your run of the mill preprocessed Hollywood crap where everything is obvious.
3- Be prepared to follow a non linear narrative. If you are not used to dealing with this style of story-telling you'll lose patience, is a challenge but is worth it.

I've only watched the first 11 minutes of this movie and I love it. The scene in the bed is so good for two reasons. It exemplifies how important LISTENING to someone is and second it draws a critic of today's healthcare system that's engineered to get the most money out of people while treating them as a number without showing any compassion.

For that scene alone I HAVE to tell you, ignore the negative comments here as they're from people who either were expecting something else or simply are not ready for this kind of movie.
Now that I've watched more I can tell you the film is full of things like that one.

And ironically, at the 49 minute mark the ANSWER of why some people don't get/won't get this movie is actually discussed by Robert Downey and Robin Wright characters: All clues, no solutions. And that's exactly why I like it.",1415664000,,1690,4.403846153846154

His shrink is played by Mel Gibson, in an unorthodox role for him. Dark's novel is based on events in his childhood, making characters from people he had met. Danny is delusional and imagines things in the present, confounding the people in real life with the characters in his book. The dialogue in the movie is excellent. If you enjoyed the dark humor of the Joker in the Dark Knight, you will enjoy the ramblings of Downey early on.

1985478,4,B0001AW04I,"I've never seen the original BBC series by Dennis Potter, which I think helps me to see this version in a more objective light. My understanding is that this is not just a ""shortened"" version of the BBC series but rather a complete reworking by Potter himself (based on the script he wrote) which does in fact happen to be shorter in length. It seems the action has been moved--again, by Potter himself--from England in the 1940's to America in the 1950's, with songs appropriate to that time and place used to explore the motivations of the characters. Having listened to the director's commentary, it seems as though the director of this version was very concerned about staying faithful to Potter's words and intentions.

That said, I think the film can be enjoyed even by those who know nothing about its background. Yes, it's a little offbeat--a dark comedy in which the past and the present, as well as fictional worlds, collide in the mind of one physically and emotionally sick man, complete with stylized musical numbers that may seem to come from nowhere. But I thought it was quite good once I got into its spirit--funny, sad, surprising, moving, and ultimately upbeat without ever feeling forced, manipulative, or weird merely for the sake of being weird. I thought all the actors were excellent; Robert Downey Jr. as the vitriolic writer at the center of the action and Mel Gibson as the awkward therapist who tries to help him stand out especially.

I wrote this review to give people a different perspective from the single previous review, in which this version was compared to the original BBC series and came out the worse. I feel that this version is not simply a ""remake"" or an ""update""--implying it's a cheap knock-off made to squeeze more money out of the franchise--but rather a new examination of the story by the same author in a different time and place. I think people who give it a chance without constantly comparing it to the older version will be pleasantly surprised.",1231027200,7,1999,4.77456647398844
1985479,1,B0001AW04I,"In the world of writer Dennis Potter (PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, LIPSTICK ON YOUR COLLAR), upbeat songs are used to contrast the gloomy lives of Potter's downbeat characters. Keith Gordon's adaptation of Potter's THE SINGING DETECTIVE stands in the mighty shadow of the acclaimed 6-hour BBC television production (1986). I suppose Gordon's effort should be judged on its own merits, but since I saw the BBC miniseries first, it's impossible for me not to draw comparisons.

Robert Downey Jr. plays a writer hospitalized for an extreme case of eczema, a skin disease that results in inflammation and scaliness (in real life, Potter suffered from the same disorder). During his stay, Downey, a miserable misogynist, frequently escapes into the fictional life of his alter ego, a singing detective. In these fantasies, he finds himself confronting many long-suppressed emotional issues.

The BBC version had the luxury of exploring its protagonist over a six-hour duration, allowing lead actor Michael Gambon to infuse his character with the sort of subtle shadings that are nowhere to be found in this remake. With only 108 minutes to cover the same ground, Robert Downey Jr. turns in rushed, one-note performance, though probably not through any fault of his own. But he's still one cranky jerk and after a while, even the most indulgent viewer will lose interest in him, and begin wondering why they should care about any of his whining. Without the key ingredient of audience sympathy, Gordon's film implodes.

In Gordon's defense, Dennis Potter's work is notoriously tricky to adapt; Potter's writings are populated by unappealing souls and his technique of allowing songs to convey a character's suppressed emotions is a conceptual conceit that can--and often does--grow tiresome. When it's done correctly, however, it makes for compelling, disturbing entertainment. For that reason, I advise you to skip this film, and check out the BBC version of THE SINGING DETECTIVE and the underrated Steve Martin film PENNIES FROM HEAVEN.",1226361600,5,2025,5.282608695652174
1985480,4,B0001AW04I,"This movie didn't seem to get very good reviews. After seeing it myself, I'm stumped. It's malevolent and weird, but it certainly isn't dull; it's surreal, but not to the point that you can't tell what's going on. Plus, the acting is great and the concept disturbing. As unpleasant as parts of it were, I'm going to watch it again.
Part of the problem is, this movie is a remake of a much better TV series. The TV series ran 7 1/2 hours, and this movie has *somehow* been cut down to 2. Okay. You can guess what happened. In an attempt to trim off fat, they whittled the plot down to an incomplete skeleton. But it all still makes sense, and I enjoyed doing my own job of guessing and reconstruction.
I think the other problem is that people see the title, and expect a fun, flashy crime story. This movie is not what you'd call ""fun"", unless you love a good Lynch or Cronenberg marathon.
Also, if you want to ogle Robert Downey Jr.--and that's a good and admirable pastime, I applaud it--this movie will bother you. He spends most of it looking like he's in the last stages of radiation poisoning. His dreamworld alter-ego is handsome, but played as a flat-voiced, shiny-eyed Invasion Of The Body Snatchers doppelganger.  I had to remind myself that it was only an actor in makeup; the illness portrayed here is horrible seems very real. Downey is ferociously good, filled with rage and scorching the paint off the walls, and it's disturbing.

Yeah, Downey is great in this; he goes from a sick, vicious, venomous invalid in the first half to a slightly-less sick, more charming, more frightening nut case in the second half. More frightening, as he becomes less insane? Absolutely. In the first half of the movie, you know what he will do--he's going to break every bone in your body, if he could just get past the pain enough to lever himself out of bed. In the second half, he is a gentler lunatic, still lashing out, but also experiencing moments of dotty clarity; he is picking up pieces of his own broken mind and saying ""Oooh. Look at that."" Watching the expressions flicker across Downey's face is amazing. There is a moment when his wife says something to him, something innocent which still brings up a flare of insanity. You see a blaze of fear and paranoia, an ""Uh oh, what am I doing?"" moment, then a forced calm as he reminds himself that he shouldn't follow that impulse.
Anyway, enough. I highly recommend this movie if you like good acting, if you like being disturbed, if you want some Twilight Zone to chew on. It is much more unnerving than some horror films I've seen, and the ending is happy in a horrifying way. Go ahead, it's great, you just have to like this sort of thing and be in the mood for it. Watch it on Halloween, I dare you.",1220313600,15,2760,4.474206349206349
1985481,4,B0001AW04I,"What can I say? I was a Singing Detective virgin, being ignorant of the British TV show or the story line. I bought it for Robert Downey, Jr. It is weird, disturbing and pulls you in like a moth to a flame. I have watched it several times now, getting a little more understanding every time I do. My favorite scene is the Mr. Sandman number. How funny!

The acting is supurb; why this didn't get any critical acclaim is beyond me. Robert Downey Jr proves, yet again, that professionally no one can touch him. He is a rare class of actor that can deliver any range be it humor or tragedy. This role had to be a challenge though with the total body make up needed for Dan Dark's horrible skin condition; not to mention the emotional roller coaster the character is on. The man appears to cry real tears at one point! Kudos RDJ!! I wish The People could vote for Oscar winners and not ""The Academy"". There would be a lot of different winners. RDJ would have several of the gold guys on his mantelpiece if I had anything to do with it.

I don't care for the ending at all; I probably don't totally understand it yet. For a SD newbie, trying to figure out which scene is in Dan Dark's tortured mind or is for real is part of the fun of this film. I intend to see the British series as soon as I can. Maybe I can understand the ending better. Hummm......

It's not for everyone but for those willing to take a risk and actually have to think about a story rather than just watch it, oh, do try this film.",1213315200,8,1498,4.176470588235294
1985482,2,B0001AW04I,"I'm a huge Robert Downey, Jr. fan, but this movie did not live up to my expectations.  I found it tedious and boring for the most part.  I guess every great actor has an occasional bad movie.",1178409600,,191,4.135135135135135
1985483,4,B0001AW04I,"The film is a strange animal, all right, a work sans genre, and at times Gordon seems to have overreached himself, grasping for effects he isn't quite able to achieve. The various styles, moods, and genres give the film a slightly garish, amateurish feel, yet in the end (perhaps consciously on Gordon's part) this very awkwardness works in the film's favor. The Singing Detective is a remarkably ingenuous work, fresh and daring, almost childlike in its lack of pretension, and easily one of the most original American movies of the last twenty years. Above all, it showcases Robert Downey Jr.'s raging, embittered psoriasis-afflicted pulp writer, inside whose head the whole movie (more or less) takes place, and Downey gives an inventive, powerful performance, what may be the apotheosis of his enormous talent. Praise for Downey notwithstanding, on its release Gordon's film met with a wall of critical resistance, a veritable consensus of contempt. This may have been due in part (in the UK at least) to a fondness for Potter's original TV series; but it was perhaps due even more to the basic incompatibility of Potter's idiosyncratic, scathing vision with mainstream (critical) tastes.  Whatever the case, the movie once again tragically failed to find its audience.

As with his previous adaptations, Gordon respected the source material without revering it, and as a director, he has a rare gift: the ability to fuse his own sensibility and talents with his subject at a fundamental level. In the case of The Singing Detective, it was a somewhat less seamless fusion; Potter's vision (his bizarre blend of musical fantasy with bleak psychological realism) was so startlingly original it required another sensibility at least as strong and eccentric to fuse with. Gordon doesn't quite possess (yet) the surrealist gifts to make Potter's vision his own, or to take it to the next level (David Lynch might be the only director capable of that). He's a proficient director in every way, and seems to be blessed with a natural rapport with actors (perhaps why so many good ones want to work with him). Yet Gordon isn't a visionary director, and this was a visionary script. Fortunately, he had a visionary actor at a career peak to take up the slack, and Downey carries the day.

The Singing Detective isn't a masterpiece; it's flawed and fractured and at times thin, even facile and occasionally redundant (most especially in the pseudo-noir sequences). But it's an imaginative and fearless piece of cinema, an admirably eccentric work that manages to do something like justice to a brilliant piece of writing. Full of inventive delights and heartfelt touches, it leaves most other recent American films in the dust. Yet it flopped badly, both in the UK and the US, being so poorly reviewed that many people (myself included) gave it a miss, wary of the stench of failure. As it happened, the bad smells came not from the film but from critics too corrupt and jaded to recognize a work of art when they saw it.

(Excerpt from ""True to the Muse: Keith Gordon's Life on the Fringe,"" from DOGVILLE VS. HOLLYWOOD, by Jake Horsley)",1155686400,7,3131,4.958095238095238
1985484,4,B0001AW04I,"Few if any reviewers here indicate having watched Keith Gordon's director's commentary on this DVD. I think it would alter some of their judgements. As Gordon explains, the film script was in fact written by Dennis Potter, whose original ""Singing Detective"" ran as a much longer miniseries on British TV 20 years ago, and the changes to an American setting with 1950s American pop music were really Potter's own ideas. If the transition to feature film format loses something in the translation, it is in part due to his reconceptualization of his original creation.

As the commentary reveals, much of the inventiveness in this new version is not apparent in a single viewing. While it may seem to truncate and over-simplify the lengthier TV version, there is still complexity and ambiguity enough to entertain and engage a thoughtful viewer appreciative of good screenwriting and wonderful performances. Robert Downey's dual role as the embittered writer and the Bogart-style detective of the title reveal the mercurial range of this amazing actor, and his scenes with Robin Wright Penn, who plays his wife, are a brilliant portrayal of two people equally matched in their struggle to preserve a relationship and, at the same time, the integrity of themselves as individuals.

Strong cast. Interesting contrast of visual styles. Rated R for a wide range of disturbingly graphic and lurid visual imagery, including the main character's horrific skin condition. Granted, this ""Singing Detective"" is no substitute for the original, but seen on its own merits, it still stands up well on its own.",1148083200,23,1594,5.174418604651163
1985485,3,B0001AW04I,"The tagline for this film tells you everything - ""all clues, no solutions."" It never does clearly reveal which parts of the story are reality and which parts are merely the products of Dan Dark's fevered imagination. This is frustrating on some level, but it also spurs a lot of questions and post-viewing conversation.

Robert Downey, Jr. uses his unique intensity to good effect here; who can doubt Downey as a tortured but brilliant man on the edge? It's fun to see well-known actors in the other parts, especially Adrien Brody, although Robin Wright Penn seems out of place - she's too spare and sharp to have the right noir look, especially in the sexier scenes. Carla Gugino, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect in each of the roles she plays.

I haven't seen the original British mini-series, so I can't offer comparisons there, but I will say that this film makes me curious to see the other. I don't think that the film is a ""failure"" outright, but it does leave the reader with so many clues and so few solutions that I can see how it would have had a lot of trouble finding an American theatre audience. Still, I think it draws the viewer in with its strange fusion of plots and genres.",1139616000,2,1202,4.534562211981567
1985495,2,B0001AW04I,"So many reviewers so far point out that 'The Singing Detective' is inferior to the 1986 TV mini-series starring Michael Gambon.  On the other hand, there are some who defend this newer Robert Downey Jr. version on the ground that it has its own charms, mostly about its quirky nature.  I happened to be interested in the film after seeing the cast without knowing the background history of the film including all about Dennis Potter.  Now I've seen it, and I was intrigued with the unique world at first, but sorry, that didn't last very long.

Actually, I'm impressed with certain things.  No matter what people say, Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic actor, and he shows it as Dan Dark in a hospital bed.  His pains hiding behind his arrogance can be easily felt thanks to his powerful acting and good make-up jobs.  I have nothing against the other cast which is also impressive -- from reliable Robin Wright Penn to Mel Gibson with a bald wig on his head.  Even Katie Holmes is good, but perhaps the truth is, she can be good if she wants to.

But even if you have not seen the original TV like me, you would soon realize the defects of the film.  Im short it needs more time.  So many characters are made to appear in Dark's two worlds, reality and fantasy, that they are all reduced to insignificant cyphers.  Alfre Woodard appears fleetingly, and is gone.  Adrian Brody and Jon Polito appear as Hoods, and ... what did they do?  Nothing that I can remember.  Jeremy Northam?  Where is he?

But more fundamental trouble is the relation between Dark and the doctor played by Gibson.  For all Gibson's good acting as oddball Dr. Gibbon, Dark's psychological process to find the true problem about his over-aggressive mind through his ficional noir world looks too contrived here, and is given too short time to convince us.  Even the musical sections, though themselves good, look mercilessly cut short.  Director Keith Gordon does his best, but if you see too short musical parts (Danny and the Juniors' hit 'At the Hop' for example) it is obvious that the film's budget was limited.

I'm not telling you 'The Singing Detective' is a bad film.  Rather, it is an example showing that with a wiser decision of the filmmakers, this could have been much better.  Why not longer version instead of just 110 minutes?  But perhaps, like Billy Bob Thornton's 'All the Pretty Horses,' the exectives would not allow that.",1131062400,,2414,4.652482269503546
1985496,3,B0001AW04I,"Robert Downey, Jr. (Two Girls and A Guy, In Dreams) plays Dan Dark, a man who is in the hospital because he has a bad skin disease which Dark says in the movie ""Pizza Face"". Dark goes into his own mind where he remembers things about his childhood and his book, The Singing Detective comes to life, even the characters appear in front of him. Robin Wright Penn (The Pledge, She's So Lovely) plays Dark's Wife, Mel Gibson (Lethal Weapon 1-4, What Women Want) under makeup plays Dark's Doctor, Katie Holmes (Batman Begins, The Gift) plays one of Dark's Nurses and Adrien Brody (The Jacket, The Thin Red Line) and Jon Polito (With Friends Like These...The Crow) portray gangsters.

I can say though, it was a very, very , very strange movie. One minute the tortured patient (Robert Downey) is surrounded by doctors, the next- they're all singing and dancing 'the hop' while the hospital room morphs into a dance floor. It then goes into some distasteful scenes with more Robert Downey as he investigates who he is- a patient or a  detective from his own novel. Mel Gibson's tiny role as the psychotherapist was to help explore that. Carla Gugina's tiny role was as his mother in his earliest memories- whom he thought commited suicide, but is now figuring out she was murdered. If you're a fan of Mel Gibson or Carla Gugino, I would suggest strongly that you pass on this one.",1112400000,,1071,4.578125

There's something wrong witht this movie and I can't quite put my finger on what it is.

Robert Downey is a fine actor and does a good job with a tough role as  Dan Dark, a writer in the hospital suffering from a combination of arthritis and psoriasis gone beserk. He looks ghastly, feels ghastly and behaves viciously towards the hospital staff who force him to see a psychiatrist played astonishingly by Mel Gibson. Betweeen Mel's acting and makeup you'd never know it was him.

Dan is in such pain that he's hallucinating and when he's not doing that he comforts himself by thinking about his first book, The Singing Detective. It's set in the 50s and all the songs Dan sings come from that era as well. As he get's better and reluctantly works with the doctor Dan is forced to relive the worst thing that ever happened to him.

The movie largely stays faithful to the original material but somehow I didn't feel the same sympathy for Robert Downey's version of the character as I had for Michael Gambon. The father isn't as tragic and the mother didn't have the same impact. Robin Penn playing the ex wife was extremely unattractive. And the ending came just a litte to easy in this version and would tick off anyone who's been seriously ill either physically or mentally.

This version of Singing Detective is like Brahms being played by a music box. It's music but it doesn't compare to Brahms being played by a great musician. Buy the Gambon version instead or just watch this one on TV.",1104019200,3,1742,4.496835443037975
1985499,4,B0001AW04I,"Admittedly, I haven't seen the original British miniseries, nor had I even heard of it before renting this movie. If you're in a similar situation, I'd definitely recommend giving this film a shot.

Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant in his role as Dan Dark, a mystery novelist hospitalized with a rather nasty skin disease. A bespectacled and bald Mel Gibson, looking for all the world like a senior citizen, is also excellent in a supporting role as Dark's therapist.

Overall, a top notch movie that provokes quite a range of emotions.",1102809600,6,534,4.857142857142857
1985500,3,B0001AW04I,"When ""The Singing Detective"" was first produced as a TV mini series in 1986, it had a cumulative running time of well over 400 minutes.  In this theatrical remake, the story has been pared down to no more than 106.  I haven't seen the original - which enjoyed almost unprecedented critical acclaim in its time - so I have no idea how much of its quality has been lost  in its currently truncated form.  Hence, I will only be talking about this expurgated version, which stars Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson, both in virtually unrecognizable roles.  It should be noted that the screenplay is credited to the late Dennis Potter, the author of the original work, so we can assume that director Keith Gordon simply cut and pasted - though a less charitable person might say ""bowdlerized"" - the much longer teleplay.

""The Singing Detective"" tells the surrealistic tale of a writer of detective fictions who is suffering from a horrifically painful and disfiguring skin disease.  As he lies in his hospital bed, his mind drifts back and forth between reality and fantasy, a hallucinatory condition brought on by fever and his own author's imagination.  At times, Dan is  acutely aware of his miserable situation in the here and now, with all its attendant physical and psychological agony.  At other times he becomes lost in re-enactments of key scenes from his gumshoe fictions, memories of his miserable childhood, and elaborately staged song-and-dance numbers in which the characters lip-synch to musical standards from the `40`s and `50`s.

Because its style and subject matter are somewhat off-putting at first, ""The Singing Detective"" takes a bit of getting used to, but eventually the themes and stylistic elements begin to come together and the film takes off.  The irony is that, for all the razzle dazzle of its form and style, the film is at its most intriguing in its quieter, subtler moments when the embittered hospital patient is forced to confront the demons of his own tormented psyche.  Dan Dark is a man who obviously prefers the world of fantasy to the cold harshness of an often excruciatingly painful reality.  In addition to his debilitating disease, Dan is also haunted by a failed marriage and an often tragic childhood that he tries to ""correct"" by entering the world of idealized fiction, one that he can manipulate and control.  As the bombastic hospital psychologist figures out, Dan's illness is essentially psychosomatic in nature, one rooted in his inability to accept the realities of life in his own skin.  In fact, Dan ultimately discovers that his disease is as much a product of his imagination as the scenarios and characters that make up his fiction.  The illness becomes his way of not having to deal with his inner torments.  Somewhat paradoxically, his writing becomes a form of therapy for him, helping him to deal with all that unresolved bitterness in his soul.  The film is as much about psychological healing as it is about physical healing.  Oddly enough, Dan's confrontations with his wife, psychologist and other hospital staff are actually far more interesting than what is happening in his rather puerile imagination.  Still, towards the end of the film, when Dan starts to make some profound psychological breakthroughs, the fantasy scenes actually do begin to work and the complex structure pays off.

Downey does a fantastic job bringing Dan to life, conveying both the physical and emotional anguish the character is undergoing.  Gibson has a great deal of fun playing the part of a paunchy, balding psychiatrist whose unorthodox methods wind up getting to the root of his belligerent patient's troubles.  Robin Wright Penn, Jeremy Northam, Adrian Brody, Katie Homes and Alfre Woodard among others all deliver top notch supporting performances.  And special praise must surely go to the large makeup staff whose work here is nothing short of miraculous.

""The Singing Detective"" will probably not satisfy diehard fans of the original lengthy mini series.  But for the rest of us who have seen no other version than this one, the film's audacious style and complex themes help the movie ride up and over its not inconsiderable flaws.",1100044800,7,4185,4.992795389048991

  He has a problem with women, especially his wife (Robin Wright). It goes back to when he was a child when adults would have sex in front of him of near him.

1985502,1,B0001AW04I,"I was all set to really enjoy this movie after watching the mini-series of the same name for the 2nd time (a rare thing for me).  I thought the original was one of the finest works ever to grace the TV.  However, the movie was a real disappointment.

I knew going in that the story had been changed somewhat to a different time & place with different music.  But unfortunately, the differences between this movie and the mini-series were all for the worse.

The story has been changed in some subtle and not-so-subtle ways.  One big difference is that the lead character is in a private hospital room, which takes away much of the give-and-take dialog and atmosphere of the original.  The original's use of sex scenes, while provocative for the TV, was quite mild compared to the much more flagrant incestuous and Oedipal scenes in the movie.  The movie is much more dark and unredeeming in general.  Finally, while I like R. Downey, he was a very poor substitute for Michael Gambon in this part.  He was really completely unbelievable as a frustrated author - not that a better acting job would have made this a decent movie - I got the sense he was reading his lines off a teleprompter.

The cast in general looked good on paper, but again, they weren't enough to save this stinker.

I don't know exactly why this version was so much worse than the original.  Whether the author's rewrite, the shorter format, the director, or Hollywood in general are to blame.  But it is hard to imagine anyone liking this version anywhere near as much.

I actually had to stop watching this movie before the end (another rarity) - it was painful.  I'm using the time I saved to write this review and try to help others avoid my mistake.  What Hollywood did to The Singing Dectective was a crime.",1096848000,6,1783,4.556603773584905
1985503,1,B0001AW04I,"I've never been much of a Robert Downey Jr. fan. All I heard was praises for him in this film, and I must say I was disappointed when this movie never came to theater when I first heard about it over a year ago. You would have thought with a movie with this kind of cast including Downey, Mel Gibson, Katie Holmes Wright Penn, and Adrien Brody would have made this movie shine. It's anything but that.

Dan Darko(Downey) is an author. He's in a hospital for some kind of skin condition that they never explain how he got. He is stuck in the hospital and he hates every minute of it. He starts to hullicinate and live out the novels that he's written. He's not sure what is fake and whats not except for the visits from the few people he sees.

Dr. Gibbons(Gibson) is the closest thing that Darko has to a friend. He really does want to help him out, and the two really do play some interesting mind games out with each other. Gibbons is trying to help him overcome his illusions and get himself back into the real world.

The real world isn't what Darko likes. His nagging ex-wife(Wright Penn) is hanging around with ulterior motives. He does however enjoy his daily rubs with skin cream from Nurse Mills(Holmes).

However it's up to Darko to overcome his problems. He's living out painful memories from his life and he must make the descion to solve the problems and get back to reality or stay in the dream world he hates.

The worst part of this movie is the organization of it. It's really messy at times. You don't know what is going on and the jump to reality and fantasy is non stop. It's to much of an effort to try to keep up with it. It's not thats it to complicated but it's boring and stupid.

I enjoyed parts of the script. I loved some of the conversations between Darko and Gibbons. Gibson and Downey are both great in those situations. The rest of the script is a waste.

The acting isn't bad in the movie, but it's nothing to write home about. There is so much wasted talent in this picture. This movie is really a waste in something that could have been so much better. I really only enjoyed one part of the movie and that is the scene and dance sequence with Katie Holmes. The rest of the movie really is crap to me.

1985504,4,B0001AW04I,"The Singing Detective is a frantic, high energy and very weird cinematic experience. Dennis Potter wrote the screenplay for the film in 1992, two years before his death, based on his own 1986 BBC miniseries of the same name. Potter, who suffered from the same skin disease as our main character, very much wanted a feature film version of his miniseries, which may or may not closely resemble his own life. The script kicked around Hollywood for nearly a decade before director Keith Gordon, star Robert Downey Jr., and producer Mel Gibson became attached. The result is a fine example of entertainment - an eclectic mix of drama, film noir, and comedy, with plenty of fantasy musical numbers thrown in for good measure.

Robert Downey Jr. gives a truly amazing performance as Dan Dark, a pulp fiction author who is flat on his back in a hospital, suffering from a debilitating skin condition. If anything, his mind is in worse shape than his body. As he slowly recovers, he imagines scenes from his first novel, The Singing Detective, with himself as the lead character. His ex-wife, Nicola (a beautiful Robin Wright Penn), visits him at the hospital and plays a key part in his frantic imagination. He also has dreams and visions of his childhood, where he sees his mother (Carla Gugino) have an affair with his father's partner, Mark Binney (Jeremy Northam). His psychotherapist, Dr. Gibbon (an almost unrecognizable Mel Gibson), believes that things he experienced as a child have led to his sudden outbursts of violent temper. It is Gibbon's job to heal Dan's mind in tandem with his recovering body. Katie Holmes, as a nurse caring for Dan, Adrien Brody, and Jon Polito, as a pair of hoods, round out the excellent cast.

The Singing Detective is definitely different from any film to come out in recent years. It has a bizarre David Lynch like quality and a refreshing weirdness. The script is jumbled and moves frantically from one thing to another, but its gorgeous style, energetic performances, and fantastic musical numbers keep it entertaining. I wish it were a bit longer so I could understand the story a little better, but seeing this has made me desperate to seek out the original miniseries, which I have yet to see. The pacing can sometimes become tedious, and the concept of the film can be challenging for those unfamiliar with the source material, but ultimately ""The Singing Detective"" is a visual delight and an acting tour-de-force. It is one of the most unique films I have seen in years and I'm sure glad I saw it. Not recommended for everyone, but worth a try.",1092355200,4,2588,4.800448430493273

Writer Dennis Potter re-works his TV mini-series into a fine film, mingling musiclas, film noir and a good human drama.  Robert Downey, Jr., is excellent as Dan Dark, suffering both with the terrible skin condition an with his deep-seated emotions behind the characters in his first book.  His delivery of Potter's fast-paced dialogue as well as his finesse with the character are amazing.  Probably one of his best performances.  The supporting cast also gives fine performances that truly enhance the film: Mel Gibson as Dr. Gibbon; Adrien Brody and Jon Polito as the two bumbling hoods; Katie Holmes as Nurse Mills; Jeremy Northam as Mark Binney; and Robin Wright Penn as Nicola/Nina/The Blonde.  The makeup is also wonderful, especially both the work done to give Downey, Jr. psoriasis, and the almost unrecognizable Mel Gibson.

1985506,5,B0001AW04I,"This film is not anything like the 1986 British mini-series. This shorter version is a daring and mostly successful attempt by director Keith Gordon to fuse all the elements of the story into a madcap collection of tough reality and odd hallucinations. Dan Dark (Downey) is a bedridden author severely disabled by the worst case of psoriasis imaginable. He refuses any medication and thereby experiences hallucinations - or reality - or stories for his next book? Director Gordon teases us through out the movie. Downey is exceptional as the acid tongued, highly emotional, screaming patient who has a wisecrack quip for any lowly doctor or nurse that comes his way. He verbally abuses his wife who can barely keep up with attacks, but sometimes shines through when needed. There's a lot of paranoia in this story and the 40's film clips where Dan Dark is the detective investigating some murders is part tongue in cheek and part possible reality. The scenes are chunks of 40's detective clichs thrown into a series of sentences. It's masterfully amusing. When Downey gets nearly unbearable to watch as the pain stricken patient, the film switches to a hallucinatory dance and signing number driven by Dan Dark's imagination. Sometimes it seems like a diversion and other times it's sheer brilliance. All the actors, Robin Wright Penn, Adrien Brody, Katie Holmes and Mel Gibson (as the nearly unrecognizable psychiatrist) do masterful jobs and Dennis Potter's dialogue is amazingly crisp.

1985508,4,B0001AW04I,"The 2003 film version of THE SINGING DETECTIVE is by turns funny, scathing, and poignant, a woefully underrated look into a writer's psyche. If you don't have time to watch Dennis Potter's landmark TV miniseries (also available on home video), Potter's screenplay for this movie version (written 2 years before his untimely death) does a great job of condensing the story of novelist Dan Dark's (Robert Downey Jr.) battle with severe chronic psoriasis and personal demons. Throughout the movie, the bitter, suffering Dark weaves in and out of reality and delirious re-imaginings of the people and events in his life as they'd appear in the titular novel starring Dark's tough private eye alter ego. Actor-turned-director Keith Gordon stages this wild ride through Dark's mind with a style that owes as much to David Lynch and the Coen Brothers as it does to Potter. The British miniseries' lip-synched 1940s musical set pieces are retooled as American 1950s rock 'n' roll numbers -- call me a Philistine, but I think the updating works even better than the original (and believe me, I loved the original)! As a writer, I found THE SINGING DETECTIVE to be a fine example of how one's life and experiences creep into one's writing no matter what genre you write in. Each and every member of the stellar cast is letter-perfect, with particularly good, sharp chemistry between Downey and, respectively, Robin Wright Penn (I've always loved her name; it's especially appropriate for someone playing a writer's wife :-), and producer Mel Gibson (as Dark's seemingly goofy but astute and compassionate therapist, Gibson is all but unrecognizable in bald drag; Greg Cannom's F/X makeup serves both Gibson and Downey well. In fact, Downey's psoriasis makeup is so good you might not want to watch this while eating!). It's a shame THE SINGING DETECTIVE didn't do better with critics or at the box office, or Downey probably would've been a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination. I could empathize with Downey as the angry, clever, pain-racked (physically and emotionally) Dan Dark even when he wasn't particularly likable. The versatile Downey could be a Bogart for the Aughties if he could keep his own personal demons under control. I also enjoyed seeing our household fave Adrien Brody in a relatively lighthearted (for this film :-) role as one of a pair of Dark's fictional hoods with a bumbling streak. Jon Polito completes the pair; he and Brody are like an amoral Abbott & Costello. Their repartee cracked me up, especially their ""Patti Page"" exchange early in the film (just watching Brody mouthing the barks in ""How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?"" is worth the rental price! :-). Give this new SINGING DETECTIVE a try next time you're in the video store and in the mood for something different. If you rent the DVD and like it, watch it again with Keith Gordon's commentary track on; he has lots of intriguing and entertaining things to say about the making of the film, particularly about the cast and how he and his crew got those great surreal effects on a low budget.",1081468800,,3070,4.905769230769231
1985509,2,B0001AW04I,"Because of the strong list of actors in this movie, ""The Singing Detective"" could have been an absolute gem, but it was simply bogged down by the writing. From start to finish this script seems confused, as though the writer was trying to cram way too many things into one simple film.
This movie is about Dark, a novelist laid up in hospital with a severe skin condition. Here he hallucinates about being a private detective in the 30's or 40's, where the story is even more muddled by strange musical lip-synching that hardly advances the plot.
The acting here is strong, as Robert Downey Jr. is in his usual fine form, going from a film noir detective to a bitter patient in the present day. Katie Holmes and Robin Wright Penn also deliver strong performances as a nurse and Dark's wife, respectively. The true achievement in this film is the performance of Mel Gibson, who plays an eccentric psychotherapist for Dark. He plays the doctor with an impressive quirkiness that I thought was not possible from the usually wooden Gibson.
I think this movie could have really been great, and there are elements here that glimmer with hope, but it all falls flat because of the overbearing script.

It is a thriller/spoof/comedy/tender statement about man's isolation and dependency on illusion to explain the past, and just plain bizarre but thoroughly entertaining stuff!

He is riveting and fascinating as the disturbed and deluded Dan Dark, a man trapped in his own painful skin by memories and a vivid imagination.
But despite Downey's performance, and the fact that Dennis Potter wrote the script, the movie just doesn't have the power and the depth of the TV series. Potter understood the medium of television, and the British psyche at a level unmatched by any other writer of his generation. But for reasons I don't understand. in translating his own work into a form suitable for the big screen and a North American audience too much was lost.

8009419,1,B0001AW04I,"Based on a much-loved British television series, the big screen adaptation of ""The Singing Detective"" demonstrates all that's wrong with Hollywood. First, for a major piece of praise: the cinematography here is absolutely gorgeous. It's a beautifully shot movie, and director Keith Gordon's eye for composition is keen. Similarly, Mel Gibson as Dr. Gibbon gives a fantastic performance, though he's utterly surrounded by scenery chewing from the balance of the cast, particularly Robert Downey, Jr. as pulp fiction author Dan Dark. And that character name as embarrassing as it is symbolizes everything wrong with this film: it's so obviously wanting to pander to film noir (I'm almost surprised it wasn't released in black and white) while embracing fantasy, musicals, drama, and comedy all at the same time. It's always trying to be edgy and clever without actually being edgy or clever, and plays as one big Humphrey Bogart imitation contest.

Others have detailed the plot, so I will go sparingly on the details, but the arc of the story concerns Dark, who at the film's opening is seen barking like a dog and suffering from a horrible skin infection in a hospital. This introduces the medical subcomponent; immediately thereafter the noir gangster subcomponent is introduced with the drowning of a woman in a bathtub. Get used to these rapid fire shifts in time period (much is told in flashback) and storyline; much of this is clearly fantasy, but there is frequent deliberate blurring of fantasy and reality, and if the characters and fundamental storytelling weren't so entirely off-putting it would be effective and interesting. Instead it's merely trying.

Let's recall that the title is ""The Singing Detective"", so the third major film styling is the cast spontaneously and inappropriately breaking into song. The first time we see this is in Dark's hospital room when the hospital staff launch into ""At The Hop"". What? Why? This song has no connection to the plot and just serves to justify the word ""singing"" in the title. This is but the first of many songs from the 1940s and 1950s that will be crooned for no reason except as a manifestation of Dark's descent into madness. The script is not very nuanced, and the filmmakers evidently decided that Downey screaming profanities passes as witty, but it's really just boring after the first few minutes. Here the f-bomb is a lazy crutch. Dark resists the help of Dr. Gibbon, and the scenes of Dark and Gibbon are the best in the film thanks to Gibson. In the major ""duh"" moment of the film, Gibbon concludes that Dark doesn't like women, a point made very obvious by the various relationships he has with women throughout all subplots shown. In one of the psychoanalysis scenes the most self-revelatory line of dialogue in the movie is uttered with unexpected significance: ""If this was a movie, it'd be on the cutting room floor"". Indeed, I don't know why all of this wasn't left there and swept into a bin by the janitor. As a bonus, watch for the world's most grating word free association psychotherapy.

Rarely have I been so perturbed with a movie, and while I'm not against having multiple intertwining storylines per se (in skilled hands it can be a very effective technique, see ""Dunkirk"" for example), there isn't enough interesting material here for its 108-minute running time. Sometimes picking your most interesting story and telling it is a better call (though in fairness, I wouldn't want to have seen any of these). That brings me to the biggest problem with the entire movie: there isn't a single character I care about, and in fact, Dark is so irritating it's hard not to wish ill on him. As the film ends, the plots converge as the hoods come to the hospital for Dark which is actually the only interesting intersection of storylines in the movie, but the glimmer of interest that was sparked is almost as quickly dashed by a terrible breaking of the fourth wall.

That there is some major league talent on display here is indisputable, making it more astonishing that with a great cast and tons of ability behind the camera that something this difficult to sit through was the result. The film was estimated to have cost around $9,000,000 and grossed about $336,000 in its US release. I'm frankly surprised it did that well.

The DVD includes a commentary with director Keith Gordon. I'm normally one to watch a film again to hear a cast or director commentary, even for films I didn't particularly care for. Over the years I have really enjoyed the insights I've gleaned from commentaries, and have even reflected and changed my mind to some degree about a couple of films after seeing them again with the commentary enabled. In this case I made an exception to my rule as there's absolutely no way I am ever going to watch this again. In fact I just want it out of my house.
