8396335,4,B003G4CWWQ,"We ordered this DVD for our daughters because we were so taken by the firefly song performed by Luis (Emilio Delgado) on Sesame Street. From Luis, we learn the Spanish word for firefly and hear a beautiful performance in the process. In addition, kids are exposed to the beneficial aspects of insects.",1394668800,,301,4.8076923076923075

8396338,5,B003G4CWWQ,I bought this for my daughter for xmas last year.  We needed a video for her to watch on her personal dvd player when she started getting crabby during our trips out to dinner.  Every time we turned it on- peace for the adults!  Half the time the volume was turned down/off and she just watched without complaint.  She has been using this video from 16mths and she's 27mths now.  There is one extremely boring segment where Maria and Luis sing and play the guitar.  Snoozer; we always have to skip ahead to the next segment. There is video footage of actual creepy crawlers and they're pretty gross to look at during dinner so we make sure to face the video away from those dining.,1322265600,,681,4.408
