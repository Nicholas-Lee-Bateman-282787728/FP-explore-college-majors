3715711,5,B001NFNFGM,"this is a good video.  some of the formats used by travel channel on the videos is limited on its usability.  I am glad to see this on DVD.  I did look for that when I purchased the DVD.  this show some interesting perspectives on some interesting places.  Sam usualy has a good show and is a good narator.  I like a lot of Travel channel videos, but some are availible only in a format that is limited in its usability.  again I am glad to see the DVD format here.  video on demand does not lend itself to good compatibility on different players  sometimes I fail to understand what the recording industry is thinking in this country.  why not allow recording to DVD and put the royalty tax on the Recording Discs.  that is another can of worms.  this video is very good and provides entertaining video viewing.  again I am glad it is on DVD.",1284163200,2,843,4.292993630573249
3715712,5,B001NFNFGM,Samantha Brown is fabulous and perfect.  She always knows how to make you laugh.  I can not wait for the rest of her stuff to come out on DVD.  I have One iPod already full of her and I had to buy another for music!  She is definitely a must watch! One of the best if not the best host you could ever have on a show.,1270512000,3,316,3.671641791044776
3715713,2,B001NFNFGM,"If you like to see Samantha Brown sample many different foods and drinks, this set of DVDs is for you.  If you like pretty postcard views of cities and sunsets, this is your thing.  If you like to see Samantha Brown in a bikini (several times), you'll enjoy this.  And if you like to see her doing wacky and scary stunts, you're in luck.

But this set can scarcely be considered in depth or even representative of the cities and places she visits.  She likes all the food and drinks--or pretends to for the sake of being polite.  She takes you to mostly pleasant scenes--except on Cape Cod and Austin.  And she does look very nice in a bikini.

Lastly, this is not for diabetics, however.  It's cloying sweet.  It's cute.  Ms. Brown is cute.  Cute women laugh mirthlessly at nothing.  And cute is never a good thing--in movies, books, paintings or people.",1249084800,8,855,4.509803921568627
3715714,5,B001NFNFGM,Samantha does such a great job taking you on her adventures around the world i enjoy watching her as much as the exotic locations that i only wish i could go to you get a tour presented by one of the most charming and pleasant personalities on TV,1244678400,3,246,4.145833333333333
3715715,5,B001NFNFGM,"I love ALL of the Samantha Brown shows, with my most-recent acquisition having been the ""Great Weekends.""  I also have all of the Passport to Europe DVDs, and wish the shows she did on cruise ships, at Disney World, at Great Hotels and Passport to Latin America would also be made available.  I give ""Great Weekends"" my highest recommendation.",1244505600,3,343,4.796610169491525
3715716,4,B001NFNFGM,"Lovely 30-something Sam Brown is the modern day
Lauria McKenzie, travel-maven of the '80's-90's.

This DVD is very good as most all of Sam's from
her various jaunts around the globe in shows like:
Great Hotels, Great Vacations, Europe, Latin America,
Girl Meets Hawai'i, et, al. Highly recommended. From
World Traveler, Revisionist Rich Salzer. Be sure to
check out my other 998 reviews!",1237161600,4,387,5.142857142857143

8326638,4,B001NFNFGM,"I really like to watch Sam Brown and get an idea of the places she visits.  As a travel agent I keep an arsenal of videos of different places to show clients.  These videos are great but the average traveler should just use them to look an area.  Sam gets special priviledges that the regular traveler doesn't get so if you are looking at these to do things in the area, just keep in mind you don't have a camera following you and most of her adventures are set up with that in mind.",1391040000,,483,4.117021276595745
8326639,5,B001NFNFGM,I love Sam Brown. I have every DVD she has ever made. I can't wait to see the Travel Channel release MORE Sam Brown!,1390262400,,116,3.875
8326640,5,B001NFNFGM,"As always, Samantha Brown is one of the funnest travel show hosts to watch.  Her episodes are fun and interesting and she goes places that you do not see on other travel shows.",1389225600,,176,4.333333333333333
8326641,2,B001NFNFGM,"I have a big sense of humor but I can't enjoy her humor this time. this DVD, she has a sense of humor like a 6 year old boy.
Like she said in Austin that she has bats coming out of her butt and she stood in a way that it did look like that! This does not belong in a travel show.
Sure, humor is great, but this was very childish. I'll stick to Rick Steves thank you!",1335571200,2,366,3.6455696202531644
8326642,2,B001NFNFGM,"I love Samantha Brown and I had previously purchased her Passport to Europe DVDs (which are great!).  However, I found this dvd to be pretty boring.  She did a lot of episodes of her basically just going to see friends and a lot of her experiences seemed rushed.  I guess its to be expected since shes trying to visit foreign countries in 2 days.  The US destinations left a lot to be desired.  I fell asleep on this dvd twice!  I get that when she visits places shes trying not to go where most travel shows go and cover but sometimes I think thats unavoidable.  The only episode I really enjoyed was the Paris one.",1328400000,2,616,4.304347826086956
8326643,3,B001NFNFGM,"I bought this DVD without knowing Brown's travel perspective, and I found that it was too feminine for my taste. I expected a combination of both male-female interests in her travels, but everything is shopping and smooth massages. Ok for ladies only.",1287705600,4,251,5.0
