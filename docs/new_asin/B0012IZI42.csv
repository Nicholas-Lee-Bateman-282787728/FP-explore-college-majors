8246186,5,B0012IZI42,"Bibleman is superb, all of them.  The story lines help kids to understand how the devil operates, and how the Word of God, can help them face challenges.  The characters show their own human flaws, and how important it is to call on the Lord in times of trouble. As a kid's church teacher for 16 years, I can say, kids understand, respond to, and LOVE Bibleman movies.  Parents can trust this series, to go by the Bible, they are well done.",1410048000,,440,4.341463414634147
8246187,5,B0012IZI42,My daycare loves this series. It is nice to have a good super hero that explains what he's fighting. Not just fighting the bad guy.,1402272000,,131,4.28

8246189,5,B0012IZI42,"Move over Batman, Spiderman, Wonder Woman and the rest of your buddies. All of the Bibleman movies rock. They are great for boys AND girls who want a superhero they CAN emulate. (Since Bibleman has a few ""helpers"" and 1 or 2 are females) Bibleman is just a regular guy who fights evil with the Word of God - just like everyone should who follows Jesus Christ. They are a little ""goofy"" & spoof other shows which make it fun for the children yet they teach a great message! These have helped my child learn scripture verses easily through the ""fun factor"". And not only do they have movies but toys to play with and costumes to dress up in to playout the movies. Great alternative to regular superhero's.",1274313600,4,703,4.457364341085271
