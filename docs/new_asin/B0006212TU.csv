2158535,5,B0006212TU,"Not to mention Telekhova (my favorite) and Ruzimatov, other soloists are wonderful, too.  Once can detect that these dancers have a common style and technical achievement that must be the product of Kirov training. I hope that the legacy has continued after the end of Soviet.",1242950400,8,276,5.0
2158536,5,B0006212TU,"This is not a very recent performance, but it is certainly one of the finest done in the modern style(no ""chubby"" dancing!).  The video quality is not perfect, showing a little age.  The colors are slightly faded, but the picture is definitely acceptable.  This might qualify as a collector's dvd.  If you want something new and flashy you might want the Paris Opera Ballet version(also first class).  I really enjoyed the dancing in this Kirov performance.  The character dancing is also noteworthy.",1103760000,20,500,5.036585365853658

8036716,1,B0006212TU,"So sad. I was really looking forward to viewing this ballet, but I have to agree, the quality of the video reproduction is awful. It looks like a blurred colorized black and white. On top of that the cameras are much of the time in the furthest tier from the stage. I am so dissappointed. I can't believe someone would market this. Trust me, SAVE YOUR MONEY, no matter how much you love this ballet, I wish I did.",1424131200,,413,4.2405063291139244

8036719,5,B0006212TU,"Although the film quality is not as good as today's BluRay the artistry of the Kirov (now Mariinsky) shines through. This is a terrific version just watching the dancing. I know some will complain about picture quality, but who cares if the dancing is this good?",1393718400,,262,4.717391304347826
8036720,3,B0006212TU,"Why does Amazon mix the comments on two different products? I agree with the one-star comment in that the visual quality is terrible; plus Terekhova who danced Kitri lacked personality, which is rare in Kirov shows. For me the treasure in this dvd is young Altynai Asylmuratova's great performance.",1383004800,,298,5.1020408163265305
8036721,5,B0006212TU,"Fabulous dancers, wonderful voices.  Delightful visual adventure, one can really see that this is a genuine Kirov work
of art.",1363910400,,126,5.3
8036722,5,B0006212TU,"For me, Tatyana Terekhova is the best Kitri I have ever seen.  Somehow her fluid style and vivaciousness brings it home for me better than any other ballerina, even highly accomplished ones.  This video does indeed seem quite dated, which it is.  However, rather than that take away from it's beauty, the romantic scenery and costumes have a delightful, timeless charm.  Highly recommended version of one of the most beloved ballets of all time. The Kirov is wonderful.",1338076800,,469,4.9743589743589745
8036723,5,B0006212TU,"This dvd has some spectacular dancing in it, though I found Ruzimatov lacking the kind of sizzle I had expected based on his dvd of Scheherazade.  Terekhova is a wonderful dancer and it shows in everything she does here.  This is a big corps ballet and they aree every bit as wonderful as you would expect the Kirov to be.  If you are unfamiliar with the score be ready for the lightest of saccharine fluff.  It is so lightweight that I find it hard to believe anyone could get an orchestra to take it seriously enough to rehearse.",1279843200,2,531,4.387755102040816
