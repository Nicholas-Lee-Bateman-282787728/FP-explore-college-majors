4587669,1,B0056ANHN6,"This is a long, tediously comprehensive film about the terrorist career of Carlos. It comes in at way over five hours. To its credit, its more watchable the ""Che"" was as a long-form work. But it shares most of Che's other faults. Being better than ""Che"" is worth something, but its not really praise.

Carlos is another Marxist robotic terminator uberman like Che. We drop into his story with little background on the making of the man. The early parts of his life, his family life, his time in Moscow and his early days in the middle east....would have actually been far more interesting that much of what was dramatized on film. It would have also made Carlos slightly more human. But I don't think making him more human was among the objectives of the film makers. It would have seemed like covering his early years would have been possible in 5+ hours of film. Likewise, we never really see the aftermath with him in prison.

The film's greatest flaw its that it endlessly repeats itself. Its less like a film and more like a giant collection of dramatized stock footage covering every possible moment of significance in the terrorist career of Carlos. We get stock scenes of (political meetings, hanging around apartments, meeting germans, using women) over-and-over-and-over again. The names change, the background change, the words change but the scenes are essentially the same.

The high point of the film is the material covering the OPEC incident. As action and drama, its well done. The acting is excellent too. But its only a small part of the whole. And the rest is not so good.

The film, despite its length, is also structurally good. It covers the rise of Carlos up to the OPEC incident, shows him peaking there, and then shows his steady decline into irrelivance. Its too long and its repetitive, but they did a good job of making it work after a fashion. The craft of those involved overcame some of the limitations of the format and the material.

There are some historical problems with the script. There is too much name-dropping of certain well-known characters for effect: (Saddam Hussein, Khadaffi). They put Saddam in charge of Iraq several years before it really happened. They take too many wild theories by intelligence agencies as if they were absolute facts. And they take things like the plot of Carlos to go after Sadat way too seriously. There are also some strange notions about who was leading the PFLP in the 1970s.

There are also some curious omissions. Such as the non-mention of the nickname ""Jackal"" in the film. And I don't know how easy it will be for those not familiar with the history of the era to follow. The film assumes a considerable about of knowledge.

Its not a good film. And quite honestly the life of the main character is not worth spending five plus hours covering. But if nothing else, its better and more watchable than ""Che"".",1317340800,17,2888,4.729622266401591
4587670,5,B0056ANHN6,"This is one of the best mini-series I've ever seen.  Fast paced, great, scene-stealling acting, incredible drama-action scenes. Completely worth anyone's time who liked ""Munich"", ""Syriana"", ""The Wire"" or ""Generation Kill"".  5 Stars!",1311638400,3,232,6.0
4587671,5,B0056ANHN6,"This is a brilliant miniseries. Be sure to get the miniseries and not the film version. Carlos is portrayed as a totally egocentric character and not at all likeable. But it is a fascinating study of a kind of person drawn to terrorism for excitement. Despite being very long, the miniseries doesn't really drag. On just a few occasion it gets a bit slow, but the director has scouted for nice locations with a 70s feel so even those sections are interesting. Highly recommended. Clearly in  my top 5 for 2010.",1311292800,8,510,4.604395604395604
4587672,5,B0056ANHN6,"Fascinating 5 hour plus, 3 part film about Carlos the Jackal (although he never called himself that) the headline grabbing terrorist of the 70s and 80s.  Never stopping for exposition, or to explain how Carlos got to be is who he is, were dropped into a whirlwind of violence, self-aggrandizement, sexual seduction, and power games -- all moving at an almost dizzying speed.  The film allows us to slowly figure out Carlos for ourselves, instead of explaining him in a simple or facile way.

While never sympathetic, somehow the amazing Edgar Rameriez allows us to feel for this id and ego driven creature, who would never admit it even to himself, but who was powered far more by the need for attention and adulation (whether with women or terrorism) than by true belief.

The film only grew in stature for me on a second viewing, which cemented its intelligence and unique perspective in managing to keep us caught up not only in Carols, but in the angry, violent, crazy, desperate and lost people around him, and to keep them all human enough to stay absorbed by, without forgiving their grievous sins.  A beautiful walking of the tightrope of empathy but not sympathy.

The last 1/3 is the most challenging section.  Carloss slow decline into ineffectiveness and unimportance is slower, and less viscerally exciting.  But this seems unavoidable after the high paced rush of the first two parts and also seems part of the point of the film,  Without his fixes of women and power there wasn't really much to Carlos and with those gone both he - and eventually we - want it to be over.

This is a challenging, brilliantly acted, wonderfully made film, that gives context both to modern terrorism and recent world history. along with intelligently exploring the fine line between power and uncontrolled narcissism that seems to dog (especially male) charismatic leaders of all stripes, types and political persuasions from Hitler to Bill Clinton to Carlos.  Thats a lot to cover successfully, even in 5 hours.",1308614400,48,2009,4.879411764705883

4587684,5,B0056ANHN6,"First shown on French television, Carlos, the full version presented by Criterion, was ineligible for Oscar nomination, though I thought it had the best leading actor performance (the amazing Edgar Ramirez) (you really want to compare Oscar winner Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart to Ramirez's tour de force???) and arguably best picture of 2010.  It demands knowledge or research of the political events and nuances but the performances and cinematography are so strong as to render detailed knowledge unnecessary.  An unsympathetic character, a terrorist monster,  with maddeningly complex and nearly attractive characteristics, Ramirez achieves a dramatic arc over the 339 minutes (and it seems so much shorter than its running time) that is one of the most memorable in film history.  The actor took on a part that is dangerous and constantly evolving and has succeeded on every level of great performance art.  The movie presents issues that viewers are forced to argue over, accept, reject, reconsider, smile, frown, and respond to on multiple emotional levels.  The action sequences are marvelous for tension and character input, the center piece being the OPEC takeover in part two.  Some have expressed a bit of disappointment over the slower pace of part three, certainly compared to the first four hours, but we are dealing with yet another phase in the protagonists existence, one which adheres to his changing world and physical deterioration.  This is one hell of a movie and demands repeated viewings to appreciate and absorb its artistry.",1360540800,3,1549,5.2682926829268295

4587688,3,B0056ANHN6,"I had come to watch this movie with a great sense of anticipation.  For one, Carlos had been a figure legends are wrapped round, for the other, the initial reviews were all 5-star.

In pure cinematographic terms, this is an OK movie--its shortcomings have been already documented in other reviews on Amazon.  Spanning a relatively long arc in the life of a man, whose details seem to be under confidentiality clauses for decade(s) to come, takes this movie much farther from the documentary form than most seem to acknowledge.  In pure artistic terms, this movie fails in its lack of (narrative) structure.  Worth mentioning is the cinematography, which gets the viewer in the period/midst of the action.  The actors perform well, by and large realistically.

If we turn to the documentary quality of ""Carlos,"" things are much worse.  The lens floats on the surface of few interactions, by far insufficient to reveal/suggest the depth of USSR involvement--Hungary, GDR and Syria had been the closest allies of the Red Empire.  We get the idea that Carlos was a man of several vices (womanizer, drinker, argyrophilic, etc.), who developed a big ego and thrived among dubious friends and vulnerable democracies.  More importantly, still unanswered is how it was possible for Carlos to go in and out of so many places, with resources and logistics, in situations that would defeat even the holy/luckiest.  The maker(s) of the film doesn't even care to speculate...  To add insult to the injury, I find the referrals to the support Carlos got from some Arab states a bit more than suspect in their resonating with a semi-official list of enemies of the West from the past 11 years.

All in all, however watchable, this movie is less than art and much less than documentary.",1338422400,2,1769,4.915824915824916

The French New Wave inspired free-flowing filmmaking technique that Olivier Assayas used on a smaller scale in earlier films such as Irma Vepp is taken to a macro level and extended onto an epic canvas.  Carlos is nothing more than a history of modern terrorism, told through the story of a man who started out as an idealist, then became nothing more than a parody of himself.  Power indeed does corrupt, but its a great subject matter for movies.",1321228800,3,646,4.4576271186440675
4587694,4,B0056ANHN6,"""Carlos"" is a must to have for any political radical- as a leftist,  non-violent one myself, the film does nothing to change my thoughts that terrorism is a bad tactic- whether state terrorism of a Bush or the Arab terrorism of a Carlos or al Queda. When Boston police bash the veterans who are trying to protect the camp of the occupiers- it is the state that looks bad- not the saintly protestors. Surely the actions of a Carlos pale beside the terrorism of a Quaddafi or an Obama with his drones; they both look laughable in terms of changing the world, building socialism, protecting the peace, or gaining adherents.

Carlos and his German cronies, allegedly communists or leftists, never discuss the plight of the workers, they become fighters for Palestine with never a mention of class struggle, capitalism, of the necessary task of organizing workers- does one see any workers in their groups? To become wards of the state of Syria, or Sudan? disgraceful- it almost makes one want to side with the state.
How does blowing up a speeding train help the cause? It is completely counter productive.

Che at lease, was an internationalist, hoping for the support of Bolivian peasants. These guys and gals are romantic anarchists, like little boys blowing up frogs in the nearby stream- juvenile and absurd. One wonders were they actually agents of the state? or just advertisers for the international arms trade?

However, the two best aspects about this lengthy docudrama are the consistency of an intriguingly told story and, most importantly, Edgar Ramirez' incredible performance! Watch this one, take a few days to do it, but watch it. For further great movies in the same vein, I recommend Mesrine (Parts 1 & 2) & Che (both parts & featuring an incredible performance by Benecio del Toro).",1320364800,3,616,4.558558558558558

4587697,4,B0056ANHN6,"This is a fascinating and extremely exciting film, one of the all time greats in my view. Edgar Ramirez does a remarkable job as Carlos. The casting is generally excellent with a huge variety of different linguistic and ethnic parts played with an astonishing degree of accuracy, even their English accents, when they speak English, matches reality. The one fault, and it is a huge and quite unnecessary fault, is the decision to only subtitle when English is not spoken. There is hardly a native English part anywhere and most English accents are very thick and hard to understand even for those that may be familiar with such accents. For those that have little experience in this field, large parts of the English dialoge, (which I estimate to be about a third of the total), are extremely hard to follow. An infuriating failure! I have marked down the final rating purely because of this serious shortcoming. Criterion told me this release would have full English subtitles. This is sadly not so. In addition the subtitles they do have are all inside the picture frame. The Optimum region B release has sharper subtitles that are outside the frame and consequently more readable when single line. The Optimum is a little lighter with the colour and I found it better. Where the Criterion scores is with the extras that are really excellent and this release is worth buying for these alone. However Criterion again exhibit their characteristic defect by making little effort to make their subtitles readable and for much of the extras it is hard going. I am at a loss to understand Criterion in this respect. They do wonderful picture transfers, good sound and usually a really interesting range of extras BUT their subtitles are more often than not sub-standard, especially in the extras. Seven Samurai is another example where their release is severely compromised by incompetent subtitle managment. This release does not have the short version of the film as given by Optimum but having watched both I feel this is not much of a loss. For the film the Optimum transfer is slightly better but despite sloppy attention to subtitling this Criterion has by far the best extras. If you can play A & B get both! Watch the film on the Optimum and the extras, which are as good as the film, on the Criterion. If only Criterion would look at their products from the customers point of view and sharpen up their internal quality control!",1319846400,4,2433,4.809069212410501
4587698,3,B0056ANHN6,"This intense, textured epic from director Olivier Assayas about the swaggering global terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal hooked me.  Here's the epic French TV production surprising in its detail and biographical arc, had me rooting for, then gradually pitying and then fearing Carlos as portrayed by Edgar Ramirez.  Thankfully unedited for its home video release, the five and a half hour running time goes by with a surprisingly bracing swiftness.

Carlos, real name Ilich Ramrez Snchez, was a Venezuelan who plotted assassinations, abductions and bombings throughout Europe and the Middle East. This Golden Globe-winning biopic tracks Carlos from 1973 to 1994 during the time he and his cohorts wreaked havoc in Paris, stormed OPEC's Vienna headquarters and carried out other devastating acts of political violence.

Ample extras include new interviews with star and director as well as archival conversations with Carlos.  Additional print material provides critical essays, a timeline and bios of key characters.",1319068800,2,1018,5.541935483870968
4587699,4,B0056ANHN6,"The following review is for the THEATRICAL VERSION only:

So, last year's `Carlos' was one of those films I didn't really know how to take; and that was before I even saw the film.  It was being nominated (and at times even winning) in various categories in film and television and I always look at film through a specific light (in terms of awards) so I was struggling with understanding just what this film was.  Was it a television mini-series?  Was it a feature film?  It can't be both; can it?

It is both, and since I never `really' watch TV, and I always watch films with the intent of categorizing my own personal awards, I watched the theatrical cut.

I need to see the full version ASAP!

That isn't to say that this theatrical version isn't good, because it is very good.  I just have a feeling that this could have been great, and I feel that it probably is in its full five-plus hour form.  I have always been one for lengthy, in depth portrayals of real life individuals, because life is never a condensing of particular events.  You cannot begin to fathom who someone really is by merely focusing on the moments in their life that are the most eventful or the most memorable or the most publicized.  It is the smaller moments (some of which are hinted at in this cut) that really `make the man' so-to-speak.  With that in mind, this nearly three hour expose on Carlos the Jackal misses the mark a bit for me.  There is so much time spent on a few `events' that little time is given to his personal life, other than some colorful (and rather explicit) moments involving his indulgences.  My main complaint is the film's conclusion.  The last thirty minutes or so feel rushed and contain riffs, spotty developmental points that could have (and possibly are) been fleshed out fuller to provide a more well-rounded idea of who this man was.

That mere complain aside, this film is still VERY good and I highly recommend seeing it.  I am the type of person (and this is a personal thing) that struggles following certain biopics it they aren't familiar territory for me.  I've heard of Carlos the Jackal, but my understanding of his life and times are really derived from this film, as I was not familiar with him beforehand.  Because of that, some of the events conveyed went over my head without further research on the subject, and while contemplating the events certainly fleshed them out in my mind as the film progressed, I had to constantly think about it in order to appreciate it.

Another reason why I should see the full version soon.

For what this is (a condensed `edit' of a much larger epic portrayal of a legendary terrorist) it is very good.  The direction is sharp and the scenes have a flow to them.  You really wouldn't guess that there was any edit at all here, which is surprising.  As much as I missed some `smaller details' about this man, I didn't feel that there exclusion damaged the internal flow of the film.  The pacing was superb (even at nearly three hours it flew by) and the performances are all uniformly great, with Edgar Ramirez serving up one of the finest performances I've seen in a long time.  He's sexy and vibrant and cool and stern and commanding and alluring and arrogant and charming, all when needed and never confusing.  It's a powerhouse performance; truly.  The other actors come and go, some leaving an imprint (Nora von Waldstatten is particularly good in her few scenes, but it is also her storyline that suffers the most from the condensing taking place) while others don't add much.

In the end, I highly recommend seeing this film.  I will soon (not sure when, but soon) get around to seeing the full television version, and after that I'll be able to weigh in more fully on my feelings, but for now they are good.  I truly like the spirit that was captured here.  I won't soon forget this film.",1318464000,,3861,4.541244573082489
4587700,4,B0056ANHN6,"""Carlos"" is an ambitious project undertaken by director Olivier Assayas, who also co-wrote the film for French television, that spans about 20 years in the life of Ilich Ramrez Snchez, otherwise known as ""Carlos"", the infamous leftist terrorist from Venezuela who made a name for himself in the 1970s by leading a raid on an OPEC conference in Vienna in which several delegates were killed. The film ran about 5 1/2 hours on French TV, but Assayas shot this as if for the big screen, in widescreen on 35mm film. It has a sweep and a beauty, thanks in part to cinematographers Yorick Le Saux and Denis Lenoir, not associated with television. The lighting is beautiful. I love the way ""Carlos"" looks.

The film follows Carlos' life in England, France, Germany, Hungary, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Sudan from 1973 to 1994, when he was captured by a French intelligence operation in Khartoum. He's currently serving a life sentence in a French prison for the 1975 murders of 2 DST agents. Carlos wanted to join an armed struggle against what he saw as capitalist imperialist powers determined to disenfranchise or oppress the masses. He didn't think that toppling the odd dictator in South America accomplished very much. He wanted an internationalist revolution against the Western powers that be. That did bring him fame, but, predictably, he was manipulated more than he was manipulator.

In a way, it seems inappropriate to dedicate so much of the screen to a man whose celebrity was created by a press looking for an obvious villain with whom to tar the law-abiding leftist activists in Europe. A narcissist who was more than happy to believe his own press, Carlos fit the bill perfectly. But Carlos was a character who could not have existed in any other time. He claimed to represent the ""Armed Wing of the Arab Revolution"". He worked for Wadie Haddad of the PFLP for a while, who in turn worked for the KGB, after Haddad had broken with George Habash and, disastrously, decided to take the fight for Palestine to Europe. Later, Carlos became outright mercenary.

Carlos was able to get away with so much, because he found protection in Yemen, Eastern Europe, and East Germany during the Cold War. He was useful to the Soviets and tolerated by the Eastern Bloc. Once the Cold War ended, he was not even safe in Sudan. Before the OPEC raid in 1975, Carlos needed the support of militant groups or anti-Western governments to provide him with arms and training, but he had some control over his destiny. After the OPEC raid, he could only find refuge by outright selling his services to governments friendly with the Soviet Bloc. He could only react to his circumstances and wheel and deal to survive; he could not longer be proactive.

""Carlos"" aired in 3 parts, which Criterion has put on 3 separate discs. The first part covers the events leading to the shootout on rue Toullier in Paris, which killed the 2 DST agents. The second part covers the OPEC raid and its aftermath. The third part spans the years 1979-1994, when Carlos and his group, consisting of German Johannes Weinrich (Alexander Scheer), Syrian Kamal al-Issawi (Talal el-Jurdi), and Carlos' wife Magdalena Kopp (Nora Von Waldstatten), were always looking for a country to shelter them and jobs that would pay well. The first part feels longer than it is. The second part is well-paced. I felt the third part contained too much extraneous material.

So the pacing is uneven. ""Carlos"" is part character study, part action movie, part political history. Venezuelan actor dgar Ramrez was a godsend. He effectively projects Carlos' energy that is at the same time charismatic, destructive, and self-destructive. He embodies Carlos' narcissism, his darkness, and his lust for life. And Ramrez, son of a diplomat, speaks Spanish, English, French, German, and Italian. Carlos was similarly gifted with languages and spoke fluent Arabic as well. Ramrez has done the Arabic phonetically. The film is in English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic, with a little Russian and Hungarian. Subtitles are in English.

Ilich Ramrez Snchez has challenged the accuracy of the film, in particular of the guns blazing during the OPEC raid. I wondered about that myself. Did these people really waste bullets and make as much noise as possible? Some conversations that took place in Europe are realistic, because they were recorded by intelligence services at the time. But I wonder what Wadie Haddad actually said about Carlos, or if he is being made to articulate the writers' observations. ""Carlos"" is an accomplishment, but there are some pacing problems in the first part, editing problems in the third, and I wish it said more about Carlos' image in the press and been more explicit about the powers that used him.

The DVDs (Criterion Collection 2011 4-disc set): The film is in 3 parts on discs 1-3. Disc 4 is bonus features, and there are some bonus features on discs 2 & 3 as well. Bonus features on Disc 2 are: ""Shooting the OPEC Sequence"" (20 min), which takes us behind the scenes and offers some commentary by director Olivier Assayas (in English & French with English subtitles), and ""Denis Lenoir"" (13 min), which is an interview with one of the film's cinematographers. Lenoir talks about shooting the film quickly, lighting, and working with director (in English). There is also a ""Selected Scene Commentary"" (9 min) by Denis Lenoir in which he describes how he shot 6 scenes.

The bonus features on Disc 3 are interviews with Olivier Assayas (43 min) and with actor dgar Ramrez (20 min). The interview with Assayas, filmed April 2011, is very worthwhile. He speaks about Carlos' media image and place in Cold War politics, as well as how the project came together. Ramrez offers his observations of Carlos' character and tells us how he prepared for the role. These interviews are in English.

Disc 4 contains two documentaries and one interview. ""Carlos: Terrorist without Borders"" (1 hour) is a 1997 French television documentary that follows Carlos' life from his youth until 1994. All of his major activity is covered, and it fills in some gaps in the feature film, so this is worthwhile (in French with English subtitles). ""Hans-Joachim Klein"" (40 min) excerpts a 1995 interview with the man who left Carlos' group, made while he was still in hiding. His discussion of his political life, decisions, and Carlos is articulate and interesting (in German with English subtitles). ""Maison de France"" (1 hr, 28 min) is a documentary about the 1983 bombing of the French consulate in West Berlin by Johannes Weinrich. It focuses on 2 people: the single fatality, a man named Michael Haritz who was at the consulate to deliver an anti-nuclear petition, and the perpetrator, Weinrich. In German with English subtitles.",1318032000,6,6776,4.921259842519685
4587701,2,B0056ANHN6,"I had hopes that this would be an interesting and detailed look at '70s political violence, but I was surprised at the relative superficiality and repetitiveness of the film. Was the political content minimized to avoid offense to someone? (Johnnie Walker and Hertz make repeated appearances.) It's hard to see any motivation for Carlos's actions, beyond machismo, and the lackluster screenwriting makes for a protracted viewing experience, to be sure. ""The Baader Meinhof Complex"" was much more successful at compressing complex historical events; and better yet, one could watch a real film like Costa-Gavras's ""Z.""  This one just seems like it was made on auto-pilot.",1317686400,6,670,5.380952380952381
4587702,5,B0056ANHN6,"Carlos is a towering achievement, a fascinating study of a man who was a reflection of the times in which he lived in and is embodied by Edgar Ramirez's powerful performance spanning several decades.

The first disc includes a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with ""Shooting the OPEC Sequence,"" a 22-minute featurette examining how Olivier Assayas shot Carlos and his team's raid on the OPEC headquarters on December 21, 1975. The director offers his thoughts on what he hoped to achieve with the film over the footage of the cast and crew working on location. This extra provides some insight into his working methods.

There is an interview with Denis Lenoir, one of the film's two cinematographers. He shot the second half of Carlos and talks about his approach towards the job. He didn't prepare much for the film because he came in halfway through and goes into some of the technical aspects (i.e. film stock, lighting, etc.). Lenoir also talks about how Assayas works.

Lenoir also provides a selected-scene commentary, going into detail about the technical aspects of six scenes from the film. For example, he mentions the kinds of lenses he used, the lighting scheme and whether he used hand-held cameras or not.

The third disc features a 43-minute interview with director Olivier Assayas. He gives his take on Carlos and the times that shaped the man. The filmmaker talks about his intentions for the film. He admits that it did not originate with him because he would've considered to complicated a task to undertake and was actually approached to direct. Assayas talks about growing up during Carlos' heyday and also about making the film itself.

There is also a 20-minute interview with actor Edgar Ramirez. He was drawn to the film because it dealt with the mechanics of terrorism and politics. The actor speaks eloquently about his take on Carlos and how the OPEC raid defined him. Ramirez talks about how he prepared for the role, including all kinds of research as well as gaining and then losing weight for the various periods of Carlos' life.

The fourth and last disc starts off with ""Carlos: Terrorist without Borders,"" an hour-long documentary that aired on French television in 1997. It fleshes out many of the events depicted in the film and provides some background into Carlos' politics as well as his rise in prominence. The doc mixes compelling news footage (including actual footage of Carlos) with talking head soundbites to paint a fascinating portrait of the man.

Also included is a 1995 interview with Hans-Joachim Klein, the German left-wing militant that was conducted by Daniel Laconte who went on to help produce Carlos. Most interesting, Klein wears a disguise and talks about how he must lie on a daily basis lest he be discovered by those who want to get him. At times, he comes across as more than a little eccentric.

Finally, there is ""Maison de France,"" an 88-minute documentary about the 1983 bombing of the Maison de France in West Berlin that was orchestrated by Johannes Weinrich for Carlos. It puts the incident in context with the political climate at the time. There is pretty gripping news footage of the bombing and the location is revisited in recent years to see how it has changed.",1317513600,10,3254,4.891107078039927

8459336,3,B0056ANHN6,"hello,
  this movie was ok in the suspense part mainly because we had already lived through many carlos movies.  the real movie clips from the era were familiar as it was front page news.  the disclaimer at the beginning held true.  history always had characters like this and it is very unfortunate that people are in some sort of conflict.  will it ever be solved or put to rest?  probably not as long as different ideology persists, there will be conflict. the movie was ok, not excellent.",1479081600,,492,4.586206896551724
8459337,5,B0056ANHN6,"Fascinating film in every aspect. While it takes a good full day of several to complete its a 'miniseries' I could have kept on watching.
I decided to watch it again after witnessing what turbulence Palestine / Israel citizens & refugees experience on a daily basis. RIP",1470960000,,270,4.76595744680851
8459338,5,B0056ANHN6,"This is very subjective, but I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  The acting is superb, the story captivating, the photography very nice and somewhat yellow and the epic length of this production enjoyable.  I am a fan of the director's other movies (Olivier Assayas), also.  This package came with a bunch of extras.  Note:  As stated in the movie, this is loosely based on The Jackal, but it not intended to be a documentary and plenty of creative license was used.",1470614400,,480,4.534883720930233
