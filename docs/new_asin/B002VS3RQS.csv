8382512,5,B002VS3RQS,This clipper cutting dvd was awesome in teaching the techniques it really deserves a 9 star. It would have been even better if it demonstrated how to set up your cutting station and list the exact names of each tools/model number he is using. He does tell you how to drape your client.  Other then that better than the other videos I have seen. It even teaches you how to cut a beard. I highly recommend this dvd ; ) hopefully dvd vol. 1 will have the other info. I listed that is missing in vol. 2. Ordering vol 1 since vol 2 was awesome,1466294400,,538,4.123809523809523
8382513,5,B002VS3RQS,"As a professional stylist this DVD is basic but to the point and discusses points such as advanced clipper cutting techniques, advanced hair cutting and techniques, barber training, clipper techniques etc. This is a great DVD for those that are in training, as a refresher for experienced stylists or even those that want to learn from home. Very pleased. Many thanks",1419120000,,367,5.032786885245901
8382514,5,B002VS3RQS,"Awesome DVD featuring the celebrity hair stylist Mr. Charles who has worked with the likes of hollywood stars Brian McKnight, Johnny Gill, Jason Weaver and many more! I've found this DVD to be such a great resource for self-learning and training the stylists in our salon. Everything you need to know about all the different types of cuts including the buzz, fade cut, flat top cut, afro cut and the rest. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed.",1415491200,,450,4.857142857142857
8382515,5,B002VS3RQS,"Wow I found this video very helpful in clipper cutting techniques for black men, it is easy to understand and the video demonstrations by Charles were great! I feel that my students will be able to cut more confidently now and they were very impressed with Charles's career highlights. I especially enjoyed the section in which he demonstrates the correct wrist movements. Overall, I am happy with the product and would recommend it to other hairdresser instructors like me.",1411948800,,474,5.012658227848101

8382517,4,B002VS3RQS,"I have both of these clipper cutting volumes and i have to say they are both very similar. The explination is ok he walks you thru what he is doing very well but, leaves somethings unexplained like what is open and what is close,(i mean actually hold the machine to the camera) I gave this product four stars because of the well done haircuts and the thourough walk thru. buy the first volume before even purchaseing the 2nd see what you think.",1303171200,2,444,4.426829268292683
8382518,3,B002VS3RQS,"I purchased this dvd to learn how to cut hair. Overall this guy gets the point across, but i seriously doubt he is a celebrity barber. Looking at the cuts, i feel like i can do better. The best cut throughout the entire dvd is the one on the cover. I purchased volume two, but when you read the description on volume one they seem very identical. Once you pop the dvd in the player they say what happen in volume one, i honestly don't think this is worth $50. This product is over priced.",1296777600,3,488,4.147368421052631
