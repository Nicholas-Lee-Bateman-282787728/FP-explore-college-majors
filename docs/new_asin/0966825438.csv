The craft is poor and the language is geared towards very early elementary aged children. I should have taken the time to read the editorial review that lists the description of the content. I was looking for an informative DVD geared toward middle school students, and the content and length of this video was not worth the $29.95. There is much more involved in printmaking techniques and even basic history of the art form that students would would enjoy and benefit from.",1253232000,3,569,4.7

If you're just beginning to learn how to solder, or need to brush up on your technique, this is a great one to keep in your library.",1237852800,,376,4.295774647887324
