6929242,5,B00RE5Z0UE,sorry my mistake I have the right package 2 disc.thank you very much.,1423612800,,69,4.384615384615385
6929243,4,B00RE5Z0UE,"After watching this a second time, I deleted a previous review because I felt I'd been unfair.  The movie wasn't the best showcase for Shahrukh's talents that I've seen & the scene with all the guys in tutus was just plain asinine.  The first half fell back on too many cheap and crude jokes for my taste, but the second half was better. The special effects throughout were interesting.  They did a good job of integrating the CGI with the live shots on the hotel rooftop in Dubai. I wasn't wild about the music the first time around, but it grows on you.  So while this will never be my favorite, I'll probably watch it every now & then.

I stand by my original point of view about the ringtone ads-  the songs are part of the story and the ads across the top of each song are an annoying distraction.  No they don't stay up long & yes they're small, but they're also pretty bright.  They really bug me.  I think if they've got to have ads they should put them on the song portion of the menu & not in the movie itself.

I can't review the second disc, as I haven't watched it.  Unlike another viewer, I had no issue with the positioning of subtitles- they showed up where they were supposed to be.  The box is surprisingly sturdy & looks like it would contain more than just the 2 discs.  The brochure was just ok. If they'd left it out, I wouldn't have missed it.",1423440000,6,1366,4.227799227799228
6929244,2,B00RE5Z0UE,"This is a review of the Special Edition DVD not the movie itself because I figure you would not be here unless you already liked Happy New Year or SRK.

In a package the size of a boxed set of DVDs you get two disks, a glossy little pamphlet of no value and lots of empty space.

Disk 1 - Movie
  T-Series annoyingly flashes adds for ring tones and the like across the top of the screen every time music plays.  Should you or friends need subtitles they are available only in English and located so far below the movie you will probably have to play with positioning to see them.  Unlike Farah Khans two previous movies she does not do a directors commentary for Happy New Year, which is very disappointing as they were quite entertaining and informative.

Disk 2  Extras
  You get lots of promotions for other T-Series products.
  The deleted scenes are not bad but were deleted for good reason.  The alternate opening is particularly bad.  No commentary to explain why the scenes were dropped.
  The Making of is one of the worst I have seen.  How can the star and producer not be included, but SRK is not one of the talking heads.  Neither is Deepika Padukone or Abhishek Bachchan.  Instead you get lots of Sonu Soud and babbling from nobody co-producers.
  And that is it!  There are no outtakes, no making of the songs, nothing on the special effects or big fight scenes, not even anything on the loads of movie promotions and big opening.",1423353600,18,1444,4.473076923076923

6929246,1,B00RE5Z0UE,"I am a fan of SRK and really enjoyed the performance of the characters he played in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and Chake De! India. It seems like once he got famous, he, the directors, producers and the writers thought they could put out anything without trying too hard, and the audience would gobble it up. At least with this movie, I thought so. I tried two times to watch this on Netflix, but it was so boring and ridiculous, I gave up. I thought at first it was supposed to be a comedy. But the part that SRK was playing was serious and going down a serious path. What was the purpose of the movie? It didn't seem like it was to tell a story, but an excuse for one actor to show off his body and the other famous actor just to be there for his fans to have something to look at. I don't know if the video is the same as Netflix, but the subtitles went by so fast, that it was hard to watch this version of the movie. If I finally get through it and change my opinion, I'll change my review. At this point, I'm really glad I didn't pay money for this.",1487721600,,1048,3.971563981042654

6929273,5,B00RE5Z0UE,"My reasons for liking this movie so much is all of the wonderful colors, the great music & fun dances, the fancy costumes, and all the great stars making it even more brilliant and exciting. It has a serious theme, but it is not a movie you want to go into with a serious mind. It is wildly goofy but deliciously entertaining. Director Farah Khan really took the STARS far out of their more down to earth method of acting which, even though the story was all about a heist of precious jewels from a seemingly impenetrable vault, it made up a film that the whole family can enjoy. Personally, despite the fact that the film is rather long, there was so much more that could have been put into it that would have made it more outstanding. None the less, seeing how well these Top-of-The-Line more serious actors (who've portrayed deadly, incredibly cunning criminal-type characters in other movies) manage to portray these bumbling, yet ingeniously crafty, lovable, and deliciously funny thieves gave me a wider perspective of the awesome world of acting. You may have to watch it more than once to get accustomed to way the characters are, but I'm sure there is something in it for everybody to enjoy.",1432598400,5,1200,4.665094339622642
6929274,5,B00RE5Z0UE,"Happy New Year is a just a fan Bollywood 'marsala' film.  It's got a bit of everything, martial arts, a heist, a love story, slapstick, and of course some incredible song and dance numbers.

The story, such as it is, is that Sharukh Khan assembles a mismatched band of jewel thieves to get revenge on the man who betrayed his father.  The catch?  They can only get to vault by entering the 'World Dance Competition', which provides all the justification needed for several over-the-top numbers including a dance-off between Team India and North Korea.

Don't expect anything deep, or anything all too logical, but it's a fun film with some great songs, and is definitely worth watching.",1432598400,3,686,4.829059829059829

Abhishek Bachchan isand I say this with great affectiona total idiot. I personally find him, more than other, more feted ""funnymen"", the funniest man in Bollywood.

But as a whole, the movie lags in overdone bits (Sonu Sood's ""Hulking out"" alley fight stands foremost), overlong exposition, and not-quite-sharp enough character moments. The songs are near top-flight, but not quite. For me at least, HNY might be worth a 2nd, (even a 3d sometime far away) viewing, but it lags several steps in fun and memorability behind Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om.",1431388800,,730,4.983606557377049

6929282,2,B00RE5Z0UE,"Ah. . . Shahrukh. . .  He is one of my favorites, but this film is not one I would want to watch more than once. His six? eight? pack does not make up for the hoarse voice that makes you want to jump up and hand him a throat lozenge before he speaks another line of dialogue.. Farah Khan has a tendency to beat a joke/sight gag until there is not a drop of life left in it.  Terry's ""bag of surprises,"" Nandu's numerous explosions of vomit, and Jag's hearing problem that seems to remedy itself during a quiet chat on the balcony are just a few examples of elements that detract from the movie.  However, in spite of the poor writing and direction, the ensemble cast does its best to keep the audience in its seats till the bitter end.  The movie never seems to know what it wants to be.  It's not a love story.  It's not really a dance movie, and it certainly is not a well crafted heist movie.",1430697600,,895,4.114942528735632

6929286,4,B00RE5Z0UE,"SPOILER ALERT - This review gives away some things you may not want to know in advance.

I have mixed feelings about Happy New Year. Having seen a SLAM! tour performance, I was expecting great things but found myself somewhat disappointed by the film. Although it's enjoyable to watch, with some truly great performances (especially Abhishek Bachchan as the vomiting, snake dancing alcoholic), the lack of logic gets annoying at times.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't mind silly, like when steams shoots out of Sonu Sood's ear or when Shah Rukh Khan's shirt bursts into flame. That's fun. It's when the world-class international security firm announces where it will be keeping priceless diamonds several months in advance - why? so somebody can put together a complex plan to steal them?  And why are dancers rehearsing on top of a building that anyone can fall off of?  And why didn't Charlie's crew just get into the safe from the top in the first place? I was also disappointed with the dancing. Maybe I'm spoiled by Farah Khan's prior directorial work, but even when she isn't wearing her choreographer hat, it seems as if the overall quality of the dancing (at least by the characters who are supposed to be able to dance) should be better. The only high-quality dance number was Lovely, in which Deepika Padukone was excellent. I do appreciate Farah Khan's presentation of males as sex objects, much as women are presented in most films.  The mud-wrestling (actually, mud kick-boxing) scene in the beginning showcased Shah Rukh Khan's abs, and Sonu Sood's frequently bare torso was impressive. [BTW, Sonu Sood gave a sensitive performance in the balcony scene with Deepika Padukone; I would have like to have seen more of this from him.] Boman Irani was excellent, as usual - this man seems to be able to handle any role, whether dramatic or comedic. Vivaan Shah did a nice job as the nerdy hacker. And, as expected, Shah Rukh Khan did a good job as Charlie, the ring leader, making it seem believable that he could motivate this motley crew of misfits to actually pull of a major heist. Overall, this film is worth seeing. Just don't expect too much.",1427587200,,2156,4.782258064516129

6929288,3,B00RE5Z0UE,"Dazzling Blu-Ray showcases vibrant production numbers without any annoying ads. Farah Khan delivers some of her best choreography with amazing costumes, songs, and sets. Alas, everything else is flat out uninspired. Insipid plot. Who wrote this drivel?  Shah Rukh Khan is simply horrid playing a character with zero charm. He is in great shape but you'd think he could shell out a few rupees and get his stained dentures whitened. What was Abhishek thinking when he signed on for this third rate fiasco?  Deepika  Padukone is radiant and is the only decent character worth watching. Three stars strictly for the song and dance sequences. Interesting costume-on-fire effect seems to have been copied from The Hunger Games flics. tsk,tsk.",1426982400,,736,5.220338983050848
6929289,5,B00RE5Z0UE,"Ok if YOU are expecting a ""typical"" Bollywood movie this is not the one. Well I have seen some bad reviews but in MY CASE I just love it. I know that this movie was more ""commercial"" than others SHARUKH'S KHAN movies. THE MOVIE is not a love story is JUST COMEDY ""that's it"". The only thing that I didn't like that every time it comes a song it appears on the top of the screen that if you want this song as a ringtone or so text this and I think that ""this kind of thing"" was not good for the movie HONESTLY .But otherwise for me was a nice comedy. Also I went to SLAM THE TOUR and was so cool as the movie.",1426550400,,608,3.8333333333333335
6929290,3,B00RE5Z0UE,"BTW, if you are reading this - you may have also read the many bad reviews that accompanied this film. All of the critics have been unanimous in their assessment that this is a movie that must be avoided at any cost. This movie sucked for them and they want it to suck for you. However some actors are above critical assessments of their movies. Salman Khan, Rajnikanth and SRK are actors who have fans that do not necessarily care about reviews, they just want to see their favorite star on the screen. These same fans have made Kick- a very weak film, a big success. So will the fans of SRK, who don't care what they see as long as they have their favorite star on camera
I think Farah Khan is not only a great choreographer but also a good director I loved Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om. Her outings such as Tees Maar Khan were horrible. There are certain actor - director combinations that are just unbeatable. Amitabh Bachchan- Prakash Mehra, Bachchan  and Manmohan Desai, Rajesh Khanna- Shakti Samanta. Farah Khan and SRK ignite the same chemistry as the other legends. I had hoped that they would create magic with Happy New Year - it almost works but not quite. Right of the bat I will say that this is a weak movie- considering the SRK - Farah Khan combination but is the movie  that bad ? - NO. However, its strictly for SRK fans.
Its three hours long and I was watching everything unfold with interest - I watched it in a packed auditorium and the only people who were leaving the auditorium were the old folks for the loo break.
SRK is Charlie and he wants to avenge the humiliation and death of his father Anupam Kher at the hands of Charan Grover ( Jackie Shroff). So he assembles his team of Charlie's Angels with Jag ( Sonu Sood) a deaf army man,- who is completely wasted in this role save for a few fight scenes. Tammy ( Boman Irani)-  a safecracker -  was very irritating and that was the whole point of his role. Nandu Bhide ( Abhishek Bachchan) the best part of this gang and gives the best laughs. It is very unfortunate to see him languishing because he is a very good actor. Rohan (Vivaan Shah) has nothing to do but say a few lines.
Their plan is to participate in the World Dance Championship and break in to the vault that belongs to Charan Grover and steal his diamonds.
Mashing up all these elements requires a skillful director and that Farah Khan manages to do quite nicely as these situations are easily woven. However I seriously expected much more from the SRK- Farah Khan combo especially since SRK's own company was producing the film.
The filming is great and the sets opulent- the movie looks grand and the makers have spared no expense. Since this is a film about a dance competition, I was expecting great music and that the music was so bad was in itself such a letdown. Vihsal Shekhar might have had a great run in the past but they have no tunes left in them. A movie about music and dance and not a single memorable tune. However Vishal Dadlani - the actor makes a cameo in a puke inducing scene with Anurag Kashyap- seriously the only time I felt like walking out of the movie.
SRK has the meatiest role as expected and he drives the movie on an empty tank on sheer star power...Farah Khan has a lot of homework to do before her next film. I hope the next three releases from SRK , Raees, Fan and the Rohit Shetty film erase the memories of this new year. Bad movie - No way....but could have been much much better.

6929293,5,B00RE5Z0UE,"I love just about everything Shah Rukh Khan is in so I might be a little biased in my reviews. To me this was pure fun, the kind of movie where you don't expect lessons learned or a moral to the story or take it seriously. If that's what you're looking for you probably won't like this movie. It's one of my ""escape"" movies, where I can just take time out to immerse myself in the charm, charisma, romance and humor of SRK, the hilarious and even sometimes downright silly antics, and the expected happy ending. I like the pairing of SRK with Farah Khan--they really make a great team. To me this had the same kind of feel as Om Shanti Om--more humor, but the same kind of over-the-top factor. The whole supporting cast was great, too, and picked perfectly for their roles. I think Boman Irani especially was. The music also  was fun and made me feel like jumping up and dancing.

It's simply great entertainment, and not meant to be a culturally significant film or an award winner (just my opinion). I have loved each of the movies that Farah has made with SRK. They are just so much fun, and I really love Farah's brand of humor. And to have a film with SRK, Deepika, Abhishek, Boman, and Sonu all in one film was amazing.

However, if you want to see what's wrong with the discs themselves, read the review by Rob posted on Feb. 8, 2015. I agree with almost everything he said, except for the subtitles issue. They displayed just fine for me. (Excellent review, by the way.)
