8555482,5,B00AOR476M,"The DVD is great and it arrived pretty quickly. My only issue with the DVD is the pace. It is so slow compared to the Scenic Argyll Scotland Virtual Jog & Bike Ride Scenery DVD. I dunno, I guess I assumed the pace would be varied like the other DVD...which started off slow then picked up in pace. This Connemara Ireland DVD...the pace is at times agonizingly slow...more like the pace for a jogger.",1437004800,,399,4.405405405405405
