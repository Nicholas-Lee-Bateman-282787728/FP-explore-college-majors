8071528,4,B000A0LAI6,"I watched ""Journey of the Heart,"" a 56-minute documentary about the life of Henri Nouwen, with a group as we began our book club journey through his classic ""The Return of the Prodigal Son.""  Most of the folks in our group were largely unfamiliar with Nouwen's life and work, and many of them had never heard of him before, so I thought we would do well to get to know Nouwen the man before trying to understand Nouwen the author.  And the documentary served our purposes quite well.

An hour is clearly insufficient to exhaustively address every single event in the life of a man as accomplished, active, and complex as Nouwen, but this film managed to cover a lot of ground.  His academic achievements were discussed.  His most renowned books were mentioned and briefly explained.  His struggles and wounds were described.  And his counter-cultural transition from professorship to pastor at L'Arche was captured in some detail.

Most of the key relationships in Nouwen's life were represented among the many interviews, including several siblings, academic colleagues, spiritual advisors, and L'Arche staff and core members.  And these folks did not attempt to ignore or gloss over some of the very real challenges of Nouwen's life, instead following his lead in acknowledging his woundedness to the world, an exemplary if vulnerable approach to leadership and ministry.  Though Nouwen was consistently acclaimed and praised, he was never deified, as is so easily done in this type of posthumous work.

The real highlight of the production for me were the clips that featured Nouwen himself, whether preaching, serving the community at L'Arche, or sitting/walking/gesticulating for an interview.  His dynamism, compassion, and authenticity shone through in each of these settings, and I was deeply affected by even just a few minutes sitting at the videotaped feet of this great and broken man of God.  What a real treat for those of us who didn't have the privilege of knowing Nouwen personally!

To be sure, this isn't a blockbuster feature film.  The pacing drags a bit at times.  The production values were somewhat less than world-class.  But even if it wasn't earth-shatteringly magnificent, this was a quality, worthwhile documentary about the life of Henri Nouwen.  I am confident that our book club participants now know who this man was and why his influence remains so strong, decades after his death.  I'm happy to recommend ""Journey of the Heart"" to anyone who wants to get to know this beautiful, winsome, gracious, wounded, beloved lover of God who was Henri Nouwen.",1467936000,,2584,5.066193853427896

An intimate look at the life of Henri Nouwen.  I was moved to tears in watching the DVD about this wonderful Man of God.
Anyone familiar with Nouwen's most famous book ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" knows what incredible insight and wisdom is shared in the book in such an intimate and detailed manner that could only have come from a man that walked with the Spirit of Jesus. The thing that impressed me most about the book is better summed up by something Phillip Yancey said when he once described Nouwen as one of ""Holy Inefficiency"" and by that he meant that especially in Nouwen's later years with his incredible intellect he spent time with the mentally challenged ministering to those that would never know or understand Nouwen's reputation as one of the world's most profound Christian spiritual leaders and writers of our time.
Seeing and hearing him in the DVD format from his early years with his ""successes"" as the world would define with an example of having one of the largest classes at Harvard University in it's history to his real success of drawing thousands to a closer relationship with Jesus and ministering to those that could show nothing in return.
A video anyone should watch if they want to be challenged in their Christian walk and be challenged to reach out to others in need.",1246320000,11,1492,5.2426778242677825
8071532,5,B000A0LAI6,"This documentary is a lovely, honest, and inspiring tribute to a man who has influenced the spirituality of a century. Nouwen held nothing back from his students, his family, his co-workers, or his readers, and this presentation holds nothing back as well. As I experienced the friendship and love of those interviewed, my overwhelming desire was to share this portrayal with everyone I know who has been touched by this man's deep and abiding understanding of God's love and care for us through all events in our lives. The Spirit of God moved mightily in this man and he serves as an inspiration that we, too, can know God more deeply with each mindful moment that we offer to Him.",1194912000,14,683,4.7
