8328528,5,B001NZF1OQ,"Great Safety Video
Pretty much All the Bill Nye Videos are great and my kids love them.
Watch them over and over and actually learn information unlike most other school type videos.
It's great that science and knowledge is finally COOL and society is finally drifting away from ignorance and stupidity.",1395878400,,302,4.9411764705882355
8328529,5,B001NZF1OQ,"I love, love, LOVE this series of ""Safety Smart"" DVDs.  Bill Nye makes science FUN!  Learning about electricity can be a challenge, but Bill Nye breaks it down in terms most people can understand.  The skits make an impact with kids, and we can't wait to try some of the experiments.  Yes, the DVD is a little pricey.  But when you factor in the educational value, it's worth every penny.",1344038400,2,388,4.485714285714286
8328530,5,B001NZF1OQ,"check if your local libraries carry Bill Nye shows because many of them are very expensive. Safety Smart Electricity is very educational even for adults but is kind of a short show, and best for older kids because some science experiments are dangerous if kids were to copy them on their own, but my 9 year old boy loves Bill Nye, he is very funny, fast moving and educational at the same time",1291939200,3,393,4.397260273972603
