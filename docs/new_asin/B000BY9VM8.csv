8094055,4,B000BY9VM8,"In his directorial debut, Kwang-chun Park shows us just how eager he was to use every idea in his head: Toemarok (aka ""The Soul Guardians"") bounces between genres like a hyperactive child flipping through cable channels. Horror fans may find it too diluted with non-horror aspects (and not ""scary"" enough), while other audiences may not be particularly keen on the gore or romance or fantasy or action sequences. All of this is enhanced by state of the art [1998] special effects. A flying dagger with personality? You bet! A kid who can summon an ethereal creature based on a video game he plays? Sure, why not! A decapitated soldier's head rolling into traffic to be squashed by a truck? You can't go wrong by adding that.

Meet the most attractive auto mechanic in Asia if not the world, Seung-heui (Chu Sang-mi), whose mom survived a Satanic cult's mass suicide 20 years ago only long enough to give birth to her. The devil has plans for Seung-heui: ""he"" is going to use her body to get his foot in the door and then presumably roam Earth to steal candy from children, urge Mr. Depp to take another swig and throw his phone at Ms. Heard again, and advise Trump further on how to fool fools.
Since you can't have Satan without religion, one of our protagonists is Father Park (played by Ahn Sung-ki, a movie star in Korea) who is sure to mention Jesus at least once and is persona non grata in church anymore because he rants non-stop about Satan. Oddly, the story doesn't stick with Catholicism, it also blends Eastern hocus pocus into the almost incomprehensible mix. There's a supernatural little boy who hangs out with Father Park (no, get your mind out of the gutter) in the fight against Lucifer, and they are joined by Hyun-am (Shin Hyeon-jun), who wields a soul-endowed ""sword"" and can heal himself by taking a hot bath (watching made me yearn for a hot bath: you've been warned!) The kid Jun-hu (Oh Hyeon-chul) is skilled at white magic, and it's never explained how he knows Father Park or Hyun-am, but the three of them live on a retired war ship. This is all completely normal, of course.

Despite obvious flaws, my jaw was so busy hitting the floor every few minutes that I just didn't care about what could have been done better. You know the problem with Hollywood? Not making movies like this!! Sure it's disjointed, but a sloppy story is better than a predictable one.

A few favorite lines:
- ""I guess the devil's taste in women is as good as mine""
- ""Orphans like us have this sickness: Post Natal Affection Deprivation.""
- Detective: ""If you're in this business long enough, the dead will appear in your dreams to tell you who the murderer is.""",1464307200,,2667,4.610526315789474
