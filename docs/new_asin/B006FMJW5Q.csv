8497093,5,B006FMJW5Q,"The Silent Movie Theater/Cinefamily declared this the HFS film of 2011, and it was a wise choice. Shot with home video equipment, SONG OF THE BLIND GIRL is a hodgepodge of everything the filmmakers were pissed off in the five days it took to shoot the film. Veterans rights, child abduction, child prostitution, holocaust revisionism - along with everything and anything that fell in their collective craw that week. Two girls, a teenager and a girl of about 10 or 11 are abducted by a long-haired, bearded maniac - too close to the type of gent one meets in front of blood donor clinics, and he subjects them to a series of psychological abuses. The older girl gets ""Stockholm's syndrome,"" and begins to treat her abductor as her father. It all ends horribly. The acting is beyond horrible, the lighting on the level of a home movie  -- we could go on and on. I fully support this red-headed stepchild of a film as it represents a truly individual and personal vision and trounces the viewer's head with it! Shut up and eat your dog soup!",1351814400,3,1039,4.586021505376344
