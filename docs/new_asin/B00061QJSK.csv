2157085,5,B00061QJSK,"I have to argee this show was great. I too, wish jms could have finshed the series but WB pulled it. When Scf show them that was nice too, but only for like two weeks then they stop? If any one who read this, is a huge B5 fans then chances are you will like this as well.",1098662400,14,271,3.689655172413793
2157086,4,B00061QJSK,"Crusade was a well casted series with the potential for a great future.

It started slow like B5 without a lot of definition to the story arc, and the special effects were not all that at times... but the show had already developed a community feel to the well drawn characters, and as usual the dialog was top notch per jms standards.

After the cancellation jms eventually laid out what would've been the future of the story arc, and I gotta say that with this cast this is one story I would've loved to seen come to fruition.

As for the reference in the following review that the show was cancelled due to lack of popularity, this does not appear to be the case at all.

According to jms (and granted its a biased source, but he's not one to modify the facts), TNT just decided the show didn't fit into their type of programming.  Audiences were tuning in for that show only, and not staying.  So they tried to mess with the show and then eventually pulled the plug.  And because they don't didn't want to look stupid if the show were a success elsewhere, they wouldn't let the rights go for any reasonable sum of money.

Crusade was a good show with great potential and a good cast.  The show grew on me with repeated viewings.  Not to be missed - especially by B5 fans.",1097193600,389,1275,4.341772151898734
2157087,3,B00061QJSK,"here is one major reason this series failed: If they were supposed to be going out to unexplored space to find a cure for the plague, then why were they back at Earth every other episode.  I think many viewers either started loosing interest or completely lost interest because the show was going no where.  In 13 episodes they went to two or three new places, Babylon 5 and Earth like seven times.  Hello, get on with the mission.  I know there is a long term view but you have to grab viewers and keep them interested.  The show simply 100% failed to do that.  I am going to buy this DVD, but that is just my opinion on why it failed as a series.",1097193600,10,648,4.144
2157088,4,B00061QJSK,"I really enjoyed these 13 episodes, and wish that JMS had a chance to write this story the way he wanted.  He did so well with Babylon 5, why couldn't the studio just trust his judgement?",1096416000,21,187,4.194444444444445
2157089,5,B00061QJSK,"Crusade was to put it shortly a screw up from day one. The problem was not with the creator, cast, central idea, stories or potential for it to last 5 seasons which was the plan all of which were excellent. As other reviewers have stated if this had gone all the way I am sure it would proudly have stood alongside Babylon 5. Instead some cretinous short sited moronic powers that be tried to put pressure on JMS to turn this into Baywatch in space. He quite rightly pulled the plug rather than watch the show degenerate into something it was not meant to be. Over the course of the 13 episodes we were only given tantalising glimpses of what could have been. Gary Cole in particular was excellent as the mercurial Matthew Gideon. I knew he was absolutely right for the role as he brought that essential blend of authority, and humour while being of-kilter at the same time. The rest of the cast over the 13 episodes showed signs of settling well into their characters. The search for the cure to the Drakh plague was only the beginning of the story and was due to take in the long term consequences of shadow Technology not just the virus. Buy this set and wonder what would have come next. I personally imagine that Gideon would have found the cure and at the end married Captain Lochley. One can only hope that the story mght be finished in some way at some time but in the meantime I will make up my own ending. Buy this set and dream. Peace. Out.",1096070400,167,1451,4.357933579335794
2157090,5,B00061QJSK,"Crusade had the perfect cast, the perfect creator and primary writer (J. Michael Strazynski), wonderful characters, beautiful music, and it was killed before a single episode was aired. I admire the creator of the series and loathe those who killed it.

If you have seen any of Babylon 5 or the special movies made for TV related to Babylon 5, you know the quality of production and writing  potential Crusade had going for it. Crusade was to be another arc of an unfolding story from JMS within the Babylon 5 universe. In the precious 13 episodes that were completed the viewer gets only a small look at what might have been. The Babylon 5 TV Movie ""A Call to Arms"" was the lead in, not really a pilot, but a way of setting the stage for Crusade with some characters from both series.

If there is justice in the universe, JMS will one day be permitted to make Crusade as he envisioned it. Then the rest of us will watch it, and later when it is available, we will purchase it.",1095811200,239,978,4.392265193370166
2157091,5,B00061QJSK,"It's an old story but new vision.

  Five years after the events of Babylon 5, a group of explorers search for a cure to stop a deadly virus before it kills every single being in earth in five years, but in their mission they will discover the true legacy of the Shadows the race who nearly destroy every single specie in the last big war.

  Straczynsky took the classic story about the space explorers to put a dark vision about how the past of race and some people became the seed of the future conflict.

  The cast it's perfect and some stories are just incredible specially the original first episode Racing the night (forget warzone, it's the only one who doesn't fit with the style of the other stories).

  For those who want even more read The Passing of the techomages, Trilogy, fits perfect in some episodes",1095206400,11,819,4.496598639455782

Poor choice of cast along with poor writing are really just symptoms of a bad concept and general idea as the whole basis and foundation of the show is flawed.  If earth had five years to live would they only send one ship and one captain to find a cure.  Would the crew be so easily distracted to go on missions that had nothing to do with finding a cure?  And since the Drakh came from Zahadun (or what ever its called) why not start there?  Oh, wait, that would just be too smart for the entire human race to figure out.  The starting place should have been Zahadun, with several mysterious places that clues gleaned from there would have brought them.  Perhaps a visit to some of the planets  that were inhabited by the first ones before Shariden convinced them to leave.  And if the shadows could leave behind the drakh why couldn't the first ones leave behind some other younger races who were just as elusive as they were with perhaps equal or better technology than the Drakh.

It wasn't completely awful.  The acting wasn't that bad.  If the show was given a chance, it could have gotten much better.  If you want to watch a great show that cut off before it even got started - well, there's Firefly.  But Crusade wasn't that bad.  Yeah, the special effects were cheaper than Babylon 5's.

You would think a spin-off of a somewhat popular, at its time, sci-fi series would have had a fair shake... but nope, this bad boy was crushed as hard as a new material series, like Firefly.  And, it is unfortunate.

There was so much potential, if they just gave it time.  They had the ""explore worlds"" angle that is a staple of sic-fi series like Stargate or Star Trek.  They had a build up universe already there to work with, B-5 universe had many aliens, myths, and lore bits to explore.  They updated the CGI of B-5 in many places, making space sequences more appealing.  And while many of the characters were weak or one dimensional, a few had merit.  I mean, Galen alone was a treat to watch, when he was around.

Would it have been a 5+ season run, like B-5?  Doubt it.  But, it could have held its own, if it had a fair start.  Unfortunately, we'll never know what could have been.  So, it sits on my shelf next to other ""what if"" series that died before their time.

2157357,3,B00061QJSK,"I have recently finished watching all of the Babylon 5 boxed set and several of the spin-offs and I was very happy with everything that I have seen until I watched Crusade on a suggestion from a friend. I watched the episodes in the official chronological order by Straczynski and I was glad I did. which is as follows:
1 ""War Zone""
2 ""The Long Road""
3 ""Ruling from the Tomb""
4 ""Appearances and Other Deceits""
5 ""The Memory of War
6 ""The Needs of Earth""
7 ""Racing the Night""
8 ""Visitors from Down the Street""
9 ""Each Night I Dream of Home""
10 ""The Path of Sorrows""
11 ""Patterns of the Soul""
12 ""The Well of Forever""
13 ""The Rules of the Game""

The problem with this series is that the story-lines are very compressed and there is not a lot of character building dialog that allows you to discover all the details of any particular person. There is a lot of ""I'm the captain, that's why"" and ""That's how it is, take it or leave it"" type dialog. They did not have the time to flesh out the personalities and nuances that made you love the or hate the characters. In Babylon 5 for example, the character development was so great that you really had a feeling of who these people were and why.
I think the problems stem from a combination of the studio not getting it and simply the year it was produced. Shows back in the late nineties and early 2000's were unfortunately balanced against outrageous viewership numbers and many outstanding shows never had a chance to grow. Firefly was another show that was a casualty of the same viewership issues. If Firefly was released today and received the numbers it garnered back in 2002 we would still be watching it.

I love the B5 universe! It is so rich with great ideas that it should warrant another re-write and screening. Imaging the entire B5 universe recaptured with today's technology! When they re-imagined the Battlestar Galactica series I was outraged that they would attempt such a thing and refused to watch the blasphemous rewrite of one of my most beloved shows from my childhood! I was so way beyond wrong on every level! Battlestar Galactica is a prime example of what a show could become when the writers have a lot of control! I tried watching the original Battlestar Galactica and was almost embarrassed at how bad it was.

So the point of all this rambling is I think the entire B5 storyline needs to be updated for a new generation and Crusade needs to be re-conceived  because there is a lot of substance left here to be explored.

It's a must see set for any huge B5 fan and the price is right. so get it but don't expect the richness of B5",1363824000,,2606,4.432150313152401

There's an actual explanation in the special features, where they filmed several episodes, then essentially refilmed them with a higher budget, but refused to throw out the old ones, leaving the show with costume changes and establishing simple things multiple times.

It had a lot of promise, and I'm sorry the show didn't make it.  Still, it's not necessary unless you already know you enjoy it.",1356998400,2,487,4.773809523809524

Crusade  possessed some of the best sci-fi I have ever seen!  And as many other members have noted - it is ridiculous that the ""bean counters"" of TNT canceled this potentially excellent series.
 As in Star Trek (yes I'm more of a trekker but I love B5) the episodes are mostly ""morality plays"" with strong undertones of secular humanism.  JMS manages to make his primary characters more personally flawed but with the potential to go through great transformations.  For example, G'Kar changes radically during the B5 series - from raving militarist to enlightened philosopher.  There is similar evidence that the characters in Crusade will transform their ""habits of mind"" as well...witness Gideon's apparent increasing reliance on the apocalypse box and Maxmillian becoming motivated to action beyond the profit motive.
There is a beginning of a story arc being generated in this partial first season by JMS.  JMS did virtually the same thing with B5 during the first season he apparently was doing the same with Crusade.  It is a incredible waste that TNT just dropped this potentially outstanding series!",1356739200,6,1294,5.21256038647343

And there was a driving mission -- to find a cure for a plague that threatened to destroy humanity -- except that quite often that pressing need got shoved on the back burner while the main actors dealt with some other problem, sometimes rather mundane. There were assorted little continuity problems, at times writing that was pretty sappy, and special effects that ranged from pretty good to slightly amusing in a bad way. Sounds like pretty much of a loser to me, and Crusade was just that, at least as measured by the length of its paltry run. Still, there are elements that suggest this might have been a reasonably good science fiction series had it been given enough time to find its legs. It already had a wealth of background from Babylon 5 to draw upon, and despite the silly words that were sometimes put into their mouths, the cast was more than credible and had the spark that could have made them truly endearing. I think one can be rewarded by watching this series and viewing it more in terms of its potential rather than by what it actually accomplished, which really was not a whole heck of a lot.

The chance to see it without advertisements was the thrill I was hoping to get and was not disappointed. I had nearly forgotten how detailed the stories were and how linked each episode was.

Some years later, J. Michael Straczynski, creator of Babylon 5, put together his answer to Star Trek: Voyager, with the mission statement of ""HERE'S how you do a quest show!""  The result was Crusade, where we follow the adventures of the crew of the Earth Alliance Starship Excalibur, on a quest to find a cure to a plague inflicted on Earth by the Drakh.  They have five years to find a cure and get it back or every living thing on Earth dies (interesting how the concept of a ""five year mission"" came about, ain't it?)

Forget it.  This show bites.

The ideas, acting, and scenarios are bad.  NO suspension of disbelief.  Poor set-up, bad history, and doesn't fit well with the rest of the B5 universe as previously set forth.  JMS railed against the changes force on him by Turner's people - some of those changes were actually the BETTER ideas put forward in the show (the mystery box, changing character dynamics, etc).

Most of the episodes contain at LEAST one fall-down laughing BAD moment.  When you get to the Joan-of-Arc-channeling terrorist or the Mr. Kitty episode, you will know what I mean.

If you are a B5 fan, AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE.  It was actually DIMINISH your appreciation of the B5 franchise.",1335312000,3,756,4.790697674418604

However, because there are only 13, and so far as I know, there will never be more, I would not recommend anyone but a fan of Babylon 5 buy this set. Its a great show, but as there will never be a payoff, you'll just find yourself wanting more & disappointed when there isn't any.

That said, if you like Babylon 5, you should watch this series. If you like J. Michael Strazcynski (that's probably spelled wrong), you should check it out as well. You'll enjoy every minute. I haven't checked out the special features yet, so I can't speak about them, but the quality of the video is excellent, and the case more than sufficient to protect your DVD's if you aren't doing something odd with them.",1331164800,,957,4.346368715083799
2157433,3,B00061QJSK,"This is an interesting series that grew out of the vastly more successfull Babylon 5.

Tracy Scoggins is one of the premier highlights in the show in her limited cameo appearances, and those fall rather short of Golden Globe material.

The plot is simple, it should have been a winner like the original Star Trek, after an interstellar war Earth's premier flagship is dispatched to uncover a cure for a plague that Earth's been infected with. It's a 5 year mission to explore strange new worlds and search for said cure.

The story is set, the characters develop in the first few shows and then one gets the sense it all starts to go horribly wrong from the Screenwriter's perspective.

The storyboards become wooden, the actors keep up their end of the bargain, but there's only so much they can accomplish alone.

The series does take some interesting twists and turns with character development, species origination and using the episodes to look more intensively at the characters which lie within each of us.

The series was obviously prematurley cancelled by the networks as it just stops. No climax, no sequel, nothing like an end of season finale. It's just over.

In all fairness to the concept it would probably have done much better had it not been released at a time of massive sci-fi saturation on network television.

Overall I'd give as follows.

Sorylines - 3 stars
Acting - 3 stars

This had to be the worst science-fiction series I have ever seen. The writing was sloppy, story lines confusing and special effects and props/ models very amateurish. The first few episodes were very difficult to get through. They made almost no sense at all. Subsequent episodes smoothed out and started to show some improvement as the characters developed a little, but overall I found it to be a complete waste of time and money. Sad too, as I have seen the actors in other roles and they were all quite talented and convincing, but in this series not so. As a result I'd have to conclude the problem had to be the script.

Where have I heard that before?  They were racing from one part of the galaxy to another in a race to find the means to save Earth.  That automatically meant that for all five years, except the last 3 or 4 episodes, they would fail.  While some episodes were interesting, you knew each week, they would come up empty.

Now, let's talk about the music score.  I have never had to endure such a barrage of atonal plonking in my entire life.

I won't talk about the acting.  Almost every new show has a period where the actors have not quite gotten into their characters, and Crusade was no exception.

I think JMS laid an egg with Crusade.

2157480,4,B00061QJSK,"Everyone who knows B5 lore already knows the story of the ""Crusade"" series so I'll skip the angsty polemic.

When Crusade aired in the summer of 1999 on TNT, I was hungry for the B5 story to continue... in pretty much any form. At the time I was uncritically admiring of the show. It was a stillborn scrap and I'd take it.

Since that time 11 years ago, so bloody much Sci-Fi on TV has aired that owes its look, feel and scripting style to the little universe that JMS created for Babylon-5. Much of the Stargate franchise, for example, feels like a B5 imitation with the dark sets and the multi year story arcs.

Crusade also had that strong feeling of a story that could and should be continued. Instead, we now have to be satisfied with an incomplete run of one season of a story that could have been. Other SF shows with strong promise have been cut off at the knees after one season: Firefly, and more recently, ABC's ""Life on Mars"", ""Defying Gravity"", and ""Flash Forward"".

So, Crusade, forgive me, but it has been 11 years since we last parted ways. I WANT to learn and understand and really feel for your characters. But being shafted out of your promise of a majestic story, as well as several other series' aborted liftoffs in the last decade, makes me skeptical of investing the emotional energy again. It's a merry go round. So, not this time.

The acting is very good to excellent... the scripts are not terribly tight - there is too much talk for my taste and verges on the tedious at times. The characters are generally sympathetic but a few like ""Trace"" come off as half-baked and awkward. There is the doctrinaire ""violent extremist religion is bad, m'kay?"" episode, which aired two years before 9/11 happened. The entire show has very non literalistic, metaphoric elements like a recurring ""mystical search for truth"" schtick that (IMO) compromise the action.

And you get to see a pre-Lumbergh Gary Cole sans red stapler wielding office nerds. He starred in ""Office Space"" immediately after this series was made, and the show's trivia states that he wore the prop Earthforce Academy ring while filming ""Office Space.""

But, it's a different flavor of B5. And if you love B5, you really should own it.

The DVD is spartan and dead to the extreme. Each disk lands you in a very static home page screen with no music or animation.",1281312000,,2346,4.595693779904306

2157483,5,B00061QJSK,"Michael Straczynski's Crusade series is a spinoff off of the Bab-5 universe. It deserved better from television executives.

Straczynski's characters are compelling, making you ask for more, and he raises a series of superb philosophical questions on human existence, ethics, and the lengths one goes to survive that surfaces throughout the episodes. He introduces new aliens, develops the mysterious Techno-Mages, and offers a new Earth exploratory vessel with a plot that has the ""time-bomb"" ticking from the outset--Earth that will die in a matter of years unless a cure is found. The background is solid Bab-5 material, the new characters are well acted, and the writing is superb! Plots from each episode are conventional, but the over-arching storyline had a direction that was intensely interesting and was clearly being arranged by Michael Straczynski's to encompass more than just a year.

I fear that some in Hollywood are too PC, perhaps, not liking the name of the series and leveraged its cancellation. Yet, I find Straczynski weaves common motifs and aspects of human history into the SF fabric with great skill--they should let him tell the whole tale--everything has a purpose with Straczynski. Quite frankly, I miss the grand scale of his elegant universe with characters that change over time--a contrast to many current SF series using bobbing cameras, erratic frames, dark sets, and gritty characters that never really mature or arc into something. It's a matter of taste... I know.

There are a few subtle bumps in the opening season (slight changes in uniform designs, etc.), but nothing that diminishes from the powerful characters, solid background, theme and plot structures. I hope some cable division or network will give Michael Stracyznski an opportunity to bring Crusade or some similar spinoff to life.

2157499,4,B00061QJSK,"Season V of Babylon 5 ended in a way that had us gasping for air, reaching for tissues, and wanting more B5. The films, The Legend of the Rangers and the Crusade series helped keep the dream alive, as do the Lost Tales, so that sometime in the not-so-distant future we can have a B5-universe series to look forward to.
The Shadow Wars ended with the Drakh unleashing their deadly virus on Earth and contaminating the planet's population. Crusade brings to the screen the adventures of the command crew of the new Earth-Minbari hybrid Destroyer-class Excalibur under Captain Matthew Gideon as it travels around the universe looking for a cure for the Drakh plague, while the clock is ticking with less than five years left before humanity on Earth is something of the past.
The series starts off rather bland with the first four episodes testing my resolve to watch the series through. However, Crusade eventually picks up as the actors get accustomed to one another and the audience gets accustomed to them.
On the down side, Captain Gideon (brings to mind Kevin Bacon) does not have that special something that Sinclair and Sheridan had.
Moreover, the acting, the dialogues, and at times the CGI are not that great, and that does have an effect on the overall enjoyment.
In addition, neither Marjean Holden nor her character (Sarah Chambers) was all that likable; no comparison at all to Dr. Franklin!
Finally, the poor music is not enjoyable in the least and it makes you want to hurt someone!
On the positive side, it is such a pleasure to see Tracy Scoggins and the late Richard Biggs.
Moreover, my initial thoughts of Crusade's command crew being set up a bit like Dungeons and Dragons with the mage, the thief, the telepath, the warrior, even the grouchy cavalier (from the D&D cartoon) in the obnoxious archaeologist etc. were confirmed when Straczynski actually mentions it in the extra features, which are definitely worth viewing.
It is a shame that Crusade was cancelled before it was given the chance to fully bloom. It was supposed to run for 5 years, but they pulled the plug after only 13 episodes. In conclusion, though it does not start strong, Crusade grows on you. Hopefully, the fans loyalty and undying desire for more B5 will result in another spinoff, this one with the potential to stay the course. 3.8 Stars",1258416000,2,2332,4.7890818858560795

The TNT Memo
08 September 1998 - Ain't It Cool News broke the story of an alleged TNT memo that expressed a desire for more sex and violence in Crusade.

Confirmation from JMS
19 September 1998 - JMS confirmed that the TNT memo did exist, but had been resolved to his satisfaction.

The Hiatus
22 September 1998 - JMS announced that new sets would be constructed during an extended hiatus.

The New First Episode
08 October 1998 - JMS announced that a new introductory episode would be filmed and that the costumes had been changed.

Integrity Intact
10 October 1998 - JMS assured the fans that the changes in episode order, costumes, and sets would improve the show.

Explaining the Changes
11 January 1999 - Ain't It Cool News reported on how the costume and set changes would be explained in the episode ""Appearances and Other Deceits"".

The Cancellation Rumor
29 January 1999 - JMS responded to a TNT cancellation rumor by announcing another hiatus and urging fans to contact the Sci-Fi Channel.

The Cancellation Announcement
26 February 1999 - JMS announced that the Sci-Fi Channel didn't have the money in its budget for Crusade and that TNT would air the 13 episodes already filmed.

TNT WAS the reason why this show was canceled.  JMS didn't want to ruin the show with senseless violence and sex.  He did not give in to their demands.  This show was starting out slowly just like season 1 of Babylon 5 did.  TNT ticks me off to no end because of what they tried to do to this show and I commend JMS for not giving in.

I suspect though that eventually there will be a DVD movie, mini-series, or a theatrical movie of Babylon 5 in the future that will give some closure to this series in some way.",1252627200,,1797,4.537267080745342

But Crusade is much worse, in my opinion.  It is as bad as Andromeda, except Andromeda was allowed to linger on for years.

I consider myself a Bablyon 5, but if you are honest enough with yourself to admit the decline in quality starting in series 5, then Crusade will just make you irritated and annoyed.

2157507,3,B00061QJSK,"While it was interesting to see a fresh approach to the Babylon 5 Universe something is off here the ships are there the universe is there but in most respects it is the heart and soul the chemistry of the cast that is missing.

Maybe if it was an entirely different series without the B-5 slant I could be kinder to it but its not and I can't.  If it were about a random group of people in a spaceship finding a cure for a plague maybe but as it stands let me give you the rundown.

First the good

Dureena Nafeel (Carrie Dobro) a thief who does everything see can to get the job done.  I always liked her she can work her way out of a tight spot and think her way out of any given situation.

Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks):in spite of being an overbearing jerk Eilerson does have his moments when those moments come he does show that there is a real person under that brash sarcastic exterior.

Galen (Peter Woodward a technomage the last time we saw these people was in Babylon 5 season two when they were fleeing the approaching shadows Galen interfered on our behalf and as a consequence was banished.  I'll be perfectly honest he was the best part of the show those episodes where something interesting happened were usually about some element of technomageism he carried the show on his own.

Middle of the road

 Lieutenant John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim) there is one particularly good moment with this character when it shows his involvement with a particular raid during the telepath war but most of the time he has Lt. Uhura syndrome he runs ships communications and JMS shows that he is tolerant of other races.

Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole) my problem is he can never decide on which type of captain he wants to be brash and arrogant or diplomatic and sensitive.  Pick a mood for the sake of your crew captain

The bad

Dr. Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden): ship's medical officer.  Think all the self righteousness of Steven Franklin without the sense of humor.

.  Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins)-Whoever came up with this bright idea needs to be punched in a very uncomfortable place it makes no sense take the most unpopular part of season 5 and give her a few guest spots on the new show and just to confuse everyone set her up as Gideon's love interest and make her disappear.  Mindless.

Since the story is cut short of its' intended run, the 13 episodes flesh out the plotline and character development essential for the remaining story we shant ever see.
 Hence I consider the viewing of the included documentary and commentaries in this set as essential to explain the goings on which are tied to events at the conclusion of the B5 movie ""A Call To Arms"" (setting the stage for Crusade). Crusade's story is to find a cure for the Drakh plague unleashed upon Earth at the movies ending, but its' means of telling this story differ greatly from that typically experienced with the Babylon 5 TV series. Crusade takes on a Star Trek mode as the adventure is sought out with the starship Excalibur as opposed to being dropped on the B5 stations' 'doorstep'. Also the incorporation of the mythyical elements of the knights of the round table (the Rangers), Merlin (Galen) and Excalibur become interwoven into this story and create for the B5 fan the opportunity to dream about what this story might have grown into.

I have enjoyed Gary Cole in other roles immensely (Office Space, American Gothic, etc.), and as we've seen, he and others from this series have gone on to star in other shows (Lost, Beastmaster, etc.), but Crusade came out at a time when Hollywood was expecting much more immediate results, and as such it wasn't allowed to blossom into the series that spawned it.

An alien species has infected Earth with a deadly virus.  If a cure isn't found, everyone on Earth will be dead within five years with only the few humans who were on other planets, battleships or space stations at the time of infection being whose left of humanity.

They are to go anywhere and do whatever it takes to succeed in that goal.

It is too bad this series was cut short. It was interesting and Gary Cole made a great lead actor--not your typical stuffy military-type at all. He cheats, he lies, he speaks his mind regardless of rank, and he breaks the rules--but always for the right reasons.

2157549,3,B00061QJSK,"Babylon 5 had a sort of grandeur to it, in the sweep of the story, the relationships between the characters, the social issues that were skewered or commented on, and the galactic peril that developed as its main story arc. It was hoped that Crusade could succeed Babylon 5 for another five successful years, carrying on the history of humans after the Shadow War and the formation of the planetary Alliance.

Crusade was, so to speak, murdered in its crib. It never got much of a chance to grow. It never had all the strengths of its predecessor, and it suffered a few weaknesses as well.

Briefly, what I liked about the series: Galen, the enigmatic techno-mage, who was probably the best actor and got the best speeches. Dureena, the alien thief whose sass was entertaining and whose courage got the Crusade team out of a pickle or two. As the series progressed the crew were starting to develop a sense of family and camaraderie, like the Babylon 5 team. The Excalibur was a pretty ship, and quite a few interior sets were built to show different parts of the craft.

Weaknessess: The special effects of ships in orbit and in battle were good. The special effects of planetary landscapes looked cheap. The musical score wasn't as weighty or as appropriate as the music for Babylon 5. Gary Cole's Captain Gideon is a more flawed and somewhat less heroic figure, compared to B5's Cap'n Sheridan. In a way that makes him more interesting, but he also seems to have a dangerously headstrong or capricious streak. (To say nothing of his questionable tactic of getting advice from an alien machine called an ""apocalypse box"" that has a tendency to give false information.) The lack of a great story arc to tie the episodes together was somewhat of a weakness. Whereas B5 dealt with interplanetary conflicts between whole races, and the war between two super-powerful ancient alien powers, Crusade's plots were narrowly focused on one spacecraft and its mission to find a cure for a planetary plague. The scale is somehow smaller.

After watching all 13 episodes, I find myself overlooking a lot of the ways that it fell short. I'm quite fond of it, and will watch it again from time to time. But it falls short of the standard set by Firefly, or even B5.",1205539200,,2252,4.6936708860759495
2157550,3,B00061QJSK,"CRUSADE is the only spin off of BABYLON 5, but one that never really got off the ground.  Part of the problem is that it never really developed much in the way of compelling internal arcs and part of the problem was that it never was given much time to do so.  BABYLON 5 was a series that was very, very slow to develop.  The first two seasons were quite static and almost dull as various plot elements were slowly dropped into place.  Eventually there was a pay off, and a big one at that.  But the truth is that it was just really slow to develop.  CRUSADE likewise was very slow out of the gate.  Would it have become as good as B5?  There is no evidence of that.  There seems to have been very, very little in the way of long arcs developing, though even in the case of B5 some of the arcs can be seen on reviewing early episodes, but were hard to detect on first viewings.  But the brute fact is that CRUSADE was, through the 13 completed episodes, simply not very exciting.

Just because CRUSADE was not terribly good as executed doesn't mean that it wouldn't have gotten better.  This was not a show without potential.  It did not have the jaw-dropping brilliance that FIREFLY displayed over a comparable number of episodes (which will always ignite the debate over precisely what FOX was thinking when it cancelled that gem), but it nonetheless had potential.

A slowness to develop wasn't the only problem the show had in its short run.  The use of the cast was astonishingly inconsistent.  Now, B5 often would run for several episodes without opening credits characters putting in an appearance, but that was only after they all were firmly established.  CRUSADE might lose a character for three straight episodes.  The only character guaranteed to appear in each episode was Gary Cole.  Tracy Scoggins was an opening credits character but did not finally appear on the show until several episodes into the season.  Peter Woodard, who as the technomage Galen may have been the show's most compelling and fascinating character (certainly he was the only one I wanted to know more about), appeared in only about two-thirds of the episodes.  He tended to be dominant in the ones in which he did appear, but that merely reemphasized his absence in the ones in which he did not.  We did not even begin to scratch the surface of the main characters.  For instance, it appears that Galen was probably a self-created cyborg.  In the last episode in which he appeared we learned that his eyes had been replaced by ocular implants and a brief look at his bare back revealed that he had a number of mechanical implants of one kind or another.

Ultimately, this is a show that simply never came out with all guns blazing.  We'll never know if it had more potential or not.  There were some good individual episodes, as well as some fun ones.  I enjoyed seeing Peter Woodward and his father, the Equalizer himself, Edward Woodward.  And there was a fun late-series episode that was a great parody of THE X-FILES.  The Excalibur finds an alien life pod in open space and picks them up.  Inside are two conspiracy-minded aliens dressed very much in the style of Mulder and Scully.  The female's head tentacles, which resembled hair slightly, were red like Scully's hair and she wore high-heeled shoes under her slacks in the best Scully fashion.  The two accuse the humans of constantly abducting people from their planet and of being involved in a conspiracy with a mysterious man who bears more than a little resemblance to the CSM (that is Cigarette Smoking Man, for non-X-Filers), a resemblance that was cemented when he pulls out a cigarette and lights up as he departs Excalibur.  All in all it was fun.

One thing that they might have done to generate more interest in the show was to have more guest appearances by members of the B5 cast.  Although the show had been set up by A CALL TO ARMS, the series itself was generally devoid of B5 cast members apart from Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley.  But I think that more of an attempt to bring in familiar faces would have helped.  Apart from Scoggins, the only B5 regular to even appear on the show was Richard Biggs as Steven Franklin.

I can't really recommend this series to anyone except BABYLON 5 completists.  If you feel the need to watch absolutely everything connected to B5, go for it.  It seems appropriate that one of the very last scenes on the show occurred when Excalibur was taking Captain Lochley back to B5.",1205020800,4,4477,4.6022727272727275

2157557,4,B00061QJSK,"Crusade became what could easily have happened to Babylon 5,something of great potential cut off before it could really get going.
Luckily for Babylon 5 fans it survived its' five year tenure. Unfortunately Crusade did not. But what potential there was for this series. It had all the same key ingredients;great scripts,great acting,great CGI and great background score by Mr. Chen(who did Call to Arms-a bold but worthwhile gamble).I have never heard the hows and whys of this series demise nor what was in store for the series had it continued. I can only speculate that Mr. Straczynski probably envisioned a similar story arc as B-5 and maybe within the same time period(?).The evidence is resplendent throughout Crusade;
Capt. Gideon(hand picked by Sheridan) uses Sheridans' ship the Excaliber(from a Call to Arms)to go searching for a cure for the Drakh plague on Earth(will they succeed or fail?),they visit the Mars Colony(maybe we would have eventually seen Garibaldi?),Gideon not only meets with Capt. Lochley on B-5 he,well,gets closerthanthis with her(would it be permanent or fleeting?),Dereena Nefil finds a lost tribe of her own kind(they have only a year to live,could she save them!?),Galen comes and goes throughout(does he visit Sheridan,B-5 station or ?, when not with Gideon?),Dr. Franklin(from B-5)is stuck on Earth working from there(will he work more closely with the Ex's crew?),the inevitable telepath wars took place,ended and one of the Ex's crew is a former psi-cop(would we see Mr. Bester reappear?),etc,etc.
I can only conclude that Mr. Straczynski's story arc,if he had this in mind, would have definitely come around to meld with the B-5 universe because Crusade,when all said and done,was just a more thoroughly explored extension of Babylon 5 anyways.
The minuses to this set are as follows:
The set includes very little in the way of extras. Just a few interspersed commentaries and a couple of short featurettes which I am going to watch now that I have finished all the episodes.
It is not filmed in widescreen like the majority of B-5 was.
The price tag for just 13 eps(and what little is included) is very high....much too high.
That's why this set will be bought I think mainly by those who can afford it/and or B-5 compleatists. It is certainly a worthy edition to any B-5 fans' collection. But it is ultimately frustrating to watch knowing even though it widens our scope of the B-5 universe a little more it leaves behind a ton of open ended questions.
We can only hope that Mr. Straczynskis' recent ""Lost Tales"" DVD can kick start the B-5 universe up again so hopefully we can get some kind of closure on the Crusade take on things. There's always hope.",1192752000,,2697,4.982261640798226

Crusade was a natural follow-up of Babylon 5. In the short time it had, unfortunately there wasn't enough time to develop the relationships between the characters, but they had the typical strong, independent, yet mysterious (don't believe what you see) personalities that JMS is so fond of creating.

Clearly, all hope of a return to B5 space weere pinned on this series and we are left wanting in so many ways... The actors while talented either did not have enough character development for us to identify with them or were not given stories compelling enough for viewers to want to know them.

Gary Cole, while being a capable Bingo Bob on the West Wing series does not bring any strong characteristics to his Captain Gideon role. His  fling with B5's Captain Loxly (sp?)is brief and rather unbelievable. There is little dimension to this Captain and that in itself is disappointing to us Sci-Fi fans who have seen stronger characters in many other sci-fi shows.

Lt Matheson starts to be a compelling sidekick to the Captain but theye rarely use Mr Kim's full range. Clearly, this performance was enough to help him land his role in Lost and for good reasons.

I honestly do not know why this series didn't take off.  It was probably poor timing more than anything else.  Unlike Babylon 5, a Crusade has a loosely twined story line.  The story boasts much improved cgi from the original B-5 series.  In addition, the music, though difficult to get used to at first, is not only enchanting, but adds powerful vibes to the show.  Towards the end of the series, I really appreciated the direction MJS went with the production of this series.  Finally, the story was really intriguing.  It was paired by unique and captivating characters.  This series may have been ahead of its time, seeing that the current top sci-fi shows are Stargate and Battlestar Galatica.  It ran along a similar story frame.

Basically, the story begins where Babylon 5 left off.  Earth was poisoned by allies of the Shadows who now haunt the characters at every turn.  It's up to the crew of a special new, high tech ship to scavenger the galaxy to find a cure.  In between, they run into unique worlds and adventures.

Personally, I loved this series.  It had everything that B-5 lacked (don't get me wrong, I loved B-5).  It had crisp imagery, better acting, and more creative sound effects/music.

I cried when I watched the last episode and realized there were no more.  Babylon 5 was one of my top ten favorite television series of all time and this spin off (or follow up) was a worthy successor to the story. Crusade starring Gary Cole (one of the most talented actors working with way too many one season wonders to his credit) had drama, adventure, fantasy and fun.  And it ended way too soon.

Is this show perfect? Hardly.  But it's perfect to own and re-watch again and again.  I need a Matthew Gideon fix periodically and this is the easiest way to get it. I do have one criticism though.  The series was broadcast with episodes out of order and this dvd set follows the incorrect viewing order (as did that venerable unique series American Gothic).  But that's a small price to pay to get more of that wonderful Babylon 5 storytelling from creator JMS.

If you weren't fortunate enough to see this show the first time around on network television, this is a great way to see it.  High points include the neat musical score, fine acting, and wonderful storytelling. I recommend this dvd collection for all fans of science fiction.

2157581,3,B00061QJSK,"I fondly recall my days from college when I and a couple good friends would gather to watch Babylon 5 (B5) as it meandered to more and more obscure timeslots.  I remember cruising the nets (mostly bb service back then) for news and tidbits from JMS, the creator of both series.  I remember ""BAM"" episodes versus story-developing episodes.  To say that I'm a B5 fan is a huge understatement.

I mention all this to provide context for this review.  It's not necessarily a good thing for a reviewer of a spin-off to simultaneously be a fan of the original series, as expectations will generally be higher than for the general audience.  Nevertheless, here I am.

B5 was a true space epic encompassing many overriding plotlines, conspiracies, nuances of character, and psychosocial conundrums.  Crusade has all of these, in their infancy.  We note the barest glint of the underlying arc.  We see the characters developing more than one-dimension.  Sometimes series are cut short when fans know that they could have been great.  With Crusade, it was cut too early to even figure that out.  To paraphrase the increasingly ridiculous Mr. Rumsfeld, Crusade is an ""unknown unknown.""  To newcomers, this may be irrevelant, but to fans it is unbearable.  Anyone who remembers the first time they saw the finale for B5 season three probably also thinks that JMS would have pulled another thriller episode (or 20) out for us.

Crusade, as it is, is not great.  The stories seem unconnected, the characters transparent, the plotlines predictable.  Yet most episodes still entertained.  My criticisms are mostly meant for the ""arc"" structure of the series, or lack of it.  Again, this is probably due to the amputation of the series and not from lack of planning.  If enjoyed with an ""episode"" rather than an ""arc"" frame of mind, one will not be disappointed.

To summarize, for fans a mixed bag:  familiar occasional forays into corny humor, beginnings of deep characterization, hints of underlying plot, and some familiar characters.  For newcomers:  some episodes with excellent action sequences, mystery aplenty, psychological/spiritual dilemmas, and likeable characters (JMS trademark).

If you are new and bored and mildly interested, pick it up, watch it, and forget it.
If you are new and bored and very interested, I seriously recommend picking up the complete B5 series plus movie set before watching this.
If you are a fan of B5, c'mon guys, resistance is futile, so stop mucking around and buy this, for completeness' sake!

Not great, but could (and probably would) have been.  Not unmissable, but a shame for any true fan to miss.

2157583,4,B00061QJSK,"Ok. I was very excited about this show. After B5 was almost cancelled so many times I was shocked to see evidently it was popular enough to generate a spin-off! That like...never happens nowadays.

The premise was great. Even though if you watched B5 you already knew what the ultimate outcome was going to be you could still be excited by the journey. Imagine if you will; the great writing and imagination of JMS and Harlan Ellison that would give you another multi-year story arc, but this time take it away from being anchored to a space station and like Star Trek and so many other shows give it the ability to move about the universe and explore other planets and whatnot. Crusade was open ended. This time with the space ship you could go anywhere. JMS's imagination was the only limit.

Just like B5's first season Crusade started off really slow. When you're setting up for another 5 year story arc you can't just ""blow up"" your way into it. The show had some really really good episodes. The cast was just being introduced and beginning to meld. Every single person that liked B5 know how JMS does. There was no reason to believe the show wasn't going to kick into gear by the end of the first season. I'm still mad at TNT for having the balls to meddle with JMS and his team knowing his track record for success at this sci-fi thing already. Evidently j. Micheal Strayzinski felt the same way because he showed he'd rather have the show discontinued than sacrifice the integrity of the series. It was revealed that the show was getting good ratings but the station wanted more fighting and sex.

The fact that the actors still hung around for a while when the show was put on hiatus atest to the quality of the work being done. The show stopped over corporate b.s. not because the show was [...]

Alas, I can only wonder what kind of wonders JMS would've shown us as the show progressed. Techno Mage saga? Discoveries into Vorlon space? Other ""first ones"" secrets?

Then imagine the wonderful stories that we would've experienced from the JMS crew if the corporate puppet masters would've left the show alone.

There were several minor problems. For example, the costumes were ugly and the captain's in particular looked poorly cut. The musical score was grating and way too distracting during the entire show, especially since it was too loud to tune out.

But the real problem in my view was the total lack of chemistry among the crew, even after all 13 episodes, as opposed to the almost immediate amazing chemistry among the cast of other Sci-Fi series like Farscape or Firefly.

DO buy it. Just don't come to the Crusade series with the same set of expectations, because you're going to be disappointed.

Crusade is a too-perfect example of ""creation by committee."" The REAL main premise of Crusade works, particularly if you followed B5: the servants of the shadows had dropped a plague on the Earth, and the Crusade crew are traveling the universe to find a cure. Unfortunately, the ""creative"" people at TNT, which was better at putting together smack-down wrestling, insisted on making changes to the Crusade premise, characters (they wanted one alien whose main purpose was to have sex with as many races as possible), and even uniforms (which is why JMS had to come up with a hokey episode to change the uniforms).

The result is moments of brilliance, mixed with irritating situations. And, because the TNT people claimed that new watchers wouldn't have a context for the show (although they ended up showing the B5 movie that introduced the plague, right before the season premiere aired), they insisted that the scripts bring everybody up to date. So, Crusade wastes a lot of time telling you what you already know. And, since the story sort-of starts twice, it wastes a lot of time on that. If you're a B5 fan, you know that JMS tends to trust the audience to figure it out as you go along, and he doesn't do that here.

I recently re-watched the whole season. There are just enough episodes to really *introduce* each of the characters. And I have the sense that the story was just about to get underway when it was cancelled. It's as though JMS put a whole bunch of interesting questions on the table, right before the lights went out.

Nonetheless, I do recommend that B5 fans get and watch the series. First, you'll enjoy seeing that JMS did have an idea of where things were headed. (And he did say in the usenet newsgroups that finding the cure to the plague was only the beginning of the story, which had a multi-year arc.) You'll enjoy a visit to a well-crafted universe you remember. You'll enjoy seeing a new batch of interesting new characters who, darnit, I want to learn what happened to. And you'll have a too-painful example of TNT corporate politics gone wrong, horribly wrong.

If you aren't a fan of Babylon 5, I'd skip Crusade. I think it *does* require knowledge of the B5 universe; otherwise you'd see the flaws and not the best-of-B5. There's plenty of B5 material -- start there, instead.",1134259200,15,2635,4.655913978494624
2157599,3,B00061QJSK,"Well even with no freedom, I think he did a good job with this series. But I just have to comment that what ""I"" think made the show hard to swallow for me was 1. The hokey premise 2. The 50's style spaceship and DEFINITELY 3. The freaked out musical score.

  I mean, I'd be trying to enjoy the show and I was listening to ""Music"" farting and belching in the background!  I am serious!  That alone (and the silly ship model) gave me the feeling that Mr. S. didn't even take this show seriously himself.

  It was EXACTLY like that case with Enterprise, where SO MANY people complained about the opening music (I wanted to as well, but didn't even voice my opinion) and these producers, etc.  get high on their own ego and say to the fans ""This is what you'll get, it's my show"" and unfortunately (OR NOT) spinoffs really are, to some degree, a bigger beast than the individuals involved, they need a certain amount of finesse to be successful and part of that finesse is often sharing some of the same ambiance of the original series.

  Sorry to rant, but, when the orchestrations in B5 are so well placed and ADD to the feeling of a scene, people just get upset and frustrated and disillusioned when they see a falic symbol farting through space, and endure music that Detracts from the emotion...so the show had to go. Sorry.

  But, yeah I really did love the feeling of the ""potential"" of the show.  I hate to have to rate it so low, but I'll defintely buy it.",1129939200,4,1465,4.350553505535055

A proper epilogue for B5, that was truly meant to complete the plots and promises left behind. The visual effects ranged from acceptable to outstanding (the graphic detail of an alien city with Gideon flying in a scooter is simply GREAT), pushing the envelope in Lightwave generated effects at the time. The music was emotive and evocative, and would be a nice addition to any CD collection.

It only took an episode to get past that and then I was hooked.

2157602,5,B00061QJSK,"When TNT saved the day and gave Babylon 5 its fifth year, they also asked JMS about movies and spin offs.  The result of these talks was this show, designed to take place after the movie A CALL TO ARMS.

Set five years after season 5 ended, Earth has been hit by a plague.  While the planet is quarantined, the government sends a crew out on Excalibur, the newly complete ship build with Minbari help.  Their mission is to explore other worlds and hopefully find a cure before the virus destroys all of life on Earth.  The crew is made up of Earth Force personnel and civilians, including an archeologist working for IPX and an alien thief who is the last of her kind.

Unfortunately, we only ever got thirteen episodes of the show due to creative difference between TNT and JMS.  As such, it's really hard to judge.  Compared to Babylon 5, it seems weak.  But then again, the first thirteen episodes of Babylon 5 are the weakest of that series.  Comparing the two sets of thirteen, these come across as stronger.  I have faith in JMS to say that what we have here is the foundation episodes.  Once we got to know the characters, things would have taken off.  Sets and special effects have gotten an improvement as well, even if many of the larger effects come across as cheap by today's standards.  The tone is slightly different, with more of a horror feel to many of the stories and a darker feeling overall.  The music is a bit odd and doesn't seem to fit, often jarring me out of the episode instead of pulling me in like it did on Babylon 5.

This set gives us the thirteen episodes on four DVD's in their original broadcast order.  This isn't the order JMS prefers, and it does cause some continuity issues.  Frankly, I'll take them in any order since the beauty of DVD is I can watch them in the correct order easily.  I was surprised to find the picture full frame.  I don't know if that's all that was available or not, but the picture does seem sharper then the Babylon 5 picture ever was.  Sound is a full surround mix.  Extras on the set are in line with other Babylon 5 releases.  There is a commentary on one episode by members of the cast and crew.  JMS also recorded a commentary on what he wanted the pilot episode to be that gives hints about what would have come had the series continued.  Because Warner Brothers edited it, it won't be on subsequent pressings, so if you want to hear it, get it today.  The final disc has a documentary on the creation of the show (think the intros to seasons on the other sets) and another one on creating the ship itself.

This is a hard show for me to watch.  It begins to get traction just as its ending.  And I really want to know how the show would have continued beyond these episodes.  Still, I'm thrilled to have it to complete my collection.",1126742400,7,2805,4.348747591522158

Crusade is a very creative, thought provoking and entertaining spin off of the award winnind Babylon 5 TV series.  My biggest complaint is that the series was not allowed to be finished.  The 13 eppisode made of the series is just the first part of an exciting adventure that biggins with the quaranteen of earth after a biological weapon was used against it.

It was a most beautiful superposition of D&D into a scifi setting - you have the thief, the wizard, the warrior getting info from a not always forthright magic item, the quest... need I say more?

Unlike the DVD sets for B5 which all are in widescreen, enhanced for Hi-Def sets and are delightful on a 70"" widescreen, the picture quality of the ""Crusade"" DVD set leaves a lot to be desired.

I wish I knew why these are not widescreen and enhanced. Hopefully the widescreen set will be produced for the fans.

These allies of the Shadows have poisoned the planet with a Shadow plague that will wipe out all life once the virus has fully adapted to Human DNA in five years time.  The Excalibur, one of a new battleship design commissioned by Alliance President John Sheridan is pressed into commission to serve as a mobile platform for seeking out information about the plague and how it may be cured.

I really wish this show had gotten the chance to get off the ground properly, there is so much here that begs to be explained.  As with Babylon 5 this show obviously has a five year life built in (though regretably it didn't even make it through one of those years).  If you go digging around you'll even be able to find out a bit more of what JMS had in mind for the show.

In many ways this series reminds me somewhat of traditional Star Trek, whereas Babylon 5 is more similar to Deep Space Nine.  However, of course both shows are quite different, quite good, and not copies of each other.  Okay, with that caveat out of the way I can continue.  We have one ship visiting many ports, discovering new races and cultures, and going someplace new--very Star Trekian.  Now I don't believe this is bad, or truly derivative--I just mention what I see as similar.  One thing that definately jars this is JMS's habit of not including every main character in each episode as Star Trek producers are usually won't to do.  Like Babylon 5 (where there was only one episode in the entire run to feature each then listed main character) you can go several episodes without seeing certain characters.  I like this (and would have liked it more if the series had run for years and it hadn't severely limited our exposure to some characters) it just takes some getting used to.  If you like Star Trek look at this as more good sci-fi--if you don't like Star Trek know this is quite different stuff.

You'll find the serious mixed with the lighthearted.  When talking about episodes I must include the JMS recomended viewing order.  I defied this at first and watched the episode the case said should be first (War Zone)--and it was indeed an introduction, a very traditional pilot.  However, I found out later that it was only produced later when the producers said they didn't like Racing the Night as an introduction.  Furthermore, there were certain elements that didn't fit so well--such as a fistfight and crazy airing order that TNT producers insisted on--so don't blame everything wrong on JMS.  Really this all reminds me of Firefly (which came later) and the trouble Joss Wheedon had with producers at Fox who disliked his excellent pilot and made him redo the second episode Train Job to serve as a new pilot.  However unlike JMS Wheedon was able to make Train Job a new pilot and yet remain as a consistant second episode.  Unfortunately for Crusade, the episode War Zone is somewhat of a continuity orphan, especially if you watch in the JMS order, which I would strongly suggest.  I also enjoy reading the Lurker's Guide to each episode after viewing it.  You'll find this at [...]  Here is the order, the only problems you'll find with it are some out of place uniform changes (that flow in the original airing order) and a couple minor errors (such as Lockley and Gideon meeting for the first time twice ;-)).

Racing the Night

The Needs of Earth

The Memory of War

The Long Road

Visitors from Down the Street

The Well of Forever

Each Night I Dream of Home

Patterns of the Soul

The Path of Sorrows

Ruling from the Tomb

The Rules of the Game

War Zone

Appearances and Other Deceits

Racing the Night is a very good pilot, introducing us to each character in a gradual manner on JMS's terms.  Additionally we join the crew in the middle of their quest and only gradually find out exactly what is happening--it isn't all just thrust upon us.  We not only get a pilot, but a darn good episode.

Visitors from Down the Street is definately an episode in a lighthearted vein, it being a definate mock/tribute/mimic of the X-Files.  However, this time it is aliens believing that humans are interfering in their culture.  :-)  Try to spot as many X-Files references as you can.

Galen is a remarkable character.  First introduced in the Babylon 5 movie A call to Arms he is a technomage.  However, unlike the rest of his brethern he has decided not to retreat from Known Space, but to return to help the crew of the Excalibur fight for humanity.  JMS has called him the traditional fantasy RPG magician of the group.  Really the whole cast is a collection of eccentric, but fun characters.  What little we get to see of them is quite revealing.

A note about special effects.  Please keep in mind that just as on Babylon 5 effects shots are computer generated, and it is noticable.  They aren't horrible, they just aren't as flawless as a big-budget blockbuster.  However, if this is a problem then you shouldn't even be looking at Crusade or B-5.  The stories are what make the show, the special effects just help them along.

The music and shooting style are by design very different from Babylon 5, so don't go in expecting to just see and hear more of the same.

Now there aren't many special features, only four in fact.  You'll get a featurette on the production of the series, and a five minute one on the design of the Excalibur.  Additionall JMS has commentary on Racing the Night, and two of the actors, the director, and writer comment on The Path of Shadows.  The JMS commentary goes into more depth not on just the episode but the series, and what it might have been.

If you enjoyed Babylon 5 then I would definately suggest that you check out this partial series.  You'll get some fun episodes and the chance to see what might have been.  I always enjoy learning more about my favourite universes, and this is no exception!  You get a whole new look at the world of Babylon 5.",1123200000,6,5918,4.554079696394687

2157611,1,B00061QJSK,"Like others who have reviewed this DVD set, I was a very big fan of Babylon 5.  But even saying that I have to admit that the 5th season was the weakest.  Some fans excuse the weaknesses in Crusade (and JMS as well) by saying ""it was going to be good later on.""  But from a story and character point of view, Crusade did not build on the strengths of Babylon 5 and it ultimately continued the downward slide that began with season 5 of B5.

(1) A gloomy concept - humans will be wiped out in 5 years.  Sure JMS now says he would have ""found the cure"" by the end of year 2 but the overall tone of the 1st 13 episode is a downer.  As much as 5b5 of full of war and destruction, there was always an element of hope.

(2) Repetitive story lines - how many worlds killed off by mysterious viruses were we going to visit?  In 13 episodes the stories were already retreads.

(3) Awful music - I like abstract music and the theme was interesting but the music in the battle scenes is cheesy and often sound like an amateur teen on a synthesizer.

(4) Acting - some of the acting was also very amateurish - especially the Fox Mulder/Dana Scully/Cigarette Smoking man wanna-bees?  Why do most aliens have fake English accents and talk as if they are on a bad episode of ""Are you being served?""  And the guy who ""redesigned"" the uniforms was one of the most offensive stereo-type I have seen in modern television.

(5) Costumes - No wonder the network requested changes - the gray-red uniforms look like very bad bellboy uniforms from the 1930s.

On the plus side, Gary Cole made an interesting lead, the ship was nicely designed, the alien woman/thief had strong possibilities and Elizabeth Lockley was far more interesting here than on B5.  Galen was okay but why did he always sound like he was acting on a theater stage.  I guess that was supposed to make everything he said sound more important.",1107475200,36,1889,4.369627507163324
2157612,4,B00061QJSK,"Much has been made of the concept that this show isn't as good as Babylon 5, and it's true, but I found to my surprise that every time I see Crusade I like it a bit more. There weren't enough episodes for the actors to convey a full sense of their characters, but with such strong characters it starts to come through pretty early anyway, and these people are, by and large, very likeable, and the actors are very talented. The effects are good. The music leaves something to be desired, but I can ignore that pretty easily.

One thing that I found helped me a lot in understanding the show is to know that the author intended the episodes to be shown in a specific order, but then the station paying for them insisted that they be re-ordered and that a new pilot episode be created. Because of this, characters occasionally refer to something that hasn't happened yet, and character development seems weird because it no longer progresses in the intended sequence. If you search the web, you can find out what the *intended* episode order was, and some swapping around of discs would allow you to watch them in that order.",1107129600,43,1123,4.532019704433497
2157613,3,B00061QJSK,"I first have to say I loved the babylon 5 series and most of the B5 Movies. The casting for this show is a real mixed bag. Gary Cole as Captain Gideon? He did a decent job of it but I felt he was playing the role too close to the annoying boss in OFFICE SPACE but it is nice to see he can mix it up. After all he was great in those Brady Bunch Movies. Daniel Kim, Peter Woodward and Carrie Dobro all play their roles very well. The doctor played by Marjean Holden has very little performance in the show, David Allen Brooks Character is so so and Tracy Scoggins, reprising her role from B5, is out of place. Not to mention she is listed as starring and is only in 3 episodes. The writing is interesting and the direction is by some B5 Veterans including episodes Directed by Stephen Furst (Vir). With all that said it is still very watchable if you are a B5 fan. But the worst thing in this series is the music. Evan H. Chen's style just isn't for this show. I frequently felt the music would kill an episode. So if you are not a B5 fan this isn't for you. If you are a B5 fan watch for inconsistencies. Oh, and I only saw one of these episodes when it aired, so I had to check it out on dvd. I'm sure some of you will love it, personally I'll watch FARSCAPE or the original B5 shows.",1106784000,14,1284,4.0
2157614,3,B00061QJSK,"Everything I know about ""Crusade"" indicates that it would have grown up into a TV show nearly as spectacular and flawless as B5.  Everything I've read about JMS's plans, everything I know about the cast, and everything that's laid out in these first few episodes points to that inescapable conclusion.

This show was gonna be good.

However... it wasn't good.  It didn't have a chance to get good.  The cast and crew hadn't quite worked out the kinks yet.  The writers hadn't found their groove.  The CG effects weren't *quite* where they needed to be to do landscapes.  The musical scores overreached.  The costuming... sigh.  In short, this half-season of TV was pretty bad.

Hold your horses, though.  Let me repeat: It was *going* to get good.  Every scene, mediocre, bad, or funny, all seemed to say, ""Just wait 'til the end of the season when we're going full-steam.  We'll knock your socks off.""

But the TV executives, short-sighted as they were, killed the show before it got revved up.  Then they added insult to injury by packaging these few episodes in a weak set, skimping on features, and overpricing it.

My advice?  If you don't already love ""Crusade,"" don't buy it.  I firmly believe that it could have become a great show, but there is no greatness evidenced in these episodes, this box set, or this price.  Go watch B5 instead.  At least *those* overpriced sets are worth their weight in gold.",1105228800,63,1412,4.728395061728395

Too bad they didn't get a chance to really tell the story. But if you loved Babylon 5 , then give this a try, just be aware that the story never got finished.

I particularly liked the archeologist. He was arrogant and oblivious and thoroughly fun to watch.

The techno mage was another interesting character, we didn't learn anywhere close to all his secrets I'm thinking.

And it was fun to have a Captain who was a gambler and not so rule bound as many ship captains are portrayed to be especially if they are military.

2157616,4,B00061QJSK,"The aborted TV show ""Crusade"" had a lot going for it. It had breeding (""B5""), a built in audience, support from a major studio and a two outstanding performances by Gary Cole and Peter Woodward. Then TNT realized that when audiences tuned into the old ""B5"" show no one stuck around for their other entertainment (gee, I wonder why!). So they withdrew their support, despite the fact that the full season hadn't been completed and after the expense of redesigning the costumes and sets. The show, beyond the pilot, felt disjointed and for good reason--with half the episodes missing from the first season story arc, it was half a story told with major gaps between some.

Set after the conclusion of the Shadow War, the Drakh an alien race that served the Shadows, contaminates Earth's atmosphere with a deadly virus that will kill all life on Earth within five years. Captain Gideon (Gary Cole), a Techno Mage (one who uses technology in such a way that it appears almost like magic) named Galen (Woodward)and the crew of the Excalibur must search for a cure. Their first stop is a planet where a Drakh spaceship has crashed after a bruising fight with an Earth destroyer. Excalibur is sent to investigate.

While the series could be inconsistent (all the reasons are listed in the next paragraph), it also offered a lot of potential. I have to disagree with those that compare these 13 episodes to the first season of B5 stating that they were of similar quality. No, these 13 episodes, despite gaping narrative holes, are better than the first season of B5. JMS had already set up his universe and it allowed him more time to play with the concepts and characters and that shows from the very first episode of the series. Is it as good as the best two seasons of B5 (seasons 3 & 4)frankly, no but it's a lot better than most of the dreck out there and then some.

Luckily, there's life after death for TV shows. The DVD picture quality is exceptionally good although the series isn't presented in widescreen. The soundtrack has been remastered for 5.1 and we get a documentary on the show as well a featurette on the design of the Excalibur. Two audio commentaries are included one featuring two of the actors from the show (Peter Woodward is one of them), director Janet Greek and writer Fiona Avery. Then we JMS' commentary track which, from all accounts, was edited after the fact to prevent him from venting his feelings about the poor way that TNT handled the show.

The DVDs are priced a bit high considering what you get but the presentation is handsome. You get all thirteen episodes and the extras spread over four discs with brief descriptions of each episode, writer/director and guest cast on the flaps of the accordian style DVD holder. Hopefully sales will be good enough to convince Warner Brothers not to recast the B5 movie with other actors (JMS and Babylonian Productions are fighting against it). Since its currently in preproduction, it's hard to say who will win out on this one. Hopefully, Warner will see the response that Sci-Fi (when Sci-Fi cancelled ""Farscape"" it was as boneheaded as TNT's decision to cancel this show without giving it a chance) got when they aired the ""Farscape"" concluding movie and allow the production to move forward with the original cast.

I must state though, that I really enjoyed this whole set, and  watched many episodes twice (later on). They are infinitely better than B5, even with the occasional reversion to the same Boring Banter between captains; constantly Talking and COMPLAINING. The weight, the difficulties, the bla bla bla. That's all they ever give to Tracy Scoggins (in the Crusade series), lines about how hard it is to be a captain. They even dedicated a whole episode to Tracy Complaining About The Universe, so Gideon boinks her. Most of the characters are solid and interesting, especially Galen. There is alot of entertainment here, even if you hated B5 as I did. But you must see the Pilot episode to appreciate CRUSADE.

Episodes meant to flesh out the characters and storyline including the uniform color changes were never filmed. Unreleased scripts gave us a brief glimpse of what was to come.

""I Dream Of Home"" was the best he could do to make some kind of closure.  The real reason for TNT-Atlanta's interference was after their five year audience study they found out that B5 did not bring in more viewers while their core audience left when B5 came on. So to get out of it's contract so it could use the money to buy another program TNT-Atlanta started making all kinds of unreasonable demands. JMS said he will discuss this in the commentary. It should also be noted that TNT-LA had always been supportive of JMS but it was TNT-Atlanta that had the final say.  Also, there was NO FINALE made. The show was dead months before it aired. Some people continue to review this thing like it was cancelled AFTER broadcast. Anyway, by buying the DVDs you send a message to WB that you want more B5. That's how all these DVDs got released in the first place. We bought that cheapy Gathering/In The Beginning DVD. Lastly, as others have noted, our buying the DVDs has resulted in new B5 stuff on the way, including maybe something to do with the Crusade storylines.",1102032000,34,1596,4.554006968641115
2157633,3,B00061QJSK,"Aside from TNT's meddling, this series came off to a pretty good start, but it had it's own problems and cliches (a thief with cat-like eyes/agility anyone?) to overcome.

Sound a bit like Babylon 5, doesn't it? Given another season or two (free from meddling), it probably would've become another semi-classic TV series that never got quite enough attention (just like Babylon 5). Certainly enough forward-looking plotlines were laid down, and by the end, looked to finally have found its stride. It's a shame that the series will never be finished. Hopefully, at some point, another B5 movie (better than Legend of the Rangers, hopefully) or book series finishing off this story will come out.",1101600000,10,695,5.043478260869565
2157634,4,B00061QJSK,"There may be three or four of you who didn't watch all of Babylon 5, and so don't understand all the mysterious aliens so wonderfully set forth in this unique universe.  Forthwith, a primer:

Earth Alliance:  military forces of a sometimes uneasy ""one world"" government, an interesting blend of Army, Navy, and Air Force drawing from all nations (and, interestingly, from colonies like Mars, Io, and others).  Basically, us Humans.

Minbari:  mysterious elder race that nearly wiped out the human race before discovering we are the ""other half"" of their souls.  Together, the two races kicked the ancient races out of the galaxy and formed the Interstellar Alliance from the former League of Nonaligned Worlds.  Empire building ensues.

Rangers: part Minbari, part Human (and soon from other IA races) elite forces.  They don't create the peace, they just help enforce it.  They go where no one else will; when they guard the bridge, none shall pass -- you get the idea.

Vorlons:  mysterious elder race (hmm, sounds vaguely familiar) that acted as a guide for the younger races until we basically outgrew their help.  They're big into Order. Thousands of years more advanced than us, their technology is the only real bulwark against the Shadows.

Shadows: mysterious elder race (sheesh) that are agents of Chaos.  After a climactic battle, they leave our galaxy along with the Vorlons and the remaining First Ones (mysterious elder--oh, never mind), leaving their former servants in the lurch, holding some really nasty leftover technology.

Drakh: former thralls of the Shadows, they learned well at the (insectoid) knees of their former masters.  After causing some serious trouble at the outskirts of the IA, they come after Earth to settle the score.  After their leftover Shadow toy fails, they dump a biogenetic plague on Earth on the way out.  Hey, not fair!

Vastly over-simplified, that's the universe Crusade happens in.  The Excalibur, only surviving prototype of a new melding of Human, Minbari, and Vorlon technologies, is turned into a research and exploration vessel, and sent off to find a cure with the help of the Rangers.  We get a Captain who's an inveterate gambler (in more than one sense), a telepathic first officer, a Techno-Mage (one who uses technology to simulate magic), an eccentric, asocial genius (have to have one of those), a noble doctor bravely searching for the cure, an alien Thief (supposedly the last survivor of another race destroyed by the Drakh -- or is she?), and other characters you'll love.

Others have waxed eloquest about the bottom-feeding mouth-breathers at TNT and their moral/ethical shortcomings (beyond recto-cranial inversion -- child molesters look down upon these bozos), so I won't waste your time further.  If you loved B5 and feel the need to pick up every piece of video ever produced in that universe, this would be a wonderful purchase.  If you never got the chance to see it on TNT (I haven't been back on that channel since the departure of B5), and missed it on the Sci-Fi Channel, this would be a convenient way to pick up the whole shooting match at once.  Overlooking the bizarre changes in costuming, the sometimes uneven effects, and the simple fact there were only 13 shows made, this show could be a primer on how to do thought-provoking drama while telling a thumping good story at the same time.  Recommended at the price.",1101513600,19,3402,4.9734513274336285
2157635,5,B00061QJSK,"In 1999, the creator of the sci-fi TV series ""Babylon 5"", J. Michael Straczynski, produced a 2-hour made-for-TV film entitled ""Babylon 5: A Call To Arms"".  The premise of ""Babylon 5: A Call To Arms"" was that several years following the Shadow War, which was part of the plot of the original ""Babylon 5"" TV series (1994-1998), allies of the departed Shadow race decide to avenge the destruction of the Shadow home world known as Z'ha'dum (pronounced Za'hadoom).  Captain Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) becomes aware that Earth is threatened by an imminent attack from the former Shadow allies lead by the reptilian race known as the Drakh, who intend to use a powerful Shadow ""planet-killer"" to destroy Earth.  Captain Sheridan gathers what forces he can to defend Earth, including the use of two prototype warships that utilize Vorlon technology.  One of the prototype warships is destroyed during the attack upon the ""planet-killer"" above Earth, but the Drakh resort to a biological weapon instead that unleashes a deadly virus upon the entire population of Earth.  With few people not infected, Earth decides to use its only remaining Vorlon-inspired warship, named Excalibur, to search for a cure before the virus completely destroys all life on Earth within 5 years.  Hence, the short-lived TV series ""Crusade"" was born in 1999, with the intent of being a 5-year long series about the Excalibur crew's search for the cure.  Unfortunately, creative conflicts between TNT (that TV channel that originally aired the series) and J. Michael Straczynski lead to show's premature cancellation after only 13 episodes.  Also, no other channel had the opportunity of picking up the series in spite of the fact that scripts for three more episodes had been written, but were never filmed.

Starring in the ""Crusade"" were Gary Cole as Captain Matthew Gideon, Daniel Dae Kim as John Matheson, David Allen Brooks as Max Eilerson, Peter Woodward as the techno-mage Galen, Marjean Holden as Dr. Sarah Chambers and Carrie Dobro as the alien Dureena Nafeel, who was the only cast member from ""Babylon 5: A Call To Arms"" to have a regular role in ""Crusade"".  Sadly, with only 13 episodes, ""Crusade"" never really had the opportunity to develop into a show of the same caliber as the original ""Babylon 5"".  However, the same wonderful special effects and character development did have a chance to take shape, especially with the mysterious techno-mage Galen.  In order, the 13 hour-long episodes and their original airdates on TNT were as follows:

1. ""War Zone"" (6/9/1999)

2. ""The Long Road"" (6/16/1999)

3. ""The Well of Forever"" (6/23/1999)

4. ""The Path of Sorrows"" (6/30/1999)

5. ""Patterns of the Soul"" (7/7/1999)

6. ""Ruling from the Tomb"" (7/14/1999)

7. ""The Rules of the Game"" (7/21/1999)

8. ""Appearances and Other Deceits"" (7/28/1999)

9. ""Racing the Night"" (8/4/1999)

10. ""The Memory of War"" (8/11/1999)

11. ""The Needs of Earth"" (8/18/1999)

12. ""Visitors from Down the Street"" (8/25/1999)

13. ""Each Night I Dream of Home"" (9/1/1999)

Of these 13 episodes, the best were ""The Path of Sorrows"", ""Racing the Night"", ""The Memory of War"" and ""Visitors from Down the Street"".  Overall, I rate the short-lived sci-fi TV series ""Crusade"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  It is truly sad that these 13 episodes are all that exist for what could have been a truly wonderful 5-year TV series.",1101254400,49,3370,5.034296028880866

****************************************

While I essentially agree with what others have said about Crusade being a great series that showed a lot of promise, the following info. should be presented:

1. TNT cancelled Crusade months before it was even aired. Hence Crusade was NOT cancelled because of Crusade's ratings numbers, but because TNT had found out that ""Babylon 5"" itself was a bad fit for their core audience.  Crusade's cancellation had little or nothing to do with Crusade itself.  It just had the misfortune to start out on the WRONG channel, a sci-fi unfriendly channel.

2. In the ""A Call to Arms"" (B5 Movie Collection DVD Set), JMS mentions that the plague was a hook (Earth in jeopardy) that Warner Brothers and TNT felt that the Crusade series needed to start off with.  The plague was something that they needed to get INTO the Crusade storyline (politically, with what the Shadows left behind, and the conspiracy back on Earth, Galen and the Technomage connection to Shadowtech that's expounded upon in the Technomage trilogy of novels, etc.).

****************************************

""Good Show and I Will DEFINITELY Buy It."" (added Dec. 2, 2004)

I will buy it BECAUSE I enjoyed the episodes that WERE produced (ditto for Brimstone, Strange Luck, The Ellen Show, Special Unit 2, Firefly, Keen Eddie, Wonderfalls, Boomtown, The Tick, etc.).  I already have Firefly and The Tick, will be buying Keen Eddie, Wonderfalls, and Boomtown, shortly, and will buy the rest when they become available.

I will buy it BECAUSE I want to show support for a good show that was mishandled and prematurely cancelled (just like most of the other shows listed above.).

I will also buy it because there is a chance that the Crusade story will be continued (theatrical release, novels, etc.).

Q&A session

Room 120 - Fans begin gathering and taking their places in traditional school desks. Some of us haven't seen the like for...a long time. Before us is a perfectly clean blackboard. While we wait for JMS, somebody (okay, I did it) writes in large letters "" MR. STRACZYNSKI"" and below it, ""T M o S 101""

3:00 PM. JMS arrives and, without a word, goes to the board and erases the ""TMOS 101"" part amid much laughter.
....
Audience: Any (plans?) to address the Crusade story?

JMS: Uh....(gestures toward the erased blackboard) Other questions.

....

Audience: Out of all your cancelled projects, which one would you like to resume first?

JMS: There's only been a couple. (laughter) He's being mean to me! Umm...Crusade. That's the obvious choice because that one was cut short...it was shot in it's cradle by unfair means and that pisses me off. So I will fix that one way or the other.

And given what JMS said immediately above, it's likely that at least some of the upcoming new novels...

... published by Del Rey, I'd go for the new novels in a heartbeat.

Without the Crusade DVD set, you'll be missing the first part of the Crusade story. I wouldn't buy a novel with the FRONT 50 pages missing.  Also, with the television performances to draw upon, I can better ""see"" the story unfold in a novel as I read it.  I enjoyed the last three trilogies of novels more, for that very reason.

With all of the above in mind, I will DEFINITELY be buying the Crusade DVD Set.

FINALLY, 4:3 (FULL FRAME) **AS IT SHOULD BE**. (added Dec. 17, 2004)

Unlike all of the Babylon 5 series, this DVD set is not widescreen - WHEW! FINALLY, they do the RIGHT thing!!!  The CGI, like Babylon 5's CGI was only rendered 4:3, SO, by being full frame (4:3) instead of widescreen 16:9, what we get with the Crusade set is 100% of the CGI, not top & bottom cropped and enlarged CGI, with the artifacts the cropping and enlarging introduces.  I WISH they'd have done the Babylon 5 Season Sets this way.

With the Crusade DVDs, they FINALLY did the RIGHT thing, and didn't crop every frame that had any amount of CGI in it (e.g. even a monitor being seen in the frame).

KoshN",1101254400,14,5390,4.925802879291251
2157637,5,B00061QJSK,"Crusade's production was launched almost immediately after the conclusion of the Babylon 5 series. The made-for-TV movie A Call to Arms was a bridge between the two series.

The setup: The Shadows have left the galaxy, the Clark regime has been taken out and the Telepath War is over. Earth Alliance and the Interstellar Alliance, now seemingly getting a chance to breathe, are attacked by the Drakh, a species the Shadows used as servants. The Drakh have Shadow technology, giving them an edge in their war against those that drove their masters from the known galaxy. The Alliance defeats them in a battle above Earth, but in a final act of spite, the Drakh dispense a plague into Earth's atmosphere. Scientists estimate that Earth's population has five years to live. Mathew Gideon, a young Earth Alliance officer, is chosen to command the Excalibur -- a brand new starship fusing human, Minbari and Vorlon technology -- and sent to find a cure out among the stars. Along the way, he will clash with the Drakh and his own government and he will constantly be shadowed by a mysterious techno-mage, Galen.

Crusade was a good show with the potential to be great. What a lot of people don't know is that the cure would have been found within two seasons, and the show would have moved on to deeper, darker issues, if one can imagine something darker than Earth's population dying off.

It is incredulous to suggest that the music killed this show, as the reaction was truly a mixed bag, and it took nothing away from the character interactions. Just the same, visits to Babylon 5 and Earth did not kill the show, as the show really wasn't about the plague. As mentioned before, it would have been cured pretty quickly. What killed the show was that fact that TNT execs did not like the numbers it was doing, despite their refusal to give it a decent time slot, among other things. JMS will reveal everything in a tell-all interview included in the DVD set. His comments are so controversial that WB Home Video was wary about letting them go on the DVD. JMS demanded that they be included.

Look for a possible mention of JMS' latest Babylon 5 project, The Memory of Shadows, on the set.

Crusade is often compared to the cult anime show Star Blazers, the first season of which featured a sickened Earth and a spaceship called the Argo sent to pick up a cure from a distant planet.",1100390400,25,2380,4.630331753554502
2157638,3,B00061QJSK,"Crusade is an interesting show that is very well cast,but suffers from some self indulgent producing that produced some very bad decisions. JMS decided to experiment with some strange and boring music that really didn't fit the show. Ratings had started well and then dropped badly because it is hard to concentrate on the show with such dreadful music.

To answer reviewer ""star fire rain"" who disagrees with me about the reasons for cancellation,this show was cancelled due to TNT executives feeling that JMS had not given them what he had promised and a big factor in that is the very lame music. It just doesn't work. Just when they get a dramatic scene,it is ruined by the most lame and lifeless music in the history of television.

When the show did air,JMS thought that he could interest someone else(like the Sci-Fi Channel)in taking up the show,but the ratings dropped badly and that chance was gone(again,the lame,flat and very boring music was a factor).
Some Crusade fans(like sfr),that think that JMS can do no wrong,may disagree with this but the fact is that the audience was initially there and left. Season one was not the time to experiment and the music was absolutely awful.

The special effects vary from reasonable to poor,but the cast are fantastic and the story setup is good. Any fans that blame TNT for the demise of Crusade should remember that they financed the 13 episodes of Crusade,the entire fifth season of Babylon 5,four telemovies and even gave JMS $150,000 to re-edit the B5 pilot. To give such money to re-edit a pilot is unprecedented and shows that he initially had their support.
TNT backed Babylon 5 and Crusade to the tune of well over US$40 million and the turning point came when JMS made the mistake of replacing Babylon 5's eccellent composer with a disastrous and musically very different new composer. The result was that Crusade did not match Babylon 5's ratings.

JMS then went to the Sci-Fi channel that financed one single episode of his new B5 Rangers show,so by that comparison TNT didn't do so badly. Fans should remember that no-one else wanted Crusade.",1100217600,3,2109,4.833795013850415
