8359268,4,B002ABRN6Q,"This was probably made around the time that Spielberg's ""Amistad"" arrived in theaters.  The work does say there were at least 150 documented riots on slave ships, but Amistad represents the only time that Africans were sent back to Africa.  I had some concerns that showing a story with a positive outcome would overly sugarcoat the issue.  However, there is enough info about the slave trade period to let viewers know that it was a tragedy but not to bum them out thoroughly.
The work had so much useful information.  It stated that Amistad could be taken over because the crew was small and overly confident.  The work said usually crews were larger and they very carefully watched the future slaves.  This is why few of the slaves could jump overboard.  The work said there were 39,000 voyages in the triangle trade.  The work stated that 15 to 20% of slaves died on ships, but more died reaching the coasts of Africa where they were intended to board slave boats.  The work does not fail to mention that most slaves came from Africans capturing other Africans.  The work stated that when a captain threw 137 Africans overboard to collect the insurance money is when the Abolitionist movement in the UK and the US really got rolling.  Something that stands out is that the US and UK agreed to stop importing slaves by the time Cinque was forced onto a ship heading for Cuba.  He and his peers were not freed just because Westerners had big hearts; it was the unique times which opened the door for these Africans to be considered more than just property.
Unlike the History Channel, this Discovery Channel documentary had strong reenactments, rather than cheesy stuff.  The work interviews experts of different races, genders, and possibly nationalities.  More famous people than Cinque came up.  They mention a freed man named Equiano who helped to end the slave trade in the UK.  They mention that the author of ""Amazing Grace"" was once a slave trader.  At the time that Cinque's case reached the Supreme Court, most of the Court members were slaveholders.
The work mentions that African women were raped on these boats.  The work shows adult women's breasts, which I found realistic but brave.
This would be a wonderful documentary, to this day, to show in high school and junior high history classes.  Alfre Woodard did a commendable job as narrator.  (I saw Debbie Allen host a doc on Cinque that I thought was cheesier.)  The viewer does not have to have seen the ""Amistad"" film to gain from this work.",1435881600,,2512,4.728735632183908
