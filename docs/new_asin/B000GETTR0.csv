8131203,1,B000GETTR0,"There is no way to say it nicely, this DVD is utter rubbish. The sound quality is so poor I've have had to turn up the volume on my TV to maximum to hear it and even then the guitar sounds are difficult to hear. My TV is a new widescreen model with HIFI speakers. For a DVD that is supposed to be about Jazz this is completely unacceptable.",1155254400,9,340,3.9420289855072466
