8765243,2,B01HEBBW9A,"I was expecting a narrator read version of the books, not a recording of a performance including sound effects. I did not listen to the full first cd as it was difficult to decipher the voices over background.",1484956800,,209,4.526315789473684
8765244,1,B01HEBBW9A,This is an abridged copy which is not stated anywhere in the description.,1483574400,,73,4.6923076923076925
8765245,3,B01HEBBW9A,I love this trilogy but on this cd there are loud unnecessarily noises and the sound isn't great.  I admit I have trouble understanding British accents and am hard of hearing so I gave this an extra star due to my shortcomings.  I did enjoy the cd even with all the problems I had understanding the dialogue.,1473033600,,308,4.385964912280702
