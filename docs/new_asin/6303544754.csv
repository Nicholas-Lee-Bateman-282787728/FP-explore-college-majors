7850163,3,6303544754,"First of all, the episodes on this volume were great. It's the quality that upsets me. The first episode (""Mork's First Christmas"") was in pretty good condition, but the second episode (""Mork Goes Erk"") was in REALLY bad condition! I'd rather get these episodes from someone who taped them off Nick at Nite or from the Canadian Comedy Channel.",1009238400,4,343,4.830508474576271
7850164,5,6303544754,"Williams is a comic genius. He may own an Oscar for Good Will Hunting, but Mork is still by far his best work. Mork and Mindy perfectly captures the raw, unpredictable and exceptional comic talent which is purely Williams' own. The two episodes on this video are two of the best episodes from all four years of this heart-warming, side-splitting and award-winning comedy. I would strongly reccommend this video, and all other three volumes, to anyone who likes to laugh. It's one of the best purchases I have made in a long time!",1006300800,3,529,4.698924731182796
