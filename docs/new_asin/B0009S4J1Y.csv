I had found a free copy online but the transfer was so bad wanted to find a DVD of it.  And found this.  Oops.  The transfer is just as bad as online.  And the movie is not as good as I had remembered it.  BUT...what really upset me was if I was a parent getting and showing this to my kids I would be LIVID.  The first thing you see is the previews.  Canibal Taboo is the first one..fully of nudity, blood and other scenes NOT suitable for children.  What were they thinking???  Save your money and your aggravation...do not purchase.",1468627200,,658,4.142857142857143

8066058,2,B0009S4J1Y,"I love the movie, but the transfer sucks donkey balls. The disc even stops playing at a certain point and has to be restarted. Good thing it was cheap! The only reason I bought this is it was the only one I could find anywhere.",1357084800,,227,4.066666666666666

8066060,5,B0009S4J1Y,"I can answer the question as to why it's hard to purchase a good copy of this film. It was a foreign film, and a low budget if that. However, don't let this discourage you. It's a really good movie. I remember the first time watching this in 1985, and I'm like Dean Jones is in an adult movie? Well he does rather well in this film for being on a break from Disney movies. The plot is also good as they found an ancedote for the common cold, but there is one catch....it makes you invisible. I remember the beginning of the film it's where Jones's character gets a phone call from the doctor who was helping him tells him the ancedote made him invisible, and then it goes into the opening credits. That seems to have been omitted when it was released on VHS in the states however, because I used to have this on VHS. Anyway back to the movie. There seems to be a problem with this ancedote as other parties want to get their hands on it, and use it for their own selfish motives. There are some memorable scenes like the resturant scene when Jones's character is already invisible, and he creates trouble for a romantic rival. You see there's this woman named Irene that he works with, and is secretly in love with, but then there's Harold who treats Irene like property. Well Jones decides to create trouble for Harold by making him do some social miscues such as slurping of his soup, or pulling his chair away from him, and making him fall on the floor. Just your simple pratfalls of slapstick comedy, but it's still good to watch.",1247702400,4,1534,4.348432055749129

there is no digital enhancement and you might be dissapointed on the quality too,however this a hard movie to find and true fan will still enjoy it. but I hope someday they realease a proper version of the film in widescreen also seem like the pictue is too crowded at times,if you like Dean Jones most will order it.",1153872000,2,381,4.148648648648648
