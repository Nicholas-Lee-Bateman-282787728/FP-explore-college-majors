4430269,5,B004MKDH0Y,"Somewhere in Tokyo, a sadistic self-mutilation S&M obsessed criminal named Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano) with his goons search for the missing boss Anjo who has three million yen. An ex-cop named Jiji (Shin'Ya Tsukamoto) wants to take down the yakuza as does a cry-baby Daredevil-esque avenger named Ichi (Nao Ohmori) who has sharp as hell blade shoes that he uses to slice bad people, rapists and murderers into bloody sushi as he goes after Kakihara's men.

Ultraviolent, sadistic and hilarious 2001 Japanese/Hong Kong/South Korean horror-action-comedy-thriller import is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. Based on a graphic Japanese manga comic, this one is directed by infamous Japanese shockster director Takashi Miike who is known for sadistic films like Audition. This one offers great acting from the cast especially from Tadanobu who steals the show with his glasglow-smiled faced cretin who i believe influenced Nolan for the Joker for The Dark Knight. The gore effects are quite realistic at times despite some is done by CGI and there are some painful moments of torture including to a nipple to all the way to cooking oil to even rape, despite all that there are good laughs in it as it's also a dark comedy. This film has became one of the biggest cult movies in recent memory and the one that started modern torture porn that influenced many directors including Eli Roth who is a big fan of this movie for his Hostel movies. Most recommended for horror fans, comic book movie fans and foreign film fans but not for the politically correct or faint of heart.

The Tokyo Shock Blu-Ray here in the US/Canada offers good picture and very good sound to it, the extras are terrific such as interviews, audio commentary with the creator of the manga Hideo Yamato and Takashi Miike in subtitles, photo gallery, trailer,  Eli Roth on Ichi feature, the making of Ichi The Killer featurette and Cult of Ichi featurette.",1315872000,2,1935,4.91131498470948

8436064,5,B004MKDH0Y,"This is truly a unique piece by Takashi Miike, thirty seconds in and the story feels like you're on an acid trip from another country. I love how the good guy is, accidentally the worst super hero ever, and causing as much damage as the bad guys. I will never forget even 16yrs after I saw this initially, the open credits, how they rise from a glob of....",1490313600,,356,4.25
8436065,3,B004MKDH0Y,"A little odd. Very much like a comic book, which is to be expected since it is (as I understand) based off of a manga. Not my favorite movie, but also not bad. Definitely good if you want an alternative action film, and a good bit of philosophical commentary within.",1485388800,,266,4.34

8436071,4,B004MKDH0Y,"The mysterious Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto) uses mental manipulation to control the sadomasochistic superman Ichi (Nao Omori), using him to throw the local yakuza into chaos.  The yakuza has its own sadomasochistic enforcer, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), and the two are soon on a collision course.

Featuring a plethora of bizarre touches and WTF moments, Takashi Miike directs with a real flair and freedom that infuses a sense of joy into his graphic, wince-inducing film.  In the hands of another director, this would probably be a pretty grim and gloomy little film, but Miike has the ability to find the fun in this type of material.",1464998400,,632,5.0576923076923075
