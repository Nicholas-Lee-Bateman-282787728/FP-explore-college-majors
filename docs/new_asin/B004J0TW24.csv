8431487,3,B004J0TW24,"A pretty standard indie horror flick with a nice little twist at the end. The audio is pretty bad in some places but not enough to ruin the movie. Some characters just seem to appear and disappear. Not sure what their roles were supposed to be. Had some decent kills and blood though which, if we're being honest, is why we watch these movies to begin with.",1508716800,,357,4.343283582089552
8431488,5,B004J0TW24,"sindy faraguna IS horror genre's new scream queen. debbie rochon has been in too many horror remakes and lynnea quigley is mostly retired.

bleeding lady aka star vehicle reminds me of, if rebecca schaeffer from my sister sam murder had been different, up-close and more personal rather than private(this is just what came to mind to me, some would say if the bodyguard was a horror film, others may say a mock of the 1976 film deliverance). the fact sindy faraguna is a natural blonde whom became a redhead, looks bettter now. i also love the fact all the actors in this film are also horror buffs makes this film work even more.",1454025600,,630,4.575221238938053
