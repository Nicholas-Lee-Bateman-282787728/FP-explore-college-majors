2553406,5,B000F6ZDX8,"Crazy to see 1 stars here. Brilliant defence of God. People fail to realise Gods omnipotence doesn't mean he is all powerful in the sense that he can make the illogical logical. He cannot make 2+2=5 with the laws we have in this universe. If he could do anything illogical then evil and God could coexist anyway?
As an Arminian free will is key to my theology. I don't have a problem with evil and suffering as I believe in the freedom God has given us anyway. Sad to see such low review scores.",1406764800,3,495,4.276595744680851
2553407,1,B000F6ZDX8,"When I received the DVD it appeared in new condition but unfortunately my schedule did not allow me to view within the return time frame. When I finally did play it the DVD WAS VERY PROBLEMATIC.  JUST THE TITLE  SCREEN CAME UP,THAT IT.  ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THE ALL IMPORTANT PLAY DID NOT WORK. SO BASICALLY I PAID FOR A DVD  I COULD NOT WATCH. AT ALL.",1403740800,,361,4.343283582089552
2553408,5,B000F6ZDX8,"As a person who watches tons of lectures and documentaries, this was an excellent lecture exposing the opinions of an atheist/physicist, 2 Christians, and an atheist who believes in the existence of objective values. Ravi is a great speaker and accurately presents the psychology of the vast majority of Christians. Dr. Craig (I'm not sure if that's how you spell his name) posed an interesting argument about the inability for evolutionary bio to provide an ontology of objective moral values (whether they are real or not). I personally felt as though the atheist/physicist was rhetorically weak and unsophisticated in his delivery of what he knows and believes. That is my only issue with this lecture it seems a bit unbalanced in its representation of a equally qualified & rhetorically experienced naturalist/atheist voice and perspective. But this is Ravi's show/lecture so it is what it is. Jitendra Mohanty raised a good point about the ability to embrace the existence of objective moral values but not accept its source which he mentions is stated by Kant. I will need to look into this. I also believe Mohanty contributed the most unique and unheard of perspective particularly with regard to the objectivity of modern moral values being stronger than the objectivity of scientific theories. Wow, that's just a very bold statement and when you think of it and apply what you know about experimental designs and what these designs in the end provide which are p-values and other measures of confidence preferentially constructed by man, Jitendra Mohanty's statement ends up making a whole lot of sense",1387756800,4,1611,5.129277566539924
2553409,1,B000F6ZDX8,"The Problem of Evil is an insurmountable one for Christians (and all other theists who believe in a perfectly loving, all-powerful and all-knowing god). There have been intense and motivated efforts over the past two millennia to defend such a position rationally, and they have all failed. Miserably. Utterly. And in many cases, dishonestly.

Some approached involve invoking an unknown ""greater good"" defense (which throws god's omnipotence under the bus. An omnipotent deity could simply actualise a desired goal without needing to use suffering as a ""middle man""). Attempts to shift the problem by asserting that human happiness is not the goal of life (but knowing god is) removes the omnibenevolence and omnipotence of god (if you love someone, you don't want them to suffer. It really is that simple).

Here, Zacharias takes the old canard of free will. Unfortunately, free will is meaningless unless everyone has an equal amount of it. This is undeniably NOT the case. Not everyone is given the same lifespan, physical strength, mental acuity, political clout, financial resources, and so on. Zacharias is pontificating from the luxurious confines of his residence, funded by conveniently gullible sheep. This has certainly damaged his ability to empathise with the billions who live on less than a dollar each day. And the thousands who starve to death every time the Earth completes a full rotation.

Zacharias also, perhaps unwittingly, advocates a social Darwinism in which the rich and physically powerful are able to murder, rape and steal from weaker individuals (and are therefore less able to exercise their own free will to prevent their own suffering). Zacharias worships a cosmic pedophile who revels in granting freedom to abhorrent individuals while getting his jollies from seeing the most vulnerable suffer and die in agony (only to get thrown into even more torture in the Christian vision of hell).

Lastly, a loving god would take away free will from those who would willingly surrender it in return for a life without suffering. Funnily enough, Zacharias seems to believe in a heaven without suffering but with all the bells and whistles of freedom. So why not create that universe from the get-go and stick with it? Why create a universe with even the possibility of corruption? It certainly is not something a perfect god would do. Then again, a perfect god would not blackmail beings he supposedly loves for eternal worship.",1366761600,,2455,5.145363408521304
2553410,5,B000F6ZDX8,"Ravi Zacharias provides accuracy for the Christian faith in explaining the meaning of suffering in our world. He upholds the Christian faith and explains the purpose of suffering as it is presented in juxtaposition by believers of non-Christian world-views. For those finding themselves empty and lost in their travails, this scholarly debate may have you considering your purpose in a way you previously had not.",1360454400,7,413,5.369230769230769

8118146,5,B000F6ZDX8,The presentation and debate was very enlightening to me. I learned much more in a short time from the participants about their personsl persuasions and conclusions than I ever could have from reading the work of just one of them. I enjoyed the give and take among them. Dr. Zacharias was especially impressive.,1455580800,,310,4.867924528301887
