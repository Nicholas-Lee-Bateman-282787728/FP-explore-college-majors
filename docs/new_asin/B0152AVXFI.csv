7427142,5,B0152AVXFI,I was at Jeffs NBC show taping and laughed so hard!  Controlled Chaos was my favorite but I think this one might be my new favorite! Can't wait to see the extended version on DVD.,1442534400,,179,4.114285714285714

7427149,5,B0152AVXFI,Same stuff but always funny.  New character added and its called Unhinged for a reason. Dunham is too likeable not to be liked.,1520467200,,127,4.521739130434782
7427150,5,B0152AVXFI,"I just love Jeff Dunham.  His best video is insanity, but this one was worth watching",1520467200,,85,4.3125
7427151,4,B0152AVXFI,"After being very disappointed with ""Minding the Monsters,"" I was leery about buying Jeff Dunham's latest iteration of the continuing saga of a man and his, uh, dolls.  So I watched it on cable first, and while I didn't like this one as much as ""Spark of Insanity"" or ""Controlled Chaos"" (by far my favorite) what I saw is Jeff getting back to the comedy and character interaction that put him on the map in the first place.  Once again, Jeff finds a way to employ physical humor with his characters and it works.  While I agree with the reviewers who say he should have spent more time with Walter and Peanut, I actually thought the middle bit where he's doing a ""commercial"" for the Jeff Dunham ventriloquist dummy was freaking hilarious!  I also have to agree with those who say putting Achmed last doesn't work as well as finishing off with Peanut (and what ever happened to Jose Jalapeno on a stick?).  That's my biggest gripe about the show.  But again, what made this one worth it for me was seeing Jeff putting on a show that contained much more thought and effort than ""Minding the Monsters"" (which I think was largely an uninspired attempt by Jeff to make money off his fame while taking too many opportunities to bash his ex-wife).  Jeff gets back to his roots with this one.  If you're a Jeff Dunham fan, you'll want this one in your collection.",1520208000,,1355,4.502040816326531

7427178,3,B0152AVXFI,"We love Jeff Dunham and his ventriloquism and puppets.
This stand-up DVD was not one of his good ones.
It seemed more of a promotional about him selling a little Jeff.
That seem to be pretty much the funniest part of the DVD unfortunately.",1512777600,,239,4.454545454545454

7427185,3,B0152AVXFI,"Act is getting a little predictable/stale, but comedy is hard and very very subjective. Still it was a nice complement to the available you tube stuff. Intro by Universal was too long, but my cat was mesmerized. Credits at the end were way too long. Extra features were pretty awful unless you like rap mixed with a rapid sampling of snapshots from the performance. Reminded me of disco.",1505174400,,387,4.705882352941177

7427212,5,B0152AVXFI,"I love this tape. The only thing I wish  was that there was more. I find Jeff's humor has a wide range and the bits with Walter remind me of some of the old men I have met. Akmen (?) the Terrorist has some great bits as well.  You can always get a taste of Jeff Dunham by going to his site. Then come back and pick up a couple of his CD's. This particular CD has the PG and the R rated copy of his complete show. It is nice to have the choice. Jeff is an outstanding ventriloquist so much so, you actually feel he is talking over himself in many spots. Love it. I bought this to show my dad and I was so happy I did because he enjoyed it immensely.",1493510400,3,648,3.7925925925925927

7427303,3,B0152AVXFI,"Possible spoilers:  Didn't like this one as much as his other DVDs.  It seems jaded and the characters rely more on raunchy humor and bad language than before.  I'm all for raunchy comedy but not from this cast.  That is not why I like Jeff Dunham and his ""assistants"".  I don't like Little Jeff at all. He's irritating and antagonistic for no reason although the chasing routine was unexpected.  Don't care for the continued disparagement of wives - a little bit is great, an entire show around it, not so much.  Walter used to have much more dimension - this show was just complaining about his wife.  I can get that at work. I am not sure if the falling apart of the props was intentional or not but combined with throwing another character and messing up one of the jokes with Bubba Jay, it just appears sloppy - as if Jeff doesn't care about his routine anymore.  I would have still watched the DVD but I would have waited for Netflix rather than buying it on Amazon Prime.",1478995200,2,978,4.418994413407821

7427524,3,B0152AVXFI,"Definitely not his best work.  Although overall is it okay, there's just some things in it that are so ""WTF!""  First, in the middle he gets out his little jeff dummy doll and becomes a seller for his product.  I'm sorry, I'm here to watch you entertain, not try to get me to purchase your product.  If I wanted to view a shopping program, I'd have watched the Home Shopping Network on television.  (Some parts are funny though!)  Second, Achmed falls apart.  So we never get to see the finishing act as Jeff basically does an ""ok, I'm done"" and runs off the stage.

My advise...if you want your Jeff Dunham collection to be complete, buy this.  If you don't mind having your collection be incomplete, find a friend who has this or watch it on Netflix.  View this before you buy it, that way if you don't like it, you never bought it.  Part of me wishes I never bought it.",1451952000,,871,4.314814814814815
7427525,2,B0152AVXFI,"I really wanted to like this show as I've enjoyed Jeff Dunham's other work, but if you've seen any of his other shows, you've already seen this one. He recycles a lot of the same material over and over again. I was hoping for something new, and was disappointed when I didn't get it. I'm also not a fan of the commercial masquerading as material that is Little Jeff. I paid to see Jeff, not to learn how to create my own puppet show act.",1451952000,3,437,4.152941176470589

I'm from New York and we're the ones who are supposed to be uptight. The main point in comedy shows are the puns ( Hello! ). I can't believe he was actually booed within the first 5 minutes. The show as a whole was side splitting. Poor Peanut, I had never laughed so hard and oh my..... Achmed, your act definitely became unhinged.... Bravo! I completely recommend if you want to laugh so hard you pee a little! I give Jeff a standing ovation for his unscripted ability to quickly change his material due to the demographic expectations, although one can't honestly laugh at everything he does, you'd be exhausted!

7427551,5,B0152AVXFI,"Jeff Dunham delivers once again an amazing show with small portion of his part and then the dummy's speaking their mind and expressing themselves about many topics.  I will not spoil it for anyone who is a fan of Jeff Dunham, the uncensored version is full of language so def not for any kids to watch that version but the DVD gives you the choice to choose edited or unedited.  For myself I bought the DVD because I own all his DVD'S expect one called All over the Map,  this DVD had me crying from laughing so hard and almost fell out of bed on mutiple scenes of the special.  We all have our favorite characters when it comes to Jeff's dummy's but all the characters made me smile and laugh so hard, although the character Little Jeff made me laugh until I cried and held my ribs, imagine Walter voice mixed with a New York Gangster accent for Little Jeff.  Without ruin the show but buy this comedy special because if your a true fan of Jeff Dunham censor or uncensored it a great addition to the Dunham set which this makes his 7th comedy special and well worth the money.  In closing the special is roughly 70-75 minutes long and it's hard to make me laugh so hard my ribs hurt but this special did that so buy this DVD and see for yourself all the magical moments Jeff shares with all new material with him and the dummy's.",1448928000,8,1330,4.278884462151394

7427564,4,B0152AVXFI,"His more recent work is not as good as his older work.  I have his entire collection and this is not in the top half.  However, it is Jeff Dunham, so it is funny.  It is shorter than I would have liked.  There was only one special feature--a music video mashup which I had already seen on his Facebook page.",1448496000,11,307,4.066666666666666

7427569,5,B0152AVXFI,This video is hilarious.  I know that I will watch it numerous times.  We saw part of this routine when we went to Jeff Dunham's show in Las Vegas and it was just as funny now as it was then.,1448150400,3,191,3.75
7427570,5,B0152AVXFI,The adult version is hilarious! If you like Jeff Dunham this one for your collection. We laughed so hard we cried. Had to keep rewinding to hear parts we missed we were laughing so hard.,1448150400,,186,4.3428571428571425

7427583,3,B0152AVXFI,"I really like Jeff Dunham. I've seen him live and I've got the other DVD's, but I am really disappointed in this one. It's okay, but it just seems like he wasn't on the night they recorded the show. Blown jokes (good adlibs, but...), wardrobe failures (tossed Peanut, Achmed fell apart - numerous times)...
Now I know Achmed has lost an arm previously, but it was part of the act... the first drop could have been part of the act, but 2nd, 3rd? Rib cage falling off? Both arms.  The ""Little Jeff"" part was less than entertaining. The Peanut toss was a rhythm interruption. It was quite obvious it wasn't supposed to happen - some level of recovery, but...
Needs some new dummies and some fresher routines... Bubba J can disappear, Little Jeff can disappear, the Walter shtick is getting old....
I'll keep it for the collection, but this one won't be watched again like the others...",1447977600,3,882,4.617834394904459

7427586,5,B0152AVXFI,"We were pretty disappointed with the quality of Jeffs work on his last dvd(all over the map or something like that). I wasn't funny and we had truly just about given up on him. He definitely redeemed himself with this one. He has once again regained us as fans. Since his divorce, the tv show that bombed out, then that last fiasco of a dvd, his work just wasn't what we were used to seeing from him. Decided to give him one more try when  saw this advertised on tv. This is the Jeff we were all used to and had come to love. I laughed so hard I snorted in several parts. Obviously its mainly adult humor and it can be somewhat distasteful at times, but you just have overlook those parts and enjoy the rest of the show.",1447804800,9,720,4.142857142857143
