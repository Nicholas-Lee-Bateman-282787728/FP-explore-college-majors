7792707,5,0793606292,"The Amazon Library should offer this 1 hour extended version of the brilliant Charles Guggenheim 1/2 hour Academy Award winning Documentary precisely NOW, on the 125th Anniversary of this disaster.  The Johnstown Flood is the worst One day Loss of American Life on American soil prior to 9-11-2001.  Every Americans should know the whole truth about it.  The film narrated by actor Richard Dreyfus is worthless because it has been 'sanitized' of the culpability of the people responsible for the collapse of the South Fork Dam, and the resultant annihilation of over 2200 people, plus orphaned children, widowed men and women, and the destruction of Johnstown, Pennsylvania on May 31st 1889.

It is long past time a DVD of this film were made available for rent, and for purchase.  After all the truth has waited 125 years to be widely known.",1399161600,,842,4.943262411347518
7792708,5,0793606292,"This is the best documentary about the Johnstown Flood. Saw it in the early 90's on PBS. I have a feeling that The Carnegie Corporation who is a huge contributor to PBS has forced PBS to not re-release this great documentary to the public. Only the 30 minute version is available. The full length version does not cast a positive light on Andrew Carnegie. Due to financial troubles, PBS is now dependent on contributions from large corporations and those corporations now pull the strings at PBS. Very sad. Censorship of a former free voice.

The original book version that this film is based on is, The Johnstown Flood by David McCullough. It hasn't been censored and is a great read.",1377734400,3,685,4.708333333333333
7792709,4,0793606292,It's simply ridiculous that this has not been released to DVD. Instead the only DVD versions available are a short 30 minute version and longer but even more tepid version narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. This is based on David McCullough's book and really captures the drama of the disaster. It pulls no punches and lays the blame on the incompetence of the mountain resort in not maintaining the dam.,1366243200,4,399,4.797101449275362
