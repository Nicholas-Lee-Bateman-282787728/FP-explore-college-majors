8487892,5,B005WET4VU,"After watching Ip Man, I fell in love with Wing Chun Kung Fu and wanted to know more about the origin of the art - when low and behold a movie with the most simple title comes out - first I watched it online, and knew immediately I had to purchase it to I can bring my friends over to watch. Besides having the facts or storyline down pact, it's a great movie on it's own. It makes you feel happy, sad, angry and laughter every other scene - it's a really great informational film with serious action and surprisingly serious tone half way onwards - great movie 10/10!",1353456000,,568,4.220183486238532

Maybe even a little closer to the traditional story of Yim Wing Chun. Jing Bai is adorable as the title character.

8487895,4,B005WET4VU,Very enjoyable film although the original version is still my favorite.  Seems to use actual wing chun choreography although I am not a wing chun practitioner so take that opinion for what it is worth.  DVD quality good.  I prefer native language with subtitles and this version delivered as described.  Outtakes at the end were unexpected and great fun.,1328400000,2,354,4.9491525423728815
