SPOILER ALERT
I especially liked the touch when they're in the Police Patrol van.
The Giants baseball game is on the radio and you see 3 empty seats.
Just a simple transgression and you lose something that you've always enjoyed.",1490140800,,287,4.519230769230769

""A Step Out of Line"" is a gripping little caper film - with a twist.  The perpetrators (three middle-aged, money-strapped Korean War vets) are portrayed as the most upstanding characters in the amoral world they inhabit. That message gets a little preachy in one particular scene, with Peter Falk as insurance-man Harry Connors asking what constitutes a crime.  Yet that sermon is quite effective.  So are the performances of all three principles.  As noted by another reviewer, Vic Morrow's acting (here as  laid-off aerospace engineer Joe Rawlins) always implied a lot more going on below the surface.

And Peter Lawford, typecast in ""A Step Out of Line"" as swinging TV commercial producer Art Stoyer is particularly sensitive.  His character's observation at one point in the story that ""every man owes his country at least a little time in jail"" echoes the speech by Peter Falk mentioned earlier.  It IS the message of the film; the 1970's equivalent of ""whoever is without sin, let him cast the first stone"".

There is also the presence of the once ubiquitous, now largely forgotten, Jo Ann Pflug. As Gillian Francis, the devoted girlfriend of Stoyer, she looks stunning.  But she also exudes scene-grabbing personality in the mold of Dyan Cannon and Fran Jeffries (and resembles both of those smashing ladies very much).

Tom Bosley also puts in a nice turn as Connors boss, Jack Berger.  Berger's world-weary attitude toward the insurance cheats he deals with daily, is reflected also in the persona of detective Riddle, portrayed by John Randolph.

Along with Steven Spielberg's riveting ""Duel"", also from 1971, ""A Step Out of Line"" is an example of Network TV's early attempts to bring the ethos of independent cinema to its various Movie-of-the-Week platforms.  Unfortunately those quickly devolved to silly formula or sensationalism with the goal of highest ratings and lowest cost - the very amoral stance that ""A Step Out of Line"" excoriates.",1422748800,2,2087,5.055555555555555
8539590,2,B009CI8R56,I thought this would be a good movie considering the cast but the ending is bizarre and disappointing. I was disappointed,1391212800,,121,4.809523809523809
8539591,5,B009CI8R56,"A very interesting moral tale with a satisfying ending for all concerned. Peter Falk heads the cast along with smooth Peter Lawford and the talented Vic Morrow who, in my opinion, deserved a better career post Combat! Vic plays the most complex character.  A nice sharp print makes for an enjoyable ninety plus minutes of classic early 1970s entertainment. Here's hoping CBS will continue to release more of the rare
TV movies of the late sixties and seventies.",1388016000,6,461,4.910256410256411
