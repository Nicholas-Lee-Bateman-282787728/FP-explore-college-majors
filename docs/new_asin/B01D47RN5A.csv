7697020,5,B01D47RN5A,"How wonderful to find this documentary.  One of my all time favorite movies was Le Chambon about these people in France.  It's only available on VHS, but I would suggest it to anyone.  This documentary really delved into the area of France and the people ... then and now.",1464652800,4,272,4.510204081632653
7697021,5,B01D47RN5A,"One more excellent film about some of the many people who saved Jews and others during WWII. Every story I've ever heard about people who put their lives at risk to save a Jew is just remarkable. It occurred everywhere. A family friend who lived in the Netherlands during that time, was also involved in harboring and saving many Jews. They were recognized for their work by the Israeli govt. and honored with the ""Order of the Righteous Gentile"" and have a place in the Holocaust exhibit in Jerusalem. I would hope someone someday recognizes the efforts of the citizens of the Central Plateau in France in a similar fashion. They all deserve such honor. Their actions need to be remembered. We cannot allow such prejudice and hatred to exist towards anyone not like us. This is an important lesson to reinforce in today's world.

These people chose love over hate. We should do the same.",1475712000,4,888,4.6923076923076925

7697024,1,B01D47RN5A,Very little information was shared by descendants of those that hid Jews on their farms. They seemed to prefer not to talk about it.  I guess I was expecting to hear some survival stories similar to what I heard at the Holocaust Museum.,1472515200,,236,4.488372093023256

7697029,5,B01D47RN5A,"This film shows the courage and strength of character of a community of people who are self-described as simple farmers. When faced with the horrors of the percussion of people because of their religion or beliefs they quietly set about providing them shelter. This film presents this community in a revealing but soft manner. Along with the films simple portrayal of how a people acted with humanity in a time when the act of humanity could get you executed, a strong message in how to live according to the simple but profound message of the Gospel the film is beautifully, I would say magnificently shot. You could watch the film with the sound off and it would still be a strong and moving piece because of the way the region is cinematically displayed.",1466899200,4,757,4.6992481203007515

8754850,2,B01D47RN5A,Very little information conveyed.  No insight into heroism.  Insufficient context provided.  Well worth skipping.,1508112000,,113,6.928571428571429
8754851,5,B01D47RN5A,"I actually was moved by the stories and the bravery of the folks of this little town.  How many would also try to do this, and in a peaceable but strategic manner?

Today, there exists persecution of yet another religious group in Russia, ...Jehovah's Witnesses.  There are over 170,000 - who are facing persecution,imprisonment, and the confiscation of their personal property, as well as the liquidation of the property, and buildings they use to worship.

Why?  Because the government considers them extremist.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  They are peaceable in every manner and lifestyle.  Yet, they are being forced to do things that any person in this country would fight.  They will lose their homes.  Many could be sent to prison because they preach door to door. Or jailed if they go to worship.  The charges are unfounded, and misunderstood. It is a Legal Battle due to take place in April 2017, in Russia Federation.

You would think this sort of thing went to the wayside with the last world war?  But it has been going on in some countries...such as Russia.
There are horrendous personal stories that are still taking place.  Even in countries such as communist Korea.

So...no, the world has not learned any lessons.  Sad, isn't it?  Jehovah's witnesses have done much to help make Freedom of Religion a constitutional right in the U.S....and yet - some places are still in the dark ages.",1490918400,,1416,4.833333333333333

This offers great insight into brave men and women helping to save Jews in France. Well told and, no matter how long ago, a reminder that we all need to be part of saving grace.",1481241600,2,349,4.072463768115942
