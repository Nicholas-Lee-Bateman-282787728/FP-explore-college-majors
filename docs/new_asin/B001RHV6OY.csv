8337977,3,B001RHV6OY,"Strange artsy movie about a painter who loses most of his sight, and a maid, daughter of a prostitute, who live in quite different worlds, but eventually(way eventually) cross paths.

The direction and style of the movie, which mostly takes place in a poor community, is interesting and well done.  The artist pretty much forces isolation on himself except for a growing relationship with a nun, while he hides his blindness from his aging but also blind father.

Mei the maid struggles with her life with her mom, a boyfriend and the growing probability of having to sell herself, too, as the limited options in her world diminish in a different way.  An air of sexuality, whether in the name of art, violence, or business, pervades the film.  There are a few shots of nudity, and somewhat concealed sexual acts.  *SPOILER* Near the end, when the two finally meet up, he purchases time with her, and paints her body red, apparently because he can see it better.  Other than rubbing the paint all over her naked body there's no other hanky panky.  He thanks her, and she too, thanks him later down the road.  Ok.  *END SPOILER*

I gave it three stars because the ending is so abrupt and whoosh! off they go, and the actual time between the two leads is short, and in my humble opinion, weird and not particularly moving.  The movie more or less kept my interest, and I was sympathetic towards Mei, but I wouldn't want to watch it again.",1304985600,,1436,4.588235294117647
8337978,5,B001RHV6OY,"This is a film about beauty not only on the weakening eyes of a sensitive beholder, but is also a movie about bringing up splendor of all characters and situations. It shows that drama and magnificence can be developed simultaneously in a moving picture. Beauty is shown in sensual corporeal conditions, and also in spiritually delicacy. Kindness and brilliance are on both sides o the camera.",1283731200,,393,4.96969696969697
