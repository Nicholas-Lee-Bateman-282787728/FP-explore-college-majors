3881078,1,B0029W2V8G,"Just got this video.  I'm a big Ted fan, I only live a little way from his home town, have seen him in concert several times.  Upon playing this video, I could not even hear or understand the words being sung, Ted starts out singing, I guess, but you cannot understand what he is saying, his back-up singers can be heard better than him.  Sound quality is terrible.  The video jumps around from one view to another view very fast, a lot of the video is the audience which I could care less about.  I only watched the first few songs and was so disappointed that I turned Ted off and probably won't play him again.  Very disappointed Uncle Ted, you can do better than this.  If you're going to buy a Ted video, take a chance on a different one, don't buy this one, it's terrible.",1254787200,5,778,4.2517006802721085
3881079,4,B0029W2V8G,"Taking off some stupidities that Ted talks and shows, this is a great rock and roll show. The blu-ray has a good video and sound.",1252800000,2,129,4.2
3881080,2,B0029W2V8G,"Video quality...check...audio quality...check...right-wing mumbo jumbo...check...set list...good with the exception of Soul Man, which seemed completely out of place. However, I've been a Sweaty Teddy fan since the beginning and I've owned most of his records at one time or another.  I saw him with the Damn Yankees and he was great. Sadly, I've always suspected that Ted should not front a band and this video proves it.  He's best when teamed with someone who can motivate an audience.  For example, Derek St. Holmes, who demonstrated that Ted has no stage presence by comparison.  The songs that Holmes sings are miles above Ted and he effortlessly gets the audience going, whereas Ted just struggles.  Notice how many times he says ""Independence Day"", ""Freedom"", and ""Motor City"" to get a cheap rise from the audience....at least 50 times throughout the show.  This is acceptable two or three times but it is just embarrassing that he needs to try so hard.  I wonder what his dialogue consists of when he's not playing in Detroit on July 4th.  And what is it with referring to himself in the third person as Uncle Teddy at least a dozen times?  That seemed a little creepy to me.  It got to the point where I was cringing, seeing him pandering so badly. By the end, I couldn't take it anymore.",1252800000,17,1298,4.780269058295964
3881081,5,B0029W2V8G,"What can I say ... some things never change ... the seasons, birth, death, taxes, and Ted Nugent. The self indulgent hunter/rocker is still going at it in his 60's ...and I swear, it seems some have made a pact with the devil because they stay forever young. Mick Jagger, Chuck Berry, Steven Tyler, Paul McCartney, and uncle Ted  (at least in appearance). This concert focus' on a hometown show in Detroit, and Ted is in top form, playing most of his hits, and a few covers. He humbles himself as much as Ted can and pays homage to some of his hero's including the drummer from Mitch Ryder and the Detroit wheels (who has seemed to make a pact with the devil too), his original guitar teacher (no pact here), and the original singer who does a dynomite job on Stranglehold. You either love or hate Ted, I happen to love him...because he delivers...maybe he has a right to be self indulgent.",1252800000,,890,4.460122699386503
3881082,5,B0029W2V8G,"I love Uncle Ted. His 6,000th concert has to be one of his best. He brings the rock, and a few surprise guests and surprise songs along this rock n' roll thrillride of full bluntal nuggity! Buy it if you're a Ted-Fan!",1252540800,3,217,4.190476190476191

An Energy Centre is a great place for a concert like this, because, this is a very entergetic concert! It is also a celebration of 40+ years of touring, all over the world by Ted Nugent. Also, it is a celebration of Freedom, Independence, and the 4th of July (The ""Birthday of our Nation). The crowd is really into this one, and Ted has excellent interaction with the crowd of 20,000+ people. At the beginning you get a beautiful woman, dressed in a bikini, coming out of a large 4th of July, imitation birthday day cake.

The basic line-up includes:
Ted Nugent on lead vocals, lead guitar and bow & arrow.
Mick Brown on ""Thunder"" drums.
Greg Smith on  ""Funkbrother"" bass.

Also, you get guest musicians as follows:

23. Outro

Overall, this is an outstanding, ""high-entergy"", well performed concert by Ted and his band, and the guest musicians. The approxiamte running time is 123 minutes.
This is Ted Nugent at his best. This is pure 100% American Rock & Roll at its best!!!! Thanks!!!!",1252368000,10,1825,4.62037037037037
3881084,5,B0029W2V8G,"For about $10, you get two hours of Ted, with great footage, great camera work, great sound, and amazing musicians.  As always, Ted is a show all by himself, but this DVD has Derek back (and in fine form), one song with Ted's guitar teacher from his childhood (how great is that?) and Johnny Badanjek sits in on drums for ""Jenny Take A Ride"".  Great great stuff, and for this price, it's a steal.  Not to mention the flaming arrow, at the end of the show.

3881085,5,B0029W2V8G,"If you are a Ted Nugent fan or just an appreciator of good hard fun Rock n Roll, this is a must have. This was filmed locally in Michigan at DTE (formerly to most of us ""Pine Knob"")last July 4th, 2008. It was a celebration of freedom and in your face guitar riffs and lyrics that you have come to know and love. What made it even more special was Derrick St. Holmes was on hand to sing Stranglehold, Hey Baby and more. That in itself was worth the money spent on the video. GET IT. YOU WILL LOVE IT.",1247443200,22,499,4.0
3881086,5,B0029W2V8G,"First of all let me say that this release blows away, no it actually shatters the Sweden Rocks DVD released last year.  I was put back by that release, Ted in Sweden, recording a live DVD?? It just didn't seem right.  This release shows Ted let loose in his element, an enthusiastic hometown crowd (but don't be fooled by the number of persons in attendance, I am sure it was some sort of town fest Ted was playing which he ususally packs those people in who pay about $10.00), but this shows Ted is much more comfortable here, and he just let's 'er rip! A great 2 hour show, shows terrible Ted playing so many yesteryear classics, a few latter year classics (that's right Fred Bear baby!), and to see him properly get it right bringing the man!, Derek St Holmes out to sing Hey Baby and Stranglehold, and he also stays on for Cat Scratch.  My only gripe, and yes it's very minor, but if you are going to release an all-out show, have all guns blazing, a celebration of your musicall legacy, and history (Ted's guitar shows up on Honky Tonk), I felt Ted shoulda had the voice of his Weekend Warriors release, Charlie Hunh on for I Need You Bad, and Weekend Warriors...but that doesn't deduct any points off this release as this is essential for any and all Ted fans.  You will not be sorry you picked this up on Blu Ray!",1246579200,2,1320,4.353658536585366
3881087,5,B0029W2V8G,"This is a solid 2 hour kick butt Ted Nugent show  with the addition of legendary front  man Derek  St Holmes bringing his unmistakable voice to the hits he originally sang , Hey Baby and Stranglehold as well as offering support on Cat Scratch Fever.  The blu-ray looks terrific and I'm a very pleased owner. One could make small quibbles about song choices (I wish those two had done  Just what the Doctor ordered) ....but its a pretty darned good  set list.  There are no extra features and I would  have thought an interview with the never camera shy Tedster would have been obvious....we do  hear  enough from him  over the 2 hours to keep us happy.",1246492800,3,652,4.487179487179487

If you are not one of the other 7 rockers in the whole world who feels the same you might really like this show. I like several of Uncle Ted's songs, especially Hey Baby. All his best songs are featured in this show and the band does a respectable job on every one-- not a great job but pretty good... same for Ted himself. If he had just kept his dialogue rated PG13 I would not have thrown the disk in the trash. On the bright side, I've used the blu-ray box to replace a damaged one I had for a Bad Company disk.",1341360000,2,585,3.9661016949152543

3881121,5,B0029W2V8G,"If you're a Ted fan, you need this.  The Blu Ray and DTS sound track are all you can ask for.  Ted is, as always, a rock guitar giant and his playing is as good as it ever was.  If you're an old time fan like myself, you'll be happy to see some old friends like the Gibson Byrdland and Derek St Holmes.  Ted with a Les Paul or PRS is like Jimmy Page with a Strat to me.  Derek obviously was a big part of what made the 4 albums he was on work so well.  Nothing before or after those four were nearly as good.  With nothing available from the full beard and suspenders era of the Nuge, this is as good as it's likely to get.  Enjoy.",1317859200,2,631,3.8

3881123,3,B0029W2V8G,"This review is short and sweet. 'Uncle Ted' can still play the guitar, and this was a good show, but the crowd did not seem to be into it, by looking at them. My problem with the editing is the crowd looks dead at times (why pay your money if you're going to nap through the show) but for some unknown reason, which is the case with many concert vids, we feel the need to crank the crowd volume up to '10'. If you're not sure what I am talking about, go back and watch at least the beginning. Ted walks out on stage, and my ears begin to ring, not from the music, but the crowd noise, but when you look at them, about half of them look asleep.

Aside from that...very good show. Would have loved to hear a version of 'Hibernation', but that's the breaks. Three stars due to the audience noise. The concert itself....four stars.",1276473600,2,827,4.20125786163522

This Blu-ray with Derek St. Holmes as special guest on vocals during ""Stranglehold"" and ""Hey Baby"" is worth the price. I wish Derek could have done 10 songs as he is the true voice of Nugent for the 1975-1978 song period. Would love to have heard ""Just what the Doctor Ordered"".I've been a Ted Nugent Fan since the Amboy Dukes and this is a great way to enjoy ""Uncle Ted"" in all his 4th of July Glory.

3881126,4,B0029W2V8G,"A 2-hour long show by this mighty rock'n roll guitarrist. The Dokken rhythm section is as good as any other Uncle Ted's has played with before but a second guitarrist would have beefed up the sound a little. Lots of guests and all but there are some inconsistencies I want to point out and let me tell you that despite these, the show and performance are excellent.

Contrary to a lot of people, I do like the way he handles main vocals, even when it's a well known fact he does it because he wants all of the attention. But it's the way they're mixed in that I dislike, it's a constant yelling burying everything else, even the guitar; I had to set the volume considerably lower than I'm used to, so I could cope with the shouting. The show is shot in broad daylight but it doesn't detract from the fun. It's like an all-ages matine.
Ted's vocals and guitar comes out a lot louder from one of the frontal speakers so I had to resort to setting the amp to mono; this did the trick making the sound even.

Problem with the setlist is that Ted almost always plays the same-old, same-old  and rarely ventures into his more obscure material. News : he didn't on this dvd either. His in-between-songs banter is so pathetically right-winged, pro-war, pro-hunting it's laughable so I always find it highly amusing.....in a sad way.

All in all a good purchase just to watch this master of the fretboard in action.",1257984000,4,1406,4.4591439688715955
