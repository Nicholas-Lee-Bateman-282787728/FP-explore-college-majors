8356895,5,B0028S9GIY,"These 3 short World War 2 films about the fight against Japan are some of the most interesting documentaries about that time.""December 7th"" depicts that day with grat realism using actual footage and reconstructed scenes. We also learn some of the names and faces of the brave men that lost their lives on that day. Interesting to note that many of the damaged ships are salvaged and restored for the war effort. ""The Fighting Lady"" is about an aircraft carrier. Once again we learn something about the servicemen and those that died in combat. Stunning air attacks, and some cool crash landings on the carrier deck also. Finally, there's ""To the Shores of Iwo Jima"", one of the most important battles in the Pacific. These films are intersting, informative, and exciting. But most importantly, it reminds us of the amazing sacrifices of our fighting men in one of America's, and the world's most pivital times.",1241654400,3,911,4.883870967741935
