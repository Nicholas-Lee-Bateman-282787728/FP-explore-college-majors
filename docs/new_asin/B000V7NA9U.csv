8217113,3,B000V7NA9U,"This set was the 3 disc set that included the first two monthly TNA PPV's (Victory Road & Turning Point '04) and the first all steel caged PPV (Lockdown '05). This was basically during the ""Dusty Rhodes"" booking era so there's alot of hits & misses.

Victory Road:
20 Man X Division Gauntlet (Royal Rumble style match) - Hit
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division Vol. 1"" DVD

Ron Killings, Johnny B. Badd (Marc Mero), Pat Kennedy (Simon Diamond), Erik Watts vs. The Naturals, Kid Kash & Dallas (Lance Hoyt) - Would have been a miss if the crowd wasn't so into it.

Mascratita Sagrada vs. Piratita Morgan - Midget match. You'll either like this one or hate this one.

NWA Tag Team Champions Team Canada vs. 3 Live Cru - Crowd was really into it so it's a hit.

Trinity vs. Jacqueline - Miss

Monster's Ball: Monty Brown vs. Raven vs. Abyss - Hit but not as violent as anticipated.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD

X-Division Champion Petey Williams vs. AJ Styles - Normally I would say hit but too much interference from Scott D. so it's a miss.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division"" DVD

Last Team Standing Match: America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X - Hit but not one of their best matches.

Ladder Match: NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Jeff Hardy - Hit and the match of the night. Look for the Outsiders reunion here.
Note: Also available on the ""Enigma: Best Of Jeff Hardy"" DVD

Turning Point:
NWA Tag Team Champions 3 Live Cru vs. Team Canada - Hit

Sonjay Dutt, Hector Garza, Sonny Siaki vs. Kid Kash, Matt Bentley, Frankie Kazarian - Hit

Serengeti Survival Match: Monty Brown vs. Abyss - Hit

Pat Kenney & Johnny B. Badd vs. Glenn Gilberti (Disco Infernio) & Johnny Swinger with a Jacqueline as the Special Referee - Miss is an understatement, this is a dud.

Diamond Dallas Page defeated Raven - Hit

X-Division Champion Petey Williams vs. Chris Sabin - Hit

Macho Man Randy Savage, AJ Styles, & Jeff Hardy defeated The Kings of Wrestling (Jeff Jarrett, Kevin Nash, & Scott Hall) - It's a hit except for the crappy ending & the fact that Savage didn't show up until the last min. of the match.
Note: Also available on the Jeff Hardy DVD

Six Sides of Steel: America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X - To say this match is a hit would be the ultimate understatement.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD

Also they did backstage skits revolving around ""Vince McMahon"" & ""Triple H"" looking for the tape of an incident when the WWE was at Universal Studios filming a commercial for the WWE Royal Rumble '05 and TNA wrestlers invaded the catering area with one wrestler coming out (Rey Mysterio eventhough his face is blured, you can recognize is tattoos) just to say hi to his friend Konnan.

Lockdown '05
Apolo & Sonny Siaki vs. Lance Hoyt & Chris Candido - Dud only because the first minute is when Candido broke his ankle due to one of the guys fell on it after a dropkick.

2 Out Of 3 Falls ""Prince Of Darkness Match"": Dustin Rhodes vs. Bobby Rude - Dud.

Ultimate Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley (with Trinity) vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt - Hit and that moonsault Trinity hit was insane.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division"" DVD

Table Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Raven - Hit
Note: Also available on the Jeff Hardy DVD

Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. Team Canada (Petey Williams & Eric Young) - Hit

X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Primetime Elix Skipper - Hit

Lethal Lockdown Match: DDP, Sean Waltman, B.G. James vs. Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, Kip James - Hit

AJ Styles vs. Abyss - Hit
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD

There's also the Chris Candido tribute which is a six tag tag team match from IMPACT (don't remember everyone involved right now); The Naturals with Candido facing America's Most Wanted for the tag team titles; and his last TV appearence co-hosting TNA Xplosion.

Normally I would say just get the Lockdown PPV since the best matches from the other two are on other TNA DVD's but since your getting 3 for the price of 1 or 2...I recommend.",1206316800,2,4144,4.5113788487282465
