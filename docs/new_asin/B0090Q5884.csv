Stunned by the realization of his grandpa even having a kid as his age and with her mother no where to be found. Thus leaving the poor girl alone with no one to care for; Daikichi sees no other choice then to take her under his wing and raise her himself.
Daikichi quickly learns the responsibilities and hardships of parenthood (Buying food, Bed, Clothing, Nursery school etc..) and at times can't help but feel overwhelmed. Daikichi also learns that Rin can be quite mature for her age like making her own meals or even console him when he is feeling down.
""Sometimes I wonder if I'm raising Rin, or if shes the one raising me...""
Unfortunately, the anime only runs for 11 episodes but it does have a nice ending that did not disappoint and I would recommend to anyone whose is looking for something warm and lighthearted <3",1381104000,,1049,4.526315789473684

I was looking for something to watch (on Crunchyroll) & nothing about this series jumped out at me. So I watched the first episode and finished watching the series in one sitting.

 Without given anything away to much....Basic premises is a man goes to his Grand Fathers funeral. Upon getting there he notices a small child running around the house. He asks his mother ""Whos child is that?"" she tells him it is his Grand Father's and while everyone thinks it is shameful that their grand father would have a child at his age and out of wedlock. He just thinks...""Gramps...that sly old dog"". Well as things go there was no Grandma and family members are sitting around trying to decide what to do with her. Family member after family member gives an excuse as to why they can not take her in. When one of them says ""Well we should put her in an orphanage""...thats when he has heard enough. He goes and asks the adorable little girl if she wants to come home with him, to which she agrees.

 From there on it is the story of a man - never been married and has no idea on how to raise a child but he has a good heart and goes to great lenths to make her feel loved.

 As for me this was a outstanding series...the animation is great. It is not your standard animation it is lightly drawn in a wide screen format, if that make any sense, which adds to realism. I would highly recommend for fans of Kanon - Clannad etc. It plays more like a continious story and not so much stand alone episodes. Although time passes between some episodes you are never left with the feeling of...Did I miss something?...What happened...Where did that person come from etc. A very well done series with feeling.",1362614400,,1799,4.387387387387387

8533381,5,B0090Q5884,"I saw this series online. Immediately it struck me as something heartwarming. And please don't start with the manga version versus the anime rendition. These eleven episodes cover the trials and tribulations of the pair in the manga in the first half of their relationship...and it stayed very true to the original. It's approach both simplistic and sweet. From the animation to the background music. Could not asked for more. A very recommended one to watch. The opening song is by the Japanese pop duo PUFFY (Puffy Ami Ayumi) titled SWEET DROPS was very upbeat. And yes, I bought the singles soundtrack too ^_^
THANX a much NIS AMERICA for releasing this.",1355875200,5,657,4.875
