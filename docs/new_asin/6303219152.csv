613980,5,6303219152,"Aliens Deadly Spawn is a product of the early 80s fascination with fake blood and giant latex monsters. Filming on  a meager budget of just $25,000 dollars (approx $59,000 today) director Douglas McKeown does wonders with what would otherwise be a total crap-fest.

Fans of monster movies will love this film. Fans of bloody b-movies will love this film. Fans of anything 80s will love this film. Basically, anyone who actually found their way to this blog and is taking the time to read this review will love this film.

The most successful film formula back then (and probably today as well) is the single location, limited cast, horror film. Wondering why? Simple:

Single location means the studio doesnt need to spend a lot of money renting locations or moving everything around. It also means the director doesnt need to spend months in pre-production scouting locations. Limited cast means exactly that, limited. Dont need to spend a lot of money on actors and/or contracts with a small cast. This allows more money for other expenses, or extra money to nail down one well known actor.
Horror film is pretty self explanatory, but because I love to hear myself type I will explain anyway. Horror films are popular, have always been popular, and will always be popular. So if you have a low budget, a decent script, and some people willing to work for almost nothing (or preferably nothing) you have the opportunity to make a film that will be remembered long after youve realized your dream doesnt pay the bills and you go back to working 9-5 somewhere you hate.

(Return of) The Aliens Deadly Spawn cashes in on all three formulas for success. The film is obviously low budget but youd never expect it to be $25k! Even todays inflated rate of $59k is ridiculous when compared to some of the s*** sandwiches Hollywood is pumping out with million dollar budgets.

What makes Deadly Spawn exceptionally fun to watch is the creature effects. Remember this is the pre-CGI era of film making, when practical effects ruled the medium. In this case, the aliens and their spawn are just a pleasure to witness in action. Unlike todays reliance on CGI everything, these monsters are down right terrifying with their undulating tubular bodies and the wet blood they clearly bathe in each time they score a kill.

Q: Why the two names? Is it Return of or just Deadly Spawn Youre confusing me!
A: The original title was just The Aliens Deadly Spawn, but they changed it to Return of the Aliens Deadly Spawn to cash in on the success of Alien (yes, Ridley Scotts Alien). I know right, total marketing whores.

Q: So you're saying the cheesy monster with the fake blood looks better than a CGI monster does nowadays?
A: Absolutely, and it makes filming more realistic because the actors are actually interacting with the big monster rather than imagining where it is and what its doing.

Q: This movie look stupid.
A: No you're stupid. Besides, thats not a question. 

Q: Good date movie?
A: Yea. Its fun and campy, lots of blood and body parts but the inclusion of the monster makes it pure sci-fi/fantasy.

Q: How about the kids?
A: Sure! Get some popcorn and the whole family together. Its like watching a Disney film only with mass amounts of people eating.  SERIOUSLY??!! Come on, its bloody as hell and has body parts in it. My kids will need to wait until they are at least 6 years old.

Q: Where or where can I get a copy of this?
A: Anywhere. Its a cult favorite and is available on blue-ray, Amazon, etc.",1433894400,2,3505,4.659643435980551
613981,5,6303219152,"An incredibly low-budget outing with z-list actors, this overlooked film is redeemed mostly by it's creature effects, which dwarf the less-than-stellar acting (though let's be honest, these films weren't heralded for their acting anyway).

613982,5,6303219152,"Blu Ray Review: Elite Entertainment version. I don't know what people are b****in' about but this Blu Ray release was good. More and likely it's because everyone has a hard on for HD remastering and it's stupid as hell. The picture quality is fine and watchable so up yours. This Blu-Ray contains a lot of s*** like audio commentary, gag reel, actors screening, and other stuff.

Movie Review: This is a very well shot film for being very low budgeted. Of course, the story and acting was terrible but that is what defines an 80's horror film and if you can't except it, then die. The parasitic monsters are cool looking, the splatter is actually abundant for an R rated movie, and all that. I highly recommend this movie for B-Grade lovers.

614062,5,6303219152,"The Deadly Spawn, produced in part by artist Tim Hildebrandt, starring his son Charles George Hildebrandt as the hero of the piece (Charles, a boy preoccupied with all things horror).
For this type of horror/Sci-fi hybrid, it's almost a prerequisite that a falling meteor starts the film off.  The deadly spawn are first glimpsed as shadow puppets against the side of a tent.  From that inauspicious start, they soon grow to classic proportions in the basement of Sam and Barb's house.  Poor Sam and Barb, after serving breakfast, or rather, serving as breakfast, their multi-toothed guest soon outgrows this dank dwelling place and spreads out.  There's plenty of blood, Barb's head gets a good working over.  The hero is a ten year old boy willing to accept things at face value, as opposed to his pompous older brother who can't believe anything unless it's written in a book and even then, he has to argue the point.  ""They call it science fiction because that's what it is!""
Fabulous on every level, this is a gem I'm glad I stumbled across by accident.  Definitely one of my favorite monster movies.  And finally, the cover art on the DVD nails it precisely.  That's exactly what you can expect.",1369699200,2,1201,4.79126213592233

I rented this on Amazon Instant and it was so worth, so much in fact that I went out and got it on Special Edition DVD which I have yet to check out but I hear the transfer is very well done. Also the movie was very cheap to purchase so I actually recommend that you buy it instead if your into 80s cheese horror movies. Also I would be careful with the Blu-ray version because I heard it was a very bad transfer so that's why I got it on DVD instead.",1369353600,,655,3.9323308270676693
614174,5,6303219152,"A meteorite crash lands on earth in the woods near a campsite. The friends or homosexual couple out in the woods are both attacked are eaten and we see the shadow of the creature as it begins to grow. The credits role and we hear an awesome theme. We're introduced to an odd family. Charlie the youngest son loves monsters(just like I do), his brother is a scientist/psychology student, his uncle is a psychiatrist/psychologist, and everyone else is just everyone else. Charlies mom and dad are leaving for vacation, his mother goes into the basement and is eaten by the beast, his father goes down and we get our first glimpse of the creature. Later Charlie comes across the beasty and all of it's offspring. The monster regurgitates Charles's mom's head and several baby beasts bite off her skin. The creature's can sense vibration and sound. The aunt leaves to go to a party and the beasties show up at said house. In this fairly disturbing scene a bunch of elderly women are being attacked and bitten by several baby creatures. Mean while Charles's brother's friends show up and bring with them one of the dead creatures. They dissect said thing and can't decide what it is or where it's from. Soon the large mother beast begins to attack the rest of the house hold. The kids come across the uncle who's gotten his eyes eaten and inside and outside his body is swarming with the little beasts. A girl shows up only to be eaten by the big alien creature. Charlie finally kills the large alien. We then cut to a large # of people going through grass and dirt finding the creatures which may have spread around the whole planet. At the very end out from the ground comes a humongous creature much larger than a house and we cut to the end credits and we hear another awesome theme. The creature design is unique and I really like it. The film is a throw back to 50s sci-fi films namely The Blob 1958 and It! Terror from Beyond Space! 1958. The effects are astounding and were made with only 20,000 dollars that's a low budget and it is amazing by how much they were able to achieve. There's plenty of gore and plenty of blood which looks amazing. Most of the  acting is descent and the characters are likeable.  There's comic on the dvd that gives us the creatures origin, they were biology weapons created by an alien race for war. The film had a sequel but it didn't have much to do with the first film so it became it's own thing the only reason to see the so called ""sequel"" is for it's special effects which are amazing, the sequel is called Metamorphosis: The Alien Factor released in 1990. This is one of my favorite horror films and one of the best, it's a great low budget film that still holds up today. I payed 14 bucks but I would pay 50 bucks for this fantastic flick. Both the film and dvd get up to 5/5 stars equaling up to 10 stars. Now onto the content of the dvd
Only one disc:
Main feature
Two audio commentaries
Still galleries, behind the scenes photos, make up effects, and premiere in New York City

614176,3,6303219152,"Based on the reviews of this movie, I decided to add this movie to my 80s collection. Not bad for a low budget film, but while for the budget it had, the special effects were good, the acting on the other hand shows its low budget side. I found myself laughing at parts of the movie. This special edition comes with extras, commentary, etc which is a plus. The DVD quality (in my opinion) was decent, but I have clearly seen better. Some scenes were dark and hard to see and some grain. But for a low budget film, this is expected.  I would of given it 4 stars, but the acting reminded me of watching movies like ""Unhinged and The Prey""  This is pretty much a film for monster movie lovers out there, people who enjoyed the drive in circuit (as I did) or something to watch with friends.",1366243200,,787,4.24

614178,4,6303219152,"If you like monster movies and cheap gore effects that make a solid effort, I say see it!  This is a fun flick and all of the filmmakers' mistakes come off as funny.

Much as in The Blob (1988) or Alien Predators (1985), a meteor (or...something...whatever) lands on Earth and brings with it horrible amorphous agents of gory death.  Before we have any notion of a story we see a little of our anthropophagous extraterrestrials.  They look like giant multi-headed worm Muppets loaded with teeth and two googly stalked claws.  This abominatiom's numerous larvae, which have infested the basement of a New Jersey home, are like little tadpole Alien chestbursters.  Really kind of cute.

Our protagonists include a preteen monster movie enthusiast, a ""science major"" college kid and his college friends.  These college kids get a hold of a dead larva and try to use their science knowledge to classify its placement in the animal kingdom, dissect it and look up what it is.  One of them demands a college biology textbook so that he can solve this biological mystery--with a dead serious face!  [My kids aren't going to THAT kid's college!]  Meanwhile the preteen learns that the monster is blind but quite responsive to sound.  While this may seem critical, the filmmakers somehow never made a big deal of this.

While these kids try to academically sleuth the identity of these little abominations, the larvae spread from the basement ""nest"" and into neighbors' homes and plumbing.

The gore is wonderful.  Some serious effort was made for scenes involving tearing off and eating a woman's face, and terrorizing a vegetarian group's weekly pot luck.

In the end the preteen single-handedly defeats the monster with a screwdriver, a sky pole, a Halloween mask and an extension cord in one of the most painfully drawn out monster kills in monster movie history.  It's like MacGuyver but without the awesome.  The final scene is laughable, but it works given the budget and humor of the movie.

If you like gore and monster movies, I say see it!  This is a fun flick and all of the filmmakers' mistakes come off as funny.",1360454400,2,2117,4.844011142061281

Some of the actors actually make their roles interesting, no mean challenge in low budget productions.  The rainy setting is a plus, and many scenes had a dark background, which added to the creep factor.

As an aspiring (and unfortunately for the world thus far undiscovered) script writer myself, I tend to focus on story lines and dialogue when watching movies. In this one dialogue was used to discuss some interesting science-related observations, or flesh out characters, but the pace suffered as a result. Those conversations wouldn't be overly wordy in real life, but a B movie needs action to keep viewers from noticing various deficiencies due to budgetary constraints, such as the monster FX in this case.",1349654400,2,805,5.045112781954887

614244,5,6303219152,"This is a low budget movie shot on 16mm film.  Despite it's budget, I thought the creatures were more lifelike and effective than most big budget CGI creature creations.  I would prefer this film over the remake of THE THING any day.  The simple story involves a crashed meteor and the creature that emerges from it. It kills a couple of campers, and then the toothy worm like monster takes residence in the basement of an isolated country house.  The creature is blind and hears by sound only, and it begins spawning numerous little worm monsters.  After it begins killing off the residents in the house, a kid who's a big horror fan tries to destroy it.  The film begins quickly with blood and gore.  After a couple people are killed in the very beginning, the monster also kills a couple more people as soon as it gets into the basement; but it slows up later and gets a little too talky at times.  The gore effects are excellent, but the film contains some unnecessary dialogue scenes that go on for a little too long; I thought if they kept the pace fast at all times, a monster movie like this would've been even better. However, those creatures look great and the replay value is still very good.  It's still a great film despite having some small problems. This is mostly an indoors film, so some people may or may not like that. You've got those creatures in the basement and people in the house with that kid who's a horror fan; this is basically the film. It's a gory, very easy to follow monster flick to watch on a rainy day or at night. There's no nudity in the movie.

 I thought the color and contrast needs a little improvement, but the quality is very good.  The animated menu and chapter screens with music are also nice.",1341187200,2,1740,4.437106918238993

I'm talking really gross special FX, and none of that CGI crap. They had to create all this stuff by hand and the love they poured into it shows in every crazy, blood-splashed frame. Seriously, The Deadly Spawn is what every awful SyFy Channel movie should aspire to be: entertaining, gory, and respectful to both its genre and target audience.

I've loved this movie since I was a teenager and first rented it on VHS under the ridiculous title, Return of the Aliens Deadly Spawn. It had the goriest VHS box in history, with no shots of the actors or anything boring, just monsters and mutilated victims! I've even got the issue of Cinemagic that shows how to build your own Deadly Spawn! This is one of the movies that made me interested in how to create special effects.

614246,5,6303219152,"The Deadly Spawn (1983) may be may be a low budget horror thriller, but it puts its money in the right place, as the wormlike alien creature featured in the film, is probably one of the more memorable and iconic monsters to come out of the 1980's.  The cast of unknowns, many appearing in their first and only film, deliver some very solid performances, giving the movie a sense of realism.  Directed by Douglas McKeown, and featuring some impressive, well placed special effects, and campy gore, The Deadly Spawn is a minor horror classic.

When a meteor crashes in a wooded area of New Jersey, it brings an alien lifeform to Earth.  After apparently snacking on a couple of campers, the wormlike creature makes its way inside the basement of a small house, and begins feeding on the family living there.  With a quick reproductive cycle, the creature produces a brood of carnivorous amphibian type young, who make their way through the house, and also spread throughout the neighborhood.  Young Charlie (Charles George Hildebrandt) is wandering in the basement, when he encounters the huge multi-headed creature, and what remains of his mother.  Charles manages to escape, but the monster heads upstairs and begins terrorizing his brother Pete (Tom DeFranco), and Pete's friends Ellen (Jean Tafler), Frankie (Richard Lee Porter), and Kathy (Karen Tighe).  Elsewhere, Charlie's aunt, grandmother, and a group of her elderly friends are attacked by a swarm of the hungry alien young.

With the action mostly indoors, the movie has a confined atmosphere, where the danger feels very close at hand.  This approach works well, as the alien is vicious, but very slow moving.  Despite a limited budget, director Douglas McKeown really does a great job of featuring the creature, and giving it a real sense of menace.  Discussing the movie on a commentary track, McKeown says that his first and only film (which was shot over an extended period of time, often on weekends), was largely a labor of love, as hardly anyone who worked on the project was paid.  The Deadly Spawn has very good production values, for a project shot on 16mm, and reportedly cost less than $20,000 to make.

With little experience, Charles George Hildebrandt may not have been the ideal choice for the role of hero, but he generally does a pretty good job of acting.  The Deadly Spawn was the only film appearance (so far) for Hildebrandt, Jean Tafler, Karen Tighe, and Richard Lee Porter.  The terrific cast, an iconic monster, great practical effects, dark humor, and some nasty kills, are among the elements that give the movie a certain unique charm.  The destruction of the monster is a little weak, but in a nice touch, the alien has the last word.

The DVD has a few extra features, including two commentary tracks that together, provide some really solid information about the production and the film's colorful history.  Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basket-Case/dp/B004D8KHMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basket Case</a>, this film demonstrates how in the 1980's, even with limited resources, it was possible to achieve some remarkable results in the horror genre.  The Deadly Spawn is not perfect, but it is genuinely scary at times, gets a lot right, and is a very admirable achievement for what it is.  Rating: 4.5 stars.",1331251200,,3351,5.123161764705882

I'm a huge fan of b-movie horror but I guess I was expecting too much. While the movie does have some excellent visual effects and fun gore it simply isn't enough to excuse a pretty boring story, forgettable characters with no development, and horrible sound quality that bugged me throughout the film.

Anyway, the movie mostly takes place inside of a house. It has more preliminary victims than most horror movies before they introduce the main cast. The house is invaded by fish/tadpole-like aliens, and a larger alien that has three mouths and two very frail limbs, but somehow manages to break down doors.

614362,4,6303219152,"Let me start by saying that this movie has been through one hell of a history, along with Last House on Dead End Street (even less budget, around 800-3000). Douglas Mckeown was smart enough to direct a movie with a few close friends and it became a HUGE hit after 23 years!. The characters live out their normal lives when the ultimate alien is living in their basement, unaware that they're being devoured one by one. Pete is the science geek, Ellen is the love interest (Hint: noone is safe!), Frankie is Pete's best friend, not very good on science, Kathy is a friend of theirs (famous line of the movie is said by her) and Charles, the horror fan. The main title music always gets my spine tingling, it's very chilling for a horror movie (Another Hint: Hollywood don't know how to make great composers). The reason why this movie is successful being a cult hit is because you can believe the situation they're in, they don't know anything about it until the last 25 minutes. It was only shot on 20,000 budget and the special effects are amazing (that's what all the money went to!) Heads dropping off, little Spawns swimming (they have their own personality, subtle hint), faces being ripped off and that's just the tip of the iceberg on the effects used. So, if you want some cheap entertainment thatwill give you the creeps, go for this title, you'll not be disappointed.

614363,3,6303219152,"Not much to say here.  Yes, this is a very low-budget film, even by low-budget standards.  Though this does hurt the film technically, the bigger concern comes in terms of the action i.e. it's a helluva a lot cheaper and faster to just shoot people standing around and talking than actually having anything happen.  The performances are amateurish, but likable enough for the material, but there just isn't anything there.  As usual, I never got terribly bored of the filler, but I got a bit antsy for sure, and in the end there just isn't as much alien action as their should be.  Still, what there is makes it all worth it.  The head alien-beast is pretty damn cool, I must admit.  A much classier design than I'd have expected for a film this cheap.  And the little baby eel spawn things, well they're just adorable.  I don't often use that word, but it's the only one that'll do.  The film is indeed quite gruesome, and though the execution is lacking, they make up for it in heart and volume.  But again, all the standing around and talking and lame AP Biology speak is fairly pointless, but it's worth the wait.

Worth a rental, anyway.

614446,4,6303219152,"I have now suffered through so many zero budget horror films that I'm starting to express serious reservations about watching any more of them. You know the sort of ""movies"" I'm talking about. Some dolt with a hankering to become a the next Quentin Tarentino borrows Mom and Dad's video camera, hires friends as ""actors,"" spends a grand total of a buck and a half on the budget, and shoots the thing in their basement. The editing technique consists of hacking together scenes with two VCRs. I've gone on and on about the greatness of the DVD revolution, how the arrival of this medium has allowed us to see films that haven't seen the light of day for decades, but there's a downside as well. The clamor for product, any product, to fill video store shelves means these shot on video crudfests find a distributor. Heck, the big chains carry a lot of these types of films nowadays. It wasn't always this way. Enter the 1983 movie ""The Deadly Spawn,"" a film that, if made today, would almost certainly be a shot on video production. Twenty plus years ago, however, even low budget filmmakers had to shoot on film.

And the ""Deadly Spawn"" IS low budget, painfully so. Yet the movie works. The picture begins with a sparking meteorite crashing to earth (We've never seen that before!) and disgorging a disgusting alien life form with murderous intent. Two campers who witness the fireworks are the first to fall prey to the beastie, although their deaths take place off camera so we don't see the alien right from the start. The creature then travels to a nearby house to take up residence in the dark, dank basement. Why? Because the alien needs a quiet place to spawn. Anyway, the family that lives in the house wakes up and begins their daily routine. Mom and Dad are the first ones up, and they're also the first ones to go down into the basement and die horribly. Their kids, Charles (Charles Hildebrandt) and Pete (Tom DeFranco), think nothing of their parents' absence. Chuck, a horror film fanatic with a love for makeup effects and magic tricks, is too busy cooking up new schemes to bother his Uncle Herb (John Schmerling), a psychiatrist worried about his nephew's grisly hobby, and his equally concerned Aunt Millie (Ethel Michelson). As for Pete, he's an astronomy nut looking forward to his friends coming over for a visit.

Charles eventually heads down into the basement and discovers the creature, which has three heads that consist of nothing but mouths packed full of rows upon rows of jagged teeth. Yuck! Even worse, the kid notices two supremely disturbing things. One, the alien is giving birth to what looks like hundreds of little wormlike creatures, and these too sport jagged teeth and an insatiable appetite. Two, and far more relevant, Charles notices the alien spawn feasting upon the ripped and torn face of one of his parents. Upstairs, Pete and a few of his friends discover one of the alien spawn and ponder over what they've found. Is it a worm? Or is it a new life form never before discovered? Pete and his pals are about to find out the hard way. To give the film a further sense of unfolding chaos, a gathering of old folks meeting nearby finds out in no uncertain terms that these little alien spawn play for keeps. How to stop the spread of the monsters? How to save humanity from the crawling terror in the basement? Charles steps up to save the world with a few little tricks and a whole mess of magic supplies, but will his efforts be enough to stop the evil? Prepare to blow chunks!

A fun movie, indeed, although it has problems one always finds in low budget productions. The difference here is that the movie occasionally turns the faults into a force for good. For example, the acting won't win any awards, no doubt about it. I cringed at some of the lines and situations in the movie. But the leaden dialogue and campy performances--see the old ladies screeching during the alien attack--actually helps rather than hurts the film. You're laughing even as you're grossed out by the onscreen carnage. One difficulty inherent in any low budget horror flick usually revolves around the special effects, something I'm proud to say isn't a problem here. The monster looks great, and the gore effects are truly stomach churning. I already mentioned the face chewing, but we also get eyeball violence, decapitations, and other cheer worthy carnage. It's obvious the filmmakers dumped practically every dime they had into making the alien and her (I guess it's a her since she's spawning) vicious attacks look as convincing as possible. Another wise choice involved limiting most of the film to the action unfolding in the house. Doing so gave the movie a real heavy claustrophobic feel that works well for a horror movie.

According to an article I read some time ago, Synapse Films spent more money than the movie cost to prepare the print and compile the supplements for the DVD. After listening to and watching the plethora of extras, I believe it. We get two commentary tracks, one with producer Ted Bohus and the other with writer-director Doug McKeown and other people associated with the production. Cast and crew bios, a trailer, behind the scenes stuff, outtakes, audition footage, a comic book treatment, and an alternate opening sequence round out the bonus materials. It's great to see a cult classic, and ""The Deadly Spawn"" is definitely cult classic material, receive such regal treatment on DVD. All horror film fans need to check this movie out at some point.

Synapse has spared no expense in bringing the awsome Deadly Spawn out from its dank, dark basement and onto your television in all its fetid glory. Never has the Spawn looked so good. What is nice to see is that the transfer, although sharp has managed to strike a balance between cleaning up the blips and bleeding colours but still retaining the grimy and dark tone of the film. As well, the DVD features some cool extra's including a comic style prequel which was really cool and would make a movie unto itself. Of course, the prequel idea would require a budget, which the original certainly did not have. This makes it all the more amazing Mr Bohus. and gang delivered the film they did on $25,000 measly bucks.

It starts in the woods as two campers on a hill see something fall from the sky. Is it a ping pong ball? Nope, its a meteor carrying its deadly occupant to earth. Of course, they have to investigate and if the spawn was an athiest, he surely grew tired of the one guys repeated invokations of god. He is quickly dispatched, his flesh tearing with all the sound of so much styrofoam. From there, the creature takes up residence in a basement where it becomes an unwelcome uncle Tom, wreaking havoc on the memebers of the house.

This film is a lot of fun, gore and good old fashioned monster goodness rolled into one. The creature is a throwback to the days before CGI ruined the breed.

This movie is also relentless. There is a scene where the little boy is in the basement watching his mom(forgive me if i'm wrong, it might have been his sister, aunt, lover,etc) being eaten. Her skull is lying there with goop all over it. Classic scene. This movie also has a pretty neat ending. Nothing mind blowing but i didn't expect it.

The DVD even comes packed with plenty of extras which include quite a few picture galleries, a comic-book style prequel, audition footage where you not only see people who didn't make it into the film, but you see cast members trying out for different rolls, even an alternate opening.  But best of all is the wonderfully clear print of the film.

A meteor crashes near a pair of really bad actors camping in the woods.  They investigate and are quickly made into alien chow before the opening credits.  The beastie then moves to the basement of a nearby house.  Torrential rain may have been a coincidence during filming, but it added nicely.  The houses inhabitants include a family of four and a visiting aunt and uncle.  The parents try to set out early on a trip.  The key people are really the kids.  The older science and fact oriented brother, and the younger, monster-obsessed brother.  One denies the existence of monsters and aliens even when experienced first hand while the other never believed they could be real but is well equipped for understanding the situation.

But the monster in the basement is not all (and no it doesn't stay down there).  The creature is spawning and countless smaller aliens begin to infiltrate the house and the neighborhood looking for treats to eat.  Eventually the locals and authorities get involved and work to wipe out the threat (sort of like in the end of Night of the Living Dead).  But the ending is one that is unexpected unless you have gone through the extras before watching the film.

There's the typical high school kids who become victims,but before they do, they transmit the delicious feeling of blowing off class and hanging with friends on a grey rainy day. The alien invasion isn't as important as having a good time indoors with yourself or your friends, and I think people who put this movie down neglect to absorb this essence that pulses from this terrific monster film.",991958400,2,932,4.520710059171598

Looking back at it from the year 2000 and reading many letters from people that remembered it as kids...maybe it's not so bad  after all. Just imagine a computer-generated Spawn 200 feet tall! NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT BUY THE UK VERSION OF THIS FILM. IT IS A BOOTLEG! A REAL UK release will be coming soon. Thanks!--Ted",953251200,4,410,4.394736842105263
614534,4,6303219152,"I saw this movie way back in the day, when I was like eight. Oh my gosh, that's when EVERYONE saw it hahahaha. Anyways, the gruesomeness of this movie is awesome. If you are into blood and guts and gore everywhere, this  movie is the movie for you. It's a great slaughter movie with aliens,  that's what those are, right; who slaughter a bunch of people. Acting is  something you shouldn't look forward to, but the guts and gore glorey  really make up for it. After a while, it just looks like the movie makers  filled a bucket full of cranberry juice and threw it everywhere. Tasty! I  gave this movie a 4 just because of the acting, anything less would be  uncivilized :)",946598400,2,673,4.379032258064516
614535,4,6303219152,"I saw this movie when I was like eight, and it made me laugh so hard that I cried.  This is one of the movies that any horror/sci-fi collection would not be complete without.  This is the campy fun that gets aired at two in  the morning.  Fans of the genre really should check this film out, they  won't be dissapointed, no Oscar material here but then who cares, it is  100% fun.",945907200,,380,4.136986301369863

7842296,5,6303219152,"There's no denying that this movie is cheesy, and sometimes a tad bit boring unfortunately, but the deadly spawn puppets are AMAZING! In fact, for a low budget film I'd say the special effects as a whole are downright mind-blowing. I can totally understand why The Deadly Spawn is considered a b-movie classic. There are a few long-winded dialog scenes that only exist to stretch the screen time... but if you can look past those you're bound to have a good time with this flick. 5 stars!",1509148800,,488,4.620689655172414

7842300,3,6303219152,Bah. Too much bad acting mixed with some moments. I should be kinder. This is a case of a true indy film catching a little wind in its sails. I knew about it from cult chatter. That means it managed success.,1478649600,,207,4.073170731707317

7842303,5,6303219152,"Total 80s low budget awesomeness!!!
First off i enjoyed many of the positive reviews here..you people rock and totally get it!!..I jumped on this when Synapse released the dvd in the early 2000s..now im gonna buy the blu ray since i finally gave into the blu ray madness..this is what i really dig in my horror movies..especially from my 80s youth..impress me with very little money and a group of unknown actors..and this movie delivers in spades!!
I absolutely hate Hollywood today and cgi effects!!!..My dvd collection is huge and full of these type movies..Synapse..Shriek Shriek Show..Blue Underground..Anchor Bay/Image..Code Red..Shout Factory..Arrow Video..I absolutely love these companies!!!...They brought back all of my faves and im grabbing them all before they fade away one day..I don't care about oscars and award type movies or remakes..these movies are what i live for.
What they did with Deadly Spawn was superb..the story was decent..the gore and creatures were alot of fun and totally cool..No name and people next door type actors make for a realistic type feel..just a fun movie all the way around..one i never get tired of watching..the action is fast paced..no sleep moments at all and moves at a fast pace..sad movies will never be made like this again..im glad to have grown up in this era..the youth today will never understand how much fun it was..there are few out there who get it though..anyway..if you are an 80s horror/gore hound who loves being impressed with what people can do with little money and entertain the hell out of you with zero cgi..definitely pick this one up!!..Also pick up the somewhat of a sequel spin off from the same people titled Metamorphosis..The Alien Factor..also very enjoyable!!.Long live the horror genre of the 80s and to all you other fans on the same page as i..love all of you..some of the reviews and opinions here were really enjoyable!!",1455840000,6,1906,5.034810126582278
