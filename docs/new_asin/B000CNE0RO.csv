2466411,5,B000CNE0RO,"This series was incredible! I was amazed by the characters and the storylines! EVERY  week I rushed home from work on Wednesday nights to catch the show and usually there was a rerun of one of the past shows I would watch too. I HATE the direction television has gone in the last few years. I refuse to watch the crap they call ""reality"" t.v. and ANYTHING with a title like ""Desperate Housewives"" offends me. EVERYTIME a truly quality show like Over There or Joan of Arcadia gets cancelled it makes me furious. I write letters to the networks but it never seems to do any good. I have talked to soldiers who are currently serving in Iraq who LOVED this series. Every detail may not be exact but they said it is incredibly true to what they are dealing with. The characters on the homefront were amazingly true to life also. I just can't rave enough about what a wonderful job the actors did with this show! Erik Palladino stole the show and my heart! But ALL the actors were fantastic! I personally loved the theme song. Many of the stories were about things I have read in the news actually happened. I think the only reason this show didn't have better ratings is that it was badly Underadvertised! I never watch FX so the only way I heard about it was because my husband was channel surfing and stopped on FX for a minute. BELIEVE me if more people knew about it more would have watched it. I am so hoping another network will pick this amazing show up. BRAVO to the cast and writers!!!!!",1136592000,6,1491,4.382671480144404
2466412,5,B000CNE0RO,"We'd all like to know what's happening in Iraq. But we can't. Unless you're all seeing, you can't see inside every mission; every soldiers heart, every civilians struggle. Our imaginations are all we truly have. OVER THERE gives fuel to our imagine. So we can REASON for ourselfs. And see what pain and honor feels like.

people who don't like this show either can't feel or can't think

they're into more pointless things than war",1136332800,3,431,4.733333333333333
2466413,5,B000CNE0RO,"I'm a Desert Storm Vet.  I liked Jarhead, both the book and the movie.  But I know other Desert Storm Vets who hated them.  I have more than a few friends and relatives who are either in Iraq right now or are home from Iraq.  The ones who are home who saw this show agreed that some of the tactics were wrong and not all the jargon was correct, but they were so appreciative that someone finally seemed to nail how they felt and what they went through.  I really liked this show.  The characters reminded me of men and women I served with.  No, not all soldiers act like these characters.  I was a soldier, I was deep in Iraq in Desert Storm.  We were soldier's, but we were still people with personalities and lives.  As collective as war may sound each soldier will have a different experience.  Soldiers who served right next to me will have a completely different story to tell you.  To dimiss this series because it lacked exact details is a disservice to the fine writing and acting on the show.  I found it vitally important that someone had the guts to make this show.  It seems this war just keeps going on and on and it moves from front page news to 4th page news.  People seem to care more about whether Nick and Jessica are together more than how many American soldiers were killed in Iraq.  ""Over There"" at least took this war and the plight of our soldiers and put it back in the forefront of people's minds.  I know many vets who like this show a lot.  If you find this show doesn't represent your experience or tell your story, then get out a pen and tell us your story.  Seriously, I wish more vets would put their stories out there in one way or another.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",1136073600,15,1714,4.247678018575852
2466414,4,B000CNE0RO,"I accidently ran into this show while doing the usual end-of-day channel surf. It was absolutely thrilling and engaging. I have no idea how realistic the show was, as I have never been in the service or Iraq. However, the characters seemed real and struck me as kids that you'd see working at the local fast food joint or gas station, but wearing fatiques and carrying weapons. And that seems to be to be the difference between war and real life -- the uniform and the tools (in this case automatic weapons) empower everyday individuals with extraordinary powers.

Also, Erik Palladino was fantastic. I hated his character in ER, but here he showed his acting chops. I loved this show and sad to hear FX cancelled it, but 'hello' make it easier for your audience to find your shows by playing them at the same time, same day every week.",1135641600,8,836,4.573333333333333
2466415,1,B000CNE0RO,"I first saw this show within days of returning to the states after a tour of duty in Iraq.  Me and other guys in my unit couldn't believe what garbage this is.  Army life in Iraq is NOT like what was portrayed in this show.  Real soldiers don't act like that.  The equipment was wrong, the tactics were wrong.  Worst of all, the dialogue was all wrong.  I'm glad that FX canceled the show.

It is clear that the script writers of ""Over There"" didn't do their homework.  ""Over There"" is not the real deal.  I suggest checking out the book ""Jarhead"" (Anthony Swofford) or seeing the recently relesed movie of the same name.  Although it covers Desert Shield/Desert Storm from a Marine's perspective, it accurately portrays the behavior and emotions of enlisted soldiers even in todays conflict in Iraq.",1135382400,21,800,4.65
2466416,4,B000CNE0RO,"I was very excited for the premier of Over There. I love how FX really takes risks with their programs and Rescue Me, The Shield, and Nip/Tuck are three of television's finest shows. I knew Over There was going to raise a few eyebrows and it dealt with a very sensitive topic but the show was very respectful of the troops in Iraq.

Over There was the first show to depict the U.S. in a current war. That was enough to get the conservatives on their case but if you watch the show you will get a feeling of how hard it is to be ""over there"". The cast were very believable characters and the writing was very good. Obviously the show couldn't really be in Iraq but the set looked a lot like Iraq. Over There dealt with humanizing topics and it was a treat to watch.

Here's why I don't think Over There was right for television. Its ratings were not that bad for a rookie cable show but FX was under a lot of fire so they crossed it off their list of problems. Despite critical praise I don't think enough people were ready to handle the war fictionalized but it's a shame. I'm glad that we can relive the thirteen adventures through this DVD and it is a steal for the price Amazon lists. If you missed it when it first aired, then this is a great way to see the entire series.",1134518400,98,1276,4.161943319838056
2466417,4,B000CNE0RO,"First, I'm an American, living abroad, and watched all these episodes on local TV. But, I was so captivated, I wanted to review this series. I fully agree that the biggest hit of this series was Eric Palladino. The look on his face in the next to last episode when he deals with the organiser of a local orphanage was so hauntingly real, it still echos in my mind. The group of soliders seemed very real and shows well done scripting and acting. But, yes, the storylines of ""back home"" excluding dim's alcoholic wife were marginal. This is a well made series that is the darker and personal side of soliders' lives; It's just a shame we don't get a chance to see where it might of gone if the production had been granted a second season.",1134518400,7,737,4.386861313868613
2466418,3,B000CNE0RO,"This was sort of a weird series in terms of what works and what didn't. For this review I'm going to bullet-point some things.

What Worked:

1. Erik Palladino- The ER alum deserves special recognition. He STOLE the series. He was really that good here.

2. The production value was terrific. I don't know where they were filming at, but they did an outstanding job designing the sets and props. EVERYTHING looked totally authentic.

3. The story-lines in Iraq did a great job of holding my interest. Granted, I have absolutely no idea how ""real"" any of it is or how much is ""Hollywood"", but they never lost my attention and I was never inclined to fast-forward anything.

4. The interplay between and characters in the unit seems completely natural and flows wonderfully. I totally believe it as I'm watching the fire-team get to know one another and develop relationships with each other.

What Didn't:

1. Almost everything on the home front. With the lone exception of Dumphy's alcoholic wife, I just can't seem to generate even the smallest amount of interest in ANYTHING going on at home.

2. The role of the First Lieutenant. First it was ""Mad Cow"" then ""Underpants""; the role of the ""Idiot First Lieutenant"" is the ""red-shirt ensign"" of the series. The production team would have done themselves a favor by filling the role for more then a four or five episode story arc.

3. The closing 'Over There' anthem. Simply put, I hate that song. I also can't stand that I'm forced to listen to it because it's running over the last five minutes of the episode. Unfortunately for me though, Chris Gerolmo wrote and performs it. It's something he's clearly proud of and he wasn't going to cut his own song out.

A lot of the problems I felt like the series had, I chalked up to this being a first year show still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't. Absolutely none of the issues I had were anything that couldn't (pretty easily) be fixed or corrected.  It simply needed a little more time to find it's way a bit and gain some polish, the same way any new show would.

It's really a shame that FX canceled this after one year.  From what I read, the ratings were awful; but I felt there was so much room to grow that if a little more patience was shown this could have been a real winner.

It's too bad FX could hang in there a bit longer ...",1134345600,58,2354,4.482435597189696
2466419,5,B000CNE0RO,Great,1472083200,,5,5.0
2466420,1,B000CNE0RO,"Formulaic and unrealistic. It plays almost like propaganda (hot dogs, apple pie, and high school football). The battle scenes in the first episode, which is all I will watch, are ridiculous, e.g., charging at the enemy when they have mortar fire backing them up. Charging the enemy at all, really, which never happens. The last time that happened was WWI, and it doesn't happen now because of how that worked out in WWI, that and technology has replaced the need of 'charging.'  The squad had 40mm on their rifles, but never fire one, why? The back up squad in a humvee fired one, but that was it. The SAW gunner brags about how he one shotted an enemy combatant in the head--really, with a SAW machine gun? What was he doing sniping, not that he would hit anyone in the head with a SAW anyway, which is a complete misuse of the gun in the first place. The reason we know it wasn't a luck shot from a wayward bullet is because we see him make the shot, aim, fire. You don't use the SAW that way--ever. And, the extra clean uniforms. Yeah, right. Last, the order was given to pull the trucks over onto the side of the road, off of the asphalt. Why? Oh, so they could get blown up with a land mine. Realistically, that would never have happened, as the order to simply ""STOP"" would have been given, never to ""pull over"" off of the asphalt road. Written on about the 8th grade level, and could have been an enlistment propaganda tool. But for an entertainment level series, horrid.

If you want to now how it really goes down, watch the docudramas called ""Restrepo"" and ""The Fighting Season"" here on Amazon. Filmed with an embedded camera crew and with real soldiers, but produced in a drama sort of way. If you want a good war flick done Hollywood, watch ""Black Hawk Down"" and the ultimate war story, ""Band of Brothers.""",1470787200,,1818,4.440119760479042

2466441,1,B000CNE0RO,"This is easily the worst show I have ever seen.
Here is the quick breakdown of FXs blatant attempt to make a quick buck off the war.
Paper thin characters are scooped up from various ghettos all over the US and dropped onto the front-line of Iraq (which doesn't exist as it is an insurgency and therefore has no front line). Given they have absolutely no training they start doing things they have seen in bad movies like, give each other stupid nick-names, run into the open during a firefight, take cover behind things that won't even slow a bullet down, and call in airstrikes on buildings they are standing next to. There doesn't appear to be any command structure and no one has an MOS. In one episode the main characters are truck drivers attacking a fixed position, in the next they are special forces interrogators. This platoon of 7 people (?) just wander through the war doing ... things.",1434412800,,898,4.583850931677019

It didn't make it past 1 season....I imagine people weren't ready to know on a weekly basis what it was like ""over there"" --their sons and daughters and husbands and wives were still ""over there"" and some still are.  This show follows the development of personal grit & character as a brand new unit of recruits goes to Iraq.  It also follows the struggles of their loved ones at home in their absence.  Each episode wraps up a war related dramatic event, and highlights the chronic struggles of a different family member back home.  I hear from those who've been ""over there"" that this is pretty realistic, as tv goes--it really reminds you that each soldier is just a person with their own history and values and moral code...and then illustrates pretty keenly how they all get smooshed into the regulations that are Army.  You watch as they mold into a cohesive unit in order to survive mentally and physically the unimaginable split second decisions that they are making daily, and as they learn first hand the blessing of a good leader or the curse of foolish frivolous despot with rank.",1412121600,2,1197,4.591549295774648

2466497,4,B000CNE0RO,"I never saw this series when it was first aired probably because I never watch FX.  The special effects/photography were good, and most of the characters were believable.  It's definitely worth seeing.  The ""back home"" scenes didn't add much to the series because it seemed disconnected to their spouses ""over there.""  Perhaps there wasn't enough character development for those at home probably since the series was so short.  Thirteen episodes for one season is too short.

There were many touching scenes, believable plots, and fairly realistic characters.  More seasons could have improved the show and fixed some of the flaws.  The dialog could have been improved in some episodes.  I got the sense that not enough military and Iraq war research was done for the show.

The screaming sergeant didn't seem interested in supporting his troops at the beginning then improved toward the end.  It's like the writers were learning as they go.  Also, they overused ""soldier"" too much.  I would think unit commanders and sergeants would know their own soldier's names.  I never could figure out who was who because they rarely called the soldiers by their names.

I never heard of females being on the front lines in combat unless they were separated from their unit.  It was never clear where the two women came from.  About midway, it was mentioned they were mechanics and I never could figure out where the rest of their unit was or why they didn't try to get back to their unit.  I think the addition of the women in an infantry unit was just to boost ratings and wishful thinking on the part of the writers.

The squad at the center of the series seemed rather small and the only ones fighting the Iraq war.  They could have used some extras.

The theme song over the last few minutes of the show could have been scrapped.  It was terrible and like someone else said something more epic could have been created.  The documentary in the extras said the show got it's name from that song.

The TV series Tour of Duty was much better as was Band of Brothers.  I think Over There was trying to be another Tour of Duty with a different war.  It was brave of the producers to do a series on a then-current war and that's probably why it didn't make it.

Overall it was pretty good for a lower-budget production.  I was going to give it three stars, but thought there were some high points to the series.",1357689600,,2399,4.607565011820331
2466498,5,B000CNE0RO,"This series was a magnificent view of some of the struggles and hardships that many Soldiers, Airmen, Marines and Sailors experienced while deployed to various nations throughout recent American history. Of course all of these things wouldn't have happened to one single squad but it would be far too expensive to hire and train new actors for every episode. It came out very early on in the war which was a bold move on Steven Bochco's part and for that I give him kudos. Unfortunately that was a huge contributing factor for there only being one season.

to his fine work. OVER*THERE is no exception. It should have lasted for more than 13 episodes. It should still be running. My guess is our PC monitors, both Left and Right apparatchiks, for different reasons, couldn't take the edgy  renditions of those ghastly Mideast battlefields.

For the Left, it was messy and 'way to scary for Network TV. Liberal would faint. Case in point, a woman US soldier seeking to relieve herself in a ditch when an El Qaeda soldier stumbles onto her and . . . (SPOILER DELETION). Well, too edgy for viewers who haven't been in combat.

For the Right, too real. Conservative would write letters. The compromises, conflicted soldiers feelings, images of posturing politicians. So-vivid bloodshed, mutilations - 'Way too intense and perhaps thought to be questioning all aspects of these nothing-black-and-white wars.

2466519,2,B000CNE0RO,"I bought this dvd because of the good ratings and low price and I'm suprised at how bad it is. Maybe that's because I just watched Band of Brothers and my expectations are too high. After the first two discs I lost interest. Here's why.

 Casting- Dude from Onyx? Zack from saved by the bell? Recognizable faces draw attention to a show but that's usually when they're good actors that people want to see.

  The acting is mostly bad from everyone, the dialoge doesn't help either. Every time a seargent or officer speaks he is yelling with a fake tough guy voice, saying God d#@n every other word because it's regular cable and they can't really cuss.

 The fighting/combat looks fake and unrealistic. One scene has soldiers closely spaced behind a berm with wave after wave of Arab fighters running out in the open  towards them from 50 feet away firing from the hip. That might work in a video game but not here.

  With a tv budget they can't film in the middle east and it's obvious. The background scenery always looks like California with green hills, nicely paved roads and GO95 compliant utility lines.

These are the reasons the show got bad ratings and was cancelled. The good reviews baffle me.

2466534,2,B000CNE0RO,"I have only seen four episodes so far, but from what I have seen this is a terrible series. It is overdramatized, unrealistic, exaggerated, etc. It focuses on a 3rd Infantry Division supply squad that somehow manages to be involved in every possible mission: prisoner transfer and guarding, ""secret"" interrogations, frontline combat, road block duty, and every once in a while actual supplying.

The members of the squad never stop arguing with one another, even breaking out into knife fights. The unit is always in a situation where they are under attack and have no support available. While there are some engagements in Iraq where units were outnumbered, it usually didn't take more than a few hours - or less - to reinforce the unit with additional units and fire support. And this usually applies to an advanced platoon or patrol squad - again, not a logistics unit.

It is telling that in this film there is no sense of time - is it April 2003, 2005 - 2007? The insurgency and combat operations varied by year.

I would contrast this with Generation Kill, where there was a balance between combat, drama, and back stories. Over There doesn't even seem to have a commanding officer anywhere in the vicinity when problems occur.

I hope that a better series comes out in the future about the conflict in Iraq. There are undoubtedly many fine, true stories that such a series could be based on; and instead of choosing a random, fictional supply unit why not a real combat company?

It's telling that many of the decent, longer shows about conflicts are company based - such as Generation Kill and Band of Brothers. It gives more potential for stories, characters, and there is enough action across a company over time to portray. An individual squad is less likely to be part of every company or battalion action.",1262304000,6,1818,4.758730158730159

2466537,5,B000CNE0RO,"I don't think I've ever reviewed a series while I'm still watching it, but this show is that good. It's a fiercely intelligent, uncompromising piece of work. It shocks me something of this quality wasn't renewed for a second season. It must have been too raw for audiences, too emotionally real.

The emotions are complex, too--just when you like a character, they do something human and challenge your assumptions. I've rarely if ever seen a television show where the characters are less like cartoons. The one-dimensional characterisation of the CSI-like shows are put to shame by ""Over There.""

An episode like ""Suicide Rain"" is like good theater--set mostly in one room, the focus of the drama can shift in a heartbeat, and your expectations keep getting displaced. That's probably the key characteristic of this series--every time you predict what will happen (the usual television thing), the opposite does.

It's possible this may be the best thing the Bochcos and Chris Gerolmo have ever done and ever will do. It's a terrible shame it only lasted for a year, but at least we have a full season. Don't miss it; it's one of the best shows in a long time.",1257724800,3,1161,4.824120603015075

2466541,5,B000CNE0RO,"OK, let's get the bad over with first. Yes, the show was filmed in locales that don't look exactly like Iraq. Yes, there were a lot of little things that weren't quite right like how soldiers talked to each other and so forth. Yes, it's a bit of a stretch to imagine that this one squad would have weekly adventures of all types and be sent into some of these situations without any additional backup or support. However, all that aside, this is a pretty decent show about the early part of the action in Iraq. I think the way to view the thing is that it's sort of a montage of all the sorts of issues that came up. Sure one squad might not have done ALL of these things in Iraq, but all of these types of things did happen. The series starts out kind of rough, but you soon get to know and be interested in the characters and as it progresses, some of the annoying little errors in ""Army stuff"" aren't a big deal anymore. If there's one thing the series kind of misses a little, it is the big lack of security and reliable institutions that plagued the whole operation right from the start on the Iraqi side. While this comes through sometimes, the show tends to focus more on ""bad guys"" which, in retrospect, were probably an effect of the chaos more than a cause of it.

The writers did an excellent job with the script for this series. The sets were also very believable and authentic. Arab actors very well played the Iraqi people. The filming must have been done in an Arab country, but I'm only guessing. It really felt like you are in Iraq. Much of the events portrayed in the series are actual events that made the news, and for this reason it was very controversial. Reading about real events and actually seeing them acted out are two completely different experiences. The series will re-enforce feelings you have about the Iraqi war, regardless on which side you are on, and whether you are for or against the war.

And O yes, I loved the theme song of this series!

This TV series does not glamorize war, but rather portrays the horrors of war as viewed from all sides. I wish there were more episodes, or a second season. But from what I have heard, it was pulled off the air for its controversial content. It seems some people in government don't want us to watch this series! A little off the subject, I highly recommend the book, `The End of America', by Naomi Wolf. Things are not the way they used to be in the United States, and people, whether writers, film makers, or journalists, are not free anymore to express themselves without the fear of being persecuted. The book will give you insight on why this TV series had such a short lifespan.

2466587,5,B000CNE0RO,"I found out about this series only just recently.  I briefly remember hearing about it back when, but never did see it.

I just saw it for the first time and all I can say is, what a shame that we won't have other seasons of this series.  Incredibly powerful and moving.

I would not necessarily call this ""realistic"", but more like ""gripping"" and ""dramatic"".  Let's face it, the primary purpose of this series is drama and they have to exaggerate some things in order to create an artistic product.

Some things will have you groaning if you are a military realist.  For instance, using mortars to blow up speeding cars.  Yeah, right.  The episode where the fat guy from Band of Brothers plays an intel spook (who later turns out to be a military intelligence colonel) started off very badly, but managed to redeem itself by the end.

All of the story lines were believable, if only by a thread.

There is an overall sad and somber tone to the series.  And other than a character who loses his leg early (Bo), the rest of the cast stays intact for the entire first season.  They do throw away a couple of lieutenants, but nobody that you're supposed to care about.

I found that this did manage to capture and portray enough of the nuances of military life that I found myself suspending disbelief enough to really, really enjoy the series.

Some military folks have been quoted as hating this series.  Others have said they liked it.  I think you have to take it from the perspective that this is fictionalized drama, not a documentary.  I never deployed to Iraq, but I have served as both an NCO in the Army and an Officer in the Navy.

So, if they did a good enough job for me, they probably have done a good enough job for anybody willing to give this a chance.

Some moments are very memorable.  The death of a little boy, the bronze star that one character receives.  (I'm trying not to put too many spoilers in this review.)

By the end, the only negative emotion I felt was frustration that the story ended where it did.  I really wanted to know what became of the soldiers.  Where did they go?  Did they get through their tours?

I thought the characters were compelling, and that was the best part of the series.

As a separate note, currently, this is available for $28.  I am honestly considering buying 10 or 20 copies to give out as gifts.  For 13 episodes, I can't imagine a better bargain.

Strongly recommended at any price, but especially at THIS price.  For those who love military movies, this will not disappoint.",1207526400,,2535,4.467248908296943
2466588,5,B000CNE0RO,"An absolutely fine production that attempted to show what it might have been like to fight in Iraq during the early days of the anti-occupation insurgency.  There was some concern from veterans of the Iraq war that elements of the plot lines, or specific aspects of the depiction of the fighting, were not accurate and I am hardly able to comment on those concerns.  All I can say is that the thrust of the show seemed to bring home what was generally consistent with news reports in 2003-2005.  The actors who play the key roles are very good and the arc of the story line over the 13 episodes kept me coming back.  I don't think the intent of the producer or director was a polemical one--it's not ""pro"" or ""anti"" the US invasion, though some of the episodes are hard edged and difficult to watch, but then any accurate depiction of war is hard to watch.  Good production values.  Fine characters portrayed by great actors in nuanced performances.  Solid screenplays.  Realistic interactions among the soldiers in the platoon, between the ""grunts"" and their officers, between the soldiers and their families at home--and the human beings (Americans and Iraqi civilians) caught in an impossible situation.  I think it only made it through one season because the country wasn't yet ready to see some version of the war played out each week on its TVs--it can be painful to watch but it is an honest attempt to portray how ""war is hell"", a lesson that each generation needs to learn in its own way.",1203292800,,1497,4.661596958174905

Not all the characters are immediately likable, much less admirable, but they all turn out to have value.  The series suffered because the anti-war crowd saw the series as pro-war and the pro-war crowd saw it as anti-war.  Both sides were looking through a bowl of Jello -- dimly.

The characters are beautifully written and acted.  Every character convinced me of his or her integrity.  This was one of many elements, especially the air of gritty reality, that reminded me of NYPD BLUE.  As well it should, since many of the people who made NYPD BLUE one of the best shows on network television also made this series.  Ironically, there are guest spots by NYPD BLUE alumni and it seems having been in the earlier series was a death warrant.

One of my favorite episodes is one in which an Iraqi prisoner is being interrogated.  I suspect that the gear being worn by the Americans is used to make them seem less human, more a machine, and it gave that extra touch of tension that made the episode so powerful.

The writers and directors have learned what someone had to teach me about writing -- showing the telling detail, the little touch that makes a scene complete.

They are very picky (and rightfully so) that if a movie or show depicting our military is not totally accurate, they usually won't like it.

I am actually ""over there"" and the show does depict some realism which can be somewhat dramatic but it is true.  Infidelity, incompetent officer lesdership, lack of situational awareness, and competent noncommissioned officers are real aspects of war that these soldiers have to make split second decisions about.  This smal squad seems to be plagued with  terrible officers. When they lose one they get another.  The officer/NCO relationships as depicted in this show is torent and sends the message that officers and ncos are constantly against one another but never shows the opposite spectrum when there is a good officer/NCO relationship. As far as females roles in this series, It seems to be a little extreme. 2 logistics females, embedded with an infantry squad is the only major thing I see wrong with this show.  This is a very unpopular and uncommon occurance in the theater of operartions and this show makes it look like it's normal. Viewers get a false impression of how females are being assigned or tasked and their roles.  Other than that it's a good show and I would like to see season 2.",1173139200,4,1297,4.841628959276018

The show is bleak- maybe too bleak but it does grab your attention. Even the stories at home are handled well- esp. the one with a soilder who loses a limb. The one that fails a bit is about a lady soilder who goes AWOL - think it was put in cause some Fox exec. wanted a pretty girl to show more skin.

We don't know why some of the viewers did not like the show, but we thought it was great.  In a single season, they (the producer and the director) did a wonderful job trying to show what our Soldiers might go through:  Fratricide, Wounded Soldier, Death, Family Issues Back Home, etc...  We felt that the show pretty much stayed neutral.  Granted, there were some parts we disagreed or did not like, but we understand those are to spice things up for the show.  Also, the appearance of the Soldiers was decent:  Support elements carrying M16, uniform appearance, etc...  Overall, the show had good stories, excellent characters, and great actions.

Everyone who says that this show does not accurately depict the US military obviously is not in the military or holds a position in the military that does not routinely work with the field soldiers and marines. The characters were pretty much right on you can spend time with any group of freedom fighters and see multiple personalities similar to those depicted in this show, sometimes even worse. I am sorry but that is fact while we do our best in the military to present only the best we have to offer there are individuals who are not so perfect...not to mention this was aired on FX and not discovery or history channel. I would have to say it was a great show and did give every citizen who wanted a peek into military life ""Over There"" an 90% accurate portrayal what it was like and a 100% enjoyable show if this is the type shows you like.

2466651,5,B000CNE0RO,"I wrote most of this review not realizing that what I was submitting a review for what was merely the Pilot Episode-- The Battle Begins.  But in truth my comments were directed toward the entire 13 episodes, which appeared on FX beginning in the summer of 2005 and running (whenever FX decided to put it on) until November that same year.

  To my mind, this was one of the best shows to appear on television in quite some time... but then it was dropped.  Now that the ""West Wing"" is gone, are there any evening dramas on (besides ""24"")on television?

-----Here's in a slightly altered version is what I posted re: the pilot (but it applies to the series even more so),

 When the hype machine began running for ""Over There"" in the Fall of 2005, I feared the worst: a knee jerk, jingoistic portrayal of Iraq II.  So you can imagine my surprise when I watched the first episode-- still a skeptic-- and found myself geting involved with the characters, each an individual, each flawed, each heroic at times, each in service for his/her own reason, serving for reasons that weren't always noble or clear, but serving and becoming part of a disparate, dysfuntional family, in a world of kill or be killed, where the only certainty was uncertainty.

  We were hooked after the first episode, and came back week in, week out, to watch with empathy and horror as the season unfolded, following each of the members of this unit-- and their families back home.  It is a strange war, with satellite phones and internet video mail making it possible to stay connected-- somewhat-- while fighting heat, boredom, terrorist, land mines, etc.  This is a war where you can be emailing your spouse or family one instant, then stop, saying, ""Gotta log off now, they want to send us out on a mission.""  For those back home, waiting for your next message, it has to be extremely hard.  Waiting and wondering.

  It was gripping, real, filled with ambiguity, terror, heroism, self-doubt, hard choices, and no clear cut sense why we are there, what the Big Mission is, and worst,  who the enemy really is. Sunni, Shiite, Kurd?  Person seeking aid, or suicide bomber with billowing robes?  Is that a child playing beside the road, or a lookout, signalling to a bomber ahead?

  In a just world, ""Over There"" would be back for another season.  It will remain one of the most memorable depictions of modern war-- at the boots on the ground level-- you will see.  It shows that there are casualties amongst the locals, their families, and children, and the families left back home to worry about their soldiers Over There.  War is hell.  Not just for hte enlisted.  There is collateral damage to Iraqi civilians, non-coms, contractors, families at home, marriages torn apart, relationships strained, hopes and ambitions drained, plans put on hold (or destroyed).  Really.  But it is not black and white.

  We love ""Over There,"" despite all my initial skepticism and doubt.  See it.  If you are not hooked after two episodes, it isn't for you.  But if you are, you will stay with it to the end, and want it-- but not the war-- to go on.",1148601600,3,3111,4.650735294117647

2466653,5,B000CNE0RO,"I'm a soldier curently serving my second tour in Iraq. I first notice this show around Sept 05 shortly before I deployed for my second tour. This show is ""The Truth"". What your seeing before your eyes is exactly what's going on. How these charactors are acting, is the exact same way my soldiers are. One guy made a statement saying how these soldiers are punks, prostitutes, lesbians, etc... Well not every soldier in the U.S army has a perfect background. Most of these soldiers are coming from gangs, the streets, high school dropouts, or whatever. I think the producer did an outstanding job with this series, and I can't wait for the next season.

2466654,5,B000CNE0RO,"Take it from someone who's been there and done that:  this show should never have even tried to portray soldiers as ""perfect little Americans"".  We are, after all, only human.  We all have human faults and weaknesses and I applaud the show's creators for allowing fans to see that.  We also all have our moments of nobility and sacrifice.  Just because the characters in a TV series don't live up to someone's expectations of what a soldier should be (in their estimable opinion) doesn't mean that what we did over there should be valued any less.  Just because a TV show depicts the less than perfect life of the average joe doesn't make his sacrifices less important.  That conflict of the public's expectation of perfect citizen soldier and hero with the reality of a scared kid, fresh out of the city (or country) is what makes for great TV.

From the standpoint of a ""recovering Iraq-aholic"":  watching these shows was cathartic.  Every emotion I went through was covered in this short series.  I cried for them as I cried for my brothers and sisters and what we had to see and will have to live with.  It's not easy but it gets better every day.  Knowing that there are writers who have this much insight really made me feel like everything will be okay.

Sure it's not perfectly realistic... but like M.A.S.H., it's about the people and the relationships.  I actually have some good memories from Iraq and they are all about the bond I was lucky enough to share with other soldiers.  That's what I see when I watch this - not politics, not rhetoric, not social commentary.  Believe it or not, we never really cared about any of that while we were there.  We just took care of each other and lived each day the best we could.

That is what these characters did.  Good writing; first episode is a little rough, don't judge the series on that one; Love Sarge Scream.  He's the epitome of what I admire most in noncoms: strength with a heart.",1147824000,8,1945,4.531609195402299
2466655,5,B000CNE0RO,"I'd heard about the series and was immediately interested since my son is a soldier deployed in Iraq. However, I could never catch what network or times the series would be airing. So, I never saw it until I stumbled across FX's reruns of the series. They aired 3 episodes every Saturday night for several weeks.

I've got to tell you that I was glued to my seat for the whole 3 hours! I absolutely loved the show. I liked the characters and how they interacted with each other. I wanted to strangle Dim's wife and hug Bo's. I got so wrapped up in the characters. Sgt Scream was amazing.

I know that this is Hollywood's version of the war but even with the technical inaccuracies, the story line made the individual soldiers REAL to the viewer-- not automatons that carry out orders as one mass unit.

Sooooo disappointed to find out they'd cancelled the show!!!! I agree with the guy who said it would be great if HBO would pick it up. But the least they could have done was wrap up the show for us. DON'T LEAVE US HANGING...

2466656,2,B000CNE0RO,"I really did not like ""Over There.""  I rented this film with one purpose in mind: I wanted to have an accurate portrayal (or the semblance of a portrayal) of what life is like in the deserts of Baghdad.  I wanted to know what the troops were going through.  Instead, this television show is distinctively anti-war and and anti-American.  The soldiers are portrayed as punks, low-lives, idiots, prostitutes, lesbians, unintelligent dopes, victims, killers, torturers--and more.  This is not justice to the soldiers in Iraq.  Instead of seeing characters with integrity and patriotism with the likes of Jack Bauer from 24, we are provided with characters who are shallow, depraved, and who spout out insults for no apparent reason.  Any person who has spoken to someone in the military knows that the soldiers are intelligent, well-spoken, and thoughtful people.

Now what was great is this show was not politically correct.  This coming from a die hard conservative.  The show was liberal at times but they didn't try to brain wash you either way so I liked it.  It dipected how soldiers feel, hardships they face.  Hell you get to see cool miltary weapons in action.  For this price its definetly worth buying.  This was a great show that FX needs to bring back.",1147132800,6,575,4.377358490566038
2466658,4,B000CNE0RO,"First I'd like to say to all the people complaining the show is not truthful and doesn't resemble the real war in Iraq (also with all my respect to the men who served or serving over there now): don't forget it's a movie. If you show me just one where everything is like in reality and where you can't say ""Oh, this is not true"", I'll eat my shoes for dinner. Cinema is about exaggeration and dramatization so we have to live with it. Another matter is if what you see on screen is SO NOT TRUE, that it's impossible to stand it. And ""Over There"" is definately not one of that kind.

What I didn't like was that there were no single f-word throughout the series as well as no nudity. It's a bit anoying but quite explainable. The other thing - we saw this squad during 13 episodes and it seemed they were fighting alone. Crowd of extras would do there very well, I mean I had an impression this squad is not a part of some bigger partition, but a unit acting totally on their own. Besides they were executing all kinds of tasks from escorting convoys to seizing villages and releasing hostages. On the other hand it gave more space to show relations within this unit so closer to the end of the show I started liking this fact. And I liked ""Over There"" in general. The actors were doing their best and Erik Palladino was genuinely authentic as sergeant - the leader of the group. ""Over There"" is great at showing military service as just another job, which is just more dangerous than all the others. Seeing people who do this job is very interesting especially for those who never served in the army. It's interesting to watch them deal with situations people usually don't come across in everyday's life, and it's more interesting to see how their job affects their characters, their lives and relationship with their families.

So while during the first couple of episodes I was thinking the show didn't live up to my expectations, the more I watched the more I became entangled by it and more excited. I really think the creators of the series succeeded. The last episodes left me craving more which I doubt will ever happen. But if the studio decides to go on with the second season, I'm buying it on DVD for sure.

If you like war-movies, ""Over There"" is for you without a question and even if you don't you still might like it - there's much more to it than just shooting etc. Really deserves to be contunued - good TV shows usually pick up speed the more they run.",1146614400,5,2471,4.402625820568928
2466659,1,B000CNE0RO,"Now I know why this series only lasted one season-- very bad.  The producer has no idea of how to portray soldiers and what is going on over here in Iraq.  This is my second time over here in Iraq, and I can't believe that Hollywood still portrays soldiers in such a horrible manner.  What's up with calling everyone ""Soldier"" anyway... and also, what's up with calling every officer ""Sir"" and also the callousness that officers have towards the troops.  NOT REAL.  Also, in Iraq, you would never see females in the type of unit/ squad that is portrayed in this series either.  Also, where's the uparmored vehicles that we really do drive around in anyway.

This show is in very poor taste to what goes on here in Iraq and at home with our spouses.  I think the producer did much injustice to the portrayal of soldiers.  Once again, Hollywoods way of trying to make a buck at the cost of portraying soldiers very badly.",1146182400,28,919,4.4879518072289155

Everyone cast is handsome/beautiful, the homefront scenes are WAY too dramatic and predictable, and nudity is shown (not full) for no good reason except obviously for ratings. plus the production made everything just a little too clean to be believed.

I'd say in general, this series is just a little too ""T.V."".I wish HBO could do a series similar to Band of Brothers about Iraq.",1146009600,2,531,4.966292134831461
2466661,2,B000CNE0RO,"I would imagine that the primary reason people would want to watch Over There is so that it might improve their understanding of what exactly is happening in Iraq.  In other words they watch because they want to understand what it might be like to be a soldier in Iraq.  The problem is that it becomes immediately clear to anyone with military experience that the producers have no better idea about what happens ""over there"" than any of the rest of us.

The show has absolutely no bearing on reality; at one point in the first episode the Insurgents get up on line and attack nearly shoulder to shoulder in the open like something out of the Napoleonic Wars.  While no one can expect 100% realism, I don't think it is out of line to expect that Over There's Iraq would exist somewhere in the same dimension as ours.  I'm not quibbling about minor details, the producers get the Army wrong on so many levels that the Army as portrayed by Over There is virtually unrecognizable from the Army that actually exists.  What this leads to is a realization within the first few minutes of the series, that the producers have no idea how the military operates and therefore have no idea what Iraq is like.  This fundamentally destroys the purpose of the show because if the producers can offer no insight into what it is like to be a soldier in Iraq then there is no reason to watch the show.

The producers have come from a position of complete ignorance, imagined what life in Iraq might be life, and made a show based upon that imagining.  I believe it was Aristotle who said that poetry is truer than history.  What he meant was that history can get facts wrong but poetry can instruct us in the universal truths of the human condition.  While no one would argue that Over There should attempt to be history, the fact of the matter is that it completely fails to help us appreciate a facet of the human experience.  In failing do to that it fails as a television series.",1145232000,8,1966,4.460893854748603

We all pretty much know what to expect from a war as far as death and I've had enough shock and awe to last a lifetime.  As the wife of a soldier waiting at home alone everynight for 1 year, this gave me a chance to be with the soldiers out there and feel understood when it came to the families.  It isn't a ""perfect"" depiction of how things are out there but it was enough for me.  Why did I become so attached to this series and why did I take it so personal?  It was a good series.  I think they did a good job putting the characters together.  It gave me something to look forward to every week that I could relate to.  I was very disappointed when I heard it was cancelled.

2466663,3,B000CNE0RO,"I just read a review on this page from a guy that has been in  Iraq who commented solely on how inaccurate this show was I believe it was the review by Joe Iraq.  First of all this series is not bad and although you might think that you have some kind of advantage over me in the knowledge of military tactics, weaponry and general conditions of Iraq, you're wrong.  Secondly you have to remember that this is a series, in other words it has a limited budget, filming somewhere like Mexico makes it hard to effectively create gigantic sandstorms and things of that nature.  I do agree with you to the extent that the tactics overall were not amazingly done, overall there were too many incorrect firing positions, sloppy room take downs and poor tactical executions when entering and clearing a village.  I would also have liked to see more urban settings and the first episode ending firefight with the Americans walking in a straight line firing toward the Iraqi's was not very plausible.  However what you must remember is that this show is dedicated to showing the hardships of the American people, soldiers and the overall unknown objective of the war itself, and that it does well, it shows how hard it is to leave your loved ones, it shows how difficult it is to fight an enemy that wears no uniform and has no lines, it is an accurate portrayl of war in general and that is what it was supposed to be, not a documentary on Iraq...

2466664,5,B000CNE0RO,"Over There depicted the average american soldier dealing with the effects of a modern war where there are no enemy lines or enemies that are apart of the civilian population.  I myself have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom III, and I have found myself watching this show agreeing with alot of the topics it covered.  Granted there were alot of inaccuracies, which go with ANY war movie or TV series, it had covered the current war with not only accuracy but the humanity of soldiers that is often overlooked by the media, and the American Population.  THIS WAS IRAQ.  We must remember not all instances were covered with any group of soldiers, but it had been covered by all.  Over There gave us a squad of Infantry and Mechanics who were to be the represenatives of the american soldier.  These characters depicted the general soldier who is risking life and limb in a war so clearly undefined.  It is an unbiased look at the american soldier both in combat and on the homefront.  As a soldier, myself, having served with the 278th Regimental Combat Team under 1st Infantry and 42nd Infantry, I personaly identified with these soldier, having to deal with the same problems they went through as well as my battle buddies.  These are characters who portray the american soldier faced with all situation that ALL soldiers deal with.  And we can never forget those who soldier who did die in the war, and we must give thanks to them.  Over There does just that for them, by telling a fictional story, they tell the story of every man and woman currently serving with the Armed Forces.  It was an accurate show that broadcast at the wrong time.",1143590400,9,1642,4.643598615916955

You Army people have to realize a show of the ACTUAL experiences over there is BORING.  Army guys sitting around not doing anything for long period of time is not a good show content.

2466667,1,B000CNE0RO,"I picked this up the same day it went on the shelves in stores.  It went in the trash almost as fast as I got it.

Having been to Iraq, I was greatly disappointed with the glaring inaccuracies in the whole project.  I couldn't make it through the first disc without being upset about the ""Hollywood"" spin of the Iraq war.  My own mother, recommended this set to me, and in all honesty.  I am upset they (Hollywood) would put a project of the floor without any kind of supervision, especially about a subject as touchy as this.

It all started while watching, ""The Pilot"", I noticed that people were talking on a chinook helicopter during flight. First, those things are so noisy you cant even hear youself think let alone hold a conversation.  Next was the first battle scene.  Maybe you have to be in the military to realize that a SGT doesn't scream at people the way the squad leader in that role does, especially in a time like that.  There is still a measure of professionalism.  Plus the tactics were all wrong.  The ""tactics"" they used more closely resembled a gunfight at the O.K. Corral than Iraq.  Send everyone in a row of gunfire so everyone can get shot all at once.  It not the tactic we use these days.

The third big inaccuracy in the show is the communication to the loved ones.  I NEVER had a chance to make a video to send home to my mom letting her know I was alright, and why was that?  Because of the fact that they don't do it.  The fact is that while there are telephones and computers, if you are lucky enough to stay in one spot long enough, you can talk to your loved ones every day, not once in a week or month whatever time frame they were going by.

The king of all kings, and ultimately the reason why I threw this set out is the way they portrayed women in the military.  I have spent three years in an infantry unit, and there were NO females assigned to it.  So the thought of having women on the front lines, just doesn't happen.  So in the ""REAL"" Iraq, ""Mrs. B"", and ""Doublewide"" would not have ever been there.  The army does not and will not put women in a situation like that.  The only plausible excuse to when a woman would be in a situation like that is if a convoy were to get ambushed.  Nothing taking away from women at all, but it just doesn't happen that way.

Hollywood cannot accurately catch a sandstorm either.  The one I saw, was mild compared to what I have been through.  Literally, you cannot see your hand in front of your face.

FOR THE RECORD, ALL OF THESE MISTAKES WERE JUST IN THE FIRST SHOW!  AND THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE I MADE THROUGH COMPLETELY BEFORE I GOT UPSET WITH THE INACCURACY AND THREW THE SET IN THE TRASH.

I was heavily disappointed, and felt like the wrong story was being told.  Truth be told, I'm glad they cancelled the show, because it inaccurately describes the lives of soldiers in Iraq.",1143417600,47,2866,4.291044776119403
2466668,4,B000CNE0RO,"The short lived TV show ""Over There"" is the first TV show that actually takes place during the conflict overseas that it's dramatizing. Well written, directed and acted the show the show garnered too much controversy forcing Fox to abandon the show despite decent ratings. Produced by Steven Bochco (""L.A. Law"", ""Hill Street Blues"", ""Cop Rock"", ""NYPD Blue"" among many others) the show manages to be more gritty and realistic than anything attempted on television before. While Bochco and his production crew were clearly influenced by gritty war dramas like ""Black Hawk Down"" but the show manages to establish its own style with the pilot episode (which was previously available solo on DVD).

""Over There"" follows the misadventures of a group of GIs fighting the war in Iraq and at the same time also followed their families and the impact their absence had on them. It was a unique blend of the personal and the global that portrayed more than one aspect of the effects of war. Unfortunately the show faced political minefields that Fox couldn't dodge and the show was buried in the FX cable schedule. It's very unlikely this show will come back for a sophomore season. It's too bad because this terrific show put a unique human face on a war we've only become familiar with from rhetoric and sound bites on TV.

Grainy and all the better looking for it, the director of photography of the show went for a deliberately grainy look to emphasize and heighten the sense of reality of the show. There's a lot of the jittery hand held camera shots that were popular in Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" that has come into vogue lately with a lot of movies (including Ridley's brother Tony Scott in his last two films). ""Over There"" strikes the right balance between creating the environment of the show and making it entertaining without causing audiences to be overcome with motion sickness. I didn't see any analog defects and the digital ones are minimal at best. Unlike many shows ""Over There"" boasts a solid 5.1 Dolby Digital mix that makes nice use of the surround speakers. The mix places the audience right in the middle of the action.

""Weapons Debriefing"" will make you familiar with the different types of guns in the series and what's being used. At just under six minutes this featurette is right on target. ""Tour of Duty: Filming `Over There'"" documents the production of the last episode of the show. Given that its ratings were so poor unless a major network picks it up, the show is DOA and it's terrific that we have a feature length documentary on the series production. Usually when shows are cancelled there are a couple of featurettes in the can in anticipation of DVD release but nothing as elaborate or involved as here.

We also get three exceptional commentary tracks. The pilot episode features writer/director Chris Gerolmo and producer Joan Gerolmo discussing the challenges of shooting the pilot episode and bringing the sense of realism to the screen. ""Spoils of War"" features many of the cast members and ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding"" (quoting Bob Dylan no less in the title) features the military advisors. The latter is particularly interesting because you discover the amount of detail that went into creating a realistic production and some of the short cuts the production had to take to get the series to TV.

Although it's time on TV was brief, ""Over There"" provided a fascinating glimpse into modern day war. The most realistic looking TV show of its time and the only one to air during the conflict it's about, the show looks extremely good in this transfer with a nice clip of extras. The price along with the extras makes this an essential purchase for fans of the show.",1143158400,33,3716,4.790951638065523

2466671,5,B000CNE0RO,"From the very first disk in the series, I was hooked on this show.  My son was in Desert Storm as a medic.  There are many other great war movies and series out that are just as graphic such as the heart rending Band Of Brothers.

Timing is the factor here.  World War II was 60+ years ago. Many of the men such as my father are now gone.  The Viet Nam War is part of MY history.  It too, is now ""history"".  With the current war in Iraq still ongoing, I think this show may have upset many people stateside who still have soldiers ""over there"".  Televison IS still about entertainment.  I think many people have seen too much on CNN on a daily basis to be entertained by a movie about an ongoing conflict.

  It is my thought that once this conflict is finally resolved and all of our soldiers come home, maybe..........10 years or so later this series could come back and be a great success.  The entire series is totally believable.  A great job was done by the cast and entire crew.

  Another thing to watch is the slew of movies coming out this coming year on 9/11.  Even five years later, I feel that these movies are going to be coming a bit too soon for some people to handle.",1143158400,8,1184,4.1866666666666665

2466674,5,B000CNE0RO,"I'm not going to sit here and disect every aspect of this show.  The best way I can sum up how good it was, is, to say, from a former soldier, that this show, truly, took me to another place.  I often watch current shows on my TIVO and, kind of, wait for them to end.  With ""Over There"", I always wanted more.  I wanted more of the stories and more of the characters.  Each time I thought ""this show can't be this good.""  Yet, each week it outdid itself. In my experiences I've seen aspects of all of those stories.  Is it perfect?  Of course not, but it gave a compelling, mostly entertaining, depiction of what military life is like.  Sure, there is a tendency for TV shows to make officers appear to have ""other"" agendas or whatever, I guess we expect that, and, it isn't true.  Most officers are extemely sharp and caring.  However, they do have to remember the rules, and that is an important, perhaps overstated, part of the military story. All I keep thinking is I want more of ""Over There"".  By the way, I love the title song.  It is amazing more people didn't watch, and, don't watch the best shows on TV: ""Rescue Me"" and ""Nip Tuck"".  Talk about shows that should get 20 million viewers!!
By the way, for former military types who give this show a low rating, remember one, very important, thing:  99.99% of TV shows are made in order to make money(Either for the producers or the studio).  Telling a great story, or, conveying an important message, is just a nice bonus.  If you criticize this show because it doesn't portray a certain ""historical"" or ""political"" message, just remember that money is the most motivating factor for getting a show on primetime.

There was absolutely no political stance to any extreme.  It did a good job of telling the stereotypical stories of what our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines are dealing with.

I watched and loved every episode from start to finish and was saddened by the fact the FX cancelled it.

There is so much more that this series can do and so much more that the characters can go through.  I also think that if the censors lay off, it will generate the respect for our fighting men and women deserve, whether you agree with the way or not.  Because, it is above all else, a tribute to our troops.

The only upside to the cancelling would be that HBO could possibly pick it up and continue the series.  It would be able to depict more of the violence and real language that our troops use.

It was the total opposite which surprised me. The screenplay stayed away from any political agenda and painted a realistic picture of the `fog of war`.

I'm a grown man who hardly shows emotion. Every episode either had me in tears, laughing out loud, excited with adrenaline or any combination of the three.

From the sarcastic one liners from `Sgt. Scream` to the smooth under pressure `Angel`. Every character felt real. The kind of acting that makes you forget cameras are rolling.

The Marketing people @ FX should loose thier jobs and have thier heads examined along with the pinheads at corporate who decided to axe season 2.

Of all the bulletin boards and discussion groups on the internet, almost 99.9 % of the opinions are 2 thumbs up and 5 star ratings. Now that's quality reviews my friends.

May the sale of this DVD and the continued rave reviews on the web raise an eyebrow @ FX or another network that is willing to possibily continue this series.

Even though a drama series like this will at most receive an `Emmy`, the acting, screenplay and cinematography was hands down `OSCAR` material.

Erik Palladino steals the show as `SGT. Scream` with his cut-to-the-chase, politically incorrect but with military tact, leadership by example style.

The show is about that.  Does that make it anti-war?  NO!  Ridiculous!  Get real!  Are these people suggesting the soldier experience is like going to Disneyland?!  During WWII, we suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties, maybe even millions.  Tens of millions of lives were impacted.  People made sacrifices.  People suffered.  Does that mean WWII was not worth fighting?

I'm Republican and I whole-heartedly support the war in Iraq (although not the way it was carried out).  This show is not anti-war!  It's pro-soldier!

2)  IT'S NOT REALISTIC ENOUGH

I'm a layperson like most people I suspect when it comes to military matters.  I'm in no way affiliated with the military and have never even come close to a real combat situation.  And even I know and can recognize there are definitely holes in the show's portrayal of warfare and combat (IEDs marked with white flags?!).  But the essence of it all and the overall portrayal works well enough for me.  Think of the alternative -- Rambo!!",1138233600,9,1527,5.048582995951417

2466686,1,B000CNE0RO,"I wish I could give it minus stars. This is a copy of a letter I wrote to Bochco in July of 2005 after watching the premiere episode:

""Dear Mr. Bochco;

I just watched the premiere episode of your new series ""Over There"" on the FX network and wanted to share with you my thoughts on the program. This is the first time in my life I've been motivated to send a letter to the producer of a show - that's how strongly I feel about what I just saw.

First, some background. I'm 56 years old and I was raised in a foreign service family. I enlisted in the Army in 1969 and served in Vietnam from summer of 1969 to summer of 1970. I'm a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I make it a point to stay current on military affairs. My daughter is 19 years old, and over the last couple of years has had several of her friends enlist in the Army and Marines. Some have served in Iraq; a couple have died in the service, at least one of them during combat operations in Iraq. They're all very proud of their service, and justifiably so. I mention these things so that you know I'm speaking with a very intimate knowledge of military life.

That having been said, I thought what I saw tonight was simply ludicrous, and I'm going to tell you why.

Let's start with the political tenor of the show. The Vietnam War ended 30 years ago; you may have noticed. It was in all the papers. And yet what we got tonight was a rehash of the same old, trite anti-war tripe that was so popular in the 70's. Part of that was the caricatural characterizations of the troops that was also so popular back in the bad old days: the bellicose and disaffected sergeant who somehow gets away with yelling at his superiors when he's not yelling at or threatening his subordinates; the incompetent junior officer; the over-educated enlisted man (I mean come on - a Cornell man is a private?); the over-indulgent senior officer/father figure who insults the lieutenant in front of the troops; the nave high school football quarterback; etcetera, etcetera. A poor man's version of Stone's ""Platoon"".

Then there are the tactical issues. You've got a sergeant leading a six man fire team; that's the job of a corporal. A sergeant would be leading a full squad. As far as I could see, those six people were the only US troops opposing whatever force was in the mosque. A bit undermanned, wouldn't you say? And in their position behind the berm, they're in line about three yards apart. One mortar round or grenade could wipe out the whole group. For a sergeant who keeps yelling about how he's going to keep his troops alive, ""Screamer"" was certainly doing a very poor job of it. And that's another thing, why are all those soldiers having very loud conversations while they're supposedly holding a night position? I almost busted a gut laughing at that one.

I could go on, but I think you get the point. Basically, in trying to revisit the anti-war hyperbole of the Vietnam War era, you've grossly misrepresented the soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen who are serving our country so nobly in the Middle East. You are doing them a huge disservice, and frankly I think your characterizations are insulting to them. It would be even more insulting if the show wasn't so silly on so many levels.

On a personal note, I hope FX yanks this show off the air. In aid of that possibility, I'm forwarding to them, via email, a copy of this letter.""

Bochco did have the good grace to write back and ask me to try a few more episodes and give the show a chance, which I did, including trying to watch another episode on FX last night. I've seen nothing to change the opinions I stated in my first letter to him.

In my opinion, this show stinks, and does a grave disservice to our military. Don't buy the DVDs, don't watch the show, write FX a letter of complaint and demand they yank this turkey off the air.",1137888000,26,3872,4.417952314165498
2466687,5,B000CNE0RO,"I first heard of the show shortly after I returned home from Iraq, I don't have cable so my brother taped the season for me. I have to tell ya, this was very realistic for it being a t.v. show. I mean most movies or shows you see that try to recreate something like this, they don't do their homework. Someone at FX did...maybe too well. Yeah I have to disagree with some things; like how the soldiers spoke so formally with their suepiors, and the guys are a little more casual with the females in real life, but otherwise they did great. I happen to like the song, but it does get annoying that they play it so much. Also I found it to be suspenseful and compelling, the people at FX found some good writers, I mean look at ""E-ring"" Now with those charactors they are hard to believe because we know them from other movies and shows. It's nice to see some young fresh faces that act pretty well and are beleivable. Thumbs UP!",1136851200,49,927,4.242937853107344

8099507,3,B000CNE0RO,"The show begins to move well after the pilot but never builds a huge head of steam. TBH I only remember watching the series on DVD and have never seen this series ever replayed on TV. The season moves along and then ends abruptly, no finish. No tying up loose ends. Which is a shame because this series deserved at least that much.",1496620800,,331,4.26984126984127

8099509,5,B000CNE0RO,It's as good as I remember. I watched Overthere when it first aired on tv and fell in love with the characters. It first macks you realize what a solder goes through in combat. So I give it five stars just because I love this show. My wife evensaid she liked it and my wife doesn't watch war movies with me.,1486425600,,307,4.049180327868853

It's very interesting to watch their transformation from high school graduates to young men.  You see them meld together for the betterment of the group and struggle to resolve ethical issues together.",1480636800,,348,4.830508474576271
8099512,5,B000CNE0RO,Great modern story of an Army unit mostly new to combat in Iraq. Well written engaging story reflecting  realities of culture clash with citizens and within unit. Series produced originally by cable channel FX only lasted on year and was not renewed. Very engaging story lines with strong technical support throughout.  Highly recommended although some scenes may be too intense and gory for some.,1472774400,,397,5.1875
8099513,2,B000CNE0RO,"I wanted to like this but, unfortunately, I didn't make it through about 20 minutes of the Pilot episode. I'm sure that some military life is like this but it has a lot of language in it. I was expecting something along the lines of ""The Unit"" so I was disappointed with this purchase. The DVDs were as described and the video quality was good. This just isn't for me.",1472515200,,368,4.271428571428571
