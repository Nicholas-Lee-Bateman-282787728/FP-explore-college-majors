1669655,5,B00005V1WU,"First off, the dumb girl who said that this DVD was missing a lot, Jessica never made ""Whats It Gonna Be"" & ""There You Were"" a single.  She is so Jessica fan!
  Now, this is definately 5 stars.  It features all the videos up to the time it was released & has some of the making of the videos.  This is an excellent DVD & not too long or short.  I reccommend this to everyone!!!!!

1669658,5,B00005V1WU,"Jessica Simpson's first DVD release, DREAMCHASER, gives fans a treat with some rare interviews, studio clips, and music videos. The DVD runs at about 50 minutes. It goes from the beginning of her career when she was a gospel singer, to her first album SWEET KISSES, then her newest album IRRESISTIBLE. Lots of interview clips and behind the scenes. The videos for ""I Wanna Love You Forever"", ""Where You Are"" (duet with Nick Lachey), ""I Think I'm In Love With You"", ""Irresistible"" and ""A Little Bit"" are all on here. Plus they have behind the scenes for the videos of ""Irresistible"" and ""A Little Bit"". The DVD captures who Jessica really is, and what she has done to get where she is in her career. When she talks, its very honest and believable. As well there are clips of behind the scenes of her duet with Marc Anthony on ""There You Were"" and some tour footage too. Overall its a good buy for all this stuff and if you want to know more about her, or want some extras and all that, this is your DVD.",1015718400,7,1002,4.39247311827957
1669659,5,B00005V1WU,I think this video is a must have for all Jessica fans because she tells all. She says how she started singing in church and how she became a singing sensation.  I love it that she included all her music videos and alittle bit of behind the scenes stuff with the making of the videos.  I also really enjoyed that she included the process of recording the song with Marc Anthony. This video is an A+ and I have no regrets buying this video..believe me its worth getting..!!!Jessica Simpson is #1...,1012262400,,497,4.450549450549451
1669660,5,B00005V1WU,"THis is a great video for Jessica's fans.  She has all of her videos, the making of some of her videos, how she got where she is, and she talks to you personally about how she feels in this music indusrty.  She also includes a little of her dreamchaser tour.  I wished she would have added a little more of the tour.  I really enjoyed the video and the DVD and recommend it.

7955832,4,B00005V1WU,"Yup, I had to get this cause I love Jessica's song ""I Wanna Love You Forever"". I owned Jessica's Reality Tour Live DVD first and was very disappointed that this song was not in it, I'm sure it was performed but not added to the DVD which I think is kinda dumb cause that was Jessica's first hit. So I had to order this here and just that video alone is 4 stars to me. This DVD reminds me of Christina Aguilera's first DVD ""Genie Gets Her Wish"", which I also own.

7955838,5,B00005V1WU,This is a great video collection of her past videos. I love it. From the sweet 'I Wanna Love You Forever' to the record label controlled image of 'Irrisistible' and 'A Little Bit' I love the 'A Little Bit' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop. But overall this dvd is awesome. I like the footage from the Dream Chaser tour and the biography stuff. This is the best dvd before Jennifer Lopez's The Reel Me..,1080345600,,460,4.2988505747126435
