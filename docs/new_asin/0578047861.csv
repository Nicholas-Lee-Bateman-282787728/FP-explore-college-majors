La presentamos en todas las iglesias hispanas de Indianapolis, pero tenemos que ir traduciendola nosotros mismos.  Nos gustaria que saliera tambien en espanol.  Los hispanos son los de mas rapido crecimiento dentro de la Iglesia y nos gustaria mas material en espanol. Gracias por esta pelicula pues muestra quienes realmente somos.  Muchos no conocen nuestra iglesia y ya es hora de que pueda conocernos mejor.  Gracias.",1285286400,2,568,5.459770114942529
2636,4,0578047861,"As an Adventist, I enjoyed viewing this DVD.  It was fair and informative.  Seventh Day Adventists are portrayed as the thinking individuals that we are. While most of the information will be familiar to us, there were things that I learned from watching this film.

Time is given to our history and faith.  Attention is called to our health message and personal lifestyle.  However the lion's share of the film was devoted to our health institutions and professionals.  If I had one wish, it would have been to see more of the personal aspect of being an Adventist.

I recommend this DVD to Adventists and anyone who wants to know more about us and our vision.",1279065600,3,661,4.646551724137931
2637,5,0578047861,This is just an awesome documentary. I loved every minute of it. I am really interested in health and well being. I am sharing my DVD with so many people that I need another one for myself. I want to watch it again. It is great.,1275523200,3,228,3.9782608695652173
2638,5,0578047861,"The Adventists film does a fantastic job of showing the cutting edge health care system and health message of one of the longest living people groups on earth. I was challenged and inspired, both to live more healthfully, and to be a more excellent nurse. I highly recommend this film to anyone even remotely interested in religion or in health. It beautifully portrays God's desire for each one of us to prosper and to be in good health.",1275523200,7,438,4.628205128205129
2639,5,0578047861,Martin Doblmeier did a great job with this documentary. He covers a brief history of the Adventist Church and ties this to a healthy lifestyle as taught and practiced by the church members. He highlights the present cutting edge medical work and facilities that are working to help people reach a healthy life.  There is more to the Adventist church than a healthy lifestyle but this film does a nice job covering that area. I was given a copy of this dvd to review but had already seen it and was planning on getting my own copy anyway.,1275264000,2,537,4.479591836734694
2640,5,0578047861,"This documentary is a great overview of the Adventist Church's health mission, history, and facilities. Doblmeier is a wonderful filmmaker who has really captured the essence of Adventism in an unbiased manner.

This is a must-see for anyone who is either looking to further understand Seventh-day Adventists, or for Adventists who want to see how others (non Adventists) view the Church.

Kudos!",1274400000,8,396,5.370967741935484
2641,5,0578047861,"I AM AN ADVENTIST, SO PERHAPS I AM SLIGHTLY BIASED, BUT I FOUND THIS DVD TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE  OF THE ADVENTIST PEOPLE.  IT DID NOT TELL MUCH ABOUT THE DOCTRINES THEMSELVES, BUT THAT IS OK, BECAUSE THIS DVD WAS MEANT TO BE ABOUT HEALTH AND WHY THE ADVENTISTS LIVE APPROXIMATELY 10 YEARS LONGER THAN MOST OTHER PEOPLE.  AT A LENGTH OF ABOUT ONE HOUR AND 15 MINUTES, IT IS FILLED FULL OF HELPFUL INFORMATION AND DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO BE BORING.  THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE TITLE; IT LEADS ONE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FILM IS STRICTLY ABOUT THE ADVENTIST RELIGION, NOT THEIR HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED ""HEALTHY HABITS OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS"".",1274313600,3,715,4.5984251968503935
2642,5,0578047861,"Martin Doblmeier was the person to film and make this documentary about an obscure religion. I enjoyed the film. I did not give a full five stars because it only focused on diet and exercise. Mr. Doblmeier did very well with this, aspect. I would like to have seen more of the reasons behind for food and exercise and the spiritual part of this religion.

I recommend this film for anybody wanting to know more of Seventh-day Adventists;  but also pick up some of the recommended books and web sites for more information. I also have purchased more Adventist information, they have a wonderful health wise message.",1271289600,21,614,4.728971962616822
2643,4,0578047861,"Though I have a few friends of the Adventist faith I was unaware of the specifics of this religion.  This film uncovers the origin and modern practices of the Adventists.  I was interested most in the emphasis this religion puts on both the spiritual and physical bodies in regards to total wellness.  I would recommend this film to friends and family of all faiths looking to learn more about this religion and its impact on living longer, healthier lives.",1270512000,32,457,4.7594936708860756

2645,5,0578047861,"Martin Doblemeir did a great job again.  This one tells about how the medical
work has spread around the world.  He only touched the tip of this ohe but couldnt
possibly get a grip on it it is so mamouth.  When you travel anywhere in the world,
look for the nearest health care place and most of the time, you will find one of the
Adventist ones.",1393977600,,346,4.134328358208955
2646,5,0578047861,"I really wish I was one of the actors to proclaim the gospel of Christ Though I don't really know how many  Theater  courses that I would have to finished or whether I was supposed to be a film major for one them or not. But I enjoyed Adventism so much and its steadfast message that I always desire what they offer, despite individual folks in the church who might take God the wrong way who says salvation is personal.
  I hope to help the movement reach Holy Hollywood, in Jesus name Amen! I did pray a lot for Adventist film you know thank God For ""Good Good"" and goodies in The Adventist sectors. Oh! Ouch the Adventist Hospitals are so good so does the vegan and vegeterian well prepared food.
Jesus loves for giving us good and steady Adventist film in this day and age. Thank God for Chef Boyardventist

2652,5,0578047861,"The Adventists 2 was an amazing insight into the motivation behind Adventist Health Care Missions.  As a veterinarian and a life-long Adventist, I have had clients who sought me out because of their experience with Adventist physicians.  This documentary offered an in-depth view of the state of Adventist Healthcare and especially the philosophy and vision which the Adventist Church brings to it.  I found myself watching with pride as physicians were interviewed who were truly motivated not by economic gain, but by the opportunity to serve - to serve their God and to serve their fellow men and women.  Some of those physicians were people with whom I had gone to college.  This film makes me proud that my son is currently in medical school at Loma Linda University, where he is exposed to this amazing service-oriented philosophy and mission-minded provision of health care.  Thanks for this insight into the world of Adventist healthcare.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to gain the same insights or those who doubt that a church organization can achieve unselfish service.",1377648000,,1102,5.088888888888889

2656,5,0578047861,"If I had to describe this film with one word, it would be 'inspirational!'  It demonstrates effectively how the Adventists are putting God's word in action by 'doing for the least of these.'  The film made me stop and take stock of my own life!",1372291200,,244,4.4
2657,5,0578047861,These people are truly selfless. They think of others more highly than themselves. If I was younger I would love to go on a mission trip with them.,1370736000,,147,4.285714285714286
2658,5,0578047861,"I may be considered a little biased as my family spent 3 1/2 years as medical missionaries in Brazil working with the Seventh-day Adventists. Before becoming an Adventist myself about 15 years ago, I had never even heard of Seventh-day Adventists. Even today, many other denominations are still confused about who Adventists are, even though the Kelloggs cereal company was started by Adventists as part of their medical/health evangelism. Don't take others people's word for it, check them out for yourselves, Adventists are in more parts of the world, have more schools, more hospitals, than any other Protestant denomination. Are some of their doctrines unique? Yes, but most assuredly they are Biblical. I personally had read the Bible through many times and wondered where the churches were that preached the Bible as written before I became an Adventist. Adventists are not ""New Testament"" Christians they are ""Bible"" Christians. The video does a great job of bringing out the medical-missionary work.",1369008000,2,1007,5.3

2660,5,0578047861,"Doblmeier has done it again. After watching this excellent film on the medical and altruistic ministry of the Seventh-day Adventists, I felt very uplifted to know that there are people that put their effort into tangible and practical ways for the common good. Martin Doblmeier has done the Christian community a service telling us about different Christian stories of 'faith being alive' (see his commentary in the special feature of the ""director's Comments"" on the DVD) in people's lives. His work on Dietrich Bonheoffer and the Power of Forgiveness of the small community of the Amish people were second to none. And with this second serving of the Seventh-day Adventist Medical and Philanthropic Mission to the far corners of the world, he continues to tell a story of the faith that is active and that makes a difference. I highly recommend this film and anticipate many great documentaries from Doblmeier's creative filmaking and intentional and energetic filmosophy.",1368662400,,974,5.210191082802548
2661,5,0578047861,"Adventists 2 is a great documentary. It tells the stories of people helping other people in all parts of the world. The cinematography is professionally done with beautiful views of exotic locations. The stories flow nicely along and kept me interested during the entire film. Overall, I place this movie at the top of my list of favorite documentaries. It is on par with any other docs I've seen.",1367712000,,397,4.768115942028985

2663,5,0578047861,"The Adventists 2 moved me.  It portrayed the Adventists' ability and determination to make a difference in the far corners of the world.  These people would have dedicated their lives with no desire for recognition nor do they care whether or not anyone even knows what they were giving....and in most cases, these people have dedicated their entire lives to helping people medically.  Thank Goodness there are people like this director, Doblmeier, who are willing to follow them LITERALLY to the ""far and dangerous corners of the world"" to tell us their heart-warming stories.  Totally enjoyable learning experience for anyone and everyone!  I TOTALLY recommend.",1366761600,8,663,5.276190476190476
2664,5,0578047861,"I watched both ADVENTISTS and ADVENTISTS 2, and highly recommend both movies. They have made me think how health is the most important thing for each person - young or old, rich or poor. Unfortunately, so many people around the world don't have the access to quality healthcare. The ADVENTISTS 2 tells stories of doctors and nurses who travel to most remote places in the world and try to improve health of the local population.

Excellent movie!",1366761600,,446,4.792207792207792
2665,5,0578047861,"Adventists 2 was shown at SON Screen. I liked it even better than the first film. Afterwards the young camera man, a graduate from Southern Adventist University who Doblmeier hired, talked about his experiences making the film. There are several surgery scenes and he described trying to get good shots while still staying out of the way of the doctors. The film also tells the story of a group from Kettering that regularly does short term mission trips. As usual, Doblmeier has done an excellent job.",1366243200,4,502,4.848837209302325
2666,5,0578047861,I really enjoyed seeing some of the world's healthiest people who also live longer.  I just wish the documentary was longer....and contained more information about how they live their everyday lives.  I don't know how difficult this life style would be to copy in my life.  I would like to know more.  Longevity really is a big interest and avoiding illness really interests me.,1354492800,,378,4.859375
2667,5,0578047861,As a Seventh-day Adventist I highly recommend this DVD. It's informative even for us. It's also a great way to introduce others to our health message and benefits of following God's way.,1348099200,,186,4.84375
2668,5,0578047861,"A wonderful documentary, just wish it had been longer or done in several parts.  Loma Linda Hospital has long been known for their cutting edge treatment plans and their 'eat healthy, live healthy' diet lifestyles.",1332028800,,214,5.114285714285714
2669,5,0578047861,"This is an excellent production.  A good blend of Adventist beginnings and their current distinctive features.  It is an important contribution to health and health care.  I applaud the Adventists for not turning over health care to gov't only, but continuing to make it a mission of the church, in the tradition of Jesus and the church through the centuries.  Great.",1323043200,,367,4.967213114754099
2670,4,0578047861,I really enjoyed the film but I'm hoping the next one will include more of the Seventh-day Adventist church as the health message is well covered in the first film!  Looking forward to seeing the next one on Adventists (International) he is planning.,1308182400,,250,4.813953488372093
2671,5,0578047861,"This is an excellent presentation of the Adventist message of well being and wellness. It is also, true there are many other facets of the Adventist faith, practices and doctrine that are not included. The author is focused on one specific core value, and briefly includes an overview of Adventist history and beliefs.

There are some who would say that Adventists are, believe or act in ways that are intepreted as or understood as negative or unflattering. In truth, Adventists are little more than a microcosm of our world, there are and will be ""flakes to fanatics"" and ""saved to surrendered"" within the membership.

There a millions of Adventists who represent their faith with excellence and outstanding investments of time, talent and treasure. Adventist humanitarians, educators, attorneys, medical personnel, military and government leaders; as well as every other walk of life, in almost every country of the world, are contributing members of society impacting the world in positive ways in the name of Jesus.

Adventists are not perfect, any more than any other faith tradition, or than those who choose no faith... just people being transformed daily to imitate the Savior in deeds, thoughts and beliefs.",1305763200,3,1217,5.198979591836735

2673,1,0578047861,"Don't be swayed people. I was an SDA for 35 years. The doctrine of the church goes against the Gospel of Jesus Christ in so many ways, it's not even funny. Rather than buy this movie, might I suggest that you buy one or all of these books to find out the history & doctrines of the SDA church.
