8326429,5,B001F7Q4K2,This is a great video however what they don't tell you is that it is the same video as the lower body workout that she has as well. in little letters on the back and I mean little it tells you this. so if you want a great lower body workout this is for you but if you have the other one don't get this one.,1395187200,3,306,3.6515151515151514
8326430,2,B001F7Q4K2,"I had purchased several of Keli Roberts' DVD's and thought they were excellent.  When I was notified that a new DVD from Ms. Roberts was about to be released, I was delighted and ordered it.  Much to my chagrin, this DVD is simply a re-cut version of ""Keli Roberts Lower Body and Core.""  There is nothing new here - except that the editors have put more chapter selections on the menu and created pauses between each exercise set (which is actually rather annoying).  Nowhere on the advertising for this DVD, supposedly released in December of 2008, is the buyer notified that this is simply a re-titled version of an earlier DVD.  It leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.",1231545600,38,672,4.566666666666666
