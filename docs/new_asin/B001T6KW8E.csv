8340654,4,B001T6KW8E,"I'm having a heck of a time trying to play each film.  When I select, say, Blondie Goes on Vacation, it has five choices, all of which are excerpts  of the movie.  How do you select the movie where it starts from the beginning?  It's so frustrating.",1382918400,,249,4.23404255319149

8340656,4,B001T6KW8E,"These are the Blondie and Dagwood movies that were repackaged in the early 1960's for television with a different introduction/title sequence but they are the original movies in full.  The film print transfer to DVD is a good and decent quality and there are quite a few movies on each of the three DVDs.  I wish someone would release the Blondie and Dagwood movies on DVD in a fully restored condition with the original theatrical release title sequences.  Other than that, I would recommend this collection",1357344000,6,508,4.883720930232558
