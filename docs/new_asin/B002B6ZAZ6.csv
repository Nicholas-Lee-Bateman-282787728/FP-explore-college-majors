8360769,5,B002B6ZAZ6,"5-Disc DVD set of Charlie's Angels: Season 1 in a Soft Shell was released in Japan (Region 2) on August 25, 2009, 6 years after their first Region 1 release and 2 months after Farrah Fawcett passed away.

Relive the first year of the 3 girls now working for Charlie in the complete first season of Charlie's Angels on NTSC Region 2. The English version is still here while the Japanese dub is included for the Japanese audience residing in the US. However, the Japanese packaging is totally different! It looks a lot smaller in person and the discs are in CD plastic shells you find at the public library. At least the DVDs are safer in separate plastic CD cases, and the packaging artwork on the outside feels pretty cute.
