3823112,4,B001VNT1CS,"I like the DVD. the exercises were what I was looking for. The only problem I have is they are all upper body and the DVD was too short. I do appreciate what there is, though. She explains each exercise and what it does. She doesn't go too fast as another DVD I have does. By too fast I mean in changing from one to another not the speed that she does the exercise.",1348012800,3,365,3.945945945945946
3823113,5,B001VNT1CS,This has been beneficial for our Pulmonary Rehab.  It has great instruction on breathing techniques as well as exercises to strengthen the muscles used for breathing.,1343692800,3,166,5.384615384615385
3823114,5,B001VNT1CS,after being diagnosed with copd I was devastated. this excellent DVD marked the end of fear and the start of fighting back. the workout on the DVD can be done on several levels so even the most challenged patient will find it useful. proper diet and a good exercise routine are vital to slowing the progression of COPD and are the keys to enhancement of your life. My blood pressure has gone from 150/90 to 116/75 and my resting heart rate has declined 10 points. If you have COPD please get moving and use this DVD.update..my FEV1 has increased by 13%.,1323734400,31,553,4.485148514851486
3823115,5,B001VNT1CS,"This DVD is great for us with COPD.  There are both great breathing exercises, stretching and a little weight.  I particularly like the way she stops periodically telling the participate to take breathes; something very important for us.

I would recommend to anyone with COPD!!

I wish she'd come out with more advanced exercises for COPD users.

Thanks",1297209600,3,354,5.0344827586206895

3823117,5,B001VNT1CS,"I purchased this product for a friend and he said it is very helpful
to him with learning correct way to breathe.",1243296000,6,113,4.181818181818182
3823118,5,B001VNT1CS,"This was a rather slow paced exercise video, with a good instructor who explained each exercise rather it was a physical exercise or a breathing exercise. It can be boring if you let it because it is slow paced but if you give it a chance I think you will find that doing the exercises either sitting or standing will help you greatly if you have COPD, or Asthma ( I have both).  I am 62, and have had COPD since I was 32.  I spent 15 years in the Army when I was medically retired because of the COPD. Over the years I was finally placed on oxygen, and had given up exercise. But recently upon a vist to my doctors office I learned how much weight I had gained, and decided I needed to do something, anything if it could help me breath better. I don't really expect to lose much weight using this video, but it has motovated me to stop using my COPD as an excuse to sit on the couch and to start moving more, even if it means I sit down every 5 minutes to catch my breath. I know COPD is a killer and will kill me in the end, but I am not going down without a fight. For the cost of this video its well worth the instruction on breathing exercises alone, so if you know someone with copd, or have any breathing problem, this video is likely to open your eyes. I recommed this video to anyone who has this terrible disease.",1440028800,9,1323,4.0458015267175576
3823119,3,B001VNT1CS,A little slow.  Perhaps best for folks with advanced COPD.  Best for a reminder about the importance of deep breathing. The DVD skips/freezes a little.,1434758400,,151,5.0

3823137,3,B001VNT1CS,"I was disappointed in this video.  I have COPD and was looking for some exercises I could do to help.  The instructor had some good info, but at first glance at the lit candles in the backgroud, I knew there was no one using oxygen.  The woman ""guest"" did not have any breathing problems as she smiles the entire time and does the exercises way ""too"" fast.  The biggest problem with following the exercises was not telling when to breathe in and out.  I would not recommend this video to COPD patients.",1350691200,13,502,4.413043478260869
