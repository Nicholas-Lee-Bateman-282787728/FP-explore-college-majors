172206,5,093804527X,"These ""evil"" kettlebells have been around for over a century. They faded from the weight lifting landscape with the advent of modern bodybuilding. With this video, Pavel Tsatsouline is bringing kettlebells back in vogue. The exercises are similar to powerlifting movements, but with a twist. Pavel teaches the use of dynamic muscular tension, which allows lifting in greater comfort, minimizing risk of injury. Forget about your cable crossovers, preacher curls and spinning classes. If you want a total body workout that's going to leave you lean, tight and strong, the Russian Kettlebell Challenge will do it! The most versatile weight training program on the planet, along with ""Power to the People"". The best thing about kettlebells is they can be taken anywhere. Tired of the gym? Take them to the park, or the beach, or your hotel room. This type of training cannot be beaten. If kettlebells were around when I started training, I may never have joined a gym.",1024963200,14,965,5.0375
172207,5,093804527X,"The Russian Kettlebell Challenge video is the companion to Pavel's book of the same name (also a must read).  It is well done, as are all of Pavel's products.  The video is an essential guide to the correct performance of the kettlebell lifts, which in my 30 years of working out are the most challenging, effective, and fun drills I've ever experienced.  Pavel's wry humor shines through here again, and he offers straight, no nonsense advice on getting into the best shape of your life.
Most kettlebell lifts can be done with dumbbells, but the authentic Russian kettlebells offer a whole new dimension of effectiveness.  Plus, the fun factor simply can't be overstated.
Lots of fitness products are swathed in hype.  This is one of the few (Pavel's other products are also happy, highly recommended exceptions) that actually deliver.  I have recommended this video to friends, and I highly recommend it to everyone as THE most productive fitness method - one that provides strength, flexibility, and endurance in one compact, highly addictive package.
Get this video, watch it closely, and get started.  You won't be sorry.",1024099200,6,1126,5.021505376344086
172208,5,093804527X,"This video is the real deal!  Following the program guidelines you will see a huge improvement in your endurance and strength levels and, as an added bonus, have a body to die for.  There is absolutely no better way to get fit, strong, etc.  Still skeptical?  Don't be.  Pavel knows what he is talking about and the straight-forward approach he employs in this video is a refreshing break from complex, hard-to-understand trainers who go through sentence after sentence without ever saying anything.  Don't keep wasting your money on gym membership, useless equipment, or expensive supplements; just get Pavelized!",1024099200,3,614,5.214285714285714
172209,5,093804527X,"Russian Kettlebells (they look like little cannonballs with suitcase handles) are an authentic Russian ethnic sport, and a weight-training device little seen in America since the 19th century. A fabulous training system for anyone interested in a combination of power, endurance, balance and coordination. Pavel, a former Russian Spetznaz trainer, presents a simple video that lays down the basic principles. Yes, you can do the exercises with a dumbell--and you should, at first, just to get a feel for the power of this system, which uses ballistic swings (snatches, clean & Jerk) and some standing techniques that resemble yoga with serious weights. Fascinating, and valid. Very highly reccomended!",1004832000,11,701,5.5
7793471,4,093804527X,"This DVD covers all the bases.  His form varies slightly from what I've seen on YouTube from other Russian Kettlebell Certified pros but it all works.  For beginners, don't be embarrassed to start with a 5lb or 10lb 'bell.  Correct form and safety are the most important things. Unlike me, a stubborn old man, take your time to build up to 35lb and greater 'bells and you'll be very happy you did.",1375488000,,397,4.486111111111111
7793472,4,093804527X,"The production quality of this video was less than ideal.  The video was not as expertly lit as many instructional videos for physical training.  The depth of knowledge of the instructor, however, is profound.",1364601600,,209,5.117647058823529
7793473,5,093804527X,"Although somewhat expensive, the video showed what I was doing wrong on the snatch and other techniques although I had read the book, ""The Russian Kettlebell Challenge."" Thus I improved my technique and reduced the pain suffered during Kettlebell workouts.  Bravo, Pavel!",1360972800,,271,5.4523809523809526
7793474,3,093804527X,If you've never done kettlebells this may be a decent exposure and instruction. A bit cheesy and some of the hip popping is a bit exaggerated... If you have done kettlebells and are looking for a workout with some instruction I highly recommend Extreme Kettlebell Cardio columes 1 and 2,1345248000,,286,4.74
7793475,2,093804527X,"While I appreciate Pavel's instruction and expertise, this video is a waste of money.  You are better off researching the exercises on youtube for free.  I have been using kettlebells for the last five years and this is my first Pavel video.  I was expecting a lot more for my money.  I own three Art of Strength videos and they are much better than watching Pavel just demoing the exercises.",1337299200,,392,4.557142857142857
7793476,5,093804527X,"If you are ready to truly experience Kettlebell lifting this DVD is for you.  This DVD walks you through all of the traditional kettlebell lifts, as well as gives you some tips for overall training.

All of the previous reviewers have really hit the nail on the head.  This film provides a great balance between verbal and visual instruction.  Not only does Pavel go over the foundational basics he also effectively teaches the more complicated lifts.  If it weren't for this video I would not have an understanding of the more complex moves.

I would highly recommend getting the DVD version rather than the VHS version of this training film.  The DVD version allows you to skip between sections easily and focus on certain exercises as you need them without slowing down your workout.  If you've already decided that you are ready for Kettlebell lifting this book belongs in your video library.",1124582400,4,896,4.848684210526316
7793477,4,093804527X,"The advantage of kettlebells: The weight hangs off the handle, so 1/some movements  are mechanically superior at heavier weights , when dumbbells would be too long, and 2/ leverage  on some exercises give a trainee more work per pound. BUT, a -great- deal of what is promoted as  an advantage is really only an advantage IF  you're interested in excelling at KBs in particular.  Pavel says, ""strength is a skill"". DB and KB strength aren't 100% transferable to each other , and KB strength is no more transferable than DB  to -any-  activity. The recent popularity of  KBs  proves the  importance of variety to maintain interest, but that's all.  Then there's the HIGH cost of KBs, (as Pavel has somewhat of a monopoly at the moment), and the promotional material of KB advantages, much exagerated, some false. Decades of athletes in all fields have excelled without KBs.  I'd  rather have the variety of weights that adjustable DBs provide at  a lower cost. .",1091750400,14,960,4.809815950920245
7793478,5,093804527X,"I recently purchased kettlebells, and when they arrived I immediately picked them up and started swinging them around haphazardly. Before I ordered them, I imagined that I would be able to teach myself the lifts. And I did. I taught myself some basic lifts, but quickly became bored. After all, how in the world could I ever use these things to work my pecs? My abs? Good leg exercises? etc. For a moment, I thought I had wasted my money on kettlebells. I thought that there were only a few exercises that I could do with them. But then I figured that there must be a reason tons of people are using kb's these days. So I figured I'd break down and buy Pavel's video.

  I was immediately impressed with the production quality of the video. Some fitness videos come across pretty cheap and it's hard to see the exercises sometimes. Fortunately, not here. The video begins with Pavel talking briefly, but wastes no time in getting down to business--the lifts. Pavel begins by showing all the basic lifts- the swing, clean, snatch, jerk, and shrugs. I already knew how to do these lifts, but Pavel showed nice tips and pointers like keeping your wrist in alignment and absorbing shock so that your arm doesn't get bruised up.
  Then the video got into the stuff I really bought it for--great lifts. The one in particular that I was looking for was the floor bench press. It is a pretty complicated lift, something that I would not have been able to do without seeing the video. Then there's tons of other great exercises he shows--my personal fave was the turkish get-up. This excercise has increaded my core strength so much that I think the price of the video is worth its price just for this exercise. There's no way I would have otherwise been able to learn how to do it.

  The only thing negative that I can say about the video is that at 40 bucks, it is a bit pricey. After all, there's alot of instructional videos in the exercise market that are half that price. However, many of those aren't worth 20 bucks. Even though Pavel's video is pricey, I would definatly consider it a worthwhile investment. There is no other way, for me, to have learned all these lifts. It is a much better value than a kettlebell book, in my opinion, because you can see the kettlebells in motion.
In short, the video quality was great, the information-the wide selection of lifts and the precise lifting methods- were great, the only possible flaw is the price, but the information imparted in the video is priceless. If you don't break down and spend fourty dollars on this video, you just wasted several hundred on kettlebells that you can't do much with.",1086912000,12,2644,4.563291139240507
7793479,5,093804527X,"Tough, fast, see the exercises performed for proper technique. A kettlebell really is an entire gym in one lump of iron. Pavel explains and demonstrates all the exercises in the book by the same name.

Of course be careful and you might get injured even if you do everything right but that's true about any exercise. Fear does not keep you from dying, only living.",1058400000,4,364,4.6
7793480,5,093804527X,"I've added 10 pounds and counting of pure muscle in 1 month. I didn't change my diet.
I only do a few exercises on a daily basis. Alternating strength days and cardio days. Snatches and Swings one day. Military Presses along with pullups the next.
I also follow Bullet Proof Abs another of his books w/video. I do Janda/Pavelizer situps every other day.
I am planning on buying the book to help out, but this video is good to start with. I could use the book to help nail down the technique on the bent presses.
Oh and the Dragondoor.com forum is a wealth of information not to be passed up. Even if you lurk like me.",1053302400,8,617,4.282051282051282
