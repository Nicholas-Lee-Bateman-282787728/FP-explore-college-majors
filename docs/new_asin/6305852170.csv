1084460,1,6305852170,"This is the worst video on a band ever. This video doesn't have anything useful in it, other than lots of the same pictures of the band that all  korn kids have seen before. I didn't even finish the video... it sucks that  bad ( i had to put in ""Who Then Now?"" to re-new my faith in KoRn,  ""R U Ready"" put me in a haze of bad video)Don't make a mistake  and by this tape!",966038400,2,371,3.779220779220779
1084461,1,6305852170,"I bought not the vhs, but the dvd of this worthless peice of film. I thought unauthorized was just the title of the movie. It really is unauthorized. Korn wasn't even consented about this movie. Don't make the  same mistake I made, don't buy this movie.",964396800,,253,4.5
1084462,1,6305852170,this video duzn't deserve anything just a bunch of people acting like koRns friends.  My advice if you want a good video of koRn buy who and then it is ten times better than  this suckey video!,963792000,,193,4.1891891891891895
1084463,1,6305852170,Not a good movie..If you were to sit around with some friends and talk about Korn while looking at pictures of the band you would end up with the same content in this movie...I especially liked the guy who knows the guy  who gave one of the band a tattoo...,951696000,3,257,4.14
7896731,1,6305852170,"I am a HUGE KoRn fan, so you can only imagine how POed I was when I saw this. The video doesn't even have the band, except for one part, which is 1/2 a mile away from the band. Plus, the host tries to be tough and cool by cursing, but he ends looking like a total jack-ass. I would only recommend this to the most die-hard KoRn fan who wants everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, anyone else hould just leave this DVD on the shelves and boycott it!",1109980800,2,445,4.01123595505618
7896732,1,6305852170,"I love KoRn and thats why i bought this DVD, but honestly guys, all this DVD is, is some punk trying to swear as much as he can cuz he's trying to be cool, as soon as the DVD starts the guy is standing there (...) screaming ARE YOU READY? I SAID ARE YOU (...) READY? and as the dvd progresses just proves my point that he is an an idiot even further, if you want a KoRn DVD get Deuce, it's funny, detailed and Very imformative, it would have at least six hours worth of stuff to see, i highly recommend that dvd, it is well worth the money and is One Hundred percent Official and Authorized by KoRn themselves, i am serious when i say this dvd doen't even contain a song by KoRn let alone an Interview or even a damn appearance by korn at all, all thats there are pictures of them that are repeatedly shown throughout the dvd. with that said people do have different poinions on this dvd so there is a chance that you may like it and if you don't (like most of us)you can just put it on your shelf with your other KoRn stuff just to make it look as if if you have a bigger KoRn collection (that's what i did lol!)",1090022400,,1113,3.995515695067265
7896733,1,6305852170,"Three words, KoRn fans:  DON'T BUY IT.  This is the worst video I have ever seen; I turned it off halfway through because I couldn't watch it.  It's a total waste of time and money, and I hope that any respectable KoRn fan will have the good sense to stay away from it. The host is a complete ass; all he does is swear, and quite unnecessarily at that.  There is no footage of the band, no interviews, nothing backstage; it's all footage of fans waiting outside concerts and little mini-interviews of people from Bakersfield who didn't really even know the band.  This DVD is a complete piece of garbage, so stay away from it.",1074988800,,626,4.408695652173913
7896734,1,6305852170,"this unauthorized dvd has NO band footage, NO interviews with the band and NOT ONE video.  it was all interviews with fans and clips of people outside shows.  i found it to be choppy, repititive and pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle.  it is as if someone had clips of korn and put it together themselves.  i thought the DEUCE DVD was much better.  there were some interesting parts, like the origins of the band and its name but again, it does not come from the band themselves.  if your going to do a DVD about a band, the band should be IN IT especially since KORN and their fans are pretty intense.  korn fans are known to be rabid and  about the band and yet on this, there is not one clip with the band?  seems odd.  i reccommemd you either rent, beg, borrow or steal it before you buy but otherwise stay away.  i bought this and returned it the next day.",1064793600,,863,4.201219512195122
7896735,1,6305852170,"I tell you,this video is a disgrace to the koRn name. Allthough it's an unauthorized video, I thought at least that there would be some good footage of koRn. But I was wrong. All it is is some guy talking bulls#*t who by the way has probably an iq-rate lower than his own shoe-size. What a jerk. He's just running around with his stupid camera and filming friends of his. Don't do the same mistake as I did by buying this crap-video. Buy yourself a hamburger or something instead.",1002931200,7,480,4.404494382022472
7896736,3,6305852170,"Not the best thing to come out with KoRn's name on it, but not the worst, the narriator seems totally stupid. can't stand the guy. but good info on their base of growing upa dn music roots, Bakersfield.",1000684800,,202,4.342105263157895
7896737,1,6305852170,"KoRn is a great band, but this DVD is NOT great!!  The very first screen should be a warning, it says ""This video contains no music or performances by KoRn"".  The ""host"" tries to act cool by being tough and cussing a lot; he just looks like a jackass!! I am very sorry I bought this DVD, it is a total waste of money. Hopefully KoRn will release a new video for the fans; until then, I hope you would keep your money (I wish I did).",996624000,24,432,3.954022988505747
7896738,1,6305852170,"I've never seen the DVD, but I felt oblidged to write a review after reading the other reviews. This video just sounds like it blows. Don't buy it.",996019200,,147,4.285714285714286
