5682052,5,B00BY8DKCM,"For aficianados of documentaries on obscure topics, this is the perfect movie.  Follows three different story lines about food lovers who are devoted to unusual fruits, most of whom are trying to preserve various strains of exotic or almost unknown ones.  This film visits lots of fascinating locations, including the Borneo jungle and a fruit-fiend convention.  Professionally made, including spectacular photography, you'll learn more than you can imagine and you'll enjoy this film more than you expect!",1378857600,,506,5.545454545454546
5682053,5,B00BY8DKCM,"I have heard of many types of obsessions.
Some people have obsessions for money, power, riches, and land. Obsessions for revenge and retribution are common. I've heard of people who were obsessed with finding the perfect photogenic tree or collecting manhole covers. But obsessed with finding fruit?

Those people must be crazy, right?

I mean, who else would travel deep in the Indonesian rainforest over looking for a rare strain of durian? Who would spend 20 years trying to cultivate the perfect mango? What person uses classic paintings and frescoes to search for rare olives and pears? Who in their right mind would spend several thousand dollars on a piece of fruit?

They are Fruit Hunters, and they are the subject of Yung Chang's fascinating and entertaining new documentary: The Fruit Hunters, based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/1476704996/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>&nbsp;of the same name by Adam Gollner.

The thing that set's The Fruit Hunters above your average cooking show/fruit documentary/Discovery channel movie is its amazing scope and the passion with which it is presented. Scope first. Chang shows us with brief but entertaining reenactments some pivotal moments in human history - the first human eating a fruit, how the McIntosh apple got it's name (a particularly beautiful apple tree was growing near Mr. John McIntosh's dead wife's grave), and how a whole Chinese empire fell due to the emperor's concubine's obsession for lychees, among other things. It is this special touch, albeit brief, that really impressed me with The Fruit Hunters.

Second thing that impressed me is, well, the fruit itself, and the passion of the people that give a good portion of their lives to finding, growing, cultivating, harvesting, and eating that fruit. The colours are so phenomenal they look like they could almost leap off the screen. The fruit is lush, vivid, beautiful, and so beautiful you could almost taste it. The greens are lush and rich, the reds and yellows tasty and lively, and the blues and purples deep and sensual. Apples, pears, cherries, mangoes, durians, pineapples, bananas, starfruit, strawberries, peaches, plums, rambutans, passion fruit, dragonfruit, ice cream beans, custard apples, breadfruit, and jackfruit NEVER looked so good, I tell you!

The people - the interviewees - are all colourful and obsessive, all with an interesting story to tell. There's the plantation owner dedicated to finding a new breed of banana able to be grown and sold all over the world. Living in China, I have eaten dozens of types of bananas over the years, but there is only ONE type of banana that is exported internationally - the Cavendish, and this breed is dying due to monoculture (Google it. It's an important topic!). There's star&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bill-Pullman/dp/B0012HF5NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bill Pullman</a>, who has a surprisingly deep relationship with fruit, whose odyssey to build a ""Hollywood Orchard"" is given light in this film. There's a tribesman who lives in the jungles of Indonesia, who tells of the fragile relationship between man and fruit. And many more.

In conclusion, The Fruit Hunters is an entertaining, if a little simple and non-groundbreaking, but informative and interesting documentary about one of the tastiest subjects. My rating? Four and a half ice cream beans out of five.

Now to actually get my hands on some of that juicy goodness. My favourite fruit is the mango. What's yours? Tell me in the comments!",1377302400,3,3606,5.473021582733813
5682054,5,B00BY8DKCM,"I've always enjoyed exotic fruit so it was a real pleasure to watch this movie. It includes a guy in Florida who's been trying to grow an exotic variety of mango for 20 years, hunts for fruit in the jungles of Indonesia, a woman in Italy who identifies figs from Renaissance paintings and searches for them in monastery orchards, actor Bill Pullman trying to create an orchard in Hollywood, and a man in Honduras trying to breed bananas more resistant to disease. Be sure to watch the credits where they identify all the fruits shown.

The movie talks a lot about sustainability but I think exotic fruits are just plain delicious. I've been fortunate enough to samplelychees, longans, durians, jackfruit, dragon fruit, different banana varieties, and my personal favorite the mangosteen. This film identified others I've never tasted such as the snake fruit, water apple, citrus caviar langsat, tampoi, akee, and so on. This brings me to my one problem with the movie. I saw a lot of wonderful fruit but I never got to taste them.",1374364800,,1030,4.8192090395480225
5682055,4,B00BY8DKCM,"This DVD came at a perfect time as I had just installed my new 39"" flat screen 1080 TV and bought a new Bluray Player.  Though the film is only being released on DVD (not BD), the images are sharp and colorful and a great test for the images of the new TV. And if you have an HD TV you will find your mouth watering from all the gorgeous images of unusual fruits.

But that's not enough to make you want to get this DVD, so I'll move on. My fellow Top 100 reviewer, K. Harris, has already covered some of the background on the 95-minute film so I'll try to add info, rather than repeat it.

As was noted filmmaker Yung Chung - director of the wonderful 2007 documentary ""Up The Yangtze ""traveled the globe to follow five ""fruit hunters"" - individuals who have a passion for finding unusual fruits. He travels to Indonesia, Honduras, Hawaii and California. The California connect give the film a ""Star"" attraction as it focuses on film actor Bill Pullman, who - for 20 years - has been raising his own fruit in the Hollywoodland hills. We even follow Pullman as he visits jungles and the locates exotic fruits in his own neighborhood.  He grows 100 varieties of fruit in his own backyard! There are fascinating stories about fruits we all know well like the banana. Did you know that only ON variety of banana exists today when there were many before the 1920s? And that there was a Chinese fruit grower named ""Bing"" who discovered the cherry which we now enjoy.

As Chang travels the world, subtitles (very easy to read) are used where English is not spoken. There are some re-enactments using actors but most of the time we follow the five ""hunters"". The film was produced in conjunction with the National Film Board of Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Company and the funding shows in the quality of the film.

I gave the film four stars because I like it a lot but I did find some scenes becoming repetitive and the film does feel longer than its 95-minute running time. But it's a fascinating - and beautiful - film.

There are no bonus features on the DVD other than the trailer. Not even a bio of the filmmaker.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8575471,1,B00BY8DKCM,"Spoilers beyond here. The book was fascinating because it dealt with fruit hunters' obsession with their quests and sometimes illegal activities in service of those quests, plus I learned a lot more about exotic fruits than I even had, including that the Gros Michel (the better-tasting banana variety we all used to eat) is by no means extinct, as I thought previously. The movie was a total snooze, especially as it focused on fruit-lover/actor Bull Pullman, who can't smell and therefore, because of the way taste works, can't taste well, so why doesn't he find himself a different hobby?? A lot of time was wasted on his trying to organize people to make a rocky 1-acre plot in Hollywood into a hippie fruit Mecca. That failed because the owners of course had better offers for the land. I'm sure this was known from nearly the very beginning, but like most awful documentaries, we were held in suspense about it until near the very end.",1424563200,,941,4.7439024390243905

8575473,5,B00BY8DKCM,"Usually don't review movies and such but really enjoyed ""The Fruit Hunters"" Learned a bit about fruit, but mostly enjoyed looking at all that that scrumptious looking delicious fruit that I have never seen before. Gave me pause not to be so cautious in trying new fruits and fruits from other countries. It also gives food for thought about the plain ole banana, and how there's just one kind, and how it's a good idea that they start to do something about it. Although I do believe they are trying as I saw in the movie. I was amazed that out of a whole load of banana's there was only 1 seed. I loved seeing the Hollywood Hills and the thought that they are actually growing fruit there is just great! The people who complained about this movie were looking for what? I haven't a clue, but I thought it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon...great...great...and great!",1390780800,,875,4.509433962264151

8575475,4,B00BY8DKCM,"I just finished watching this, which I missed when it played locally and have been anticipating with excitement for a while. I don't know all of the fruits in the film and ultimately feel like they could've focused on that more. I know a good variety of them; cherimoya (my favorite, I have a tree in the yard now), mangosteen, durian, atemoya, miracle berry, breadfruit, etc. I've learnt about all of these in my spare time and felt that the movie was a good introduction for newbies but came up shy on data for those wanting to learn. The interviews with the various gardeners were the most interesting part. Those expert opinions should've been utilized more; there're many rare fruit groups now and people that grow these in their gardens. Focusing on their exploits would've made this a hit for me. I'm going to borrow the book, I've skimmed through it and feel it will be more thorough. If anyone knows a detailed film, please share!",1381449600,,939,4.662650602409639
8575476,3,B00BY8DKCM,"The Fruit Hunters contains some interesting tidbits of information such as the origins of the Hass avocado, MacIntosh apple and Bing cherry, but in other sections seems like a disjointed film patched together without a coherent central theme.  Too much time on peripheral topics such as community gardens.  Not enough information for the serious fruit enthusiast or the scientifically-oriented viewer, but perhaps entertaining for fans of actor Bill Pullman.",1381276800,,458,5.6231884057971016
