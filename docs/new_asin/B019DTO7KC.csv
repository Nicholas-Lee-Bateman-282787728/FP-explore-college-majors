7570450,1,B019DTO7KC,"Got though 3/4 of the season and could take another second.  For the love of God when will ""edgy"" humor come to an end.  With the slight possibility of Carol Kane, none of the rest of these people (including the overrated Tina Fey - in charge of some of the worse seasons of SNL and a slew of poor movies) have the talent to pull off a comedy based on the horrific Cleveland kidnappings.",1487030400,,387,4.216216216216216

7570453,5,B019DTO7KC,Love this series on Netflix. Decided to order this for my mom who currently doesn't have Netflix.,1481846400,,97,4.764705882352941

7570456,5,B019DTO7KC,Show is amazing but the DVD menu has no words only pictures. First few views is a little weird trying to figure out what is what.,1476489600,,129,4.0
7570457,5,B019DTO7KC,Tooo Funny.  I laughed from beginning of first show to the last.  Shows actually funnier when watched a second (or third) time.,1475539200,,127,4.7272727272727275

7570459,5,B019DTO7KC,"This show is hysterical and sweet and clever all at the same time.  I hope there's a season two.  No special features on the DVD and the menu is just characters, no words. Who thought that was a good idea?",1472256000,,205,4.1
7570460,3,B019DTO7KC,"When I first heard that Tina Fey was producing a sitcom for Ellie Kemper from The Office I was already on board, and in the end I wasn't disappointed at all. I'm not going to write too much about synopsis of the show but the sitcom follows Kimmy Schmidt (Kemper) following her rescue from an underground bunker where she was kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader 15 years earlier. The rest of the cast is fantastic and includes Tituss Burgess as her roommate, Carol Kane as her landlord, and Jane Krakowski as her boss. If you're a fan of 30 Rock chances are you will enjoy this show as well. The season includes some great guest stars including Amy Sedaris (Strangers with Candy), Dean Norris (Breaking Bad), Tony winner Christine Ebersole, and Tina Fey herself.

The only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars is because of the DVD release. Lately it seems that some movie studios are extremely lazy when it comes to DVD releases and this a good example of one. As other reviews have mentioned the DVD menus consist of pictures/icons, so you don't know exactly what you're pushing right away. My biggest pet peeve is that none of the episode titles appear on the menus either, the viewer doesn't know the title of the episode or what episode number it is. There are also no special features. Other than that this is a funny show and I can't wait to see where the show goes next!",1469836800,4,1378,4.512
7570461,5,B019DTO7KC,Absolutely hilarious! Hoping for a season 2 and beyond.,1469404800,,55,5.222222222222222
7570462,5,B019DTO7KC,Brilliant! Hysterical! Kids of the 80s/90s will love this. It's very quick witted and you have to pay attention because there's literally a joke in about every line. Non stop laughs. Only half hour episodes so they go fast. Tina Fey strikes again! Highly recommended.,1469059200,,267,4.955555555555556
7570463,5,B019DTO7KC,"Such a great show! I'm a fan of great series like Breaking Bad, Dexter, etc..., but this one totally took me by surprise. Refreshingly original, and the characters are absolutely hilarious!! Ellie Kemper is a genius comedic actress and her side-kick Tituss Burgess is fantastic!

7570465,5,B019DTO7KC,"One of the best comedy series in a long time. Great concept, very smart, very funny, very silly, often very surreal, and totally addictive, with an excellent cast and spit-out-your-corn-chips laugh lines that come a mile a minute. Added bonus: fantastic music and songs, from the outrageously head-sticking theme song to the magnificently silly ""Pinot Noir."" Watch it.",1468108800,,368,5.362068965517241
7570466,5,B019DTO7KC,"I was sad when this series was moved to Netflix because I do not have that service; however, after reading the reviews of the series - it was worth the risk of getting the DVD because if you watched 30 Rock, this new series from Tina Fey delivers with loads of laughter.

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is about Kimmy and her new life after she was kidnapped for 15 years with three other women. After they are rescued, Kimmy decides to start a new life in NYC. Without a job or any friends, she quickly finds a job with an upper-class and neurotic woman named Jacqueline. In addition to that, she moves with an eccentric and lovable roommate, Titus. Although Kimmy wants to move on from her past life, her optimism and her lack of knowing how society is currently working (in all types of aspects)  - the series is original and superbly hilarious.",1466208000,4,843,4.503267973856209
7570467,5,B019DTO7KC,Just started watching last night.  Watched 4 episodes. My husband I and I both thought it was so funny!  So far so good so would recommend.  Love the actors in this!,1466208000,,165,4.258064516129032

7570470,5,B019DTO7KC,"Great show. Great characters. There are many shows out there with a great premise, but with poor choice of actors. This show has both a great premise and actors that fit the characters they play. It is also very funny. I found myself crying with laughter several times.",1465603200,3,269,4.625

7570472,1,B019DTO7KC,"The premise is pretty poor and the comedy is lacking, I wouldn't give this more than one star when you compare it to cheers or Seinfeld",1464998400,2,135,4.230769230769231
7570473,3,B019DTO7KC,"I enjoy Ellie Kemper when she appears on talk shows. I have no clue if she was in ""The Office"" or ""Parks & Rec"" and really don't care because I'm not a fan of either show and, I guess, I could look it up . . . but again don't care. Also, I do watch ""SNL"" and was a faithful viewer of ""30 Rock,"" but still consider ""SCTV"" and ""Fawlty Towers"" funnier by far and way more consistent throughout their shows (i.e., ""SNL"" each week is lucky if they have one or two sketches that are truly funny). So that's where I'm coming from going in just so you know.

The setup premise (and that may be an oxymoron) I do like for this series but, after watching eight episodes, they don't use it well enough. Then the whole ""fish out of Indiana in New York City waters"" could be played for far more laughs. I just felt this was like a lesser ""30 Rock"" with much the same sort of clever wordplay jokes that really never busted a gut (then again other than the Alec Baldwin's demented right-wing business persona and Tina Fey's interplay, I wasn't really laughing my head off watching ""30 Rock"" episodes and I'm pretty sure I saw every season's episode. I do love Tina Fey as Sarah Palin or her brilliant Mean Girls script and even her turn in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot this year so don't get me wrong on her). I think Kimmy Schmidt just is too forced. It's like Kimmy herself. She and the series try way too hard.

The actors are good actors. Not sure if the roles are all that well-developed. The script and some of the situations are just so dumb at times. This really could have been some incredible cutting edge stuff. I mean, we have a woman escaped from a cult rooming with an unemployed gay African-American Broadway actor living in a building owned by Latka's wife from ""Taxi."" Why it did not work for me, escapes me.

Anyway, I stopped at eight episodes and can't be bothered to continue so I'll let someone else figure out if the extras on the DVDs are worth forking out and buying Season 1.",1463356800,4,1979,4.3002680965147455

7570475,1,B019DTO7KC,"The Unflushable Kimmy Schmidt: Season 1.

Are you looking for plot? Character development? Nope, won't find it here. But you will find a constant stream of one-liners and cheap jokes making fun of fashionable stereotypes (no unfashionable stereotypes here: 99% of the cast is reassuringly white-just like all past Fey/Poehler/Carlock vehicles).The single non-white and consistently recurring character is Black...but non-threateningly, flamboyantly, stereotypically gay as well...just to stay within the Fey formula of comedic writing)  ""The Unflushable,"" er, ""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" is joyously politically correct (in what has become the reflexive whitebread sort of way -as was ""30 Rock""). To me, the Fey/Carlock universe is often unsettling and lacking relevance. It is like watching rich old Protestant guys trying to be cool by attempting to dance to James Brown: stiffly but earnestly, all the while arguing about ""just what is the good foot.""
I think that question was settled decades ago.

Also: why does Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, or Robert Carlock have such contempt for Indiana?

 Poehler's show at least had some ""heart"" to it. ""The Unflushable"" seems to be a retread for all the bad ideas that never made it into ""30 Rock""",1462406400,2,1240,5.371134020618556

7570478,4,B019DTO7KC,"If you like 30 Rock, you'll enjoy Kimmie Schmidt.

7570480,5,B019DTO7KC,"This is a great show and I'm glad that it is available on DVD. While the show is great, the DVDs are not. The person in charge of designing the DVD menu should be fired.

7570483,5,B019DTO7KC,This show is laugh out loud funny and incredibly smart and sweet.  I love all of the cast!  I wish they had released it on blu ray!  I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to laugh.,1458086400,2,191,3.973684210526316
7570484,5,B019DTO7KC,"This is a great show and I won't downvote it because the content is top-notch. However, I'd like to give the DVD release about 2 stars - there are ZERO special features on here, and the menus don't even have words!  All you get are icons for play/subtitles/etc - not even episode titles are included.

Ellie Kemper is perfectly cast as the title character. I can't think of another actress that could've played her any better. Kimmy. Kemper has great comedic timing, and her physical comedy is impeccable. This show was co-created by Tina Fey. I love the plot of this show, I love the talented cast, and I love the writing. THIS SHOW IS FLAWLESS. Buy. It. Now. Enjoy! P.S. The theme song is addicting!",1457395200,9,569,4.757575757575758
7570486,5,B019DTO7KC,"My expectations weren't very high on this show. I think Ellie Kemper is a little doll and I enjoyed the character she played on the ""Office"", so I gave it a shot. Being a Tina Fey produced show made me even more curious. THIS IS A REALLY FUNNY SHOW!!!!  Every episode is FUNNY!  If you're a 30 Rock Fan, you'll love the the same style humor this show has. The ""one liner's"" will crack you up. I already can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD, because THIS SHOW IS A KEEPER!!!",1456185600,5,479,4.085106382978723

8744853,3,B019DTO7KC,"I would probably give this show 3 1/2 stars. I like Ellie Kempers performance, but was disappointed in the show. 30 Rock is one of the best written sitcoms ever; therefore, I thought this Tina Fey series would have the same quality writing. Instead, the series is like a G-League 30 Rock, that seems to grapple with a small Netflix budget, rather than a Lorne Michaels approved NBC budget (and resources). Two 30 Rock cast members appear as regulars in this series, with Tina Fey and John Hamm making guest appearances in the last few court room episodes.
The main premise of the show seems contrived and the series would have been better off without it (four women were kept in an underground bunker by a doomsday charlatan cult leader). Ellie Kemper is a naturally charismatic actor and some of her dance moves in one episode made me laugh, but she is limited by this Cinderella written character.
Also, the theme song while catchy is based on a dated youtube/ news personality (whose 15 minutes are long up), and it seemed forced into the first show, when it could have been better utilized. Then it is used as the opening theme throughout the series and just comes across as perplexing wtf rather than an amusing callback. I think that the opening theme song vocals were even changed midway through the first season.

All in all, the show is sometimes amusing due to Ellie Kemper, but is nowhere in the same league as the (unheralded by the public) greatness of 30 Rock.",1524700800,,1474,4.647509578544061

Season two and three are simply unwatchable. The writers invest very little time or talent in the material of this show and it is too overtly cheap to overlook. What a shame as it was a great concept. The show quickly deteriorates to an asinine level of contrived stupidity perhaps palatable only to those who watch while heavily and I mean heavily intoxicated.,1519516800,,500,4.758620689655173
