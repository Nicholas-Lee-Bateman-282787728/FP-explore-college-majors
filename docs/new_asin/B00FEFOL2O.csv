8614776,5,B00FEFOL2O,"Jimmy Stewart plays a sort of Neil Simon type playwright with Rosalind Russell as his wife, comes to a conclusion that his comedies are too lightweight. He changes his direction and starts writing serious plays which also turns out to be boring. The film was directed by William Keighley and good performances of Jimmy Stewart, Rosalind Russell, Genevieve Tobin and Charles Ruggles turned this into a delightful film to watch.",1443657600,,426,5.1

8614778,3,B00FEFOL2O,"Stewart the cad?  This movie is a weird one that doesn't know whether to be comedy, romance, or drama.  Stewart seems likely a perfect fit for the folksy first time playwright but turns out miscast really as the movie spins off in a odd directions.  Russell is always good as she moves effortlessly from serious to funny, but the film misses.  The end seems tacked on and the pacing is slow, then fast, then slow again.  Just odd.",1423180800,2,430,4.461538461538462
8614779,4,B00FEFOL2O,"this tale is about a man from Utah, who wrote a play that makes it to the big stage on Broadway. Stewart is the author who is told to try a new style. Russell is the wife who tells him to stick with what he's done. Many twist and turns by the time it ends, what does he do?  get the movie and find out. I buy films based a lot on the actress, being male, I guess I gear toward female star power. However I am seldom disappointed with films with  James Stewart (or Cary Grant_",1409788800,2,475,3.88659793814433

8614781,2,B00FEFOL2O,"Is this a comedy? If it is, it is silly, unfunny and very boring. The two leading stars are wasted. Stewart gets on your nerves.  Only Louise Beavers and Charles Ruggles save the movie from total disaster.",1386547200,2,205,4.54054054054054
