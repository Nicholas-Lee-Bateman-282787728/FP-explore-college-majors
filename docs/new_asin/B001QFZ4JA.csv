8335625,1,B001QFZ4JA,"I bought this movie as a birthday gift for a young friend.  I am a huge fan of the movie and knew he would love it.  It was a few weeks before I saw him again, and when I asked how he liked the movie, I got a funny look from his mother.  She finally explained that it would not play on their DVD player and that there was a Region Code error message.  So I logged back into Amazon and pulled up my order.  There was a note in the posting about the Region Code that I had not seen before.  I don't know if I missed it or if it was added after I purchased the movie, but what a disappointment!  Please make sure you have a DVD player that will play the Region 2/PAL format before buying this movie.  I was so embarrassed that my gift was such a disaster :(",1364860800,5,754,3.8506493506493507
