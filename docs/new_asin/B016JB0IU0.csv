7474139,2,B016JB0IU0,Worth a watch could of been better  its notscary. At all kind of not make any sense.  Some times the movie cover on the dvds is better than  the movie when there that bad. Alot people are not going to. Like this  the reason is its annoying and the movie drags up to nothing,1454630400,,273,4.0
7474140,4,B016JB0IU0,This wasn't a bad flick. A lot of back and forth and you can kind of see the ending coming but still worth the watch.,1485561600,,117,3.72

7474144,5,B016JB0IU0,Loved the Original Soundtrack. Great acting by everyone. I enjoyed the cinematography. This plot was different. I give it 5 stars across the board.,1484352000,,147,5.166666666666667
7474145,1,B016JB0IU0,Dan't waste your time so bad it nearly put me in a coma lol,1484092800,,59,3.2857142857142856
7474146,2,B016JB0IU0,It was a little slow and unclear. But it was interesting the grounds around the house and the old car she drove. I thought it would have been a little better.,1483920000,2,158,4.129032258064516
7474147,5,B016JB0IU0,Ellie is a bonified nut case. didn't see nothing wrong with this movie,1483920000,,70,4.461538461538462
7474148,1,B016JB0IU0,Started out ok but kept going back and forth to the beginning. Been there done that get on with it.  Not a lot of lines to remember which makes it more of a silent movie too. Couldn't stand it anymore & turned it off.,1483574400,3,217,3.9318181818181817
7474149,1,B016JB0IU0,Just couldn't get interested in this movie.,1482796800,2,43,5.285714285714286
7474150,2,B016JB0IU0,super tame with a few jump noises,1482192000,2,33,3.857142857142857
7474151,5,B016JB0IU0,"I was surprised at how good this movie truly was. As someone else said, outstanding acting. It was very scary. Lots of crazy twists and turns. The ending was.....OMG!!!",1481846400,,168,4.827586206896552
7474152,5,B016JB0IU0,Want a ghost story?  Here it is.  The acting is very good too.  The script was a little Fellini but I didn't mind.  Loved the scenery and things that made it so period piece like the car and the little sister walking in high heels in the sand.  I would recommend it to anybody that likes a good ghost story.,1481673600,,307,4.05
7474153,1,B016JB0IU0,Slow story line. Sucked.,1478822400,,24,5.25
7474154,3,B016JB0IU0,The acting by Lucy Benjamin was outstanding. I gave it a three instead of a four because it was an extremely depressing movie; as such I couldn't really say I liked it let alone loved it.,1477612800,,187,4.222222222222222
7474155,4,B016JB0IU0,Keeps you guessing for a while about what is going on. Wraps up cleanly in the end.  Worth a watch.,1477526400,,99,3.95
7474156,4,B016JB0IU0,Very tense movie. A memory emerging in bits and pieces was very well done.,1477526400,,74,4.357142857142857
7474157,1,B016JB0IU0,"Absolutely the worst horror movie, and overall movie, I have seen in a long time. Totally disappointing and time-wasting.",1460937600,,121,5.421052631578948
7474158,1,B016JB0IU0,"Serious minded but painfully tedious thriller about a woman who goes to a seaside house with her sister after a traumatic event at her mom's that we see larger and larger snippets of as the movie progresses.  This was originally called Not Alone which isn't a great title but The Haunting of Ellie Rose was a major miscalculation since it gives away the movie's biggest twist.

In any case, this hopelessly muddled film suggests that Ellie was abused by her husband, or molested as a child, or that she and her sister were molested as children--but Ellie turns out to not be the most reliable or honest heroine, so it's hard to say what, if anything, is the reason for everything that is going on in this movie.  The only certain thing is that this is one seriously long slog of an 80 minute film that offers no suspense or dramatic interest--although the acting and evocation of a 1950's setting are pretty impressive for what was likely a pretty low budget movie.  Still, The Haunting of Ellie Rose is flat out boring, despite its genuine ambition, never managing to create a lead character we care about or understand, a story that is mildly involving or even a single scene that generates a little tension.  Ellie Rose is a depressing misfire.",1458432000,,1247,4.65
7474159,1,B016JB0IU0,"This is a confusing mess by design. Ellie Rose's mom  (Kika Mirylees) changed when she was a child. She has a sister Chloe (Alexandra Moen) who apparently mom liked best. Ellie (Lucy Benjamin) has flashbacks to her husband Frank (Bill Ward) apparently slapping her and causing a miscarriage, although the flashbacks hide faces. Then there was the night her and Chloe go to visit mom and she finds blood everywhere, and if you missed that flashback, wait as it is repeated as it takes up half the film.

As I watched the film I was confused as to what was flashback, what was real and what was the present, and what was a dream. In the end things did come together and the imagery made sense. I can even say it was smartly done for what they wanted to do. However the fact is I struggled through the film and wasn't entertained seeing the same faceless scenes repeated over and over. Nice era recreation. Did they have underground power lines to remote areas?

8736620,1,B016JB0IU0,I wanted to jump off my roof it was so boring.....dont waste your time!!!,1532390400,,73,4.285714285714286
8736621,1,B016JB0IU0,"I had high hopes since it was FilmRise but this was terrible. No dialogue just watching a woman wonder aimlessly through the whole movie. The whole movie consisted of images each one rather boring.  Not a horror movie, just a middle aged woman falling apart in boring images.",1514851200,,275,4.729166666666667
8736622,2,B016JB0IU0,I'm sorry I watched it for 30 minutes. And it didn't get any better for me. So I gave it at least 2 Stars normally I'd give it one. Way too boring for me. And I watch movies in different languages with subtitles and I couldn't sit through one in English.  That's pretty bad!,1495152000,,274,4.074074074074074
8736623,1,B016JB0IU0,"Stupid.  Hard to follow, too many twists.",1493337600,,41,4.857142857142857
8736624,3,B016JB0IU0,"The Haunting of Ellie Rose is an atmospheric thriller...possibly a bit too reliant on it's atmospheric elements at times. While this is what I tend to enjoy most about films like this, the intense stark overblown and rather shocking sounds and sights (as in Antichrist, Lovely Molly, etc.), this application was layered a bit thick. If you ever wondered what clothing being folded sounds like when recorded with an expensive shotgun microphone with the volume dimed on an even more expensive pre-amp...here's where you can find out. It sort of sounds like gravel sliding down a giant hill of styrofoam...spoiler alert. Sure, I get it, in fact being an audio engineer, I really appreciate it. She's all alone in what should be a tranquil quiet place. Building tension with stark overly intimate sounds, breaking the quiet in a disquieting way...but every sound amplified +12 db for effect, seems just well, uncomfortably loud and out of place at times. Oh and the shaking of the clearly rubber ax is a treat in a film so seemingly bent on enhancing the details. This aside! Has highly Hitchcock influenced production values (right down to the blood and the drain), visually intriguing, rather well acted, an interesting film, basically enjoyed it.",1493337600,,1246,5.024154589371981
8736625,2,B016JB0IU0,Not that good. Took me a while to actually finish it. Watched it in parts.,1490486400,,74,4.0
8736626,2,B016JB0IU0,It was very confusing and hard to follow.,1488067200,,41,4.25
8736627,3,B016JB0IU0,"I love Lucy Benjamin and would love to watch her in other flicks. However, I didn't enjoy watching her walk around the house, clean the house, and stroll along the beach for most of the movie. There are several animal carcasses thrown in, too, for foreshadowing, I guess. I've seen other movies with the same ending so it was predictable for me.",1487894400,,345,4.580645161290323
8736628,1,B016JB0IU0,"Love ghost stories but just couldn't make it... ten minutes in NOTHING had happened and I was losing it a little, especially as I find Australia a little depressing to start with. It lacks the powerful pomp and history of Britain or the vibrant powerful dynamic energy of America, its culture is too indistinct for such an isolated movie. How you function in that little shack, miles from anywhere, without game to hunt or the ability to grow food in the Outback is a mystery... and if you grew up there you'd be crazy by the time you were 11 I would assume. As for the movie, I could probably figure out the sequence of events of the flashbacks (that just loop on and on) but I lost the will too. Boring, boring movie.",1485734400,,719,4.373134328358209
