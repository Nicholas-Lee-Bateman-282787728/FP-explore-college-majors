7803598,5,6300167143,"Legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme serves up some authentic cajun dishes in this first video adaptation of his best-selling ""Louisiana Kitchen"" cookbook, including his tasty 'Blackened Redfish'. For those of you wishing to follow along at home, beware the following: 1. Mr. Prudhomme's recipes are sinfully delicious (no skimping on butter or cream here!) so if you're looking for healthy, low-fat, low-carb cooking, look elsewhere; 2. most of the recipes require quite a few ingredients (the spice mixes in particular) none of which are difficult to find at the grocery, but they may not be in the pantry of the average home cook. Throughout the video, Mr. Prudhomme's warmth and love of food shines clearly: you can tell he really does want to share his cooking secrets with you. It puts modern food television stars to shame. Highly Recommended.",1356652800,,853,5.143884892086331
7803599,5,6300167143,This was a great video and I enjoyed it very much. This is my second video of Chef Prudhomme and each one is a valuable source of great cooking information. You will be glad you purchased this one.,1221955200,,197,4.2105263157894735
