That a ""youth"" orchestra can perform on this level is not particularly surprising - the are certainly other examples - but that this hand-picked group of teenagers and young adults from Israel, Palestine and the surrounding Arab nations has been living and working together all summer, refining and polishing their performances and becoming friends and colleagues, when they might otherwise be on the streets trying to kill each other, is truly cathartic. Music is, indeed, the bridge between peoples, however antagonistic their other relations might be.
The performances here musically intense and technically flawless, clearly the work of many hours of rehearsal (some of Barenboim's gestures are sufficiently indecipherable you know his charges have had plenty of time to figure them out). This isn't the seasoned response of the Vienna Philharmonic or the virtuoso brilliance of the Chicago Symphony, but rather the excitement of these talented young players discovering the music and the joy of performing it with their new friends - and displaying their amazing skills and discipline in the process.
As with any ""live"" recording, there are occasional problems with balance and perspective, but overall the audio is excellent. As usual, though, the video is far too ""busy"" shifting about the stage and engaging in irrelevant close-ups of fingers on instruments and sweat on players' brows. Not nearly as bad as many others, though, so I didn't downgrade the rating.
More orchestras like this, more conductors like Barenboim, and more opportunities for the younger generation to question the long-standing antagonisms of their elders, and the world would be a much better place. And we lucky listeners would have even more inspiring performances like these to hear (and watch).",1509753600,,1835,5.397212543554007

8508750,4,B0052IGM0M,"When a performance is conducted by Daniel Barenboim, it is natural to expect good things.  In this case, he is conducting the West Eastern Divan Orchestra which consists of young musicians from Israel, Palestine, and various Arab countries.  And Barenboim and his musicians deliver.

The program consists of Beethoven's ""Leonore III"" Overture (Op. 72), Schoenberg's ""Variations for Orchestra (Op. 31)"", and Tchaikovsky's ""Pathetique"" Symphony (No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74).  A bonus is Mozart's ""Sonfonia concertante in E-flat Major, K. 297b.  The Beethoven is well performed, featuring some nice horn work from young people in the orchestra.  As for the Schoenberg...well...I'm not fond of Schoenberg and while the piece was played well, I have no desire to listen to it again.  This is my failing, not Mr. Barenboim's or the orchestra.  The Tchaikovsky, however, is really nice, and the string sections sound great.  Mr. Barenboim's conducting style is very direct and gently guiding, although it is very clear what he is expecting, when he is expecting it, and that the orchestra wants to give it to him.  Finally, the Mozart is just wonderful, featuring some delightful bassoon and oboe work from the orchestra, as well as really eloquent string work from the violins and violas.  Good stuff.

I enjoyed this disc, minus the Schoenberg, and am pleased to have it in my collection.",1344124800,7,1381,5.116071428571429
