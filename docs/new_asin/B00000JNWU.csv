A cruise on a luxury liner of any length is not for everyone. I'm an old sailor & enjoy the days at sea. Cruising is the only way I vacation until I run out of ports. The stops range from the regulars such as Rio, Singapore, Hong Kong & Hawaii. But there are also little known places like Salavador Brazil, the island of Mauritius & Korea. The logistics for such a cruise are an immense challenge not unlike preparing for war. All on the Queen Elizabeth II the biggest & finest cruise ship afloat in its time.",1252195200,,660,4.373983739837398
7913144,3,B00000JNWU,"Since the QE2 has been sold and '08 is her last year as a cruise ship (she's to become a floating hotel in Dubai), this video, no doubt, will become a nostalgic classic. I have done one transatlantic crossing and one Mediterranean cruise on the QE2 and love her. This film from '89 is definitely dated but still shows much of what the ship has to offer and I enjoyed Doug Jones' wry  sense of humor! The ports of calls on this World Cruise were very exotic to one who has not been to South America or Asia and I found them fascinating. The colorful landscapes were beautiful and not as grainy as the filming on board the ship. The film ends with the QE2 sailing into NYC harbor showing both the Statue of Liberty and the Twin Towers reminding us of a skyline no longer with us.",1186444800,,777,4.25
7913145,1,B00000JNWU,"Being a Cunard aficionado and traveled transatlantic on this beautiful ship, I bought this video to compare notes.
This was filmed 20 years ago and today is so grainy, high in contrast, and so 60's, it's painful to watch.
Doug Jones voice is so monotonic, we fell asleep often trying to get through it.
There is another VHS available here ... with Cunard's logo on it in Manhattan.  Filmed closer to 1995, it's a far better value and we could actually recognize aspects of the ship!
