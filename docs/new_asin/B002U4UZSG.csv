3987227,5,B002U4UZSG,"Great movies this is like having chocolate and pizza. Richard Pryor is a legend and these films show it, but the real unexpected surprise was Pryor's performance in Greased Lightning. It is truly an underrated performance and he deserved an Oscar for this performance I'm not going to spoil it, but seeing is believing truly a great actor/comedian.",1313193600,7,348,5.017241379310345
3987228,5,B002U4UZSG,I bought this movie combo as the best way to get a DVD of Uptown Saturday Night.  It also includes Moving (a pretty funny film in its own right) and two other movies I may or may not ever watch.  But that doesn't matter.  It was the cheapest way to get two movies I really like on DVD.,1306022400,,285,3.8793103448275863

3987298,5,B002U4UZSG,"Here are four great films starring Richard Pryor including Greased Lightening, The Mack, Uptown Saturday Night, and my favorite... Moving!
For about the price of one single movie this includes all four and that is a bargain in my opinion.
I love these ""collections"" because they take up a lot less shelf space and they're all together so we can watch one per night if we want.",1341792000,,376,4.626865671641791
3987299,5,B002U4UZSG,"I was looking for Moving when I found this Richard Pryor 4-movie set. It's almost the same price as buying Moving by itself, but this way you get an extra 3 movies to enjoy, so I'll say it's good value for your money.",1331769600,2,217,4.069767441860465
3987300,3,B002U4UZSG,"I already had a copy of The Mack on DVD, and Greased Lightning on VHS.  I basically purchased this because of the excellent price, and thought I'd give the other two movies a go.  After all, Moving seems to have rave reviews on here.

The Mack and Greased Lightning are great and well worth the purchase.  Uptown Saturday Night I think I've seen maybe twenty years ago but haven't had a chance to watch it yet.  I have to say though that I turned Moving off before it even reached the end of the film.  This would be one of the least funny comedies I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt embarrassed for the actors.  I guess if you like National Lampoon you might like it.

Greased Lightning is the story of NASCAR legend Wendell Scott.  It also stars Pam Grier and Beau Bridges.  It has its faults but overall it is a good movie.  The Mack is a classic of its genre.  I am hoping that Uptown Saturday Night will not disappoint but I can't recommend Moving.",1316563200,2,969,4.263736263736264
