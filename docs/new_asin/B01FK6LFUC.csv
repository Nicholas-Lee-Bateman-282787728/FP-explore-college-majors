8760910,3,B01FK6LFUC,"Haven't seen Everly, but its trailer seems to fit the package billing as an action set but not sci-fi?  Ex Machina is an arguably brilliant speculative fiction film, but it may be the antithesis of an action film:  more like a slow-burn suspense thriller. So the ""Sci-Fi"" and ""Action"" labeling may be a bit off, but the ""Women"" part looks solid. Since I haven't seen Everly, the star rating has little meaning, but the set is currently (as of 2-2-2017) is currently overpriced compared to buying the individual Blu-ray packages.",1485993600,,528,4.855555555555555
