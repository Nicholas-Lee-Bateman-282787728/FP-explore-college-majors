3673713,5,B001KWHO9W,"Gomorrah is an unforgettable film. Its theme is certainly the Camorra, the powerful criminal organization, but what makes this film so memorable, such an unforgettable experience is its artistic value, the power of every single scene. For Matteo Garrone, a former director of photography, every scene is a painting in motion. Unforgettable close-ups, upsetting and disturbing, this is a unique film.",1237334400,21,399,5.557377049180328
3673714,3,B001KWHO9W,"GOMORRAH is a film from Italy that has won many awards in Europe.  Now in theaters (and the increasingly simultaneously available 'On Demand' versions on television) this film is a long, near documentary of the crime milieu in Naples, Italy.  Based on the bestselling book by Roberto Saviano (written for the screen by the 'committee' composed of Maurizio Braucci, Ugo Chiti, Gianni Di Gregorio, Matteo Garrone, Massimo Gaudioso, and Roberto Saviano  himself), the film is less a story than an expos of the extent of crime as it infects every aspect of the underbelly of Naples.  Matteo Garrone directs this overlapping montage of glimpses into the many aspects of cruelty and variations of crime that affect both children and the elderly and everyone in between.

Though the film does utilize some fine actors (whose acting is so excellent that they seem like figures caught in the propulsive and deadly way of life as crime breeds crime and the only true end of a session is death), the dialogue is sparse and the viewer is allowed little insight into the personalities of the various Mafioso-like crowd.  Yes there are some exceptions, especially among the young boys who by necessity become involved in the dirty deeds of their elders, but for the most part the film is focused on violence without interruption.  And if the viewer has little tolerance for gore and killing then this is a film to avoid.  Perhaps reading Saviano's popular book could help make this very long song meaningful.  The film does benefit from some fine cinematography, but even if that aspect of the movie could have given an occasional break with some of the sights of beauty in the city of Naples to break the near monotony of violence, GOMORRAH would be a better film.

3673715,4,B001KWHO9W,"A stark ultra realistic film about the organised crime operations of the Naopolitan ""Mafia"", called The Camorra.  Do not expect ""The Sopranos"" or ""Goodfellas"" in style, no slick lines or flashy clothes.

I found it to be well done and the acting is excellent but overall it was so dark that it left me feeling depressed.

However on the contrary the movie is not very violent, there were 3 or 4 scenes of violence (nothing graphic).....and the movie did not appear to have any direction and ends on somewhat of a flat note.  The fact that the movie indicate a English version.....there was not.

But I give it a 4, just for one thing, and it's with the subtitles, only had English and could of take aventage putting some extra subtitles or something, multiple subtitles, into the Blue ray, which has more space than standard dvd. Like if i wanna watch it with
a relative who might not understand the language but could read subtitles. Enjoy it even more, so not need to tell some of the stuff being said at times.(which i'm not really good at) Even tho, it's understandable, by seeing what goes on in the film.

3673749,1,B001KWHO9W,"I am a mafia movie buff.  I've seen just about every mafia movie out there be they in color or black and white.  I'm also a film buff in general.  And not only was this the worst mafia movie imaginable...but one of the worst movies I've ever seen, ever.  They are really just capitalizing on the fact that its one of the very few mafia movies out there that takes place in italy and is actually about the native italian mafia, that and the fact that they got martin scorcese to present it somehow, though he did not direct it!

So why did this movie suck so bad?  The story line is very loose and hard to follow, theres not a lot of character development, its very scattered, and many of the characters are hard to tell apart.  Its also very difficult to get into because you really don't know what the hell the movie is about for the first half of the movie at least.  And then it ends suddenly with you wondering what you just watched.  Martin Scorcese presents this movie probably because he was paid to do so because it certainly is not worthy of his presentation and he definately had nothing to do with the movie I've seen all of his movies and they are top notch.  This movie may be an independant film and have some good film techniques used but the directing, cinemetography, plot line and story, characters, and some of the acting are all about as bad as it gets.

Don't bother watching this movie you'll just be frustrated you just wasted over 2 hours of your time on it.  I don't see how anyone would possibly enjoy it, whether you are a film connoisseur or just someone who likes watching movies, you will either be bored  or angered by this movie.",1444176000,,1661,4.336569579288026

3673754,4,B001KWHO9W,"Gomorrah is a moving crime film about betrayal and the price of membership in organized crime. It's well-acted, and filled with intense and in many cases, disturbing images about violence in Southern Italy. I'm sure that the director watched Steven Soderbergh's Traffic when working to weave these stories on this tapestry.

The problem I have with the film is that it can be difficult to keep all of the stories and characters straight, since there are so many in this film.",1434240000,,475,4.864197530864198
3673755,5,B001KWHO9W,"Gomorrah' is a starkly realistic film that lives and breathes its subject  and it shows in every frame.  It is a detailed and realistic look at the lives and activities of those involved in Camorra, the Naples crime syndicate. The film's opening scene of shooting in a tanning salon, filmed in a style that refuses to sensationalize the subject matter, sets the tone and background of what follows in this bleak crime drama.

What follows is the five portrayals of people whose lives are touched by the Neapolitan Camorra syndicates: a cash carrying middleman; a 13-year-old delivery boy joining the syndicate; a college graduate who gets a job at a Camorra-controlled waste management; a tailor working for a factory (connected to Camorra), who secretly trains Chinese garment workers; and two reckless young boys (and ""Scarface"" fans) stumbling upon weapons hidden by the syndicate.

Whether we are settling in on the lives of two reckless teens or a seemingly respectable businessman, `Gomorrah' knows how to lace each confrontation with an air of uneasiness that works wonders on the outworking of the script. This is a top notch ensemble with vivid imagery and a haunting quality one soon won't shake.

The five narrative threads attempt to cover the wide range of organized crime activities, sometimes with the camera dwelling on the characters and their behaviors. Shocking events are often described with a very dry, almost documentary-like approach. The director presents the characters as parts of the huge system, in which each individual's presence means nothing.

It is a story about modern day mafia and the way they operate in Italy.  It seems that entire lives of people revolve around corruption and favors. Every aspect of life is touched by mafia:  from dress making business, to toxic waste dumping in every available valley around private properties whose owners are desperate for quick cash. There are dealings with drugs and guns. There are clubs where debts get settled... Some of the statistics at the end of the movie are mind boggling. The number of murders gangs are committing the amount of money mafia makes in drugs; the way money gets re-invested in the legitimate business ventures. And all of this is not work of fiction but the real life of so many impoverished people whose friends one day can turn into instant enemies the next day.  We know all these characters are doomed from the beginning. We know there is no hope here. What the bleak world of ""Gomorra"" offers is at best uncertain future.

This is a very powerful film that will give a view of society and realities that are often ignored and dismissed. It is a very powerful reflection of the lives of poor and uneducated who are doing whatever it takes to survive. Each man (and woman) is on their own to make choices that can lead them to very different lifestyle. Many times it is not by choice but by necessity.",1431043200,,2909,4.894308943089431

But if you believe in his method of stringing together disperse narratives, you really should see this. There is a driving sense of anger behind this film about a criminal cartel that, among other things, pushes drugs and dumps toxic waste. To me the saddest point is when two nave young men discover a cache of firearms and think it will be their fortune, make them immortal, allow them to pull off awesome heists, when in fact it's far more likely that this will spell their doom.",1417737600,,628,4.469565217391304

3673781,3,B001KWHO9W,"In general there is nothing wrong with this film at all. Its extremely well made in a very documentary style that literally feels like real events being captured on film. The acting is dead on. These feel like real people, not actors. The few moments of violence are not in any way operatic or produced to feel entertaining, but its very much in line with what seems naturally real. The plot is often a bit disconnected and its difficult to follow in the sense that I couldn't grasp some of the subject matter or figure out why some characters were deeply part of the film, such as a garment manufacturer and how the film covers his life as the overseerer of a factory employing chinese workers. I couldn't understand why the chinese had to hide him in the trunk of their car or why they or he would be a target of violence. I must have missed something. The film takes the audience on a ride that begins in the middle of a tense and violent situation. Watching this film seemed like catching a glimpse of a crime on the news and then wanting to see more on the story because I wasn't fully aware of the whole story or understood why much of it was happening. I didn't understand why a man delivering money who was unarmed and seemed totally harmless would be a target either. The film seems to suggest that either he is a target because hes delivering drug money and hes afraid he might be robbed, or was hes fearful of capture by the police. The film confused me a little. I also felt it was a little boring to be frank. Other than that its a very well made film that takes the realism of the mafia in cinema to a level seldom seen.",1367884800,,1634,4.29126213592233

3673785,3,B001KWHO9W,"I purchased Gomorrah on a blind buy, hearing something about it, and its praise of the mob in Naples. Now gangster movies, while not my favorite genre, I like, especially Goodfellas and The Godfather, but who doesn't love those? Gomorrah starts out very promising, with an opening sequence that leaves you excited, baffled, and wanting to see what happens next. But what happens next really has nothing to do with the opening scene, or the next scene, or the next scene. Gomorrah, tires, to tell five different stories: Toto, a 13 year old longing to be in the clan, Pasquale, dress maker who goes into the Chinese market, Don Cico, who carries the money from clan to business, Marco and Sweet Pea, two hotheaded teenagers who long to have a clan of their own, and Roberto, a college student who works for a man in the waste management business. The film shows how the gang violence and war between the clans effects each other these peoples lives. The result is an overly long, and overstuffed movie with just too much going on at once and no central plot driving the movie and keeping it interesting. Oh yes, there are individual plots within each of the five stories, but I feel that the director failed at bringing all these stories together and having them intertwine or at least have some meaning to the other stories. To be honest, I only cared about Toto, who the movie could have been easily about, Marco and Sweat Pea, just because how funny and reckless they were, and Pasquale, because who doesn't love a good car chase scene? But really, the movie could have found it's main character with Toto, because he was easily the most likable character in the whole movie, and built the other stories around his main story. I guess it all comes down to ones taste. Yes, the action and killing was thrilling and well done, but the story, if there even is one main story, fell a bit flat, and failed to keep me interested the whole way through. There was just too many stories to keep up with, and in the end, I only cared about three of them. Was the movie good? Yes, it was okay, but it left me a bit disappointed, for I was hoping for a better story with richer characters that fueled the action, not have the action the star, fueling the stories.",1345420800,2,2253,4.511002444987775
3673786,4,B001KWHO9W,"Golden Globe-nominated Italian film ""Gomorra"" (2008) is a detailed and realistic look at the lives and activities of those involved in Camorra, the Naples crime syndicate. The film's opening scene of shooting in a tanning salon, filmed in a style that refuses to sensationalize the subject matter, sets the tone and background of what follows in this bleak crime drama.

What follows is the five portrayals of people whose lives are touched by the Neapolitan Camorra syndicates: a cash carrying middleman; a 13-year-old delivery boy joining the syndicate; a college graduate who gets a job at a Camorra-controlled waste management; a tailor working for a factory (connected to Camorra), who secretly trains Chinese garment workers; and two reckless young boys (and ""Scarface"" fans) stumbling upon weapons hidden by the syndicate.

The five narrative threads attempt to cover the wide range of organized crime activities, sometimes with the camera dwelling on the characters and their behaviors. Shocking events are often described with a very dry, almost documentary-like approach. The narrative and visual style of ""Gomorra"" is totally different from those of ""The Godfather"" and ""City of God."" Director Matteo Garrone presents the characters as parts of the huge system, in which each individual's presence means nothing.

Thus it is sometimes hard to follow each story, partly because there is no ""story"" to follow, that is, a story in the traditional sense. We know all these character are doomed from the beginning. We know there is no hope here. What the bleak world of ""Gomorra"" offers is at best uncertain future.",1344816000,,1621,5.250965250965251

3673788,5,B001KWHO9W,"Tapestry films are really a dime a dozen these days.  There was a time when it felt like they were few and far in-between and so the luxury of an excellent one was a rare treat.  Now, it feels like almost every director wants to use this vehicle as a form of expression and it has brought with it a stigma that is hard to shake.  Still, when one gets everything right, it is hard to begrudge it, especially when the formula or `style' is necessary to the unraveling of the film's plot.

Case in point, `Gomorrah'.

This is not a film that could have been told without this distinctive structure.  It needed to have multiple angles from multiple viewpoints to fully unearth the core of this film, and so watching it, it becomes apparent that this `tapestry' of sorts is the film's largest ally.  Basically, this is what would have happened had `The Sopranos' veered away from intimate details of one family and tried to flesh out the entire operation.  Obviously, this takes place in the heart of Italy and not in New Jersey, but the obvious similarities, especially when taking a look at the way those sausage fingers dip into everything (and the apathetic foolishness that dwells in the heart of the youth here) are undeniable.

`Gomorrah' is a starkly realistic film that lives and breathes its subject (the film's director, Matteo Garrone, has even been accused of getting involved with the mob in order to make this film) and it shows in every frame.  Whether we are settling in on the lives of two reckless teens or a seemingly respectable businessman, `Gomorrah' knows how to lace each confrontation with an air of uneasiness that works wonders on the outworking of the script.  This is a top notch ensemble with vivid imagery and a haunting quality one soon won't shake.  I highly recommend to those wanting a fresh take on earth's oldest profession (oh wait, that's prostitution...which is kind of the same thing).

Oh, and Toni Servillo is astonishingly good, especially that roadside confrontation.",1341273600,,2008,4.76878612716763
3673789,3,B001KWHO9W,"here is a difference between realistic films, such as those made by John Cassavetes, and cinema verit, or films that try to approximate realism. Realistic films know they are fiction, but nonetheless mimic reality for the sake of art, whereas cinema verit attempts to fool viewers into thinking it is real. Matteo Garrone's 2008, 137 minute long gangster film, Gomorrah (Gomorra), is the latter sort of film, and in its attempt at fooling the viewer lays bare its artifice, as well as its essential failure, insofar as making any claims on greatness. This is not to say it is a bad film, just not a great one. It is a good film, with interesting moments, but far too often the film's multiple characters and stories are wanly sketched and inspire no care, much less recognition, and the action unfolds in a wholly anomic manner. In fact, little of it actually unfolds, and this lack of action; real action, inner action- not bang bang action- makes the film, at its worst, quite boring. Some critics have attempted to call the film Neo-Neo-Realism, but this isn't apt. Nor are the claims that this is a Mafia film. It's not. In fact, it's a Camorra film, and the Italian Camorra (the play on words, with the rhyming Gomorrah, is as forced as it is heavyhanded), based in Naples, is different from the Sicilian-based Mafia, in that, whereas the Mob, and most other organized criminal groups operate in the hierarchical vertical structure of a Family, the Camorra operates in a more horizontal, cell like structure. The Camorra, therefore, has more in common with terrorist groups, such as Al Quaida, in that it centers less power with individuals. But, none of this trivia matters to the film- although many bad critics love to trumpet the factoids they gleaned from press releases or a good Google search as if that made up for the film's lack.",1340236800,2,1844,4.765625
3673790,5,B001KWHO9W,"This film is produced by Martin Scorcese and directed by an Italian director.  It is made in Italy with Italian actors and in Italian language.  It is a story about modern day mafia and the way they operate in Italy.  Story is set in Naples and there are some scenes of Venice too.  We learn through eyes of a young boy, middle aged man and two young punks of the ways men earn their living in place where unemployment is the norm.  Some of the scenes are shot in the housing projects where drug dealers have their regular clientele.  We see that people can serve mafia for 40 years in various capacity.  But when those same mafia members attempt to protect their own children from the life of crime and murder, their children end up being unemployed for decades.

It seems that entrie lives of people revolve aroung corruption and favors.  Every aspect of life is touched by mafia: from dress making business (houte couture) where dress making is displayed in magnificent evening gowns worn by mvie stars during movie awards, to toxic waste dumping in every available valley around private properties whose owners are desparate for quick cash. There are dealings with drugs and guns.  There are clubs where debts get settled...  Some of the statistics at the end of the movie are mind boggling.  The number of murders gangs are committing the amount of money mafia makes in drugs; the way money gets re-invested in the legitimate business ventures.  And all of this is not work of fiction but the real life of so many impoverished people whose friends one day can turn into instant enemies the next day.

This is a very powerful film that will give a view of society and realities that are often ignored and dismissed.  It is a very powerful reflection of the lives of poor and uneducated who are doing whatever it takes to survive.  Each man (and woman) is on their own to make choices that can lead them to very different lifestyle.  Many times it is not by choice but by necessity.",1339372800,,1985,4.59375

3673796,2,B001KWHO9W,"I actually watched this about a year ago and was thoroughly disappointed. Typically when that happens, I decide to wait an extended period of time to give something I REALLY wanted to like a second try. In the interim I actually decided to buy the book to see if that would help me gain a new perspective on things.  A year later and I just finished watching Gomorrah for a second time.  Unfortunately, I still feel the same way I did after the first viewing.  There are no characters to latch on to and the storylines are extremely disjointed.  While the book definitely helps fill in some of the blanks - overall I still found this film very lacking.

It's one thing to accurately depict the miserable conditions people caught up in that vicious cycle, (either by choice or not) have to face.  This movie most definitely gets major kudos for presenting the harsh realities of what life is like when surrounded by lifetime criminals.  But it's another thing entirely to engage the viewer more.

I guess I would finish by saying as a movie, I found Gomorrah ineffectual because it failed to entertain on any level. (And by entertain, I know this is pretty horrific subject matter).  I suppose if you go into this looking for a beefed up documentary type film, you could possibly think this is great. But if you go into this looking for a story to be told that has a plot line and character arc/development you'll be left very wanting indeed.",1319760000,,1441,4.575875486381323

I didn't really know much about the movie but the general premise (a look at the Italian mob in Napoli) was good enough for me to pick it up. Boy, am I glad I did.

""Gomorra"" (137 min.; original release in Italy in 2008; for reasons unknown to me this is listed as ""Gomorrah"", even though the movie clearly shows ""Gomorra"" as the movie title) brings a number of intersecting stories about the ""underworld"" (the translation of ""Gomorra"") in and around Naples. No point in trying to telling the main story lines, as they are complex as the movie evolves, but as you may gather, none of it is good news. The acting is superb all around, and I was absorbed watching this movie from start to finish.

In all, what a great movie this is. No, it's not for the faint of heart, as there are some hard to watch scenes. In a way, this is Italy's modern-day version of ""The Godfather"", without Hollywood's big stars. But equally, if not more so, satisfying.

3673805,5,B001KWHO9W,"Gomorra is based on Roberto Saviano's 2006 book of the same name, an expose on the criminal syndicate of Naples, but with a very personal element to the story.  The book read something like an extended personal essay about how crime permeates nearly every aspect of society in modern-day Naples, especially the depressing concrete suburbs that are home to the world's largest open-air drug market.  Hailed as exceptionally brave, the book prompted death threats to the author, who has since lived under 24-hour police protection.

The cinematic version of the film completely removes Saviano's personal story, though this does not harm the impact of the film.  In fact, this is one of the most impressive looks at a modern crime organization I've ever seen, and it's easily one of the grimmest.  Both book and film should be read and watched by anyone interested in true crime or wanting to know anything about the realities of modern-day Italy.

The film is broken into five separate stories that are ultimately connected, underscoring the criminal underworld's influence on every sector of society.  The proceedings will be a bit confusing to those not familiar with the source, since nothing is immediately explained.  Over time, as the stories jump around, the conflicts emerge.  The plot lines are as follows: a young man begins to apprentice with a businessman who makes deals to dump garbage and toxic waste all over the Italian countryside; a young boy begins his career as a young Camorra gopher and lookout; an older gentleman delivers money to the widows and families of jailed Camorra associates until a shooting war breaks out; a talented tailor risks his life as he begins sharing his secrets with the Chinese tradesmen who comprise his competition; and two young, Scarface-obsessed teen wannabe gangsters decide to make their mark as they run afoul of the local mobsters.  Saviano is nowhere to be seen, though his personal observations and obsessions are woven into every story.

While many crime films inevitably glorify their subjects to some degree, Gomorra is hardly a glamorous portrait of the concrete suburbs of Naples, which bear more than a passing resemblance to troubled American housing projects and inner-city ghettos.  It is a grim and troubling place that may change one's opinion of European civility for some time.  The stark style---real locations, natural life, real locals---underscores a desperate, cannibalistic society where crime is simply a way of doing business, and nobody even enjoys the spoils.  Rather than having a Mafia/Cosa Nostra-type structure, the Camorra is a clan-based business society of sorts where everything and everyone has a price, 'rules' are few and far between, and violence is the easy cure for any conflict.  Even the sides on the shooting wars are completely murky since nobody can be trusted.  All anyone can agree on is that there needs to be some killing.  The desperation of the environment dictates there be an endless supply of wannabes who hope to distinguish themselves amid the drab concrete landscape.

There is little to none of the 'honor' and 'loyalty' that American Mafia films try to depict.  In fact, this society has tossed those considerations out the window.  The 'dons' here do not sit in wood-paneled studies, considering the loyalty and respect of friends while spouting aphorisms.  In fact, they are never seen.  Rather, the street-level powers dress like gangster rappers, have a taste for gaudy jewelry, and have no qualms about putting a bullet in anyone's head---man, woman, or child.  This is not Scorsese, or Coppola, or the Sopranos, with signature flourishes and well-coordinated soundtracks underscoring the nefarious activity.  Gomorra is a bleak, gray world where everything, literally, is touched in a figurative or physical way by crime.  The countryside is poisoned, the people live in terror, the authorities have minimal success combating the plague, and the aspirations of many of the young generation are limited to becoming the next bagmen, triggermen or body bag inhabitant.  One of the most powerful moments does not involve a mob hit or any blood, but rather highlights the rather depressing origins of one of those sparkling gowns star actresses wear to the Oscars.

Highly recommended film.  It was snubbed for Oscar consideration, perhaps because we need 'nice' foreign movies to consider.  This may blow your conceptions of European life out the door, and of course, it's a living story as the Italian authorities attempt to chip away at the worldwide power of the Camorra and everything they touch.  Gomorra is even opens with a warning about tanning beds!  The Criteria Collection release is very welcome for a new film.

Italy is also dirty, violent and full of fear and oppression, orchestrated by incompetent politicians and intellectuals scared and running (as the author of the novel that the script is based on). The working class has given up on job prospects and deal in dope and death. Blocks of apartments function as fortresses for the underclass mob soldiers. Two young kids are our fix points and we follow an actual hand full of main characters in a web of stories - a style developed by the late master director, Robert Altman. In 'Gomorrah' we learn that from the bottom to the top, Napoli/Italy/Europe seems entangled in crime, drugs and corruption. An early, ugly death is always right around the corner - illegal guns (for hire) are everywhere. As is toxic waste, worth it's price in gold if you can get it 'disposed of' - and no problem, the mafia will do the job, complete with child labor, illegal immigrants and smooth talk, with a threat lurking right underneath the surface. Master acting takes place here, some of the best actors around do great work in this movie! Young and old. Another story shows beauty unfold in the haute couture and T-shirt section of this old, industrial city Naples in decay and simultaneous transformation, yet still ruled by almost prehistoric brutality and cynicism. One of Italy's core industries, clothes production, is being taken over by Chinese immigrant factories - here we see the consequences... from the innocent boy and the sublime but exploited tailor to the lowest, psychopathic killer - the 'Camorra' - Napoli's deep rooted mafia dynasty/network of families - control everything!
Fantastic interview disc is extremely informative and adds tremendously to this package. Totally worth the time and money (the movie is not for the kids and it's loooong, yet not a minute too long, so set aside a whole evening, send the children to bed early - and then enjoy). This film's images and themes keep popping up in the mind, weeks after you watch it - it's really grabs you and won't let go... so I do not hesitate  recommending it highly. A true masterpiece!

3673810,3,B001KWHO9W,"Gomorrah is an Italian film directed by Matteo Garrone based on the book by Roberto Saviano. It deals with the Neapolitan crime syndicate known as the Camorra, which is based in Naples. According to end credits they are very influential and have contributed to 4000 deaths in the last few years. Their business interests are spread all over the world and have invested in the reconstruction of the Twin Towers. In the intertwining tales of two rude teenagers, delivery boy, a businessman and a tailor, Gomorra paints a life that is in Naples. The Wire did that so successfully with its depictions of society and the gangs and the line that that blurs between them. You have basically four stories and they all run parallel so it takes a little while to get used to the goings on especially if you do not speak Italiano and your eyes are constantly shifting from the subtitles to the action on screen. The delivery boy lives in a housing development and shows a affinity for the mob, the businessman has a apprentice who is learning the ropes of illegally dumping waste and gets a awakening about the kind of life that he is going to lead, the tailor known for his prowess with fabrics is clandestinely hired by the Chinese to train them and faces the brutality of the mob when they find that he is aiding a competitor and finally the two teenagers who are so full of themselves that they mess with the wrong people and the repercussions that they face.

3673812,5,B001KWHO9W,"A great film - great writing, acting, directing, cinematography. The plot is made up of 5 different stories, two of them connected by location. Five standalone stories that basically only have one thing in common, their setting - the region of Campania - the land of the Camorra. The seemingly randomness of the story structure does two things to the viewer: makes Gomorrah a little hard to follow and lends authenticity to the unfolding of the tale.  The unique story structure coupled with the fact that the movie is in Italian (with english subtitles) may make it hard for some to follow (according to my slightly inebriated friend, ""Dude, I'm totally lost and this movie's still awesome."") The complicated plot can be easily mastered by watching the DVD extras- this being a Criterion review the extras are numerous and great- namely the interviews with Roberto Saviano who authored the book that the film is based on. The extras are fantastic and truly only add to the  cinematic experience.

Remember, this is not Goodfellas in Naples. Gomorrah has five distinct stories to achieve a wider scope, a panorama of corruption.

by Toni Servillo, suggests that Italy's economy is failing from a

attributable to a higher priced currency  (Euro) resulting  in a
much higher cost of living, while the earnings  of the working
class has either stayed the same,  gotten worse or been made more

unmonitored, laissez faire economics in regards to society,

mental, emotional and  character depth. Viewers are not told
whether the people are to blame, the lack of local opportunities in
a unified Europe and free trade world, or simply the deteriorated
quality of life for the working class in Italy overall.

It succeeds in showing the human dependency between various
individuals, a social hierarchy such that extortion payments are
enforced from some to others. The author zooms into aspects of
misery, drug trafficking, unemployment, lookouts and pushers on
street corners, and rooftops, the childen looking up to gangsters

religious, or educative instruction in the citizens, admiration for

spraying bullets from Ak-47 or Uzi's in their plain underwear.)

Next, the soundtrack lacks conviction, sophistication and
character, existing at most simply to substitute total silence. The
filming is widescreen, which is a plus, and although crystal clear,
fails to show enough of Naples or the countryside to do a
reality-check, of the beauty of Europe for those loving its cities

Instead, it insists in placing horse blinds on viewers, with a
one-trick pony zoom of Naple's inner city, its housing projects and

3673820,5,B001KWHO9W,"I spent three years living in Naples wandering the streets and alleys day and night. It has the same problems that many cities around the world has and while people wanted to rob us (never successful) they were never violent. I was in and out of Casal di Principe day and night and always felt safe. I slept there and wandered the streets there. I was alone all over that city. Never threatened. Understand that I was a blonde haired/blue eyed American kid that stuck out really badly at first. People were generally very friendly and eager to meet me and other Americans. More than once I was fed and treated like a VIP by very ordinary Italians who wanted to know more about me and America and who had just met me. More than a few times eldery Neapolitans thanked me for what the American servicemen and women did for the southern Italians in WWII. I could not take credit for this of course but I tried hard to be friendly and gracious.

I recommend that you read the book Gomorrah first. Understand through the author's words what is happening to southern Italy (and by extension to all of us) due to simple greed at the top of society and poverty at the bottom of society. Use the pictures of the movie to show yourself what the place looks like. Understand not every square inch of Southern Italy looks like a disaster zone. All people need opportunities to make an honest living and a safe and healthy place to call home. Give people these things and many of society's problems will fade. This is larger than our borders, larger than our governments and transcends language or cultural differences. Another more light hearted look at Southern Italy is ""Ciao Professore"". The movie teaches the viewer what and how some of the dysfunction of southern Italy occurs.

I'd say Gomorrah was accurate. The signs were everywhere if a person took the time to notice. One evening I interrupted a shipment of ""something"" being delivered to a beach. They had a couple of large trucks, a large bonfire, and two men dressed in dark clothes waiting for a boat that I heard attempt to land twice but my friends and I were witnesses. We were never threatened but we did some ugly looks. This was after midnight. I watched Gypsies and pickpockets practice their trades and steal from pedestrians in Naples and Rome. They attempted to rob us by distracting us with a baby while they tried to steal our wallets. We interrupted thieves robbing a neighbor's apartment. They got away with nothing but destroyed the door. We got their car but the Polizia gave it back to them. We scared away two thieves sizing up my parents oblivious to the pickpockets following them too closely. The thieves would have not gotten anything b/c the money was not in a pocket they could access. My father carried a dummy wallet. I interrupted a fellow trying to break into my Beetle trunk and chased him away. He got nothing. Our apartment was robbed one day while I worked but I lost only $150 worth of gadgets b/c I owned so little stuff there at that point. My roommate lost $1K at least.

I've daydreamed about returning to Naples for another three years to revisit the adventures I had but it would not be the same. I'd worry about the toxins that the author discussed. I lived near the edge of what Mr. Roberto Saviano described as the Triangle of Death and GoogleEarth shows one of the toxic dumps less than 3 miles from where I lived before. I went there young and ""immortal"". I'd return with a family to care for and protect. I fear living there would be an exercise in frustration where before it was a fantastic adventure. I certainly plan to visit but I know I'll never live there again.

I also recommend the ""streetview"" feature in GoogleEarth to wander some of the streets of Naples. A couple of points to note: some of the areas filmed I've seen were taken suring the mid-day summer sun and look really bleached out. Some make the downtown buildings look dirties than they are in real life.

Naples is a much maligned and overlooked gem. The tourist is safe to wander the streets and see the hidden jewels of southern Italy. Read and study the guide books. Most seem fearful of Naples. Do some research and hide your cash/passport somewhere other than your purse or pocket though like a savvy tourist. The filth and crime is mostly restricted to the poorest neighborhoods - just like in America.",1263254400,8,4377,4.57780612244898

The reviews I read suggested this was a greater showcase of the ""reality"" of the so-called mafia, and that may be true...the real mafia likely consists of uneducated thugs with little to look forward to, and absolutely no sense of the value of human life.

""Gomorrah,"" a movie about the Camorra crime organization, has received so much praise and hype that I had to give it a blind-buy.  I can't say that I found it totally exciting and coherent, but it is notable and well worth watching.

The movie features five different storylines that are intertwined, almost to the point of becoming a montage.  Each story features characters that are very genuine, with impeccable acting and writing.  Despite the movie's pacing and structure, there are a number of fascinating and insightful scenes; it is especially notable for showing the Camorra's relationship between itself and the people around it, while maintaining a gritty realistic flavor.  There is some bloody violence; it is neither overly glorified nor overly condemned, for like the movie as a whole it remains objective and unflinching.  Cameramanship is documentary-style, with lots of handheld movements, but there are never any shots that are overly chaotic.  Production design (sets, props, costumes, locations) is excellent, for it appears distinctive and genuine.  Music is interesting.

This disc has excellent quality.  The video is very sharp and clean, with excellent color and contrast.  Film grain is pretty heavy; some darker scenes may appear noisier than other scenes, but it is very good-looking for the most part.  Sound quality is decent (DTS-HD MA 5.1).  This movie is in Italian only with English subtitles.  Includes a number of extras (documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers, etc).  My copy came in a clear plastic case.",1259971200,4,1682,5.304182509505703

Being older now, I enjoy learning experiences and this is done in an almost documentary style which is right up my alley.  I love the Godfather and Goodfellas but I think Gomorrah goes to another level.  I think the acting was great/different as well.  You are almost led to believe that the actors didn't know they were being filmed.  I loved that.  I can understand why some found it boring at times.  Maybe if I was younger I wouldn't have liked it as much.  Whether you like it or not, it's one of those movies you have to see.

If you do have trouble following the movie, the extras explain everything.",1259712000,8,730,4.333333333333333
3673825,2,B001KWHO9W,"""Gormorrah"" was directed by Matteo Garrone based on the book by Roberto Saviano, which is an semi-fictional expos&eacute; of the ways in which the Camorra organized crime syndicate has brutalized the populations of Naples and Caserta. The Camorra is apparently the most murderous of Italy's criminal organizations, being responsible for an estimated 4,000 violent deaths. The film is shot in the style of a low-budget documentary, although the framing is more deliberate. The camera follows the characters around and makes sure to take in the surrounding squalor. There are 5 loosely intertwined storylines:

Thirteen-year-old Toto (Salvatore Abruzzese) takes sides in the gang war that wages in the slums; Don Ciro (Gianfelice Imparato) delivers money to the families of incarcerated mobsters but is increasingly disillusioned with his employers; two dimwitted and vainglorious aspiring gangsters, Marco (Marco Macor) and Sweet Pea (Ciro Petrone), get themselves in lots of trouble; a tailor at a business that sews couture fashions, Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo) takes money to teach Chinese garment workers at a competing firm; a crooked businessman (Toni Servillo) illegally dumps toxic waste in an abandoned quarry, as he teaches his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roberto (Carmine Paternoster) how business is done.

The idea is that the violence and fraud perpetuated by organized crime touches the lives of people from many walks of life, leaving a path of destruction from the slums up to corporate boardrooms. But ""Gommorah"" fails miserably to convince the audience of the seriousness of the problem. Instead, it promotes indifference. Marco Onorato's camera work, far from creating immediacy or ""grittiness"", is just ugly and nondescript. The characters are unsympathetic people who don't seem to care about anything or have any motive beyond the immediate and superficial. Observing them for 2 hours and 15 minutes is pure tedium. Bad things happen to innocent people, but we barely notice.

Judging by their histrionics, Garrone intends that his characters are interested in what they're doing and emotionally effected by it. But he doesn't engage the audience in anything they do or feel. The exception is Pasquale, who is a skilled and hard-working man in a difficult situation. His decision to help an ambitious Chinese competitor and the fallout of his betrayal of a mob-owned firm might make an interesting film in itself. That's the only story worth telling that I see in ""Gomorrah"". For the rest of the characters, it is difficult to imagine why they do what they do. The explanation may be that they are innately scummy and intensely stupid. Realistic perhaps, but hardly engaging. I've seen a lot of cinema verit&eacute;, and I can say without hesitation that ""Gomorrah"" is the worst example of the style that I've seen. It's totally ineffectual.

3673828,4,B001KWHO9W,"The polished portrayal and slight glorification of the workings of the criminal underworld has been dramatized in movies such as ""The Godfather"" and in the hit HBO smash ""The Sopranos"". Director Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" is a film based on the novel by Roberto Saviano that identifies events very similar to historical ones compared to the Scampia feud. This Italian crime saga attempts to dispense of the lure of glory, riches and power by presenting an undaunted look at the inner dealings of the Camorra crime organization.

The film is a collection of intertwining tales of the different people from different walks of life. The lives of a grocery delivery boy who wants to get a taste of criminal life, a tailor who has connections with the criminal underworld, two cocky teenagers who dream of becoming crime lords, two working business men who make their profit in dumping toxic waste and a man who distributes cash; all these people struggle to make ends meet all the while being influenced by the mob whether directly or indirectly. They try to make their reputation and money under the shadow of the Camorra.

Matteo Garrone's film may hold some similarities to the crime epic ""City of God"" with the manner he shoots his film. The film's look and atmosphere exude that very realistic and gritty feel that sidesteps the polished look that mainstream audiences have gotten used to over the years. The film's focused is five intertwined stories that exposes different corrupting and seductive elements that can affect the young nave mind. The film is a powerful look on the destructive effects of the corrupt, the greedy and the callous activities encouraged by this criminal network.

The film goes into the beginnings of a criminal in the personas of the two teenagers, Marco and Ciro (Marco Macor and Ciro Petrone) and Toto (Salvatore Abruzzese), the 13-year old delivery boy who gets a taste of the lifestyle; while one ending abruptly and the other showing its advancements. The tailor, Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo) and the cash dealer, Don Ciro (Gianfelice Imparato) are timid individuals who many may say that they are `stuck' with their situation. Roberto (Carmine Paternoster) is young man who works for Franco (Tony Servillo) who dumps illegal waste on unused patches of land for the sake of making huge amounts of profit. Garrone brings his observational perspective in his fragmented style filmmaking that just brings his viewers into the world of the mob in the beginning, the present and the future of its many dealings. It is a bleak and unflinching vision as to what the Camorra has done to Italy that threatens to wring every cent off its citizens.

The film's dialogue is accompanied by the use of incredible close-ups to bring the film's emotions right into the face of the viewer. I thought this was a very clever move for Garrone to bring us into the depths of conversations that gives the viewer a feeling of `being there'. The film starts off on a high note with a mob hit then it takes a slower pace as we see Marco and Ciro imitating ""Scarface"", Don Ciro going about his daily routine and so forth. The film is a little bit of a slow burn, the energy slowly exudes from its slow build up and lets the scenes come about naturally. ""Gomorrah"" is very realistic so expect no polished use of colors, style and elaborate visual manipulation, the film is as straight-forward as it can be with its portrayal. The film has a fair share of violence and the more I thought about it, it may not be as disturbing as to how the violence is all connected under one strong inevitable force of nature.

The performances in the film are very good. Marco Macor and Ciro Petrone almost takes the show as they represent the raw stupidity fueled by sheer cockiness that turns them into outcasts of society. They are power hungry (they want to be Tony Montana) and mad for blood, as they wish to make their reputation. Toto (played by Abruzzese) gets a taste of mob life through his own set of rules, not by making waves but through obedience and respect; the young actor manages to bring forth a likeable yet so disturbing personality in the film's script. The recent under-grad , Roberto (played by Paternoster) represents something unnerving as even sensible, level-headed individuals can be dragged into illegal activities when the situation presents itself. Much as the film goes into the other dealings of the Camorra, I thought the manner with which Garrone brings the `youthful' perspective into play is the film's main strength; the young people are after all, any nation's future.

""Gomorrah"" sidesteps any glamorization of the criminal underworld and unrelentingly paints a very real `truth'. The film is a powerful anti-mob movie, and while it does take some inspiration from glamorous Hollywood mob films such as ""Scarface"" and ""Good Fellas"", it educates us with its raw unflinching message. It doesn't give us a reason to see `crime' as something necessary or a lifestyle, but provokes a thought and a reaction with the bleakness of its premise. It paints a painful reality that when Garrone closes his film, I was awed with the fact that these intertwined stories were touched upon by truth. The film is a gut-wrenching crime drama that packs a lot of visceral punch. Garrone makes it even more powerful with its realistic natural-looking visuals that almost looks like a documentary. Compelling, haunting and brutally realistic, Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" nicely blends brutal violence, melodrama and art house sensibilities that it earns a highly recommended rating from me.

Highly Recommended! [4+ Stars]

Criterion boasts of a very nice if grainy 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen that was shot intentionally to look a little dirty to capture a realistic feel. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Italian track is very powerful as it captures the gunfire and the noises of water very nicely. Subtitles are excellent.",1259020800,8,5936,4.934934934934935
3673829,4,B001KWHO9W,"...or better yet not.  This film is real but depressing.  I agree with some of the criticsm here that the stories within this film are a little disjointed when you first see this.  And if you know nothing about the problems with organized crime in and around Naples then some of this may not make complete sense.  But for the most part this film does not romanticize the mafia like so many American films do.  And for that alone this is an interesting film to see.

I waited a long time to see this.  It took quite a while to be released on dvd in the US and in the US format.  The bottom line is that this is raw and sometimes hard to watch because of the random, heartless and very real violence...  but it is something that you will probably want to see again because the performances are very unaffected for the most part and after seeing that horrific real Naples hit on Youtube this seems very realistic.

This does for Naples tourism what City of Lost Children did for Rio.",1259020800,3,980,4.306010928961749
3673830,4,B001KWHO9W,"I read Roberto Saviano's nonfiction expose on the Cammora crime syndicate and the Naples crime scene in general. Hearing about that a movie was being adapted I was interested to see how the film would take a very dense nonfiction work and turn it into film. Hence Gomorrah released by IFC- which thankfully started VOD distribution which is how I saw the film. The film as it is, is an unflinching portrayl of crime, like Gillo Pontecorvo's seminal Battle of Algiers or City of God shot on location, mixing actors and non-actors ( or in the case of some actors actual Camorra associates). It is not romantic or action packed. It is however good at mixing the facts of Saviano's book into largely fictionalized plotlines as it follows five stories from Don Ciro, a bagman who delivers money to family members of jailed criminals, to Franco a ruthless businessman who does whatever it takes to aquire land for companies to dump toxic waste. Outside of those theres Pasquale working at crafting counterfit clothes, one of the biggest jobs near the port of Naples. And then theres the story of youths Toto who's been initiated into a gang and Marco and Ciro, two wannabe gangsters who wave guns around angering actual gangsters. The story of the two kids was one of the more lasting stories of Saviano's book and smartly ends the film.
Like I said the major accomplisment of the movie is taking the facts of the book and portraying them onto film. The movie as it is isn't for those weened on Scarface or The Wire. Its more an uncompromising, realistic, depiction of crime and the effect it has on people. The actors are naturalistic and good with the standout being Toni Servilo as Franco. Mostly though the filmmakers and writers are the reason the movie works making an unromanticized crime film. They obviously wanted to respect Saviano's sacrifice and they've done so. If theres one thing to say against it most might not like the films tone. In its attempt to be as realistic as possible respecting their subject, not a whole lot happens in the film action wise which is why it has been called boring by some. The characters in my opinion and their journey from begining to end were interesting but thats me. Others might not like the film for that fact, something stressed by the films need for realism. Outside of that the film, and Saviano's book are an interesting combination in my opinon.
The film might not be for everyone but for those who want an unflinching view of crime this is the film to see, one that will be marked as a classic in the future in my opinion. I'm glad Criterion picked up the film for home release even though I have not seen the finished product. With them releasing it for home markets I'm sure the DVD will have a great mix of features that wouldn't be put on other releases. Can't wait to see it.
Now that I've seen the disc I have to say the picture is absolutely fantastic. I've never had a bad experience and Criterions release of this recent film is absolutely amazing in terms of audio/visual quality making me wonder how it would look on Blu-Ray in comparision. The extras are pretty good with a load of interviews. Interviews with Matteo Garrone and Toni Servillo are lengthy dialogues recorded especially for Criterion. Most of the other materials were ported from other editions of the movie. Theres an hour long making of documentary, deleted scenes, interviews with Servillo and several other actors and best of all a nearly hour long interview with Author Roberto Saviano who imparts a lot of information from his book. While the movie covered topics Saviano seeks to cover a lot of facts and for anyone who hasn't read his book its an interesting segment. If you're a fan of the movie Criterion definitely delivered the version to own whether it be in Standard or Blu.",1255478400,17,3817,4.664688427299703
3673831,5,B001KWHO9W,"Gomorrah was one of the old testament cities judged and laid waste by God on the grounds of it's sin and corruption.

Scampia is a district in contemporary Naples.

At first glance, the council estate in Scampia on which the majority of Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" takes place appears to be your usual raffish, rough-around-the-edges melting pot of low income families, wannabes, try-hards and dreamers: there's Toto, who works as a delivery boy for his mother's grocery store; Pasquale, who works as the lead tailor in a factory which creates high-end fashion designs; Roberto who, after years of unemployment has just managed to land a prestigious job with a councilor, Franco, and is in the process of learning the ropes; Ciro, who, at first glance, appears to be a kindly, middle-aged building manager who looks after the welfare of families on the estate; then there are Marco and Ciro, two bored teenagers who spend their days imitating Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" and getting into trouble. However, before the final percussive strains of the film's minimalist soundtrack play out over some devastatingly well-placed captions which detail the current reach of contemporary organised crime, the comparisons between the corrupt old testament city-state and the contemporary housing estate will have been made explicit in the most visceral way possible and the viewer will observe just how corruption and criminality insinuates its way into virtually every level of Neapolitan society (as well as every one of the previously mentioned characters' lives).

The lexicon of modern cinema has inculcated contemporary audiences with a fascination of all things Mafiosi (or ""Camorra"" as the Neapolitan organisation is known). Cinematic short-hand has bombarded us with a fictionalized, glamourous world of sleek suits, pearl-handled revolvers and witty profanity. ""Gomorrah"", although a work of fiction, is not concerned with screen artifice or the rewards reaped by crime; it is explicitly concerned with those who have to live under the yoke and suffer the consequences of organised crime's insinuation into every level of private and public life.

If you want to see what a world ruled by Tony Soprano or Vito Corleone would really look like, then look no further. But believe me, its not pretty. And there is very little in the way of ""honour"" to be seen here.

Garrone eschews the grandiose operatic flourishes of a Scorsese or a Coppola and instead favours a laconic, naturalistic tone which resembles the Neo-Realism of Rossellini's,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-City/dp/6305075573/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open City</a>. Many of the film's scenes have an almost improvised quality to them which only compounds the frighteningly realistic nature of the film. Garrone doesn't spoon-feed the plot or the relationships between the characters to you and, depending on how eagle-eyed you are, it may take you a fair deal of time to ascertain just 'what is what' and 'who is who to whom'. Make no bones about it - this is not a film to be watched whilst surfing the internet on your mobile phone; this is a film to which you must pay full attention.

An epic in every sense of the world and probably the best big-screen feature ever made about the Mafia/Camorra, I recommend it unreservedly.

It makes an ideal companion piece to Roberto Saviano's expose of the Neapolitan crime syndicates, which I haven't read, but which apparently provided the film's inspiration, as well as the more conventionally told, but similarly brilliant tale of the Milanese Mafia,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romanzo-criminale-Crime-Novel-Original-Italian-Version-with-English-Subtitles/dp/B00149IN0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romanzo criminale / Crime Novel (Original Italian Version - with English Subtitles)</a>, and Ricky Tognazzi's chilling examination of a group of ""sitting-duck"" Police Bodyguards,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Scorta/dp/B000CR8QV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Scorta</a>.",1254700800,54,4120,5.891122278056951

3673833,2,B001KWHO9W,"It's so incoherent that makes it very difficult to follow and enjoy. It tells different stories of different people and they do not intersect with each other.

The only good thing about this movie is it terrifyingly exposes the brutality and the effect the Camorra crime syndicate has on everybody. They kill anybody including children. They sell drugs and collect taxes from all business such as waste disposal, etc. They recruit children to work as lookouts for their drug business. They corrupt people with money and death threat. The list go on and on.

The book is more gripping and terrifying.",1251676800,8,599,4.920792079207921
3673834,4,B001KWHO9W,"Think of this movie as an Neapolitan version of ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" but without the charm, happiness or stubborn sense of hope. The movie's 5 interweaving stories are sometimes hard to follow, but they involve down-and-out city dwellers trying to live an a world infested by Camorra gangs, drugs, murder, sectarian infighting and unrelieved violence. The inhabitants live in a bombed-out cement building - -a parking-garage-like edifice built to withstand explosions, but bereft of any charm. The film has wonderful original characters and some stunning imaginary. While thugs chase a fugitive on one level of concrete walkways, a wedding procession takes place on a walkway below them.  The title is a play on the name of the Camorra gang, hinting broadly at the relationship with Gomorrah, biblical Sodom's evil-twin sister city, a place so full of vice and lawlessness that only complete destruction was sufficient to deal with it.

Masterfully shot, splendidly written and well acted, ""Gomorra"" is not a film to watch when you're trying to pull out of a tough week at work.",1250812800,33,1080,5.2011494252873565

3673838,4,B001KWHO9W,"... because this is a story that needs to be told, but it is very hard to watch.  Hard, because the director, actors, set designers have created a grim reality.  There is no relief from the violence and sleeze.

Like the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gomorrah-A-Personal-Journey-into-the-Violent-International-Empire-of-Naples-Organized-Crime-System/dp/0312427794/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gomorrah: A Personal Journey into the Violent International Empire of Naples' Organized Crime System</a>, the movie is a series of tenuously connected vignettes. I wonder if I could have followed movie if I hadn't read the book.

The book has a few pages of relief, for instance a jaunt to Aberdeen, the author's reconnection with his father and something of the brave men and women in law enforcement. The movie has no relief from the grim neighborhoods and the cruel people. There is nothing that compares to the glamour that Hollywood ascibes to the American gangster.  You won't see any good looking people, wealthy dons or lush estates.

3673839,5,B001KWHO9W,"Italian movie that comes out in the States in 2009. It reminds me of 'Traffic', the way that it tells the story of a scourge that infiltrates society at all levels. In 'Traffic', it was drugs. In 'Gomorrah', the problem is the mafia, and it's control over the slums of Naples. It shows corruption at all levels - governmental, business, and even how the youth get corrupted at such a young age. There are several overlapping storylines, and while it can be a little difficult to follow at times, it's worth the effort.
