8197867,4,B000QWA5WA,"I was able to find another copy of a classic NWA event with this one being The Great American Bash 1988. For those hardcore fans, this was the first ever Great American Bash that was broadcasted on PPV since previously, The Bash was a tour of shows that would eventually have the event released with some highlighted matches. Also if you can remember, back in these days, the old NWA PPV tapes were edited down to two hours but since I have the original PPV broadcast, I am not sure what is edited although I have heard that the first two matches have been edited down a few minutes.

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs Sting & Nikita Koloff. This was solid tag team wrestling at its best as Arn & Tully were one of the best tag teams of all time & you saw elements of that as they tried to cut the ring in half while controlling one member of the other team. Sting & Nikita held their own & even meshed well as a team as this was hard fought battle to the very end of the 20 minute time limit.

NWA United States Tag Team Champions The Fantastics vs The Midnight Express. Due to what happened at the previous Clash Of The Champions, Jim Cornette would be wearing a straight jacket & be suspended high above the ring in a cage to prevent interference. These two teams never fail to deliver the goods when it comes to tag team action & this match was no different as this was better than their Clash match as it was just solid tag team action right from the opening bell before The Express were still able to find a way to win without Cornette.

""Tower Of Doom"" Triple Cage Match: Road Warriors, Dr. Death Steve Williams, Jimmy & Ron Garvin vs Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, Ivan Koloff, Al Perez & Russian Assassin. If you remember the DDP/Jarrett feud from 2000 or even the ""Ready To Rumble"" feud, this was the same cage structure that they used then. The object of this match was that one member of each team would enter the top of the cage & after every two minutes, another person enters the top cage with both teams alternating members. The rules to win is to escape through all three cages with all of your team members. This was really something to see for it's time as it was just a wild brawl with it being an impressive sight alone seeing these men battle from that height. However, the bigger story here was the confrontation between Jimmy Garvin & Kevin Sullivan over Jim's wife Precious that even played a factor in the end & in the aftermath of the match.

NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs Dusty Rhodes. This was based off Windham joining the Horsemen not to long before this event so Dusty was out for revenge. This was the type of match that really picked up from the opening bell & went back & forth between these two before it started to slow down near the end (mostly when Windham had the claw hold for almost five minutes straight) until Ron Garvin made his way to the ring to do what nobody, including Dusty, expected him to do.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs Lex Luger. Their first match in their series of matches which was based off Luger turning face & leaving the Horsemen. Flair was in the prime of his career & Luger was definitely at his best at this time so this was solid main event as Luger relied on his power offense while Flair worked on Luger's knee & used Luger's momentum at times to gain an advantage. There were a few botches (clothesline over the top rope, Luger almost botching a press slam) but the match was still solid. The only real negative part of this match was it's conclusion as the old term ""Dusty finish"" was used as it appeared that Luger had won the title only for the match to be halted due to blood loss by the Maryland Commission.

In the end, this was a very solid wrestling show from start to finish just as you would expect from the NWA with the only real negative thing that I can say here about it would be the booking of the ending for the main event. Past that, this is quality NWA card that should satisfy any wrestling fan.",1307059200,,4018,4.31523178807947
8197868,4,B000QWA5WA,"I recently saw this PPV on WWE 24/7 and it was actually a very solid wrestling card put on by the NWA at the time.  Usually at this time, the matches were edited down (or completely taken out) so the tape would run around 2 hours but since I saw the replay of the PPV & not the tape version, I don't know what's been edited.

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Nikita Koloff - They went to the 20 min. draw here but it was a solid match here from beginning to end.  You saw the traits of what made Arn & Tully one of the greatest tag teams as they cut the ring in half & always kept their opponetts in control while Sting & Nikita held their own here as well.
(Also available on the ""Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen"" DVD)

NWA United States Tag Team Champions The Fantastics vs. Midnight Express - The stipulation was that Jim Cornette would be suspended above the ring (and if I remember right, he had a straight jacket on as well).  This was another solid tag team match here as both teams were young & the match had a faster pace than the opener.  With the Midnight Express being one of the original high flyin' tag teams of it's time along with the Fantastics being an underrated team, it was the ""sleeper"" match of the night with Cornette crying & acting scared thoughout the match just adds a bit of humor.

""Tower Of Doom"" Triple Cage Match: Road Warriors, Steve Williams, Jimmy & Ron Garvin vs. Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, Al Perez, Ivan Koloff, Russian Assassain - This structure is similar to the ""Ready To Rumble"" cage that WCW had around 2000.  The storyline regarding this match was that Kevin Sullivan wanted Precious, Jimmy Garvin's wife.  The way the match worked is that one member of each team enters the top cage & every two mins., another member of each team enters at the top cage.  While that's happening, the trap doors in each cage will open and the object is to get all of your team members though each of the 3 cages out the door at the bottom in which Precious herself holds the keys to.  This was your typical multiman brawl for around 20 mins. as it really got interesting in the end with Sullivan & Jimmy Garvin remaining and Sullivan trying to get at Precious.

NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Dusty Rhodes - This wasn't a classic match but it was an enjoyable match for most of the match for the first 10 mins. until the ending when Barry Windham put the claw on Dusty & held it on for at least the last five minutes until the referee got knocked out & Ron Garvin came out to cost Dusty the match in the end.  It was an enjoyable match between the two until the end.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - Eventhough Luger has a reputation for nothing being as great in the ring as he should be for the position he was pushed in, he pulled his own weight here in one of his best matches in his series with Flair.  Eventhough some of the moves were obiviously botched (closeline over the top rope with both wrestlers taking at least a minute to go over to the floor), it was a solid match up with Flair doing what he does best in the ring while Luger displayed alot of power moves.  The ending was a jip with the match being stopped right before Luger won the title but if you knew how the NWA would book their title matches, it was almost expected.

Overall, this was a solid event from top to bottom eventhough there are better events from this era of the NWA that are worth the high price set for this rare tape.  I recommend this.",1183939200,,3510,4.252631578947368
