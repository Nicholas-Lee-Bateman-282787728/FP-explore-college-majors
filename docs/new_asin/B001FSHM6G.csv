8302552,5,B001FSHM6G,"Well, it may not be the best quality recording, but the information is fantastic, and it helped me get over some terrible pain that I have lived with for years!",1359158400,,160,4.366666666666666
8302553,1,B001FSHM6G,"It looks like the person in the DVD took his little home camera and recorded himself. I can't believe someone would charge money for this. You'd think someone based in Los Angeles could find a professional to shoot and edit the video. But considering that the information in it is worthless, I guess you don't get what you pay for, twice. Not recommended at all. Also, his guru/teacher/certifier just won the 2010 Scammy Awards...",1270598400,11,430,4.824324324324325
8302554,3,B001FSHM6G,"The video starts with a lecture by Brent Phillips sitting at a table.  The background appears to be a white wall with one picture.  The sound has a slight hollow tone. Then he stands up and continues his lecture against a white wall and is joined by a female who demonstrates the muscle testing techniques as he continues to lecture.  Then he sits back down at the table with white background and continues to lecture until the end of the video.  The DVD does not have a menu with individual tracks for easy review of the techniques.  You have to ""rewind"".  Personally, I have seen better muscle testing technique videos on youtube. On the plus side, I feel he gives a very clear description of why muscle testing works.",1259452800,18,720,4.542635658914729
