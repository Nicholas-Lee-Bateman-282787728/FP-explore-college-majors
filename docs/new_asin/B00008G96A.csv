1847866,2,B00008G96A,"To be honest, I never purchased this product, I rented it from Blockbuster once.  My friends and I were trying to find the dumbest horror movie we could find, AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL.  You will NEVER, EVER see a worse movie than Monsturd.  With the main character named ""Jack Schmitt"", you can't really expect an Academy Award.  This movie looks like a very low-budget student film.  The plot is awful, the actors are terrible, and the music is turgid, to say the least.  The only redeeming quality about this movie (and I use that term loosely) is its comic value.  My friends and I got exactly what we wanted: a terrible horror film.  We were rolling on the floor laughing at several points in the movie, either because of plot discrepancies or just good old fashioned ridiculousness.  I wouldn't spend any money on this movie, but I would recommend renting it and showing it to anyone who will laugh at something so stupid.  But if you think you're going to walk away with a well-crafted scary movie, you'll be extremely disappointed.",1067731200,4,1036,4.6740331491712706

1847869,1,B00008G96A,"Monsturd (Rick Popko and Don West, 2003)

I'll put it to you this way: what was the last horror spoof that was actually funny? I can actually answer this question, though I am terrified to watch the movie again (I haven't seen it in decades) to find out how badly it holds up: 1981's Student Bodies. Yes, I'm asserting that it's been more than three decades since someone made a horror spoof that was actually amusing. (I have recently watched two other favorites from that era, 1982's Pandemonium and 1981's Saturday the 14th, and found both had aged... very, very badly. I WILL NOT DEFAME THE MEMORY OF THE HORSEHEAD BOOKENDS.) Now I grant you, these days the horror-spoof standard is measured by the pieces of celluloid defecated out by Team Wayans, who last did anything funny in the In Living Color days, and when you're comparing Monsturd to, for example, Scary Movie 4 or Meet the Spartans, it's hard for even... [I will note here for the record I am attempting to avoid every fecal-matter-based pun I desperately want to put into this review] ...like this to not come up smelling like water-treatment-plant-processed roses. The problem is, you always still have the ghost of that fertilizer smell. While this is leagues above most of the horror spoofs of the past decade, it still stinks.

Plot: Jack Schmidt (ha! get it?) (Brad Dosland, whose only other screen appearance came in Popko and West's even more revolting follow-up, 2008's Retardead) is a serial killer on the run from the law. He hides in a toxic-waste-infested sewer, where his genes get inextricably linked to, well, the other things one normally finds in a sewer. Just in case you didn't think being a serial killer made him enough of a [censored for Amazon consumption]... (okay, that one I couldn't resist).

Juvenile toilet-humor jokes, atrocious acting, inept technical aspects (up to and including direction), and a brain-dead script only take one so far. It is absolutely possible to write a good horror-comedy these days, and even a politically-incorrect one; the hilariously profane Special Dead, from 2006, is all the evidence anyone should need that such is the case. But most of the people who are trying to mine this vein over the past few decades just aren't trying. The American comedy has in the main degenerated into a quest for the quick buck, with no thought given to whether the director is making something timeless--or even something that will be remembered a decade later. The collected works of Chris Farley, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, etc. are testament to that. And it's hard to blame Popko and West for playing in the same court if it actually works vis-a-vis making said quick buck, but don't you wish every once in a while someone  in this country would at least attempt to make another Bringing Up Baby or Sullivan's Travels or The Apartment? Monsturd ain't it. *",1363564800,,2866,4.830957230142566

1847873,3,B00008G96A,"A daughter tells her father a bedtime story involving an escaped convict who is transformed into a mutant poop monster after being exposed to an experimental chemical. The ensuing rampage through Butte County leaves everyone too terrified to use the toilet as the police struggle to purge the city of the evil menace! Though the title, cover art, and premise speak otherwise, MONSTURD is every bit the B-movie gold that fans would hope for. Its epic score perfectly contrasts the ridiculousness of the plot as well as its scatological humor. Each of the gags earn the laughs they deserve, mixing only the worst toilet humor with many clever puns. The intentionally terrible acting and filming only add to the low-budget charm, recreating the high level of camp found in drive-in classics like THE CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA or THE BLOB. It holds nothing back in the gore and gross-out department, splattering the screen with all of the depravity and diarrhetic hose jobs that would be expected from a film bearing its name. Rick Popko and Dan West understand the elements needed in order to make a successful B-movie, turning MONSTURD into a raunchy good time that is sure to become a cult favorite.

1847874,1,B00008G96A,"I cannot resist a bad horror film. I saw this movie and thought it would be worth a laugh but I was wrong. The film is slow, offers no gore, and the monster looked like it was made out of Vienna sausages. If Troma made this movie it would have been 100% better but it's not. Avoid this movie it's not worth your time even if you like stupid horror films.",1267401600,,354,4.0
1847875,4,B00008G96A,"This is one of the most amazing movies that I have ever seen. It would take a truly unique and twisted mind to conceive of a poo-monster that terrorizes a small town. What is truly amazing is that the movie, despite its miniscule budget, outlandish lowbrow concept, and the fact it was shot on video, is actually a moderately entertaining horror spoof that takes plenty of shots at extremely famous horror movies. I especially love the spoof of ""Jaws"" when the Sheriff pleads with city officials not to close the beach, but rather to cancel the annual chili cook-off, which is in a park very near the storm sewer where the giant walking, talking poo resides.

Every horror movie stereotype is skewered here, and despite the obvious economy of production, the film is entertaining and funny. Even the box gets into the act when it proclaims ""It's not just a movie, it's a movement!"" Sure the humor is juvenile, but as a parody it is effective and entertaining. At the very least, you have certainly never seen anything like it.

The DVD has several extras including a commentary track featuring cast and crew, as well as a ""Making of Monsturd"" documentary that is almost as entertaining as the movie itself. I would like to single out the musical score for praise and in particular the lyrics to the closing song (titled ""Number Two"") for pure surreal entertainment value.

This is a film like no other. If you like Grade-B oddball films, you can't go wrong with ""Monsturd"". Just don't forget to bring the Pepto-Bismol.",1264291200,8,1518,4.742424242424242

When Jack Schmidt falls into a pit of radioactive chemicals that causes him to turn into a feces monster,the fun begins.  He is living in the sewer and traveling through the pipes to attack people while they are on the can. The police try to warn the townspeople, but they want to have their annual chili cook-off anyway!

1847878,3,B00008G96A,"Think you've seen it all?  You don't know Jack Schmitt!

For those of you creepy disturbed perverts who had a brainfart and thought this piece of crap was a good idea, I'll serve it up for you.

This is MONSTURD, and yes it's about a creature made of poop.  An escaped convict (asstutely named Jack Schmitt) dies a mysterious death in the city sewer.
Of course there just happened to be some shady experiments going on at the nearby genetics research lab, and an ill-fated mishap contaminates the sewage system.  And yep,(poop)is gonna hit the fan.

I know what you're thinking--a big walking, talking pile of nasty excrement sounds like some yummy entertainment.  Now, this movie does drop a nice cheesy stinkbomb in your face.  But in some regards, MONSTURD just passes gas.

This is mainly due to the lengthy attempts at plot and character development.  We don't need 45 minutes of anticipation and attempts at building tension.  Especially with this bad acting and poopy dialogue.  Just quickly shower us with filth & depravity!  Plus a turd rape scene would have been a welcome treat.
I did love the bumbling cops ductaping themselves with diapers(body armor) and filling their Super-Soakers with Pepto-Bismol.  Plus, how often do you get the chance to see a giant turdmonster?  Good sick times!

Overall, this is moderately recommended for adults with crappy-awesome tastes in film.  You might wanna drop the kids off first though.",1245974400,27,1437,4.945606694560669
1847879,5,B00008G96A,"If you like gross-out, sophmoric humor and jokes about bodily functions, this movie's for you. About the only thing funnier than the movie itself is the director's commentary, which makes you appreciate this low-budget gem all the more.

Basically, two guys had a video camera and a few thousand dollars. Considering what they had to work with (their friends and relatives played most of the roles), they did a great job. Being of a sick mind, I've always wished somebody would make a movie about poop- because poop is funny- and here it is. The poop jokes and effects are hilarious- watch out for diapers, corn and peanuts (get it?), suppositories, toilet paper, etc.

The plot is relatively simple and nothing you haven't seen before. Basically, a serial killer escapes from prison and enters the sewer, where he encounters a batch of nuclear waste and turns into- you guessed it- a giant man-eating turd. Said turd then goes on a rampage in the town, making it unsafe to use the toilet. In an action-packed climax, the turd is stopped (I won't spoil it by telling you how) by the diaper-clad heroes (sheriff, FBI agent, etc.) This is not Oscar material by any means, but it's great for some laughs.",1199232000,,1201,4.741626794258373

1847881,3,B00008G96A,"With so many silly ideas floating around in direct to video horror films anymore, I guess we all knew in the back of our minds that it would only be a matter of time before they got around to this concept.  The idea of a poopman might not be 100% original(after all Kevin Smith had his poop demon in Dogma, and Green Jelly had their poopman superhero on their Cereal Killer album.  I remember they even sold toy figures of those!), this would definitely be the first full length feature about a killer turd man.  The idea is priceless and had huge comic potential, but it just comes up very short.  The film is shot with a digital camera, so while it may be crystal clear picture, it just doesn't look like a movie in the traditional sense.  It has a home movie/public access look about it, and I just can never get by that.  Film is film and it will always be what movies are shot with if you ask me.  Each and every toilet/poop pun is used, no matter how good or awful.  They even manage to make up a bunch of new ones.  The film certainly has it's funny moments, but they are few and far between, and considering the potential for laughs, that's a disappointment.  Monsturd is obviously only gonna appeal to a certain group of movie fans.  The average person will see this on the video store shelf, shake their head, maybe point it out to their buddy, and then move down to grab a copy of Monster In Law.  It is difficult to recommend this one even to a Troma or Full Moon fan(well, maybe Full Moon, that stuff is rather putrid).  There are definitely worse things out there of course(when watching a bad film you can always comfort yourself that at least you're not watching Napoleon Dynamite), and like I mentioned before there are a few genuine laughs, so not all is lost on Monsturd.  I just wish this concept would have been brought to the screen by someone different.",1149120000,,1876,4.368876080691643
1847882,3,B00008G96A,"With a name like Monsturd, it's gotta be bad. And it is.

But it's not bad in a Gigli way-- here... lemme give you an example: Watching Monsturd is like watching a really bad wreck; you are disturbed to no end, yet it's hard to look away. Watching Gigli is like being in a wreck. Any questions?

No, Monsturd is at least enjoyable. It's downright silly, but still pretty funny. It had a lot of potential to be TOTALLY tasteless, but they really fumbled the ball on this one. If some college or high school kids had made a movie about a poop monster you can be darn sure it'd make even the dead laugh. I really wish that this had been a Troma film, because even Troma films have a better budget than this one did... It was all filmed on digital film, and I don't think they knew how to use any filters to improve the quality. I know, I know... a movie about giant, walking, homocidal turd doesn't exactly demand the high quality treatment... but every little bit counts.

There were some golden nuggets in this mountain of poo, however. I think as the actors were encouraged to ad lib more and more, the lines became steadily more funny. The speech that the cop gives on the bullhorn made me laugh so hard I was hurting. The scene with the two cops vomiting after finding the first victim was priceless... nothing is as funny as people puking. Nothing. I really like the taunts that the Poopman leaves on the bathroom walls too. ""Don't get caught with your pants down!"" amongst others. The acting was just... HORRIBLE. In a movie like this it's actually a high point of the experience. It's obvious this was the first movie these guys ever made... and it's evident from many angles.

I'd have to say that the best feature of the whole thing is outtakes reel, that is more like a documentary about the making of the movie. It shows how much these guys didn't know about movie making, how they were really wussies (there's a scene where the guy in the Monsturd costume is practically crying and whining to be let out of the suit), and how immature they were (two of the guys get really hacked off with each other during the shooting of one scene). Fun stuff! And it even gave me an idea for something I want to make now.

So go in knowing full-well you are watching a movie about an 8-foot-tall poop monster and don't expect a masterpiece.  Just think like a rude kid and have fun!",1147046400,,2378,4.380952380952381

You'd think with a name like ""Monsturd"" there'd be some hilarious disgusting scenes, like the vomit scene in Bad Taste. All the poo jokes were so obvious though. Any idiot could come up with this bland ultra-tame/G-rated dialogue. They also have awful film music being abused in every scene. Give it a rest, geesh. There aren't any violent/gore parts either. When the lame monster attacks, they just show people screaming and water splashing with some tootsie roll stains apparently. The monster only gets shown a couple times too.

The worst part of the movie is that it takes elements of the thriller genre (which it tries to spoof as well as horror) too seriously. There were details they just spent too much time on explaining. I wanted to watch a movie, not follow something pointless. I can't believe I sat through this mess. The ending felt like they just ran out of ideas so they just ended everything in a snap.
