269621,4,6300246795,"Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard butt heads with each other while taking on the Nazis in this satisfying World War II film.  The first part of ""Von Ryan's Express"" takes place in an Italian Prisoner of War camp in 1943, when the Allies had invaded Southern Italy and Germany was trying to keep Italy in the war.  When Colonel Ryan (Sinatra) arrives at the camp he is the senior officer, although he is just a pilot and Major Fincham (Howard) is a career officer.  Ryan wants to just wait for the Allies to liberate the camp, while Fincham wants to escape.  When Ryan trades the prisoner's escape route for medical supplies, the English prisoners add the ""von"" to his name.  When the Italians abandon the camp, the prisoners escape into the country side only to be captured by the Nazis.  They then capture a German train and make a daring and exciting run for the Swiss border and freedom, believing that if only one of them escapes, it is a victory.
Not as compelling as ""The Great Escape,"" this is still a very entertaining film.  The scene where Ryan forces the Italian commandant (Adolfo Celi) to provide new clothing because the prisoners have all stripped and thrown their rags into a fire is certainly memorable, as is the moment when Ryan guns down the young woman (Raffaella Carra) who has sold them out to the Germans.  Sergio Fantoni as the sympathetic Italian Captain Oriani and Edward Mulhare as the German-speaking Chaplain Costanzo have solid supporting roles.  Half the movie is taken up by the train chase, which goes through cities being bomb and along treacherous mountain tracks, but the heated exchanges between Ryan and Fincham are at the heart of this film.  Sinatra is remarkably comfortable with this role, which is ultimately what makes ""Von Ryan's Express"" work as much as the train chase.",994204800,12,1815,4.751592356687898
269622,5,6300246795,"This is by FAR my favorite Frank Sinatra movie and my SECOND favorite WWII movie ever!  (Second in a VERY close contest with Where Eagles Dare.)  The plot is just FASCINATING - BASED on a true story (if I remember correctly - sorry if I'm wrong on this).  There were SO many spots in this movie where I was literally on the edge of my seat or biting my nails.  Frank does a fantastic job!  He's SUCH a superb actor!  My ONLY 'beef' with this movie is how it ends (although still a overall happy ending, it has a sad turn that I won't spoil for you).  If not for the ending, this would be my favorite war movie ever!  Still a CLOSE second and a movie that I can watch OVER and OVER again!",989280000,6,687,4.037037037037037

269625,5,6300246795,"One often forgets that Frank Sinatra, besides being one of the last century's (Yeah, it is!) vocal talents, was one heckuva an actor.  ""Von Ryan's Express"" is a great World War II yarn with a  ""Great Escape""-type storyline and vivid performances from the  main stars and the supporting players.  Of course, the Nazi villains are  rather stereotypically rotten, but that just adds to the ""fun"" as  Sinatra and company outwit them.  The end scene still brings a tear to this  reviewer's eyes.",967680000,3,490,4.890243902439025

269627,5,6300246795,"This film gets my vote for the best WWII movie ever!  It's got Trevor Howard as the penultimate crazy British colonel, and our man Frank as the no nonsense American Flying ace.  The characters bring out interesting  facts about the Italian Cooperation with the Germans (very half-hearted)  during wwII and the sense of frustration and uncertainty during the closing  days of the war on the part of all the countries involved.  This film  represents the sense of honor and integrity that were common among  soldiers, at that time, and how human beings can have odd interpratations  of these noble character traits.",943401600,8,613,4.99009900990099

269710,1,6300246795,"Review for Von Ryan's Express
Hot Toasty Rag, September 15, 2017

Frank Sinatra is captured and placed in a Prisoner of War camp in WW2 Italy. While there are the classic scenes of soldiers standing up to the guards and being punished, the heart of the movie is about the mens escape attempts, led by Sinatra and Trevor Howard.

I know this is a very famous war movie, but I didn't happen to like it. I found most of the schemes pretty unrealistic, and only a fraction of them suspenseful. There wasn't anything really wrong with the acting or the pace of the film, but I found my attention wandering more often than not. Then again, I fell asleep during The Bridge on the River Kwai, so maybe Im just not riveted by POW movies. If you liked the 1957 Alec Guinness classic, give Von Ryan's Express a try and see if you find it as exciting. Then you can lecture me on true cinema appreciation!",1505433600,,892,4.367469879518072

But when Italy surrenders and he and the other prisoners are put on a train headed for Germany, he develops a plan that, if successful, could get all of the men to Switzerland. No, it's not as quite as nuanced or well-written as the classic film, The Great Escape. But if you enjoyed that movie, I think you will like this one too.",1461110400,,658,4.446280991735537

270466,4,6300246795,"This was one of the few films I've seen by Sinatra where he DIDN'T sing or dance. It was weird. Almost didn't recognize him.

The movie was rather interesting: American POW comes into Italian POW camp where mostly Brits reside. As the highest ranking officer, he takes over command of US and UK POWs among themselves, settling their disputes and getting everyone what is best for them (not necessarily what they think they want :) ). Daring escape and many heart-pumping close calls along the way.

In this case, it was to lead a ragtag bunch of soldiers held captive by the Germans in an Italian prisoner of war camp. Conditions there were bad enough, but the boxcar journey to Germany was worse. I was in awe of the physical requirements of what those soldiers had to endure and devastated by the ending, but will probably watch it again.",1456012800,,531,4.373737373737374

(And if you haven't watched the trailer, good, don't read any more of this review; it would defeat my purpose of trying to preserve the suspense.) Why was it necessary to show the climactic ending of the film in the trailer? There were enough suspenseful scenes to pique a potential viewer's interest; any of those could have been chosen. I mean, people go to see Titanic and they know a tragedy is in the works, still, there's suspense; they don't give you a trailer with Jack drowning. The jacket cover shows enough: Ryan running, reaching out to grab the train. Will he make it? The trailer shows the same scene and...well, it shouldn't have shown all of it.

I try not to watch trailers for exactly this reason. Many of them give away too much of the story. This one is just way too blatant.

The movie is good. The story is good. The acting is good. The suspense is very good. (If you don't watch the trailer.)",1453593600,,970,4.443820224719101

Set as a POW movie in Italy as the Allied forces begin their penetration, shot down pilot COL Sinatra falls into the position of highest ranking POW in the camp.  As such, he comes with more current situational awareness than the camp's long-time occupants.  The slant he puts on things doesn't sit well with them.  When the Italian guards abandon their posts in the face of the Allied advance, the German occupiers pick up the chase of the escaping prison occupants.  Sinatra's German guard overpowering plan works, but succeeds also in transforming  his high-minded ideals to hard-bitten realities.

It definitely doesn't have the drama, the star power, and the character development of, say, Stalag 13, but I'd give it four stars.  I'm not a big Frank Sinatra fan, and sometimes his swagger and bravado was a bit over-the-top, but he carried the movie pretty well and the plot kept my attention.

271102,5,6300246795,"VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has come and gone many years ago. The sounds of screeching steel along the rails and the distant sound of the steam engine whistling its way to freedom have long been silent, but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, Jerry Goldsmith's moving score, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche. I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. This is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart. To paraphrase ... I once told you Ryan, if only one gets out, it's a victory. That still brings a tear to my eye.

The cast includes Frank Sinatra, Trevor Howard, Raffaella Carra, Brad Dexter, Sergio Fantoni, John Leyton, Edward Mulhare, Wolfgang Preisse, James Brolin, John Van Dreelen, Adolfo Celi, Vito Scotto, Richard Bakalyan, Michael Goodliffe and Michael St. Clair.",1424736000,,1432,4.941908713692946

The accuracy brought no complaints from him- only compliments for this amazing movie. He gets very upset if something is not accurate to the period......like painting American Tanks and Half-tracks to look German (i.e. Guns of Navarone - a great movie but......). But when there is accuracy, he can truly enjoy the entire movie, regardless if based upon a true story or 100% fictional; as can I....LOL.

271229,4,6300246795,"Essentially a WW2 chase film that has to be enjoyed on it's own terms.

Ryan's P-38 looks like a model in the air, but certainly doesn't sound like an Allison powered fighter.  The burning mockup on the ground has pre-war markings.

The Me-108's used as fighters were actually general purpose aircraft, but have often been used as fighter stand-ins.  The Germans did develop air to air rockets that were used on Allied bomber formations, and later on Russian tanks.  The use of them to blow down the mountain on the train is actually a logical use, though they could have shot up the train engine boiler instead with cannon or machine guns.

The train action becomes more frequent as the film moves towards the climax, though this film doesn't have the intensity as The Train film from the previous year.",1411257600,,804,4.707142857142857

Frank Sinatra plays an American colonel shot down in Italy. He ends up in an Italian prison camp where most of the other prisoners are from an old line British regiment.

The Italian guards desert and leave the prisoners to fend for themselves. Sinatra's character guides the prisoners out of the camp but they are recaptured by Germans and put on a train to another camp.

Sinatra orchestrates a takeover of the train and diverts it to Switzerland and freedom.

Great movie. Great cast. Great story. Not a lot of action but enough to keep it interesting.

Trevor Howard plays a British major who is not quite all there. Edward Mulhare plays the British chaplain, and very well.

While it gets some mediocre ratings from some, and while the plot may be considered to be ""implausible""; nonetheless, it's a fast-paced action film and do-able in a ""realistic"" sense of the word. The message herein is one of ""putting others before yourself"" - even in time of war. The character of  Col. ""von Ryan"" (Frank Sinatra) was, throughout the film, more interested in saving the lives of others under his ""command"" than he ever was in saving himself, even to the extent that it cost him his life at the very end. ""If only one of us makes it out, it would've been worth it...!"" was the overall theme. They sure as hell don't make magnificent films like this anymore!!",1402704000,,748,4.582089552238806

Today, I noticed that the HD version had been added to the list of free Amazon Prime movies available, so I gave it a look. I'm happy to report that the picture quality is excellent, much better than I had anticipated. Yes, there's a bit of DNR wash-out on some of the faces in group shots, but the picture is clean and steady and the colors are MUCH better than I remember them from typical TV broadcasts (probably due to a discreet use of edge enhancement in the digital mastering). The widescreen version is used and it is much superior to the pan-n-scan that usually serves on b'cast TV.

The sound is a little brittle and edgy, but that was mitigated by simply turing the volume down on my surround set up - and I do recommend availing oneself of their stereo surround set-up to watch this film as there's lots to be gained by doing so.

271524,4,6300246795,"WWII was a big war fought in many theaters. It was great fodder for Hollywood who spewed out a decent number of well made films. You can add this to the pile.

Here's the scoop. Von Ryan (Frank Sinatra) is a U.S. pilot shot down in Italy and ends up in an Italian POW camp. As the Allies are invading Italy, the prison guards figure they better not hang around, making the the prisoners' escape easy. They get recaptured by some Nazi pukes and are put on a train headed for a Nazi puke POW camp. They manage to hijack said train and head for Switzerland. Of course the road isn't all that smooth.

This is a big, stable Hollywood production. A fair number of large names are on hand to helm the main roles. Trevor Howard plays the commanding officer of the British faction of prisoners. He's a big pain in the you know what and criticizes or fights Sinatra at every turn. Sinatra is a natural. He fits his role comfortably. And it's funny how James Brolin's name is in the opening credits yet I only remember him in one scene and he utters not a word. Musta had a good agent. All the second tier actors do a stand up job. The production values are good. Location shooting was pretty decent. The special effects were suspect but that's a sign of the times. Mark Robson directed with a steady but rather unremarkable hand. Jerry Goldsmith handled the score and he wrote some tasty tunes. There was a bit of humor thrown in to keep things from getting too overwrought.

This is not an elegant meal. It's strictly meat and potatoes, but great comfort food for a cold night.",1364601600,,1569,4.384879725085911
271525,4,6300246795,"The first time I watched Von Ryan's Express was in Junior High, one of many fine movies our Audio Visual Department procured for the students viewing pleasure over the span of three years we were there.  The movie starts out in an Italian prisoner of war camp run by a Fascist Italian Officer, who rules with an iron fist; and interacts most unfavorably with his American and British captives.  At the same time the highest ranking officer in camp is Brit Officer Maj. Eric Fincham played by Trevor Howard, who in his own right rules with an iron fist, and interacts most unfavorably with many of his fellow prisoners...in particular the allied contingent.  Maj. Fincham for his own reasons is hoarding medicines, clothing, etc., from the prisoners...many of whom most desperately need it for their survival.  In enters American Air Force Officer Colonel Joseph Ryan (played by Frank Sinatra), who just happens to be higher ranking than his British Counterpart Fincham.  Colonel Ryan immediately takes control; one of his first orders being to free up the medicine and/or anything else the prisoners require from Fincham's hidden stash.  Be prepared too for what is undoubtedly the funniest and most entertaining moment of this movie involving the non disbursal of clothing to the prisoners by their Italian captors...and how they (the prisoners) go about getting what they want.  What happens next is the allied forces have all but won the war and the Americans and British are released from their imprisonment, though Fincham is out for blood and wants to execute the fascist commandant, of whom is responsible for many prisoner deaths.  Ryan, however, wants no part of it...and instead chooses a different form of punishment for him.  As expected a mass exodus occurs where both the Americans and British must work hand and hand to find their way to a neutral country and ultimate freedom.  Because of Col. Ryan's lenient treatment of his captor, amongst other things, is given the name Von Ryan by the British Officer.  Sophia Loren, among other great supporting actors, also do a fine job of acting and help make Von Ryan's Express the true movie classic it remains to this day.  From a guy who grew up watching truly great movies, I give this movie a solid 4 star rating.  I hope this small sampling of Von Ryan's Express, is enough to wet you're curiosity and appetite for what you're in store for, if you decide to order this movie from Amazon.

The sounds of screeching steel along the rails and the distant sound of the steam engine whistling its way to freedom have long been silent, but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, Jerry Goldsmith's moving score, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche.

I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war.

This is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart. The extras are very good, very nostalgic, very informative and peeked my intersect.

271641,4,6300246795,"""Von Ryan's Express"" was a major 1960s war movie.  Seeing it again after all that time I am pleased to say that it has lost none of its zip.  Frank Sinatra plays Colonel ""Von"" Ryan, a shot-down US fighter pilot captured by the Italians, who at that time are fighting on the Axis side.  When Ryan reaches the camp he finds that the mostly British prisoners are dirty, unkempt, and defiant against their Italian captors.  Ryan (who is the ranking POW officer) is at first is reluctant to assume command, but eventually decides that the British approach is futile and bad for the soldiers, and spit-and-polish becomes the order of the day.  Ryan's reasoning is that it is pointless to risk lives trying to escape since the advancing American Army is expected to liberate the camp within weeks.  Ryan's tough approach to discipline, and his willingness to nominally cooperate with the Italian command earns him the name ""Von"" Ryan from the British commander (well-played as usual by Trevor Howard) based on the accusation that Ryan has more in common with the German enemy than Allied soldiers.

Eventually the camp is freed from Italian control, and that is where the fun begins.  This is a rousing, rocking story of POW escape with a twist, and anyone who enjoys war flicks will enjoy this one.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1328227200,4,1319,4.79646017699115

271689,4,6300246795,"Synopsis
 Colonel Ryan (Frank Sinatra) leads a daring escape attempt across Italy.  His men hate him, he faces constant opposition from a British Major (Trevor Howard), and from the German soldiers that are only a few steps behind him.  This thrilling chase film is an exciting cross of The Great Escape and The Train.

Sexual Content
 Early on in the film, Ryan orders his soldiers to undress and burn their uniforms so that they will receive the new ones promised them by an Italian officer (we see a far out view from behind, and a few close-ups from the front above the waist).  Later, when Ryan captures the train, it is discovered that a German officer's mistress is on board.  We see her in a slightly low-cut nightgown.  Later, she tries to seduce Ryan (mild, and children probably won't notice this).  He resists and leaves her angered.
Violence
 Many shootings and explosions.  Some blood is visible in the aftermath, but none during the actual scenes.  Several German soldiers are strangled (mild) and a few POW's are seen caught on fire (also mild).  Several main characters are killed and (SPOILER WARNING) a woman is shot in the back to prevent her from escaping.
Language
 Scattered D-words, H-words, and a few B-words.  Surprising for the time, but mild by today's standards.
Morales
 Characters drink, smoke, and curse.  Killing innocent people is suggested in order to save the POW's escape attempt.  A main character shoots a woman in the back.  One of the main characters is a Catholic priest.  He is shown in a positive light, and not to be a fake, however the other characters often make jokes as his expense.
Conclusion
 Moderately exciting war film that falls short of The Great Escape, but is still far superior to most films of the genre.  Frank Sinatra gives a decent performance, but it is hard to picture the middle-aged actor as a ""hot-shot flyboy"".  The real excitement comes from the film's final action scene with planes chasing the train through mountain passes, in a scene that loses little in terms of modern special effects.  The ending is slightly surprising and fairly downbeat, but overall this is a good film for fans of old war movies.  Depends on your family whether the kids get to see it or not.",1266624000,,2240,4.755844155844156
271690,5,6300246795,"I believe that this movie is one of the best screen performances Frank Sinatra has ever given, the screen play is also excellent, this movie has been under rated in my opinion as many of Sinatra's movies are.

271691,4,6300246795,"Von Ryan's Express is one of Sinatra's best starring roles. Sinatra, notorious for only doing one or two takes per scene, turns in a fine performance. He hated doing more than a couple of takes because he felt it caused the ""freshness"" of the scene becoming ""stale"". In Von Ryan's Express he got all of his scenes right.

Col. Ryan (Sinatra) is an American Army Air Corps pilot that is shot down over Italy near the end of the Italian Campaign. One of the earliest scenes sets the tone of the movie: The Germans go to the crash site to capture the pilot but the Italians have already gotten him; in an act of defiance they tell the Germans he never got out of the burning wreckage. When the Germans leave the Italian soldiers blow a raspberry. When they part there's Col. Ryan drinking from a wine bottle. He's taken to a POW camp that's run by the Italians. Maj. Fincham (Trevor Howard) is in charge of the POW's due to the C.O. having just passed away the previous night. The camp is mostly British with only a handful of Americans present. Ryan issues new orders that all escape attempts are to cease immediately (thus the new name, Von Ryan). His reasoning is that they won't be prisoners longer than 90 days. Ryan is appalled at the malaria that's rampant & the filthy rags the prisoners are wearing.

Battaglia (Adolfo Celi) is the Italian camp commander & is a petty tyrant who's been using the Red Cross supplies for the prisoners as a supplement to his income by dealing them on the black market. His aide, Capt. Oriani (Sergio Fantoni) is much more sympathetic & caring. He, in fact, becomes part of the later escape attempt.

Edward Mulhare portrays Constanzo, a priest. He plays a pivotal role later in the film because he is fluent in German thus enabling the escape attempt to a further degree.

Wolfgang Preiss portrays Maj. von Kleinment, the commander of the prisoner train.

There's also Brad Dexter as Sgt. Bostick. Dexter being the least successful, at least as an actor, of the cast from The Magnificent 7. James Brolin has a small role as Pvt. Ames.

Von Ryan's express is an extremely well paced film directed by Mark Robson. There's hardly a slow minute nor anything that terribly stretches the credibility of the events that are shown. Col. Ryan is an extremely likable character that has everyone's best interests in mind. This is one of those films that I hope the ending will be different each time that I watch it; I know that to be an impossibility but just once I'd like to see Col. Ryan make the escape.

This version of Von Ryan's Express has a bonus disc full of bonus features. The film is in excellent condition & is in the widescreen format.",1237248000,5,2678,4.555093555093555

271694,5,6300246795,"Von Ryan's Express (VRE) is classic WWII `escapist' entertainment.  Frank Sinatra stars in the suspenseful adventure that involves a train commandeered by a group of liberated Allied POW's in Italy, making a desperate bid for freedom, with the German army close behind.  Although this two disc version of VRE provides additional information about the film, and has some informative bonus features, you may want to pass, if you already own the regular edition of the film.  Much of the focus is directed at legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith, and while Goldsmith did marvelous work in both film and television, it seems a bit odd having the music department sharing the spotlight with the megastar Sinatra.

The bonus disc contains four short featurettes, trailers, TV spots and a still gallery.  Very nice, but this content totals less than an hour.  Also included are four, high quality, miniature replicas of lobby cards.

As the sole bonus feature on the main disc, Goldsmith's musical score is isolated, and combined with a new commentary track.  Rousing and exciting when it needs to be, and poignant as well, Goldsmith's music is an excellent match for the onscreen action.  The composer seems to have taken a minimalist approach, as only about 27 minutes of the film has music running underneath.  VRE runs 117 minutes, and during most of the remaining 90 minutes, commentary is provided by producer Nick Redman, musical historian John Burlingame, and screenwriter Lem Dobbs, who discuss both the music, and other matters concerning the film.  Their commentary is rather low-key and analytical, mostly centered on Sinatra, and putting VRE in historical context.  Running between the sections with music, the commentary is interesting, though disjointed at times.  Unfortunately, aside from Sinatra, not much is said about others in the cast, like Trevor Howard or Edward Mulhare.  Raffaella Carra receives some critical hits from the panel.  No mention at all is made of actors Adolfo Celi, Sergio Fantoni, Wolfgang Preiss, or Vito Scotti.

The film was shot in Hollywood, and at various locations in Europe.  Prior to VRE, Sinatra had been in Hawaii, directing his first (and only) film, None But the Brave (1965), a WWII adventure set on an island in the south Pacific.  While in Hawaii, Sinatra was apparently saved from drowning by Brad Dexter, who became a close friend.  Thanks to Frank, Dexter appears in VRE with fourth billing.

According to information in the bonus materials, Twentieth Century Fox's epic, Cleopatra (1963) was a financial bomb, and the crippled studio was backing VRE, looking for it to deliver solid returns at the box office.  Similar to `The Great Escape', the screenplay was modified to increase the level of action, and boost the film's appeal.  VRE was based on a book by David Westheimer, who actually was a POW in Italy.  Westheimer worked on the original screenplay, and other writers later contributed to create a more action-packed and exciting, though unrealistic story.  When Old Blues Eyes signed on, the Von Ryan character was rewritten to reflect his personality.  During production, Sinatra was demanding and temperamental, and had issues with director Mark Robson.  It was Sinatra who insisted that his character die, and he refused to film an alternate ending.

Jerry Goldsmith, who wanted to be a composer from an early age, won an Oscar for The Omen (1976).  A true giant in the industry, he scored many other films in his long career, including The Planet of the Apes, The Blue Max, Patton, Chinatown, Our Man Flint, Papillion, Logan's Run, The Sand Pebbles, Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Deep Rising, Supergirl, Alien, Poltergeist, Air Force One, Mulan, and Star Trek the Motion Picture.  Though his score for Von Ryan was excellent, because of lack of material, a soundtrack was never released.  Goldsmith passed away in 2004 at the age of 75.

Von Ryan's Express is a classic film that is very much indicative of a particular time, style, and genre of filmmaking.  Featuring a charismatic star, it sweeps you along and takes you on a tense and exciting journey.  This edition is certainly the one to get, but for those that already own the standard version of the film, unless you really love Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra, or perhaps Jerry Goldsmith, it may not justify a repeat purchase.",1230768000,3,4353,5.051820728291316
271695,4,6300246795,"The movie is good time pass, there are numerous movies that exploit WWII and this is ok, one of the better. It lacks emotional intensity of Great Escape or the thrill of Burt Lancaster's Train, Sinatra looks silly and many scenes including the escape on the train are downright stagey. Still there is some humor and Trevor Howard does a neat job. Worth watching once.",1230336000,,367,4.661538461538462
271696,3,6300246795,"Although not as thrilling as John Frankenheimer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Train/dp/079284047X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Train</a>, starring Burt Lancaster, who did his own stunts, ""Von Ryan's Express"" is still a mild diversion.

The main problem with this film, as I see it, is that, unlike ""The Train,"" there is no one particularly nasty adversary who embodies all the evil and stubbornness that stands in the way of the goal, in this case, an  escape by POWs. Instead, the escapees are merely trying to evade the German army rather than a monomaniacal officer.

Wolfgang Preiss, who also appeared in ""The Train,"" does his usual turn as a Nazi officer, but he is not a major figure. 'Von' Ryan (Frank Sinatra) is only mildly opposed by the British officer (Trevor Howard),  who questions his methods. As a result, the tension between the two personalities is rather tame.

I suspect that Sinatra didn't want to share center stage with Howard, who is quite capable of portraying a nasty piece of work if given the opportunity.

Disc One contains the movie and ""An isolated track score with commentary,"" a confused affair that didn't live up to expectations. Disc Two has four modest featurettes and a few odds and ends.

271719,4,6300246795,"I'm not a big fan of fictional war movies.  I mean, come on, there were so many heroic events that took place that there should never really be a need to make a plot up.  But, Von Ryan's Express is fiction, and it's actually pretty well done.

The plot is a little weak at times.  For the life of me I couldn't understand why, when only 6 miles from the coast the men all stopped and rested.  If I'd been a prisoner of war for years and was only a 2 hour march from my own troops and freedom I wouldn't have stopped for anything.

Still, Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard do a nice job in their rolls.  In fact, I'd say solid acting all the way around with some supporting rolls being just outstanding.

The uniforms, weapons, and other equipment appear to all be accurate and authentic.  This is a real import thing to me as we've all watched movies with American tanks painted desert yellow pretending to be Rommel's panzers.  The only glaring mistake is using three trainer aircraft to represent German fighter planes.  But, hey, how many actual German fighters still existed in 1965.  I'd bet very few so the use of trainers, while unfortunate, is understandable.

271722,2,6300246795,"Circa 1862 a group of Union Army volunteers went to hijack a locomotive in Tennessee and drive it north to sabotage the Confederacy which had much less railroad equipment. These volunteers did not succeed, those who did not escape were executed. Around 1927 this historical incident was used for the silent film ""The General"". This 1965 film used the story of a hijacked train as the basis for a revisionist WW II drama. It used the outlook of the 1960s to recreate a 1940s story. How well does it work? You can see echoes of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" in this story, which has more comical elements than that 1957 film. The book is usually better than the film in most cases.

Frank Sinatra plays an Air Corps Colonel whose airplane was downed and he was captured by the Italian army. [Would such a high-ranking officer be involved in combat as a fighter pilot?] The film shows a POW camp and the personality conflicts with a new leader. [Do you see any influences from the 1964 film ""The Great Escape""?] Most of the film is involved with how the prisoners hijacked their prison train and then escape by railroad. After some combat they manage to flee to Switzerland. But Colonel Ryan is the last man running and does not join the others; this provides a dramatic ending.",1212192000,,1276,4.572052401746725

Sinatra was a very underrated actor-""From Here to Eternity"", 'The Manchurian Candidate"", this film, et al. Perhaps his singing or his ""friends"" detracted from his filmwork,  but most of it was first rate. Howard may be even better in this film, a realistic contrast of British ""duty"" to American expediency. In the end, Ryan must die for two reasons:too many gaffes have left too many dead, for which he must atone, and secondly, any other finale would have been trite,even absurd.

In order to get the freedom, this bunch of brave men will have the best they can, from their particular trench.

The story of a group of POWs in wartime Italy attempting to escape for freedom via train is told in heavy-handed, obvious - not to mention juvenile - fashion. With German soldiers this dumb, Hitler never had a chance.

Sinatra and Trevor Howard are actually quite good but are surrounded by second-rate acting talent. With believability jettisoned early on, this ""boys own"" adventure becomes downright tedious.

It's also much more entertaining than it has any right to be as Frank Sinatra's unpopular new senior officer leads several hundred prisoners of war to freedom by hijacking a Nazi train and conning his way through Italy to Switzerland while Trevor Howard's old school British officer snipes at his bad form all the way and Edward Mulhare's loveable padre impersonates a German officer to get them past the checkpoints. Yep, it's The Great Escape meets The Train, with Great Escaper John Leyton along for the ride just in case anyone misses the connection. As big, not quite as dumb as it could be entertainment it certainly does the trick, throwing in an enjoyable if sparse Jerry Goldsmith score and a particularly memorable finale.

Sadly the new 2-DVD release really is hard to recommend for any but hardcore Jerry Goldsmith fans, the only notable extras being an isolated score track and a brief featurette on the composer. Aside from trailers and TV spots, the rest is made up with talking heads background featurettes with none of the films surviving participants contributing.

The artwork usually reflects the original poster art of the movie (the Studio Classics series tended to reflect the old video covers of the 70's & 80's). The DVD inside has the same artwork in its jewel case. The card wrap is a nice touch and lends the issue a classy feel. Some of the titles are 2DVD sets, all are restored transfers in one way or another - many exemplary (some have been criticized in minor ways) and some of the sets (like this one) come with lovely Lobby Card Postcards reproducing the original promotional shots of the film. Some even have a poster.  The Card Wraps are NOT numbered or sequenced in any way (both the Studio Classics series and the Cinema Reserve series ARE numbered on their spines). Each CCC issue has a dedicated inlay - usually 2 or 3 pages - and each is full of great info about the shoot - the stars - the release - it's legacy etc. The discs themselves are loaded with fascinating extras, re-mastered soundtracks, archive material etc.... Fox has to be praised for this. The series is clearly building momentum in the States and is gaining the respect among collectors and lovers of film that say the WARNER BROTHERS SIGNATURE COLLECTION boxes have.

As a lover of oldies and classics, I thought I'd compile a list of these for fans here in the UK; many of these tiles are obscure and are REGION 1 only. I've cobbled this list together from several sources and the obvious sites for Fox, but if there are inaccuracies/additions/substractions, then please feel free to point them out. Titles in the Series are listed as follows - Film Title (Principal Actors), Original Year of Release, DVD Year Of Release, No. of Discs and (Any Other Relevent Info). Also wih regard to the Artwork on Amazon USA and UK: some of these new re-issues display the artwork of older issues which of course is confusing; however, in some cases, customers have provided pictures of the new CCC packaging themselves - I've noted this in the list below wherever possible.

Yikes! That took me a few hours!

Now back to this issue.
Disc 1 has the movie and the transfer and restoration is gorgeous - great colour - very little if any scratches - score in 5.1 - Isolated score Track with Commentary by three knowledge types.

Disc 2: (a) Reliving The Adventure Of Von Ryan's Express, 2007 featurette with great on-set footage of Sinatra and Howard and filming in the mountains, rewrites of the script etc (about 30 minutes)
(b) Hollywood & The War, 2007 Featurette on War Movies in General (including Von Ryan) - a little superfluous to requirements, but interesting nonetheless (about 20-25 minutes)
(c) The Music Of Von Ryan's Express, 2007, probably the most pointless piece on it - it consists of Jerry Goldsmiths excellent score being highlighted as parts of the film are played - that's it - just bits of the film being played with his music in it - any fool could have made this and it smacks of filler. Far better is...
(d) Bringing Movies To Life: The Legacy Of Jerry Goldsmith, 2007 featurette on the legendary composer with superb family footage and interviews, clips from Planet Of The Apes and how he revolutionised how movie music was used - his drums and piano runs on Von Ryan literally carrying the action along.
(e) Original trailers and (f) TV Spots (g) Stills Gallery. Unfortunately, Disc 2 feels like it could easily have been fitted onto Disc 1.  Still, there is stuff here for lovers of Sinatra, Howard, Goldsmith and the movie itself.

The booklet is very informative and the envelope of Lobby Cards an absolute treat (why don't they have these in ANY of the UK CINEMA RESERVE releases??)

A Sunday Afternoon classic then - it's not The Great Escape or The Battle Of Britain for sure, but it is entertaining. I'll definitely be collecting more titles in this series. And the print was just superb - that's what I want most - good films presented to me - Joe Public - in a good way.",1188432000,6,18166,4.837246703119974
271753,5,6300246795,This classic Sinatra film has been given the royal treatment. Good extras with excellent remastering. A must buy for the war movie fan or Sinatra collector!,1187740800,4,156,5.038461538461538
271754,4,6300246795,"This entertaining Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard movie is a lighter version of ""The Bridge over the River Kwai"".  I wonder if that is how the writers sold the idea to a studio.  Only the Allied prisoners are in 1943 Italy not Burma.  British prisoners resist their captors' attempts to break their spirit in a similar ""Bridge over the River Kwai"" fashion.  The hot box from the earlier movie sees duty here.  The few American prisoners show more flexibility and are accused of being opportunists by the British.  However, then the parallel breaks down.  The Italian war effort collapses and the prisoners flee their unguarded prison.  Now Von Ryan's express becomes an escape movie and a rather enjoyable series of deadly encounters and close calls.  The movie was made too long after the war to have the conviction and passion of movies made immediately during and after the war.  Stereo types assert themselves:  we know the Germans are bad but efficient.  We know that Italians, for the most part, are a decent if excitable people.  Americans can be misunderstood by the British because they are pragmatists.  The ending is not quite happy.  This is war after all.  And war, in the pre-Vietnam 1960s, is, if not quite hell, then, at least, heck.  While enjoying the adventure in times of peace, we forget the pain, the humiliation, the torment of real war.",1186099200,4,1360,4.818181818181818
271755,5,6300246795,"Gorgeously shot on location in Italy, Mark Robson's underrated 1965 war drama is clever, credible, and exceedingly suspenseful. The ensemble cast, including Sinatra as rugged Colonel Ryan and Trevor Howard as a rigid British officer, really clicks. Director Robson keeps the action brisk on this ""Express,"" resulting in a breathless ride with a stunner of an ending.",1183334400,7,366,5.43859649122807
271756,4,6300246795,"Sinatra is a cool American, whose P-38 is shot down over Italy in August 1943... The Allies were landing in Southern Italy, when Ryan is brought to an Italian prisoner of war camp...

Sensing that the end is underway, the Italians were trying to get out of the war, and the Nazis were trying to keep the Allies out and the Italians in...

A Fascist bully (Adolfo Celi) has ruled the POW camp, but with the collapse of Italian rule, he is thrown out...

The British prisoners - professional soldiers of the 9th Fusiliers, whose constant attempts to escape have led to half rations and the withholding of medicine - headed by a heated Major (Trevor Howard), are not in agreement with the unpopular pilot, Colonel Joseph Ryan... They think him insufficiently hostile to the Italians and have given an insulting 'von"" to his name, insisting that he is in the wrong army...

The British get along with Ryan, however, when the escape is engineered... They seize a German train, and, impersonating German troops even as they evade German pursuers, try to make a run for it to the Swiss border... The viewers can forget about realism from that moment on... 'Von Ryan's Express' is pure adventure and courts no moral dilemmas in its story...

Director Mark Robson tries to combine the suspense of 'The Great Escape' with the exciting action of 'The Guns of Navarone,' and he's successful enough... The pace is quick... The Italian locations are attractive... The confrontations with German troops are well handled...

Ryan is a pragmatic character not unlike the far more tragic Col. Nicholson in 'The Bridge on the River Kwai.' As a colonel master-minding commando raids, he brings the film to a great climax on an Alpine viaduct...

With the exception of a strange and shocking scene where a sexy escapee is gunned down in the back, ' Von Ryan's Express' gives us the necessary thrills to be pleased...",1168905600,7,1895,4.794478527607362
271757,4,6300246795,"Von Ryan's Express is a fictitious gripping tale of brave men in a P.O.W. camp at the end of the war.  It takes place in Italy, and with Trevour Howard (the epitomy of the upper class English soldier)as co star, this one is a winner.  The twists and somewhat impossible actions that take place in this movie, love him or hate him, I believe this movie one of Sinatra's best, up there with ""From Here to Eternity"". Whilst the plot is to get all the P.O.W's out of Italy by taking over a train and getting it through the centre of Rome, some of the stunts used even this long ago, are spectacular.  If you like this type of underdog movie, where the good guys have to overcome all the obsticles to beat the bad guys then this is the movie for you. Even though it all happened over 60 years ago I believe we can still gain great enjoyment out of a tale like this. It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.  Does it have a happy ending, mmm the twist is there right to the end so you will have to watch it to find out.",1162684800,3,1044,4.053398058252427
271758,3,6300246795,"One of the first books that I read as a teenager (that wasn't off the juvenile shelves) was ""Von Ryan's Express"" by David Westheimer.  It was a best seller at the time and I soon discovered why.  The key to the book was the extensive middle where the Allied prisoners take over a transport train one car at a time.  It was a very suspenseful and engrossing story of one-on-one, hand to hand combat with everything at stake.  Each of something like 22 cars is depicted with a writer's skill.  When the movie came out, I went to see it with a friend.  As the first railroad car was taken, I leaned over to him and said, ""This is where it really gets exciting"".  Low and behold, after taking two or three cars, the prisoners jump all the guards at the next stop.  So much for my expectations.

The thing is, this probably is a pretty good movie.  I note the high ratings others have given it so I don't want to be overly negative.  It's more of a walk down memory lane that prompted me to write this review.  This was the movie that taught me what many others have said: With few exceptions, the book is always significantly better than the movie.  If you like this movie, read the book.",1106092800,15,1184,4.2792792792792795
271809,4,6300246795,There are two great 'behind enemy lines pow escape' movies and the great escape is one and so is this.  I don't like Sinatra's music but his ww2 movies were really good.,1092700800,2,169,4.28125
271810,4,6300246795,"My apologies in advance to the legion of fans out there, but somehow the idea of a ""good"" Frank Sinatra film seems oxymoronic.  But this is a fine film, with Sinatra believable as the American martinet, and a simply outstanding supporting cast.  I must single out for special mention the wonderful performance by Edward Mulhare, a much underrated actor, who rarely had the opportunity to show what he could do.  His performance as Father Costanza is a gem, and one of the elements that makes this movie really work (and his German is excellent!).",1065398400,3,546,4.787234042553192
271811,5,6300246795,"First of all, I'm only 19 years old and part of the new-age technology generation; yet I can't get enough of this movie. Sinatra and his supporting cast are truly unbelievable in this suspense-filled drama about a bunch of POW's trying to run north to escape Italian and Nazi control.
If you haven't seen it on American Movie Classics, then chances are you haven't seen this movie in decades. Since I'm still relatively young, AMC has been the only source for my own personal viewing of Von Ryan's Express...But not anymore. Trust me people, you won't regret this purchase. ...",1054166400,6,577,4.78
271812,4,6300246795,"This movie has all the elements of a good action movie. The outcome is uncertain. The bad guys are really bad. The hero (Frank Sinatra) is idealistic and optimistic, and suffers from bad-decision angst more than once.
The movie starts in an Italian POW camp, commanded by a heartless Italian commander played by Adolfo Celi, who some may remember as Emilio Largo in the James Bond thriller ""Thunderball"". Colonel Joseph Ryan (Sinatra) is nicknamed ""Von Ryan"" as he initially appears to be collaborating with their captors. Ryan is very optimistic and continually sees opportunity in every situation. Major Eric Fincham, played by Trevor Howard, is a pessimist, and sees disaster at every turn. Further, these two men are in conflict because Major Fincham was the ranking POW until Frank Sinatra was captured.
As the Allies appear to be threatening the region, the Italians guarding the prison leave, and suddenly the POWs have a chance to escape. Their escape is short-lived as they are soon re-captured by Germans. The POWs are placed into boxcars for transport to Germany, with the exception of the wounded, who are executed by German soldiers prior to the train's departure.
As the train travels to Germany, Ryan decides that there may be an opportunity for escape. Ryan leads the creation of a plan to eliminate the guards and take over the train, with the goal of eventually leaving the train to head for the coast and potential reunion with Allied forces. After taking over the train, the POWs first attempt to escape is thwarted when they find themselves in the middle of an Allied bombing mission. The POWs then develop an even more creative plan to escape to Switzerland. In their bid to escape the POWs must fight off the Luftwaffe and a Nazi-led troop train following close behind. The end of this movie will keep action war-movie fans on the edge of their seat until the credits roll.
There are several events in this movie that give depth to Ryan's character. Several events occur within the prison camp, such as when Ryan leads the men in burning all their clothes in order to get better clothing. Another is when Ryan supercedes Fincham in dealing with the prison commander after departure of the guards. Ryan twice saves people and twice the outcome is tragic. The first time Fincham is extremely critical of Ryan. The second time Fincham is sympathetic, but Ryan is so angry with himself he refuses to listen.
Ryan is generally optimistic and idealistic, which has often been a criticism of Americans by Europeans. On the other hand, Fincham is pessimistic and would consider himself to be a realist. These two approaches and views are compared throughout the movie, and ultimately the movie avoids answering the question as to whether one approach is better than the other. As the end of the movie approaches, it is clear that Ryan's faith in his optimism and idealism has been shaken. Similarly, Fincham has come to admire Ryan's optimism and idealism, and knows that the opportunity presented to the POWs was only as a result of Ryan's optimism. Ultimately, the movie suggests that perhaps the middle ground is the best.
This movie is one of the better war movies from the 50s and 60s, and along with ""The Great Escape"", is one of the very best POW prison escape movies. Certainly portions of the movie are unrealistic. However, look past the fictionalized account of the escape, watch the adventure, and observe the conflict of ideologies. An enjoyable to watch and well-done movie.",1054080000,46,3503,4.889075630252101
271813,5,6300246795,"Von Ryan's Express is an excellent war adventure set in Italy during WWII.  The movie is about a group of prisoners attempting to escape to freedom by taking over the train they are being transported on.  They are led by a man they hate, US Air Force Colonel Joseph Ryan, because of the way things happened in the past prison camp.  This is a very exciting movie with plenty of action and also a unique story out of World War II.  As well, the conclusion is one of the best endings to a war movie ever.  Trevor Howard's line is the perfect capper.
 This movie boasts an excellent cast to go along with fine storytelling and action.  Frank Sinatra is very good as Colonel Ryan with Trevor Howard also great as his second in command British Major Fincham.  Also joining them are Brad Dexter, Sergio Fantoni, John Leyton, Edward Mulhare as Father Costanza in a very funny role, and Wolfgang Preiss in another role as an arrogant German officer.  This is a very good movie with an impressive cast alongside a good story.  Excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also.  The DVD gives a widescreen presentation, remastered stereo, and also theatrical trailers from several movies including this one.  A worthwhile movie for Sinatra fans and action fans!",1053561600,2,1250,4.709677419354839
271814,5,6300246795,"Von Ryan's Express is a WW2 movie deserving of classic status. The action is not exactly battlefield stuff, but the movie weaves an interesting plot into a tension filled escape of POW's from the Nazi's.  Frank Sinatra's sleepy style compliments the role he plays as someone who has just escaped from a POW camp.  The supporting cast all perform admirably and it is very refreshing to have a film where the Germans actually speak German and the Italians speak Italian.  Made in 1965, the period when war movies were made in droves, Von Ryan's Express stood out amoung them as being that little bit different.  What a great time I had in the late 60's and early 70's watching these movies and when this movie came out I found it so exciting.  I have lost none of that enthusiasm for the movie today.  It is one I regularly pull out of my DVD collection and give an airing.  Okay, it doesn't have the polish of recent war movies but it has qualities that just can't be emulated even with the latest movie making technology.  Highly recommended.",1024272000,83,1042,4.564516129032258
271815,4,6300246795,"One of the best World War II action-adventure movies, Von Ryan's Express, is an exciting and suspense filled ride.  The movie follows the exploits of a group of Allied prisoners, liberated from an Italian POW camp, in their bid for freedom on a hijacked troop train.
Frank Sinatra is Colonel Joseph Ryan, a pilot shot down over Italy in 1943, shortly before the fall of the country to the Allies.  Captured, he is placed in an Italian POW camp, where the Allied commanding officer has just died as a result of punishment inflicted by the camp's Commander (Aldolfo Celi).  As the highest ranking Allied officer, Ryan assumes command, much to the consternation of the ranking British officer (Trevor Howard).  Because Italy's collapse appears imminent, Ryan seeks to immediately improve the conditions for the men in camp, at the expense of preparations for escape.  For this perceived collaboration, he is christened ""Von Ryan"" by his own side.
When Italy falls, the prisoners find themselves unguarded as their Italian captors have disappeared.  The group ventures out into the countryside, but is soon recaptured, this time by Nazi forces, who ruthlessly execute the wounded prisoners.  The remaining men are put aboard a troop train for transport to a German run POW camp.  Led by Ryan, the Allied forces commandeer the train in a violent take over.  As the train proceeds north towards the Fatherland, the only Nazi left alive is Major Von Klemment (Wolfgang Preiss).  His lovely mistress, Gabriella (Rafella Cara) is also aboard.  The German language skills of the camp's chaplain (Edward Mulhare), are put to good use as he impersonates a Nazi officer allowing the train to continue on its escape route.
During a train stop, Von Klemment and Gabriella escape from the train, and Ryan winds up killing them both.  Was it really necessary that the ""innocent"" Gabriella die, shot in the back?  The need to prevent her from telling the authorities about the escape was paramount, but running in a tight skirt, she could have been easily caught by Ryan had he just given chase, instead of exercising his itchy trigger finger.  Her death stains him further, and seems to serve as justification for his own fate.
After this pivotal incident, the remainder of the movie is a race through the mountains to the Swiss border.  With the Allies beating back the pursuing Germans all along the way.  In the end you find yourself pulling hard for ""Von Ryan"", but it is just not to be.
While the movie is very entertaining, it has been criticized for being totally unrealistic.  Real POW's have stated that they were much too weak and malnourished to engage in any activity even approaching what is shown in the movie.  Even viewed as pure fiction, this film is still very enjoyable.",1017619200,11,2772,4.899357601713062
271816,5,6300246795,"VON RYAN'S EXPRESS is a great WWII action film about allied soldiers who hijack a train to get POW's to saftey.  Frank Sinatra, in the title role, and an all-star cast are great as they try to outsmart the Germans as they drive the train through enemy territory. There are great action scenes and pulse pounding moments. However, the ending, depending on one's point of view is either classic or depressing.  Frank Sinatra was at the top of his game and popularity that he lets his character get killed in the final moments of the film practically imitated by James Brown in the DIRTY DOZEN.  Overall, a great movie!! Note: Look for James Brolin (aka Barbara Streisand's hubby) in a supporting role.",1012262400,2,699,4.713114754098361
271817,5,6300246795,"This is the best all time Sinatra film. He's great. A lone American officer stuck in an Italian prisoner of war camp that is primarily British prisoners from the beginning of the war. He finds himself the ranking allied officer. He quickly takes control and changes the situation.....
It's a good film. Fun to watch and never a dull moment. Some of the effects are a little lame, but the story is truly great.",1002585600,2,409,4.54054054054054
271818,4,6300246795,"A lot of effort went into this 1965 military war film classic.  Now you do not have to wait for the movie on American Movie Classics to see it in wide-screen.  This DVD version was released in Summer 2001.  Frank Sinatra, playing the part of a downed American pilot, leads hundreds of POWs on a dash for the Swiss frontier in this action packed movie.  Most of the action takes place on a hijacked Italian train, formerly commanded by the German military, as it winds its way ever deeper into enemy territory.

Trevor Howard and Edward Mulhare (Known best for his roles in American television shows such as The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, and Knight Rider)co-star.  Also, look for Wolfgang Preis reprising the role of a German officer for the un-teenth time in his long career (The Longest Day, Anzio, Raid on Rommel, A Bridge Too Far, Battle of the Commandos, The Train, Is Paris Burning?, Ike the War Years, etc.).

The story, either incidentally or accidentally, mirrors several actual events that took place at abandoned Italian POW camps after the armistice.  The Italian guards quit their posts and Allied prisoners awoke to find no one minding the camp. The Germans eventually moved in to establish authority, but in the few interim days there was a power vacuum.  Though the real life stories never involved stealing trains, there are dozens of stories of weakened and malnourished British and Commonwealth former POWs fleeing the approaching Germans.

The film has nonstop action, train chases, aerial attacks and scenic Italian locations.  According to an article by Wolfgang Preis, the interior train scenes were filmed in Hollywood.  Actor James Brolin, who was under contract to 20th Century Fox, makes yet another appearance in a FOX movie.  According to the unofficial Hogan's Heroes guide, the leather jacket (or jackets) worn by Frank Sinatra in the film were later worn by Bob Crane on HOGAN'S HEROES.

Action footage from VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has found its way into other films.  Most notably are scenes from the Messerschmitt attacks on the train.  In 1980 a television movie, THE SECRET WAR OF JACKIE'S GIRLS, featured the VON RYAN Messerschmitt footage poorly edited into scenes of a helicopter evading German aircraft.  Twentieth Century Fox was famous for recycling spectacular movie scenes into other theatrical and television films.  Remember how often attack scenes from TORA, TORA, TORA were found their way into movies like PEARL, MIDWAY, THE FINAL COUNTDOWN, and the televison remake of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.  Battle scenes from Patton also found their way into FIREBALL FORWARD and IKE: THE WAR YEARS.

Curiously both the antagonists and protaganists are armed with German MP-40 machine pistols.  An actual MP-40 could empty its 32-round magazine in about three seconds.  The shooters in this film have machine pistols with unlimited ammunition.  Oh well, that's Hollywood.

For 35 years those of us who were not around, too young, or too indifferent to catch this movie when it was first released in theaters were left at a disadvantage.  Growing up in the greater New York area, VON RYANS EXPRESS was only available as a yearly installment on the WABC afternoon movie, broadcast in two parts on consecutive days, or on the ever rarer late night showing.  Cable stations aired VON RYAN'S EXPRESS more often, but still in standard format.  With the release of the DVD you now have the opportunity to watch the film in all of its widescreen glory.",1002153600,11,3469,4.977430555555555
