7844026,5,6303338763,"With all his masterful skills and gifted of a powerful intelligence , Wajda built a supreme joke possibly based on real circumstances about the personal tragedy of a pedestrian , a harlequin without no will; a submissive human being who only obeys orders; a neo Mr. Slave in a totalitarian regime.

Few times in a film you will be allowed to discover the absurdity and the politic rottenness with so striking impact. Magnificent portrait about a middle state functionary who suddenly is dismissed. Since that fact all his life will become a real mess.

After his authority fall , his personal life will be sinking without piety. You will enjoy and delight this exhilarating and deconstructive puzzle which strips the crudeness and the no sense of this disappeared Status Quo.

Struggling tale and incisive with rivers of cynicism all the way . Penetrating exploration around the intimacies of the bureaucracy in those oppressive years behind the iron curtain.",1106438400,,959,5.056962025316456
7844027,4,6303338763,"Without Anesthesia is the story of a journalist who is seen as a disruption to those above him through the exploration and expression of his knowledge.  It deals with many familiar Wadja themes such as isolation and  an individual facing the attack of the larger society.  Although it deals  with many Polish themes and certainly contains quite a bit of social  commentary (as all Wadja films do), I am unfortunately not knowledgable  about Polish history and can't comment on that aspect of the film.  However, I feel safe in saying that if you enjoy Wadja's other films, this  one should be on your list if it isn't already.",961632000,,626,4.731481481481482
