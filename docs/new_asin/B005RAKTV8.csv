Anyway, the anime itself has very very beautiful artwork, and there's like, no girls at all. Which I like, I'm not one to watch girl-themed anime.
The story is great, and I sobbed after some episodes. It's very fast paced, and there's tons of action, which is another plus.
It themes some at some yaoi, but nothing actually happens, which I'm both relieved and disappointed about.
When it is available to purchase, I will immediately.
It is extremely good.",1404604800,2,550,4.680412371134021
