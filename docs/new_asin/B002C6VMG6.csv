With a busy holiday schedule I didn't get around to playing it for several days, but the moment it was over for the first time she said ""Elmo, Elmo, Elmo"".  The next morning when she woke up, the first word she said was ""Elmo"".  When I come home from work, she takes me by the hand and leads me to the DVD player, saying ""Elmo"".  Elmo might want to look into a bodyguard. I am going to have to get another Elmo DVD just out of self-defense because I pretty much know this one by heart now.",1263513600,,555,4.073394495412844

From the moment it starts until the second it ends, my baby is captivated by the colors, the puppets, and the songs. This animal composition talks about all sorts of animals and gives very vivid pictures and scenes. There's one story about frogs that is so informative and adorable. They include videos and slow motion clips of frogs jumping from lily pads to trees. The video clips remind me of planet earth videos. It's so awesome that my daughter is interested in watching Elmo's World and is learning so much at the same time. I also don't mind watching it with her because honestly, i'm learning a few things too.
