8308128,5,B001H8YAZ0,"I've learned a ton from this dvd.  He goes through tons of exercises in a way you can follow exactly what he is doing, and accurately stresses the importance starting slow, and working the speed up, Only after you can play it well.
Also great advice on proper stretching, and warm ups.
Bittner has been a favorite drummer of mine, for years.  Nice to get advice from one of the very best.",1441324800,,388,4.375

8308131,5,B001H8YAZ0,"Jason Bittner uses his great techniques and humor to teach double bass and hand techniques. The place the drums are is not the best place since it's quite small, but hey, Jason fullfills this con with great exercises and songs from Shadows Fall and other projects he's been in. Nice foot camera, shows his foot techniques on every needed time.",1276300800,3,343,4.733333333333333
8308132,5,B001H8YAZ0,"This product was available for pre-order last December and my copy arrived on Christmas Eve.
Jason and Hudson Music have created an outstanding package.  There is a wealth of material here and it is clearly presented in every way.  The video and audio quality are excellent.  The PDF is well designed and easy to follow.  Jason's experience doing clinics is evident in his confident and well-prepared delivery.
I have seen a large number of drum videos and this is quite probably the best in this genre.",1231804800,5,503,4.813953488372093
