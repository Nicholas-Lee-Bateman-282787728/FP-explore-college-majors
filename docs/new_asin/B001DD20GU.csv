3528399,5,B001DD20GU,I really liked this movie. It's thought provoking and gives us views of the similarities between countries in brain washing and torture. I think it could be a good teaching film. It's certainly worth seeing. I purchased it.,1355961600,,223,4.894736842105263
3528400,4,B001DD20GU,"This movie has done a pretty good job to Revive Pakistani cinema, many good and educated families for the very first time visited cinemas and public response about KKL was superb. Cinemas houses were packed and even lot of people come back home again for the next show or waited in a long queue to watch this movie. Shoaib Mansoor is a brilliant director and film producer, his new venture was like a RAPID FIRE which burnt the whole country crowd with fumes of excitement and applause. We expect that he will continue this effort of giving good movies to Pakistan Film Industry which is almost dead. We are proud of legendary star - Mr Shoaib Mansoor.",1304035200,,652,4.581196581196581
3528401,5,B001DD20GU,One of the good movie i've seen. Background score is excellent and Shoaib Mansoor does a creditable job in direction.,1285372800,,117,4.9
3528402,5,B001DD20GU,"The story is very practical. The acting of Naseeruddin Shah is superb. I wholeheartedly agree that the misinterpretations of the great religion of Islam, by uneducated or half educated Mollas, has led to the creation of a CORRUPTED segment of Muslims. The Muslims are being taught baseless Hadith by those half educated and half witted  Mollas, and, NOT the real BOOK, THE QURAN. I also believe that it should be dubbed in most of the languages spoken in Muslim countries, and, widely distributed. It should be a ""must-see"" movie for those Muslims who claim to be Muslims but are really not. I specially like the comment about so many Hajis, who are liars, going around the market looking for Halal Meat with haram monies in there pockets!!!",1270252800,,741,4.834645669291339
3528403,5,B001DD20GU,"This movie is incredible; perhaps not so much for its acting / technical aspects but just the sheer power it has to move people and make them think. I first saw it over a year ago and it is a movie that I still think of often. You will not regret watching the movie, and it will likely stay with you for quite some time.",1259971200,5,320,3.9384615384615387
3528404,4,B001DD20GU,"The film is deep, rough, strong at times, many times. Acted fairly well, it tries to make sense or at least describe a lot of contradictions in the Pakistani society.",1253059200,,166,4.566666666666666
3528405,5,B001DD20GU,"I recently watched this on my friend's recommendation. It was a real piece of art and reality. The story was very engaging. To understand current dilemma of Pakistani society, it is an essential movie to watch. I highly recommend this movie without any reservation.",1244937600,7,265,5.045454545454546
3528406,3,B001DD20GU,"this was a very popular film in pakistan and now it is available in this dvd which has a choice of subtitles in english/french/german/spanish/italian/ or portugese. it is not a very sophisticated work but it has its moments. the cinematography is far superior to the screenplay and the directing (the actors were at a disadvantage). with a little more thought and a better director, it could have been made an international bestseller. the only extra included is a musical video.",1219363200,2,479,5.0
8292803,5,B001DD20GU,"A brave, thought-provoking movie. Kudos to the director and all performers. Great music.  Awesome best describes everything about this film.",1505520000,,140,6.0
8292804,5,B001DD20GU,"Insightful work. Very bold, given the climate of Pakistan at the time. The director, mostly does a good job stitching the story lines together and with a hiccup or two brings it home pretty well. Great debut for ShoMan as a film director. Naseerudin shah is amazing (as usual). Shan shows that given the right direction he can actually be a decent actor. I liked this... way more than I thought I would.",1484784000,,403,4.534246575342466
8292805,5,B001DD20GU,"Very nice and thought pervoking movie from Pakistani cinema, the print was good",1455062400,,79,5.153846153846154
8292806,5,B001DD20GU,Brilliant film with an awesome sound track.  A modern day movie of our times for the thinking generation and a soundtrack that will stay with you.  I keep seeing this movie again and again for the sound track and it never fails to impress.  It reflects the sad plight of an innocent generation caught between conflicting opinions.  Conflicting opinions and prejudices of ignorant religious leaders that contradict common sense and human dignity and an ignorant establishment that suspects all Muslims as trouble makers.,1427155200,,519,5.216867469879518

8292809,5,B001DD20GU,A brilliantly acted and directed film. The music is absolutely marvelous. A film which courageously tackles fanaticism. And it is Pakistani !,1401235200,2,141,5.454545454545454
8292810,5,B001DD20GU,"In the 9/11 era, we trashed a lot of liberties and showed our ignorance.  But, we don't have a monopoly on ignorance as this film shows from several  points of view.  The taliban trash the music and two musician brothers go separate ways - one to the extreme radical fundamentalist point of view, and the other to America to grow and learn, but he quickly gets sucked into the hysteria. The story is portrayed in a very modern way and the sound track is one of the best I've heard.  You need to see this film.  Bill B",1380499200,,517,4.23469387755102
8292811,1,B001DD20GU,Thanks a whole bunch for sending me a cracked disc. That was really helpful considering that I needed this on a deadline as it was for a school assignment. Thanks for wasting my time and not being reliable.,1371513600,,206,4.447368421052632
