5312569,5,B009B82FRI,"This is an absolutely fabulous positive live concert with Wilson Philips. The girls offer themselves and have a fantastic backing band with many well-known studio musicians. Acapela version of ""Good Vibrations"" is magical. Very nice picture quality and stereo sound. Recommended by the best.",1355529600,3,291,5.636363636363637
5312599,5,B009B82FRI,I would definatly recommend this and I love Wilson Phillips and I wish it was longer than what it was,1381449600,,101,4.1
5312600,3,B009B82FRI,this is not a bad dvd it could be a little bit longer with more of their songs from previous cds,1369267200,,96,3.619047619047619
5312601,2,B009B82FRI,Not really the kind of music i love. This means that the group is not good. Believed it was country music.,1364774400,,106,4.095238095238095
5312602,5,B009B82FRI,"after not being in the spot light singing for over 20 years the girls still sound good, but their new CD of the these songs sound even better",1362009600,,141,4.071428571428571
5312603,5,B009B82FRI,"Truly have missed this group, and hopefully get to catch them live! Awesome DVD, and great set list! Harmonies of Carnie, Wendy, and Chyna are absolutely beautiful and very well blended! AMAZING!!",1359158400,2,196,5.15625
5312604,5,B009B82FRI,"I loved the Album Dedicated, and was sad that I missed the Program when it aired. Glad to find it was available on DVD. If you like Wilson Phillips, then I think this is for you too.",1358899200,2,182,3.945945945945946
5312605,5,B009B82FRI,"The girls did an awesome job playing tunes from the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson, and the Mamas and Papa's.  I've always loved Wendy Wilson and Carnie Wilson.  Chyna too!  Chyna's Dad was in the Mama's and Papa's.  As far as I am concerned, this trio is the best that is out there.  They grew up together as kids.  As adults they are great musicians and I LOVE their voices.  I grew up in the LA area in the 60's.  It's a trip to hear them play their parent's music.  I have yet to see their concert ""LIVE"" in person.  Please come to Phoenix ladies!  I'd love to see you come out with more cd's with Beach Boys and Mama and Papa's songs.

5312606,2,B009B82FRI,"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Wilson Phillips. We have their CD's and saw them in concert when they played Chicagoland. This DVD arrived just before Christmas and we put it on when my daughter was home. She was singing along with the songs (much to my annoyance lol). But after a few songs we had to give up. For a group that made harmony their staple, they were so off key and so often that it was simply unlistenable. Very disappointing. Guess I'll post on eBay and hopefully get some of my money back. I have over 250 concert videos, good and not so good - so not keeping one is a pretty strong statement. Very unfortunate.",1356912000,8,636,4.221311475409836
5312607,5,B009B82FRI,GOOD & ENJOYABLE WITH SOME SUPER MELODIES FROM THEIR DEAR DAD'S all the Wilson's giving us such Good Vibrations a la California !!!,1356912000,4,131,4.739130434782608
5312608,3,B009B82FRI,I love Wilson Philips. They were somewhat off key. The harmony is what they do best!!!! And why a limit on how many words you have to say?,1356825600,4,138,3.9642857142857144
8539213,1,B009B82FRI,Just watched this on PBS and it is one of the worst live recordings I've ever heard.  I've seen plenty of life performances over the years on PBS and this has got to be the worst I've seen.  The harmony is horrible.  They did so many covers that they did not do any justice to.  You can see much better performances at the local bar on karaoke night.  Apologize to your parents for this Wilson Phillips.,1520553600,,403,4.25
8539214,4,B009B82FRI,"Let me say that I was 23 when they debuted with their signature hit album in 1990. This was recorded to a live audience in 2012 to coincide with their DEDICATED album honoring their parents of the Mama's and Papa's and The Beach Boys. I thought it was good, but perhaps they didn't feel the need to rehearse too much and maybe the timespan in between performing their last concert and this one played a factor. They were not as ""tight"" in the lyrics in this one, but I still enjoyed it. I have all their CDs, so I am a big fan of the group.
With 14 songs total, they performed 5 of their own songs, all big hits for them.
 I thought they performed HOLD ON the best of the entire lineup.
The sound was good and the picture quality came out looking great on the UHD 4K TV.",1500422400,,770,4.099337748344371
8539215,4,B009B82FRI,"Purchased as a gift so i didn't actually see it, however the person that i bought it for loved it.",1486944000,,98,3.95
8539216,5,B009B82FRI,I thought it was great but it could have included more of Wilson Phillips' original songs along with the tribute to their parents.,1484265600,,130,4.695652173913044

8539218,2,B009B82FRI,"The reviews were mixed so I took a chance..but needn't have. I grew up listening to Wilson Phillips and would have loved to have seen them live, that's why I bought this DVD. Off key and average is the best I can do...in fact I ended up just skimming each song, some are better then others. Such a shame",1433894400,,303,4.1525423728813555
8539219,2,B009B82FRI,"I had high hopes for this as this group are well known for their superb harmony sound. Watching it was a bit of a let down: the harmonies were not as focussed and tight as they usually are and the whole thing sounded dull, flat and unrehearsed. At times the girls were even out of tune. The preparation for this concert was featured in their reality show 'Still Holding On' and they mentioned in it that they didn't feel ready for this performance, especially given that it was being taped. Well, it shows. I put this away after watching it once and I don't think I'll be watching it again. I gave it a second star because the interview segments interspersed between the music were good to watch.",1423699200,,696,4.4453125
