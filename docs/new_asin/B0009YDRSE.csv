8070399,3,B0009YDRSE,"I found this movie of a Japanese, Hikikomori (young hermit)man and a Japanese, computer hacker girl from New York to be sorely lacking.  First, the plot was so simplistic that my cat could have understood it. Second, the acting was below average. Third, the shaky, grainy camera work left a lot to be desired and gave me vertigo. Fourth, there was zero character development and the characters were at best stereotypical and shallow.  I really cannot recommend this film and I was expecting a lot more from it than it was able to give. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars instead of 2 is that it had a lot of shots of the city of Tokyo in it which I found interesting, although I believe some of the shots were repeats and so it became somewhat redundant. The Korean movie Castaway On The Moon had a much more in depth and accurate portrayal of a Hikikomori type character than this movie did although a young hermit in Korea is probably called by some Korean word. The film gets an overly generous 3 shaky, grainy stars from me.",1345334400,,1032,4.426315789473684
8070400,5,B0009YDRSE,"Gritty, shaky, fuzzy and sometimes way too dark, this film is a delight to watch.  First it really does allow you to see Tokyo in all it's glory, from the streets, to the coffee shops to the empty, cold, rows of ATMs.  People into sci-fi, dark futures or who like the feel that there is a living person behind everything that happens within the film will enjoy the movie.",1199232000,,371,4.36231884057971
8070401,3,B0009YDRSE,"I'm back in the States now, but I checked this movie out when I was living in Japan. The beginning of the movie comes of kind of scary and dark, but a lot of the film is full of intelligent wink wink nudge nudge humor (think john waters). I was really interested to see it because I learned that it was an American director doing a Japanese language film, and even though this was his first film with the normal amount of freshman rough edges, I was glad I saw this. This is definitely a good film full of ironic humor and unexpected twists. A couple of other people mentioned the music, and that was a treat for me too, I'm hoping they announce at some point the sound track is coming out. If you are looking for a slick Hollywood feature full of the predictable then this is not for you, but if you love independent art house films with crazy plots and weird visuals, then you'll enjoy this movie.",1123891200,2,899,4.2631578947368425
8070402,3,B0009YDRSE,"I saw this movie when it was playing at the Imaginasian in NYC because the description of the movie was intriguing.  A computer hacker who needs eye surgery travels back to Japan and continues hacking, only to be caught and lead on a journey she won't forget.  It sounded fascinating.

The movie's plot was interesting, however it seemed as though it wasn't edited.  One scene between the main character and her uncle had faulty sound and different lighting with every camera angle change.  I laughed at the poor quality; however, it did not make me enjoy the film any less.

The fact that the sound and lighting was off didn't take away from the creative cinematography choices and the pleasing bright shots of Tokyo.

The soundtrack for the movie consists of brilliant music by Robotstar.  It's very electronic sounding and quite memorable.

When someone asks me what I thought about this film, I usually say, ""Oh, it was Crap! But you NEED to see it, it's great..!""  Which confuses and befuddles most - but I can't find any other way to explain it.

If you're looking for a good story and aren't picky about the consistency of the filming and sound, then this is a good movie.",1123718400,2,1179,4.647342995169082
8070403,4,B0009YDRSE,"I saw this film last year when it came to New York at the Imaginasian Theater. I've heard a few things about the whole hikikomori trend in japan, so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie takes the whole subject of shut-ins and mixes it with one of my favorite subjects, hacking. Don't expect to see someone write computer code live on screen or anything, but just the notion that a cute Japanese girl could be an expert hacker was enough to get my attention. As for the acting, I would say the actor playing Naomi reminded me of a Japanese version of Amelie. Kind of nave and innocent on the outside, but definitely smart and aggressive when she had to be.

The real standout of this movie is the actor playing Michio. This guy is crazy, and I loved it. There's one part where he does a surreal take on Robert Deniro's ""Taxi Driver"" mirror monologue that both had me laughing, and a bit creeped out. As a matter of fact, that's how much of this film made me feel. It's a oddball kind of humor mixed with a foreboding (depressing?) sense constantly hovering over Tokyo. I think only certain types will really get all the humor, kind of like American fans of BBC comedy (we are a rare bird old chap).

There's a lot of electronic music in the score, which I'm not a fan of, but it didn't take away from the film. Last thing that I can't forget to mention is that if you are interested in seeing the city of Tokyo (the real city, not studio sets), then see this film. I've only been to Tokyo once, but I'm pretty sure I saw every major Tokyo hotspot in this film that you'll ever want to visit. So even if you aren't into hackers and weirdos who don't leave their room, this movie is a great look at the city of Tokyo in all it's neon glory.",1119398400,9,1768,4.258928571428571
