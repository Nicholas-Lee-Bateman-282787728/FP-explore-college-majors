8033405,5,B0002VR6FY,"I grew up watching these old cartoons on both VHS and on the Disney Channel every morning. They sure don't make them like they used to. I hate how they're now dubbed over with new voices nowadays. Even though this program was released in 1986, I enjoyed how it was put together with intervals taken from the Walt Disney Anthology series from the fifties and sixties. Chip 'n' Dale were always my favorites besides Mickey and Goofy. This program contains three cartoons
1. Chicken in the Rough
2. Chips Ahoy
3. The Lone Chipmunks (My favorite of the bunch)",1340668800,,555,4.616161616161616
