2590811,5,B000FUTVL4,"I bought this movie to show to my kids on a long road trip, because it sounded somewhat mellow and relaxing, and it was exactly that. I was a bit concerned at the beginning that it would be hard to understand because the character's voices seem to have a slight accent to them, but after a few minutes I didn't notice it anymore. My 4 year old was entranced with the movie from the start. There were a couple moments she lost a bit of the story line and asked what/why something was happening, but her interest was still held from beginning to end. My 2 year old watched about half of it before moving on to other activities, which is far longer than I expected her to! The plot is quite subdued compared to most Disney and similar titles on the market. There is no violence or villains to contend with so there's no overly dramatic climax--it's very much a simple children's story brought to life without all the ""let's add in adult humor/thrills so the parents can stand to watch it"" type of things.

Also, I do have to say that I LOVED the soundtrack on this movie! The music was sweet, uplifting and relaxing. If the soundtrack were available on CD I'd buy it in a heartbeat!",1184544000,,1179,4.359090909090909
2590812,5,B000FUTVL4,"Laura's Star is the most wonderful, smart and non-scary movie I have ever seen. My three year old wants to watch it every other day (and I watch with her most of the time)
A must-have in the kid's DVD collection!",1182988800,,212,4.195121951219512
2590813,5,B000FUTVL4,"""Laura's Star"" shines with stardust in three key areas:

- Animation --- Very comforting animation style that combines both traditional animation and CGI elements. Soft pastel coloring that fits with the overall fantasy style of the film, but also lends a certain realness where needed. Expressive characters that translate well into many languages.

- Music --- This film includes a charming musical track that includes ""The Magic Flute"" by Mozart, a pleasing score headed by Hans Zimmer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - argh!) and catchy pop songs by a group called ""Wonderwall."" After watching this film, it makes me want to explore more of the works of Zimmer and Wonderwall as well --- a German group.

- Overall Plot and Magic --- The main plot of ""Laura's Star"" is that a family moves out of the country into a new home in the city. The girl in the family, Laura, is having trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. There are bullies to deal with and nothing is familiar. She really wants to go back to her old home, but then a little magic comes into her life --- a little star who she helps to heal and whose stardust has magical properties. Now she's off on magical adventures, but faces despair at times as well. Sure, the plot starts off a little slow at first. But I don't really mind that. I don't care either if there's not a huge amount of entertainment value or high drama. This film has a sweet charm and a rather relaxing quality at times, similar to something like ""Franklin"" or ""The Little Bear Movie"" and I wouldn't mind seeing a similar movie by the same filmmakers again.

Oh --- and great dub. This film was originally voiced in German, but they've picked a wonderful cast for the English-language release.

This DVD comes with a neat set of special features. You get commentary by the filmmakers about the production of the film, a look at the German voice recording and voice actors, background on the music and a music video of ""Touch the Sky"" and a look at the animation process. There are also a few reasonably decent games.

Unfortunately, the special features were the one area where I felt a bit more effort could have been put in. You see, this is the U.S. / English language release, but the special features haven't been localized for U.S. audiences. So generally the cast and crew are heard speaking in German. I don't even really mind this. What I do mind is that in those cases where somebody actually was speaking in English, they have *somebody else* speaking over them in German! Couldn't they have removed that?

""Laura's Star"" (""Lauras Stern"" if you prefer the German title) is a wonderful treat for animation fans and a Chicago Children's Festival award-winner. If you or your kids enjoy quality animation and are looking for something that's maybe a little different, don't pass this up.",1167696000,4,2831,4.695564516129032
2590814,5,B000FUTVL4,"My two year old loves this --the music is soothing-she loves the star(anyone who has a child who loves Dora's starcatcher). It is a bit slower and longer than what we Americans are used to, but is is a charming story with pretty illustrations and perfect music. So many themes are touched in this film-children moving, helping others, adventures in the world or sky. I will be searching out more in this series. I had chanced upon it at Walmart and was pleasantly surprized. I recommend it",1166486400,3,489,4.632183908045977
2590815,5,B000FUTVL4,"I took my 3 year old to see this at an art museum.  The auditorium had probably over 100 children between the ages of 1 and 10, and for the full 80 minutes of the film they were completely mesmerized!  I have seen a lot of Japanese anime and in my opinion the animation is very good.  The story is simple and the pace is appropriate for younger children (a little faster than Kipper).  Cute and highly recommended.",1165017600,3,414,4.269230769230769
2590816,1,B000FUTVL4,"Seeing as how this film does seem aimed at children aged 1 year and under I have apparently arrived on the scene about 24 years too late. So for everybody else who took this journey, as I did, I only have to say that if children's entertainment was always this bad no kid would ever want to watch TV. Lucky for them ""Cars"" and ""Harry Potter"" still exist. The idea seems to be that since the children who are watching this have no cognitive skills to speak of there is no good reason to really try. It also has zero crossover appeal to other demographics. And that is OK and their prerogative, but while it may be en vogue to criticize Pixar for appealing to children of all ages at least their movies don't make me wish that I was sleeping. The story is really quite vanilla, a girl named Laura moves with her family to a new city. There, having no friends, she settles in for a life of loneliness. That is until a lucky star falls from the heavens and befriends Laura. This particular star is, predictably enough, about the size of a house cat and shaped the shape (five points and all). The star turns out to be the perfect friend for Laura, or the ideal friend that none of us ever had. It lifts her up when she is feeling blue and always has her back. And in a world of bullies and parental figures who yak on the phone too much this star is exactly what she needs in her life.

The main problem here is that this filmmakes no attempt to be entertaining. Why not give the people in the audience something (anything) to chew on? Why not produce something that will challenge people at every stage of their life? Besides I can't imagine how this would be entertaining even to the tots that it is aimed at. Everything is soft and whimsical. Childhood is presented as something that must be revered. The only peril this film provides is when Laura has to race across town to deliver her mom's lucky instrument to her before her big recital. But having a lucky star on your side is a great tool to overcoming adversity, not that there is much to be found here. There are also no villains and no conflicts. So the filmmakers have filled 80 minutes with Laura floating around and above what I assume is Germany. The animation is kind of bad, and not in a retro kind of way. The closest comparison to this film I could think of was ""Spirited Away"" another movie I was not so fond of. They both involve annoying young girls who go on mystical journeys all in the name of learning life lessons. But ""Spirited Away"" had a much more active imagination and superior animation. It was the first time I had seen a German animation film, so I can at least take that away from it. In the end Laura learns the very healthy lesson that sometimes things go away and never come back. But considering how soft the rest of the film was I was left wondering if beating her over the head with this particular lesson was necessary. Yes, most people would consider being friends with a person a better idea than being friends with a star, but when you are preaching to the new born does any of this really matter. *1/2",1164240000,2,3095,4.327022375215146
2590817,5,B000FUTVL4,"This was a very sweet movie.  My 4 year old daughter adored it, and I think it's idea for ages 4-8 with such sweet innocence free of the sarcasm and bad guys found in most feature-length animation.  I love the Disney fair too, but this slower-paced, sweeter adventure of a young girl who comes across a magical star and lives with a loving family is such a nice change.  The animation is much better than most films, too, and the subtle British voices were precious.

Enjoy!",1160265600,10,474,4.476744186046512
2590818,5,B000FUTVL4,"This is a wonderful animation ... excellent quality, way superior to the regular Disney and Pixar movies. The story line is free of violence and monsters. This DVD is a visual entertainment treasure for your child.",1159574400,8,214,4.972222222222222

8126988,5,B000FUTVL4,"Beautiful divine  music is played during the  entire movie,also the content of it is so meaningful and substantial. It can NOT be compared with Disney-trash  dvd selling in large quantities out there.",1434672000,,200,5.1875
8126989,5,B000FUTVL4,Very cute story although the story was a bit different than the book. Much more of a story which appealed to my 8 yr old grandchild more than the almost 3 yr old one.,1412640000,,166,3.911764705882353
8126990,4,B000FUTVL4,"Though produced in Europe, this film has a very Miyazaki-esque feel. I'm not too familiar with the makers of the film, but the production is lavish and beautiful to look at. The story is well-suited to a film aimed at the wee folk among us, telling of a wounded star who falls and befriends the lonely girl, Laura, eventually taking her on a brilliant flight above the city at night before mending and returning to the sky. The little ones will definitely dig it, and though there's absolutely nothing that would go over small heads, grown-ups should appreciate its sweetness and just how pretty it is to look at.",1399507200,,613,4.63302752293578
8126991,5,B000FUTVL4,"My family were rain bound in a hotel in Switzerland, this was the only cartoon on. We loved it- it was in German and I we still understood what has happening. From the jaded 13 year old to the 4 year old toddler we were entranced. Magical- great art! There wasn't a dry eye near the end. Rushed home, bought the english version!.",1359849600,,329,4.238095238095238

8126993,5,B000FUTVL4,Very beautiful animation.  Story line is very imaginative.  My four year old daughter loved it so much that she wanted her own copied after watching this from her friend's so we got this for her.  Highly recommend this to any parents.,1237075200,,234,4.658536585365853
8126994,3,B000FUTVL4,"My six year old is mesmerized by this movie.  The plot itself is a little silly, but I have to admit the animation is quite beautiful.  A great winding-down, pre-bedtime movie for active youngsters.  The plot itself deals with a young girl who is finding difficulty coping with her family's recent move.  She finds an injured, fallen star, which she befriends and nurses back to health.  Eventually, the star makes its way back to the night sky and Laura realizes her new home isn't so bad, after all.  Cute movie.",1210809600,,514,4.655555555555556
8126995,4,B000FUTVL4,"We first saw Laura's Star at the National Gallery of Art during one of their family days last year.  We really liked it and rented it from Netflix.  My 3-year-old got it from Santa this year.  This is a great movie for anyone, but especially children who have moved to a new home and need to see that new experiences can be magical and families stay together through changes.",1198886400,,375,4.405797101449275
8126996,3,B000FUTVL4,"Like other reviewers said, this is a great movie. A great story and wonderful animation. A friend gave us the German version and our daughter (and me) loved it even though she (unfortunately) does not really speak German. I would have bought this without a second thought if there had been a German soundtrack. Why is it that there is an English, French, Spanish and Portuguese language track but not a German one? It's a German movie, after all. How much trouble would that have been? I will stick to my German-only copy (and the slightly less great but still entertaining 'Lauras Stern 2'). For anyone who does not care for this, it's well worth the money.",1187395200,,658,4.632478632478633
