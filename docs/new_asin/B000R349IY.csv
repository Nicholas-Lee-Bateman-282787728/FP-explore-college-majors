2857116,5,B000R349IY,"As usual Chief Inspector Barnaby does not disappoint.  Great mysteries, great acting.  I have all the series available and find them greatly entertaining.  Also must confess to mad crush on Tom.  Good viewing.",1194134400,,209,5.242424242424242
2857117,3,B000R349IY,"I hate to admit it, because I really enjoy this series and the characters in it.  I'd hate to see it come to an end, but maybe it needs to do so; for the benefit of the cast, if nothing else.

I can't help but feel that the actors have gotten sick to death of their characters, and it shows.  The only characters that still have much life are Inspector Barnaby and especially his junior officer, Daniel Scott.  That is probably due to the fact that the former is played by an amazing veteran actor who obviously believes in the theatrical adage, ""The show must go on,"" while the latter is played by a young actor relatively new to the series.

Unfortunately Joyce has become more and more listless, a shadow of her former self.  Her gentle personality and astounding patience with the crazy conditions of her marriage now seem more like major depression.  Her daughter Cullie is hardly much more energetic.  Considering that I enjoyed the dynamics of their  family very much, and the way these secondary characters managed to get into the spirit of the who dunnit, I feel like there's been a death in the family.  It seems to me that the actors have come to feel that their characters are dead end material, nothing new to do. Maybe they need to be a little more front and center.  Sort of a mother-daughter investigation team ""helping"" the inspectors.  They definitely need more to do.  Cully was shifted to a retirement center for old horses during one of this set.  What does that tell you?

While it seems to be becoming clear that Cullie and Dan Scott are ""meant for one another"" and that he is a younger version of his mentor, it seems surprising to me that the authors have not put this relationship more to the fore.  I realize, as one reviewer pointed out on one of the earlier sets, that this move may merely have been designed to pull in a younger audience, but I see no reason that it should not be usefully developed.  It need not be simple pandering to ""the young.""  Most of us enjoy a story of young love, even if we're a little passed it ourselves--are we ever?!  I could certainly see the situation as more of a ""Father of the Bride"" meets Agatha Christie.  After all, just how did Joyce and the Inspector get together?  What types of problems occurred.  What advice would they give the ""kids?""  What would Daniel do if Cullie were in danger.  He did a splendid job of rescuing her in the first season of which he was a part, but the characters have ""settled in"" as one reviewer pointed out.  They aren't even engaged yet, let alone married for 20 years for pete's sake.

I also feel that the murderers and their crimes are not nearly as goofy as they were.  Which is amazing, since one of the shows of Season Seven was totally wonderful and wacky.  ""Sins of Commission"" had so many surprising twists and turns it was delightful.

It's not as if the talent isn't there, either.  Some of the guest actors have made several appearances throughout the years, and their various characters have been splendidly crafted.  One of the most amazing things about British cinema and TV is the fact that their thespians have amazing skill and talent.  For such a comparatively small dot on the map, England has given us some very fine actors.  Maybe the fatigue I sense isn't that of the cast but of the writers.  I just wish that this series could regain some of it's liveliness again.  Come on writers: get to work on it.",1194134400,9,3428,4.483037156704362

We have all of them and this one is, as always, excellent.  Everyone in the cast is superb - how they can come up with good stories, week after week, is amazing.  If you don't have these, get them.

2857121,5,B000R349IY,"I love this series. I am a fan of the BBC mysteries (morse, frost, lynley, cadfael,christie,rosemary & thyme,cracker, waking the dead, foyle, etc). This is one of my all time favorites. The stories are always interesting and keep my attention. I prefer the British mysteries because they aren't as violent or riddled with sex as American series. They prove that you don't need those two elements to produce good tv.  The only negative thing I have to say is that this set has no closed captions--come on, can't you spring for this. When we watch the series on tv, we have captioning. That said, I can't wait for set 10.",1191715200,3,619,4.627272727272727
2857122,2,B000R349IY,"I own all the previous sets, plus all of Frost, Morse, Last Detective, Waking the Dead, etc.  Obviously a brit mystery fan, but sadly, this will be my last ""Midsomer.""  This set is dark to the point of weirdness; the Sargeant is bland and boring (bring back Sgt. Troy!); and while Joyce and Calley appear, they are extraneous and muted.  Even DCI Barnaby seems tired and quite honestly, not very bright or insightful! The whole pace seems markedly different, and not in a good way.  VERY disappointed.  If you have been a fan, try borrowing this set - not worth owning.  Unlike previous sets, this one will NOT be re-watched by this family of adults.",1191283200,,650,4.608695652173913
2857123,5,B000R349IY,"Chief Inspector Barnaby and Sergeant Scott have certainly settled into a comfortable relationship while investigating some dastardly murders in and near the lovely and comfortable little English village of Midsomer.  To me, they are every bit as good together as were Barnaby and Troy, his former partner.  Again John Nettles, as Barnaby is so very good as a very wise and mellow Chief Inspector investigating with his young and subtly humorous partner Seergent Scott as played wonderfully by John Hopkins.  I really feel they have become a very good team bouncing off each other wonderfully--Scott with his rather droll humor and Barnaby with his very wise and extremely nice manner.
The dead body count is not nearly as high as in some previous episodes; however, the stories are extremely engrossing; they kept this viewer guessing just who might have done the nasty deed(s) through out the episode until all was revealed.  I really loved the episode entitled ""Things That Go Bump in the Night"" which is filled with voices from the grave, bludgeoned heads and slit wrists,  lustful ""men of the cloth"", hysterical widows and mediums able to do spooky voices--the actress that plays the bereaved widow is really good being at one moment beside herself with grief and the next moment very funny indeed.  ""Orchis Fatalis"" is another good episode with folks being strangled, poisoned and pitched-forked to death because of a rare orchid.  In that episode there is also an appealing gardner that is ploughing more than folk's yards. Plus all of the episodes are filled with some great characters that are played by some wonderful British actors that I have seen many times in other presentations. (one example being Diana Quick)

Obviously, per usual, I really enjoyed Season Nine of the ""Midsomer Murders"" series; it certainly maintains the high standards that were set by the first seasons.",1191196800,14,1889,5.070967741935484
2857124,5,B000R349IY,"As a note, Borders started selling this boxed set on August 14.  The quality of the disks is excellent, as are the episodes, which are very well done.",1188345600,8,150,4.357142857142857
2857125,5,B000R349IY,"Midsomer Murders Set 9 is actually comprised of four episodes from Series 8:
Episode 1 - Things That Go Bump in the Night,
Episode 2 - Dead in the Water,
Episode 4 - Orchis Fatalis, and
Episode 5 - Bantling Boy.

Episode 3 - Ghosts of Christmas Past, the Christmas Special was included in the previous set.

There are three more episodes in the eighth series (Second Sight, Hidden Depths, and Sauce for the Goose), and once again, we will have to wait for another set to see them.  In England these were released in sets of 10 episodes (at $100 to $200 US per set).  If they want to issue fewer episodes per set in the U.S. to keep the price down on each set, they could still have issued multiple sets at one time, covering an entire series.

With that said, this is still my all-time favorite mystery series.  I still haven't completely adjusted to Barnaby's new assistant, but I'm liking him better with time.  Well-plotted, well-acted, with interesting guest stars.",1186704000,75,969,4.566473988439307

The murders aren't bad either. Sometimes gory, sometimes weird, but good puzzles at any rate. The viewer may sometimes guess whodunit, but not very often. To be honest, I don't watch Midsomer Murders as much for the murders as for the interaction of the characters and the  picture of village life. Is the picture a true one? Probably somewhat, but if you really want realism, watch a documentary.",1389225600,,570,4.9375
2857154,5,B000R349IY,"We were introduced to this delightful series by PBS and had to have more so we have purchased many of them from Amazon.  It is about small British villages in the shire/county of Midsomer with an amazing number of killers!  The detective assigned to this shire always solves these bizarre crimes but usually not before another killing or two.  The characters are bizarre and comical which is what makes it worth watching.  And there is no gunplay at all!

Oh, British actors use little make-up.  They pick their actors for their ability to act, not for their beauty or handsomeness.  They don't seem to indulge in cosmetic surgeries or boob-jobs.  For the rare nude shots you may be startled by the breasts.  Something is wrong?  Then you realize, the actress has not had her breasts augmented, they look natural!  Plus, the actors age in a natural way.  You will not be confused, as we have been by American shows, thinking that the ""mother"" doesn't look old enough to be the star's mother even when you know her actual age.  I am thinking we in the US will have to import actresses from the United Kingdom to play all those ""mother"" parts what with all the face-lifts.  I am not grousing about actresses getting them, as I fully intend to get one  as soon as I can afford it!",1389139200,,1277,4.5394736842105265

2857178,3,B000R349IY,"We've been watching this show on DVD and streaming and liked it a lot at the beginning. However, things are wearing a bit thin by this season. Most of the plots have become so formulaic (three murders, crazy murderer, a fourth murder prevented in the nick of time....) that it's almost a joke. I still enjoy watching Barnaby, but the secondary characters -- Scott, Joyce, and Cully -- add little. Poor Joyce -- she's become a plain jane dullard! Plus, there are so many unlikable people in the stories that it doesn't seem to matter who killed who.

There's also the matter of economics. At about $10 per episode (4 episodes per 'set' going for about $40) a show really has to be above average to make it worthwhile.  While these were being streamed on Netflix, it was worth it. Now that they've pulled all but seasons 11 and 12, buying the discs is the only option. Frankly, for me, it's not worth it.

DS Scott cocky arrogance compliments DCI Barnaby's steady competence beautifully.  The casting is superb and the acting always high caliber.

2857199,3,B000R349IY,"""Midsomer Murders, Set Nine,"" consists of four, approximately 100 minutes long, contemporary stand alone British mysteries from the long-running television series seen here on A & E and The Biography Channel.  The series first aired in the United Kingdom in March, 1997; since then, more than 55 feature-length episodes have aired, with further episodes still in production.

The series is based on the novels of Caroline Graham, who worked in the classic English village school of mystery-writing, perhaps best exemplified by Agatha Christie.  And some critics have called Graham the best detective writer since Christie.  It is filmed in the quaint, green beauty of the English countryside, in fictional Midsomer County, where nasty things, treated rather lightly, with a certain sly humor, do seem to keep on happening, as the inhabitants go about their picturesque pursuits and recreations.  These nasty goings-on frequently don't seem to have much basis in reality, nor motivation, nor backstory.  But you can expect lots of village fetes; medieval-style mounted jousting matches, and regattas.

The mysteries are:
""Things that Go Bump in the Night."" An odd group of spiritualists, and their not so spiritual leader, come under suspicion as a plague of peculiar murders hits the village of Fletcher's Cross.

""Dead in the Water.""  Set in the well-heeled world of competitive rowing, as a body turns up in the Thames River during the annual Midsomer Regatta.  Diana Quick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brideshead-Revisited/dp/B00005JLG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brideshead Revisited</a>) guest stars.

""Orchis Fatalis.""  Apparently the peaceful looking village of Midsomer Malham is inhabited by orchid-crazed individuals, ready to bankroll illicit expeditions to find extremely rare examples of the breed - or to kill for them.

""Bantling Boy.""  Lord Bantling, of a historic noble, but treacherous family, owner of Bantling Hall, dies, leaving his prize racehorse to a syndicate of four locals.  Why ever?  Anybody who knows isn't talking, and, as somebody is killing off the syndicate, soon isn't able to.

One note to the wise: the actors in supporting roles have been encouraged to trot out their country accents, and there are no subtitles.  Some may have difficulty in following the stories.

Mind you, one of the chief hallmarks of the British village detective story has always been its eccentric characters: secretive pub keepers and their adulterous regulars; priests who've left irregular doings behind them in previous postings; three-times married---and then some-- lords of the manor.  This series does not create such characters, and said characters certainly do not come back for the repeat appearances many viewers and readers love.  Nor are detectives Barnaby and Scott sharply drawn: nothing to compare with Miss Marple, or Hercule Poirot.  Or Columbo.  Or Monk.

So""Midsomer Murders"" can't be considered one of the legendary top rank of British mysteries, but it still has its pleasures.  It can deliver fun viewing of a cozy night.",1218153600,,3870,6.294117647058823
2857200,5,B000R349IY,Both my wife and enjoy this series very much.  We will soon have the whole series.  We view them often.,1212278400,,103,4.1
2857201,4,B000R349IY,"My wife and I have viewed the eight previous sets and we feel this is a very well done series.  Like anything else some we felt were very good others perhaps a little weaker.  Our only real criticism with set 9 was the fact that the murder scenes were a little more graphic than previous episodes.  And in some cases needlessly so.
Overall 4 out of 5 stars.",1208390400,,357,4.220588235294118

2857203,5,B000R349IY,We love the the Midsomer Murders with John Nettles and cast. You get a real picture of life in a small English village. The countryside is beautiful and the mysteries fun to try and solve with Barnaby and Scott.,1205452800,,211,4.435897435897436
2857204,5,B000R349IY,"Fans of British mysteries are bound to like this series.  Grisly but devoid of the gory sensationalism that pervades many U.S. crime dramas, Midsomer Murders boasts the beautiful English countryside as well as the always unflappable Inspector Barnaby.  The stories are contemporary and full of suspense.  We found them completely entertaining.",1203897600,,343,5.686274509803922
2857205,5,B000R349IY,"I bought every set Amazon has and am eagerly awaiting the current Midsommer season, which BBCA chose NOT to air in the US. The stories are well written, the acting excellent, and the settings beautiful. They rival any PBS Mystery Series in every way. Worth every penny.",1198713600,,269,4.74468085106383
2857206,5,B000R349IY,"I have all of these mysteries and have yet to be disappointed in any of them. This latest set is again very well acted, nicely plotted and if you enjoy good scenery (the British are so good at filming locations really well) there is plenty of that to enjoy as well. The characters are well developed which adds a lot to the entertainment. If you love good British mysteries, these are sure to please you. If another set is made available, I will certainly buy it!",1195344000,,463,4.395348837209302

2857208,5,B000R349IY,"For all those of you who love the setting of a quaint English country village and have grown up on a diet of Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, there is nothing to beat Midsomer. There are times that I have wished that Barnaby were more expressive, but I guess that's his claim to fame, his signature. I  own almost each and every DVD of this series and I am convinced that I would be able to watch many of the episodes again and still find something interesting within them. Highly recommended.",1194652800,,492,4.406593406593407
