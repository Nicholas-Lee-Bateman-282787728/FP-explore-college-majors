3456526,5,B001AOW6R0,"Underworld is the typical plot about wanting the the forbidden mob boss's girlfriend.  Dark Manhattan is a bit more like Shaft or Black Caesar of the 1930s.  Historically significant.  Black movies by, for and of black people.  Black people apparently wanted to live like upper middle class white people much like white guys wanted to be Frank Sinatra.  A sort of alternate universe where doctors, lawyers and cops are all black and all American.  Typical of these movies an MTV music video (well, film) pops out every once in a while.  Always a crowd pleaser.",1258675200,,560,4.831578947368421

8278423,3,B001AOW6R0,"I normally don't list comments about Amazon purchases, but I thought in this case I would.

I bought several Alpha discs lately (Harlem features and Lights Out episodes), and about half of them were actually DVD-R's. This title is one of them. Unfortunately, it was not listed on Amazon this way.

I assume that Alpha is now ""duplicating"" some of their past titles rather than going through the cost of ""replication."" Yet sadly, even some of their packages that contain DVD-R's show the traditional DVD logo.

As for the material itself, it is what you would expect from Alpha (and even has their watermark during beginning and end credits), but I love these offerings from bygone days so much, I chose to acquire this vintage item. The disc plays okay, but of course, as a DVD-R, it won't play in some machines.

(By the way, note for the record that the following Alpha titles I purchased were actual pressed, replicated DVD's: Lights Out, Vol. 6; The Girl from Chicago; Spirit of Youth/Lucky Ghost; Where's My Man To-Nite?/Mystery in Swing; Miracle in Harlem/Ten Minutes to Live; The Bronze Buckaroo/Midnight Shadow.)

Just thought you should be fully informed",1417737600,5,1163,4.913265306122449

8278426,5,B001AOW6R0,"There are only two words for ""Dark Manhattan;"" Ralph Cooper. He was such a good performer, yet so under utilized. I have about three films with him--I wish there were far more.",1361145600,,176,4.53125
8278427,2,B001AOW6R0,"I found the picture quality of both movies especially the ""Underworld"" movie to be below digital standards.  Today's technologies have made it possible for us to be able to see and hear these old movies better than the quality of video and audio I witnessed when I watched this DVD. I am actually sorry that I bought it but the movie ""Manhattan"" was the only movie worth watching because it's plot and acting were far better than the acting abilities displayed in the movie ""Underworld"".  So, in closing I would say to anyone who loves old movies that if you want to see the movie ""Manhattan"" on DVD then go ahead and buy it but watch out for the quality of the copy.",1301443200,4,667,4.414634146341464
