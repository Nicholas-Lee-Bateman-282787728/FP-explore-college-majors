1725418,4,B000068MBO,"My daughter has been afraid of ghosts, monsters, the dark, shadows, you name it since before she was two.  It has been two loooooooooong years of this.

Anyway, her older brother got really into this DVD (after getting over being terrified by it himself), which was of course way too scary for her.  But now that she is recently starting to get past these fears, she can't get enough of this video.  She giggles and laughs at parts of it.  Frankly, I think she is a still little afraid of this video, but she gets the same thrill out of watching it that people get out of watching Friday the 13th.  It's fun to be a little scared.  However, had she watched this before she was ready for it I'm sure it would have terrified her, so I think it is really all about timing and individual temperament.

By the way, I see some of the prices people are trying to sell this for and I, personally, wouldn't exactly consider it to be a $57.31 value of a movie.  Anyway, I would at least check the local library first.  There are so many children's programs geared toward the topic of scary things and they all do the same thing -- show something scary and then reveal something safe and mundane behind it. I think kids are fascinated by these types of programs in general because they help them master their fears.",1341014400,,1304,4.373443983402489
1725419,5,B000068MBO,"Frankenpooh and Spookable Pooh are both collections of short stories or videos. These are typical Winnie-the -Pooh videos. The story is fun and silly. All the characters are included in the stories. These are both a great video to watch during the Halloween season with children or if your a lover of Winnie-the-Pooh on your own. But, these stories are best when shared with a loved one. The DVD opens with a child friendly menu with verbal directions, so once it is in the player, it's easy to choose if you want one or the other or both stories. Even though the stories have a Halloween theme, the stories may reassure younger child about Halloween. Like all Winnie-the-Pooh stories, there is a life lesson and a happy ending to the rouble the characters get in the tale.",1320451200,,773,4.649635036496351
1725420,5,B000068MBO,"I read a few reviews about some young children being frightened by this DVD,so I would definitely say that the parents should gauge whether their child would be spooked or not. In our instance, there was much more humor than anything ""spooky,"" and the whole family actually enjoyed it.

 It's packed with all the Winnie the Pooh characters, yet all of them bring their own humor,silliness and playfulness, which is to be expected of Pooh and his friends. We've seen this about a dozen times, and would definitely recommend it for the younger age group. My oldest daughter is now 10 and doesn't seem to enjoy it as much anymore, but the younger kids love it.",1308009600,,657,4.655172413793103

1725422,2,B000068MBO,"When this DVD was first watched, the adults in our household thought that these Winnie the Pooh stories did a very good job introducing ghosts to the 23 1/2 month old in the house.  However, in recent days we have decided to hide this movie because it has caused the 23 1/2 month old to worry about ghosts now, even though we told her and she agrees with us verbally that ghosts are not real.  This little girl is an avid movie watcher and has an amazing concentration level when it comes to watching them.  Unfortunately she has internalized this one and now will not go to bed in her room at night alone.  And she has never had a problem going to bed before.  Parents beware of this DVD, just because it is Pooh does not mean it is totally harmless to impressionable little minds.",1032652800,20,782,4.328767123287672
1725423,4,B000068MBO,"3 and a half stars. Ok the good stuff: This has nothing really scary at all in it, so its pretty good for very young kids. Its also Pooh, so its just plain fun to watch. Tigger is hilarious! The few things I was disappointed with were the length, around 60 minutes for both programs(5 shorts in total), and the box said 70, and it should have had ""Boo to You Too"" to make it even more 'halloweenish'.
My favorite was ""Frankenpooh"", but it was only 5 minutes long! ""Things that go Piglet in the Night"" is about piglet being mistaken for a ghost, its very funny. In ""Pooh Moon"", the gang mistakes eachother for monsters (the GrabMe Gotchas!), also pretty funny. ""Knight to Remember"" had piglet imagining he is a knight and has to be brave and slay a dragon, its a cute story that kids will really enjoy! and ""Rock a Bye Pooh"" Piglet has a nightmare (not very scary) so won't fall asleep, its really sweet because Pooh, Rabbit and Tigger are really good friends and try to help Piglet get over his nightmare. Also the bonus features (a game and a fun sing along song) aren't really to do with this DVD, but with ""Boo To You Too"", which I think should have been included on the DVD to make it a complete Halloween collection.",1031788800,20,1221,4.336244541484716

1725429,4,B000068MBO,"If you have an all-region DVD player, this is available on DVD from Amazon's UK site.

Just go to the bottom of the page and click on ""United Kingdom"", then search for product code B0000CAPWE.

It is on the DVD as half of a double feature, ""Spookable Fun & Boo To You Too"".

If you don't have an all-region DVD player, get one. They do not cost any more than a regular player anymore. There are lots of good things being published in the UK that are not available here in the U.S.

1725431,5,B000068MBO,"I grew up with Winnie the Pooh and when my younger brother and sisters wanted to watch it, I of course wanted to show them on DVD. Of course, Disney is wasting money on making Hannah Montana dvd's than actually making a good DVD of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

At first, I was expecting it would be more like with Pooh's Heffalump Halloween. A dumb plot, followed by a Halloween special in the middle to make the plot move, and then end it in 10 minutes.

But it turned out to be a good DVD. First off, there are two movies on this disc. One was ""Frankenpooh,"" which included the episodes ""Frankenpooh,"" ""Things That Go Piglet in the Night,"" and ""Pooh Moon."" The other one was ""Spookable Pooh,"" including ""A Knight to Remember"" and ""Rock-a-Bye, Pooh Bear.""

There was no silly subplot story. Nothing in between. It just gives you the episodes, unedited, and uncut. My little siblings loved it! So it's great for kids! It doesn't ruin your experience with the series.

So if you're a fan of this great, nostalgic series, this DVD is a must have! It's great and doesn't disappoint anyone!",1361232000,3,1097,4.525252525252525

1725433,4,B000068MBO,My Grandson loves Winnie the Pooh.  This is a super fun video and we both enjoy it. I rated this very high mainly because it does not have that annoying girl and her dog in it as some of the newer Pooh videos have.,1350000000,,214,3.8636363636363638

7964369,4,B000068MBO,"I bought this from a third party seller as a used ""guaranteed to play"" item... but it doesn't play all of the episodes.  So... I can't give it 5 stars since I don't know all of what is on it!  I'm also not sure if it's just because it's an old DVD or if it's because of being used that it's not working.  Some older DVDs don't work very well in the newer players and I suspect this might be one of them.  However, what I've seen of it was entertaining to me... but the kids didn't like it as much as others.  I can't tell if this is because of the issues with the DVD or if it was just the type of shows that were on it.  We've watched it once and haven't been back to it.  So, unfortunately not a 5 star one for us, but I'm going to try to give it another chance with the kids later in the year and see how they feel about it again!",1483315200,,833,3.7803468208092488
7964370,5,B000068MBO,"It's October, so I find myself playing these two films over and over!  They are actually two compilations of Winnie the Pooh episodes.  I have copies of these compilations on VHS, but this two-part DVD makes it easier to go back and forth between the compilations, and skip to your favorite episodes.

Who does Tigger sleep with when he's away from home?  How can you tell Winnie the Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet, and Tigger's sleeping bags apart?  How can donkeys be parachutists?  Did you know that there are Chess pieces known as Magicians?  Can you imagine Winnie the Pooh growing too big to fit into a frame of film?  Can you guess what Halloween costumes Gofur creates and wears?  Watch these films and find out!",1477180800,,710,4.661290322580645
