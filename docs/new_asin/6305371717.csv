7888218,4,6305371717,Some think this movie is better that the original Silver Fox. I think its close but not so. Non stop high impact action from begining to end in this one though. Silver Fox's brother (which is actually Hwang Jang Lee again)is Hardcore to the tilt in this one. Almost invincible. One of the best end fighting sequences ever recorded. A must buy for the Kung fu movie collector.,1019260800,,375,4.529411764705882
7888219,3,6305371717,"Originally titled Secret Rivals II, similar cast as the first and the kungfu is probably better than the first one, but a loss of Wong Tao in this film is bad. I would have rather see them cut out John Liu. The movie is about the twin of the evil guy killed in the first movie seeking revenge against those who killed his brother.",974073600,,330,4.171875
