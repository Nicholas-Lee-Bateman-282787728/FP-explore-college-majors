Because I can, I redid the copy to make it watchable...  Good Grief!!!",1515196800,,211,4.410256410256411

8276717,5,B001AD54BG,"I mainly bought this movie because it not only had Gene Autry in it, but also Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, who had a prominent role here, and it was a little strange to hear him speak normally, and not in broken English as he does as Tonto in The Lone Ranger.  This role showcases Jay Silverheels' talent and abilities.  Clayton Moore's role is as a bad guy, and he only appears briefly in a few scenes.  Gene portrays a cowboy with a ranch who is irritated at the Indians' stealing, but then he finds out about their dire situation, and changes his attitude, and works to help them, with a big assist from Jay Silverheels.  This movie has action and compassion and is well worth watching.",1358812800,2,695,4.448818897637795

The film begins on a cattle ranch out west with the usual white-faced Hereford cattle prized for their meat. After the War Between the States there was increasing immigration to western lands opened for development (no mention of railroads). There was conflict with the natives living on these lands. The buffalo was replaced with more productive cattle. Gene Autry is told about the Indians grazing their sheep on his newly bought lands. Gene visits the chief to complain, then helps an old sick woman. We see how Martin operates his trading post. [Is he customer friendly?] The Doctor makes house calls, and diagnoses the sickness: malnutrition. Gene sings a song about an Indian boy. Does this boy love apples? Do the school children get enough to eat? [Is this still a problem today?] Gene has a new game for the school children: inoculation. Is there a limit on how much wealth or cattle someone may own? There is a fight for action. Sheep are forced off a cliff.

Smiley claims the two men were working for him to gather wool; that's why they were on the reservation. Henderson can't do anything about Martin's business dealings. Gene asks a newspaper man to write up this story as news, but is refused. We see the Capitol in Washington, Congress isn't is session. [No imperial presidency then.] The economics of the reservation are explained. No sheep, no wool for blankets to sell for money. They can't raise corn without water. No income, no credit for food. The Indians must sell their prized possessions. [Like some people sell their gold today.] That visiting buyer wants more bargains. Can a petition remove Martin from the reservation by voting him out? The old chief disappeared. When found, he was hit on the head and the necklace, his badge of authority, was stolen! Who would do this?

Martin swore out a warrant for Makona, next in line if the chief dies. Gene advises Makona to hide away. There is a chase for action. Can Gene find evidence to solve the crime? There is another chase with gunfire for more action. [This usually occurs near the end of the story.] Can they escape by hiding in the rocks? Gene fights the man circling behind them. Will help arrive to save them? Yes, the sheriff arrives to sort things out. There is a new chief now. The newspaper man writes a story about the starving Indians. [Who was looting their allotments?] The publicity brings Santa Claus to the reservation. There is a song for a happy ending. ""Let's give thanks to the Lord."" The children sing ""Silent Night"". Unlike earlier movies, Gene does not get the girl.

This story departs from the conventional western but in a nice way. Would the story and songs now be banned in the Corporate Media? Yes, but its still a good Christmas movie.",1290124800,,2785,4.712525667351129
8276719,3,B001AD54BG,"""The Cowboy and the Indians"" was one of Gene Autry's most memorable films for a number of reasons and should be included in the collection of every oldtime fan.

For starters, it's the only Gene Autry movie to feature one of his incredibly popular Christmas songs. Late in the film Gene and Champion lead a wagon full of toys down the road while Gene and cast -- including Santa Claus -- sing ""Here Comes Santa Claus.""

Moments later, Autry joins forces with a choir composed of Indian children in a stirring rendition of ""Silent Night.""

The film is significant in pointing out the serious living conditions being endured by the Indian people at the time. There were no multi-million dollar casinos in their immediate futures back then.

Autry's stellar supporting cast includes both the Lone Ranger (Clayton Moore -- playing a bad guy) and Tonto (Jay Silverheels -- playing a good guy).

Many B-Western fans won't recognize Moore's handsome face, but there is no mistaking THAT voice.

This fine Gene Autry film deserved a better fate than this poor quality DVD produced by Sinister Cinema.",1236297600,6,1092,4.875675675675676
