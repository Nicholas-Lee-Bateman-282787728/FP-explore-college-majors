Well, now you can do something about it.  Learn how to defeat the Soviet Collective by watching these genuine WWII combat training films.

This set has one short without a sound track [probably never had one] and all are without subtitles.  None of this affected my enjoyment, however.

Topics covered by these films includes esoteric subject matter such as using and troubleshooting the MG 34 and Panzerfaust.

Some films are very dark in parts, so it's hard to see what's going on; others are clearer.  I really liked learning how the Germans thought about combat tactics and how they proposed dealing with their Soviet adversaries.
What's also cool is the Germans often use real ordinance in these films, and real explosions are cool.  Actual Russian tanks, uniforms and weapons are used, so it's very informative to see the real deal in action, and sometimes blown up (If you want to see Russian tanks get blown up, get the Christmas Classic, ""Men Against Tanks"", for gourmet carnage).

If you want a HD crystal-clear, 3D cinematic experience, this may not be for you, because many of these old films have lost their luster.  If you want to watch these films for their historical and military significance, or need to brush up on your bayonet charge, this offering is a real treasure to behold.",1395878400,,1335,4.867256637168142
