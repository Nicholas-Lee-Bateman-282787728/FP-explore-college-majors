8463276,5,B005AFMGIY,"Even though not written or directed by Stephen Chow, it is a perfect vehicle for him.  It uses the legend of Beggar So as a vague point of reference, but is an original story and highly satirical.  I won't go into plot details, but it's one of those movies (seemingly frequent with Stephen Chow) where when you recognize where it is heading, your jaw drops in total amazement.

Highly recommended.  One of Stephen Chows best early efforts.  Oh yes, it also has Ng Man Tat, which is always icing on the cake.",1431043200,3,507,4.467391304347826
