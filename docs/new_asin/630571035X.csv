The match between Triple H and Cactus Jack was  a classic. It is about as hardcore as any WWF match has gotten. A  barbed-wire wrapped 2x4 and a pile of thumbtacks were just some of the  weapons used in this great match for the WWF Championship.
The other  spectacular match was between the Hardy Boyz and the Dudleys. It was a  special 'table match' in which the only way to win is to put both wresters  on the opposing team through tables!

Then the Tag Team Table Match was amazing (The Hardy's really are the best tag team in the WWF.) The the  Miss. Rumble 2000 Bikini Contest was great (except for Mae Young, uhhhh!)  The Tag Team Title match was the sleeper match. The WWF World Heavyweight  Title Match was too much for words. It was Mick Foley at his best; it had  2x4's wrapped in barbed wire, thumb tacks, everything, even a BORING chant  at one point. The actual Royal Rumble was pretty boring, but, they all are  until the last 15 minutes. We did get to see Too Cool & Rikishi dance.

1075893,3,630571035X,"Royal Rumble 2000 was very interesting. It had some great entertainment and some good matches. The true highlight was indeed the Street Fight between Triple H & Mick Foley. The street fight was one of the bests in WWE history. Pretty good Rumble as well.

1. Kurt Angle vs. Tazz
This was Tazz's ppv debut. The match wasn't really all that good but it was a good opener. It really got the crowd pumped up and it was a good way to open up the show. Good opener but the match was decent. 3/5

2. Tables Match
Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz
This match was tables gallore. There was tables left and right in this one. The Hardys even pull out a ladder in this one and it gets used briefly. It had some nice table crashes and some good counters using the tables. Jeff would jump from the top row onto D-Von onto the table to win it for the hardys. Great match. 4.5/5

  Miss Rumble Swimsuit Competition
This was a pretty funny skit here. All the women looked hottt in this one and the whole Mae Young flashing was very disturbing but it gave some good entertainment. Pretty funny and hot segment to check out.

3. Intercontinental Title
Chris Jericho vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Chyna
This match really impressed me. I'm also impressed with Chyna's athleticism and toughness to hang in there and take the same shots as the guys. There was some pretty nice suplexes and double team moves. Action also took place on the outside. Chyna even pulled off a good pedigree onto Holly. The right person won this as well. Better than expected thats for sure. 3.5/5

4. Tag Team Titles
New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes
Very short contest here. It started out as a brawl but had a such sneaky and slick end to it. It was short but the end is what made the whole match. Pretty good move especially after the previous weeks of beat downs on the Outlaws from the Acolytes which everybody thought they would win the titles. Very sweet match. 2.5/5

5. Street Fight for the WWE Championship
Cactus Jack vs. Triple H
Defiantly one of the best street fights ever and the build up to it was very good too. Hunter looked very intimidated of Foley in this one. These two just beat the holy hell out of each other and it showed. Foley would bleed from the mouth and Hunter would bleed from the head and leg. Foley and Hunter took some very hard shots and they both took some harsh punishment. Foley looked really good in this one and it had a good ending with the tacks and the two pedigrees. Very brutal contest, especially for Triple H. Match of the night for me and to be honest, I enjoyed this more than their Hell in the Cell match but thats just my opinion. 5/5

6. Royal Rumble Match
Pretty solid Rumble right here but to me it could have been better espically with who was all participating in it.

It went pretty slow at first. The King got mad when his son entered number 2 which was a little funny. It got picked up when Rikishi entered. Tanka took a hard hit the floor which it looked like it gave him a concussion. Kane had a pretty good showing and of course everybody went nuts when the Rock came out. This Rumble had a pretty predictable ending but it did felt questionable to me. Other than that pretty solid rumble but it didn't had no real moments that will be remembered. Better than average Rumble. 4/5

Good Rumble to check out but the main reason would have to be the Street Fight, it was very brutal.",1218499200,,3382,4.3438985736925515
1075894,4,630571035X,"Royal Rumble 2000

Kurt Angle VS Tazz: Like anther reviewer said it could have been a classic. The match is short and Tazz makes Angle tap. Too bad that Tazz wouldnt really do much in the rest of wrestling career in WWE.

Hardy Boyz VS Dudley Boyz in a Tables Match: Match of the night. Lots of great action and spots. The ending is amazing.

Miss Rumble 2000 Swimsuit Contest: The show started to sink when they put this on PPV. Mae Young exposing herself was shocking and disguisting. I think this lasted way too long.

Chyna VS Hardcore Holly VS Chris Jericho: Jericho was heavily favored in this match and won it. Not really a great match by any standards.

New Age Outlaws VS Acolytes: Decent match but nothing really speical. The show is really starting to drag in a boring event.

Cactus Jack VS Triple H: Everyone loves this match. I thought the first ten minutes stunk but started getting good towards the end. Hated seeing Triple H win it but it was an alright match.

Royal Rumble: Again, starting in 2000- The Rumble lost its luster. A few Rumbles had good moments but if you followed wrestling, you knew who was going win the Rumble. Still entertaning though.

The Rumble is well worth the money. They also look back on the past two Royal Rumbles and not just a quick run thru. They have the last 20 minutes (i believe) of 98 and 99 Rumble. Good extras and overall, a good Rumble.",1196726400,,1393,4.435294117647059
1075895,5,630571035X,"Royal Rumble 2000 had several memorable moments. The debut of Taz in the WWE, the first ever tag team tables match, the street fight between HHH and Cactus Jack, and the royal rumble match itself, which had some great moments all by itself...

Taz vs. Kurt Angle: This was when Angle was great as heel. Taz came out to a massive ovation and both he and Kurt put on a great show of suplexing each other back and forth but it was Taz who got the win after forcing Kut to pass out with his famous chokehold. 8/10

Tag Team Tables Match
The Dudley Boys vs. The Hardy Boys:
One of the best matches in history. This entire ppv is worth it just for this match. Some highlights include The Dudley Boys setting up a table on top of the ring steps that they brought in the ring and powerbombing Matt Hardy off the top rope through the table! Then Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy pull out a couple of ladders and put D-Von through a couple of tables. in the end the Hardy Boys win after Bubba Ray falls through three tables by the stage entrance! 10/10

Swimsuit Contest:
Ok, the divas basically come out and strut their stuff but then all insanity breaks loose as Mae Young comes out and flashes the crowd. URGH! lol.

Intercontinental Championship
Hardcore Holly vs. Chyna vs. Chris Jericho:
At the time Chyna and Jericho were co-champions of the IC title. An ok match but sometimes the wrestling seemed a little bit sloppy. Jericho gets the win and becomes the new IC champ. 7.5/10

Tag Team Championships
The New Age Outlaws (champions) vs. The APA:
Not much of a match, it lasted about 5 minutes. The crowd was into the New Age Outlaws but there wasn't anything worth remembering in this match. NAO retain their titles. 6/10

WWF Championship
Street Fight
HHH (Champion) vs. Cactus Jack:
I loved the intro to this match, it was fantastic. The match itself wasn't that bad either, lol. In truth it was one of the best matches ever put on.
Chairs, tables, handcuffs, steel steps, barbed wire, and tacks all make appearances. Highlights include HHH hitting Cactus with a chair so hard part of the chair flies off into the crowd! Cactus fights back even though he was handcuffed behind his back. HHH wins the match however after giving a pedigree to Cactus onto a pile of tacks! 10/10

Royal Rumble Match
Great rumble. Highlights include Too Cool and Rikishi dancing in the ring the Mean Street Posse making the mistake of getting on the APA's bad side, and the Rock winning the rumble after tossing out the Big Show which started their own feud. 9/10

Again, this is definately worth it just for the Tables match, but the street fight is just another great treat for this dvd, so buy it today!",1182124800,,2678,4.495884773662551
1075896,4,630571035X,"WWF returned home to Madison Square Garden & whenever they have a PPV here, they usually always deliever a memorable show & we got that here with new characters & match innovations, a classic WWF Title match, an entertaining Rumble, and either one of the funniest or sickest (depends on your view) sights you will not only see in wrestling but your entire life.

Tazz vs. Kurt Angle - Kurt Angle's undefeated streak came to an end as Tazz made his debut in Madison Square Garden and quickly deposed of Kurt Angle via his suplexes & choking Angle out.

Tables Match: Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz - This was the first tables match in WWF history.  Man, did these two put on a show here as both teams did a great showing & with the way these teams were put through those tables...it was something to see at the time.

Ms. Rumble Swimsuit Contest - I don't know if this is censored or not on the DVD but I saw it live & trust me, this was either one of the funniest or one of the sickest segments depending on your taste of humor.  Their divas at the time such as Ivory, Luna, B.B., Jacqueline, Terri, and The Kat (who was only wearing bubble wrap over her private areas) showed off what they had before Mae Young came out & showed off her puppies which had Jerry Lawler cowarding in the corner as Mark Henry tried to cover her up but it wasn't working & neither was the censored sign on the screen.  Again, one of the funniest or one of the sickest segments depending on your taste of humor.

Co-Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. Co-Intercontinental Champion Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly - These three didn't really mesh well here as Chyna was still green in what she could do in the ring and Hardcore Holly isn't much in the ring past a brawler so Jericho couldn't carry both wrestlers to a good match.  It was watchable but don't expect much.

Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes - Honestly, I think the highlight package for the match lasted longer than the match itself.  It was too quick to make note of anything.

Street Fight: WWF Champion Triple H vs. Cactus Jack -

The was the match that established HHH was a solid main eventer. Great match from both of these wrestlers as thumbtacks, handcuffs, barbwire, ect. are used here.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - This was one of the best entertaining Rumbles of all time as they were filled with plenty of moments such as Too Cool & Rikishi dancing during the Rumble, Taka's elimination from the Royal Rumble that resulted in him going to the hospital, Funaki making a record for be eliminated the most times during a Rumble match, the Mean Street Posse's ""interaction"" with the Acolytes, and the beginning of the fued between Big Show & The Rock.

This PPV only had 2 outstanding matches (with 1 of them being available on at least 4 different DVD sets) on the undercard & a very entertaining Rumble match...overall though, I recommend.",1181001600,,2903,4.515267175572519
1075897,5,630571035X,"This is perhaps the oldest event on DVD that I own, and it's one that even some five or six years after first purchasing it, I still treasure and even watch regularly.

While some matches weren't particularly astounding or fascinating, there were plenty of amazing matches, such as a very ECW-esque tag-team table match between The Dudley Boyz and The Hardy Boyz (most memorable moment: D-Von rolling off a table as Matt jumps into it, then bolts out of the way as Jeff flies out of the ring into another table set up against the audience stands), and the Street Fight between HHH and Cactus Jack (a bonus feature shows very explicit footage of a very real injury HHH sustains to his leg being sewn up as the Royal Rumble goes on).

There was a Diva swimsuit contest which, surprisingly, was entertaining, and hilarious, as Mae Young shows up, and hilarity ensues.  She wins the contest, by the way, unanimously :D

The Rumble itself was without a doubt great, and utterly thrilling.  There was plenty to be entertained with here, including Jerry Lawler's obsessiveness over watching Taka Michinoku of Kaientai (not in the Rumble) being tossed out of the ring and banging his head on the outside mat, Rikishi and Too Cool dancing after clearing out the ring, all our favorite superstars like Viscera, Big Boss Man, The New Age Outlaws, Bob Backlund, the Headbangers, Chyna, The Big Show, and most electrifying of all, The Rock, who wins (albeit controversially) after eliminating The Big Show.

As if the event weren't enough, it gives us bonus features including some clips (not 30-second clips, but like 10-15 minute clips) of the 1998 and 1999 Royal Rumbles, and footage post-Rumble of the controversy over The Rock's victory over Big Show.

One of the best Royal Rumbles I've ever seen.  A definite buy (if it weren't out of print :()",1174780800,,1838,4.794303797468355
1075898,3,630571035X,"All in all, the 2000 version of the Royal Rumble was a disappointing event. It features a weak under card, a strong main event and a mediocre Royal Rumble match.

Tazz vs. Kurt Angle

This match was only about three minutes long, so it cant fairly be considered a wrestling match. This was Tazz's WWE debut, but otherwise there is no reason to watch this match.

The Hardy Boys vs. The Dudley Boyz (Tables Match)

This is the best match by far of the under card. The Hardy Boys always put on a good match and the Dudleys are fun to watch when tables come into play. This match is no different than any other tables match, however. All the same, it stands out compared to the rest of the under card.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho versus Intercontinental Champion Chyna versus Bob Holly

This match was somewhat entertaining to watch. Jericho and Holly can put on good matches and Chyna can at least keep up. But it was short and the flow of the match was very obvious. To clarify, Jericho and Chyna were co-champions coming into this match.

World Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws versus The Acolytes

Like the opening match, this one was only about three minutes and there really is not much to say about it. It could have been a lot better if given another ten minutes or so.

WWF Champion Triple H versus Cactus Jack (Street Fight)

The main event was easily the best match on the card. Both Triple H and Mick Foley can put on good matches, and Foley is in his element in this sort of match. It was given plenty of time and both guys worked really hard and put together an excellent match.

2000 Royal Rumble

The 2000 Royal Rumble was one of the most boring Rumble matches to date and also one of the most predictable. There were a lot of mid-card and low-card wrestlers in this one and really was not very exciting at all.

It is very hard to justify buying this pay per view. It featured one great match, one good match and the rest was junk. By far, one of the worst Royal Rumble pay per views to date.",1139529600,,2025,4.3537234042553195
1075899,5,630571035X,"This Royal Rumble was excellent. It wasn't the best,but it is definitely a great pay-per-view.

1. Tazz vs. Kurt Angle
These two superstars were new to the WWF at this time. This was Tazz's debut and Kurt Angle debuted two months earlier. There were a lot of suplexes in the match and it was a pretty good opener. It wasn't very long so its worth a view,but there are much better matches to be seen here. 6 out of 10.

2. Tables Match
Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz
This was a first for the WWF and it didn't disappoint. This was a physically intense match and there were some sick moves performed in the match. The Madison Square Garden crowd was really into this one which also helped the match. 10 out of 10.

I won't even comment on the Miss Rumble contest because it was the most hideous thing I have ever seen.

3. Triple Threat Match
Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly(WWF Intercontinental Championship)
This was a good Triple Threat match,but not the best. I have no clue as to why Hardcore Holly was in the match in the first place because the rivalry was between Chyna and Jericho. Maybe he had nothing else to do. 7 out of 10.

4. New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes(WWF Tag Team Championship)
This match did its job which was to calm the crowd down until the Street Fight. It was about 3 minutes and it really wasn't to bad in those 3 minutes. 6 out of 10.

5. Street Fight
Cactus Jack vs. Triple H(WWF Championship)
This match was just absolutely sick. I 've never seen their No Way Out match so I can't say which one was better. They used so many weapons:thumbtacks,bricks,wooden pallats,handcuffs,barbed wire 2X4,announcers table,you name it. Cactus even got pedigreed on the thumbtacks:OUCH!10 out of 10.

6. Royal Rumble Match(Winner gets title shot at Wrestlemania)
This was a great Royal Rumble match, mainly because of its funniness factor. From Too Cool dancing to Kai-en-Tai repeatedly coming into the match even though they weren't in it,there is enough funny for everyone. The match wasn't half bad neither. 9 out of 10.",1138406400,2,2041,4.59065934065934
1075900,4,630571035X,"Any WWF fan in attendance for this PPV will likely never forget it.  Innovation was the name of the game at ""Royal Rumble 2000"", and while a couple of spots didn't deliver all the way, this PPV never lacked originality.

1) Kurt Angle vs. Tazz

---Tazz just left ECW to pursue a career in the WWF.  Kurt Angle was also on a 2-month undefeated streak.  This match could've been a technical classic.  The fairly green Kurt Angle isn't to blame here.  The WWF thought that the best way to introduce the Red Hook hardcore technician would be to hand Angle's ass to him on a silver platter.  Don't get me wrong, the suplexes and maneuvers are very good, but this match was just too short to fully appreciate.

""6 out of 10""

2) Table Match

The Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz

---This was a first-ever for the WWF, and strangely enough, it was the best Table Match until ""Survivor Series 2002"".  The Hardyz had just earned their landmark reputation after the classic Ladder Match against Edge/Christian at ""No Mercy 1999"", and don't disappoint here (they rarely did, those two).  The match is vicious, and plays off of the Table stipulations very well.  I don't think Jeff Hardy's famous entryway Swanton Bomb is that great, but the crowd was excited, and I can accept that I was one of the few that thought the finish was merely solid.

""9 out of 10""

3) Miss Rumble 2000 Swimsuit Contest

---This segment takes enough time to merit a grade.  These beautiful women just show off theit outfits, basically.  I don't think many realize how beautiful Luna Vachon is without the makeup, but whatever.  The Kat's creative bubble-wrap bikini isn't that hot, I don't think, but everyone's got their thing.  Mae Young, simply put, is the most disgusting image you will ever see.  The CENSORED bar doesn't even cover everything up.  I don't know what the WWF was thinking, but they get credit for shocking us all on a new level.

""7 out of 10"" (Mae Young's sickening stunt was ORIGINAL)

4) Intercontinental Championship

Hardcore Holly vs. Chyna (co-champion) vs. Chris Jericho (co-champion)

---After their pitiful build-up, Chyna and Jericho had some repair work to do with their careers.  They would go on to salvage this dreck of a storyline, but this match is merely okay.  It's a little too uninteresting and has that under-card feel that just kills some potential matches.  I've always liked Hardcore Holly, but he just doesn't have much to work with here.  This triple threat contest isn't required viewing, but again, co-champions was an original concept.

""6 out of 10""

5) Tag Team Championships

The New Age Outlaws (champions) vs. The Acolytes

---If you think that the Tazz/Angle opener was disappointing, then get ready for this 3-minute suckerpunch.  This match is fast-paced and hard-hitting, not to mention had the hype to sell the cowardly Road Dogg and Mr. Ass trying to evade the dominant Bradshaw and Faarooq.  Why did this only last 3 minutes?  Unbelievable; you'll like what you see, but's over far too soon.

""6 out of 10""

6) Street Fight for the WWF Championship

Cactus Jack vs. Triple H (champion)

---This is one of the 5 greatest matches ever performed from any wrestling organization.  Chairs, thumbtacks, wooden palates, tables, barbed-wire bats, handcuffs, brick walls, steel steps...IT'S ALL HERE!  When Triple H gives Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley a farewell kiss, you know that this match is going to get nasty!  I think The Rock's brief interference is a little odd, but it opens up the door for more sadistic carnage!  I love this match, which made the Best of 2000 VHS!  On a side note, Triple H has a DVD extra on here showing the grisly aftermath of what he put his body through.  This man has earned his ass-kissing benefits with hard work like this.

""10 out of 10""

7) 3-Man Royal Rumble

---Quick thought, why the brief flashback to Shawn Michaels' victory at the 1995 Royal Rumble?  Maybe this was an ongoing promotion that ended tonight.  Anyway, this Royal Rumble has an interesting roster.  We get the superstars like Big Show, Kane, Mr. Ass, and The Rock.  We know that X-Pac is going to enter #30, so he isn't gonna win (the 30th person never has)!  Also, Kaientai and The Mean Street Posse cause trouble when they're not even fighting this match.  I like the lineup here, but this match just feels claustrophobic.  It sounds weird, but the crammed setting of the Madison Square Garden arena just seems to hurt this match.  Also, it moves too slowly.  The 1995 and 1997 Royal Rumble matches taught us that the ring didn't always need to pile up, and that we could have a fast-paced Royal Rumble.  This one moves too slowly and has too much pileup.  Also, The Rock's victory comes from a mile away.  I'm sorry, but Big Show at ""WrestleMania"" was not a believeable idea.  Then again, he did main event for 7 minutes.  Regardless, this Royal Rumble main event is okay, but nothing great.

""7 out of 10""

The extras on the DVD are pretty good.  We get the concluding moments of the 1998 and 1999 Royal Rumble matches.  Triple H headlines the aforementioned Street Fight Aftermath.  And, there are storyline flashbacks for a few matches.  Overall, a pretty good DVD.",1138147200,6,5197,4.727374301675978

Tazz vs. Kurt Angle

This was Tazz first WWE match and his WWE debut. Kurt Angle was never lost in a one-on-one matches. This match has lots of suplexes and submission moves. But suddenly, this match is short.

Winner: I'm not sure who the winner is but i think the winner is Tazz cause he chokes out Kurt Angle!

Rating: 8/10

Double Tables Tag Team Match

The Dudleys vs. The Hardys

The match is so great that i couldn't believe the moves and high-flying actions. This match also have a less brutal action. The hardys and dudleys are so impressive in the match. This was dudleys game.

Winner: The Hardys

Rating: 9.5/10

Miss Rumble 2000 Contest

I didn't like this match cause it sucks and the ladies are not hot like the ones today. Also, i didn't like legendary ladies cause also it sucks. This is a nasty stuff. Not for PPV.

Winner: Mae Young

Rating: 1/10

Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental Championship

Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly

An average match also with lots of action but how Hardcore Holly get in the match? I'm not expecting that Hardcore Holly is in the match. Keep in mind that there are two champions, Chris Jericho & Chyna.

Winner: Chris Jericho

Rating: 7/10

World Tag Team Championships

New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes

A dumb match with less entertainment and action, just amateur and lots of submission moves. Also, this match is way toooo short!!!

Winner: New Age Outlaws

Rating: 3.5/10

Streetfight for the WWF Championship

Triple H vs. Cactus Jack

Wow What a great match. This maybe the greatest street fight in my life i've ever seen!!! This match has lots of blood, brutal & hardcore like and ECW like action. The match has lots of weapons come into play like a 2x4 barbwire, a steel chair, a steel steps, thumbtacks, trash can, tables & even handcuffs. The Rock has a less interference smacking Triple H with a steel chair.

Winner: Triple H

Triple H (c) vs. Cactus Jack - GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best match of both mens careers, too many spots to mention (best Cactus getting Pedigreed on thumbtacks!!!).

ROYAL RUMBLE 2000:
Taz vs. Kurt Angle: 7.5/10
Taz's debut in the WWE and while it was a good match, it could have been better. The match was very short however it was great for the time it lasted and the crowd were really into it.

Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz: 10/10
One couldn't ask for more from a table match. This is the best table match I have ever seen and certainly one of the greatest matches in these 4 men's careers. Sheer brilliance.

Diva Swimsuit Competition: 3/10
I wish they would have put in another match here instead of this. The moments with May Young were pretty funny and that's the only reason this gets a 3.

Intercontinental championship:
Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly: 7.5/10
Not a bad match. This certainly kept the viewer excited. I didn't expect a lot from this match so I was pleased.

Tag team championship:
New Age Outlaws vs. The Acolytes: 6/10
Standard tag team match, nothing great about it.

WWF championship:
HHH vs. Cactus Jack: 10/10
The only word to describe this street fight is perfect. The best match of Triple H's career and one of the best of Mick's career. So many great hardcore spots, everything was done perfectly and I guarantee that you will be at the edge of your seat the whole way through this one.

The Royal Rumble: 8/10
I love royal rumble matches, it is rare that I rate a rumble match below 8.5 or even 9, however this one was not the greatest. This one seemed to be full of jobbers the whole way through. No real exciting spots either. Well not to worry, it is still entertaining as all rumbles are.

SCORE: 52/70 (74/100)
According to the key I have rated this PPV as 'Great, a first-rate PPV and it is certainly worth your money'. I agree with this fully. This PPV have 2 out standing matches and that's not even including the rumble match. It's too bad a boring divas competition gave this a lower rating than it deserves however I highly recommend that you buy this.",1118880000,2,2787,4.204119850187266

92-100 EXCELLENT PPV

Kurt Angle vs Tazz- A lot of suplexs in this match. It was acutually a good match. Kurt Angle was undeafeted up until this match. Tazz knocks him out with the Tazzmission. Match Rating 7

Hardyz vs Dudleys Tag team table match- Awesome match. There were so many high risks. Jeff does a front flip sucide dive through a table with no one home. Then they do there leg drop cross body off ladders onto D-von through a table. Then they set up 4 tables high. Then, Jeff and Bubba are on the balcony. Jeff hits him with a chair he falls through the tables, but it has to be an offensive move so Matt set him on a table that didn't break and does a swaton off the balcony. Hardys win. Match Rating 9.5

Triple threat for the IC title Jericho vs Chyna vs Hardcore Holly- Great triple threat. Jericho dominates most of the match. Jericho and Chyna acutually work well together. There survivor series match was good and this one was also good. Jericho becomes the full Intercontinetal Champion. Match Rating 8

Tag Team Championship APA vs New Age Outlaws- Very Short match. I thought it would be better but, I also didn't expect to much out of this one after we saw a awesome tag match earlier in the night. New Age Outlaws retain because of X-Pac. Match Rating 5

Street Fight for the WWE Championship Cactus Jack vs HHH- Awesome street fight. The WWE knows how to put on Street Fights. Trips gets his leg cut on the wooden pallet. Then Foley gets a back suplex on a garbage can. This match is great. Then they use an annouce table cactus tries to piledrive HHH but then a back drop. Then, HHH tries to do it but, then Foley back drops him. Then they get the thumbtacks. Trips pedigrees him on it. HHH wins. Match Rating 10

1076161,4,630571035X,"This Pay Per View will forever be one of my favourites. It was the best time for the company with some of the best superstars and factions existing simultaneously. D-Generation X definitely made an impact on the Pay Per View, appearing in the rumble and enlisting the help of the Mean Street Posse which definitely ruined the APA's chances in their tag team bout and their presence in the Royal Rumble.

The most shocking moment was surprisingly the most humourous, with veteran Women's champion Mae Young doing the unthinkable, stripping off to the the crowd, an incident which even the censors had difficulty covering up.

The WWE Championship match between Cactus Jack and Triple H was definitely a personal encounter. The incidents leading up to this month's Pay Per View definitely had the audience excited about the prospect alone of Mick Foley facing Triple H in a street fight. The match presented alot of elements from past matches but were all incorporated nicely into the hour long bout. I didn't care that Triple H won the match, I wanted to see him punished and thats what we all got to see that night.

The Rumble didn't feel spectacular in its presentation, particularly with the set up at ring side, the whole wrestling environment felt very cramped and confined, with very little of a walkway to the ring. Therefore, the most exciting aspect of the Rumble, providing the 20 second entrances were cut short detracting from the surprise factor of the match. Nevertheless, when it came to the final encounter between Big Show and The Rock, my heart was pounding. However, we were rooting for the Rock to win so badly that we thought nothing of the contraversy afterwards. The Rock versus Triple H would have made a fine main event for Wrestlemania 16. However, I suppose having Big Show and Mick Foley in the mix added a little more excitement to the match.",1110931200,,1871,4.786377708978328

Hardy Boyz vs Dudley Boyz

Awesome match with a lot of chairshots and high-flying manuvers by the Hardys. Man, the good ol' Jeff Hardy days.

Terri looked GREAT and Mae Young delivers a DISGUSTING, but memorable moment.

Intercontinental Title Triple Threat Match 4/5

Chris Jericho vs Chyna vs Hardcore Holly

A Good Match with great crowd reactions to Y2J.

Tag Team Title Match 3.5/5

New Age Outlaws vs Acolytes

Short match that saw the Acolytes dominating until X-pac helped Mr. Ass and Road Dogg steal a victory.

WWF Title Match-Street Fight 5/5

Cactus Jack vs Triple H

AMAZING!! BRUTAL!! CLASSIC!!

HHH and Foley stole the show with a match that saw both men beat the crap out of each other. Sick ending with HHH delivering a pedigree to Cactus on top of a bunch of thumbtacks!

Royal Rumble Match 4/5

Tazz vs. Kurt Angle was good because Kurt Angle finally lost a match.  Tazz won when he choked out Kurt and this was a pretty good match. (3.5/5)

Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz in a Tables Match.  This was the first ever tables match and of course it delivered.  The Hardy Boyz pick up the win over the Dudleyz in their own game. (5/5)

Miss Royal Rumble 2000 was just sick and I nearly threw up when Mae Young won this thing and unless you like older women don't watch this.  (0/5)

Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly for the IC Title.  This was a great match but th reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of Hardcore Holly.  Why do you put a guy in the middle of a fued.  Y2J is the Undisputed Intercontinental Champion. (4.5/5)

New Age Outlaws vs. The Acolytes for the World Tag Titles.  This was a quick match, it was only 5 minutes long.  There is no way that the Outlaws can beat the Acolytes so X-Pac helps them. (2.5/5)

Triple H vs. Cactus Jack for the World Title.  This was a great match but the only thing I don't like is when Cactus does the Piledriver but the Table doesn't break but it was supposed too.  HHH retains when he Pedigreed Cactus onto the thumbtacks. (4.5/5)

Royal Rumble Match was very predictable and not that many big names.  I only new so many guys.  I thought X-Pac was gonna win when he threw Kane over but the second he turns around he gets eliminated.  The Rock wins when he tripped the Big Show over. (3/5)

1. TAZZ VS. KURT ANGLE
THIS WAS TAZZ' FIRST WWE MATCH. TAZZ IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRESTLERS OF ALL TIME. AND IT'S COOL TO SEE HIM GET THIS VICTORY OVER KURT ANGLE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, TIME HAS BEEN UNFAIR TO THESE GUYS. ANGLE WENT ON TO WIN SEVERAL WWE TITLES [HIS FIRST REIGN AS WWE CHAMPION HAPPENED LATER IN 2000] WHILE TAZZ DESCENDED INTO A MID-CARDER AND EVENTUALLY, A FULL-TIME SMACKDOWN COMMENTATOR.

4. TRIPLE THREAT MATCH FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP
CHRIS JERICHO VS. CHYNA VS. HARDCORE HOLLY
BEING THAT JERICHO AND CHYNA PINNED EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME IN AN I-C TITLE MATCH ON AN EPISODE OF RAW, THE TWO BECAME THE 1ST EVER CO-INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONS. THIS MATCH WAS HELD TO DECIDE WHO WAS GONNA BE THE UNDISPUTED I-C CHAMPION. A GOOD MATCH WITH PLENTY OF REVERSALS. RATING; 4.5/5

CHAMPIONS THE NEW AGE OUTLAWS [BILLY GUNN & ROAD DOGG] VS. THE ACOLYTES [BRADSHAW & FAAROOQ]
MATCH WASN'T LONG ENOUGH AND IT ENDED TOO EASILY. RATING; 2.5/5

6. STREET FIGHT FOR THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
CHAMPION TRIPLE H VS. CACTUS JACK
A CLASSIC MATCH. REAL VIOLENT AND REAL BLOODY, THIS HAS GOT TO BE A DEFINING CAREER MOMENT FOR BOTH OF THESE GUYS. THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF ECW USED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE IN BUSINESS. DEFINITELY NOT YOUR ORDINARY WWE MATCH! WATCH FOR THE THRILLING FINALE WHEN TRIPLE H PEDIGREES CACTUS JACK AKA MICK FOLEY ONTO A BUNCH OF THUMB TACKS! THIS IS, WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THE GREATEST MATCH ON THIS EVENT. RATING; A WELL EARNED 5/5

7. THE 30-MAN ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE RULES TO THIS MATCH. 30 MEN ENTER, BUT ONLY 1 WALKS OUT. AND THE WINNER GETS A WORLD TITLE SHOT AT WRESTLEMANIA. USUALLY, THIS IS A FUN AND EXCITING MATCH. BUT, THIS RUMBLE IS DOWNRIGHT BORING. THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN A GREAT RUMBLE MATCH SINCE THE 1998 ROYAL RUMBLE. RATING; 2/5

1st match- Tazz vs. Kurt angle

good match, lots of suplexes.  kind of short though.  Tazz choked him out in a controversal choke, handing kurt his first loss of his career.  i give it 7/10 stars.

2nd match- first ever tag team table match.  Hardy's vs. Dudley's

awsome table match.  bubba falls off the taxi above the entrance onto 2 or 3 tables, then jeff does the senton bomb off the taxi onto D-von(I think) to win the match.  i forgot how the others went through, but it was a great match.  10/10

3rd match- Mrs. Rumble Swimsuit competition.

not really a match but very nice for any male, except for when mae young comes out.  when she does look away, fast forward, skip the chapter, just don't watch, unless your into older women.  i won't tell you what happens but you don't want to know.  i give it 3.5/10 cause of mae.  oh yeah, mae wins too

4th match- triple threat intercontinental title.  Chris Jericho vs. Chyna(co-champs) vs. hardcore holly

not a bad match, but i didn't find too exciting.  jericho becomes the undisputed intercontinental champion.  i give it 7/10

5th match- Tag team championship match.  Acolytes vs. new age outlaws

same as fourth match, except X-Pac helps outlaws retain. 6/10

6th match-  Street fight for WWF title  HHH vs. Cactus Jack

awsome awsome awsome match.  I loved it.  cactus brought in his famolus weapons, like the 2x4 wraped in barbed wire, which was used by both men.  also the tacks, but HHH backdrops cactus then later pedigrees him on them to retain.  but other than that it was great.  HHH brought handcuffs in, which were used last year by the rock.  HHH was in control from there until the rock came and hit him with a chair, and had a cop uncuff cactus.  after the match cactus went to get HHH from the stretcher, brought him back to the ring and hit him with the 2X4 wrapped in barbed wire.

7th match- Royal Rumble

early in the Rumble rikishi and Too Cool started dancing only when rikishi then eliminated them both.  after that it was kind of in rikishi's favor until 6 men eliminated him, including bob backland(sp?).  The Rock came out as a marked man, and everybody went after him.  The final four were The Rock, The Big Show, Kane, and #30, X-Pac.  X-Pac did get eliminated but the refs were busy with a fight that had broken out outside the ring, so he got back in to be eliminated by big show i think.  it came down to the big show and the rock.  as Show was about to eliminate the rock, rock pulled the bottom ropes down to eliminate show and win.  after the rumble show came back down and attacked the rock.  all in all a pretty good rumble.  i give it 8.5/10

As for the entire rumble itself i give it 4.5 out of 5 or 9/10",1091836800,,2725,4.3667334669338675

The Tazz vs Kurt Angle match was a nice start for everything.  Both the Hardyz vs Dudleyz match and the Cactus Jack vs Triple H matches have to be seen to be believed.  Those two were worth the price of the DVD alone.  Plus, the Royal Rumble match itself was, as always, entertaining.  On top of that, Chris Jericho made his match fun to watch as well (as he usually does).

All I got to say was God was with HHH and Catcus Jack and gave them all the talent any man could have in one match. I see what Catcus Jack was trying to do in his match against Triple H trying to show the whole world what he meant when he wanted to wrestle in a hardcore match. This is one of the most brutal wwf title matches you will ever see in your entire life but I still don't know what match is better this match or Mankind vs Shawn Michaels at Mind Games. They did so many brutal moves in one match that it take wrestles a year to do. In other words this was the highlight match of the year and this was certainly better than any tlc match you so call fans voted for. All the brutal moves you have to see to believe,you could watch this match during halloween that is how scary this match was because they nearly killed each other, I am going to called this the Friday the 13th match. This match will even give grown-ups nightmare, so I advice you to not watch this match alone because you will call the cops for nothing and proably get a arrested.

1076244,5,630571035X,"I have been a WWE fan for many years, and I have seen many Royal Rumble shows. When I think back on all the Royal Rumbles I have seen, the 2000 show is definately one of the best. The street fight between Triple H and Cactus Jack was suspenseful, entertaining, and just flat out brutal. Triple H has put on many great matches, but this was the best match he ever produced in my opinion. Cactus Jack was just as good. I have seen a lot of Mic Foley matches, but this is the best performance he put on since being Mankind at the 1998 King of the Ring when he faced Undertaker in the ""Hell in a Cell"" match. The Royal Rumble match itself was done extremely well. It was exciting from beginning to end, and I loved the controversial ending. The 2000 Royal Rumble also marked the WWE debut of Tazz. He appeared to face Kurt Angle. While the match was kind of short, it featured a bunch of cool suplexes from Tazz, and Angle was great too. The last stand out match of the show would have to be the first ever tag team table match between the Dudley Boyz and the Hardy Boyz. They both went all out and did not hold back when it came to the bumps they took.
If you are a WWE fan, then you definately need to pick up the 2000 Royal Rumble. The amazing street fight between Triple H and Cactus Jack, the great Royal Rumble match, and a well rounded card make it a must own.

This was a fairly good opener, and it was Tazz's debuet. The ending was weird, but overall it was ok. 6/10
Table Match Hardys V Dudleys
This match was fantastic. A ladder and quite a few chairs come into play as well as a lot of broken tables! It's high flying and hardcore, with some amazing moves. One of the best matches I've seen as the action never slowed. 10/10

This match was way too short and the end is unfair as X-Pac comes in. The action was ok though. 5/10

This was an amazing match, even better than the table match from earlier. It's very brutal with lots of weapons including Barbed Wire 2x4, Chairs, Handcuffs, Tacks and bricks! There's plenty of bllod and it's pretty sick. One of my best matches ever. 10/10

Only 2 people really had a winning chance in this, Big Show and The Rock. They were the last 2 in the ring - far too predictable! It was still ok though. 7/10

1076247,5,630571035X,"WWF/WWE Royal Rumble 1992 & 2002 are my two favorites but this one rates up there if not surpasses those two!
Kurt Angle Vs. TAZZ - This was TAZZ' debut in WWF after leaving the now defunct ECW and what a debut it was. Kurt Angle pretty much is taken by surprise from the get go and never really recovers. A short but good match.
The Hardy Boyz Vs. The Dudley Boyz (Tag Team Table Match) - The first of several type matches and a prelude of what was to come in the next two years. These four men not only used tables but used ladders and chairs as well! Several high spots in this match in which the Dudleyz first made a mark in the WWF.
Swimsuit Contest - Was hot until Mae Young screwed it up! Just skip this.
New Age Outlaws Vs. Acolytes (WWF Tag Team Championship) - This one was also kept mercifully short and sweet. Still had two good spots especially when Bradshaw hits Billy Gunn with his ""clothesline from hell.""
Chyna Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Bob ""Hardcore"" Holly (Triple Threat I-C title match) - This one wasn't that exciting but had its moments.
Cactus Jack Vs. HHH - Street Fight for the WWF Championship: NOW THIS IS HOW YOU DO A HARDCORE MATCH! Very violent and very bloody! I am amazed either man walked away from this one! This is definitely a 5 star match!
30 WWF Royal Rumble Match - Very good pacing. Had some fast and slow spots but it is paced really well. Good watching.

1076248,3,630571035X,"... one of those things is the streetfight for the WWF Championship between Cactus Jack and Triple H. Without a doubt, this match was the greatest WWF title match ever(until Benoit vs. Angle in 2003, at yet another Royal Rumble.) To my recollection, this is the best match that Triple H ever wrestled and the best match that Mick Foley had in the WWF, just slightly better than vs. Shawn Michaels, Mind Games 1996. In this match, Cactus gets turned into a litteral pin cussion, Triple H loses and ungodly ammount of blood, and the People's Champ makes a cameo appearance(which, no offense to the greatest entertainer in the history of the business, provided the only sour note.) If you already own this match on either DVD or VHS and you think that you've seen the whole match already and know all there is to know, well, you don't. To get the full story, you have to see the match with commentary in the DVD extras in Triple H: The Game. Little did I know, but Triple H has a hole punctured into his leg. Yeah. Makes you squirm, huh? There is a decent match with Dudleys vs. Hardys, in a Table match.

1076399,5,630571035X,"Royal Rumble 2000 saw the classic Street Fight match between HHH and Cactus Jack. Easily, one of the best matches for either wrestler (of course not topping any of Foley's Hell in the Cell match ups).
Also the Tag Team Table Match between Matt and Jeff, the Hardy Boyz and Bubba Ray and D-Von, the Dudley Boys. Again another classic tag team match between 2 soon to be legendary tag teams. This match would eventually become one of the reasons for the ever so dangerous, TLC match (Tables, Ladders and Chairs).
And of course one of the most controversial Royal Rumbles ever. Who went over first??? I won't tell you who the finalists were but I assure you, this is a Rumble that you didn't want to miss. Especially when Japanese high flyer Taka Michinoku hits his face on the ground and Jerry the King Lawler plays it over and over again. It's pretty funny.
Also, this was Tazz's first WWF(E) appearance as he takes on Kurt Angle. And let's not forget the 3-way match for Intercontinental gold betweem Chyna, Chris Jericho and Hardcore Holly.

The undercard was really good, Dudleys/Hardy table match stole the show...Triple H/Cactus Jack and Tazz/Angle were awesome.  The crowd EXPLODED when Tazz was announced as the mystery apponent for Kurt Angle.  But the Rumble itself was very lackluster.  Again, crowds were DEAD with the exception of a few moments (Rikisk/Too Cool, and of corse The Rock's entrence).  If it wasn't for Rikishi spot, and Taka landing on his face and the half dozen replays of it, I would never watch this one again.  And the entrence ramp...horrible!!!

For the first five months of 2000 that all changed.  Vince Russo left and the storylines started to make sense.  Gratuitous sex and violence was toned down (with the exception of this show) and storylines started setting up matches instead of the other way around.
Onward.
Kurt Angle vs. Mystery Opponent - SPOILER: [This person] dominates then rookie Angle.  Funny how that would change. **3/4.  Even the squashes were good.
Hardyz vs. Dudleyz (Table Match) - Hardyz were rapidly becoming the most over team in the WWF.  Dudleyz needed legitimacy.  This match was very transitional as we went from the Acolytes and the Outlaws to the Dudleyz and Hardyz.  Edge and Christian would come later.  These guys nearly kill each other with mind-blowing spots.  Great match to get both teams respect. ***3/4
Swimsuit competition.  Trust me, fast-forward and look away from the screen.
Tag Titles - New Age Outlaws vs. Acolytes - Okay, look back.  Blink and you'll miss this match.  They must have run long. DUD
Triple-Threat Intercontinental Match - Chyna vs. Jericho vs. Holly - Chyna and Jericho were ridiculously co-champions at this point.  Holly hated everyone.  There you go.  Decent enough as Holly and Jericho carry the bulk of the match and let Chyna do a few moves along the way.  ***
Street Fight for WWF Title - Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - H beat Mankind within an inch of his life causing him to turn back into Cactus Jack.  Watching this live I had no idea who would win.  That's pretty rare.  Foley had let it be known he was retiring soon and Triple H was having credibility problems as champion.  With this brutal match Triple H was the most over heel since Ric Flair in 1992 and Foley cemented his place in history as a hardcore icon.  Tacks, barbed wire boards, chairs all get used here. ***** Not for the weak of heart. Bonus footage has Triple H backstage getting a chunk of wood removed from his calf.  It's pretty sick.
Royal Rumble - They could have just handed it to The Rock, as there was no one even close to his popularity at that point.  Everyone keeps things going very nicely until The People's Champion arrives though.  Highlights include Too Cool and Rikishi dancing in the middle of the Rumble and Kai En Tai repeatedly running in.  ****1/4

Then the 1st classic match of the night was the hardyz vs dudlyz. 1 word for this 1: unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!
These guys put a hell of a show , and it really shows what the dudlyz n hardyz can do and how far they will go to entertain a crowd, with swanton off a balcony of madison square garden. If u enjoyz people crashing through tables order this now as it has plenty of it and no other table match  has never topped this 1 and never will!
Then came the pupies (YUK)
the triple threat match was ok..your average triple threat match, was nothing special!
The tag match was ok with billy gunn selling 1 of the biggest clotheslines ive ever seen honestly he turned upside down with this one! Though it was short  which was good as it gave more time for 1 of the greatest matches of all time, in my view the match of the yr and match of the decade candidate!!!! HHH vs CACTUS JACK  in a street fight. HHH proved to u how far he wil go he ended up bloody very bloody, his face was just red(no joke), and his leg had a huge hole  from the wooden pallets  where cactus splexed him.....this is not for the weaker heart as thumbtacks come into use and you are going to have to see what happens after that  for your self!!!! It was truly amazing!
And there is still more acton!!! the 30men royal rumble!!!!
iIt was ok, it was an average rumble with  neat ending. During the rumble you will see gangrel throwing taka out of the rng n you should see how taka lands!!!OUCH!!!! he discolated his shoulda and had to goto hospital!!!!

Matches: 1. Kurt Angle Vs. Tazz - A great match but ridiculously short. Kurt Angle was undefeated until Taz came out to challenge him. The only reason for the low rating is it's only 3 min long, but what's there is great as Taz gets all his sulpexes in! Imagine if they had given these guys 10-15min!  **/5 stars
2. The Hardy Boys Vs. the Dudleys - Tag-team Table match - Wow!  One of the most underrated matches of all time. The object of the match is too get both opponents through a table. All 4 guys kill themselves in this match. Crazy spots and headshots galore as the Dudleys bring ECW to the WWF. A Crazy finish by Jeff Hardy and Buh-Buh.  *****
3. Miss Rumble Swimsuit Competition. Not a match but pretty fun to watch once if your a guy. But as soon as Mae Young comes out *IMMEDIATLY* change the chapter unless you want to see a clip from ""Something About Mary"" :-)
4. Chris Jericho Vs. Chyna Vs. Hardcore Holly - IC title - This is a rare match for me beacause Chyna is in it and I don't hate it. Jericho + Holly have great Chemistry in this match. Chyna doesn't do anything spectacular but doesn't screw up anything either. Some funny 3-way moves in this match too.  ***
5. New Age Outlaws Vs. The Acolytes - Tag Team Championship - Bah, what a let-down. Started out great, until it ended 30 seconds later! Still it's fun to hear The Road Dogg's opening promo and Billy Gun sells a vicous clothesline!  *
6. Triple-H Vs. Cactus Jack - WWF Championship Street Fight - Definitely My favorite match of 2000. Cactus Jack returns and challenges Triple-H to a anything goes Street Fight. Jack brings Madison Square Garden a toned-down version of his former IWA matches with thumb tacks, barbwire bats, broken chairs, broken tables and probably broken bones occuring. Not many people can keep up with Mic Foley but Triple-H show's you why he's ""The Game"". Foley takes his obligatory beatings and bumps but Triple-H surprises me as he took an unbelievable beating and was busted wide-open. This is the match that made Triple-H a genuine wrestling Superstar in my eyes.  *****
7. Royal Rumble 2000 - It's hard to review a Royal Rumble match. The Winner takes on the World Champion at Wrestlemania. All Royal Rumble are fun to watch though and it includes old schoolers Davey Boy Smith and Bob Backlund. Highlights included Kaientai continously invading the Rumble and one of the Mean Street Posse members getting caught up during a run-in (look for it :-) A Contravertal finish at the end.  ***1/2
Extra's on DVD: Alternate Spanish track which is fun to listen to! Another great bonus is the footage of the 1998 and 1999 Rumbles, it shows the last 10 minutes from 99 including Vader and the Honkey Tonk Man. The last 6 minutes of 1999 are shown along with the Hilarious Vince McMahon work-out sketches! Also shows Triple-H being stitched up after the Street Fight and various retrospects off some of the matches.

The Road-dog takes the cake as the most laziest wrestler of all as he literally lays down for around 23 minutes curled up in the corner, the only real high point is when Taka Mishinoku gets thrown over and land on his head, nice shot.

2. Hardyz VS Dudleys, Table match: The 1st ever tag team table match in the WWF made me cringe with some of the hi-flying, hard hitting offence that these 4 guys used. Also contains one of the best endings to a table match that i've ever seen. ECW fans won't moan at the WWF for this match.

4. Jericho VS Chyna VS Hardcore Holly, IC title: Avereage match with little in the way of excitement or surprise.
5. New Age Outlaws VS Acolytes, Tag Titles: Short pants match that had the potential to be very entertaining but once again X-Pac screws everything up.
6. Triple H VS Cactus Jack, Street Fight,WWF Title: This started Triple H's year of being the best wrestler in the WWF and showed at 33 Mick Foley still had it. The most brutal WWF title match in recent memory as the combatants used everything: Tables, chairs,barbwire and saving the best till last thumbtacks. Cactus takes a sick bump in the tacks leaving him beaten. Triple H got cut up really bad which was essential for the quality of the match. Cactus's best match I have ever seen as of yet but i haven't bought any FMW tapes yet!!

The swimsuit  contest was very entertaining and the table match was spectacular. The WWF  title match lived up to all of the hype beforehand. It was possibly the  most hardcore match that has ever take place in the WWF. The use of thumb  tacks and barbed wire is more recognised in an ECW ring. The rumble itself  was a bit disappointing.

1076799,5,630571035X,"Madison Square Garden is the WWF's home base, and whenever theyreturn to the arena for a show, they always try to put on an excellentone.  So what better place to go for the first PPV of the new millennium than good old MSG?  I'll tell you right now that Royal Rumble 2000 went beyond my expectations.  It's the best PPV that WWF has put on in a long, LONG time, killing anything 1999 spewed out, as with most of 1998.  It's a must-see for WWF fans everywhere.
Now here's how the story was going at this time: The McMahon-Helmsley Era is in total power, Vince having left in disgust of HHH and his daughter Stephanie the day after ARMAGEDDON.  HHH captures the WWF title for the third time from the Big Slow on the first Raw of 2000 and is once again truly ""The Game"".  As HHH and Steph swing their stroke around arrogantly, Mankind voices his displeasure and gets the crap kicked out of him.  HHH books a match: The Rock vs. Mankind in a Pink Slip on a Pole match, where the loser would have to retire.  Well, unsurprisingly, Foley loses.  Fast forward to two weeks or so later - every WWF superstar unites and threatens to walk out on HHH and Steph if certain stipulations are not met, including reinstating Mick Foley.  So Foley's back and the number one contender for the WWF title at Royal Rumble.  On Smackdown, Foley says Mankind is in no condition to wrestle HHH in a Street Fight at Royal Rumble and therefore needs a replacement.  Two words: BANG BANG!  CACTUS JACK IS BACK!
As I said before, this PPV rocked the entire arena and the homes of anybody watching.  I can't imagine a WWF missing out on this classic.  First off, there's Kurt Angle vs. Tazz, who was only known to be a mystery opponent before the PPV.  It was a decent match, and gave Tazz a good headstart.  The Dudleys vs. Hardyz in a Table Match was hardcore and exciting, exposing some great talent and elevating both tag teams in the WWF.  These teams can put on a hell of a show and much is expected from them in the future.  The triple threat IC title match with co-champions Chris Jericho and Chyna and Hardcore Holly was decent, scoring Y2J another victory.  The Bikini contest... um, I'll just stop now.  The Outlaws and Acolytes fight was a quickie and didn't need the little promo preceding the match telling how the feud started if the whole thing was going to end in less than 6 minutes anyway.
Now the WWF Championship match: HHH had been my favorite wrestler for quite some time, and this match, the Street Fight, earned him some new respect from me and I think most WWF fans. HHH and Foley destroyed each other in this match, putting on one of the best main events ever.  I think these two truly belong in the ring together.  They know a thing or two about putting on a good show, and did NOT disappoint in this one.  It had everything from barbed wire on a stick, to chair shots, to blood, to handcuffs, to thumbtacks (! ). And in the end, HHH comes out victorious (YEAH! )
The Rumble itself is good, Rikishi stealing a good amount of the show.  It's nice to see Rikishi and Too Cool dance in the middle of the match.  The Rock's pop is enormous and the crowd really gets into it as he dominates and wins the fight.  The end is also a very good and controversial setup for the Raws and Smackdowns to come.

1076802,5,630571035X,"Well, I was impressed.
The fact that the WWF's first pay-per-view of 2000 was in Madison Square Garden should have solidified the belief that this was going to be an ace card, and there was going to be plenty to talk  about.
Easily the best match on the card was the streetfight between  defending champion Triple H and Cactus Jack, a gory blood-fest that saw all  the usual streetfight weapons, and some that haven't been seen before.  Let's put it this way, each man took themselves to a new level that night.  Cactus Jack solidified his repultation as the ballsy, tough as nails  fighter that we know that he is, and Triple H proved that he's not a prissy  woman, and is prepared to take an incredible amount of pain.
Next on the  list as far as praise goes is the tables match pitting the Duley Boyz  against the Hardy Boyz.  If you want to talk innovation and extreme  high-spots, then this is your kind of match.  Both teams hold nothing back  and leave you exhausted after their ECW-esque war.
The Royal Rumble match  was your usual outing; the big names don't appear until the last 10, but  keep your eyes peeled for Rikishi's ear;y effort, and the subsequent  dancing in the middle of the match with his buddies Too Cool.  Sheer  brilliance.  As far as the actual result goes, I think you can predict that  it will be either The Rock or the Big Show, especially after ""The  Great One's"" interview earlier on in the night.
As for the other  matches, the Triple Threat Intercontinental Title match is passable, thanks  to the efforts of Hardcore Holly, while Chris Jericho and Chyna merely go  through the motions.  Kurt Angle realised that ""the mood is about to  change"" as he prepares himself to face a ""mystery opponent""  - which everyobdy in the crowd has already guessed -  and the New Age  Outlaws put together a tremendous match against the Acolytes, filled with  innovation and excellence.
I'm joking, of course, this is the Outlaws  we're talking about.
However, all in all, Royal Rumble 2000 was a great  PPV, and sent the fans home happy.  Definately one for the wrestling fan's  video library.  And if you don't have a wresling video library, this video  isn't a bad place to start.",956620800,,2201,4.596899224806202

Angle comes to the ring and cuts a promo on how bad the New York Knicks and Patrick Ewing are. Angle who was booked to face a mystery opponent going into the PPV, cuts a cocky promo on them. This was right around the time, the IWC was in its early baby stages as there are a few  ""we want Tazz"" chants heard that eventually grow into large chants from everyone in the arena. Well enough, it was true, as the heartbeat and cardiac monitor is sounded and Tazz makes his way to the ring from a huge pop from the MSG crowd; making his official in-ring WWF debut. Angle stays in control a little bit at the beginning but Tazz comes back with a trio of nicely executed suplexes. Tazz slaps on the Tazzmission and Angle passes out, and the referee rules Tazz as the winner, ending Angle's undefeated streak. However, Angle would later go to state that because he never tapped or got pinned, he didn't really lose and his undefeated streak was still intact

This match was as good as you'd expect it to be for being a Tables Match. This was in the early stages of the E&C vs Hardyz vs Dudleyz feud that would take the Tag Team division by storm for the remainder of the Attitude Era. The Hardyz had just had a classic Ladder Match with Edge and Christian months before at No Mercy in 1999 and now here they were competing against The Dudleyz in a Tables Match. Lots of crashes and brutal and high-flying spots to fill your appetite. The crowd eats every last bit of this match up. Sick spot where Bubba is knocked off a ledge and goes crashing through about 4 tables. Moments later, Jeff dives off that same ledge, onto D-Von at the bottom with a Swanton Bomb through a table for the win. Jeff would pull off that same stunt from the same spot in the same arena, 2 years later at the 2002 Survivor Series. Amazing match. Of course, 3 months after this we'd get something twice as great with the Triangle Ladder Match at Wrestlemania 2000

3.) Miss Royal Rumble 2000 Swimsuit Competition: Ivory vs Terri vs Jacqueline vs B.B vs Luna vs The Kat vs Mae Young

In 1999 and early 2000, the WWF was notorious for putting their divas in some of the worst segments and contests and matches but some of the best for entertainment...which I guess is all that really mattered at the end of the day. The stipulation was that simply the diva who had the best bikini would be declared the winner of the Miss Royal Rumble 2000 Swimsuit Contest. Tony Garea, Sgt. Slaughter, Fabulous Moolah, Johnny Valiant, Freddie Blassie, and Andy Richter were the judges for this contest, while Jerry Lawler was the host (as he usually was for these kinds of contests back in the day). After all the divas show off what they have, the fans are prepared to name The Kat the winner until Mae Young enters as a late entry and says she's going to show the fans her ""puppies"". Mae Young shows off her goods and exposes her boobs to every unlucky man sitting in the audience. If I remember, they were originally uncensored on the live PPV broadcast. Mark Henry runs out and covers Mae and the judges for some odd reason, pick Mae Young as the winner. Pointless, funny, and semi-entertaining was this contest. Lawler was hilarious all the way throughout. When it came to the divas back in 1999 and early 2000, WWF tried their hardest to make it resemble Jerry Springer in terms of trash TV. This was one of those times that it succeeded in being just that

4.) WWF Triple Threat Intercontinental Championship Match: Hardcore Holly vs Chyna (c) vs Chris Jericho (c)

Both Jericho and Chyna were the co-holders of the Intercontinental Championship so they, along with the third edition of Hardcore Holly were going to battle it out to determine who would be the undisputed Intercontinental Champion. Lots of fun back and forth action is exchanged between Holly, Y2J, and Chyna for the duration of the match. Chyna waffles Holly with a chair behind the referee's back, Jericho with a bulldog on Chyna, followed by a Lionsault for the win. Short but entertaining match. I just wish it had lasted a bit longer

5.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The Acolytes vs The New Age Outlaws (c)

The Acolytes were in the midst of becoming a babyface team and it was right around this time where they began transitioning from the Satan worshipers to the beer drinking, bar fighting, butt kicking brawlers that fans would come to know and love. The Acolytes storm the ring and this match starts off pretty chaotic. Billy ends up taking a sick Clothesline From Hell and the referee ends up getting bumped into several seconds later. Shortly after, X-Pac interferes and takes out Bradshaw but gets beaten up by Faarooq for his troubles. Faarooq goes after Road Dogg, while Billy hits a Fameasser on Bradshaw for the win.

6.) WWF Championship Street Fight Match: Cactus Jack vs Triple H (c)

For the second Royal Rumble in a row, Mick Foley was fighting in a brutal match for the WWF Championship; the previous year being against his unforgettable I Quit Match against The Rock. Only this one would be more violent than the I Quit Match. The build-up for this match was extraordinary and really built up Foley as being the underdog for this match. The match wastes no time in bringing out the violence as Cactus Jack takes a chair shot to the head from HHH within the opening minutes of the match. Triple H draws first blood after Foley nails him in between the eyes with a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire; a weapon that would become a specialty in most of Foley's matches going forward. HHH ends up getting back in control and in shades of the 1999 Royal Rumble, handcuffs Foley and beats him down until The Game is clocked with a chair by The Rock. Foley ends up breaking out of the handcuffs, and as the match begins riding near the end, Foley brings in ""that sack"" to the ring. Yet somehow, the announcers don't seem to remember the King of the Ring 1998 and act oblivious to what's in the bag. Foley pour thumbtacks from the bag, all over the ring and gets backdropped on to them for his troubles. A cringe-worthy Pedigree into the thumbtacks later and this bloodfest is over and Triple H is the winner. The Game is rolled out on a stretcher but Foley wheels him back to the ring and bashes Helmsley over the head one more time with the 2x4 One of the Attitude Era's best matches ever! Definitely a must-watch.

7.) 2000 Royal Rumble Match

D'Lo Brown and Grandmaster Sexay start things off as the first two entrants and the match pretty much rolls in a slow standard way for the rest of the way through. There was a nice part of the match where Too Cool and Rikishi were the only ones in the ring and danced for a nice pop from the crowd before Rikishi threw them both over the top rope, eliminating them. Test who entered at #10 surprisingly got a pretty loud pop from the crowd as well. Really this Royal Rumble match was a lot like the 1999 Royal Rumble: slow and at times very boring. There was a lot of star power in this match but there was a lack of build-up that focused on this star power. The crowd was quiet for most of the match as it could be assumed that they were all sitting on their hands, waiting for Rock to come in who was #24. The final 2 are down to The Rock and Big Show. Rock wins after reversing an attempted elimination from Show and sending Big Show to the outside. The Rock grabs a microphone and says he's going to Wrestlemania but Rock's celebration is cut short as Big Show re-enters the ring, attacks The Rock, and throws him to the outside, turning heel (imagine that).

Overall: Not a bad at Royal Rumble PPV. The undercard was booked very well and the WWF Championship match was illustrious. It's the Royal Rumble match though that kind of kills some of the steam this PPV had. For the 3rd year in a row, the company had failed to really use it's entire roster to its full potential in making the Royal Rumble unpredictable and giving fans several possible outcomes for the winner of the Rumble. Initially, The Rock and Big Show were the only 2 likely candidates to win the match. And when you look at both of them, it was pretty obvious that The Rock was going to win. They'd manage to get it right the following year though. I didn't have a problem with The Rock winning. I just wish they'd made the Rumble build-up a bit more fun and unpredictable. Aside from that match, the first WWF PPV of 2000 was really well done. Of course the biggest match from this card was the epic and bloody Street Fight match. Foley and HHH had an amazing feud in the early parts of 2000. Overall, the 2000 Royal Rumble gets a 4/5 stars from me.",1421366400,,10525,4.999428571428571

7895091,4,630571035X,"The 2000 version of the Royal Rumble is my favorite to date.  This PPV is also one of my favorite WWE events of all time.  The undercard was very solid and the rumble itself was great as well.  The Madison Square Garden crowd was into the festivities the whole time.

Here is the card:

Kurt Angle vs. Tazz
I liked this choice to be the opener for this event.  Kurt Angle was on a great winning streak at the time, and came out to the ring to cut a promo about it to remind us.  The buildup was nice for the match.  Tazz came out and the two put on a fast paced match with one another.  The technical display was there, with a series of suplexes in and out of the ring.  The only thing that brings it down was the short time it lasted and how Kurt got squashed and was carried out on a stretcher, but nonetheless was a good opener.

Table Match:
Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz
This was the first ever tag team table match.  The teams were the only appropriate teams to be entered into it.  The pace was good, and the chemistry was better.  This will not go down to be the best tag team table match ever performed, but it was still very good with a lot of history.  Jeff Hardy does an exciting dive from one of the corridors to the arena (see Survivor Series 2002).  Some of the execution is a little sloppy but overall another great matchup.

Miss Rumble Swimsuit Contest:
Ivory vs. Terri vs. Jacqueline vs. BB vs. Luna Vachon vs. The Kat vs. Mae Young
This was gross.  Most of the women were really hot, but the Mae Young scene when she strips off her top is simply repulsive.

Intercontinental Title Triple Treat Match:
Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly
Ahh-- this needed a lot of work.  I would have preferred the match be just between Holly and Jericho.  Sure, Chyna was a co-champion, but there are just too many botches in this encounter.  The ending move when Jericho lionsaults Chyna is a botch, which brings this down a little more.  It overall is not too bad, but had some mechanical errors and somewhat of an abrupt ending.  Even though Holly has nothing to do with the storyline between Chyna and Jericho, he saves the match in my opinion.  Most of the time I did not mind having Chyna as champ, but she does not look good in this match.  Worth a look once or twice, but the quality of the wrestling is not all there.

World Tag Titles:
Road Dogg & Billy Gunn vs. Farooq & Bradshaw
Aggressive, charismatic, quick paced, interesting, and SHORT are probably the best adjectives used to describe this.  The match is good quality and very watchable, but way too short for my liking.  I personally really liked this match, but will never know what it could have potentially became.

WWF Title Street Fight:
Triple H w/ Stephanie McMahon vs. Cactus Jack
There is only one thing to say about this match, UNBELIEVABLE.  Why doesn't WWE ever give us anything like this anymore?  The match is the definition of hardcore.  The weaponry used is endless and the match is extremely brutal.  There is tons of blood here as well.  Both men get put through hell to entertain the Madison Square Garden audience.  The match has perfect timing, a genuine appeal, and never ending violence.  To add to it, there is a segment of the match where the Rock interferes and allows the match to take a climactic turn.  I first saw the match on Foley's ""Greatest Hits and Misses"" DVD, and bought the Royal Rumble 2000 just for this match.  I have watched the match several times over.  A classic!

Royal Rumble Match:
I thought this rumble match was above average.  There were not a lot of big names in the match itself, but it opened a lot of doors for those others participating.  I liked the dominance Rikishi showed in the beginning, and a lot of the entertainment that it brought with the dancing and all.  The pace in the beginning of the match is a little slow with few superstars in the ring at one time, but it picked up towards the end of the rumble.  Sure the conclusion is a little predictable, but I was satisfied with the outcome.  There was some interference with Kaientai throughout which was actually very comedic, and a sick spill to TAKA.  This was overall a great way to end a great show.

Madison Square Garden always seems to be the home for great WWE PPV events.  This show will go down in the books as being one of the most original and model events in recent WWE history.  I highly recommend it.",1273536000,2,4408,4.381481481481481
