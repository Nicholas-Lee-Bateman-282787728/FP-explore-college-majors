1404415,5,B000059GEK,Oh my god! when I saw the reconstruction of somethings got to give I was really getting into the movie . When Cukor's words CUT and the slow motion release of character recorded of dean and marilyn was  very true to life .  The unfinished film is exactly the metaphor  for marilyns  short unfinished life. Just watch it and it can teach humans that it can all end that quick. Marilyn has taught me this . She is an inspiration. I hope there is a 2cd diamond collection.,991612800,,469,4.295454545454546
1404416,5,B000059GEK,"Yes, this truly is THE one Marilyn collection that DVD buyers would love to get the best. And, yes, would have been greater if Fox use ""Let Make Love"" instead of ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", to make DVD collectors happy to get, but, that would ended up to be a rough in this one (So does ""Show Business"", but why enjoyed the ""Tropical Heat Wave"" number, and forget the rest?)! The set's bread-and-butter is the documentary co-produced by Fox, American Movie Classic and the Marilyn Estate, ""Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days"", which described the making of her unfinished film, ""Something Got To Give"", which the 37-minute reconstruction is the Centerpiece of the DVD.

And it is made clear in these gatherings of her filme. Monroe never worked in a brilliant film-outside of ""Some like it hot"" of course but her acting in these films is not great but it is her pesona and that is what she brings to the screen in all of these flicks. She is the originator and everyone copies her style from Cher,Madonna,Demi ...starlett.

1404455,5,B000059GEK,"The Diamond Collection represents some of Marilyn Monroe's greatest achievements on film! This first installation of the Diamond Collection certainly contains her most well-known films, and is a must have for Marilyn fans.

Within this collection are the titles ""Bus Stop"" -- ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" -- ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" -- ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" -- ""The Seven Year Itch"" -- and a documentary chronicling the final days of Marilyn Monroe.

My favorite Marilyn film is the one that saw her star rise, and that's ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"". Her infamous musical number 'Diamonds are a girls best friend' is found within this film. During Marilyn's era in the film industry, almost ALL actors contracted to the different studios were required to not only be able to act, but to be able to dance and sing as well. Marilyn's singing voice wasn't strong, but it still had a beautifully hypnotic lilt to it, and made her unique in this respect.

""The Seven Year Itch"" contains her infamous grater scene in which a gust of wind blows up her white skirt, thus creating a fabulous moment in cinematic history. According to witnesses, the director of the film had to ask Marilyn to wear two pairs of undergarments because the camera was picking up the fact that she was *not* a natural blonde.

There are far too many memorable Marilyn moments to list them all, but I highly recommend this collection of DVDs. In addition to the five Marilyn films included in the set, there is an added bonus of a documentary titled ""The Final Days"" in which it chronicles -- what else -- the final days of Ms. Monroe. This documentary also pieces together the fragmented footage of the film ""Somethings Got to Give"", which Marilyn was in the process of shooting at the time of her tragic death. Included in this footage is the skinny-dipping scene Marilyn had completed, which would have certainly become just as infamous has many of her other scenes.

My only regret is that Marilyn films from other studios, such as the charismatic ""Some Like it Hot"", or even the Olivier production of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", could not be included in either installments of the Diamond Collection.

I simply can't say it enough, this is a wonderful collection, and a great tribute to the loving memory of Marilyn Monroe.",1176768000,,2319,4.828715365239295
1404456,5,B000059GEK,I got this for my other half for chrismas.  It was a big hit.  A perfect gift for any Monroe fan that does not have it yet.,1174348800,,123,3.5185185185185186
1404457,5,B000059GEK,"This collection of films is a must-have for fans of Marilyn Monroe. The tragic ending to her life is forgotten while the watcher is mesmerized by her overwhelming stage presence that outshines everyone else on the screen. Her characters always portray an innocence that shines through her sexual magnetism. What never comes through in her performances is her own troubled life. In Bus Stop, she has a southern accent and, for once, isn't playing herself. How to Marry a Millionaire is filled with great stars of the past--Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable and William Powell, as well as Marilyn Monroe. The story has never lost its humor and charm. There's No Business like Show Business is the story of a vaudeville family, and Marilyn doesn't enter the picture immediately. Here, we are  bowled over by the magnificent stage presence of Ethel Merman, who manages to put everyone else in the shade--including Mitzi Gaynor, Donald O'Connor and Marilyn. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes remains such a fun story with Russell and Monroe paired up in some wonderful mixups. There are some fabulous musical numbers, most notably ""Ain't There Anyone Her for Love?"" and ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend."" The Seven Year Itch, while perhaps toned down for the censors of the time is funny and unforgettable.",1140998400,2,1288,5.046948356807512
1404458,5,B000059GEK,This is a great box set to add to any collection.  The movies are all in widescreen so you aren't missing any of the orginal picture.

1404475,5,B000059GEK,"I have seen all these movies many times. I'm so happy they are all on a nice dvd collection. Marilyn shines as always in everything. Show Business is the least of my favorites but Marilyn does several great songs in this , well worth seeing her sing ""After you get what you want"" & ""Heat Wave"". The Final Days was really interesting , to see marilyn's last movie footage, that was never finished. I don't see the the ""drug daze"" as some have mentioned here"". I think she looked great and seemed to have it all together other than forgeting a few lines and showing up late. It leaves alot to speculate as to what was really going on with Marilyn in her last days. Somethings Got to Give if finsihed would have been a cute 60's comedy, much like Doris Days films. Marilyn was on her way to becoming a  great comedian..

Add ""Some Like it Hot"", ""Misfits"", and ""Prince and the Showgirl"" ""River of No Return"" to this collection, and you will have the best of Marilyn's films.",1104105600,3,970,4.383333333333334

In Gentlemen, she's fun and wise, not a dumb blonde at all and in The 7 Year Itch, she comes across as a genuine young woman who wants to boost Tom Ewell's morale.",1102636800,,356,4.3283582089552235
1404477,5,B000059GEK,"I'll confine this review to the disc,""Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days"", which does not seem to be available elsewise in the United States. That said...

 James Ellroy fans (and homicide cops) will tell you: Don't fall in love with a dead woman. It's an occupational hazard of theirs, and they know it well; it leads to heartbreak, ulcers, early retirement, or eating a hollowpoint. This DVD may present you with a bit of insight-maybe a little more than you have in mind-as to this state of affairs.

 ""Something's Got To Give"", a remake of a story as old as silent theatrical film, was to have been a quick and profitable moneymaking project for 20th-Century Fox, who were in serious economic straits over the massively overbudget production of 'Cleopatra"". It starred Marilyn Monroe, Cyd Charisse, and Dean Martin, and became a quagmire of its own due to problems with Marilyn and director George Cukor. Eventually MM was fired, Dean Martin refused to work with her replacement Lee Remick, MM rehired and production rescheduled when Marilyn was found dead at her house, 8/05/1962. Of course that ended the movie: its footage was put in a vault, essentially unmolested for forty years.

 In 1999, American Movie Classics paid to have the extant footage built out as far as it would go, making a release that is in essence an abruptly ending 37 minutes of what would have been a roughly 90 minute film. The film quality is superb and the scenes marvelous, including the famous swimming pool sequence which would have been the first nude scene in an American theatrical release, at least since the days of the Hays code (as it turns out that honor went to MM emulator Jayne Mansfield in 1963's 'Promises,Promises'.)

 There's the tough part. Marilyn Monroe, at the age of 35, is in the best shape of her life and is absolutely magnificent in this footage. When the film ends abruptly and rolls memoriam credits-as if on a Moviola-you are seeing her on the last theatrical film shot of her in her life, the last day of her career, June 1, 1962. Her thirty-sixth birthday.

 Nine weeks later, she was dead.

 I'll spare the details, except to say that I've never met a ME or homicide officer who thinks it was suicide (and I deal with police officers and departments for a living.) If thinking about her doesn't bother you a little, you may be missing something. I can't put it any other way. If you're a lukewarm MM fan, you might really not want to watch this, because the game isn't necessarily worth the candle. If you don't get her at all, think you're 'stone to the bone'. or are a serious fan wanting to see all there is of Marilyn, this DVD will likely be one of the most important you have ever watched.",1101686400,11,2708,4.642259414225942
1404478,4,B000059GEK,"OK, finally, the six videos in the first Diamond Collection, meaning her 20th Century Fox pictures.  Not all are flawless gems, but rather most are the ones she is best known for, and we get an indepth, well-detailed narrative of her aborted last movie.
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes:  Yes, the musical that put Marilyn on the map after the success of Niagara.  This movie is dated, but there's also the mindset of the opposites of its two stars.  Lorelei Lee will simply drool over a diamond, while Dorothy drools over big pecs.  Things aren't that way today.  And the classic ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" led Madonna to duplicate that scene in her ""Material Girl"" video.  Good songs and numbers mask a so-so plot and characters.  Rating:  3.5
How To Marry A Millionaire:  The second Cinemascope film made, Millionaire has MM teaming up with Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall, out to snag rich husbands.  MM is Pola, a myopic blonde who keeps bumping into walls and things without her glasses, which she is reluctant to wear because ""men aren't attracted to women who wear glasses.""  That's what she thinks.  Again, the materialistic ""money is everything"" theme prevalent in the 1950's.  Not bad, though.  (Rating:  4).
There's No Business Like Show Business:  Marilyn only has a supporting role as Donald O'Connor's love interest in this one, with the really hot Latin-flavoured ""Heat Wave"" number a highlight.  Most of the drama in this splashy but with no substance movie goes to Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, and O'Connor.  Rating:  3
The Seven Year Itch:  This has been my favourite MM film, not because of the skirt scene.  For one thing, there's Tom Ewell's character, the married Richard Sherman, who has been happily married for seven years and has a great imagination, but not much esteem.  Enter the Girl, a figure out of a dream, who tells him in a speech towards the end:  ""But there's another guy in the room, way over in the corner.  Maybe he's kind of nervous and shy and perspiring a little.  First you look past him, but then you sort of sense he's gentle and kind and worried, and he'll be tender with you.  Nice and sweet.  That's what's really exciting.  If I were your wife, I'd be very very jealous of you.""  That cheered me up given my looks.  Rating:  5
Bus Stop:  The first film she did using Method acting, this is the film touted as the one where she could finally act, in her role as Cheri, a singer looking for respect who is initially flattered at the courtesy given by Bo, a green cowboy, who is so smitten at her, he intends to marry her, something that stuns her.  She has no plans of marrying him, but unfortunately, Bo can't take no for an answer.  Rating:  4
The Final Days:  James Coburn narrates the events surrounding the making of Something's Got To Give, a remake of the Cary Grant/Irene Dunne comedy My Favourite Wife.  The film would've been Marilyn's 21st, but due to her frequent absenteeism, an overdose, conflicts between director George Cukor and various writers, and the impatience of Fox studio heads desperate to be bailed out at the big slurping sound of cash draining at another debacle of a film also starring a temperamental actress, Cleopatra with Liz Taylor, it was alas not to be.  Marilyn shines in some moments, such as the scene with the children.  And the scene in the swimming pool is equal in exhibitionism as the skirt scene in The Seven Year Itch.  She shows a bit of her derriere when she puts on the bathing gown, something that wouldn't have been allowed in the final cut, (read Mr. Hays).  However, other scenes and outtakes show her in a drug-induced haze.  Also included is the first 15-20 completed minutes of Something's Got To Give, where Marilyn totally shines in her scenes with Dean Martin and the children.  I saw possibilities in this, as two months after being fired, MM had successfully negotiated a return to production for the film with a higher salary.  That was on 1 August.  Four days later, she was dead.  (Rating:  4.5)
Overall rating:  (3.5+4+3+5+4+4.5)/6=4.",1075334400,5,4045,4.7018544935805995
1404479,4,B000059GEK,"Take ""There's no Business like show business""(a completely awful movie which showcases marilyn's voice and body while the rest of it bores the heck out of you) out of this great collection of MM's films, and you have got quite a nice set of movies to feast upon.  Also, the documentary, which originally aired on AMC, ""The Last Days"", is outstanding.  Marilyn looks stunning in the footage of her last work on film that was never shown until now.
""The Seven Year Itch"", ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, ""How to Marry a Millionare"", and ""Bus Stop""(yippee!! finally back and looking fantastic on dvd) are all great movies of Marilyn's and throwing that monstrosity I mention above in was in bad taste.

1404480,5,B000059GEK,"Marilyn Monroe was a true diva of the movie screen. That her personal life failed to measure up to the dizzying heights of her film career is a tragedy and one that none of her on-screen performances ever seems to hint of. FOX STUDIOS have outdone themselves on this collection of her best work. ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" is the movie with Monroe's signature trademark, 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'. But this is hardly a one hit wonder. As a DVD, Fox's lurid Technicolor comes across loud and clear with remarkable resolution and clarity. The same can be said for the rest of the films included in this box set (The Seven Year Itch, Bus Stop, There's No Business Like Show Business, How To Marry A Millionaire) though film purists will note that both ""Millionaire"" and ""Itch"" have retained some of their grain and splice seams, an inherent flaw of early Cinemascope photography. Still, this is the best any of these films have ever looked, save their original Hollywood premiere. The remarkable fidelity of Alfred Newman's ""A Street Scene"", the overture played prior to ""Millionaire"" is so stirring I found myself straining to hear the imperfections of 1950's recording technology. They are practically non-existent. This box set also includes the wonderful documentary, Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days as well as a reconstruction of the footage shot for Monroe's last, incomplete film, ""Something's Got To Give"". This is a wonderful chance to see the Monroe that never was or will be, a last look at the goddess that defined an era of sexuality and innocence, strangely blended to perfection in the embodiment of one angelic, but sadly, thoroughly lost little girl.",1046995200,2,1673,4.978571428571429

I have watched ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" at least 6 times over the past 2 months.  I have a serious issue with the costume and hair designer of the movie because they really made Jane look not as attractive as she is, and some of the dresses and the color of the dresses selected for Marilyn were just wrong.  The movie would have been even more spectacular with the correct clothing ensemble. Besides that, we can observe a tremendous amount of information on life and men from Marilyn and Jane. ""The Seven Year Itch"" is the another diamond in this collection.  The movie is just perfect.  Marilyn is the funniest actress.  She is just superb.  I wish she had won an academy award during her acting career. In ""Bus Stop"" we see the transformation in Marilyn's acting ability.  She was good before and now she is even better.  This movie really demonstrates the hard work she put into her acting education.  She really should have won the academy award in this movie.  The ""show business"" film was OK.

However, it's final scenes reveal an emotionally scarred young woman's character that is hauntingly reminiscent of the ""Marilyn Mystique"". The second film is ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", from 1954. It's a back-stage show business melodrama; dated and slow. However, this new DVD offering is dripping with luxurious, mind-bogeling color. Dan Dailey co-stars, along with a very young Hugh O'Brian.  The third film is 1955's ""Seven Year Itch"". Director Billy Wilder had filmed the classic ""Sunset Boulevard"" just 5 years before. ""The Seven Year Itch"" was a smash Broadway comedy hit for 3 years. Tom Ewell signed on to repeat his starring role. Ewell plays a hen-pecked husband, alone for the summer in his sweltering Manhattan flat. Then he meets ""the girl"". It's a fast moving satirical romp. The timing and acting are superb. It's near perfect. The fourth film is ""How to Marry a Millionaire"", from 1953. This vibrant, classy comedy stars Marilyn along with Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall, and Hollywood icon William Powell, who once romanced Jean Harlow. Marilyn easily steals the show. Her ditzy, near-sighted blond model named Pola is a scream from begining to end. Next is ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes(1953)"". A famous action director, this was Howard Hawk's only musical. Jane Russell co-stars. The shipboard scene with Marilyn, Charles Coburn, and George Winslow ranks among the funniest ever shot! Finally comes a special treasure trove of Hollywood legend. ""Something's Got to Give"" has been locked away in a 20th Century film vault for 40 years. Carefully edited from 9 hours of film never seen before, it is perhaps the first half of her final intended film. Shot in 1962, it features her only nude scene. George Cukor directed parts of ""Gone With the Wind"" in 1939. Here he leads Marilyn and barks orders at child actors on the set. An exceptional cast includes Dean Martin, Cyd Charisse,Phil Silvers, Steve Allen, and the mysterious Wally Cox. 19 days behind schedule, filming was suspended due to Marilyn's poor health. Marilyn enticed the studio to begin re-filming, armed with a new million-dollar contract and a 2 picture deal. Ravaged by 10 years of Hollywood stardom, Marilyn suffered bouts of depression. She died in August, 1962, of a pill overdose. For the first time ever, the camera opens the door on this fragile, frightened, and damaged little girl living in a still beautiful 35 year-old woman's body. ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"". But having just one friend might have helped save this little girl.",994118400,5,2854,5.085287846481877

1404504,5,B000059GEK,"If you've been dying to get your hands on your own Marilyn Monroe collection of movies, this will satisfy most of your desire. The only weak film is ""There's No Business Like Show Business,"" which is of course about the show biz family.  However, its musical numbers are terrific and make up for the rest of it.  All of the remaining films you can't go wrong with though.  ""Seven Year Itch"" is a delight with Tom Ewell fantasizing over Monroe big time when she becomes his neighbor as he goes through a marital crisis period.  Billy Wilder directed it and she was at her best when he was at the helm.  (They also did ""Some Like It Hot"" together which should be in this collection too (and would be my substitute for ""Show Business"".)

The famous Monroe dress blowing up because of the air blast from the subway through the street grating occurs here.  ""Millionaire"" is a favorite as well showcasing three women, Monroe, Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable, in 1950s New York trying to land millionaires as husbands. More than money though, Monroe's weakness is finding a man who likes the way she looks while she is wearing glasses as she is blind as a bat and contacts didn't exist.

The romance that sizzles the most is Bacall's but Monroe is a standout comically whenever she is onscreen. In ""Gentlemen,"" Monroe is wonderful as gold digger Lorelei Lee and this is also where one of her most memorable musical numbers occurs, ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend.""  There is one serious film too, based on a William Inge play, ""Bus Stop.""  Many thought Monroe could not act in the work of a serious playwright but this movie proved them wrong.  She is a saloon singer romanced by a cowboy played by Don Murray, who did some very good films in the 1950s but is largely forgotten nowadays. What's missing?  You really must see ""The Misfits"" and ""Let's Make Love"" too.

""The Misfits"" is probably my personal favorite of Monroe's but it is her most serious film and probably would not fit in with this mostly frothy collection.  ""Bus Stop"" is actually very upbeat by its conclusion whereas playwright Arthur Miller went for broke with his searing ""The Misfits,"" written while his marriage with Monroe failed.  ""Let's Make Love"" would have fit in perfectly with this collection, however, as charming romance fare with Yves Montand as her French tycoon love interest.  The forty minutes or so of ""Something's Got To Give"" are very sad.  Had the movie been finished, I think it would have been a slight work, especially following on the heels of ""Misfits.""

1404505,5,B000059GEK,"I was not quite six when Marilyn Monroe died. I vaguely remember hearing that she had died at the time, and, having already seen pictures of her, felt very sorry for this beautiful, gentle lady. Even at that young age, I thought that she was ""very nice"" and ""gentle"", not to mention beautiful, and had a ""childlike sensitivity"" about her. I have been a fan of hers ever since. I always feel good when I watch her(Betty Grable had that same ""feel good"" quality to her), and also more than a little sad. I don't need to go into any detailed accounts about the sad ""sex goddess'"" life, as millions of miles of print have followed since her demise. But I AM ecstatic that five of her best films have been lovingly restored and enhanced and released in this DVD boxed set of Valentine's Day eye-candy. ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", her first musical-comedy smash as the gold-digging Lorelei Lee,co-starring that ""full-figured gal"" Jane Russell, looks and sounds incredible-the colors are vivid, the picture sharp, and the sound clear. The colors in the legendary ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" number are SO vivid, it's akin to having an LSD flashback! ""Blondes"" showcases two voracious, funny, sexy gals in action-the wimpy men don't stand a chance! Marilyn's star continued to rise in ""How to Marry a Millionaire"", 20th Century Fox's 2nd Cinemascope venture, co-starring the delightful Betty Grable(Marilyn's predecessor as Fox's top blonde),and Lauren Bacall, whose high-fashion looks are served to good advantage in this Technicolor fashion show on film. ""Marilyn Mania"" continued to grow in the 50s as she co-starred in ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", a twenty-gun salute to Irving Berlin's music, featuring belting Broadway legend Ethel Merman, song-and-dance men Dan Dailey and Donald O'Connor, singing teardrop Johnnie Ray, and the vivacious Mitzi Gaynor. Marilyn's notorious ""Heat Wave"" number is her big number in the film, and the film is a pretty, pleasant no-brainer. ""Marilyn Mania"" reached its peak in the Billy Wilder-directed comedy, ""The Seven Year Itch"", in which Marilyn plays the upstairs neighbor of nerdy, married, middle-aged Tom Ewell, and becomes the object of his wild and fervid fantasies. She is breathtakingly beautiful and absolutely delightful as the somewhat dizzy but intrinsically very wise dish who stands above a subway grating to feel the breezes waft up around her-""Oh, here comes another one!"" This film was made in the innuendo-ridden 50s, and  has a campy, comic-book like eroticism of its own-a funny ""men's magazine"" on film. But Marilyn had begun to grow tired of her ""one-note"" roles, and surprised many when she went on suspension from 20th Century Fox, took acting classes at The Actors Studio, and took on the role of Cherie in the film version of William Inge's ""Bus Stop"". Marilyn wanted to prove that she could be an ""actress"" in this film, and not just a ""joke"". And what a performance she gave! The film, as is the play, is somewhat hokey and dated, but watch it for Marilyn-she's like a wayward Daisy Mae who wants more out of life. Her rendition of ""That Old Black Magic"" is a classic-with her awkward, nervous gestures, scared, tinny voice, hillbilly accent,and seedy saloon girl costume, she is both pitiful and adorable-you just want to take care of her. Rounding out this DVD collection is the AMC documentary ""Marilyn-The Final Days"". The film is both informative and very depressing-having restored her last, unfinished film ""Something's Got to Give"", and filmed numerous interviews with co-star Cyd Charisse, hairdresser Peggy Shannon, and others, including one of her many doctors,  AMC presents a very sad (no surprises here!) glimpse into part of Marilyn's private hell from which, to her, death seemed the only escape-or so we have been led to believe. The truth about this very sad, sensitive, talented, beautiful girl's death will probably always remain unspoken-as many of her contemporaries and romantic liasons are also gone-dead sex symbols tell no tales. And so, Saint Marilyn, I still love you, as millions of others who never met or knew you, do too. You died for our sins. So if you love Marilyn, there should be no question-buy this boxed set-it's truly a love letter to Marilyn and her special, unmatched magic!",991872000,6,4298,5.043600562587905
1404506,5,B000059GEK,"This DVD set is truly a dream come true for any Marilyn fan.  I have been a fan for 25+ years now and love all of her films.  The quality of this set is fantastic.  The reconstucted 40 minutes of ""Something's Got to Give"" is enough to make you cry.  Her acting is fabulous and she looks great.  I was torn into a millions bits watching this.  Those 40 minutes, especially the scenes with Marilyn, have to rank as probably the greatest in my movie watching experience.  This is no exaggeration.  I am a huge Marilyn fan and I was moved.

7933153,5,B000059GEK,"Marilyn Monroe has emerged as one of the most popular film actresses of all time. Most scholars dismiss Monroe as having no acting talent, but I must disagree. She had a dynamite comic timing, did exceptionally well with musical numbers, and was very under-rated dramatic actress. The films assembled here together show the talent of Monroe when she used to the best of her potential.

1) Niagara (1953/Color/88 minutes): This was the movie that gave Marilyn her major breakthrough. She plays a seductive woman named Rose who plans to have her husband (Joseph Cotten) killed so she can run away with her younger lover. Another couple, Polly (Jean Peters) and Ray Cutler (""Casey Adams"") find themselves tangled up this very good suspense-filled movie. As the title suggests, the entire story takes place around Niagara Falls. This was one of the first ""film noirs"" shot in Technicolor. Look out for some sexy Monroe scenes and a long-shot of her walking from the camera.

2) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953/Color/91 minutes): Riding high on the success of Niagara, Monroe headlined this musical comedy with the ravishing Jane Russell. Monroe and Russell play showgirl best friends who find love and scandal on their way to France by ship. Bright, glamorous, and timeless. This feature is full of fine comedy and catchy tunes, all given to us by great performers. Contains Monroe's famous version of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"".

3) There's No Business Like Show Business (1954/Color/117 minutes): Most Monroe fans will know that Monroe herself had no interest in making this film; she did it to fulfill contract obligations. With that said, this is very ""full"" movie. There's a lot of singing, naturally, and a lot of extravagance. There are some beautiful sets and bright colors, but it's a little too much for my tastes. Monroe, this go around, plays only a supporting role as a hat-check girl-turned-showgirl who comes between a showbiz man (Donald O'Connor) and his family (Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Mitzi Gaynor, and Johnnie Ray).

4) The Seven Year Itch (1955/Color/105 minutes): By this era in her career, Monroe was at the pinnacle of her popularity; she was one of the world's most photographed women and one of the nation's foremost box office attractions. Here, she plays a nameless beauty who becomes the object of desire for a middle man (Tom Ewell) while his wife and son are away for the summer. Containing Monroe's famous ""white dress"" scene, the movie is enjoyably funny and undeniably classic.

5) Bus Stop (1956/Color/96 minutes): This was first movie made following her studying at the Actors Studio in NYC. This is a sophisticated romantic comedy; there are few songs, and Monroe is not nearly as glamorous as she was in her other roles, but she's as captivating as ever. She plays Cherie, a roadhouse torch singer who is ""kidnapped"" and nearly forced into marrying a fresh-off-the-ranch cowboy. You'll have to watch and find out if she does actually marry him. Definitely one of Marilyn's finest performances.

6) Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days (2001/Color & B&W/90 minutes): This made-for-TV documentary heavily focuses on, as the title states, Monroe's ""final days"". Most of the film deals with her filming the unfinished Something's Got to Give, and the other events that made up the last months of her life. Very informative.

Good set of Monroe DVDs. Highly Recommended.",1468886400,,3403,5.044483985765124
