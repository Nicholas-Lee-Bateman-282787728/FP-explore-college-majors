5526381,5,B00AY2DL78,This PBS special is totally worth the watch for Downton fans and lovers of history alike.  It gives insight into the castle itself and the family that has maintained it for years as well as some general history of estate life in the last 200 years.,1363737600,,248,4.391304347826087
5526382,5,B00AY2DL78,Truly enjoyed watching this!!! Very informative and interesting. I hope to visit this castle someday! Every Downton fan should watch!,1363219200,,133,5.7
5526383,4,B00AY2DL78,"Excellent for Downton Abbey fans.  This intimate view of Highclere Castel as presented by its owners, the  eighth Earl and Lady Canarven puts you well into the picture.  You become an instant cogniciente.  Don't miss it!!!",1363219200,,222,5.083333333333333
5526384,3,B00AY2DL78,"This is a beautiful film, but none-the-less it left me somewhat disappointed.  I had ordered it hoping to see the 95 percent or so of the castle and estate that you never see on Downton Abbey.  After watching the DVD, that unseen portion has dropped to maybe 90 percent.  I'm still wondering what nearly all of the rooms in that massive building look like - you only get to see a few that aren't used in the show.  I wonder what relics might lie hidden in the huge, rambling attics and cavernous cellars.  I speculate about the massive brick structure attached to the rear of the castle. Never saw THAT in the TV series!  What the heck's in there?

I wonder if there are any hidden pasageways or secret rooms in the castle?  How on earth do they heat the place and where did the power and water come from before modern utilities? What are some of today's maintenance challenges? Are there still farms on the estate?  What do they grow?

Perhaps the current owners didn't want to have camera crews traipsing over every square inch of their house and property, which I respect.  Still, I had hoped to see more.  I will say that the content, in particular the sweeping aeriel views, still makes the DVD worth owning for fans of the show.",1363132800,265,1234,4.459821428571429

5526438,5,B00AY2DL78,"I enjoyed learning about the past and present of Highclere Castle.  I was very interested to learn of its connection to Ancient Egypt, wartime Europe and the Rockefeller Family. I enjoyed the overview of what the castle is doing now and how they are maintaining it.  I loved hearing of the overall plan for the future.  It is a place I would like to visit someday.  Right now its becoming famous again for its role in Downton Abby but really its whole history is quite fascinating and worth digging into.  I love the stories behind each room and look forward to learning more in the future but for now I will just enjoy the details of the rooms architecture from the Downton Series.",1462838400,,682,4.512195121951219
5526439,5,B00AY2DL78,This was a great documentary made more interesting in that it was narrated by Lord and Lady Carnarvon themselves.  We got peeks of things that were very special about the castle.,1462752000,,178,4.741935483870968

5526441,4,B00AY2DL78,"It is a very well put together overview of another Historical British Property in a small series of such manors.  It covers rather alot for an hour when you consider the family and it's holdings have been around for a mere 4 centuries.  I liked the series (with all the houses) as a whole very well, but I think there is some disappointment because parts of this particular house was used in the filming of Downton Abby and they wanted to see more.

In reality, if you do the tiniest bit of research, you will find there there are many parts of the castle that are simply uninhabitable and possibly unsafe for them to film in.  They did show a bit of this with a few frames from an unused portion of the house.  It wasn't until the filming of Downton that they were able to make some repairs on the place, which is why as the seasons go on you see more and more of the castles.  What I like about this series is that they connect the past of the founding of these houses with the care and upkeep of the manors and families today.

If you are  interested in brief overviews but are looking for something more juicy concerning aristocratic houses and their families, look for documentaries on the Cavendish family with their ""Secrets of Chatsworth""",1462406400,,1246,4.4104803493449785

5526513,4,B00AY2DL78,Viewers learn more about the interior/exterior of the English lord and his family who own this castle that appeared in Downton Abbey. His ancestor is the man who funded the archaeological dig that discovered King Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt. It costs a million dollars to run this estate and it requires good management to keep it running as a business. Don't think that nobility has it easy in today's world!,1456790400,,409,4.857142857142857

5526523,3,B00AY2DL78,"Beautiful scenery; however it was repetitive.  Some shots were used several times over the course of an hour.  Saw very, very little of the castle.  We saw the corner of the kitchen where the stove is, the butler setting the table in the dining room (several times), the smoking room, the library, the ladies sitting room, the grand parlor (several times), and the bedroom where royalty used to stay (several times), as well as the grand staircase and one narrow staircase heading up to a maid's room.  That was it.  Obviously, the family's private quarters are off limits, but I'm assuming there are more than 8 rooms in that castle.",1455667200,,634,4.7272727272727275

Learning the history of the castle and the events that took place there, sheds light on the story-line of many Downtown Abbey episodes. It's truly amazing that a place like this can still exist in today's economy and political environment.. and still be solvent.  The narrator was excellent.",1455580800,,397,4.838235294117647

5526549,4,B00AY2DL78,This is a good background of the castle itself and the real owners of the estate.  I think the title is a little misleading.. I wouldn't necessarily call it 'Secrets...' Maybe a title that speaks to the fact that the 'documentary' goes through some castle history and the current Earl and the happenings around the castle today...maybe more like Highclere castle release life story-yesterday and today... Or something to that effect.  I liked learning a bit more about the setting of one of my favorite TV series.  Worth watching if you are a Downton Abbey fan!,1454198400,,561,4.822916666666667

That's what they get for showing off and stealing from Egypt and other countries. 1 million dollars a year to maintain the house and property? Ridiculous! I say, get rid of it. They seriously could build a whole new town on the land Highclere is sitting on. 5000 acres for one house and two people? What a waste. Also, what was up with the Earl's nose hair and general appearance? Why couldn't he get a hair cut, trim and good suit? With all the money that he has.

5526612,3,B00AY2DL78,"Not surprisingly, it turns out that 'Downton Abbey' really exists, but under a different name - Highclere Castle. The film makes it seem as if the estate is self-sufficient, though no explicit claim to such is made in this film. Turns out predecessors of the Carnarvon family have lived there since 1679, and others lived there in an earlier home for some 800 years before that. The current Highclere Castle contains 5,000 acres of surrounding land, with about 2,000 of that farmed, and another 1,600 or so acres devoted to raising sheep. An Iron Age Hill Fort is also located on the land.

The library has over 5,650 books, dating back to the 16th century. There are 11 bedrooms on the first floor, and 40 - 50 on the next floors - no longer used. Weddings, tours, hunts, and of course filming of Downton Abbey provide income in addition to that obtained by farming. The castle interior includes innumerable incredible paintings and pieces of furniture. Another interesting detail - some of the Downton Abbey episodes reasonably closely followed the history of the castle - eg. used as a hospital for officers wounded during WWI.

Unfortunately, this DVD did not do a particularly good job of covering the basics - eg. total square feet, what the $1 million/year upkeep consists of (eg. how much operations vs. repairs), the number of rooms, how it is heated/cooled, etc. Wasn't spellbinding at all.",1440806400,,1400,4.853556485355648

The bonus in watching this documentary however was in learning that the 6th Earl of Carnarvon, grandfather of the present Earl, discovered the tomb and treasures of Tutankhamun, the Egyptian Pharaoh which he donated to a museum in New York. He did however keep some small items that were discovered in a secret spot in Highclere not too long ago.

I would have liked to have seen more of the rooms that were shown in Downton Abbey such as the bedrooms. I know the kitchen at Highclere has been updated. I would have liked to have seen that. And most of all, more about the grounds and the industries there. Since this program was made, one of the gate houses have been renovated into guest rooms for a bed and breakfast.",1434412800,,548,4.219047619047619

5526765,4,B00AY2DL78,"Many of the reviews around this show talked about the disappointment in not seeing more of the house than is shown on Downton Abbey. While this is mostly true, I found the history of the house and family to be quite worth the watch. I never knew of the connection to King Tut's tomb, for example. The current tenants seem down to earth and actually have something in common with the show in that they care about keeping the castle and grounds going strong for the next generation.

5526774,5,B00AY2DL78,"It was nice to see that the castle is being cared for today so that future generations can see it as well. Like many of the reviewers here, I, too, was hoping to see more of the lesser seen rooms and what the actual downstairs looked like. But I enjoyed seeing what they did show in spite of that.

Probably my only disappointment is the state of the tower, if what was seen there was from today. I'm really hoping that the current Earl will see to the repairs of the tower. I think it's the one place I would be most eager to explore. Well, I'd like to explore the whole place but the tower would be my first expedition. For some reason, it fascinates me.

I also found it interesting that much of the history of the place has been included in episodes of Downton Abbey. The fact that during the war, the castle did, indeed, become a makeshift hospital - operating theater and all.

If you enjoy Downton Abbey, I do recommend watching this as well. While the documentary is light in touring the entire castle, it does show how the estate works today and some of those who make it work. Highly recommended.",1423353600,,1106,4.333333333333333

5526776,5,B00AY2DL78,"A Cultural Trust.  Highclere is a living museum, with English history stretching back hundreds of years.
It is Amazing to know the World War 1 hospital story is true, and the discovery of King Tut was funded by the Earl of Highclere.

What matters most is the preservation of true English culture and English Pride.
People are so down on themselves now-a-days, they must remember that by God,
they're families have survived hundreds of generations from the Ice Age to the modern day!
Englishmen should be very proud of that indeed.

I am surprised the Highclere Castle hasn't been named a National Treasure and supported by the government,
but I would imagine it receives more tender care and thoughtful attention by the family who lives there.

Only one damaged section of the Castle is seen in the video.  Sad to say, from the stories on Highclere's website,
much of the roof was damaged, rain poured into the structure - and for a very old building it suffered much damage
and still requires extensive renovations and repair.  And not to mention the thousands of acres of land that need tending too,
and the farming and animals, and all the outer buildings.  Truly a daunting task - amazing men rebuilding and preserving history for future generations.

I am encouraged that Highclere Castle has many business opportunities.
I imagine it would be wonderful for elite weddings and wedding receptions, quite romantic!
An amazing story - unique and worth preserving.",1421884800,,1466,4.930894308943089

It is easy to forget when watching the show what a huge job it is to keep up a historic building like Highclere.  It was really interesting to see the present Lord and Lady Canervon. Loved seeing the rooms and hear about how the estate is run today. If you are a Downton fan, this is the next best thing to going on a tour.
The present Lady Canervon has written two books about two of the past Lady Canervon's. As an author I look forward to reading them.

5526835,3,B00AY2DL78,"Although I loved the background information on the castle used in the Dontown Abbey series, I think it could have been more in depth. Just seemed a too superficial.

Anyone who is in love with that show will love this show.  It takes you not just through the castle's history but the people's longstanding pride and heritage. They are so proud of their history and traditions that even generations of the service people are still proudly working (or should i say ""serving"") at Highclere.

England and also shows how much care was taken of furniture and ornaments etc.

It provides background information about the family who live at Highclere and some of the details of how the tv show imitates real life and real history, especially how life for the aristocracy changed after World War I.  You do get to see some of the other rooms of the castle not shown in Downton, and you meet some of the staff who work there now.

I am not a TV an, but I have watched PBS since I was 8 years old and I retire this month.  So, I think this is a first for me...to turn off PBS for lack of I interest.

It does have English subtitles, which is good.",1394064000,3,406,4.652777777777778
5526977,5,B00AY2DL78,This is a good documentary about the running of the home from Downton Abbey.  It is remarkable that the house has stood the test of time and is available for people to visit.  The house itself is remarkable.  The grounds on the outside are awesome and did not realize how large they were.  Definitely worth the time to view if you are interested in the series.,1394064000,,360,4.409090909090909

But I discovered that I kind of regretted the purchase, feeling that, unlike ""Downton,"" it's nothing I wish to watch again and again.

5526994,5,B00AY2DL78,"This is a history of the Castle going back to the first Earl who built the castle.  It gives the history of the different Earls and the current Earl and Duchess who live there.  Because of the age of the castle, repairs were numerous, the series Downton Abbey has been a way to restore the 300 year old castle to its grand appearance when it was first build.  It is a working farm and the Earl and Duchess are restoring it to its former beauty for future generations.  I showed this video to a very good friend of mine who is originally from England and she loved the history of it.  She is an avid viewer of Downton Abbey so I knew she would enjoy it.

5526998,5,B00AY2DL78,It is amazing to me to see how the castle developed from a manor home to a castle over the years.  It is hard to fathom the wealth that is needed to sustain such a beautiful place.  It was interesting to listen to the current Lord and Lady and what they have to do to keep the castle going.  They seem very humble about their responsibility to do whatever they can to keep the castle running.  I enjoyed listening to the butler and how he wants to keep up with the formal ways.  It is a beautiful estate and wonderful to see the castle inside and out and to feel that it is still a home.  They are fortunate that Downton Abbey is filmed there to help defray some of the expenses. Highclere Castle is a special place.,1393113600,,716,4.1521739130434785

I would have loved to see more of it, some of the never before seen rooms.",1391990400,,147,4.285714285714286
5527017,4,B00AY2DL78,Watched this because I am addicted to dowton abbey. Was interested to see more of the property where it is filmed. Would loved to have seen more of the interior of the castle.,1391904000,,175,4.333333333333333
5527018,4,B00AY2DL78,"Gorgeous scenery and what a spectacular ""house""!! The current earl and his countess seem very down-to-earth. I wish they had given more detail--for example, how many rooms are there? What does the utilities expense average? Do they function as a hotel when the series isn't being filmed? Spoiler--""Downton Abbey"" is mentioned many times!! :)",1391904000,,341,5.333333333333333
5527019,5,B00AY2DL78,A wonderful and enlightening exploration of a very identifiable yet little-known house.  It is with great pleasure I say...WATCH!  Watch all episodes in this series!,1391817600,,165,5.56
5527020,5,B00AY2DL78,"If you're in to Downton Abby, like I am, this is a very good book! The every day lives of the people who lived there were so much more interesting than I thought they'd be. I recommend.",1391731200,,185,4.027027027027027
5527021,5,B00AY2DL78,"This DVD was a wonderful expansion of Downton Abbey's (Highclere Castle) shooting site - at least for the Crawley Families living areas!  The ""real info"" about it's life and origin were fascinating, and a better view of the life and history of the building.",1391731200,,257,4.840909090909091
5527022,4,B00AY2DL78,"Chose this video because I am a Downton Abbey fan. Found the film thoughtful, informative and well done. Gave background and current issues facing the castle. Photography is great.",1391731200,,180,5.241379310344827
5527023,5,B00AY2DL78,"Great job showing the property and describing what's necessary to maintain it and pay for the maintenance.  The castles are much like the art in Florence, Italy - there's so much of it and not enough money to save it all.",1391558400,,221,4.390243902439025
5527024,5,B00AY2DL78,"I don't care for the show Downton Abbey...However when I see how it has saved/restored this beautiful castle and it's grounds, I will watch it just to support Highclere Castle.  God bless the feudal way of life!!!  LOL!!",1391472000,,220,4.7631578947368425
5527025,5,B00AY2DL78,Lovely to see behind the scenes at this wonderful castle. Just like watching the TV series and some of the storylines match what really happened here. Enjoyed it a lot.,1391472000,,168,4.633333333333334
5527026,5,B00AY2DL78,Cool and very informative description of who lives in the fictional downtown abbey real house. Nice shots of the inside of the house and secrets I didn't know.,1391385600,,159,4.714285714285714
5527027,5,B00AY2DL78,"This was an extraordinary eye opener of the real castle where our beloved characters work.  It puts you in the castle and explains where they are and how history puts them there, great!",1391385600,,185,4.606060606060606
5527028,2,B00AY2DL78,"This would be a one-star rating except it was so unintentionally hilarious. The castle itself is obviously gorgeous and fascinating. But rather than concentrate on the history and architecture of the building and grounds, they let the people who currently live there take over the show, and that is unfortunate. They are kind of creepy and very pretentious. It made me feel somewhat dirty every time they interviewed the earl, and his wife did not come across as very intelligent. Overall, pretty disappointing, especially once I saw that it was produced by PBS.",1391299200,2,562,5.053763440860215
5527029,5,B00AY2DL78,"This is a wonderful documentary, a real must-see for Downton Abbey fans.  Actually, anyone with an interest in English history would be well-advised to view this video!",1391212800,,168,5.222222222222222
5527030,1,B00AY2DL78,This show was very boring. It lost my attention.  All I can suggest is to make it more interesting in how it is presented.,1391126400,,122,4.083333333333333
5527031,5,B00AY2DL78,I learned a lot about the Castle---makes watching Downton Abbey even more fun----the current Lord is a very sweet guy it would seem and cares a lot about the building and grounds,1391126400,,178,4.59375
5527032,5,B00AY2DL78,Very interesting and well done. This is a must see for Downton Abby lovers. Lots of details and great history stories.,1391126400,,118,4.666666666666667
5527033,4,B00AY2DL78,"If you love Downton Abbey, you must watch this. Very interesting. I had no idea that the castle actually existed and has a current lord and lady living there.",1391040000,,158,4.482758620689655
5527034,5,B00AY2DL78,Well done documentary worth watching for fans and for those ignorant of the series. Looking forward to visiting someday and hoping they are able to maintain this wonderful piece of history and architecture in all its splendor.,1390953600,,226,5.135135135135135
5527035,3,B00AY2DL78,"I've always heard British food could be boring and all the jokes about bad teeth, but is untamed nasal hair a thing too? Yes, the castle is beautiful, but I couldn't get past the gloriously long hairs coming out of the 8th Earl of Carnarvon, George Herbert's nose. Having noticed the butler stick on Downton Abbey, I wondered why there isn't one for nose hair.
My recommendation: If you're a fan of the show, you will probably like this...but...watch from a distance on your TV...not on your computer.",1390953600,,501,4.704545454545454
5527036,5,B00AY2DL78,"If haven't watched Downton Abbey yet, read this book. Great read for book clubs .Novel based on history. You won't be able to put it down",1390953600,,137,4.3076923076923075

5527038,4,B00AY2DL78,"A very colorful overview of the castle and its history. Blends in well with the current interest in the series Downton Abby.
Not overly didactic; like a mini-tour of the castle.",1390867200,,177,4.741935483870968
5527039,5,B00AY2DL78,It was so interesting to learn about the real Highclere Castle and how they function on a day to day basis.,1390867200,,107,4.142857142857143
5527040,4,B00AY2DL78,"Four stars, because it was interesting and who doesn't like an inside look?  But if it's called ""Secrets,"" I think there has to be a little more to it.  Not too many secrets revealed here.  Still, it's worth watching it if for no other reason than to see who lives there now.",1390867200,,275,4.25
5527041,5,B00AY2DL78,I watched Secrets of Highclere after I watched the first three seasons of Downton Abbey. It was very interesting to learn that this home was owned by the relatives of Lord Carnovan who was with Carter when the tomb of King Tut was discovered. The rooms that were shown were those featured in the TV series. I am glad that I watched after I caight up. I definitely would tour the abbey if I were going to England.,1390867200,,412,4.294871794871795
5527042,4,B00AY2DL78,Enjoyed seeing behind the scenes.  Quite an interesting place.  This period in history is very fascinating.  Would be interested in more behind the scenes stories.,1390867200,,163,5.44
5527043,4,B00AY2DL78,I found this to be interesting without going into so much detail as to be a history lecture. I enjoyed seeing the inner workings of the castle and learning how the family made money for upkeep. Worth a watch.,1390521600,,208,4.358974358974359
5527044,4,B00AY2DL78,Very interesting look at the real people behind the Highclere Castle. This is a well made documentary that will appeal to anyone who enjoys English architecture.,1390521600,,161,5.230769230769231
5527045,3,B00AY2DL78,"I was expecting more of the Downton environment in this DVD, but was surprised to see little of it.

The current Earl and his wife were nice and friendly and the DVD told of the many activities that occur there, so that was fine with me.

I would only recommend this set if you want to collect all things Downton.",1390435200,,313,4.2
5527046,4,B00AY2DL78,"Interesting graphics, applicable to Dontown Abbey program.  Gives one a view of so-called ""upper crust"" life and the changes the world wars brought.",1390435200,,148,5.434782608695652
5527047,5,B00AY2DL78,"It was fascinating to see the castle and hear the history, and how difficult it is to operate a property of that size. And, how difficult it was to operate it decades ago.

Thank you,

Bob Hogan",1390435200,,194,4.216216216216216
5527048,5,B00AY2DL78,I have been to England twice especially loved the countryside.  It is great to know that this castle is still standing and being repaired instead of destroyed. I guess I thought there would be more people to take care of the Castle. It was fun to watch and if I visit England again I would love to see the Castle.  It is nice see that they are opening up the Castle so the rest of us can enjoy the beauty of it. Sometimes we forget how much it takes for upkeep. It is beautiful.  Thanks for sharing it with us.,1390348800,,510,4.08
5527049,5,B00AY2DL78,"This was clearly an expose trying to justify the lifestyles of the rich and famous who did nothing to deserve their riches and fame. It was lovely and presented the castle with breathtaking photography, but all in all, it made me pretty queasy. The lord and lady seemed very nice, but dedicating your life and efforts to support a lifestyle and residence that is not thoroughly justifiable, isn't a comfortable effort. Yuck . . . pretty much . . . not the documentary so much as the lifestyle.",1390348800,,493,4.613636363636363
5527050,5,B00AY2DL78,"It was refreshing to see that pretty ""everyday"" people actually live in this castle.  It is their life and their business---with the same challenges as any business.  Really interesting documentary.",1390348800,,198,5.566666666666666

5527052,5,B00AY2DL78,"I thought the documentary on Highclere Castle was illuminating and a very good accompaniment to the marvelous TV series.

5527056,4,B00AY2DL78,It was great to see castle for what it really is. It was also a great history lesson of the people who have reside in it.,1390089600,,121,3.6923076923076925
5527057,2,B00AY2DL78,"If you are a Downton fan, there really aren't many secrets revealed here. The King Tut tomb replicas in the basement and the story of the Canarvon connection is interesting.",1390089600,,173,4.8

5527060,4,B00AY2DL78,"Since my family heritage is the Spencer Estate at Althrop (which PBS covered in an excellent documentary interviewing the current Earl Charles Spencer.. and Princess Diana's brother).. I was anxious to see this documentary only to get a look warm response.  You do not get to see much more of the estate then you do on Downton.. The documentary is short and concise but not as interesting in my opinion then the other PBS documentaries such as Althrop discussing the family ties of the Spencer and Washingtons.. or The doc on Windsor Castle.

I feel they could have investigated further Highclere.. and shown a great deal more of the estate.  However I'm sure if you love Downton Abbey you'll at least want to watch this documentary.",1389830400,,733,4.801587301587301
5527061,5,B00AY2DL78,"Like millions of Americans, I am an avid fan of the British period drama, Downton Abby.  I don't watch television (and don't have TV service) but got hooked on Downton via Amazon Prime and my computer a couple of months before Season 3 aired in the US in early 2013.  So hooked that I paid to purchase a download of Season 3 from Amazon Prime.  Since then, I've installed a Roku media streaming device mainly so I can watch the Downton Season 4 episodes the day after they air on PBS.  (The bonus of my Roku is access to a gazillion previously aired PBS programs whenever I want to watch them.)  I cannot recommend ""Secrets of Highclere Castle"" more highly for Downton fans.  The current lord and lady of this very real British country estate are warm and delightful as they describe the deplorable condition of much of their estate before revenue from Downton rode to the rescue and how grateful they are to Downton's writer, cast and fans for making the refurbishing of Highclere Castle possible.",1389830400,,998,4.610169491525424

5527065,4,B00AY2DL78,It is so inspiring to see the present-day noble family maintaining the legacy of Highclere Castle.  They have done such a marvelous job of preserving the past while bringing the ancestral home and lands into the present century.,1389744000,,228,5.0

The mere size of the well-tended grounds, and the opulent interior largely unchanged since Lady Almina's day harken back to a time in history that shall never be again.

5527098,4,B00AY2DL78,"I really enjoyed seeing the history of the estate. Well worth watching if you like Downton Abbey, and still interesting if you are interested in historical buildings. There are parts of the castle not seen in the show, and it was interesting to see them, as well as to ""meet"" the real family that lives there.",1388793600,,309,4.535714285714286
5527099,5,B00AY2DL78,"As another Downton Abbey fan I found this, non-fictional, information to be as fascinating as the fictional story!

I am thrilled that the current 'protectors' of Highclere are doing all that they can to to ensure that this wonderful landmark and it's most important traditions endure.",1388620800,,285,5.195652173913044

5527101,5,B00AY2DL78,"O.k., I first admit to being a Downton addict.  I also live the history of places and buildings and this one was so much more than I expected.  I am amazed that the family has been able to keep this castle and most of the land intact.  The link to King Tut was a fun unexpected fact.  Great job",1388620800,,294,3.9322033898305087

5527103,4,B00AY2DL78,"This documentary covers the history of the 300-year old Highclere Castle and a glimpse into a few more rooms that you usually see in the Downton Abbey series. Featuring interviews with the current owners, Lord and Lady Carnarvan, we hear about the challenges of managing such a fine estate, which has a budget of >$1M per year. We also meet the current chef in his modern kitchen (the kitchens used in Downton Abbey are actually a set - not located in the Castle). I would liked to have seen more of the rooms that are NOT featured in the series - how they are decorated, what are the servants rooms used for now, how does the family really live in such grand rooms - what does their ""family room"" with flat screen tv and DVD player and laptop computer look like :)  It was definitely interesting, but left me wanting to know more. I hope to have time to visit the Castle next time we visit London.",1388534400,,898,4.377245508982036

But, having heard rave reviews for the ""Downton"" show and having watched it a few times, this video caught my attention.  I'm on who always wants to see the far corners of a large home to see what's hiding there.  While this video didn't get as far back into the corners as I would have liked, it made a decent attempt and I rated it a 4 star.",1388188800,,417,3.9404761904761907

5527114,4,B00AY2DL78,"The third season is good but I find the character standards of the patriarch is becoming disconcerting for the time period.  The character Ethel is denigrated even when trying to help her yet the footman/butler, homosexual, liar, and schemer is placed in a higher position making the series look as if it is taking on 21st century political agenda. This could be the downfall of an otherwise good period piece.  We've seen that happen just recently on a very popular modernTV program which I do not watch. As it comes to find out the creator/producer was in a gay porn movie called ""The Fluffer"" and did not like what one of the stars said on his own time and removed him from the scheduled filming.  BE CARE producers, writers of Downton you may find your views fleeing should you continue today's political agenda in a period piece not suited to it. I have dropped my ratings for this season to four because of the above stated reasons",1388016000,2,937,4.598802395209581

5527116,3,B00AY2DL78,"Gorgeous panoramic views of an enormous estate.  Lots of history and behind the scenes of what it takes to manage a place so large.  It's interesting, but we would be better served to see this without the current earl and his wife. They're boring.",1387670400,4,247,4.590909090909091
5527117,5,B00AY2DL78,Secrets of Highclere Castle revealed and it is interesting to see actors and actresses  and owners explore and explain the castle.

Although there aren't too many secrets spilled it is fun to see how the modern family lives in 19th century splendor and manages to keep the estate relevant in today's economy.  Worth watching, and glad to see that although many such estates did not survive, HIghclere Castle still triumphs..",1387238400,,336,4.982142857142857
5527120,5,B00AY2DL78,"What a story.  Makes you wonder how some can have so much that they can't use it.  I was pleased it was used for so many movies as I wondered, too, how do they set up a studio so beautiful and keep a budget for the program.  Good history.",1387238400,,238,3.816326530612245

5527122,4,B00AY2DL78,I found this interesting.  I also found it hard to believe that they did not have a clue as to the Tut items hidden in the castle.  I liked the fact that the estate is supporting itself with the help of the filming of Downton Abbey at the castle.  I also found it interesting that many of the items seen on the show are actually pieces belonging to the castle.,1386806400,3,360,4.114285714285714

Some additional information on overall size, number of bedrooms, etc would have been nice. Also more info on how often each room would have been used during the peak of the house's use. Were there entire wings not touched until there was a big party? Or was most of the house in fairly regular use? Stuff like that would have been nice. But overall I found it very informative and quite interesting. I am very happy to see that the TV show and associated fame has provided the revenue to allow this piece of history to continue well into the future.",1383436800,,678,4.388888888888889

Fascinating----would appear like living in a fairy tale, when in reality there is a lot of work and planning necessary to keep things running, as evidenced by the demolition of similar properties in the area.

Its nice to watch some totally different then what normal on tv. I used to think how much simpler it was back then in reality it wasn't, they just showed a little more respect back then which I think we need more of today.

The ""Secrets of Highclere Castle"" is another extremely interesting documentary of the history of this famous castle located 90 miles southwest of London.  Highclere Castle for over 300 years has been the home of the Carnarvans.  The most famous of the Carnarvan Dynasty was Lord Carnarvan of the 1920's who was the backer and financier of the famous archeological find in history, that of the Ancient Pharaoh Tutankhamun.  Today, the claim to fame of this castle is that it is the castle of ""Downton Abbey"", the great series on PBS.  The documentary tells the fascinating story of how it was built in the 1600's and for over 300 years it was the ""playground"" of the rich and famous of Great Britain.  King George V stayed here a few times and was entertained and dined.  The bill for that weekend alone came to over $500,000 dollars in today's exchange!  When Highclere Castel was the social scene Lady and Lord Carnarvan had a wait staff of over 60 men and women.
Today, this beautiful castle is lovignly cared for by the present Lord and Lady Carnarvan who spend over $1 Million annually for its preservation and upkeep.  Thankfully, do to the popularity of the series ""Downton Abbey"" it has become a major tourist destination and receives a generous amount of money from the tours of the castle, what PBS/BBC pays to rent this castle for the series ""Downton Abbey"", and a number of social events.  In this documentary, you see the beautiful rooms, dining halls, bedrooms, and private family rooms.  Interesting interviews with the gameskeeper who tells of the famous hunting enjoyed by King George V who hunted on the estate for pheasant, doves, and deer.  The estate is still hunted on today, but nothing compared to a hundered years ago.  The chefs of Highclere tell the story of the meals that were served during its heyday and what is being served today.  Lord Carnarvan gives a tour of the estate which is very large, and he shows the grave of his great grandfather, the famous Lord Carnarvan who funded the King Tutankhamun dig.  This is an outstanding DVD of an outstanding series that shows the beautfiul manors, palaces, and castles of Great Britain.  It is a documentary that is worth watching over again and in years to come.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377648000,94,2348,4.786600496277916

5527184,3,B00AY2DL78,"Actually, this was an interesting but not really relevant reveal of the castle in which Downton Abby is filmed. It is always like pulling back a blanket when the English aristocracy is opened up to Americans. They are a mystery to us. Perhaps the most interesting part was the back story on Lord Carnivon who discovered King Tut's tomb. He was a previous inhabitant and ancestor of the current inhabitant. Also of interest is that this is one of the few castles that are still extant following changes in taxing and so forth. The filming of the show is one of the many ways that the Lord of the castle keeps revenue up to maintain and manage the estate.",1376784000,3,653,4.495798319327731

8558976,5,B00AY2DL78,"You don't have to be a ""Downton Abbey"" fan to appreciate Highclere Castle's beauty. The state rooms open to the public are very beautiful. We get to see a little more of the mansion than rooms on tour, but not a lot. The 8th Earl of Carnarvon does take us to the Smoking Room, usually ""strictly for family eyes only."" It is a peach-walled refuge with family photos topping every surface and well-worn leather furniture.

It would have been nice to see more of the rooms. Highclere was one of the first estates to get electricity, and the butler shows us the updated bell board put in when it did. Instead of bells, each room has a light. The rooms have names like Star Chamber Bedroom, Wessex Bathroom and East Anglia Dressing Room. What might they look like?

It could be that they simply ran out of time and couldn't show us everything. Because this tour of Highclere includes includes conversations with kitchen staff and outdoor managers. The head gamekeeper, for example, shows us photos from when the Prince of Wales joined a hunting party around 1904: ""They shot 1,600 pheasants here in three-quarters of an hour.""

We also get to get a glimpse of some Egyptian memorabilia, for the Earl's ancestor was the man who funded the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb. As a special treat, as it's also off-limits to tourists, we get to see the current Earl's special Egyptian room. He has had recreations made of some of the tomb's treasures, including King Tut's amazing death mask. (The original is in Egypt.)

Commentators include George Herbert (8th Earl of Carnarvon), Fiona Herbert (8th Countess), Colin Edwards (Butler, Highclere), Robert Hawker (deer manager), Eddie Hughes (head gamekeeper), Tom Hibberd (underkeeper), Paul (head chef) and Rob (sous chef).

The show originally aired in 2012 and is 56 minutes in length. If you purchase it on disc, English subtitles are available. There are no bonus features on the disc. ""The Secrets of Highclere Castle"" is just one in a series. Five of the series' episodes can be purchased in a 5-DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Iconic-British-Estates/dp/B00KX44RNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Iconic British Estates</a>.
