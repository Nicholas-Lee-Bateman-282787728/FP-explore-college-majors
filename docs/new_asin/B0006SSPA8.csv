8042817,5,B0006SSPA8,"This is one of those reviews where I feel kind of limited in what I can say about the movie itself because I don't want to give anything away.

But it does have suspense, great characters, a good storyline and never succumbs to a common flaw of many modern horror movies. Far too many horror movies these days try to explain the mysterious elements of their stories but fail to provide an explanation that makes sense. The element of mystery is usually scarier anyway. We know that there's supernatural elements, and how they work as much as is necessary. It doesn't matter that we don't know why they work they way they do or how they came to be.

The bad? Well nothing serious; the only minor problem is that a couple of times things we learn could have been more effective if they'd been delayed slightly.

It had actually been about sixteen months since I last saw this flick and I forgot how great it is.",1260057600,,909,4.431137724550898
8042818,3,B0006SSPA8,"The Locals (Greg Page, 2003)

Every once in a while there's a scene in a movie that really affects my rating, even though what catches me has absolutely nothing to do with the movie in any way; it's just some tossed-off comment or other that gives me another view of a different culture or what have you. There's a great scene like that in New Zealand filmmaker Greg Page's amusing supernatural comedy/drama/thriller The Locals; the two main characters, Grant (John Barker, from Eddie's Million-Dollar Cook-Off) and Paul (The Tribe's Dwayne Cameron), are talking about the former's recent breakup. Grant dances around the subject for a while, but finally reveals that his girlfriend broke up with him because he didn't like The Lord of the Rings (the movies, not the book). Paul scoffs in disbelief, not that his girlfriend did such a silly thing, but that Grant didn't like The Lord of the Rings. I was momentarily amused and ready to write the whole thing off and go on to the next scene, but then I thought about it a little more, and realized that in New Zealand, that might actually be a valid reason for breaking up with someone. After all, Peter Jackson's vast, sweeping magnum opus is not only three very pretty films in New Zealand; for a number of years, it was a very large part of the island's economy, as well as being a paycheck for a large number of New Zealand actors and actresses (including more than one of Cameron's costars from The Tribe). So, yeah, in America, it;s the equivalent of dissing General Motors, not because you have some major ideological claim against them, but because their cars just don't excite you all that much. So I had this minor, but noticeable, shift in cultural consciousness while watching the film that I don't really expect anyone else to get while watching it, and that probably throws off my rating, but so be it. I love little epiphanies like that, and am more than willing to give credit where credit is due. (It also helps this movie that I'm a slavish Tribe fan, and so Dwayne Cameron in anything will up its stock for me automatically.)

The plot: Grant and Paul head out to the coast to do some surfing in order to take Grant's mind off his recent breakup. The two of them get lost, however, and end up on a dead-end road in the middle of nowhere. All well and good, time to turn around and find the highway again, except that two lovely young things, Kelly (30 Days of Night's Kate Elliott) and Lisa (Aidee Walker from the upcoming Drop Dead Gorgeous in her first big-screen appearance), come along all decked out in eighties finery and invite our boys to a nearby party. Just the thing, but while Grant and Paul are following the ladies, they almost get sideswiped by a crazy driver and end up in a ditch. They head off to look for some help, but stumble upon a farmer slitting his wife's throat. He sees them, and the bulk of the rest of the movie has Grant and Paul trying to evade a posse of local vigilantes who want to make sure the secret stays buried. That, however, is only the tip of this particular weird iceberg...

No, I know what I just described does not sound like a comedy/drama kind of thing, but while I'm sure this was originally marketed as a thriller, it just doesn't feel like one. Yes, sure, there are car chases and people chasing other people with big knives and stuff that blows up, but you should realize pretty early on that not all is as it seems here, and there's a greater mystery underlying it all. That (as well as a growing relationship between Paul and Lisa as the two sets of friends bump into one another again and again over the course of the evening) quickly becomes the focus here. I know I should probably be castigating Page for not being able to keep all these eggs in one hat successfully, but as a mystery picture, with the exception of some silliness in the final few minutes that tears a huge hole in the entire plot, it works relatively well once Page starts throwing curve balls at your head. As well, the main characters are quite well-written, as are some of the supporting characters, which makes it easier for the audience to get more involved with this thing than they otherwise would. Not a bad little movie at all this, though you should go in with no expectations as to what you're getting; it's much more fun that way. Needless to say, as well, it's a must for Tribe fans. ***",1259539200,,4394,4.503759398496241
8042819,1,B0006SSPA8,"The word on this film was positive, but the film is a negative. Confusing goings-on with a clunk of an ending. This one goes straight to resale after a boring and laborious one- time viewing  . A NZ flopper!",1254182400,,207,4.3076923076923075
8042820,5,B0006SSPA8,"Have you ever watched a movie and then just sat there and thought, WOW!! THAT WAS AWESOME!! Well, THE LOCALS is that kind of movie.

THE LOCALS is an amazing film on so many levels. This was my first dip into a New Zealand horror film and oh, what a ride!! Another amazing fact, this was writer/director Greg Page's debut feature film--the man has mondo talent--Hollywood should take notes!

I slipped onto THE LOCALS by accident. I was skimming through the horror titles and for some reason, it caught my eye. Thank the lucky stars it did. The plot starts off simple enough--Grant has been dumped by his girlfriend so his best friend Paul convinces him to go on a surfing weekend. They meet some girls who invite them to a party, but unfortunately they have an auto mishap with a ditch. Don't cha just hate it when that happens? I know I do, especially when it's late at nite and I'm on a dark deserted road. The boys take off down a dirt road to try and find help, instead, they find trouble. While peering in a window, they witness a farmer murdering his wife. Unfortunately for them, he sees them also.

Now, I know that you probably think that you know how the story ends. I know I did. I was wrong. THE LOCALS has more twists and turns than you can imagine. The story was fresh with a supernatural element. The gore factor was surprisingly limited, but there was such an atmosphere of evil and the potential for violence, I held my breath through most of the film, just waiting for the axe to fall. And the bonus was I actually cared for the characters, I was rooting for them. I can't tell you the last time I actually felt that way about  horror film characters.

So, give THE LOCALS a chance. Add them to your horror collection and I think you'll agree--this is an instant modern horror classic. An amazing piece of film. I can't wait to see what GREG PAGE does next for an encore.

BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!",1183766400,3,1910,4.396600566572238
8042821,4,B0006SSPA8,"Mention New Zealand horror movies to most people and you will probably get one name thrown at you-Peter Jackson ,whose early movies were vigorous and gore drenched tales marked by frequent gross outs and a deft line in mordaunt humour .
Now ,here is another tale from the twin island state and while its no masterpiece it is well made and never dull. It starts as if we are going to get another variant on the city boys trappped in a bucolic hellhole theme ,when two young male friends setting out for a weekend of sun and surf are stranded in the back of beyond .They witness what appears to be a murder and set out to escape from the killer and his circle of distinctly weird associates .However all is not as it seems -a cyclic pattern is being worked out here ,and it involves two youung women ,a land dispute and a race against time if they are to escape with their lives and identities intact .

The plot twist -and it would be unfair to reveal details -is neatly worked out and ,even allowing for a shoestring budget the production values are pretty fair ,especially the limpid colour photography .Nicely if unexceptionally acted and well written ,with an attention to characterisation rare in low budget horror movies ,this repays attention from those looking for new names and locales in the genre",1182816000,5,1306,4.581196581196581
8042822,4,B0006SSPA8,"I'd grown up with horror movies, not only off course, but fell in love with the genre early on. We had lots of fun sessions and most of those horror movie somehow spread that joy the makers must have had during the making. We did that ourselves and really had pure fun times filming monsters and gore stuff. Now there's this new horror film generation in my opinion just as SAW, CREEP, the remake of the CHAINSAW MASSACRE and the latter shows best what I wanna say: take the original and watch the remake afterwards and the point is obvious: there's A LOT more sadism to the new kind of horror movies. While the title and the story of the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is by far the most horrifying part of the movie (you never really see dismemberments or killings, it is the most terrifying but least graphic movie) in the remake it is all shown to you: one guy gets hooked up painfully in the neck, both legs get graphically dismembered, the guy stays alive as long as one can imagine. Same goes for CREEP in my opinion. The brutality is just A LOT more graphic these days than ever before while I truly find that the tense isn't so much influenced by it in an all too positive way. Don't get me wrong: I own the Peter Jackson Splatterfests (bad taste, braindead, meet..., even Heavenly cr.), I'm a big fan of ICHI THE KILLER, but with both there's something more to it. In ICHI the violence has a clear purpose that most would never recognise. You can replace the violence and sadism by love (which has violence and sadism to it naturally) and understand the whole movie differently, but the contents will remain the same. With the Jackson Splatter movies, there's a lot of humour and downright overthetop-stuff that is shown to you so uncompromising you can only laugh.

I'm saying this all for one reason: the locals goes back to the old-school-horror feeling. The movie is not really hard in terms of violence and gore and there are some mediocre clichees to it to begin with. The ending turns out to be a bit over-dramatically performed but satisfies nevertheless, a different climax for once. But regarding the many flaws of the general horror flick, this one is on the good side for sure.

THE LOCALS starts quiet similiar like JEEPERS CREEPERS: two buddies are on a surf-trip somewhere and meet two pretty ladies during the search who are looking for a party that should take place nearby. They follow them at hi-speed, but due to an accident get off the way and cannot bring the car back on the street. Their search for help (it's night... it's deserted...) brings them to a farmer house where they witness something very ungood. The less you know, the better it is. I always like the idea of deserted towns, buildings etc., and while they're doing what people should do in those situations (that is running, hiding, praying...) they find all of the local buildings to be deserted and messed up, although the locals themselves are not absent. The answer to the question is nothing all too original. But if you're into simple horror movies like Jeepers Creepers and others, you should check this one out.

I've seen better movies indeed. I'm more into this kind of horror movies while the texas chainsaw massacre, creep and saw is much more of an extremly sadistic apporach to the genre. I could've stomached a lot more gore and blood for sure with the locals, but it wasn't necessary and gave me just enough creeps to be satisfied.",1137110400,11,3446,4.6
8042823,3,B0006SSPA8,"Reading the synopsis and reviews for this film I thought it would remind ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Wrong Turn"" or something like that. But it appeared that the movie was totally different. I can't say whether it is good or bad but after the usual beginning (rural area trip, broken car, crime witnessing, cat and mouse chasing) a couple of surprises happened to be ahead. I won't speak of them not to ruin everything but I must say those surprises were not enough for me to give this movie more stars. Everything seemed to be at place but the whole picture looked a little immature. Besides I didn't actually like the acting which could be a lot better. Well after considering the fact that it's an indie from New Zealand made by a newcomer director I have to say it's a nice start. The thing I liked was the cinematographer's work - he did a great job - and everything concerning the technical aspects were just fine.

Comparing ""The Locals"" to the other films of the genre I must say that this flick would be interesting I guess only for horror buffs who want something new and fresh, something from afar. But if you just want to kill time watching something, don't bother with this one, watch something else.",1129161600,3,1213,4.564220183486238
8042824,4,B0006SSPA8,"nothing much to add, it was just a good movie, that is worth watching. It keeps you on the edge of the seat, with a some good twists.",1124928000,3,133,3.7857142857142856
8042825,4,B0006SSPA8,"I had low expectations for this one, rented it on a whim having never heard of it before. Turned out to be a really good movie. I thought they did an excellent job building and keeping the tension. Although it is billed as a horror flick, I found it to be more of a suspense movie. It took me half way through the movie to final ""get it"" as to what was going on. I thought they did an excellent job of giving clues, but making it more obvious as things progressed. If I watched it again I'm guessing I would notice things that I missed the first time since I did not know the secret.

The acting was nothing to rave about, somewhat clunky at times, but the plot was so good it was easy to forgive. Most of the movie takes place at night, but they must have had some powerful lights as the places where the characters were tended to be extremely well lit. An odd effect, but I liked it since you could tell what was going on instead of some horror movies where things get too dark and you have to guess what's happening.

As an odd aside, I believe the director, Greg Page, is one of the Wiggles.",1124755200,8,1095,4.11214953271028
8042826,4,B0006SSPA8,"I had no idea what to expect when I hired this DVD, nor did I have any idea it was a New Zuland film. Usually when I hear fellow Australian voices I expect the movie to be crap with unnecessary lines and catch phrases that no one for real would use if if they where as dry as a dead dingos donga. However, this movie contains none of that which was the first breath of fresh air, finally an Australian/New Zealand movie where they act like normal every day Aussies/Kiwis.

The plot is about 2 friends who are heading for the beach for the weekend to go surfing. (There excessive use of the words Man and Dude are overdone, but that really is how a lot of Kiwis speak!) But they never make it to their destination. They are sidetracked out in a country town when they decide to follow some babes they just met heading to a party and while these two horn bags are chasing the girls in there car, another car comes out of nowhere and knocks them off the road into a ditch. With a phone out of service range and unable to find anything to help get them out of the ditch, they decide to go ask a local farmer for assistance. But then the S### hits the fan when they see what they see in the farmers house, and it seems that farmer and the whole town are chasing after the two friends. The race for survival is on to save there own necks, but being separated doesn't help.

Along the way more characters are introduced and things all tie in together at the end when the big mystery is revealed. I actually picked up on it about halfway through, but there is still another mystery at the end that reminds me of the Sixth Sense or The Others.

Overall it is an interesting movie. I like the way that it is set at nighttime, however everything is lit up so it's visible. It's an interesting idea that does work and hopefully will be seen more again in other movies. Things tie in well, a few answers are left un-solved or un-answered, but over all I'd recommend it to those who like the movies I mentioned before.

Give it a rent and see if you liked it like I did.

The bonus features are forgettable. There's a trailer (zzzz) a featurette (zzz) some video clips (if you like the bands) and audio commentary (didnt listen to it) and filmography's and pictures. I didn't find anything special in the bonus stuff, but the movie is a 4 star thriller.",1119312000,3,2339,4.259009009009009
