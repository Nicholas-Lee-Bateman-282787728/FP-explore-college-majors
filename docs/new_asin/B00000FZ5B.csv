1212206,1,B00000FZ5B,"I was a little kid when I first saw the promotional poster for Wes Craven's sophomore horror film outing ""The Hills Have Eyes"", and it scared me sleepless. Years later, as a still-squeamish adolescent, I saw in TV Guide that the movie would be appearing late-night, and got a nasty chill.
I think it must have been the title, which is creepy and evocative: ""The Hills have Eyes""---and then you have one of the old promotional posters, which featured a drawing of a vulnerable looking trailer-home parked out on a desert playa, surrounded by spooky, lumpish hills. It's night, of course, and the name of the movie was splashed across the poster in a font that seemed to promise horror, decency under siege, sheer terror.
And then, until I was 21, I forgot all about the movie. That is, until I saw ""Evil Dead"", with its cellar poster homage to ""Hills"", and, by that time having developed into an experienced gorehound with a taste for the sick and deranged, I thought ""hey, maybe I should see the movie.""  But even then, it wasn't until nearly a decade later that I saw ""Hills"", when it ran on IFC during a particularly stormy New York weekend.
Just like the poster advertised, it's about a decent all-American family whose anniversary/vacation goes awry when Dad takes a *really* wrong turn and drives the family station wagon into an Air Force missile range in the Nevada desert. The situation gets particularly grim when the family realizes their plight: out of fuel, broken down, they are surrounded by a family of ruthless cannibals who live in the hills surrounding the test range, and have an affinity for baby-with-lamb-sauce. Unable to run, the family circles the wagons and faces a brutal siege from unseen attackers, and must draw on their inner beasts in order to survive.
When the credits rolled, I was non-plussed. The film is reputedly a classic, and supposedly influential, but---well, I figured, it must have been my mood. So I rented ""The Hills Have Eyes"", and gave the movie another shot.
Same reaction: I just don't see why all the raves about a film that simply isn't scary, and tries so hard to be shocking that it's laughable. The cannibals of the movie (with names like Jupiter, Pluto, Mars, and Mercury---get it?) go lumbering around in broad daylight wearing animal skins, and look for all the world like something out of ""The Land Time Forgot"". While the initial encounter between the fresh young college lad and a skulking cannibal is spooky (because it occurs at night), most of the action happens during the day, minimizing the suspense.
And sure, Michael Berryman as Pluto is a freaky looking dude, but even the shock of his appearance wears off after a few minutes. And after that few minutes, what you're left with is a derivative, boring, poorly paced, atrociously ugly, and completely suspenseless rip-off of far superior films like Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"".
The truly amazing thing about this and Craven's other early shock-film ""Last House on the Left"" is that anyone in Hollywood was willing to advance Craven *any* money for *anything* else after these two clunkers. But Craven, thankfully, improved, and we have ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" as the happy result---and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" as a kind of sick curiosity left behind on his road to cinematic success.",1063584000,9,3298,4.847517730496454
1212207,3,B00000FZ5B,"Have you ever heard of this film before?  ... The basic plot, such as it is,  appears something like this: A civilized family is traveling to California when their station wagon suddenly breaks down.  Being city folk, the group soon realizes that they are unprepared for survival in the desert.  The group contends with the heat, the dust, and the barren appearance of the god forsaken environment. They soon realize that these are small matters when compared to the group of inbred hillbilly cannibals watching them from the cliffs, waiting for a ripe moment to rape, pillage, and eventually consume the city slickers.  Now the driving question: what is the point of this motion picture?  Are you looking for philosophy? Director and Screenwriter Wes Craven certainly devotes ample time to the dissection of what it means to be civilized, and why this can be both a curse and a blessing for mankind.  The curse lies within the idea that a group of people can become so attached to modern society that they lose all form of communication with the natural world.  This character flaw almost costs the life of each family member.  Civilized existence can also be a blessing.  After all, the group uses technology like automobiles and handguns to defeat the malicious cannibals and, upon consideration of these hill people, one is thankful that their way of life does not persist.  As mankind evolves, our tolerance for the giving and taking of pain and suffering weakens, and along with this goes our belief in the Darwinian notion of survival of the fittest.  It may be a chaotic universe and nothing may really matter in the end, but I think most of mankind would agree that the infliction of pain on another for no practical reason is not only senseless, but disgusting.  Though actual philisophical dialogue is nonexistent, the feeling and emotion of this philosophy is imbued within the entire structure of the film.  What about the rest of it?  Does the film have any other redeemable qualities?  Like the philisophical approach, it all depends on what sort of viewer one chooses to be.  The film itself is highly original, unbelievably frightening, and very disturbing, which explains why it has become a cult hit amongst the horror movie crowd.  If one were writing a college thesis on cannibalism, this film might serve as a welcome companion to, say, the 1999 film ""Ravenous"".  Actor Michael Berryman makes an appearance as the cannibal named Pluto, along with his trademark bug eyes and bald head. Berryman also returns as the main villain in the film's sequel, ""The Hills Have Eyes II"".  Michael Berryman has literally made an entire career out of playing eccentric characters in small bit roles, always utilizing but not wholly depending on his very unusual physical appearance.  Combine this with the fact that Berryman really is a talented actor and this has all the making of a memorable screen appearance.  The bottom line is that Horror fans and cannibal scholars will probably love the film, philosophers may enjoy the existential mood and feel of it, and people simply looking for a scare may discover more than they are willing to bargain for.  From a personal standpoint, I am generally not a horror movie buff and do not plan on writing a thesis on cannibalism in the near future.  I can get philosophy anywhere and, other than Michael Berryman, the film held little for me to jump and cheer about.  Objectively, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a small but solid motion picture and will definitely appeal to its proper audience.  So watch what you eat!  One may never know who lurks in the outskirts of civilization, or how hungry they may become!  You have been warned.

1212208,4,B00000FZ5B,The hills have eyes is without one of Wes Craven's best films.  It is only toped by Last House On the Left.  Like Last House this was a shocker for its time.  Suspensful and terrifing story about a family stranded in the deseret who are attacked by a family of cannibals.  The gore is quite good and the story is also quite disturbing.  A great film.,985824000,4,350,4.242424242424242
1212266,5,B00000FZ5B,"Horror fans are well versed in all things Wes Craven. Craven has presented a number of movies in the horror genre and was the creative mind behind Freddy Krueger and the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series of films. But before that he had already cemented his name in the halls of horror. Before SCREAM, before THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS, before DEADLY BLESSINGS and before SHOCKER, Craven had given us two movies that are still talked about to this day. The first was THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. The second was this film, THE HILLS HAVE EYES.

The story is an original one. It begins with a family traveling out west bound for California but stopping by an old silver mine they were given as a gift for parents of the group for their silver anniversary. The group consists of Bob and Ethel Carter (Russ Grieve and Virginia Vincent), their daughter Lynne, her husband Doug and their infant child (Dee Wallace and Martin Speer) and their youngest children Bobby and Brenda (Robert Houston and Suze Lanier-Bramlett).

As they reach the desert they stop for gas at an about to be abandoned station. The owner Frank (John Steadman) tells them the mines dried up years ago and that now the Air Force uses that area for target practice, advising them to turn around and get back on the highway. Of course they ignore his suggestion, go forward and eventually run off the road resulting in a broken axle. Bob heads back to the station and Doug goes to see if he can find the air base.

What Bob finds when he gets to the station is Frank in a panic. He tells him he tried to warn him and then gives him his story, how he was once married with two children, one beautiful and the other evil as sin. When the evil one kills his wife and other child, Frank hit him with a tire iron and though he had killed him. But the child survived in the desolate hills of this dessert becoming wild and kidnapping a prostitute for his bride and raising a group of savages along the way. Before he can offer a way out one of them grabs him, killing him and leaving Bob behind who then sets off to his family.

As the film progresses we see this mutant family attack the nuclear family with the intent of not only taking what they have but with the hope of using them for food as well. Only one is having second thoughts, Ruby (Janus Blythe) who looks for a way out of this life and into civilization. By the end of the film the question of just which family is more savage is brought to mind and the victor is determined. But which family will that be?

As with all early films this one had a limited budget but Craven put that to good use. Most of the actors involved were unknowns, including Dee Wallace whod had just a few roles prior to this film and went on to star in movies like THE HOWLING, E.T. and CUJO. That these actors were not famous seems to have worked to the benefit of the film since had they been we would have been more involved with that aspect rather than investing in characters that are in jeopardy.

The concept of the mutant family living in the dessert surrounded by rocks and caves to hide in was interesting and based on a true story at least partially. They have a hierarchy with the father in charge and ruling over all, keeping them in line via fear. The stand out among them is Pluto (Michael Berryman), an actor born with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a rare condition leaving him with no sweat glands, hair, fingernails or teeth. This gives him a different appearance than most people which he used to his advantage taking on roles in numerous horror films. (An aside note, having met him I can tell you that Berryman is a gentle giant of a man who is perhaps one of the nicest and friendliest people you will ever meet. Like actor Bill Mosely he is nothing like the characters he plays in films.).

The film moves at a steady pace offering us enough back story and set ups to hold our interest from the beginning on. When the confrontations begin we are by then invested in the family and the struggle to survive they go through while being attacked. As viewers we are often asked to put ourselves in the shoes of those characters we watch. Trying to do so hear leaves you in a state of fear many movies cant begin to form.

The film has been released numerous times on both video and then disc so why bother with this new edition? Two words should make that easy to understand: Arrow Video. Arrow once more proves why they are the premiere company when it comes to releasing classic and ignored horror films. Here is why.

To begin with you get a brand new 4K restoration from original film elements, supervised by producer Peter Locke. Then you move on to the extras. As always Arrow goes overboard here. Included are 6 postcards, a reversible fold-out poster featuring new and original artwork, a limited edition booklet featuring writing on the film by critic Brad Stevens along with a consideration on the Hill franchise by Ewan Cant illustrated with original archive stills, audio commentary by the late Craven and Peter Locke, LOOKING BACK ON THE HILLS HAVE EYE a making of documentary with interviews including Craven, Locke, Berryman, Wallace, Blythe, Houston, Lanier and director of photography Eric Saarinen, THE DESERT SESSIONS a brand new interview with composer Don Peake, an alternate ending in HD for the first time, trailers and TV spots, an image gallery, the original screenplay and a reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Paul Shipper.

If you're a fan of the film or of Wes Craven then by all means you need to add this version of the film to your collection. It is by far the best presentation of it weve been offered so far. If youve never seen the film you have missed out and should do so immediately.

1212271,3,B00000FZ5B,"I had never seen this movie. Saw the remake and LOVED it. Love Dee Wallace so figured I would buy the expensive Arrow release. It's a nice package flawed only by its baggy bluray case art sleeve (what's up with that cheap crap). However the movie itself wasn't really for me. The remake had much better pacing, better everything so that's pretty rare that a remake outdoes the original.

Wes Craven disappoints me again. In fact, Wes always disappoints me. How people mention him with the likes of John Carpenter is beyond me. Two different ends of the spectrum of directing talent. Look what Carpenter made from 80-88 alone! And Wes has Freddy Kruger and Scream. Yeah.. ok. Serpent and the Rainbow is as close to a decent movie as Wes ever got. People Under the Stairs??? Seriously??? Lol

Update: I'm sure Wes was a great human being and may he RIP, but you can tell I'm sick of being burnt by blind buying his highly rated ""masterpieces"". He's no John Carpenter and I constantly see that comparison made. Carpenter made a few stinkers too, but his were still somewhat salvageable. When Wes was at his best, he didn't even equal Carpenters failures.

Carpenters 80-88 output:
'80 The Fog
'81 Escape from NY
'82 The Thing
'83 Christine
'84 Starman
'86 Big trouble in little China
'87 Prince of Darkness
'88 They Live

Compare that to singing ""one, two, Freddie's coming for you"". No seriously Wes personal nightmare was one two John Carpenters coming for you! In Wes defense, Carpenter is a film God.",1494460800,3,1501,4.674242424242424

1212325,5,B00000FZ5B,"The Hills Have Eyes was Wes Craven's second directorial film after The Last House on the Left (I'm not counting his stint as Abe Snake directing The Fireworks Woman). Much like The Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes has a gritty, low-budget, violent look, having been shot on 16mm film. Given the budget of approximately $230,000, Wes Craven was able to craft a violent, sometimes humorous horror film that to this day is still quite popular among the horror crowd. The film has gone on to spawn a few sequels and a couple actual good remakes, however, we are not here to talk about those. Instead, we are going to focus on the first film only, as Arrow Video has gone above and beyond in releasing an absolutely stunning Blu-ray release. Read on to see why...

MOVIE REVIEW

I remember the first time sitting down with The Hills Have Eyes and not really appreciating the film. I laughed at some of the sketchy acting and the often times hilarious low-budget look of the film. I was a naive, stupid boy back then and nowadays I can appreciate a film better. Instead of laughing at the acting, I accept it as a product of its time. The low-budget look of the film no longer seems terrible, but impressive given the actual budget. This time around, I fell in love with the film, much in thanks to Arrow Video's amazing work on fixing up the transfer, which I will get to in a bit.

The story behind The Hills Have Eyes is a fairly simple one. A family on a trip to California, take a detour through the desert to visit an old silver mine. Unbeknownst to them, the area they are travelling through was a nuclear testing ground, that has spawned a family of savages in the hills. After getting run off the road by a feisty rabbit, the family gets stuck in the desert, right across from the hill people's home.

After the group split up (of course!), the hill people advance and start the rampage in their quest for a juicy meal (a nice baby for example). Thankfully, the family has some kickass dogs to help protect them. Also, Martin Speers deadly moustache.

The Hills Have Eyes takes a bit to get going, but once it starts it doesn't stop. There are plenty of moments of heart-pumping terror, especially for anyone who has a child. There are a few areas that may put you off. One character's incessant screaming will drive you to the point of yelling at the screen to shut up. Also, the ending is somewhat abrupt, but in a way, suits the film. On the other hand, the alternate ending, included on the Blu-ray, rearranges the scenes at end and tacks on a happy ending that doesn't fit the tone of the movie.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Arrow Video doesn't just knock the ball out of the park, they have knocked it out of the city. The Blu-ray comes in a nice sturdy cardboard box, providing a fantastic booklet, a reversible poster (original poster on one side, new on the other) and inside the Blu-ray you have some cool lobby cards.

As for the transfer, originally shot on 16mm, the grain is heavy at times, but Arrow cranked out a transfer that beats the crap out of all other transfers. No more nasty compression issues, instead you have an even grainfield, with just a few issues of distortion and dirt and debris. Some may not like the look of the film, but if you head here: caps-a-holic, you can see just how damn nice this new Blu-ray looks. The same goes for the solid Mono soundtrack.

The special features aren't skimped on either, as you get a nice 54 minute documentary from Anchor Bay, some new lengthy interviews, the alternate ending, commentaries, outtakes, trailers and a gallery. This disc is bursting at the seams.

VERDICT

The Hills Have Eyes has actually aged quite nicely. Yes, there are some low budget issues here and there, but the tension and terror still live on. We will always miss Wes Craven, but Arrow Video keeps his legacy alive with this absolutely phenomenal Blu-ray.",1480896000,,3903,4.521985815602837

First off, this has always been my favorite movie. I own multiple VHS versions, an original promo betamax tape, DVD, LaserDisc, and now this new Blu-ray. The restoration was well done and still holds much of the grittiness it previously had. It is nice to see the improvements made that make it much more clear than older runs.

I do not like the new album art but Arrow Video was smart in allowing the actual cover art on the BR case to be reversible so you can have either the new or original artwork. Same with the included poster. The ~36 page book was a nice addition and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. And the little postcards were a nice addition as well. If you aren't a true strong fan of this movie, just buy the DVD, but for those of us who think this is a true classic, this set is a must have.",1476230400,12,953,4.318435754189944
1212359,3,B00000FZ5B,"Low-budget horror hit a peak in the 70s with films like Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wes Cravens The Last House on the Left, breaking the barriers of good taste and the heretofore-predictable rules of scary movies audiences came to expect.  These were the pioneers of the anti-Hollywood horror movie.  While Hooper peaked with brief mainstream success as a director-for-hire on Spielberg's Poltergeist, Craven took the long road eventually getting his due with the Elm Street and Scream franchises.  But he could never recapture the exploitation zeitgeist of his early work, especially The Hills Have Eyes, which tapped into an ugly mirror image of the American family that the director carried with him the rest of his career.

The Carter family takes an ill-advised shortcut through an atomic test zone and winds up stranded in the middle of the desert.  Their presence attracts the attention of a different sort of family altogether, inbred mutants who survive on human flesh and are planning to invite all the Carter's to dinner...even the 6-month old baby!  Now both sides are in a desperate fight for survival with the Carter's getting a surprise assist from their German Shepherd who, as it turns out, has a taste for flesh of its own.

Hills is a jury-rigged minor masterpiece, held together by sheer brute force and an overwhelming sense of dread; this is despite Craven's tendency to lay down the psychological subtext a bit thick, a flaw he carried with him most of his career.  The set-piece scene that earned the film its reputation is a disturbingly violent attack at the family RV that includes one rape, two deaths and the aforementioned baby saved for dinner.  Almost 30 years later, it still has the power to shock.  But it's a step up from the truly tasteless sexual violence of Last House and proved, even at this crude level, Craven was learning how to play to a mass audience.

And the fact the Hills is the work of a director in progress is hard to ignore.  The staging is clumsy, even during the jump scares, and the mutant make-up / costumes are TV-movie level stuff at best (the film owes actor Michael Berryman's authentic odd features at great deal of gratitude).  But Hills success and longevity is a testament to the Wes Craven's refusal to play it safe, stretching the definition of horror to match the era in which the film was made.

Hills has popped up on home video several times, but it's never come close to looking this good!  The new 4K restoration from Arrow Video adds a tremendous amount of detail and color but still looks like an exploitation film from the '70s.  Most of the extras from previous versions are ported over (Craven and producer Peter Locke's audio commentary, the hour long documentary Looking Back on the Hills Have Eyes, trailers, still and the original screenplay on BD/DVD-ROM) but there are also some terrific new special features including two new audio commentaries (one featuring cast members and another more scholarly track with film historian Mikel Koven) and a sit-down interview with composer Don Peake.

The film is playable in its original form (with its original mono soundtrack restored) or with it's more ""audience-friendly"" alternate ending, now presented in HD for the first time.  Perks listed but not supplied for review include 6 postcards, a reversible foldout poster and a limited edition booklet featuring new writing on the film by critic Brad Stevens.",1473984000,,3450,4.9189655172413795

As it turns out we were, and we soon forgot about my bombshell movie suggestion. Needless to say, this was one of the most (if not THE) worst movies I had ever seen in my life. One that if Hollywood had any brains on what should be allowed to be released and what shouldn't be, based on how bad it is, would have never been allowed to be seen by public eyes paying for entertainment.

What really makes this movie more overkill is it jumps into some serious risky territory with its scenes of a GUN being pointed at a BABY, and some really sick molest and rape scenes.

If that weren't enough, there's really no story or anything. Frankly, as I was watching it I at first thought I was watching some banned movie. Only a mind of a psycho killer could come up with this pointless torture porn.

In fact, I couldn't even finish it. After the scene where the gun is pointed at the baby, I was like NOPE, and shut it off.

Those mutants will eat anything, dogs, babies, other people, etc. Maybe when the movie came out it was ""slightly"" scary, but the plot and the acting are just down right horrible.

blu-ray reissue of THE HILLS HAVE EYES
which does look very Good 1:85:1 HD Transfer & Image gave the film a big sound mix in 6.1 master mix
which sounds excellent in my opinion
Image also carried over all the extras from the 2 disc Anchor bay dvd
but now U.K. Arrowfilms has just reissued the film on blu-ray aswell the U.K. blu-ray was released on Oct 3rd
the U.S. release is Oct 11 next week
Arrow have said they've fully restored the film with new 4k 1:85:1 HD scan so i bought myself a copy to check out the quality
i must admit the picture quality does look amazing, Hardly no Grain or dirt very sharp & clear picture for sure
much sharper quality than the Image ent' transfer Arrowfilms made lots of effort with the picture for sure- 8-9/10
tragically they did not do the same with the sound quality, the film would sound really Good with new 5.1 mix
but tragically Arrow only gave the film 1.0 mono sound mix which sounds terrible- 4-5/10
the films sound deserves better sound mix for sure not a bulls*** 1.0 mono sound what a stupid idea
EXTRAS well Arrow carried over all the extras from the old 2 disc Anchor bay dvd, i mean all of them
the retrospective Doco LOOKING BACK AT HILLS HAVE EYES is still the same Digital remaster quality has not been upgraded at all
pretty poor effort i think, Arrow could've given the Doco a new HD transfer
but arrow also added 2 new interviews to which are worth watching
along with the usual Theatrical trailer, TV spots, stills Photo Gallery, Wes craven's old dvd commentary- 10/10 for the extras
so is this new U.K. blu-ray worth buying, for the new 4k picture quality it is
but as i said the sound quality is only 1.0 mono sound mix which could easily be boosted to new 5.1
and again all the old dvd extras have been carried over
packaging is hard cover box with clamshell blu-ray case with 1 Blu-ray Disc + original Movie poster
full 3 stars for new U.K. blu-ray based on new 4k picture quality but terrible sound mix
if the sound was a new 5.1 master mix i would give about 5 stars for it but tragically Arrow didn't bother with the sound",1394236800,3,2158,4.330864197530865

This is my favorite Wes Craven film! The remake pales against this one in my opinion. This is the classic film scenario of the haves, & the have not's. The city slickers, & the backwards, dirt poor country inbreeds, gone totally berserk. Though one would be right in saying this film discriminates hugely against people who live deep in the wilds. This is more of a film on city people's stereotypes of the rural dirt poor. How the civilized urban family can be turned into a viscous killing machine, given the right circumstance, every bit as brutal & ruthless as their backwards adversaries. No one is immune to violence.

Ample amounts of dread, suspense, & most of all pathos, fill this film like a over boiling pot of water left on the stove. There are really tough scenes to watch here, as they dig their way into your brain like barbed fish hooks. The barbs are deeply imbedded into your psyche, not to be forgotten, not to be removed. The scene with the dead mother used as bait to kill the cannibals, is in my opinion, one of the most heart rendering, brutal scenes in horror. The pathos of this scene can not be measured. Yet there are scenes that put us in the city family's mind set, as we root for the families German Sheppard, out hunting & killing the cannibals, & maybe most of all, the final scene of redemption, as the passive liberal non-violent father, exacts his revenge at the end of this film. Yes, Craven knows how to manipulate us with the horrendous, turned into the heroic!

Craven is not a director that I care for a lot of his movies. His sensationalism preying on our inbred fears, can be very heavy handed, but when he gets it right, & he gets it right here, he is nothing less than visionary!",1367107200,2,1747,4.470219435736677

1212616,4,B00000FZ5B,"Shocking. Terrifying. Extreme. An idyllic road trip to California ends in disaster when the Carter family becomes stranded on an old desert road. The worst is yet to come when they discover that THE HILLS HAVE EYES! Wes Craven returns to the screen with his sophomore horror entry following the exploitation classic THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is an extension of the themes found in LAST HOUSE. When left to fend for themselves, the Carter family quickly surrenders their civility for the same blood lust and savagery as their cannibal counterparts, leaving the audience to question if there is really any difference between the two. Craven demonstrates a dramatic advancement in form in his second feature, refining his characters while also dropping the uneven tone that plagued LAST HOUSE. As far as filming goes, there is nothing polished about THE HILLS HAVE EYES. It is as gritty, visceral, and raw, using the lay of the land and minimal production to convey a darkened sense of reality. This style, often referred to as 'guerilla filmmaking,' set THE HILLS HAVE EYES apart from nearly all other big studio productions of the time. Michael Berryman is iconic as the cannibal family's deformed son Pluto, who has since become one of Horror's most memorable villains. Perhaps even more frightening is Lance Gordon's portrayal of Pluto's feral brother Mars, who drinks the blood of the family's pet bird before threatening to eat their baby. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is yet another highly-influential and genre-changing effort by director Wes Craven, who would go on to redefine the Slasher genre a few years later with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

1212660,4,B00000FZ5B,"Horror specialist Wes Craven's second feature film, The Hills Have Eyes (1977), was violent, raw, and shocking for the times, as a family travelling on vacation, encounter their worst nightmare, when they fall victim to an organized band of blood-thirsty, flesh eating hill folk.  A film that was originally awarded an X-rating, is still a movie with some edge and impact, even given the graphic violence common in horror today.

Travelling in a station wagon with a house trailer in tow, the Carter family is bound for California.  After stopping for gas, ex-cop Bob Carter (Russ Grieve) crashes the wagon, and breaks an axle, leaving the family stranded in the desert, under the watchful eyes of a group of murderous flesh eaters.  Bob and his son-in-law Doug (Martin Speer), head off on foot in opposite directions to try and find help.  Left behind are Bob's wife Ethel (Virginia Vincent), and his three children Bobby (Robert Houston), Brenda (Susan Lanier), and married daughter Lynne (Dee Wallace) and her baby daughter Catherine.

Arriving back at the gas station, the owner Fred (John Steadman), informs Bob that his freakish son Jupiter (James Whitworth) is living in the hills, and that his family is in danger.  On the way back to his family, Bob is captured by Jupiter.  After Doug returns to the trailer, the night air is filled with Bob's screams.  As some of the family run to see what is happening, Jupiter's sons Pluto (Michael Berryman), and Mars (Lance Gordon) enter the trailer and commit homicidal mayhem, grabbing the baby girl, whom they intend to eat.

Thanks to Beast, one of the family's pet dogs, the survivors acquire a walkie talkie radio, and are able to listen in as Jupiter's clan plan to return and finish them off.  The dog proves to be a fearless fighter, and with their lives on the line, the desperate survivors also rise to the challenge.  Working as a team, Bobby and Brenda battle Jupiter, while Jupiter's daughter Ruby (Janus Blythe), saves the life of the baby, and Doug as well.

Shot exclusively on location, the film has some rough edges, but feels quite authentic.  At an early stage, the man who would later make A Nightmare on Elm Street, Swamp Thing, and Scream, displays a sense of style in the genre.  The subject matter was daring and bold for the times.  The gore, like Pluto's chewed up foot, and Big Tom's burned head, are used tastefully and to good effect.  Having some knowledge about both the Carter family, and the hill people, makes for a more understandable story.  The hill folk may be twisted savages, but they are intelligent, which makes them even more scary and dangerous.  Michael Berryman's unique appearance makes for an iconic villain.

Anchor Bay's 2003 two disc special edition contains solid extras.  Wes Craven and producer Peter Locke provide a frank and informative commentary track.  The nearly hour long retrospective, Looking Back At The Hills Have Eyes is particularly lively, with lots of interview clips with the surviving cast.  The Directors: The Films of Wes Craven, is a retrospective covering the early part of Craven's career.  Also included is an alternate ending that ties things up more neatly, than the abrupt ending in the film.  The film not having subtitles is about all the only major omission.

Wes Craven continued the ""Hills"" story in the sequel, The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 (1985).  Closely following Craven's original, Andre Aja's remade the film in 2006.

1212713,4,B00000FZ5B,"In Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" a family finds themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere and at the mercy of a blood-thirsty clan of mutant cannibals. Ultra-violence, booby-traps and other shenanigans ensue.

In spite of its clumsy opening, the film gets going rather quickly, leaving not a single moment to spare. When things get bad for our unfortunate family, they get really bad, taking a grisly and gruesome turn for the worse. The overall tone is that all bets are off, and it's never clear just who will survive and who will meet an unfortunate and unpleasant demise. The acting (especially from the villains) is spotty at best (with a completely wasted Dee Wallace in tow) but the film doesn't succumb to that fact. As Wes Craven's second film (following up ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-House-on-the-Left/dp/B000068IEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last House on the Left</a>""), it shows signs of the true genius that would give birth to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street/dp/B00000JQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>"" with some interesting plot devices (a dog becoming a main character in the final act? Rock on!) striking visuals, an eerie setting (it's all about location, location, location) and an unrelenting mean streak.

While time hasn't been too kind to the film - being that it looks horribly dated now that a 2006&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/remake/dp/B000FAOC2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">remake</a>, directed by Alexandre Aja, turned out to be quite the success -- it's still a well-paced, gritty and grim affair that keeps you on your toes throughout its brief 86 minute running time. In a way, it's a film that was ahead of the curve and deserves to be seen by any and all genre fans as the iconic piece of horror movie history that it is.",1300492800,,1960,5.873684210526315

The music alone was enough to make one's skin crawl and the eerie cinematography of the shadowy desert surroundings would give even the strongest person nightmares that would last a week.  Towards about three-fourths of the movie, however, things take a turn for the worse and the entire show gets down-right disturbing--even depressing.  I guess due to the fact that there is just so much of this type of senseless violence being perpetrated in today's world, I found this part of the film quite tasteless and I just had to watch something a lot more light-hearted after this.  But if Craven was trying to shock and disturb, then I can say his tactics sure worked.  This film reminded me a lot of another movie of 70's nastalgia and that was ""Deliverance"", about an ill-fated canoe trip taken by a group of inexperienced men through an eerie wilderness and being attacked by savage mountain people.  The plot in ""The Hills Have Eyes"", is quite similar, except this time it is with a suburban family in the desert, navigating their way through an empty land in which they only THINK they understand.  Bottom line is, I felt the atmoshpere was excellent, but the depressing violence, death, and gore towards the end made it into a film that I would really not care to see again.

One of the most influential and most original horror movies to come out of the late 70's! Wes Craven who wrote and direct this movie has made a cult favorite that stands the test of time with it's disturbing elements and gore, it also manages to be better then his previous ""Last House on The Left"" but succeeded better then that movie. Dee Wallace Stone (whom you remember as Eliot's mom from ""ET"") and Michael Barryman who plays the odd-headed cannibal Pluto shine here in such memorable performances, the film got an ""X"" rating originally due to the graphic violence but got an ""R"" rating and the movie was a drive-in success. This movie will be better known as the king of all killer hillbilly movies and is a total cult horror classic.

This 2-Disc DVD set has great picture and sound quality as the movie is shown it's uncut version for the first time on DVD! the extras are cool as well with a featurette that takes a look behind Wes Craven with his successes, audio commentary by Wes Craven, behind the scenes photo gallery, bio of Wes Craven, A documentary on the film, storyboard art, alternate ending, trailers & TV Spots, and poster-and-advertising art.

Young kids have no clue what a good horror movie is all about and that's why remakes actually make money(actually most of them lose money) I've said this before and I'll say it again, anyone that knows anything about horror movies realizes there is much more to it than pretty people on screen, loud bangs and CG effects.

Craven's story about a family on there way to California stop off in the middle of the desert looking for silver. When their Vehicle breaks down they are in for the fight of their lives. A cannibal family living in the hills see a means to survive and plan on feasting on the ""fresh meat"".

So the lighting isn't great, so the effects aren't as good SO WHAT!!!!!!!!! I'd love to see 'any' director take Craven's budget for this film or Tobe Hooper's budget from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and make half of a movie today. Directors today can't even think of an original story.

Real fans of the genre will appreciate the originals, the classics such as ""Halloween"", ""Black Christmas"", ""The Fog"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Evil Dead"" etc. People who still need to learn about the genre will prefer the remake fakes.

1212733,5,B00000FZ5B,"I don't know how some folks can say the remake is better, scarier, more effective than the original.  Even with a much larger budget than the first one, this movie is not one bit scary.  The original wins hands-down.  No comparison whatsoever !  The low-budget, gritty feel of the 70's one works a lot better than the CGI effects in the recent one.  I saw the remake the night it opened back in March and then bought it last week to give it the benefit of the doubt and all I could do is shake my head and think to myself this movie is awful.  The acting by the white-bread family is piss-poor, the cannibals are beyond ridiculous-looking, the gory effects not at all scary.  In fact, too much gore in a horror movie, to me, makes the movie less scary.  Another weak point in the remake is the lack of character development amongst the cannibals.  I mean you knew how they became mutants....they show it in the opening credits and when Big Bob goes back to the gas station for help, he reads all the newspaper clippings.  In the first movie, Grandpa Fred gives a backstory on Papa Jupe and his wild kids to Big Bob.  He doesn't explain how Papa Jupe became messed up but we are subtly told that when Brenda sees on the map that they're near a nuclear testing site.  Craven created a more intelligent and thought-provoking story than Alexandre Aja. At least the audience had to think for themselves on why the family became messed up in the first movie.  Plus the acting by cannibals in the remake doesn't compare to the '70's family.  I saw someone wrote that Lizard in the remake was much better than Mars in the original.  What ?!?!  Lizard was this skinny little freak who really resembled Keith Richards !!!  Lizard even acted corny in the movie, in my opinion.  When he invades the trailer, he puts on an apron and a sunhat like a real cornball !!  Could you imagine Mars doing that in the first one??  I think not.  And when Lizard tries to fondle Brenda, she starts throwing the pillow at him and all he does is slap his hands against the pillow like a little girl.  I still think Mars was more vicious and the actor, Lance Gordon, played a much cooler cannibal.  The way he acted out his famous lines (""Baby's fat, you fat"") and his reaction to when Lynn stabs him was so much more real.  Lizard acted like a goof ball when Lynn stabbed him.  And Pluto ?!?!  Please !!  His look was way over the top in the remake.  At least they didn't have to put any make-up on Michael Berryman.  And Jupiter barely had a role in the remake and his commands to the other mutants were stolen by Big Brain in the remake (Kill the baby !)

The original is so much better in terms of 1) acting, 2) the cannibals (look, dialogue), 3) suspense, 4) directing, 5) location was scarier, and 6) story.

Actually I'm glad they made a remake because it makes the original so much better !",1151193600,19,2870,4.348399246704331

1212782,4,B00000FZ5B,"Before Wes Craven created the masterpiece known as A Nightmare On Elm Street, he made a few other talked about horror films including the Last House on the Left and the Hills Have Eyes. Many critics described Last House as brutal, realistic and tragic in many forms. Last House built up a reputation for Wes, but it would be in his later projects that would truly give him the title master of terror. In 1977 Wes Craven released 'The Hills Have Eyes'. A film with a puzzling story and realistic approach to civilization in which I will get to later in this review. Shot in a budget between $275,000 to $325,000, Craven terrified an audience without showing a lot of blood and die hard gore. Instead he used suspense to scare viewers and it worked out very well. The Hills Have Eyes was one of the most suspenseful films that year of its release, featuring a family who are being tormented by a mutated/cannibalistic family who live in the desert hills. The Hills Have Eyes is a true landmark in the horror genre.

In the Hills Have Eyes we fallow a family who are on a road trip to California. Along the way their cars pulls off the road and breaks down in the middle of the desert. Soon after that they are being haunted and slowly killed off by the Planet family. A group of mutated individuals who live uncivilized in the hills of the desert. While the family is being tormented by these cannibals they come up with ways to fight back and defend themselves in hope of surviving and saving the ones they love most. When I look back at it the plot and overall idea was pretty original for its time. We've seen other films similar to it but it doesn't have the same approach or message in the end. The Hills Have Eyes is a different kind of horror film. Using suspense to shock an audience and it does a great job of that. When the film was first rated it received an X rating. It wasn't as much of the blood and gore but the suspense that caused it to receive an X. It's the suspense and music which make it seem realistic, horrifying and tragic in some parts. It's not as strong or as edgy as Last House on the Left, but it's damn near close.

The film has a fair amount of blood but very little gore. This is mostly due to the films low budget. In this movie we are introduced to a great cast of actors. It's surprising to hear what these actors had to go through, filming out in the desert running around in the rocks and having to withstand all the cold nights. I thought the acting was great, it made the look and feel of the movie realistic and it really caught my attention seeing all these different characters trying to handle all of these violent situations. As the film progresses you'll notice a change in some of the characteristics of the people in the film. Half of the characters in this movie are normal and the other half are well, different. I thought they did a pretty good job casting actors who were odd looking but very warm spirited groups of people. This helped out especially with the films low budget. Normally you would take an actor and sit them down on a makeup chair to give them a less than normal look, but they just couldn't do that with this movie. So instead we are treated with natural and great on screen performances by Lance Gordon, Michael Berryman, Janus Blythe, Cordy Clark, Brenda Marinoff and a cameo by producer Peter Locke.

If the film had a bigger budget you can just imagine how much more they could have done with the look of the characters. What impressed me the most about this was its overall message about civilization. You ever notice not just in films but also in real life that people will go out of their way to do whatever they can to protect a loved one? I think that aspect is greatly shown in this film. Not only does the family in this picture fight back but you start to see a turn, or switch between the character roles. Eventually the hunters become the hunted and with the ending it showed you that the most civilized can be the most savage. Although I did like the message in the ending I thought the film could have went on a little longer. The movie just seemed to end very fast and when it did end I was puzzled saying to myself ""is that it?"". I thought the ending could have been longer or at least included some more scenes to show what happens later with the characters who survived.

Overall I thought the Hills Have Eyes was a good movie. It's a horror classic which relies on it's suspense to terrify an audience. For me the films setbacks were with the budget. It would have been nice to see more blood and gore, and even a better look with some of the characters. I also thought that there could have been much more to the ending. Those were my only real big problems with the film. Other than that I loved the story and cast of characters. The acting is good and the suspense is well done, especially with the films music. This is a horror film that I will always remember and enjoy watching. It's an old film but it's not all that outdated. I was most impressed with the story and message about civilization. For me the good definitely out weighs the bad and I had a good time watching the Hills Have Eyes.",1146268800,5,5189,4.3353909465020575
1212783,4,B00000FZ5B,"After watching this 88 minute I must say that I was a bit dissapointed about the ending, I thought that Mr. Craven could have thought out everything a little better and put together a hell of an ending (at least a better than this one...), the reason that I think that he did not do so was because he was on a tight budget ... but I mean come on the ending is the part of the film that sticks with you and is by far the most important.

As a whole though the simple idea of being stranded in what was then an extremely desolate land was really quite scary. I thought that Wes Cravens idea of the derranged cannibals in New Mexico was brilliant, just because back in the 70's New Mexico was barely apart of the U.S.A (much less thriving with people) and even though it was, I think very few people actually knew what was going on there. The movie displayed New Mexico very well and definatly capitalized on the ""Your all alone so you got to save yourself factor"" I thought that the people that played the man-eating hillbillys did a very good job as well as the people that were stranded, but as I said I thought they really could have made the ending better ... but hey every movie has a flaw. Smart Screenplay, decent film. A must own for horror fans.

Grade: B

P.S ... I thought that the new ""Hills Have Eyes' directed by french extrodinar Alexandre Aja did this film just and was over a pretty scary/good little gore fest.

1212787,4,B00000FZ5B,"First time I watched ""The Hills Have Eyes"" about 10 years ago and liked it. Now I watched it for the second time and somehow liked it even more, although I was surprised - this low-budget film is about thirty years old! But it looks very intense and brutal even now. Reminds a lot of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", more to it - both movies were made practically at the same time. Interesting fact: art-director Robert Burns who worked on the set of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" three years earlier worked for ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". And all the bones and skulls you can see in the cave of the degenerate cannibals, came straight from the house of grim Sawyer family.
But if ""Massacre"" concentrated mainly on horror of innocent youths being maimed and murdered, Wes Craven went a little farther - he showed how a will to survive and protect yourself from violence can turn you into a violent beast. The last frame of the film, when we see furious and savage face of a man who in a day turned from an ordinary person into a raging killer, just shocks you and leaves thoughtful. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a truly disturbing feature which never seems to be out of date. It still looks fresh and actual.
If you're trying to choose between different editions, I have to tell that the american one has a documentary on Craven's career and the british contains one called ""American Nightmare"" - an insight into the horror of american films and life. It has fascinating interviews with Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, George Romero, David Cronenberg and John Landis.

1212788,1,B00000FZ5B,"Alright well now I realize that my one-star review and negative title will no doubt earn me scores of negative reviews from fans of the film, but my voice will still be heard; if you have not seen this movie, please watch something else.  I was attempting to watch lots of horror films (is it Halloween time), and so I decided upon this one.  It had a decent premise and was done by Wes Craven.  What could go wrong?

Well, to answer my own question, a lot.  For one- the characters are never developed.  Character development is hardly a must in an 89 minute horror film, but the script does not bestow any traits on any character.  Critics bemoan when characters are made into stereotypes (e.g. The Jock, the Brain, etc.) but at least that way they're somewhat identifyable.  The only thing different about chracters in this film is their age difference and occaisonally their hair color.  The characters are also universally stupid- they keep wandering out in the darkness without flashlights or leaving their RV unguarded or perhaps wandering off the main road in search of a silver mine in an air force bombing facility.  Between their inherent stupidity and their complete lack of depth, it is impossible to like, let alone ""get in the shoes"" of any of the characters.

Sadly the problems do not stop there.  The film is also marred by a complete lack of any beleiveability.  The desert (which never comes into play the way a setting should, e.g. the moors in American Werewolf) is occasionally hot or cold, but characters easily walk 6-12 miles through out without water without breaking a sweat.  The principal bad guy ""weighed 20 pounds and came out [of the womb] sideways.""  The lack of beleivability ratchets down the tension factor- instead of being scared about being in the middle of nowhere, everyone is completely nonchalant.  Their car's axle is broken and presumbably they will run out of water soon, but no one bats an eyelash.  Further, isn't there something intrinsically scary about a clan of cannibals who hide in caves ala Sawney Bean?  Why go so far over the top with the ridiculous backstory?

*Spoiler Warning* To make matters even worse, only 3 of the ""good"" characters are killed by the mauraders, 2 by gunshot.  While the father's burning is kinda cool, the gunshot deaths are very ho-hum.  This is supposed to be horror; one sees gunshot victims on law and order.  As for the various demises of the badguys, 2 of them die by the family's dog, in the anti-climax of anti-climax.  The baby stolen from the family to be eaten of course isn't, the remaining two bad guys are dispatched in long and tedious fight scenes, and the movie ends.  This is a truly abysmal movie, please see Straw Dogs (for ""my home is my castle"" thrills) or Last House on the Left (for early Wes Craven horror).  0/****",1130630400,7,2822,4.686991869918699
1212859,4,B00000FZ5B,"Wes Craven has had quite a resume of horror films, ranging from the disturbing look at the voodoo culture in THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW to the icon of Freddy Krueger in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is an exercise in survival about as brutal as any other movies about survival.

The movie pits a group of city people out for a vacation with the camper against a group of inbred, desert-dwelling cannibals. One of the most creepy things about the movie is one of its most creepy-looking stars - Michael Berryman. As Pluto, he inhabits the role but is also an incredibly creepy looking guy...I think that's what helps THE HILLS HAVE EYES remain unique. Dee Wallace Stone is good looking in this movie, in both her physical beauty but also her role in the movie...she was quite good. The rest of the actors are also good, especially that old guy boy can he be funny (""There'll be hell to pay now!""). The killings are not incredibly violent by any means, but they are frightening at times, but the best was the attack on Pluto by the german shepherd...he really messed up his foot bigtime. The worst scene in the movie has to be the kidnapping of the baby and the killing of the two mothers. It was so appalling but so intense that you are on edge the whole scene...it was just downright disturbing, but you also find there are hints of humanity even within the cannibals themselves, with Pluto being bested sometimes by his brother would could hurt his feelings. It's an interesting idea that plays out very well. The battle between the town folks and the desert cannibals can get quite intense, and this movie felt similar in some instances to TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE in terms of the family running into a group of cannibals, but mind you, MASSACRE is far better than this still very good film. The ending of the movie left something to be desired, the last shot of the film left me dismayed...they killed off most of the cannibals except the girl who helped to rescue the baby, but we are left with a shot of the surviving father's face and a red background...why end it like that, Wes?

Nonetheless, most of THE HILLS HAVE EYES is quite entertaining and very tense, at times scary as well. It's strength lies within its study of the fine line between human behavior and animal instincts, which the human characters show just as much as the cannibals. Worth a viewing if you're a fan of Wes Craven, THE HILLS HAVE EYES should mostly keep you very entertained, even if the ending leaves a bit to be desired.",1129766400,3,2523,4.530701754385965
1212860,4,B00000FZ5B,"I might have very jaded eyes because this movie did not really scare me one bit... the suspense was utterly lacking and no images were quite sudden enough to invoke a frightened response. But, the movie's lack of scary images does not make it a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination; in fact, I was pleasently surprised at how much I enjoyed this rather simple film.

The plot is about as uncomplicated as it gets: a family from some city is headed toward California, but they get sidetracked looking for some sort of silver mine... now whenever someone gets sidetracked in horror films strange stuff happens. The family station wagon and their trailor crash into a bush while trying to avoid collision with a helpless rabbit... their short-fused dog Beauty gets mutilated and eaten... oh, and a family of super-Hicks (more deformed and violent than the normal kind (who for some reason are all named after planets)) start attacking them.

The family does what any family that doesn't want to die does: fight back. Unfortunately, they only have two guns (one of which gets quickly stolen by the family named after planets). The civilized family's patriarch quickly gets knocked off, along with his wife and their neice... It looks like the city folk have no choice, or do they...

Well, they do... and they begin doing what civilized people do best against savages: innovate... and in a series of Russ Meyer like desert shots (sans the naked ladies), the final battle is waged by the two very different families.

The movie is not really scary, but it certainly is intense... The viewer feels for the characters when they are violently attacked for little to no reason (except maybe dinner) and truly would like to see the persevere. The plot plays out like an action film rather than a horror film, with final confrontations and so on. In truth this movie is probably a revenge flick more than anything else.

Some may say that this movie is about the civilized/uncivilized dichotomy... which it very well may be, but there is no question who Wes Craven is rooting for. The barbaric family of mutants is portrayed in the most evil fashion possible: they try to eat a baby; they mutilate a German Shepherd; they come into a trailer and rape a pretty and wholesome American girl; they are deformed and look pretty close to monsters; the matriarch of the family is an uncaring alcoholic; the patriarch incinerated his little sister and so on. Wes Craven's Italian contemporaries seemed to have far more compassion for barbaric people in the cannibal (Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox, Jungle Holocaust) films than he did.

The movie is heavily cut, but every scene is pretty clear never the less... unlike the old version of films like Streetcar Named Desire that were much harder to understand. Today, in its cut form, the movie could probably fall under the PG-13 rating if a few curse words were taken out, but unfortunately it is unknown whether the original version even exists anymore.

The movie is definately worth a viewing, just don't expect to be too scared, just expect a pretty straight forward action flick and you will most definately not be dissapointed.",1125964800,,3176,4.837937384898711
1212861,5,B00000FZ5B,"After Wes Craven's first film Last House on the Left he became known as gross, perverted, and depraved. This film explores the same gruesome topic that Last House did, the human instinct of vielence. Although this film takes a ""reation vielence"" turn rather than sexual vielence that Last House whent so deeply in. This film shows how 2 differnt families slowly switch sides. The movie begins with a simple kicked back family on a road trip who stumble into the wrong part of the country and are confronted with a canabalistic family who live in the rocky hills and try to get what they need out of the unexpected family, such as: food (the other families baby), supplies (stealing whatever they can), and pleasure (they're daughters body, the joy of killing for no reason). The helpless travelers become stranded and are now victoms to the savage family whatching from the hills. After one of the dogs and several family members are mutilated the ramaining survivors fight back in the same brutal fasion as the killers. The films final conclusion takes place when you realize that the people being killed have become as cold and nasty as the killers. This film whent where few other films have gone but made a powerful statement that isn't to be passed by. Many ot the audiences responded to the film as worthless trash, but beneath the campy advertissments and cult fans this is a very well done film thats not trying to give a good friday night flick to show your girlfriend.

1212862,5,B00000FZ5B,"I found this to be Wes Craven's scariest (and therefore best) film. There is something about cannibals that creeps me out. The part that made me yell out loud was the dog scene. Those kind of scenes are what the horror genre is famous for. Sure, Nightmare and Last House are scary, but this is scarier. This is one of those movies you can't like. You can't really be a fan of this movie. It's too horrifying. It's not like those Jason movies (save parts 1-4, those scared me) that are so corny and stupid that they have a cult following. No, this succeeds as a horror film, not a cult film. It may not impress Scream generation fans, but what do they know anyway. They watch garbage like IKWYDLS, urban Legend, and the worst of the lot, Final Destination. I'm not saying new horror films all suck, 28 Days Later is quite scary.

This movie is raw. It's intense. The setting is spooky. This is a great horror movie. Watch it if you like being scared, but I doubt you will like the actual movie (if that makes any sense at all). Film's in which people die in gruesome ways for no particular reason are impossible to like, but make for great scares, and The Hills Have Eyes is a prime example.",1124496000,,1190,4.336322869955157

1212864,4,B00000FZ5B,"Wes Craven is true master of horror. Shot on a shoestring budget and originally titled ""Blood Relations"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was the follow up to Craven's shocking debut ""The Last House On The Left"" (1972). Both films are gripping and edgy, they are both disturbing as well as frightening. The acting in this movie, however, was better than his debut.

""The Hills Have Eyes"" released in 1977, (back when pure terror dominated over special effects) is a classic horror film that is relentlessly suspenseful.

When a families camper breaks down in the middle of nowhere on their way to California, they find themselves in a grim battle of survival when they are attacked by unruly cannibalistic mountain dwellers hungry for the fresh meat of obstinate vacationers. One by one, the family members fall prey to these inbred outlaws, until only a son and daughter remain to retrieve their kidnapped baby sister and seek revenge against the cannibals. The movie stars Dee Wallace Stone (Cujo) Susan Lanier and of course the man on the cover Michael Berryman. James Whitworth is awesome as Poppa Jupiter.

Becuase the movie was shot in 16MM it will never look fantastic but Anchor Bay's version is the best I've ever seen. Digitally remastered, this anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer is more than impressive. The soundtrack however isn't quite as impressive. Dubbed over after final cuts were made to change the MPAA rating from X to R, the music sometimes sounds distorted and muffled.

Wes Craven went on to direct some of the best horror movies in cinematic history with the 1984 classic, that brought us Freddy Krueger, ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" and the 1996 blockbuster ""Scream"" which spawned 2 sequels. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is by far Craven's most underrated film and my personal favorite of his. If you're a fan of Craven's and haven't seen ""The Hills Have Eyes""  do yourself a favor and check it out today!",1117152000,6,1904,4.900621118012422
1212865,4,B00000FZ5B,"Ah yes, the glory days of 70s drive-in horror!  They don't make em like this anymore, kids!  Hills was made back in the day when Wes Craven did good films.  Too much success and money have taken the grittiness out of him.  Now he does soft horror flicks and takes up executive producing duties on rotten flicks like They and the Carnival Of Souls remake.  Hills was made at a great time for horror films.  The acting isn't always top notch, but hey, this is low budget.  What we got here is your all American family who breakdown in the middle of the desert and are then assaulted by a not so all American family of savage cannibals.  The good family has to resort to brutality in order to survive.  Kind of a twist on the Texas Chainsaw thing.  This movie isn't exactly scary as much as it is disturbing and brutal.  The cannibal family are an interesting bunch.  Instead of having them lurk in the shadows and having them come off as boogeymen, Craven gives them quite a bit of screen time, making them a bit more human than say, a Jason Voorhees type character.  Good performances from the cannibal family, especially the always watchable Michael Berryman, who's unfortunate birth defects make him a creepy and memorable character.  In fact, I think everyone has seen Michael Berryman at one time or another, but just don't know him by name.  He's always a joy.  Anchor Bay have once again done a fantastic job by giving us some tasty features.  I haven't listened to the commentary, but there's a nice one hour documentary on the making of the film with Craven, Berryman, Dee Wallace Stone and a few others.  Also incuded is an hour documentary on Wes Craven and his career up to Music Of The Heart.  There's an alternate ending which isn't fantastic or anything, but interesting.  And of course the trailers and such.  All in all a nice piece of classic horror history that'll probably be labelled ""boring"" or ""stupid"" by folks from The Ring generation of filmgoers.  In fact, isn't The Hills Have Eyes about due to be remade into some slick, lifeless Hollywood production directed by some schmuck who's previous directorial credits include music videos and commercials?  I'm probably not too far off on that assumption, and that thought is scarier than any horror film.",1114473600,2,2275,4.660804020100502

Trailers, TV spots, alternate ending, and a 4 minute restoration demo round out this abundance of extras. The paper insert contains photos of the posters and an essay giving the insight into the film.

1212868,5,B00000FZ5B,"In all honesty, the budget of this film works wonders for it. It's a gritty, tough little film, even modest in a way... It's like Deliverance meets Last House, and like that prior, influential film- expolores the very Cravenesque motif of the 'suburban grotesque', where characters who have lived their lives in Rockwell Paintings, picking flowers from Lynchian rose-beds, are forced to fight for their survival, or forced to bleed for their beleifs. Hills, like 'Last House' plays with your moral backbone as it poses many ethical questions about the barbaric and family politics. And it is on this level, that it works quite well. In terms of content, the film , like 'Chainsaw' looks like its been edited with a hatchet and Craven's cuts certainly work well. It has dated, but its images are startilling- especially when the surviving children use the corpse of their mother (who continues to stare nonchantly...) as bait. Disturbing, with a frightening quality that pushes it above the grindhouse. Followed by a sequel which looses its efffectivness by making all the characters seem born to fight-back. It's scarier watching the innocent ones have to pick up the axe and blindly swing...

Wow, even after all these years.",1111708800,2,1226,5.039408866995074
1212939,4,B00000FZ5B,"""The Hills Have Eyes"" is Wes Craven's long awaited follow up to his first film, the grindhouse epic ""The Last House on the Left."" In the latter film, the creator of such horror staples as ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"" delved deep into the recesses of human cruelty to tell the tale of two young women abducted, tortured, and killed by a small gang of escaped convicts. Through a twist of fate, the parents of one of these girls meet up with her killers and exact their own brand of terrible revenge. ""The Last House on the Left,"" although not incredibly gory in its theatrical cut, is a nauseating, seedy little nightmare that received an incredible amount of bad press even as it raked in money at the few places willing to show the movie. Craven's subsequent career virtually assured that his early work would receive the DVD treatment. What's surprising is how comprehensive a treatment ""Last House"" and ""Hills"" received. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" offers up a plethora of entertaining and informative extras on two discs. There is so much material of interest on these DVDs that it's easy to lose sight of the film itself.

There is nothing more innocent and heartwarming than a family taking a trip across the country. In the case of retired cop Big Bob Carter (Russ Grieve), he's taking his extended family out into the desert in search of a silver mine. His wife Ethel (Virginia Vincent) is along for the ride, as are daughter Brenda (Susan Lanier) and son Bobby (Robert Houston). Also tagging along in a mobile home is Carter's married daughter Lynne (Dee Wallace-Stone), her husband Doug (Martin Speer), and their infant child. Rounding out the list are the two family dogs, one of whom will play an important role in the nightmare to come. Carter and his clan stop off at a decrepit gas station run by Fred (John Steadman) in order to ask for directions. Fred issues dire warnings to Carter about heading out into the desert. The cop, undeterred by such nonsense, proceeds to drive his entire family into the middle of an Air Force bombing range. When a couple of jet fighters buzz the Carter station wagon, Big Bob panics and veers off the road. Now stranded miles from the highway, the family takes stock of the situation. The automobile is seriously damaged, so Big Bob walks back to civilization while the family sets up camp. Listen to that terror music rise with a swell!

The Carter clan should have listened to crotchety old Fred. It turns out that a family of cannibals lives out in the mountains near where the car crashed, a family headed by Fred's only son Jupiter (James Whitworth). The gas station owner tells Bob Carter a weird story about the birth of his son, describing the youth as a cruel, misshapen child cursed with a violent temperament. Fred eventually threw the kid out into the desert after a particularly heinous crime convinced the father that the son was a real danger. Now Jupiter has a family of his own, including Pluto (Michael Berryman) and Mars (Lance Gordon), with which to terrorize anyone unlucky enough to wander into their lair. As Big Bob races back to his loved ones, the film shifts focus to the family left back on the bombing range. Sure enough, Jupiter and his abhorrent offspring swoop down on the unfortunate outsiders, killing two of the family members and stealing Lynne's baby. The rest of the film deals with the survivors' attempts to retrieve the infant and kill Jupiter and his pack of cannibals. It's a battle to the finish as Doug, Brenda, and Bobby rely on their wits to defeat stronger, better armed foes.

""The Hills Have Eyes"" is really a film about civilization versus barbarism. It's also a film based loosely on the Sawney Bean family, a real life pack of inbred cannibals who preyed on travelers over in the English isles three centuries ago. The film relies heavily on shock value rather than over the top gore, an approach that generally works even if it is a bit disappointing (I'd like to see more cannibal action, personally). And there is nothing more shocking than the frightening visage of Michael Berryman to send an audience over the edge. If I had to draw a picture of what I thought an inbred cannibal killer looked like, it would probably resemble Berryman. His misshapen bald head, buggy eyes, and malformed mouth add much to the impact of the movie. He is, in fact, almost as frightening as some of the performances in the film. Most of the actors do a good job with their roles, but Virginia Vincent goes needlessly over the top as matriarch Ethel. Talk about laying the ham on thick! Shelley Winters has nothing on this lady! I'm surprised Ethel and her relatives had to put up with cannibals at all, frankly. You would think the planes saw Big Bob go off the road and would notify the proper authorities. You would also think that a pack of cannibals couldn't survive for long on a military bombing range. Oh well, best not to ask too many questions.

The supplements on the DVD are quite good. The best feature is the commentary track with Wes Craven and producer Peter Locke. They entertain themselves endlessly by poking fun at the unfolding hijinks. After listening to their comments, check out the interviews with cast and crew, the Craven career retrospective, and the alternate ending. Every horror film fan will want to check this DVD out.

I was expecting a visibly low-budget film, that would rely more on gore and shock-value than it would terror and suspense.  I couldn't have been farther from the truth.  The movie immediatly puts the main characters in a deadly situation and never leaves.  The begining scene takes place at a gas station and it is very difficult to figure out what is happening.  This scene leaves the viewer with many questions, all of which will be answered by the film's end.  That scene is critical, becasue it builds all of the suspense and leaves the viewer wanting answers----or at least a ""safer"" situation.  I was a little disappointed by the film's ending, but after some further thought, I realize that the ending is quite good, although our survivors are still in quite a pickle.

1212943,3,B00000FZ5B,"I was a little late coming to this film -- 27 years late, having never seen it until 2004. For anyone else contemplating that event, it's not a good thing. This movie does not compete well with modern flicks. It was made on the extreme cheap, has no stars and only one recognizable actress, is not all that interesting a story, and ends abruptly in freeze frame during a high energy action sequence.

The story involves a family traveling through the desert that goes off the main road, smashes into some scrub brush and breaks and axle, the men depart to find civilization and run into  weirdos in bad makeup that happen to be cannibals and...watch it to see the rest.

According to the lengthy notes inside the two-disk package (one disk of extra talky stuff and trailers) this was one of the ""reality"" horror films of the 1970s that tried to convince viewers the horror was actually happening to a real family. This is in opposition to the historic role of horror -- to show something that could never actually happen, such as the worm from another planet that inhabits people's bodies in ""The Hidden"".

It succeeded quite well in that way in 1977 and developed a cult following that led me to watch it nearly three decades after its release.

I thought there were a number of exciting moments in this movie and relatively little gore. The movie broke some rules in animal and child scenes, another element that made it a cult favorite when Disco was king. It's no movie for children in this regard and probably too intense for people that are easily offended.

The notes also say the genre projected by this movie is showing a return in the 2003 film ""Wrong Turn"", a movie about a bunch of college kids on spring break that turn off the main road, their car breaks down, they run into weirdos with bad makeup that are cannibals and...you get the idea.

I love horror films and have loved them since I was a kid old enough to stay up late on weekends and watch movies on the channels we could get by turning the Ten-A-Rotor antenna. But this movie had hardly any effect on me other than a few points of interest. I'm glad I finally saw it, however, since I've been putting that off all my adult life.

1212947,5,B00000FZ5B,"My all-time favorite horror flick. Although there is little blood, there is enough implied and portrayed violence in it to satisfy the most callous horror movie fan.

 Although tight editing prevents us on dwelling too much on the shocking in this picture, the shock is mainly derived from the all too realistic portrayals of the Middle Class redneck Patriarchial family's slow but steady demise by a more ""primitive"" clan, whose favorite food is a Tenderloin Baby!

 The most scary scene for me is where the bigoted father runs alone back to his trailer after witnessing a murder. As he feels his heart give him pain in a pre-heart attack, we hear ""Papa Jupiter"" softly call for the father, in ""Jupe's"" gravelly voice: "" Daddy....DADDY! Help me.....DADDDDYYY! Boogie man get me! DADDDDYYYYY, HE HE HE HE HE!"" Just hearing that will send the hairs on your ""plot"" standing straight up!",1090281600,3,884,4.912751677852349

1212979,4,B00000FZ5B,"Once again, much credit to Anchor Bay, a company dedicated to giving fans what they want.  Here's a movie that badly needed some cleanup and remastering, and they've done it, plus more.
This is one of Wes Craven's early films, a kind of classic 70-style horror movie, definitely in the same sadistic vein as Craven's debut Last House on the Left, and certainly The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Overall, the film is okay, but clearly a bit amateurish and very low budget.  The effort is there, some of Craven's style is there, and it can get creepy.
A hapless, all-American family is riding through the desert (apparently Nevada, or California, it's unclear) looking for an old, abandoned silver mine someone left to them.  They find themselves way off the beaten path, right by a firing rage used by the Air Force to blow things up, and indeed, when jets start roaring overhead, they run their car off the road and crack an axel.
They're now prey for a demented group of mutant cannibals who roam the desolate landscape, killing and eating whatever they can find.  Pretty soon the family is split up, with some members out looking for help and most staying back at the car and trailer with the dogs.
The strong points are the atmosphere and the sense of dread and menace that hangs over much of the film.  This modern, happy American family is rocketed back in time and they must use their wits and might to fight back, and indeed they're driven to acts more savage than their attackers, a major theme of Last House.
Hills could clearly have benefitted from a higher budget, better acting, and better resources.  However, the grainy, low budget feel of the film lends it much appeal.
The film does drag a bit at times, and some of the acting is terrible, as expected.  The story is basic but has a kind of universal appeal.  I'm surprised there hasn't been a remake, actually, what with recent 70s horror re-releases and remakes, though I don't doubt Hollywood's bankruptcy of ideas may drive them to it.  These days remakes often jettison the very elements of the originals that made them classics, which is a shame.  While I thought the Texas Chainsaw remake was satisfying in its own way (certainly stylistically) I thought it lacked some of the suspense and menace of the original, as well as the social commentary, qualities that Hills does share.
The film is given a tremendous treatment by Anchor Bay.  The first disc contains the film in the best quality we're ever likely to see.  The picture is incredible; no more poor tape copies or appalling prints, and there are numerous sound mixes on here, depending on your preference and home setup.  It's up there with the excellent Texas Chainsaw DVD that saw a similarly grainy and faded picture give way to a totally restored print.
The second disc is full of features, most notable a lengthy documentary made in 2003 featuring Wes Craven and a good portion of the cast, including the amazing Michael Perryman who needed no makeup to play Pluto.  (Perryman was born with many physical birth defects, thus his unique appearance.)  There are trailers, TV spots, and even a neat bit where you see the before and after effects of the restoration of the film.  You can appreciate how sharp and clear the print is on this set.
Overall, another great effort by Anchor Bay.  This is a no-brainer for fans of the film, and indeed people were wondering where it was after they released Hills 2 on DVD first (a pretty poor sequel.)  Studios and directors could learn a thing or two about cult horror and sci fi films; they often get the most reverent DVD releases, and Anchor Bay has a long list of them.",1084838400,4,3645,4.65990639625585
1212980,5,B00000FZ5B,"The Carter family are on their way to a silver mine, under the guidance of patriarch / retired-cop ""Big Bob"" Carter. This is his idea of a vacation. Well, he drives them into the desert, only to get lost and run off the road. The car undrivable, The Carter's are stuck in the middle of a wasteland. Thay have a trailer full of food and drink, two german shepherds (named Beauty and Beast), two pistols, ammo, and there are seven Carters (including a baby). They'd be just fine if it weren't for the family of cannibals preparing to swoop down and wipe them out! THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a survivalist nightmare, loaded with creeping dread. The Jupiter clan is small but deadly. They are extremely vicious and conditioned to steal, kill, and eat to stay alive. The Carters are typical american suburbanites on a holiday; soft, civilized, and totally  unaware of danger. When these two families meet, it appears to be no contest, as the Carters begin dropping like blowflies. Papa Jupiter (James Whitworth), and his family (including Michael Berryman in the role that made him infamous as Pluto) see the Carters as their next big feast. However, once the murder and mayhem have taken their toll, the remnant of the Carters strike back, in ways that are equal to, if not more extreme than the evil they've endured. Even Beast goes on a rampage after Beauty is killed. The heroic canine offs two of the horrific hayseeds all by himself! The tables definitely turn in surprising ways. This movie was made way back when Wes Craven was scary. It's terror lies in the fact that it is believable. Both families seem real. Check out Dee Wallace (E.T., The Howling, Cujo, Critters) as the oldest Carter daughter. Highly recommended...",1082505600,,1721,4.736666666666666

It's the case with Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES, a film presented by Anchor Bay in a special and definitive edition. If one isn't concerned at all by the fate reserved to most of the members of the politically correct Carter family, each of the appearances of Pluto, Jupiter or another member of this degenerate family is rather surprising if not frightening.
The only problem is that the theme of THE HILLS HAVE EYES had already be magistrally treated by John Boorman 5 years before in DELIVERANCE. And that there wasn't anything to add to that masterpiece. So Wes Craven's movie suffers a lot from this comparison and if it wasn't for the quality of the acting of Michael Berryman, the film wouldn't deserve any attention.",1079481600,2,825,4.696551724137931

It isn't even laughably bad, just plain boring and annoying. You'll look across the sofa at your friend/partner and say, ""What the heck is this, and why all the hype?""
One thing does recommend the DVD version, however:  The follow-up, modern day interviews with Craven, the Producer, and the cast.  For the first ten minutes I had to ask myself whether they were serious in their praise and awe of this trash, or they were doing an Academy Award deserving spoof.

1212984,5,B00000FZ5B,"After scoring a surprise hit with his shocking debut Last House on the Left, Wes Craven wrote and directed this primitive little shocker that just like Last House on the Left managed to be shocking and truly scary.  When a suburban family becomes stranded in the desert, they fall prey to a family of cannibals, and as they're numbers quickly dwindle, fight back with equally savage means.  The Hills Have Eyes was also another social commentary by Craven as we see the typical human family revert to they're feral instincts in doing anything to survive.  A lesser known sequel would be released a few years later which Craven directed, but that film isn't worth tracking down one bit.  Anchor Bay has yet again done another fine job on restoring a horror classic to DVD; just like they did with Near Dark and Day of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes DVD is handsomely packaged and includes two discs worth of features including a commentary by Craven and producer Peter Locke, two hour long featurettes, and a plethora of trailers and TV spots.

1212985,3,B00000FZ5B,"I'm sorry, I haven't seen the DVD of this movie.
I just remember seeing two movies, back to back, back in the late '70s in a Drive-In: ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Don't Go Into The Woods"".
This became an Indie-joke between my friends and myself to refer to movies that were supposed to be cheap and scary.  I seem to remember a subliminal flash of a skull a few times during the ""Don't..."" movie also.  Some of us found the movies scary, some of us were dying to leave.  We who were dying to leave suddenly perked up and tried to spot more of the subliminal frames.  The other guys never saw them.  They weren't subtle either: In the middle of a very dark woods scene suddenly is one frame of full white with just a black skull in the middle, enough to blind you in a dark parking lot.  Even more puzzling that only two of us saw it.
Anyway, maybe ""The Hills..."" has some subliminals in it also so if you buy this movie try to keep your eyes peeled open watching for them.  There were only three or so in the other movie.
It would be a chuckle if they made it into this.",1069200000,,1069,4.110576923076923
1213052,4,B00000FZ5B,"Yes, all right, we've all seen the slasher film where the innocents becomes stranded in the back woods, and prey to a family of cannibals.
This film is a little different though. A Michael Myers or a Jason Vorhees keeps coming through onslaughts of cutlery, bullets, various blunt objects, falls from great heights, and trips underwater. They must be somehow supernatural not to be be really killed this time. I know, I know, they need to set up the sequel. But it really gets tiring after awhile, because you know the point of view characters can't ever ultimately win, despite the obligatory single surviver for the sequel. They are relentlessly pursued by these invincible monsters.
There's no sequel to The Hills Have Eyes. Even though the appearances of the slashers suggest a bit of the not-so-natural, they are, in fact, vulnerable, and beatable. This makes for real tension in this film; you really don't know how it's going to turn out. Will the beast family be destroyed, or just dented? Will even one of the victims survive to tell the tale? It's a real unknown, and it makes for some edge-of-the-seat moments that most slasher films can't deliver.",1068940800,3,1159,4.858585858585859

1213054,5,B00000FZ5B,"I saw THE HILLS HAVE EYES at the HorrorFind 2003 Convention on August 16, where I met two actors from this film, Dee Wallace Stone and Michael Berryman. Now that I own the DVD itself, I must say that this is one of Wes Craven's greatest movies that he ever made in his distinguished career. Like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE HILLS HAVE EYES explores the darker side of the family dynamic; it also explores the concept of civilization and savagery. The two families, the Carters and the mountain cannibals, both have a father figure that ultimately leads them to their respective destructions; ironically, the cannibals seem more functional than the Carters, since whereas the Carters split up whenever possible, the cannibals keep in contact with each other via radio. There are excellent performances all around, especially the aforementioned Stone (as one of the doomed Carters) and Berryman (as Pluto, the most memorable of the cannibals), as well as Susan Lanier as Brenda Carter, Janus Blythe as Ruby (the most sympathetic of the cannibals), and Robert Houston as Bobby Carter. The final moments of this movie left me in a state of shock in its display of sheer brutality and savagery!
At long last, THE HILLS HAVE EYES gets a terrific DVD release. The picture quality of this DVD is even better than it was in theaters, although a little rough around the edges! The documentary ""Looking Back On THE HILLS HAVE EYES"" is truly informative and really makes you more interested in the film itself. There's also a truly awesome U.S. trailer and a segment of ""The Directors"" on Craven among the other extras. Makes a great double feature with the original THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE! A definite must-watch!",1067299200,6,1711,4.903448275862069
1213055,5,B00000FZ5B,"Knowing today what we know about Wes Craven, his older movies are a hit-and-miss experience. Movies like ""Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" are both excellent horror movies, despite their relentless brutality and amateur-night production values. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is now available for the first time on DVD (and for the first time in over 10 years in any format), and it is a must-have for Craven fans, and horror fans in general.
By today's standards, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is tame and less shocking visually, but in terms of theme, it still packs a mean punch. It is essentially about two families: a white collar family stranded in the desert, and a cannibalistic, nomadic family who have a taste for human flesh. One must fight off the other, and it is, according to Craven, the battle between opposite ends of the food chain, where one invariably becomes the other in order to survive. The violence is tempered somewhat from ""Last House on the Left"", but there are definitely some graphic moments. The story is smartly written, the dialogue is well delivered and believable. Considering the fact that this was a low-budget movie, the acting is nothing stellar. But rarely do you get that in horror films, so it is unlikely anyone will mind. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe it to yourself to experience it. You can see how Craven's style was being formed in these early films, and you can see how it evolved in later films like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"".
If the movie itself is not the main selling point, the DVD package is. The movie has been remastered, in widescreen, taking out most of the grain and fuzz that plagued the VHS versions. On the first disc, there is the Audio Commentary by Wes Craven and ""Hills Have Eyes"" producer Peter Locke. As with most Craven commentaries, it is smart, full of anecdotes and trivia, and fun to watch. I recommend listening to the commentary before watching any of the documentaries, since most of what is told in the documentaries is repeated in the commentary and thus will make it redundant. The first documentary I watched was an episode of ""The Directors"" and it was on the career of Wes Craven. It covers his entire career up to this date, and has interviews with many people who worked with him in the past. It is fascinating, and a story that movie buffs would love to hear. It runs 60 minutes. The second is even better, and better for this DVD because it focuses exclusively on ""The Hills Have Eyes"". It is called ""Looking Back on The Hills Have Eyes"". It consists of interviews of Craven, Peter Locke, the principle cast, and other key players. How they made this movie is just as interesting as the movie itself, so fans will definitely get a kick out of it. This one also runs for almost 60 minutes. Both documentaries are well made, and worth repeated viewings.
Being a long time Wes Craven fan, I was so happy that they finally released ""The Hills Have Eyes"" on DVD. Younger horror fans, or people who favor splatter and special effects, might not warm to the film due to the age and amateur qualities of the film. But for true horror fans, this is an essential addition to your collection.",1067126400,4,3197,4.600700525394045
1213056,4,B00000FZ5B,"If you are between 25-35 years old you were a young child when this movie came out. I am 28 now, when I first saw ""The Hills have Eyes"" I was at an age where it was extremely scary. As I watch it today it still has a chill factor and remains disturbing. The location is a big part of things and adds a feeling of the characters being trapped or stranded. The desert location is amazingly creepy and atmosheric. Wes Craven's idea was good and I believe he brought it vividly to life in this classic horror film made in the late 70's. This 2 disc DVD is in DTS ES 6.1 (soundtrack), which makes for much better sound. The second disc has two featurettes: Looking back on The Hills have Eyes (&) The films of Wes Craven. Both of the featurettes are nearly one hour long each. There is also an alternate ending, which was quite interesting. I won't tell you about it, you should just take a look. Actor James Whitworth's unique look and creepy expressions allow him to easily steal the show.",1066089600,2,986,4.306451612903226
1213057,3,B00000FZ5B,"The editorial review for this film says HILLS HAVE EYES is ""highly recommended for Craven completists""- which again causes me to ask: When the heck can NZer's get to legally see LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT?, especially with  the much anticipated FREDDY VS JASON coming soon (to NZ) which sees LHOTL's Writer/ Director Wes Craven (ironically, a former Professor of Humanitarian Studies) & Producer Sean Cunningham's famous characters going one on one- isn't that a sure sign for LHOTL to be reclassified R18? OK, enough of my liberal rambling & on to the review.
Wes's next cult hit (which he also wrote) was THE HILLS HAVE EYES, which has to be one of the scariest movies I've seen. Bar none. It's not technically brilliant or anything, but in terms of the scare factor HILLS is up there with the best of 'em.
The premise is pretty basic: The Carter family are heading away on vacation when their car & trailer are run off the road in the desert when swerving to avoid hitting a cute little bunny rabbit. Stranded in the middle of nowhere, little do the Carters know they are being watched by a redneck cannibal with a walkie talkie, who memorably & menacingly purrs into the radio: ""They's done gooooood! Easy pickin's now!"" No more cornbread an' buttermilk for these yokels no mo'! Yee haw! To celebrate; the Entree on their menu is Beauty, the family dawg.
With their car temorarily out of order, Fred Carter (John Steadman) an ex-cop who served 25 years on the Force; & son Doug set off to on the long trek to get help, leaving the rest of the family behind at the mercy of the cannibals.
When Fred reaches the township, he meets an old man who recounts the tale of his wife giving birth years ago to a baby boy who ""was ten pounds & hairy as a monkey"". Fred learns that Junior's leisure pursuits extended to killing dogs, biting off chickens heads & burning down the family house. So the old man did what had to be down: he bashed in the mutant's face with a tyre iron & left it in the middle of the desert to die. Junior survived & met a lovely hairy cannibal girl & soon there was a whole family of mutant cannibals roaming the desert, among them mama Ruby (Janus Blythe), Mercury (Arthur King) & of course who could forget Pluto? (played by cult fave Michael Berryman). Must've seemed like a good idea at the time.
Now Pappy's scared that ""the devil boy's grown up to be a devil man"". Then as soon as he finishes speaking, a cannibal conviently leaps through the window & stabs him to death....
Meanwhile the rest of the family find themselves fighting for their lives & a bad situation gets even worse when the mutants  kidnap their baby with the intention of eating it. But I won't elaborate any further because that will just spoil everything.
Craven has made a geniunely frightening movie which is not for all tastes, with subject matter including numerous taboos like cannibalism, incest & infanticide; but in my opinion that's what makes the film all the more terrifying. THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a must-see for horror fans; though people of a nervous disposition are advised to pass on this one. Try and avoid the sequel, best categorized as a lesser remake which is mainly just comprised of flashback footage from #1 and was probably only released in 1985 (after being shelved for two years) to cash in on the success of ELM ST. Proof that you (usually) can't beat the original.",1065571200,5,3387,4.550819672131148
1213058,4,B00000FZ5B,"The DVD release of the THE HILLS HAVE EYES should have longtime horror fans in a state of paroxysmal nirvana.  A genre favorite from the 1970s, this gem from the early career of writer/director Wes Craven--arguably one of contemporary horror's most interesting auteurs--has garnered an admirable cult following since its initial release.
Though most critics rightly cite Wes Craven's SCREAM series as his commercial magnum opus, it would be difficult to deny that THE HILLS HAVE EYES is one of the best and most original of his early films.  In terms of commercial and professional development, Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT would most likely be cited as the seminal piece that forged the path towards A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and, specifically, the highly successful SCREAM trilogy; but in terms of personal artistic expression, psychological self-reflection, and pertinent social commentary, THE HILLS HAVE EYES is Craven's creative and aesthetic pice de rsistance.
As a cinematic work of literature, the film functions as a biting satire of the ease with which ""civilized"" humans can eject moral values and social accoutrements when it is expedient to do so.  As a horror film, THE HILLS HAVE EYES not only provides a heaping dose of scares, but it is also raw and unrelenting in its use of repulsive imagery, intense emotion, and savage violence to drive home its satirical theme.
The film is also notable for providing early roles for two thespians destined to become genre regulars.  THE HILLS HAVE EYES marked the first high-profile professional appearance on celluloid of Dee Wallace (a.k.a. Dee Wallace-Stone), better known to genre fans for starring roles in later films such as THE HOWLING, CRITTERS, CUJO, and ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.  And it introduced horror fans to Michael Berryman, an actor whose unique cranial deformities have given him the opportunity to play everything from STAR TREK aliens to demons to ambulatory cadavers, and all with a minimum of additional make-up.
To put it succinctly, THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a must-see for any serious fan of horror cinema, and Anchor Bay's DVD release is a must-own for Wes Craven fans.",1065398400,4,2155,5.110795454545454

My friend guffawed when Steadman got pulled through the window but I remember being totally traumatised by the picture, my body going into spasms in my seat. Never forget this one, it had me begging for mercy.
Pleased to report it has stood up well, with strong performances. Loss of family members is a distressing prospect for anyone, and Craven plays on this to a merciless degree. I'm not sure whether the film is an utterly immoral undertaking or offers something so fundamental it would be foolish to ignore it. Essentialy, it's a sports film, and you get a glimpse as to how the Roman bread and circuses became so popular, until ironically the barbarians abolished it. It's a team game with the baby as ball. Sudden death means exactly that. Has you clapping and cheering, you can't help it. Good psychologist is Craven. Don't know if it's a film one should recommend. All I can say, as a thriller, it is one of a kind. An absolute nerve shredder.",1064793600,3,1156,4.483412322274882

I haven't seen Wes Craven's Last House On The Left but it seems to be in the same sort of documentary/amateur horror genre. It does look very novice and it's far from Craven's best work but it is slightly interesting.
Plus, I have no clue what all the fuss is about regarding the shock and gore. There is hardly one spot of blood in this movie and I just finished watching the uncut version. Horror and gore is implied but never really shown or excessively displayed.
I kind of felt that the character of Pluto was quite sympathetic even tho he was one of the bad guys. I felt sorry for him when the dog bit him. But none of the other characters provoked anything out of me. They were just either dull or stupid and not even in a typical horror movie way. Wes Craven kind of shoots himself in the foot by limited the possibilities early on, resulting in a movie with an annoyingly abrupt ending and no subtext or subliminal quality whatsoever. It works perfectly as a Drive-In movie but as a horror it's weaker than a twentieth-time-around tea-bag.

Arrows edition looks great.  That doesn't mean the film looks great or is demo worthy but it feels like an accurate reproduction of how the film should look.

Very nice package with a poster.",1510099200,,358,4.546875
