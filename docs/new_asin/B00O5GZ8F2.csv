6724858,5,B00O5GZ8F2,"I am really glad that they have re-released both seasons of ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" TV show on DVD. It was a really cute show. My only question about the three discs released for season 2 is this: Why does Disc three have the ending episodes on it, when there should be a fourth disc to cover all of the episodes? If I am not mistaken, there were at least 23 episodes to Season 2, but so far there are only something like 17 episodes listed on the three Dics for season 2. Where are the rest of the episodes? Or was this a mistake and a fouth disc is still in the works? I would really like to have the all of the episodes for my DVD collection.",1414972800,8,645,3.9692307692307693
