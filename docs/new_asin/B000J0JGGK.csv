2664570,5,B000J0JGGK,"I have taught fitness classes for over 20 years and this is the best DVD workout I have ever tried.  I bought it to use when doing weight work with a friend at home and we both ""hate"" (love) it!  Cathe is great at motivating you while giving excellent instruction on performing each exercise safely and effectively.  Do the workout without weights until you can complete all repititions of the exercises...then slowly add weights to really see results.  I have given this DVD to other friends who have asked my advice on toning their legs and abs.  We have a few of Cathe's other DVD workouts (which we love too), but this one is the best.",1196121600,10,639,4.474137931034483
2664571,5,B000J0JGGK,"I am a training/workout DVD fanatic with a collection of 50+, and growing...AND Cathe Friedrich's ""Butts & Guts"" is by far THE best when it comes to training the lower body and abs! She had my glutes, hamstrings, quads, and entire core were screaming! For a moment I had to ask myself what was I thinking?! Sweat was pouring from my body, as this really gets your heartrate up. Therefore it has a cardio element which made me burn almost 900 calories from start to finish, and this was without being able to complete all of the exercises.

This is a long and intense workout, but definitely never a dull moment. This DVD has definitely made an improvement in my training in every aspesct. There are some bonus segments incorporate som ab work on the stability ball, classic Cathe moves such as Sit & Stands and Step Ups on the ever lovely Hi-Step.
I really love the fact that she has added pre-mixes and you have the option to choose which exercises you want to do.

Generally, I am a Jari Love ""Get Ripped...Series"" devotee, as I have all of her DVD's (I am anxiously awaiting the release of ""Chiseled."" However, I found that Cathe Friedrich definitely pushes you past your comfort zone in training moreso that Jari Love. I burn more calories and feel challenged beyond belief!!!

This was the first Cathe Freidrich DVD I ordered and since investing  in ""B&G"" I have added ""Muscle Max"" from her Hardcore Series. LOVE IT!!! I am planning to order more of her DVD's when my budget allows because her DVD's are more expesive compared to others, but my body, mind and spirit are so worth it. DVD is WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!! Highly Recommended!! Cannot wait to see the results!!",1192752000,7,1671,4.597315436241611
2664572,5,B000J0JGGK,"As everything from cathe, this is intense, leg burning and great for advanced practitioners. I recomend all Cathe videos if you want something beyong the conventional workouts!!",1187049600,,177,5.592592592592593
2664573,5,B000J0JGGK,This DVD means business! If you really want to get down to business then this dvd is for you. I like this better then the firm dvds. I have not gotten anywhere near finishing this dvd and I am sweating up a storm. I hope to buy more of her dvds real soon.,1185148800,,255,3.830188679245283
2664574,5,B000J0JGGK,"This is my first Cathe video but not my last!  I love workout videos and as a dancer, this targets all the right areas.  There's a section for lower-body both standing and floorwork and an abs section followed by stretching.  Up to you if you want to do the entire video.  I do, and it takes about an hour and a half.  Cathe isn't annoying at all and goes at a great pace too.  The only issue for some people might be equipment because she uses a 35lb barbell, hand weights (she uses 5lbs), a step, band, ball and ankle weights.  I know it's a lot but I think that's why I like it so much, you don't get bored and it really does work.  You'll feel the burn:)",1182816000,9,658,4.046511627906977
2664575,5,B000J0JGGK,"Cathe Friedrich is my absolute favorite for working out.  This workout is hard -- you feel it right away. It is put together very well, in that you can select the exercises yourself or just hit 'play' and do the entire video.  Her personality is great -- she is very motivating, without being ""chatty."" I discovered Cathe by watching FitTV, and now own many of her DVDs.  I just purchased this one as my problem areas are lower body.  You will need various equipment, though: a high step, dumbells, barbell, stretch band, and stability ball. Since I have been exercising to Cathe, I have eventually purchased all equipment and use them all regularly.  I highly recommend this DVD and any of the Cathe Friedrich items!!!",1173052800,27,719,4.72
2664576,5,B000J0JGGK,"WOW what a workout.. i have a lot of Cathe's workouts but this one really works the Butts and Guts.. i had to do this dvd 2x to really feel the burn.. the first time i was not concentrating on the target areas but when i did the next time, i couldn't walk right for 2 days.. this is truly an excellent dvd.. you will WORK your butt area and you will get that six pack, just eat clean for better results.. Enjoy!",1172102400,13,411,3.963855421686747
2664577,5,B000J0JGGK,This is an excellent exercise DVD.  I'm a beginner but I was able to follow all the exercises and I really felt my muscles working.  I highly recommend this DVD. There are several pieces of equipment demonstrated but I found I could get by with a balance ball and exercise bands.  As I get more advanced I will add the hand weights.  Don't let the equipment keep you from trying this exercise routine.  Cathe Friedrich really knows her stuff.,1168905600,15,442,4.544303797468355
2664578,4,B000J0JGGK,"If you have seen my other Cathe reviews, you'll know that I think she is fantastic and makes you work hard, yet she's motivating and keeps it interesting.  In this dvd, you will work your trouble spots very hard and it is tough (but well worth pushing through).  The results can be found if you do the workout often.

There is a wide spectrum of exercises here.  Every possible movement is done (like your squats and lunges etc) and you will be feeling it in no time.  You start with standing workout that work the glutes and then classic floor moves like side leg lifts and inner thigh work.  You WILL fatigue your muscles (in a good way).  Following all of this, there is intense ab work and she uses hand weights and ankle weights to up the ante.

The other thing you should know, is that there is a lot of equipment needed (one reason I dropped a star in the rating).  You need different amounts of weights, barbell, stability ball, resistance bands and a high step platform.  Personally for me, if I need this much equipment, I'd rather go to the gym.  Cathe is one tough trainer, but she will give you results.  After doing this workout for the first time, I didn't think I'd be able to make it out of bed the next morning.  It was a good sore, so you know you've worked out well.  I really recommend this, but not if you haven't used your glute or ab muscles in some time.",1161820800,70,1379,4.294573643410852
2664579,3,B000J0JGGK,This product seemed to be a great workout but I wasn't aware of the additional products need to have a successful workout.,1445212800,2,122,4.590909090909091

2664582,3,B000J0JGGK,I enjoy Cathe's workouts but this one requires a lot of gear & space to do at home.  I'm trying to workout with a 2 year old running around and getting the weights and everything set up is a pain bc there's not enough room to do it in my guest room like I usually do with workoit DVDs.,1424131200,3,285,3.830508474576271

2664586,5,B000J0JGGK,"this is definitely a tough routine, I cannot do half of all the reps required so I have much to work up to, which makes me happy. I like her training style, for me its totally motivating, which is crucial for workouts at home.",1417478400,,226,4.159090909090909

2664590,5,B000J0JGGK,Great item,1410048000,,10,4.5
2664591,4,B000J0JGGK,"Though stuff. After the first 35 minutes I couldn't move so I had to take a break of a few days to recover. I'm scared to start again, lol! This was worth the money, but as others have said you do need a lot of equipment. For me, I improvised and did my best with what I had. So much better than annoying Jillian Michaels (no offense to those of you who enjoy jillian's constant yappin).
When I say it was worth the money, I mean this is a well made dvd with good workout rutines that will not bore your muscles.",1405468800,9,512,4.029411764705882
2664592,5,B000J0JGGK,"I really like this video.  She kicks your but - literally.  The only downfall I have with it is picking the workouts.  There are times when there is not enough time to do the whole video so I like to pick and choose sections.  This is a little confusing to me, but I think I'm getting it all figured out.  Overall, I love the workouts and will be purchasing more Cathe in the future.",1403481600,2,383,4.121621621621622
2664593,5,B000J0JGGK,"This is a wonderful workout... It works out places I didn't know I hadn't been working out.... & I work out daily! I thought I wouldn't like using so many different equipment, but its inexpensive items and they work my body differently & wonderfully. Yes, you will sweat and you will do some huffing and puffing, when it seems like too much pause the dvd and get a drink of water and then get right back to it... You are going to feel like you really accomplished something, your body is going to be oh sooo happy! DRINKS LOTS OGF WATER and breathe in and out deeply when you pause. I am VERY happy I added this to my workouts",1403395200,3,626,4.225
2664594,5,B000J0JGGK,"This one from Cathe is on my new #1 list. My lower body has always been my problem spot and she knows exactly how to get the entire lower body burning! I would suggest stretching longer when finished than she does if you are new to this intense of a workout, otherwise you will not be able to sit or move.",1399593600,2,305,4.016393442622951
2664595,5,B000J0JGGK,I love all of cathe's dvd's! The tapes are always fun and challenging. You know her tapes are going to be top quality. Thanks again amazon!!!,1395187200,2,141,4.461538461538462
2664596,5,B000J0JGGK,"This is my first Cathe F workout but it will not be my last. I am a huge Jillian fan and consider myself at intermediate level. Tried Butts and Guts to change up my routine,  being that I am working on my abs and butt. I only did the 45 minute ab and glute premix. I had to stop several times on the lunges and ab workouts. Cathe cues well and is so encouragingly  pleasant.. I felt the burn in my body last night after doing it. I woke up this morning and my glutes and abs are more sore than they have ever been since i started working out. It hurts to sit but I love it!! At this rate, I have room to improve and last longer. This is definitely staying in my rotation for a long time.

I would not recommend this for a beginner.
I didn't like the fact that I needed a workout ball, workout band, steps AND dumbbells  for it but I improvised with dumbbells and a short ottoman.
This is a a great DVD and Cathe knows how to get you digging all in those muscles and give them a good working out!!!",1391385600,6,997,3.97
2664597,5,B000J0JGGK,"Needs equipment. ball is good to have. and light dumbbells. ankle straps amd a riser. i use my.couch as a tall riser but I'll probably buy one. no nonsense boot camp style - do the reps, do some.more. best ab work out over new trainers! plus some quick work out mixes. love love love!!",1385856000,2,285,4.296296296296297
2664598,5,B000J0JGGK,"As the title suggests, this DVD focuses on your butt and your gut. It is not cardio, nor is it super-intense weight training.  Rather it is its own breed of video but it still has me dripping in sweat and trembling from exhaustion.  There are 31 minutes of standing glute work followed by 19.5 minutes of floor work and 14 minutes of abs.  There are also a couple bonuses: stability ball abs (15 min) and bonus lower body (5 min).  This work-out REALLY does its job!  I noticed a firmer, more shapely backside after mixing this in my rotation, about twice to three or four times a month.  This does a great job of targeting the glute muscles from several different angles.  It also hits the quads and hamstrings (as they are all connected) and of course the abs.  Butts and guts is a solid work-out that can be tacked on to another work-out in pieces or endured all at once.  However you take it, I highly recommend it for strong and shapely legs.

Pros:
Very effective.  If you want a more shapely and firmer behind, doing this work-out will definitely help you on your way.

Cons:
It is a bit long.  To do all the ""regular"" DVD with no bonuses is just over an hour (about 75 min).  Not too long, but longer than the time I usually allot to work-out.

Intensity Factor:
8 out of 10 (assuming you use weights that challenge you)

(Currently I use much heavier weight than Cathe does for most of the exercises.  Initially this was not true, but I have worked up to it.  In the beginning she uses 5lbs for lunges.  I use 8 or 10lbs.  She uses 35lbs (I think) for deadlifts and I use 65lbs.  Likewise for squats.  Later she puts on 2.5lb ankle weights.  I put on 4lb ankle weights and use an extra 10lb dumbell for some of the exercises.  I also put my ankle weights on at the start of the floor work, rather than waiting until she does a few exercises in.  So don't be afraid to up the weight (or add extra) to keep the intensity factor up for you!)",1379289600,14,1947,4.2684931506849315
2664599,4,B000J0JGGK,ENJOYED THIS WORKOUT ALSO. HARD WORK. IT GETS YOU TO WORKOUT MORE HARDER THEN YOU THINK YOU CAN LOVE IT.,1371427200,,104,4.25
2664600,5,B000J0JGGK,"I'm a 52 year old female; fairly out of shape and about 20+ lbs overweight.  I've been doing 1/2 to 1 P90X/Brazil Butt Lift routine every day now for about 3 weeks.  Thought I'd try something new.  Optimally you'll need a variety of fitness equipment as other reviewers have noted; I have been acquiring various fitness equipment over the last 10 years ago when I lost about 60 lbs on my own which took a year (mainly via skipping meals--I don't recommend it as my hair suffered for it) so the equipment necessary was no big deal for me.

I love the routines and the variety of moves.  The hamstring work is most challenging for me.  The firewalkers were fun--I was kind of used to that movement due to the ""High and Tight"" on the Brazil Butt Lift.  This video is definitely not beginner material, although you can modify it to be a beginner's workout--you can't get discouraged, though.",1355702400,4,887,4.540880503144654
2664601,3,B000J0JGGK,"I bought this DVD and paid the $25 for it because I wanted an effective workout. Personally, I don't feel like it was worth the money. The DVD requires all sorts of ""props"" like a step, a ball, a resistance band and a barbell. I'm sorry, but where do you buy a barbell? I looked at major stores like Target, Walmart and could not find one.  Also, I thought there would be variations of the exercises without the props but there wasn't so that was disappointing. So I just spent $25 and still have to go out and spend more bucks on the equipment. I'm sure the exercises are effective but I gave it three stars because I feel like there are too many focuses on what props you need to use next instead of actually working out. Just my two sense.",1347840000,11,742,4.225352112676056
2664602,5,B000J0JGGK,"Whew! I haven't been working out for a few weeks and decided to get back to it this week. Rather than easing into things, I decided for my first day back to do Butts and Guts. I skipped the entire second round of exercises in the first part and didn't keep up in lots of other areas, didn't use ankle weights, etc. but even so -- OUCH!!  I could hardly walk the next three days and going up and down stairs was agony. Today, four days later, I'm still feeling it. I guess I overdid it, huh. However, I must say even though it was hard work, I really enjoyed the workout. Cathe is so positive, has terrific cuing, doesn't chatter, and works out hard herself. I do a lot of calisthenic-style workouts and this is definitely one of the best. Cathe mixes it up and I didn't get bored. I will take it easier next time and I hope one day to look back on this review and think to myself, ""Wow, I've come a long way since then!""",1334275200,3,920,4.111111111111111
2664603,4,B000J0JGGK,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level fitness.

I have quite a few workouts by this instructor.  As always, low key, minimal chatter, good cuing.  ""Backup dancers"" are non-annoying although a few too many of them.  Good quality DVD, good camera work, music with a beat to follow.

Pros:  I enjoyed this workout although it seemed like the easiest I have done by this instructor so far.  That said, her workouts are usually super tough so this one was still good.  Liked the lower body focus.

Cons:  Lot of equipment used which was not really necessary (did not enhance the workout that much and nearly the same without.)  That said, you always have the option not to use all the equipment.  I never use the band (dislike the band) or barbell (do not have one) and substitute free weight moves.",1315267200,6,808,4.692857142857143
2664604,5,B000J0JGGK,This dvd is excellent. Cathe gets to the exercises and explains what part of the glutes is being worked on and doesn't talk about stuff that does not pertain to what she is doing like other workout dvds. The workout is tough but you do feel where the exercises are targeting. I highly recomment this dvd.,1307836800,4,304,4.446428571428571
2664605,5,B000J0JGGK,"this workout is deff great if you need some help with your tushy! I workout 7 days a week, to workouts like insanity, turbo/jam, jillian michaels, tae-bo, anything that will keep me challenged. I would recommend this for something to add to your routine once or twice a week, if you do it everyday it will build your muscles witch since im 4'11/female, thats not something i need.  She has this dvd set up that you can do all of it, or just stand/floor work,pick a sequence from the list and then goes right back to the list for you to choose another, or pre-mixed workouts.  My mother actually had this workout and i did it when i lived with her and since now i don't i had to buy it so i still have it.  So its really good. Even if your a beginner you have the option of only doing some so there's no excuse.",1300838400,4,810,4.146496815286624
2664606,5,B000J0JGGK,"I'll admit it, I'm an exercise fanatic and I love long, intense workouts.  This workout clocks in at about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Never fear though, there are lots of premixes for those who prefer a shorter workout.

What I enjoyed about this workout:

**the fun warm-up using the stability ball.  You're moving the ball in different directions and it really stretches your muscles.

**the leg exercises sneak up on you.  Those first few one legged squats with a 5 lb. weight don't seem so bad and then all of a sudden - ouch - your muscles are screaming.

**the variety of leg exercises.  You'll use a barbell, light dumbbells, ankle weights, a resistance band and your own body weight.  If you don't have all that equipment, you can always use what you do have.

**the split of standing leg work, weighted/lying down leg work and core.  It's easy to break up the workout.

**the plank work in the core section.  I've found plank work to be the most effective for my core, but I won't do it on my own because it's hard!

**the bonus core section.  It's a fun way to mix up your core workout.

**the bonus leg section.  If you're feeling particularly energetic and want that extra burn.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting a tough, yet fun leg and core workout.  With all the premix options and bonus sections, you won't get bored with this workout.",1283817600,9,1361,4.522633744855967
2664607,5,B000J0JGGK,"I LOVE THIS DVD!!  Cathe is my new favorite!  She really knows what works.  My butt was flat as a pancake before this dvd!  I am a runner, and this workout still leaves my muscles shaking!  This is a lonnng workout.  I usually break it in two and do the standing workout on a separate day then the floor work. You will be burning!  You need a lot of equipment for most of Cathe's workouts.  This is a MUST have!!  It is not for the beginner that is for sure!",1281398400,6,458,4.0
2664608,4,B000J0JGGK,"I am actually coming back to revise the rating from 5 to 1 star because of DVD quality.  It skips and freezes constantly.  It gets so bad that the whole DVD actually goes completely blank and all I can do is to take it out.  I wasn't sure for a long time what was causing this - is it my DVD player, is it the DVD or am I crazy?  Now I have a new DVD player and my husband tested on over 25 DVDs. So now I know for a fact that it is the DVD.
I own 2 DVDs by Cathe Fredrich - Body Max 2 and Butts & Guts.  I returned and re-ordered BM2 three times.  Butts & Guts, well, I give up.  That is it.  I cannot keep on returning and re-ordering DVDs like this.  Does anyone else have this problem or is it just me?  Her DVDs skip, stop, freeze and go completely blank.  Really horrible.

UPDATE: The content of DVD is fine.  It is the quality of DVD I have an issue with.  It seems unfair that I should give  one star.  So I changed to 4 starts.",1279065600,2,937,3.752577319587629
2664609,5,B000J0JGGK,"Like all of Cathe's workouts, this video is meant to be very challenging. Butts and Guts is extremely demanding and difficult and is meant to be that way. I have never been able to get through this entire workout at once. I divide it up over two nights. It's just too hard and I have to take many breaks. I am NOT a beginner either! These workouts are so grueling. You will burn a ton of calories and your legs will be shaking. Cathe does NOT mess around!!",1267315200,5,456,4.193181818181818

Their is now definition in my gluteaus maximus and my hamstring/thighs where their was none. Cathe's is no joke when it comes to the squats and low-ends. I'm excited to see what form of shape my butt will take once I get down to my goal weight. I also lost 2 inches off of my stomach it seems like in 3 weeks from Cathe's ab/core work as well. Cathe works you hard. She is crazy with those squats and low ends! I also liked the other excersize with the resistant band, i think was called the fire-walkers. This DVD is getting easier for me to finish. Cathe really puts you in shape.",1259798400,5,708,4.1678832116788325

2664612,5,B000J0JGGK,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, you need a lot of equipment to do Cathe F.'s workouts, but once you have the equipment, her workouts are top-notch, and this one is no exception.

What I especially love about this DVD are the various premixes.  On its own, the regular workout is too long for me to squeeze in, even on a day when I'm working legs, but the premixes provide wonderful workouts that really hit your legs, glutes, and abs from every angle.

As usual, Cathe makes this workout fun.  She's a little more serious in this one than in some of her others, but it's an effective workout nevertheless.",1255824000,,610,4.568807339449541

Cathe motivates me to do it, she is very energetic and upbeat and you'll enjoy doing the exercise I bet ya. If you are a beginner like me you don't need any of that equipment.

2664614,5,B000J0JGGK,I own several Cathe Freidrich exercise DVDs.  She offers a tough workout that targets specific areas named on the DVD.  She's funny and interesting and makes you feel like you're working with a private trainer.  I'll be buying more of her DVDs.,1252800000,,244,4.761904761904762
2664615,5,B000J0JGGK,"I have many (hundreds) of exercise DVDs because I'm addicted to them and love to try the latest and greatest. I hadn't done this one in a while, but when I did recently I realized again how great it is and that Cathe is truly in a league of her own. I do have some favorites among other instructors, but they still can't touch her. I think this is the best lower body and abs workout there is. While it is tough it's never boring, I don't know how she does it, but time just flies by. It uses a variety of equipment - but I have all of it and therefore love to use it. I hate the gym (machines, treadmill - boring! Other people's sweat - yuck!) and would recommend to buy the equipment, it's worth every penny. These days you can get a ton of stuff super cheap online - it beats a gym membership any day! This workout rocks!",1247184000,4,824,4.061349693251533
2664616,5,B000J0JGGK,"I have to admit, I'm a little scared of Cathe. :p  Even though I own several of her other DVDs, I know that her workouts are advanced, so I expected to be worked out both HARD and HEAVY by this video.  While Butts & Buts definitely IS a challenging workout, I was actually pleasantly surprised to discover that Cathe actually doesn't necessarily heavy up on her weights here--in fact, many of the exercises are done without weights at all, and you will likely get both aerobic and strength training benefits from this workout.  Cathe does use quite a bit of equipment in this DVD, including dumbbells, a barbell, a high step, a resistance band, and ankle weights.  However, most of the exercises can be modified if you don't have all of the above at home (I don't have a barbell, and the resistance band is only used for one exercise in the main workout).

The main workout of Butts & Guts consists of a Warm Up (6 minutes), Standing Glute Work (31 minutes), Floor Work (19.5 minutes), Abs (14 minutes), and Stretch.  There are also two Bonus segments, Bonus Stability Ball Abs (15 minutes) and Bonus Lower Body (6 minutes).  Because the Warm-Up uses the stability ball, I found it to be quite different from Cathe's other warm-ups and more fun; it also nicely stretched out the upper body as well as the lower.  The specific exercises in the workout are listed below.

Standing Glute Work:
*walking lunge w/plie jump
*1-legged squat w/foot on high step
*forward thrusting hammer punch lunges
*squats with barbell
*walking lunge w/plie jump (fewer reps)
*deadlift w/barbell & toes on dumbbell
*1-legged squat w/foot on low step
*side hammer thrusting lunges
*front-side-back lunge combo
*squats with barbell
*firewalkers (side steps w/band around ankles)
*low pulse lunges

Floor Work:
*outer thigh raises with ball
*hamstring tucks with feet on ball
(add ankle weights)
*hamstring raises with one foot on riser
*inner thigh lifts
*various leg lifts on all fours (straight, bent, elbows, hydrant)

Abs:
(start with ankle weights & 5# dumbbells)
*rollbacks w/punch across
*arm & leg lowers
*leg tucks
*torso twists
(remove ankle weights)
*side obliques
*crunches
*frog-style crunches
*knee-up pulses
*toe reaches
*plank series

Bonus Stability Ball Abs (includes prone lifts, roll outs, torso twists, oblique lifts with stability band, lying side twists, crunches with feet on ball, ball exchange, ball holds)

Bonus Lower Body (Sit-n-Stretch, Leg Press, Glute Squeezes)

Finally, the DVD includes the following three Premix options:
*Standing Glutes & Abs Timesaver, 49.5 minutes
*Overall Legs, 65 minutes
*Leg Blast, 47.5 minutes
*Floor Work & Abs, 59.5 minutes

As noted above, I really enjoyed this workout.  My only real complaint has to do with the length:  the main workout, WITHOUT the bonuses, is almost 80 minutes long!!!  Even leaving off the Abs segment, the lower body workout alone is still over an hour, and none of the premixes is less than 45 minutes long.  I actually would've preferred this workout if Cathe had just focused on the lower body work and left out the core work entirely (just Butts, no Guts, LOL!), but that's just my personal preference.  Luckily, all of Cathe's DVDs feature a ""Mix & Match"" option, so I can just select the chapters that I want to do on any particular day.

If you are looking for a highly effective workout that is sure to target every area of your lower body, you can't miss with this DVD; definitely recommended!",1240185600,32,3466,4.9311531841652325

2664619,5,B000J0JGGK,"Cathe Friedrich workouts are all fantastic, but this one is phenominal.
With dedication, you will have the firm, uplifted butt you have always strived for but never quite got with other target exercise dvd.

A stability ball, 5 lb dumbells, barbell and resistance band and a tall step are used for the exercises that get you results.

She uses the basic squats and lunges, but she also incorporates them with other standing exercises like ""firewalkers"" with the resistance band tied around your ankles as you walk and walk/squat from side to side.  You will not only feel the burn but you will target muscles in your glutes that you never knew you had because you just keep working them from all angles.

Format: Warm up 6 mins (Really fun with the stability ball for core work).
  Standing Glute work: 31 mins.
  Floor work (Leg and but lifts) 19 1/2 mins
  Core work 14 mins
  Stretch 8 mins
  Bonus stability ball Abs 15 mins
  Bonus lower body 6 mins

You can tailor you workout to the time you have.

At the end of this workout you will feel stronger, firmer, and empowered.
(and sore, but in a good way!!)

Its motivating, challenging but more importantly, fun so you will stick with it and use it again and again.",1236816000,2,1220,4.539170506912442

If you want results and you are serious, then Cathe (any Cathe DVD) is for you.  When Cathe dvd's claim advanced, it is because they are truly advanced.

2664622,3,B000J0JGGK,"Cathe uses every exercise known to tighten those buns!!  And, the core workout is also very thorough.  I'm in my 60's and have abdominal definition so I know this tape works!",1222905600,5,174,4.580645161290323
2664623,5,B000J0JGGK,"My dvd just came in today and I was psyched to get into it right away. After doing the whole workout, I have to say that while this dvd is pricey compared to others, it's worth the extra cost if you're a serious intermediate/advanced exerciser because you get a butt for your buck!

Hah. Cheesy, yes, I know. But as I sit here with a very tired lower body that's bound to experience some soreness it hasn't felt in a long time, I can confidently recommend this workout to anyone wanting to tone themselves from the waist down.

One thing you need to know about these workouts though - you use quite a bit of equipment! Cathe uses a high step (the square one), a band (a really long, wide sort of band, rather than tubing), a body bar, weights, and ankle weights. If you're working out on a floor, you'll need a mat too. That said, I only have a regular rectangular step and that worked fine. I used the tubing sort of band rather than the kind Cathe used. Note - if you don't have any bands at all, then get the other version of this DVD that comes with the proper band because the one she uses is really long. If you don't have a body bar, you can always use free weights instead. If you don't have ankle weights - no worries, the exercises are pretty hard as is!

Just some general comments on the content - it was overall really great.  You start off with a pretty good warm-up that lasts a few minutes, and then get right into standing exercises for the glutes. It's about 30 minutes and it involves a LOT of squatting and lunge repetitions. On the one hand I was hoping for a little more variation with the exercises, but then, I still got a REALLY good workout in the end. Next is glute-work on the floor. Equally intense! This one's just under 20 minutes. Then there's a core segment - about 15 minutes - dedicated to abs. It honestly wasn't as painfully intense as I had hoped it would be - however - still very challenging! After that there's a stretch portion which is relaxing and effective (she spends about 8 minutes here which I think is a good amount of time). Lastly, there's a few bonus sections - one is stability ball abs and the other is more lower body stuff. They're considerably shorter and therefore really great options if you're short on time but still need the workout. In fact, doing only 1 or 2 of any of the above segments is a sufficiently tough workout, and I'm starting to wonder if I didn't really need to do the entire dvd. Ah, but I couldn't help it, I got hooked!!

All in all, the workout was great, and Cathe = awesomeness. :)",1218412800,17,2565,4.291322314049586

Even though most of Cathe's dvd's are advanced, don't let that stop you if you're a beginner or just getting back into working out again.  Because it is so advanced, you can definitely grow with it and increase the difficulty level with heavier handweights/barbell once you become stronger.  My first try, I only made it throught the first 30 minutes and the next day, I really felt how it worked every major muscle in my legs (except my calves).  I really have become a fan of Cathe Friedrich and highly recommend this to everyone.",1200441600,7,614,4.554545454545455

I go heavier on my weights to stay challenged.  I just tried one of the premixes (which I've never done before) and #ouchy!
With the all the premix options and variety, this truly is a great workout.  There's a lot of tough old school moves that you don't find in more recent workouts.

As I have aged (50+) abdomen elasticity turned flabby and loose.  :-(  Of course when I started, I could not complete 14mins of abs continously. TIRED!! But I kept going, they are not difficult to do, but requires endurance. I found I using this dvd on a consistence basis (2-3xs weekly)has made a difference in my core and thighs.
Chapter have the exercises separated, so you don't have to do the full 70 mins. but can pick and choose. unfortunately, no customizing.  Warm up (stability ball & squats) deadlifts, lunges,walking lunges,  floor abs, cooldown = stretch w/ yoga positions. As you build your endurance add weights. you will need weights and an elastic band for the lunges.
The floor abs touches the whole core (upper,middle,obliques,bottom,lower back) planks are included....yikes all about 14mins.  If you are over 50YO, ..do what u can use your own body weight and work your way up. Cardio is keeping weight gain at bay, but strength training like butts & guts will keep those areas toned like ernestine shepherd....my 80+ exercise hero ",1472342400,,1223,4.907766990291262
