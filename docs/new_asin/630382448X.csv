Now say we sprinkle in postman general/diabetes extraordinaire Wilfred Brimley to spice things up. Clearly this is a film you'd give your right eye for. Since we'd like to think we have an eye for detail, we can officially confirm that it does exist! In a perfect storm of horrible acting and disillusionment the world has delivered us this combination platter in Mutant Species. It's about as fine as Chini takeout on a crisp October evening back in 95 with your best comrades. Yet another barely known classic from the 90's that you could only catch between 1-4 am...which would be after hardcore t.v. but before the end of Don West's card auction. Surely this is the type of film Sid's third member would catch late night at work, say how awesome it was, and then have no idea what the title was.

Mutant species opens in a tense scene as a secret government agency prepares to package a deadly foreign liquid into the #1 Camps can. To ensure it's properly disposed of, they enlist the help of an army secret ops unit led by Mike Norris cousin Mark Norris. Naturally they have a big-time problem when they accidentally unleash the mutant banana juice, turning one of their crew into a beastly creature. With the beast on the prowl they call in reinforcements lock stock and barrel. However this doesn't nothing bury infuriate the monster forcing him to lops heads off left and right. Now when tying to picture this monster envision a d-grade pumpkinhead infused with the head of a werewolf/dog type creature. With the cheapest materials possible they slapped this thing together with hilarious results. On top of it's stellar looks the beast has super human strength, 50 foot leaping abilities, and enough brute force to knock down trees after a bull rush. Seriously...it knocks down trees, we're not referring to the time Sid the third ran into the tree and cursed us because of our video machines. Despite the creatures murderous ways it still has human emotions in tact. This is seen in the closing brawl where the creature decides to finish himself off due to the havoc it had caused. It straps a bomb to it's chest and salutes Mark Norris, it actually salutes him!, before blowing itself into oblivion.

When the end credits role introducing a plethora of unknown actors, all you can do is applaud and shout Bravo...or even Dino Bravo. It was another piece of mounting evidence proving 90's B horror is some of the finest available in any decade. These films are so consistently bad that you have no choice but to love them. It's almost as if the 90's abandoned the thought of making a horror movie scary and decided the approach should be to make us laugh for an hour and a half. And that is the exact reason why we love these movies. It's simply a great way to relax and burn a few brain cells. If you're lucky enough to come across Mutant Species we implore you to move forward on a viewing. At the very least you get to hear Wilfred Brimley in his usual hilarious fashion playing an army general, you will not be disappointed.",1312243200,4,3644,5.368881118881119
713283,1,630382448X,...but not much worse.  Good for watching if you need something as background noise; not good enough to watch by itself.,1305417600,,120,4.714285714285714
713284,2,630382448X,"I picked this little flick up earlier today at the local video store. After reading the synopsis on the back of the cover, I couldn't refuse, your promised with not only some freaky dog thing...but also a futuristic movie set in 2003!!!! Wait...2003... Yea, its a flick from the 90s.

Anyway, plot is rather basic. New type of DNA is being tested in a large cover up/consipracy. Team of soldiers thinks there in a mission in an extotic land but they quickly learn the truth afterwards. The team leader finds the DNA, gets infected, kills all but one of his group, transforms into weird dog/mantis/kangaroo/cat/human beast. Last soldier finds help from two locals and soon all hell breaks lose...yea...you know the story.

The acting...well... If you want good acting, go watch something else. Effects are average, the CGI ""DNA"" looks pretty bad (thankly, its the only CGI in the movie). The monster suit is well crafted and stands high in rankings as one of the best suitmated monsters from the 1990s.

On a small portion of the creature, I only managed to find parts from a few animals. The basic one being wolf. But if you watch, you can see some wild cat, mainly in the nose/mouth area. One of the arms seems to be a claw like that of a mantis, while the other is a normal, three fingered monster hand. I'd also say it has some kangaroo mixed in, as the creature is an EXCENLENT jummper.

While this movie is no were near gold status, I would advize for the casual B-movie fans to atleast rent it. As for anyone else interested, I'd say rent also, if anything, simply for the monster.",1129334400,5,1587,4.577464788732394

The plot is a little hard to describe, but some goo leaks from a container following a crash and turns a guy into a monster.  You'll see some great acting from an unexpected source.",1463443200,,348,4.2272727272727275

He soon exhibits odd behavior, and starts bleeding from various orifices. Death ensues. MUTANT SPECIES is a sci-fi / thriller containing a vast government conspiracy, a military cover-up, and a mutating man / monster on a rampage. It's chock full of oozing, squirting, gooshy goodness! Co-stars Willford Brimley (THE THING) and Powers Boothe (WEB OF DECEPTION, FRAILTY) as an oblivious general and a nefarious government type respectively. Also, watch for Denise Crosby (TV's STAR TREK TNG, PET SEMETARY, MORTUARY) as a helpful country gal! Worth a viewing.

There is the tough female, that has to be rescued by her kid brother, while she was being held prisoner by the monster and she tells the kid 'no I have to stay here, he'll kill me' (if she escapes vs staying there with the monster).

7853564,2,630382448X,"Not very good, but not horrible. SPOILERS follow!!!

A unit of soldiers are sent to recover classified material from a rocket crash, which turns out to be mutant DNA, and the guy in charge has orders to kill everyone once the material is found. The ""hero"" was pretty lame. For a lieutenant who supposedly is so skilled, etc., he was pretty wimpy. He had the chance to kill the bad guy soooooo many times and didn't. Seriously!? Bad guy killed the whole unit, but ""hero"" just leaves him knocked out, but not tied up or anything and walks away. Then bad guy keeps hunting ""hero"" down and kills the only other survivor and still, ""hero"" doesn't take the shot. Finally ""hero"" shoots him once the guy is screaming at him to kill him as he is transforming into a monster. Torso shot, but just once, and, of course, walks away and the bad guy finishes the transformation and is alive.

So, the monster rampages and kills, quite easily, another unit of soldiers who were sent to eliminate the monster and any witnesses. Yet, somehow, the ""hero"" manages to survive a fight with the monster and momentarily incapacitates him by stabbing the monster in the foot. And then he runs away, AGAIN. He is supposedly trying to get the monster to run after him and trip a wire for a claymore mine. Dude, how about shooting the monster a lot and then cutting off his head? Nope. And, of course, the monster doesn't set off the mine, and it's off to running away some more. Don't worry, the monster picks up the mine and throws it and it explodes about as big as a firecracker. Then ""hero"" is caught by the monster and thrown against a tree. Not killed, of course. A local teen throws a rock at the monster, so ""hero"" shoots another mine, causing a small explosion next to the monster. And....it's off to running away for ""hero"" again. Ugh.

The requisite female (local teen's sister) is supposedly all tough and feisty, but somehow can't hold onto, or pick back up, her gun when the monster comes after her. Sigh. Not to mention, she looks like she should be the teen's mom, not his sister. Monster steals chick, as he apparently has a crush on her. ""Hero"" and teen come to rescue her, ""hero"" calls the monster out and sets off running (what else?) with monster in pursuit so teen and female can escape with the mutant DNA canister. (Don't worry, just because it's leaking is no problem. It's in a canvas bag.) ""Hero"" finally shoots the monster a lot (torso again) and when the monster falls down ""hero"" throws his gun off to the side. Because, of course, you would let go of your weapon without being sure the threat is over. Which, surprise, surprise, it's not.

Good news, though. ""Hero"" gets to run away some more. Yay! Monster catches up with him and punches him around, but somehow doesn't manage to cut him at all with the six inch claws that killed the other soldiers. As ""hero"" tries to crawl toward a building the monster keeps picking him up and punching him and throwing him. This manages to get ""hero"" right in front of that building, and this super fast monster just leisurely follows him. This lets ""hero"" set up a bomb with a one minute timer. ""Hero"" keeps calling for the monster to come in, local teen shows up, is told to run away, monster breaks through wall instead of coming through the door. Thanks goodness he actually showed up, since ""hero"" kept calling him kind of like I call my dog to come. Monster slowly stalks ""hero"" across the room and ""hero"" crawls backward. Teen shows up, shoots the monster and helps ""hero"" get out just before the bomb goes off. Hmm.

Good riddance monster, right? Nope. They go to find the female and what!? There is the monster, holding the chick hostage, with claymores tied around a nearby tree, attached to a trigger line around monster's foot. UGH. No worries though. ""Hero"" gives a short speech about how they are both ""men of honor"" and don't kill innocents. Monster releases chick, gives a salute (yes, really) and then blows himself up.

There is the merest hint at the end that ""hero"" could be infected too, but I am sure that all he needs is a good ""men of honor"" speech and he will be fine.

The premise was good, but the way the story unfolded was just lame. I did watch it the whole way through though, so I couldn't give it a one star. But I couldn't really enjoy it either, hence the two stars. The movie took itself too seriously, but wasn't able to perform to the level that would allow the audience to take it seriously too. If they had gone for a more campy feel, it would have been much better.",1469404800,4,4550,4.4681107099879664
