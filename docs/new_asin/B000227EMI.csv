2055369,5,B000227EMI,"I am ordering The Perfect Postnatal Workout because I enjoyed The Perfect Pregnancy Workout so much! I've gotten a lot of workout videos and this one is the best. Even compared to videos for exercisers who are not pregnant, this one is the most interesting and challenging.",1096934400,9,273,4.829787234042553
2055370,5,B000227EMI,"I am now 6 1/2 months pregnant, and I just have to say that I was extremely

skeptical of ordering ANOTHER prenatal workout video after being so

disappointed with others I've purchased. However, after using this video

for just 2 1/2 weeks, I am no longer having the constant paralyzing pain of

lower back problems and sciatica. Also, I have a normally high heart rate

to begin with and this is the first exercise video/workout that I've been

able to do without it raising my heart rate too much. I am so glad that I

convinced myself to order this video!",1096934400,20,559,4.475247524752476
2055373,2,B000227EMI,Okay work out but so so so boring and out dated! I should have checked the year it was made before buying it.,1470873600,,109,3.782608695652174
2055374,5,B000227EMI,"i teach high cardio before until got heart murmur from this pregnancy and my body needs to slow down... i love doing this workout every morning as i wake up to start my day and house is still quiet since my toddler is still sleeping.... it feels like doing pilates but with combination of weights which is awesome!,,, kegels are a bonus too!! highly recomended for low impact but strength workout routine.... love it!,,",1467072000,,419,4.675675675675675
2055375,1,B000227EMI,"I only could bring myself to do this workout once. I had purchased this based on all of the good reviews it had received, and I had thought it would be like the workouts I did during my last pregnancy.  I also ordered Leah Sarago's Fit and Sleek Prenatal Physique at the same time, and I loved this one, as it was challenging and well-made.  The Perfect Pregnancy workout had a strange set up.

The beginning of the DVD lists guidelines as to how to do each of the moves that will follow...as if you are going to remember all of this later? I thought that was strange.  It was extremely low budget and cheesy, with computerized voices narrating the different levels (""Beginner""...""Advance"") as these popped up in tiny split screens, which was somewhat distracting. The moves themselves seemed disjointed, as though one did not flow to the next.  The last three minutes are devoted to circling  your arms for the three minutes, to build mental and physical endurance, but it just seemed strange to me, as you are left circling your arms for three minutes watching her circling her arms for three minutes.

For me, this was not my style at all whatsoever. Prior to becoming pregnant, I had completed the original two months of insanity and was just beginning week three of Jillian Michaels 30 Day shred.  While I thought the Perfect Pregnancy strength moves were appropriate for pregnancy (they didn't seem to contradict anything I'd heard that you shouldn't do while pregnant), they were, as I said, boring, filmed in a dark old gym (???) and included no sort of cardio at all, which to me, would necessarily need to be part of a ""perfect"" pregnancy workout.  Even though she mentioned the cardio she does outside of the DVD, that doesn't help me right now, when I'm wanting to work out, with cardio and strength, while watching the DVD.  LOL. Anyway.  It may be good for some people who just want a strength workout. Bottom line, just wasn't my style and I'm sending it back.",1465516800,,1975,4.646551724137931
2055376,2,B000227EMI,"I had high hopes for this workout. I have done insanity until about 24 weeks pregnant and wanted something not so intense. I tried this one a few times and it felt like my pubic bone was being ripped apart the next day, not a nice after workout burn. I switched back to insanity and just modify it now and i don't feel like i am being pulled apart.",1464825600,,348,4.057971014492754

2055379,1,B000227EMI,I only got one workout in this entire video i thought I was getting different exercises. I thought I was getting something like Gillian m but less intense  were I can do one different exersice per day. And feel challenge each time. This was the worst money invested.,1455580800,,266,4.541666666666667

2055383,2,B000227EMI,"This workout DVD didn't work for me because I was used to strength training and higher-impact exercise before pregnancy (I really like the Jillian Michaels DVDs, etc).  I felt that it seemed dated, and was VERY slow- IE I didn't even break a sweat.  It may work for others but I didn't really feel like I got a good workout from it.  It does give advice on best practice as far as working out while pregnant, which is good.",1453161600,,423,4.329113924050633
2055384,5,B000227EMI,"Awesome workout I've used for both of my pregnancies! This is a real work out with muscle building instead of fluffy ""pregnancy cardio"" stuff. If you are looking for something that is more and makes you feel like you've actually worked this is the DVD for you.",1451520000,,260,4.553191489361702
2055385,3,B000227EMI,Not a very good workout for pregnant moms who haven't already been working out.,1450828800,,79,4.714285714285714
2055386,4,B000227EMI,"This workout is challenging and relaxing at the same time. I really do like it and can already see a lot of changes in my triceps specifically. My only complaints with this video are that it's very fast moving and she doesn't explain each move before beginning so until you get it down you will be scrambling a bit from move to move. I also did not like that it's only one workout, I don't want to do the same thing all the time and would have preferred a few options. My last complaint is that the workout is full body meaning it targets upper and lower body. Because there are no complimentary workouts to this I find it difficult to put into my weekly workout routine because I can really only do it between two cardio days. I wish there were two separate workouts, one for upper and one for lower so I could use it more easily in conjunction with other workout programs. Otherwise I'm a big fan and think it's a great workout.",1450051200,2,930,4.2897727272727275
2055387,4,B000227EMI,"From the reviews I was expecting this to be a bit more challenging, but it is still a good workout. For a more challenging workout, I suggest the Body by Trimester DVDs if you are in good shape.",1447632000,,194,4.131578947368421
2055388,4,B000227EMI,I was sore just from one day of use. I just wish it had more workouts on it but it met my expectations for a pregnancy workout dvd.,1447372800,,131,3.7142857142857144
2055389,5,B000227EMI,"This was by far my favorite pregnancy workout DVD - and I've tried quite a few. I'd say it's set up more for those who are already in good shape at the onset of their pregnancy. If that's you expect this video will feel fairly easy in the first and second trimester. The DVD really shines in the third trimester when you really need to maintain and build strength. Many exercises includes different levels of difficulty, which is really nice if you've gone without exercising for awhile. I love how she focuses on squats and kegels in the video. I do wish the video included pelvic tilts to counteract ligament pain. Overall, it's a really good option. I couldn't imagine not having this video during my pregnancy. I can see using this same DVD for several weeks postpartum too.",1446940800,,778,4.60431654676259
2055390,4,B000227EMI,"It's a nice workout, I like that she's inclufing Keggel exercises,
I like that it's a whole body workout, including different levels (beginngers/advanced...) for few exercises.
it's simple, easy, nothing fancy.
A good change for a different workouts, but not my favorite.",1446940800,,271,5.476190476190476
2055391,1,B000227EMI,So creepy!,1445385600,,10,4.5
2055392,4,B000227EMI,"This is a pretty solid workout, and it's on the hard side on the difficulty scale compared to my other prenatal DVDs. I would say the workout concentrates a little more on the upper body than lower. I personally find this to be just enough in terms of intensity and length, and I do other DVDs like Pilates and Tracy Anderson for lower body and to balance things out. The music is a little funky, and the instructor's cue isn't perfect, but those are minor issues to me. For most of the moves there are beginner and advanced variations, and I do a mix because for a few moves, advanced isn't much harder than beginner.",1444694400,,618,4.3826086956521735
2055393,5,B000227EMI,I loved this workout except the last part. Way too receptive. I was definitely sore the day after I did this! Those dips in the beginning are killer lol. But only if you aren't already in tip top shape. It's probably too mellow for you if you're already hardcore work out person. But I enjoyed it!,1444435200,,297,4.321428571428571
2055394,4,B000227EMI,"Used this during my third pregnancy. It seemed very simple at the beginning of the pregnancy, then I stopped doing it for awhile and found it almost  impossible to pick up again because it was so much harder with my added weight.",1441670400,,229,4.4523809523809526

2055396,4,B000227EMI,Great workout dvd for expecting moms!!  This really engages your muscles and helps tone your body while giving you a boost of energy!!  It's not too strenuous but if you find yourself out of breath always be sure to just take a moment and rest.  Listen to your body and it will tell you what it needs.  Drink plenty of water while doing this workout so you don't get any cramps!!  All in all its a great way to stay in shape throughout your pregnancy!!!,1440633600,,453,4.2823529411764705
2055397,5,B000227EMI,"I tried multiple prenatal workouts and never felt challenged. This video, while long, challenges you without being overly strenuous or taxing on your heart. I used it from week 28 on.",1438128000,2,183,4.935483870967742

2055400,5,B000227EMI,"I love this pregnancy DVD. It allows you to work out at different levels depending on your comfort level during different stages during your pregnancy. I liked that I felt like I was engaging my muscles and toning up without over exerting myself. This DVD is great for women of all fitness levels. I am an active person & felt great using this program throughout my pregnancy. But even if I was not an active person, I'd still love this DVD, as it allows for a range of movements catering from beginning level to advanced. You need a pair of hand weights and a chair for a few movements, so keep that in mind. I used 3lb weights & got a good workout. I prefer this DVD over any other pregnancy DVD I have. Easy to get the hang of & I actually feel like I improved my fitness afterwards.",1432512000,,786,4.246666666666667
2055401,5,B000227EMI,"I have bought about 12 workout videos since being pregnant. I had a really difficult time finding workouts that were challenging enough since there weren't may reviews online, so here is my review. I hope you find it helpful!

Pre-pregnancy I ran around 20 miles a week, and did an addition 2-4 strength days a week. I am very active and in good shape. However, After my first two months of pregnancy I couldn't run anymore, so I started looking for ways to build muscle safely and effectively as well as find alternative cardio routines. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and can still perform all of these videos. I have seen muscle gain (as has my husband and mid-wives who compliment how well I've stayed in shape!), and I can't wait until I loose this bit of baby fat to really see the definition! The following are my favorite 4 videos that I really found challenging and effective, as well as great for times I have had more or less energy throughout pregnancy. They have really helped keep me in shape when I couldn't run or do military-like workouts anymore!

1. Fit+Sleek Prenatal Physique with Leah Sarago. Moderate/difficult. The weight portions allow you to add additional weight so you can continue to challenge yourself. Easy to mix and match and repeat sections for more reps. My favorite on this video is the upper body and ab portions. I usually do two workouts twice per per day when doing this video. The lower body is also very good. It's also a nice video for when you don't have a lot of time or energy to have the option of doing a 15-30 minute workout since each section is just 15 minutes. Has a good workout suggestion guide. Also, the pre-natal stretch is AMAZING!

2. Expecting More with Sara Haley: Moderate/Difficult. Okay, so this one I have mixed feelings. Over all, I do love it since the workouts are longer (Around an hour, depending) and they are very effective. She just kind of gets on my nerves sometimes with her silly dance moves and the tone she uses. You do have to be careful and be sure to follow moderation's if you aren't as fit--some of the jumping and twisting around can be scary if you don't know how to do it right. She is good at her instructions and making sure you and baby stay safe. Over all, some of these are very challenging, and some are easier. I love the cardio portions, though her strength portions are great, and you will want bumb-bells. Also is a fun video if you like to dance!

3. Long and Lean prenatal Workout with Suzanne Bowen: Easy/Moderate. This was one of my first prenatal videos, and still one of my favorites. I do this one on the days where I have no energy. It does a good job working shoulders and your lower body groups. In the past couple months I have added light weights (3-5lbs) to some of the arm and squat portions to challenge myself more. There is no cardio, really, but is a nice, effective Pilates style workout. My sister, who is a Marine, did this one with me some months after having her 3rd child and felt a little sore the next day. This is one that will def get easier pretty quick if you are moderately to in good shape. But it is effective enough, and more relaxing on those super sleepy, growing a baby days :)

4. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout with Karyne Steben. Moderate/Difficult. LOVE this workout! Karyne is a world class athlete and this video shows that. This chick is buff! I have been doing this video for about 6 months, and still find it a little challenging. She covers all main muscle groups, lower body, abs, back, side-body, in very safe and effective ways. I do feel most of the focus is in the upper back and arms, so you will def be feeling this the next day! You will want dumb-bells this one. This video is a bit relaxing in style, and it is a bit on the old fashion side (as far as music and quality), but it is really great and one of my favorites.

All of these videos have great stretch portions that I feel are very effective in getting baby where he/she needs to be for delivery, and really helps get your body get into optimal shape for delivery as well. Like I said, my mid-wives have complimented me on how well I have stayed in shape, and my husband has taken lots of notice, too. He thinks I have more muscle on me now than I did pre-pregnancy! I do these videos about 5 times a week and have felt healthy and good throughout my pregnancy. I hope my review helps you!",1432339200,14,4393,4.397293972939729
2055402,5,B000227EMI,"Great pregnancy workout video! I do a lot of videos at home and I'm very picky with my trainings but I have to say that this one is really good. I enjoy doing it and even though it's not that hard, it gives you a really good pregnancy workout.",1432080000,,243,3.979591836734694
2055403,5,B000227EMI,I use this DVD twice a week at least and find it to be challenging enough. The instruction is clear and the exercises do make your muscles work. I like that it is long enough so I get my much needed movement in for the day. There are variations for beginner and expert alike. I found that I started with the beginner moves and was able to get to advanced moves for most of the exercises in a matter of a month in a half. I did exercise regularly by lifting weights and doing other cardio activities so I was in good shape with a fair amount of stamina before I started. I expect to use this as much as possible throughout my pregnancy. I am still able to do the routine and I am nearing my second trimester. I recommend it.,1431043200,,723,4.098591549295775
2055404,5,B000227EMI,"My husband and I cant help but laugh at the trainer's accent but this workout is so badass, I feel like eating a well deserved plate of gnocchi after doing it.
I just wished the trainer went a little slower, especially during the floor work.",1430870400,,241,4.377777777777778
2055405,3,B000227EMI,This is a workout for real athletes. The instructor is an acrobat and so fit it is really intimidating for those of us who are at best power-walkers. I watched the intro and tried to do some moves but it was way beyond my skill level. I think this video is perfect for someone who is already really into fitness and wants to stay fit while pregnant. I got a lot more out of the prenatal yoga class I went to.,1430611200,,408,4.049382716049383
2055406,5,B000227EMI,Easy to follow muscle strengthening/sculpting workout. I really appreciate Karyne being focused on the exercises and not being annoying like so many other (prenatal) workout instructors who make you want to smash your TV. I do it once a week but will probably increase it to every other day in my third trimester as this workout is especially preparing for giving birth I feel (I am currently 25 weeks pregnant).,1429228800,,412,4.9
2055407,5,B000227EMI,"This was my go to workout during pregnancy. For me it was the right intensity. I bought the 10 min Pilates and some other yoga DVD. I thought the Pilate was too much and I often didn't feel good afterwards. It had too much core elements. The yoga one was not enough work out.

This work out is kind of fun, with uplifting music. The pace is good. I like that it gives you time to actually go grab the chair so you don't have to pause, get the chair and start again. I would highly recommend it!",1428710400,,494,4.040816326530612
2055408,5,B000227EMI,"I have used this video for 4 out of 5 of my kids, my go to video for the last 8 yrs. This workout has prevented and gotten rid of my pregnancy aches and pains. By month 7 my ligaments become so relaxed that walking is extremely painful or nearly impossible. As soon as I do this video it strengthens and stretches so I walk pain/ache free. I also am able to get into my pre-pregnancy form and weight after every kid and quickly go back to my Jillian fav (6 wk 6 pack). Also it helps your pregnancy stay all baby bump. Currently in my final month for my 5th, it is helping with my pregnancy and recovery from car accident injuries. I can't recommend this video enough; your pregnant body will yell at you if don't and love ya if you do.",1428364800,2,735,4.111111111111111
2055409,2,B000227EMI,"I didn't think this workout was that challenging but the main issue I had with it was that she didn't lead the exercise very well. For instance, she did not do a good job of showing you what exercise was next, nor did she give you enough time to transition from one exercise to the next. I found myself having to hit pause quite a bit to figure out what the next exercise was and then get in the right position. So far, my favorite prenatal workouts are the ones by Summer Sanders and Lindsay Brin. Both come with a special workout for each trimester, and I always feel like I get a decent workout from them.",1425859200,,608,4.205128205128205

2055416,5,B000227EMI,This is a great workout. It's challenging but has modifications for lower impact if you need it and it utilizes women who are late in their own pregnancies for demonstration of the workout which I found inspiring.,1420761600,,213,4.783783783783784
2055417,5,B000227EMI,"This is perfect now that I'm towards my due date.  It was a bit easy the second trimester, but I had to take it easy due to high risk pregnancy so it was perfect.  One thing is that the bulky tummy is now getting in the way, it would be nice to see more modifications on some of the moves, but really, this is a great video.  Not too hard or too easy.",1418169600,,351,3.780821917808219

2055420,5,B000227EMI,"This is the most challenging prenatal workout I own, I love it. It mostly uses your own body weight for toning, sculpting, and strengthening. At most you just need a few hand weights for just a couple of the exercises. I've been alternating this one with Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout, and I feel like the 2 do a great job at giving me a well-rounded workout routine. Summer Sanders isn't as difficult per se (I can do the whole thing without rests), but it does offer more in the way of cardio, which I really appreciate.",1414627200,,524,4.46875

2055422,5,B000227EMI,I do this workout once a week. I am average weight and do not usually workout but wanted something safe to keep active with during pregnancy. There is a basic and advanced method for each of the exercises. Nothing seems too difficult but the farther along in pregnancy I get the more I can feel it working the muscles I will need for delivery. I love her too! She isn't fake or annoying.,1412208000,,387,4.315068493150685

2055434,5,B000227EMI,"I started doing this workout when I was 14 weeks pregnant and was looking for something that would maintain my tone and elevate my heartrate. Prior to pregnancy I worked out 3-4 times per week--a combo of lifting and running, so I was moderately fit. I really like this workout a lot. There are good stretching segments at the beginning and end. She integrates kegels into the workout, which is great. The workout segment is 40ish minutes long and has both standing and floor work. There are modifications for most of her exercises so you can make them more difficult. I'm 28 weeks now and can still do the work, and she looks pretty big, so I'm pretty sure this will last me through my pregnancy. I do this a couple of times per week and alternate with Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout. This workout elevates my heart rate and has helped me maintain my tone. I like it a lot. Some reviews dogged the atmosphere of the video, but I personally like that its only her in a gym. None of those irritating aerobics lackeys smiling unnaturally in the background. If you want to do the advanced modifications, get a step and some 5 lb free weights. I would recommend this video to any pregnant lady who is trying to maintain her fitness level.",1410220800,3,1250,4.511013215859031
2055435,5,B000227EMI,"The production quality is a little dated, but the workout is solid gold. As someone who was very active before pregnancy (yoga, HIIT) I struggled to find a workout that would help maintain my fitness during pregnancy. This is definitely not as glossy as some of the newer videos but the content is solid with a variety of modifications that can be made to accommodate different fitness levels or stages of pregnancy. I use this about 3-4 times a week, in addition to walking and prenatal yoga. Very happy with this video.",1409702400,2,521,4.673913043478261
2055436,4,B000227EMI,This is a great workout before your third trimester. I only walk/waddle now. It would be nice to have modified exersizes for the 3rd trimester.,1409616000,,143,4.76

2055440,4,B000227EMI,This is a good workout video if you need to get your heart pumping. I used it in my first pregnancy because I wanted something more aggressive. And my second pregnancy I used it because I wanted to be able to sleep better and getting my heart rate up helped. I did find however that some of the floor leg exercises did too many reps on one side before switching. I would advise switching legs sooner. It triggered siatic nerve pain for me.,1407369600,,439,4.301204819277109
2055451,5,B000227EMI,I really liked this workout video it was easy to follow and had 3 levels of difficulty. She gave excellent instruction but didn't talk a lot. I will keep this and do it the next time I get pregnant.,1407110400,,198,4.102564102564102

2055454,5,B000227EMI,Love it!  You can stick with the beginner or challenge yourself to moderate or advanced.  I get a good workout and feel good when finished.  She explains everything during the workout.  Love the beginning warm up and ending warm down.,1404345600,,234,4.775
2055455,5,B000227EMI,"This workout was awesome. While it's centered around the pregnant woman, it really didn't hold much back. You will workout, you will sweat, and your legs and arms will burn. It was a great challenge for me, especially as my baby bump got bigger. An extreme athlete probably wouldn't be impressed, but my suggestion is to ramp it up with weights or just go to the gym if this isn't enough. I personally wanted to be healthy and fit, but I wanted a guide to make sure I wasn't doing anything that might be harmful, so this video was absolutely PERFECT for me.",1403136000,,557,4.41747572815534

2055458,5,B000227EMI,Love this workout! I run a lot and bought this to keep my core strong so I could continue to run through my pregnancy. I couldn't believe how sore I was after the first time! (Which is a good thing!) This had helped ease my back pain and prevent swayback from happening too!,1400284800,,274,4.188679245283019

2055460,5,B000227EMI,"I bought two DVD's that were highly recommended by the Amazon reviewers: The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1 Sculpting & Tracy Anderson, The Pregnancy Project

The Perfect Pregnancy Workout - Vol 1
Love this DVD! I was in a modern dance company before getting pregnant so I was already fit.  However, I was told to take it easy and not over do it.  So on this hiatus I really craved a pregnancy workout that wouldn't over exert me but would give me the same energy I was used to before.  I started this workout at 5 months and found which parts I could do at the beginner level and advanced level (or even combining the two to make an intermediate level).

Pros:
-Multi levels shown at the same time or alternating so you can choose on the spot what works best for you
-You can watch the instruction section before starting the workout so you know the proper form of each move
-Warm up and cool down included
-Kegel exercises are thrown in intermittently which is a huge benefit for labor prep
-Great pace; the flow between each workout is smooth without being too fast but still keeps you warmed up and moving
-Inspiring! The DVD is taught by a Cirque du Soliel trapeze artist, so seeing her very pregnant, fit, and sculpted is a great motivator

Cons: (It's hard to say what I don't like about this DVD because it works really well for me, so I'm going to try and be nit picky)
-You're not sure how pregnant she is so it's hard to tell how far into your pregnancy you can do this workout without it being too much.  So you'll have to gauge that yourself.
-Warm up is a little short but that might be a personal preference because I'm used to longer stretching periods

And that's it.  I honestly love this DVD!

Tracy Anderson: The Pregnancy Project
Perfect for all levels! I started this DVD at 4 1/2 months and loved it.  Tracy is great at motivating and keeping you focused. The level of difficulty IMO is between beginner and intermediate.  And because of that you still get a good workout without over exerting yourself. I would say that this DVD is designed more for anyone who wants to workout, whether you were fit or not before pregnancy.

Pros:
-A special workout for each month of your pregnancy.  MAJOR plus.  Since you experience something different with each trimester this helps so much in keeping you fit during each stage.
-Each month comes with interviews from people who have used Tracy's workout, so you get an insight into how they benefited and get some inspiration in the process.
-Warm up and cool down included
-Great pace and she talks you through everything
-You workout your whole body with easy to follow movements.  You don't know you're working out your abs until you're sore the next day :D
-You can choose to play the DVD with or without her music.  So if you don't like her music choices you can play your own and still hear the instructions

Cons:
-There isn't an instructional section that you can look at before starting the workout so you learn as you go, but it's hard to check your form while doing the workout

2055471,4,B000227EMI,"This is fun to do and doesn't get boring like some videos do. I only wish it was more intense, though I have yet to find a workout like that for a pregnant woman!",1398297600,,162,3.7941176470588234
2055472,5,B000227EMI,This DVD has changed my whole experience with pregnancy. With my first I suffered from intense sciatica from my second trimester on. I'm in the middle of my third trimester now and only notice the sciatica when it's been several days since I did the workout. My body feels so much better that I literally forget I am pregnant sometimes. This will be a must for all future pregnancies.,1397001600,,384,4.579710144927536
2055473,3,B000227EMI,Reviews and cover have you fooled into thinking this could keep you in shape. Very boring compared to what I thought it could be. Maybe it'll be more challenging when I'm bigger so far it isn't at all. But I'm used to insanity. If you hardly workout or just started for a better healthier pregnancy than go for it. But if your expecting the safer extreme for pregnant woman you might not wanna waist your $,1396483200,,406,4.355263157894737
2055474,5,B000227EMI,This was a great short workout and helped work out pregnancy pains. I am not a marathon runner and found this easy on the right days and challenging on other days as needed.,1396310400,,173,4.2727272727272725
2055475,2,B000227EMI,"I have all 3 of the perfect pregnancy workout volumes and don't like any of them in terms of their set up (showing the different levels from beginner to advanced in weird ways that distract you) and just having an overall really outdated progression.  I do continue to do the belly dancing volume though, as I feel like it actually is useful and relaxing and would come in handy during the late stages of pregnancy and even during labor.  The yoga one I didn't even make it through the first time around, I ditched it and switched to one of my other work out dvds.  I did complete this one, but I won't be adding it to my normal rotation - it's not very challenging 90% of the time, and some of the moves aren't safe (lunges where they actually ENCOURAGE you to get your knee beyond your toes??? Thats a great way to injure your joints. pregnant or not). The instructor is in amazing shape, but I question if this video is how she got there.  I am in pretty good shape, and this dvd just didn't challenge me enough.  A few of the moves felt like they may be doing something, but I know I would lose all of my tone and muscle definition if I used this video exclusively.  Check my other reviews for better prenatal work outs!",1395792000,,1224,4.2770562770562774
2055476,4,B000227EMI,A good exercise video for pregnancy. Depending on what kind of shape you were in before you got pregnant and how far along you are you made need to ease into it or not do the whole thing at once.. It's nice that it has an actual pregnant woman doing the exercises and not some tiny person telling you you should be able to do this when it's an effort to get out of a chair.,1395619200,,373,3.9210526315789473
2055477,5,B000227EMI,This was just the workout I needed. Prior to being pregnant I was going to Bootcamp 3 days a week and was totally bummed my body wouldn't let me continue after 12 weeks of pregnancy. She is a beautiful gal teaching you and even she looks a little fat pregnant so I felt right at home!,1395273600,,284,4.089285714285714
2055478,3,B000227EMI,"The overall setting, music, and voice are a little weird/creepy...definitely low budget but the overall workout is pretty good.  I highly recommend Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout & 10 Minute Solutions: Prenatal Pilates",1395100800,,220,5.875

2055480,5,B000227EMI,"Love this workout as it is simple, straightforward and incorporates all areas of your body. It was a little too easy in the beginning of my pregnancy but by the end of my second trimester the workout now seems challenging and effective. I use it at least 3x a week and turn on a tv show or movie while I am doing it. She really works your arms too! I mix this workout in with walking everyday, and the upper arms and legs series from Tony's '10 minute trainer' program.",1394496000,,469,4.222222222222222

Also, the instructions are clear and easy to follow. I really appreciate the beginner and intermediate/advanced options for each move.  Steben has mapped out a wonderful workout that targets all the major muscle groups - I can tell that I worked out the next day, but in a good way!",1394150400,,459,4.597560975609756
2055492,4,B000227EMI,"I just did this workout last night.  If can get past the cheesy 90's music and soft French voice, it's a pretty solid workout and must work since my legs and arms are a little sore!  The DVD is about 40 mins, which includes 30 mins of the actual workout and a short warm up and cool down.  Really like it!",1393459200,,305,3.9672131147540983
2055493,4,B000227EMI,"Out of the 4 DVDs I bought this was the most challenging workout and I'm glad I got it for that reason. It's pretty straight forward and maybe even a little boring but it is a stronger, harder workout than some of the other DVDs.

Definitely worth getting to mix it up. It's easy to get bored of the same workouts every day (at least for me)",1393372800,,341,4.08955223880597
2055494,5,B000227EMI,"Bought this DVD about a month ago and love it! It makes for a good workout. This workout is challenging, but not so much you feel like you're going to pass out. And there are different modifications to fit what works for you.",1392076800,,225,4.255813953488372
2055495,5,B000227EMI,"This workout is wonderful. The instructor is amazing, so strong and in such good shape while hugely pregnant! I was doing insanity when I found out I was expecting and this, even though a lot lower impact and less tiresome, was a good transition for me.",1391126400,,253,4.521739130434782
2055496,5,B000227EMI,"I truly enjoyed doing this and although my husband thinks the music and some movements are hilarious, it makes you feel good to be able to work out during pregnancy, and to do exercises meant for our pregnant bodies. I was a little sore in all the right places but not too badly. I didn't get sore like as if I had done a boot camp. Its really all about how much you push yourself, just like any other workout. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have a healthy pregnancy.",1391040000,,480,4.228260869565218
2055497,5,B000227EMI,"I think it touches all the major areas in a short period of time. My only quibble would be that it seems to use a lot of props that have to change rapid-fire (chair! step! free weights! pillows!) But once you get used to the timing, it's great. I don't think it is as hard as some of the others that I like (Suzanne Bowen Barre, and Jennifer Wolfe Vinyasa) but it is shorter and still does a great job.",1390176000,,402,4.0375
2055498,1,B000227EMI,I bought this when I was about 3 months pregnant but it was too easy. I was very active before I got pregnant so this was boring and I felt like I wasn't doing anything.,1390089600,,169,3.857142857142857
2055499,5,B000227EMI,I did this exercise program throughout my pregnancy and loved it. Even my husband worked out with me. There are 3 levels of many of the exercises so you can choose which level you want to exercise at depending on how you feel that day. All the levels are presented at once. You don't have to watch a separate movie so my husband would do the harder level while I did the easy level at the same time. I think it will be a good after pregnancy work out too.,1389225600,,455,4.066666666666666
2055500,1,B000227EMI,"tried this in the 2nd trimester.  i expected a better workout for my muscles.  i started the pregnancy with great cardiovascular health due to running, so i wanted to gain some strength...this would not work for me",1388966400,,214,4.756756756756757
2055501,5,B000227EMI,Worked out alot before pregnancy then stopped the first trimester got this in my second.  Whooo whooped my but.its easy but im outa shape now haha i have asthma..def made me work ... its nice knowing all the workout is safe for me.,1388880000,,231,4.372093023255814
2055502,4,B000227EMI,"Great whole body workout; I didn't have hand weights but found a bottle of wine or tin can of food worked well as a substitute.
The workout is well timed - just shy of 40mins. There is a section with modified ""traditional"" sit ups - not sure if that fits with current best practice thoughts for pregnancy - I'd check with your Obstetrician first!
One shortfall is that there is only one workout, which gets a little boring to do everyday. So I'm going to invest in a preg yoga dvd to do on alternate days.
I got the DVD when I was around 20 weeks; I was relatively fit prior to pregnancy & found the workout raised by heart rate enough & gave my muscles a decent workout.",1388707200,,671,4.209302325581396
2055503,5,B000227EMI,I absolutely loved this workout while pregnant!  I had so many compliments on what a fit pregnant person I was.  I was never a gym rat.

2055505,4,B000227EMI,"PROS-  you most likely already own any equipment you need--- a chair, some canned foods or light hand weights, a pillow, a little step stool
-just the right length
-since she is obviously pregnant and very healthy, I felt motivated and safe that the exercises were good for me and baby
- the squating gets your ready for labor and delivery

I am a cardio/running junkie, but pregnancy has really made me reevaluate how important sculpting is, not only to look ""good,"" but more importantly to keep me injury free.  This video is excellent, and tough (in a good way).  This lady has a crazy awesome body at like 8 months pregnant and is really inspiring.  There are 3 different levels, so good for a beginner, intermediate, or athlete!",1386979200,,439,4.8133333333333335
2055507,5,B000227EMI,"Excellent workout BUT not a workout for those who have not been exercising regularly (including push-ups, dips, squats, abs, lunges, bridge). The music is more soothing and tolerable then most workout videos, and if you don't want to listen to it, then turn it off (after a week you can follow along without verbal instruction), and play your favorite tunes. For whoever on here said her accent can get annoying, clearly you need to travel/ be cultured lol, it's really not a big deal.
Its about 42 minutes long, there is no fluff between exercises that take up time, and modifications are offered for beginners, intermediates, and advanced exercisers. You can increase weights or reduce as needs, of course.
I highly recommend this workout, but it all depends on your level of activity prior to pregnancy. I see it as almost a 'mini p90x'!",1386460800,,840,4.840277777777778

2055509,4,B000227EMI,I used this while pregnant with my (now) 1 year old daughter. I only used it for a few months but I found it to be helpful in helping me know what to do and stretch.

I started doing this early in my pregnancy (first trimester), but had to stop because my morning sickness got real bad.

It has a workout for beginners who want to take it a little easier or women who want to push themselves a little harder.",1383868800,,482,4.274725274725275
2055514,2,B000227EMI,"I will continue to use this but I was honestly quite disappointed that a woman who looks so fit on the video is doing such an easy workout. the workout is about 40 minutes long and there were only about 10-15 minutes during the center where I was sweating at all... I am now 6+ months pregnant and still doing kettlebell workouts as well and will have to keep doing those at this point because while it's nice to see her take on safe pregnancy moves, this just isn't going to cut it.",1383264000,,483,4.204301075268817
2055515,1,B000227EMI,"I got this DVD for my wife when she was pregnant. She did it a few times, but said it was too weird to work out to. I watched a few minutes of one and all I can say is WTF? They have a voice over telling you what to do, while this nervous looking pregnant lady does the exercises. We returned it pretty quick. I guess this would work for some people, but for her, it looked like it was shot in someones home. Poor quality.",1383004800,2,422,3.8620689655172415

Whether it was Buns or Abs of Steel series or a famous Brazilian butt workout, nothing would draw me to want to continue exercising. This workout DVD however is a totally different situation. I am sort of inspired by how Karyne looks and moves (by the way, I never even knew who she was until recently I decided to look her up). Makes me want to be just as fit when I am as far due as she was in the video- by the way, it is cool to see ""a very pregnant"" woman do exercises. There are various levels that can be picked and she pretty much covers all necessary and major muscle groups too. Overall, I definitely recommend, and don't skip on ""keep up 3 min exercise"". It really is weirdly energizing.",1381363200,,857,4.168674698795181

I am healthy and active and love doing this DVD every other day. It is a great workout. It has beginner and advanced moves. I am only 18 weeks along but I feel that I will be able to do this the entire pregnancy. My four year-old and two year-old enjoy trying to do this with me. It also is great during nap time, warm up thru cool down is right at 40 minutes. If you are trying to maintain your health and fitness routine while pregnant but finding it difficult due to little ones then BUY THIS DVD. I am also looking into a Belly Dance DVD that has a strong yoga component as well to add to my prenatal exercise routine.",1381104000,,758,4.026490066225166
2055518,5,B000227EMI,This is a good workout.  I think even the fitness nuts will enjoy it as she shows you each exercise at 3 levels of difficulty.  Great for days when you have a lot of energy or very little. I like that Kegels are added to the workout because I haven't been good about remembering to do them and this is a good reminder.,1380672000,,318,4.031746031746032
2055519,5,B000227EMI,"I tried this workout for the first time yesterday and I'm pretty sore.  I am not a beginner, by any stretch, but found myself needing to stick with the beginner and intermediate modifications - and yes, I was STILL sore! The modifications are very clear, as 3 separate windows appear where she is demonstrating each simultaneously. Its nice because she doesn't have to stop the workout to show each modification and you can try a different one, easily if need be.  She does some ballet type leg-work, squats, kegels, ab-work, and some different types of push-ups that target other muscle groups.

I have to be in shape for my sisters wedding, 2mo PP and I can tell, after one go-around, that if I keep with this workout, I'm going to bounce back beautifully.  I'm so pleased with this DVD - I just wish I wasn't so sore, so I can do it again soon.",1379980800,2,847,4.48051948051948

I'm 5mos pregnant with my first bambino and was getting irritable with my limited pre-natal workout options on my island of residence. I love pushing my body running marathons, going to Bikram Yoga, doing p90, TurboFire and Jillian Michaels w/o's so you can imagine my stamina and endurance. This dvd is just 45min long and easy to follow with beginner, intermediate and advanced mod options. It feels safe, not once did I feel uncomfortable, and it's challenging enough to make you break a sweat and feel a burrrn. There's also kegels exercises which is great cuz b4 this dvd I was unmotivated to do it. The background music adds a  nice touch to keep you engaged. I just noticed there's a TPPW vol. 2 pre-natal Yoga w/o and a belly dance dvd as well which I think will be fun to try. This dvd is well worth the purchase and I highly recommend it.",1379376000,2,898,4.442424242424242
2055522,5,B000227EMI,"Really like this video as a pre-natal workout option. I was working out regularly pre-pregnancy, took it very easy the first trimester, went back to regular yoga in second trimester, but after reaching my third trimester wanted something which felt safe, that I could do at home at my own convenience and also still felt sufficiently challenging and strength building. (VS just focusing on deep breathing and gentle stretches).
The instructor is great - I was intrigued by her being a cirque du soleil gymnast but the DVD is not intimidating at all (though she is clearly very flexible!) Her instructions were clear, easy to follow, and gives different options for each exercise depending on your fitness and comfort level. I started this DVD at the start of my third trimester and was able to do all the easy options easily and also most of the difficult options. You can even break a little sweat!
It is a really good full-body, well rounded workout as it works arms, shoulders, legs, and also KEGELS! I am a little unsure about some of the ab work even though it is supported, but I would recommend going with how your body feels. Really liked the last exercise at the end which works your arms and also mentally :-)
This is probably better for somoene who has a reasonable level of fitness pre-pregnancy and enjoys being challenged.
There is a separate section that guides you through things to look out for and goes into more details in terms of form. It would have been nice to have another option for perhaps a slightly shorter sequence though.
I combined this with Jennifer Wolfe's prenatal vinyasa yoga flow and felt they complemented each other well:

2055523,2,B000227EMI,"I bought several pregnancy workout videos, and thought it would be a good idea to write a review of all of them at once: Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy; 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates; Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga; Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1; Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout.  Let me start this by saying that before my pregnancy, my level of fitness was somewhere in between couch potato and world-class athlete  I usually worked out a few times a week, doing 20-30 minutes cardio and some light weight-lifting, but was not running marathons or anything like that.  I wanted to maintain a similar level of fitness during my pregnancy, while building muscles and flexibility specific to labor and burning enough calories to offset my very increased appetite.  Whether you get one of these or not, my overall advice is that working out during pregnancy really, really helps  it helped me stay more comfortable as I expanded and my center of gravity shifted, it helped me feel good about the changes that were happening to my body, and it helped prepare me for a relatively smooth and manageable labor and delivery (no medication).

Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: This was one of my favorites, and I think in the long run it really helped prepare my body for labor; it also helped me to relax, stretch, and feel good as I got bigger and bigger.  Some of the reviews here point out that it is not a very intense workout  thats true, but I felt like there was plenty of stretching and strengthening, and through much of my pregnancy high intensity was not what I was looking for  the goal of this video is not to increase athleticism, but to help the body adjust to pregnancy and prepare for labor.  Amira is a very encouraging coach, and much of the commentary is designed to be relaxing, informative, and comforting; I also appreciated that she looked like a real pregnant woman in the video, rather than a super fit, still skinny woman who just happened to have a bump.  The bonus material  interviews and some dance performances  was not all that appealing to me, but I liked Amiras intro statement about her own experience and the history of bellydance.  The interviews might be more interesting/helpful for someone who doesnt have sisters/girlfriends who have been through this before.

10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates: This was another favorite.  I really like the format, where you can choose how many of the 10-minute segments to do, and in what order, and I felt like the workouts were manageable and well-suited to pregnant bodies.  Towards the end of my pregnancy, I was doing the flexibility workout more than the others and often just one or two at a time, but for the first two trimesters, I would usually do three of the workouts at a time.  I was somewhat familiar with pilates already, but not an expert by any means, and I found the workouts easy to follow (with a little practice needed the first few times); I think this would be good for those new to pilates, and the format means that even people who are not used to working out can start off with a manageable amount and work up from there.  The instructor sometimes gives conflicting cues about breathing patterns, but generally she is clear, informative, and easy to follow.  Seeing someone well into her 3rd trimester doing these exercises was very inspiring.  Some of the workouts don't require any equipment, but some require light hand weights and/or pillows.

Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga: I didn't get this until near the end of my pregnancy, but the few times I did it made me wish I had it earlier.  The pace and level of difficulty are definitely geared towards beginners, and much of the emphasis is on toning and stretching in ways that are particularly geared towards pregnancy and labor (kegel exercises and hip stretches).  This is a very relaxing and slow-paced video  not a killer workout that will leave you sweating and panting.  There are modifications for each trimester, but with many of the moves, I found I could do the 1st trimester version and didn't need the modifications.  It did require some equipment: a yoga blanket (? Not sure what this is  I just used a regular blanket folded up), a strap (I used the belt from a bathrobe), and a yoga brick (this was needed for some of the later trimester modifications  I just skipped it).

Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1: I had read great reviews of this, but was disappointed and only used it a few times.  Basically, it was too strenuous for my pregnant self  the instructor is a world-class athlete and I guess this is the workout she had put together for herself during her pregnancy  nothing wrong with that, but her level of fitness and her fitness goals were just a little different from mine, and I really couldn't keep up.  That said, there were a few moves that I liked and did separately when I just needed something quick (like the labor squats).  I did like it that kegels were built into this.  If you feel you are up to it, it is an intense and thorough workout.  The final section, on preparing yourself mentally by doing an intense endurance exercise, seemed silly to me at the time, and it still seems silly now that Ive been through labor: 3 minutes of arm circles is difficult, but conquering this difficulty will not be enough to prepare you for making it through labor (which can be manageable if you are well-prepared!).

Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout: This video was ok, and definitely offers a thorough workout, but it was not my favorite.  It has three separate workouts, one for each trimester, and you can choose the complete version or an express version for each one (I think the complete version is just the express workout repeated a second time)  I almost always did the express version.  The 1st trimester workout was way too hard for me (I wanted to spend most of my 1st trimester sleeping), the 2nd trimester workout was just about right in terms of intensity, and the 3rd trimester workout was a little too light (for me).  The moves here are fairly traditional and will certainly tone major muscles groups without any frills; I would have appreciated more stretching.  There were a few pregnancy-specific moves that I often did separately (labor lunges, plie squats).  Summer Sanders and her trainer/sister-in-law are encouraging, but their chatter doesnt hold up well and starts to get annoying after watching it a few times.",1378080000,3,6440,4.737219730941704

You go through a nice warm-up and then a really great workout that really got me sweating and breathing hard BUT wasn't overly hard and if I found something to be too difficult I would fall back and do the beginner version. Nice clam cool down. Overall I really enjoyed this workout.
Just remember while you are pregnant you are working out to maintain. This video was a full body workout and not very time consuming. Very happy with this purchase and will continue to do this throughout my pregnancy and then give an update when I am further along as well as after I give birth. Right now I am 6 months along!",1377043200,,727,4.6

I am 25 weeks pregnant and I started doing this workout a few times a week when I was probably 22 weeks pregnant.  When I got it, I was pretty unimpressed with the cover of the video(simple wordart with a black background) and the intro of the workout is pretty weird. BUT...I was SO impressed by this workout and the woman doing it is LEGIT.  She is a Circe de Solei acrobat who is probably 7 months pregnant while she instructs this workout(and sporting little shorts and a sports bra-work it!).  The workout takes about an hour and I feel awesome and challenged after I complete it. There are modifications to the workouts if you consider yourself advanced and the video gives you a FULL-BODY workout.  Also, to finish off your workout you have to do little armcircles for almost 4 minutes...you feel like you could die but feel awesome after not giving up...I assume that's awesome practice for contractions :)  Anyways, super recommend this for those that want a safe and challenging workout while you are preggo for you and baby :)",1375920000,,1189,4.6650717703349285

2055531,5,B000227EMI,"When I first tried out this DVD, I was disappointed with how ""easy"" it was. About 15 minutes in, I was eating my words! I've been doing this workout for a couple of months now, and I really enjoy it. It's a wonderful feeling to really be challenged and feel powerful after a day of everyone treating you like a hopeless ol' pregnant lady! The workouts are tough and just keep getting tougher as I progress through my pregnancy, but it's easy to go back and forth between the beginner and advanced moves. The music isn't bad, and the instruction is great. I suggest spending the time to watch the instructional intro to make sure you don't hurt yourself. After this workout, I'm completely spent. Also, don't expect this workout to make you look like the instructor - I still have accumulated some lovely cellulite and back fat. But my blood pressure is awesome, I feel great, and I look better in maternity clothes than I did in my last pregnancy when I wasn't really working out.

I use this DVD in conjunction with the Perfect Pregnancy Yoga (DVD 2) and time on the recumbent bike and rowing machine.",1375747200,,1102,4.5376884422110555
2055532,5,B000227EMI,"I wish I hadn't waited until now (8mos) to break out this video, it was great.  It's 45 minutes and it went by fast.  The warm up is wonderful- not just a token warm up, it really had some good stretches and I felt better almost immediately.  The workout isn't super intense cardio or boring aerobics, just simple and effective exercises.  Great for when you feel like your muscles have been atrophying and you need to work them without killing yourself.  I usually consider myself intermediate or advanced when it comes to working out, but the beginner forms of the exercises were challenging enough for me in this case.  Karen is softspoken and doesn't annoy you with stupid chatter.  She is clear and concise.

My only criticism is that the dvd cover did not make it clear what you need, but it's no big deal.  Light hand weights are optional.  You will need a chair, a step or stool, and some pillows.",1375315200,,905,4.530864197530864

2055536,5,B000227EMI,"I like to work out, and I wanted to find an at home solution that was challenging and at the same time taught by someone who understood what pregnancy was all about and all of the physical aspects of the pregnant body. This video is great, the sisters have a complete understanding of the body, how pregnancy effects specific physical aspects of our bodies, like the ligaments and joints, muscles in the abdomen, stress on the back, etc. The exercises are not just focused on breathing and stretching, but strengthening and toning, and relaxation.

In addition to the different exercises than most prenatal workout videos, one of the most unique parts of this video is that the instructor shows beginner, intermediate and advanced techniques for most of the exercises. So depending on how you feel that day, if you work out in the morning when you have more energy or when you work out in the evening and are more tired, you can choose how hard to work out but still do a complete workout.

It is a toning and strengthening exercise that takes 45 minutes, but covers everything from labor squats to tricep dips to kegels. I really like it. Karyne offers a variety of exercise levels for some of the exercises from beginner to intermediate to advance. The intermediate and advance will do variations of the exercises using a step or hand-weights. I started out with the intermediate, thinking I am pretty active, but quickly had to go to beginner. That actually made me happy knowing that while the exercises were difficult and frustration (they are actually simple moves), they are challenging and I can grow with the DVD for the remaining 22 weeks of pregnancy.

The production quality is not high end, it is simply her in a gymnastic studio completing the exercises. However I feel like the camera shows how she is doing the movements and her verbal descriptions are clear, which is what I prefer over elaborate designs and camerawork. My only ""criticism"" is that in the DVD menu the description of the movements is after the Play Workout tab. For the first time I made the mistake of just hitting play and went right into the workout and got lost and flustered with some of the moves, but when I actually went through the movement instructions first the second workout went a lot better.",1366416000,,1565,4.75

It is long enough to feel like I've had a chance to get my heart rate up a bit, and varied enough to keep my interest.  On most exercises it show 2-3 levels of difficulty, and even though I was able to do advanced on most, on a few I had to step it down a notch.  To me that shows quality, where I have to work to get to another level.  For those who are new to exercise, she shows excellent beginner options, and I would imagine you can even do less reps than she does if it's still too hard.

Sadly, I did not even break out a sweat.  To be fair, I only did the beginner modifications this time around... next time, I'll do the advanced, and up my free weights.  I'll probably keep this in my rotation for a while and give it a chance, using it for days that I want to take it easy.  I'll modify my existing videos in the interim to make them low impact... Maybe I'll appreciate 'Perfect Pregnancy' more in the third trimester...

I was going to give it two stars, but I up-ed it one point for the Kegel exercises and her soothing voice.

(Note: Before my pregnancy, I was a dedicated exerciser, working out five times a week to Cathe/Jillian Michaels 50 min - 1 hour workouts.  The first trimester slowed me down considerably, and I could only consistently work out 2-3 times a week, maybe 30 mins at a time.  I have weakened quite a bit in the last three months, but this was too easy.  Even the three minute arm circles at the end was no big deal.)",1361145600,,1101,4.326829268292683
2055561,2,B000227EMI,I placed it into the dvd and after 1 minute stopped it. There is no real structure... you are exercising right off the gate with no stretching. This is not for me... but then again look at what she does for a living. If you want to pay for the shipping for what I got I will send it to you.,1360281600,,290,3.7704918032786887
2055562,4,B000227EMI,"I found this workout was hard enough for me - I am currently 15 weeks and was a regular exerciser before falling pregnant. There is plenty of variety and beginner/intermediate options throughout. I was a bit worried taking a class from a cirque du soleil trapeze artist (!), but with the different options available, I was comfortable through the whole workout.",1359849600,,361,4.934426229508197
2055563,5,B000227EMI,"I'm currently 4 1/2 months pregnant with my 5th child. I have always been slider but in recent years I've put on a good 10 lbs. Now pregnant I'm a bit concerned about putting on too much weight. After reading all the reviews I decided on this dvd. I'm not in shape and don't workout on a regular basis. But I was able to comfortably finish the workout on the dvd without being completely exhausted. Most of the exercise  focuses on your legs, buttock and arms with a few kegels and side crunches here and there. The positions are comfortable enough that you don't feel like you are straining or hurting your baby. This is my second day working out and I totally feel the burn and plan on continuing to hopefully tone up a bit.",1359590400,3,726,4.338235294117647

2055565,1,B000227EMI,I may just be being judgemental because I am pregnant. But this is not what I was expecting. To be honest after 10 minutes I turned it off. The video looks like it is from the '80s and the music is awful!,1359244800,,204,3.880952380952381
2055566,5,B000227EMI,"When I found out I was pregnant I was doing the Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 5-6 times a week, plus jogging 6-7 miles a day.  I knew I wasn't going to keep that going.  I started researching and found this DVD to try.  I would say till about 20 weeks it was too easy for me, but I still felt better doing something.  Toward the final couple months it started feeling like more of a workout.  I did it 5-6 times a week and walked my 6-7 miles a day.  I think this is great for anyone who just wanted to keep a little muscle tone during their pregnancy to help bounce back faster after the baby is born.  Lots of alternate choices to make it easier or harder and you can pick any weight that you want.  Also there is a little mix of yoga in here too which is great for hip opening (very important for pregnant women).  Yes the background is boring to look at- but honestly I just have the DVD on on my laptop and watch something else on TV anyways so it really doesn't bother me.",1359158400,3,978,4.025906735751295
2055567,5,B000227EMI,"This is my first pregnancy and I wanted a workout that was effective, but still safe to do.  This dvd is great.  It is just the right intensity.  You work all of your muscle groups without ever feeling like you are over exerting yourself.  I was definitely sore after the first few times I completed the whole workout.  The instructor is easy to follow.  There are modifications for each exercise for beginner or advanced depending on your level of ability or your energy level for the day.",1359072000,2,490,4.574712643678161

2055569,5,B000227EMI,"I was working out regularly before becoming pregnant (this is my 4th pregnancy), but the first trimester morning sickness kept me from doing anything (I just threw up all the time and laid on the couch or in bed). Once I started feeling better and was eating enough again to have energy, I was ready to challenge my muscles and strengthen my body. I could tell I was really weak and I was gaining more weight at that point in my pregnancy than in my others. I bought this DVD and it has been a lifesaver! It stretches and relaxes the parts of my 22-week-pregnant body that just need a little extra attention. It works my muscles that have been unused for too long and it's helping curb the too-quick weight gain I was worried about. I like that she incorporates kegels into the workout and I think I will be the strongest post-pregnancy that I've ever been if I keep with this workout. You can push yourself as much as you like with the different levels, and even pause the DVD and add a few more sets if you eventually feel it's not enough. It's nothing fancy--just a woman in a gym (not even a nice-looking backdrop) with kind of funky music, but she's mellow and much better than some really peppy aerobics instructor. I'm really glad I found this workout. I tried some other pregnancy yoga videos and they were so easy and did nothing--even with my weakened muscles. This will tone you and help you with those aches and pains of pregnancy.",1357862400,6,1443,4.449056603773585
2055570,5,B000227EMI,Karyne has a accent but that adds to the DVD. Her work out is very safe for pregnancy. No jumping and she uses props for balance. But don't be fooled. By the end you are sweating and sore. I would recommend this to anyone.,1357862400,,222,4.068181818181818
2055571,4,B000227EMI,"It is nice and not boring; I like it, but it is a little too easy for me.
If you have always been actively working out (weight lifting regularly) before your pregnancy, this would be very easy for you. I'm now almost 6 months prego; I work out with the ""regular"" Muscle Max and Get Ripped DVDs 4 days a week, and this one is only used once a week.",1357862400,,347,3.9714285714285715

2055573,1,B000227EMI,i was not impressed to slow . I didn't feel like I worked out after the video was completed. I'm back to doing my prepregnancy workout videos. Hopefully what to expect when your expecting workout video is better.,1357689600,,212,4.605263157894737
2055574,5,B000227EMI,"I purchased this DVD around my ninth week of pregnancy. I have always been an active and fit person, but after the birth of my first child, I let things slide. A lot. I was worried that getting back into a regular workout routine would be tough and discouraging after such a lapse, but so important. This workout is not so intense that you get discouraged during the workoutor the next day when you face doing it again. BUT... boy can I tell that I've done an effective toning/sculpting workout 24-48 hours later! It mixes ballet and yoga with strengthening exercises and finishes with a relaxing cool down. I do this workout at night (after putting my toddler to bed), and by the end I'm loose and relaxed and mentally cleared for a good night's rest. Having been through labor once, I can attest that this workout focuses on the exact muscle groups to get you ready for the best experience you can have. Variations for beginner, intermediate and advanced make it a good choice for anyone. And many of the exercises rely on your own body weightso it naturally increases the intensity as you stick with it!",1357516800,,1106,4.590909090909091
2055575,3,B000227EMI,"I thought this workout video was ok. It wasn't one that I wanted to do again after, though. I probably wouldn't buy it again.",1357257600,,125,4.25
2055576,4,B000227EMI,"After reading the reviews, I decided it would be a good idea to get this workout and start while I was at the end of my first trimester as many have warned you do not want to wait to start this workout. Well, I guess I was pretty fit before getting pregnant, and did not find this workout to be very challenging. It's very different from any other workouts that I've done, and once you get past the strange music, and the instructor, the moves are pretty good for getting different parts of your body in shape, or keeping them in shape during your pregnancy.

Make sure that you definitely do have everything in the room with you when you start the workout - straight back chair, weights (optional), large pillows, and a step stool (also optional). I was very happy that she was doing dips with the chair as I had just decided that one of my next goals was to be able to do dips on my husbands pull up station.

I gave this four stars because it really is a decent workout to keep your muscles in shape and keep you active without overdoing it while pregnant. I have this in the rotation with my kettlebell workouts for the days that I don't have as much energy as it's not very draining. I would recommend this to women that would like to have a healthy pregnancy and were not super active prior to getting pregnant, or like me, just something easier to throw in the mix.",1356998400,,1372,4.293436293436294
2055577,2,B000227EMI,"Get the Pilates workout for pregnancy instead.  This is weird, to hard, and non- motivational.  There are lots off others to consider.  Maybe look at a snippet on YouTube first and then buy. I like shiva Rae",1356480000,2,207,4.54054054054054
2055578,5,B000227EMI,"I did this workout for my 1st pregnancy 6 years ago. It paid off. I had a great birth and short labor. I was able to get back into shape quicker. I started competing 2 years after giving birth in figure bodybuilding shows. I always look back and tell my friends how working out is so important during pregnancy. I think you will benefit from any prenatal fitness routine, but what I liked about this one and the reason why I am reordering for my second pregnancy, is I loved her workouts and the music. I was always motivated to do her workouts. I liked the screens that gave you the option to do the advance or beginner version at the same time. I am 8 weeks pregnant and looking forward to doing this workout again.",1356480000,3,717,4.279411764705882
2055579,5,B000227EMI,"This workout is long--about 43 minutes.  I didn't realize how long it was when I started, and I was soooo tired at the end.  But I really like it and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to combine this workout with cardio exercises on off days.  My favorite part about this workout is that it is so calm.  I felt very relaxed the whole time (except when I felt like I was going to die!).  She has just the right comments to keep you going when you feel like giving up.  It pairs nicely with Sara Haley's Daily Sweat workouts.",1355961600,,533,4.176470588235294
2055580,5,B000227EMI,"I was expecting something low-key and easy.  This gets my heart going and the squats really kick my butt.  I really enjoy this video and think it is well worth the investment.

2055581,4,B000227EMI,This was a great workout! I would recommend! I am a first time mom and I have had a great pregnancy - I wanted this to continue to stay in shape for the big day!,1355097600,,161,3.6285714285714286
2055582,4,B000227EMI,"I must say that I like, but not love, this DVD. It is a good total body workout that focuses on sculpting arms, buns, abdomen and legs. It actually does get my heart rate going, so while it is not technically a cardio workout, I feel I do get some benefit in this regard from this DVD. Slight weaknesses of this DVD are the quality of the production- the backdrop to the workout is somewhat lame and not very motivating. Exercises are not explained in detail during the actual workout but there is a separate segment on the DVD that explains the exercises and what to watch out for. Of course, having to watch an entire segment about the exercises takes additional time commitment. The other weakness is that it is only one workout of 40 min- no variations or options to do shorter workouts. 40 min is many a morning just about 10 min too long, which is why I end up exercising with this DVD about once per week. That being said, after the workout I usually feel great. A strong suit of this DVD is that she demonstrates variations of every exercise for beginners and advanced. So for those that are looking for a good overall sculpting workout that is definitely challenging and have 40 min time, this is a good option.

UPDATE: At 36 weeks pregnant, I have to upgrade this review to a 4 instead of a 3 star assessment. This is the only video in which I am still comfortable doing ALL the exercises; some of the other DVDs I have suggest exercises that I don't feel safe doing at this stage. When I don't have the full 40 minutes, I just skip through the video to the sections that I want to do that day. Overall, this is probably the pregnancy workout video that is most helpful in the late stages of pregnancy.",1355011200,2,1713,4.353125
2055583,4,B000227EMI,"I would have given it 5 stars, except the music and/or intro are very bland. But overall its very direct, straightforward. I felt sore the very next day and that kept me motivated to keep using the work out. It offers beginner, intermediate and advanced settings - to increase level of effort when you are ready. The pace is perfect and does not assume we are all international superstar gymnasts. I wish I had this one for my last 2 pregnancies!",1355011200,,446,4.518518518518518
2055584,5,B000227EMI,"I was a bit intimidated at first but I'm glad I bought this! I'm in my third trimester and have been using this video since my first trimester.  I alternate elliptical and yoga with this video.  It's very clearly organized with beg, interm, and advanced instructions so you always know your options.  Great buy!

2055585,4,B000227EMI,"I started doing this video at around 14 weeks, when I noticed I was gaining weight WAY too fast.  Even though I used to run 3 miles 3-4 times a week, I completely stopped in pregnancy out of fear.  It's amazing how fast your body deconditions.  The video has beginner, intermediate, and advanced options which helped me set goals for my ""rehab.""  Yes, the background is boring, the music is weird, and the woman's voice is a bit odd, but the exercises are solid without being overwhelming.  It also helped with my flexibility, and I noticed my back and leg pain were almost non-existent on days I did the video.",1354752000,2,611,4.5181818181818185
2055586,5,B000227EMI,"I love this pregnancy workout DVD.  I purchased it when I was about 14 weeks along and have been using it for approximately 10 weeks, now.  This is NOT a fancy DVD and the transitions are definitely dated looking, but the actual workout is good.  I was in the best shape of my life before becoming pregnant from using weights and cardio and I appreciate that this DVD lets me continue that mix.  It also offers beginner, intermediate and advanced examples of each workout.  My only wish is that it were a little more intense/shorter so that I had more time to do it before work in the mornings.  As it stands, this is my go-to weekend workout.",1354579200,2,643,4.406779661016949
2055587,5,B000227EMI,I consider myself pretty Athletic and this video kicked my butt! It's challenging but I am always able to finish it. The pace is perfect for mommy and baby. I was never out of breath...maybe just a little muscle fatigue! I love the warm up and cool down the most. It energizes my day and keeps me healthy. Def a must have if you are pregnant. I am only 13 weeks and this was challenging but like I said... Worth it and I finished strong. Buy it!,1354320000,,445,4.126436781609195
2055588,3,B000227EMI,I only did this video once at 28 weeks.  It was much too advance to start that far into my pregnancy.  I preferred Prenatal Yoga.,1354233600,,129,4.12
2055589,3,B000227EMI,"Overall, I expected more when I purchased this workout video.

Pros:
Good music
Beginner,  Intermediate, and advanced workouts all in one session
Good single workout routine
They had a section that showed you how to do certain moves before actually getting into workout so that there is no time wasted teaching during your workout

Cons:
I thought that there where other workouts on the dvd but it just advertises their other videos
Not very engaging, very dull host
No cardio warm-up: Make sure you do a cardio warm-up on your own, because this one doesn't have it. From what I understand you are supposed to get your body moving and warmed up before stretching and this just goes right into the stretch. She does mention going for a swim for her cardio and some other things.

If you want a relaxed workout that isn't all exciting or too long then this is for you. If your looking for a workout to get your blood flowing I suggest looking else where. I workout on a regular basis and I didn't find the advanced mode too challenging at all at 28 weeks pregnant.",1354060800,2,1062,4.544502617801047
2055590,5,B000227EMI,Its challenging but good and safe prenatal workout. All the exercise moves has a beginner intermediate and advanced level so you can pick and choose what level per move throughout the workout.,1353888000,,192,5.03125
2055591,5,B000227EMI,"This is the best prenatal workout. It's challenging enough to keep even fit women in shape throughout pregnancy. I learned some great ab workouts as well. I use this video to work out at home and I also go to the gym. I love it because you don't need a lot of equipment, just some weights. I highly recommend it.",1353801600,,312,4.216666666666667
2055592,5,B000227EMI,"I feel really good after doing this video. I just started doing it, but I feel like it makes me stronger in all the areas I'll need to get back into shape and to deliver my baby easily.

I made the mistake of only starting doing this video in my fifth month, thinking I needed to be in an advanced pregnancy state (and have a big ol' tummy) to need this particular DVD. Before doing this DVD I started having back pain that was only made worse by other DVD's that are not specifically for pregnancy.  My advice for pregnant women is: Start doing this video asap so that you build strength. I suggest avoiding other DVD's, because you're more prone to the pain you normally have when you're not pregnant. And if that pain happens to be back pain (like mine is), it will only get worse by doing something that's not completely safe. That's just my opinion as someone who's gone through the process, not a medical opinion.

The video is fun, the time passes by quickly, and it's pretty relaxing. Once you figure out the steps you can even mute it and listen to NPR or music. A nice way to spend 40 minutes of your day. It will be worth it when the baby comes (and probably after, too). Enjoy!",1353542400,,1189,4.299107142857143
2055593,5,B000227EMI,"I received my three workout videos last week: ""10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates"" with Lizbeth Garcia, ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1"" with Karyne Steben, and ""Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout."" So far I have only used 10 Minute Solution twice, and the other two only once. I would like to update as I continue to use these videos but I wanted to give my thoughts so far.

10 Minute Solution has five 10-minute workouts. I am a total newbie on pilates but I loved this video. I only made it through two workouts on my first try; on my second try I got through all five. In the future I will only use the first four, and instead of the flexibility one I will do my own stretches, just because it didn't seem to go as well with my joint pain as my own stretches do.

Perfect Pregnancy vol. 1 is about 40 minutes long. Karyne gives alternate moves for intermediate and advanced, but I had to stick with the beginner moves, and it kicked my butt. Twice I even had to stop and rest because I could not keep up with her. That woman is amazingly strong. I really liked that she included a lot of ab work, because I feel like my abs need that desperately.

Summer Sanders' workout was much milder, but it was still a good workout. She does a little bit of abs, but mostly focuses on arms and legs. The workout is about 45-50 minutes long. I didn't realize that you need a resistance band. I have one, but mine is a loop and on the video she uses a straight band with handles at each end. I was able to do the leg exercises, just holding my band lower, but for the arm exercises I used a pair of 3 lb weights instead, and that worked fine.

I just wanted to say how amazed I was with the difference I felt in my own body after only one week of working out with these videos. I am 33 years old and 21 weeks along in my 5th pregnancy. I am six feet tall, so my ideal weight is between 150-160 lbs. I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which started in my first pregnancy, which just means that I get a lot of joint pain in the back of my right hip. This joint pain got worse with each pregnancy, until in my 3rd pregnancy I was sometimes unable to walk from one room to the next without pain. I have found that regular chiropractic appointments have helped a ton, and I walked regularly through my 4th pregnancy and that seemed to help too. But I have also noticed that my abs seem really weak, like they can't handle carrying another baby and I have felt like I really need a good ab workout.

After my first pregnancy, I got down to 145 lbs. Woo-hoo!
After my 2nd pregnancy, I stopped losing at around 155. After my 3rd it was 165, and after my 4th I never got lower than 173. So I have also been extremely concerned with this trend. I have gained too much weight during all of my pregnancies, and so far in this one I have already gained about as much as I think I should have gained for my whole pregnancy. So I hope that regular exercise will help me gain slower, as well as help my joint pain.

After only one week of working out with these videos, I have already felt a huge improvement! For the first time in weeks I didn't gain a pound this week #yay!#, and although I imagine I look exactly the same, I feel better, my muscles feel tighter all over, and I feel like I look better. My joint pain is very minimal, and most of the time I don't feel any pain at all there. I am blown away with how much the joint pain has improved with just one week of working out. And my tummy feels tighter, like maybe it can handle this baby after all! I feel healthier in every way. I am really excited about such amazing results in so little time.

UPDATE 2/2013: I am now 33 weeks along. I have been favoring 10 Minute Solution, Perfect Pregnancy, and Knocked-Up Fitness with Erica Ziel, which I got a few weeks later. Over the Christmas holidays, we went out of town for a while, and I didn't exercise at all during that time, and I ate a lot more than I needed to, so at this point I am still heavier than I want to be. But I have been exercising consistently for close to a month since that break, and I am still loving these videos. I have been focusing on one video per week, which is nice to stick to something for a week but over the month I get some variety. I have been working out six days a week, and I have stopped drinking everything except water and sometimes milk, and I have been eating a lot less desserts lately. For the past few weeks my weight has pretty much stayed the same, and my back pain is very minimal. Also, I have been getting lots of compliments from my husband lately. He has noticed that my butt looks different than it has for a long time, and he says he doesn't think I have ever looked this good while being pregnant. I definitely feel better now and have more energy than I did during all of my other four pregnancies. The differences I can see are that my butt and the back of my thighs are still separate (rather than meshing together like they always did in the past), and I still have a little pouch of fat on each of my hips but it is shallower even than it was before I got pregnant, and in past pregnancies I always had a couple rolls above my belly, below my chest, and I do have one small one now but it's so much better than before. And my arms had started to get kinda floppy but now they are looking toned lately. And this is my first pregnancy without swelling in my feet and ankles. So I am still excited about my videos and hope to keep using them up until the baby comes, and then after she is born and I'm ready to exercise again, I will likely come back to these videos before going back to regular non-pregnancy videos.",1352678400,3,5670,4.153776160145587

2055595,5,B000227EMI,"This is a great strength training workout (there's no cardio, if you're looking for that) and actually feels like a workout, unlike so many other prenatal exercise dvds.  I really can't say enough about how much I like this.  The instructor is cute and not annoying at all.  She's also in great shape and very pregnant, which is good motivation!  There's a great tutorial section to help you know how to do the exercises and what ones to expect.  I don't ever feel like I'm hurting something or worried about injuries, again unlike some other prenatal workouts I've tried.  This is my second pregnancy, and I've bought/tried two other workouts on top of the one I had from my first pregnancy.  This is by far my favorite.  To give you an idea on level, I'd say this is at least intermediate.  Although, she gives modifications for beginner, intermediate, and advanced, so it's easy to adjust as needed.  I run 3-4 times a week and do yoga or strength twice a week. I do the advance or intermediate options for all the exercises.  Give this a try if you want a good, solid stength workout.",1350950400,,1088,4.556701030927835
2055596,5,B000227EMI,"I did this workout for the first time today and thought it was definitely tough.  I'm only 3 months pregnant and have spent much of my pregnancy so far exhausted, and too tired/lazy/sore to workout.  However, I was still able to do this workout in its entirety and felt great afterwards!  There's a 12 min. instructional introduction that I'd recommend watching, especially if you're new to exercising.  Each exercise includes a beginner, intermediate, and advanced version.  Buy it and thank yourself for doing so!",1350432000,,515,5.083333333333333
2055597,5,B000227EMI,"Great workout! Makes me work every time, and I feel great afterwards! I was worried that it would feel too easy since I was in pretty good pre-pregnancy shape, but this work out is awesome! It works great switching between this video, running, biking and swimming.",1350086400,,264,4.760869565217392
2055598,5,B000227EMI,"I bought this product before I even knew I was pregnant. I used it several times before I knew and after, and about 4 weeks in I started having nausea so I quit using it for a couple of weeks. Then I felt decent one night so I ploped it back into the DVD player. The next day I felt great. I barely felt any nausea, I wasn't as tired, I felt happier than I had been (moslty becuase I had felt like garbage). and I'm giving all the credit to this video. So kudos- because short of drinking a whole two liter of ginger ale everyday, I feel awesome.",1350000000,2,546,3.9727272727272727
2055599,5,B000227EMI,It's a great workout you just got to keep doing it even though you just want to lay down and sleep. Honestly it's worth your money it's not a tough workout but if you don't workout normally you will feel it in the morning,1349740800,,221,4.045454545454546
2055600,5,B000227EMI,So i just purchased this video and i absolutely love it!!! Being a military mom i need something like this to keep me toned!,1348272000,,124,4.208333333333333
2055601,4,B000227EMI,My girlfriend who is very fit recommended this video for me to try during my pregnancy. She did it throughout her entire pregnancy and is also a runner. I am not as fit however I have found that this video still works for me. The different levels for beginners and advanced helps me work on my weaknesses without feeling like I am not keeping up. Karin is quiet and encouraging and I appreciate both because this is not only my exercise time but my quiet time in the mornings before the house is up. She focuses on things like Kegals that will hopefully help me at the end of the pregnancy. This is a great video.,1348185600,,613,4.293103448275862
2055602,5,B000227EMI,"This is a great whole body workout for us pregnant gals.  My little step daughter sometime does the video with, and she thinks some of the exercises look funny (which they do) but they feel good.  Highly recommended.",1348012800,,216,4.657894736842105
2055603,5,B000227EMI,"I am a fitness fanatic & have been searching for a DVD that would provide me with some alternative exercises to do while pregnant. This is a brilliant dvd as it has 3 options (beginner, intermediate & advanced). I thought the presenter looked very toned which in turned inspired me more during the workout. It runs for 43min, once I mastered the moves I ran it like a circuit & would do it twice. Very pleased!",1347753600,,410,4.407894736842105
2055604,5,B000227EMI,"I was worried that I wouldn't be able to break a sweat from prenatal videos and that they would all be too easy. This video was great. I do the advanced moves when I feel like I have more energy and I do the beginners when I'm finding it challenging staying awake. I found this workout great... it is a little low budget to say the least, but it gets the job done, and the instructor is easy to follow and soothing - I'm really glad I bought it :)",1345420800,,447,3.977777777777778
2055605,5,B000227EMI,"I only wish I had known about this DVD sooner, so I wouldn't have wasted my time and money on others! I had previously tried a pregnancy fitness DVD that I bought at Target (by Lindsay Brin). It was just not right for me...too many dance moves and it had a very cheerleader-esque tone to the whole thing. It was sort of obnoxious to me and I dreaded working out with it. I also tried to follow a couple of routines I found online and a prenatal yoga DVD, but they were boring and I didn't feel like I was working out at all. But THIS DVD, Perfect Pregnancy Workout, is amazing. It is an actual workout. So many other DVD's or routines that I have come across that are afraid to actually make a pregnant woman work (or get results), this one, on the other hand, makes every minute count and you get a whole body workout that is both intense and safe for pregnant women and geared towards them. Karyne is calm and simply guides you through the moves, rather than acting like a perky cheerleader and talking in cutesy language. I also feel like I can really grow with this workout because it has beginner, intermediate and advanced moves and I really like the way they separately feature them....rather than 3 different people doing 3 different intensities at the same time, they cameo Karyne in 3 different windows. I really cannot say enough good things about this DVD. Don't hesitate, just go for it!",1343865600,3,1400,4.45136186770428
2055606,5,B000227EMI,"I have had this DVD for about 12 weeks (started using it about 12 weeks into my pregnancy) and I absolutely love it, and it has instructions so exercises can be modified for all stages of pregnancy and fitness levels. I did strength training consistently prior to getting pregnant, and it is great to find a DVD that motivates me to safely continue working out to stay in shape and maintain muscle tone! You need a minimal amount of props (a small step stool, a pair of 5lb hand weights and a couple of pillows) and the video gives you a whole body workout and great stretches. I would highly recommend this video.",1343779200,,614,4.442477876106195
2055607,5,B000227EMI,"I really enjoyed this workout DVD.  I used it well into my second trimester so far and haven't found any limitations.  I'm athletic but have been non-active for a while and it pushed me enough to feel like it was doing something without over doing it.  I would recommend this for all levels of fitness.  At one point, she suggests propping yourself up with pillows to do an abdominal exercise.  I found that using an exercise ball was much better because I couldn't get the pillows to offer the support I needed on my lower back.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.",1343606400,,574,4.471153846153846
2055608,5,B000227EMI,"I recommend this workout highly. Its relaxing, an fun. I love how she uses weights. Im a exercising junkie. I was doing p90x and p90x2 for a year and half, then when hit 16 weeks pregnant had to swap out for lowing impact, pregnancy workout. I feel awesome after doing this DVD. She does kegals and stability, core, just a all in one great DVD. Way better than other pregnancy workouts I have done with my first pregnancy. Only complain I have is shes has very low meek voice, with accent. Sometimes its hard to understand what the heck she is saying LOL~Sarah Pemberton Daegu, South Korea",1343174400,,589,4.514018691588785
2055609,4,B000227EMI,I have been using this DVD for my workouts at least once or twice a week since the beginning of my second trimester to complement my pilates sessions and swimming.  I started with the beginner level and have been working my way up to the advanced level.  I find that the workouts have remained challenging and fun.  I work up a good sweat mid way through the session and feel energized by the time the workout ends.  I highly recommend this DVD for any one who wants to remain fit throughout their pregnancy!,1343088000,,508,4.43010752688172

Due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I selected ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Vol. 1"" ... and I am thrilled with my decision.  I am 14 weeks pregnant and just completed the DVD for the first time.  Even at the beginner level, I feel well exercised.  My muscles are already sore! The host's explanation of each move is clear and the modifications for intermediate and advanced students means that I can work toward a more advanced routine without becoming bored with the program. I LOVE this DVD!!! I cannot recommend it enough.",1342915200,,621,4.951923076923077
2055611,2,B000227EMI,I was not happy with this workout DVD.  I felt some of the moves were too much for a woman who's late in her pregnancy.  If you regularly exercised before you got pregnant this is a great video for you. However if you do not exercise I don't think this is the video for you.,1342656000,,274,3.963636363636364
2055612,3,B000227EMI,"This is a great prenatal workout, but for me even the beginner level was a bit much. Before I became pregnant, I exercised quite a bit, and was in moderate shape. I've miscarried twice in the past and both times always exercised during the pregnancies. So, this time around, I guess you could say I've been a little paranoid about working out. Up until the 3rd trimester I took long walks but that was it. Anyway, I had ordered this DVD months back and at about 29 weeks decided to give it a go. I didn't push myself at all, stuck to beginner levels, and still it was extremely challenging for me. Later that night I had Braxton Hicks contractions and the baby was moving, kicking, stretching like crazy. My muscles and joints were in a lot of pain, but NOT the good kind of pain. So, while I think it was a good workout DVD, I don't think it was good for me.",1342051200,,859,4.2439024390243905
2055613,1,B000227EMI,I am certainly the oddball here because I thought this dvd was horrible.  I have a few other prenatal workouts and this one was used once.  For starters her voice bothered me and I know she can't change that but I felt I could get a bigger workout picking up toys in the living room.  This one wouldn't be bad for people who haven't worked out for very long or very little but I was doing Turbo Fire before I became pregnant and so this is way too easy for me.  Some of the moves made me laugh so I just donated it to the library.,1341446400,2,530,3.9716981132075473
2055614,5,B000227EMI,"If you're used to exercising daily and were very toned before baby, this DVD might be ""good"" but not ""great"" for trimester 1-2. BUT for trimester 3 it's great :) It's a full 45 minutes of working out, no fluff. I slept better the first night I tried it. Just get yourself a rug to workout on if you have a hardwood floor, 2 large pillows (I used my couch pillows) and a sturdy chair. You can use weights in the workout but I haven't yet.",1341014400,,437,4.093023255813954
2055615,5,B000227EMI,I started using this workout half way through my second pregnancy and man what a difference it made!!! I was having horrible hip and lower back pain for weeks until I started using this workout every other day. Right away it got rid of the pain! It was incredible! I felt such a big difference on nights when I used this work out! I did it every other night until I delivered and it was such a big difference from my first pregnancy. I felt much better and slept better. My body felt SO tight when I had to skip a couple days. I lost some weight and was slimming down within a couple weeks especially in my hips. I have continued using it after delivery to help me recover faster and it has been wonderful! Can't say enough good things about this DVD! I recommend it to every pregnant friend I know!,1340928000,,799,4.228758169934641
2055616,2,B000227EMI,"I exercise all the time. I have done P90X, Insanity, Asylum, Chalene Extreme - you name it! I am halfway through my pregnancy and have been continuing to do the workouts mentioned. I wanted to try a pregnancy workout that would be challenging enough for my level of fitness but where I could learn what is safe to do during pregnancy. This workout is not it. Even the advanced option in the program feels like I'm hardly doing anything. I did not sweat - at all - and I did not feel sore the next day. I still gave this DVD a 2-star rating because it is better than any other pregnancy workout that I have found. It does SOMETHING, but hardly anything. Parts of it were similar to the Winsdor Pilates DVDs. This DVD is just no where close to my fitness level. I guess I will keep up with my Insanity and P90X because I don't think that an advanced level pregnancy workout exists :(",1340409600,,881,4.281437125748503
2055617,2,B000227EMI,"This video is definitely challenging. It's not easy to find prenatal workouts that will get you to break a sweat (if you're already in very good shape).

With that said, if I could go back in time I wouldn't buy this DVD. First of all, the length of the workout is too long for me. I usually work out for about 30 minutes. A 50 minute + workout isn't practical for me, and there's no way (that I could find) to select components of the workout to focus on.

Second, I think it's kind of boring. By the end I'm frustrated by the workout and I just want it to be over. It's not a fun workout.

Finally, even though I don't see any visible scratches, this DVD skips all the time!

So again, I wouldn't recommend this DVD.",1340150400,,718,4.143884892086331

2055619,4,B000227EMI,"This workout is a perfect all over body workout that leaves you feeling stronger and more energized. The only complaint I have is that is is kinda pricey so it seems like there should be more than just one workout on the DVD. Either way, it was money well spent and I enjoy it each time I do it!",1339632000,,295,4.016949152542373
2055620,4,B000227EMI,"This is my first review ever but I just tried the video today and I had to write a review because I was really impressed. I'm about 17 weeks along with my first baby, and I'm in pretty decent shape.

I enjoyed her pretty accent, it was kind and soothing. The music was also enjoyable to listen to, but mainly kept in the background. You could use a chair (a sturdy one with no wheels) and also a step (I used my hubby's metal guitar case) for some of the exercises, but it's not necessary. Also, you'll need some big fluffy pillows for the abdominal exercises.

 It's great because she demonstrates all three levels of fitness--beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Usually, the bulk of the workout is demonstrated in beginner mode, with brief flashes on the screen of the other poses if you were to choose intermediate or advanced. I opted for a healthy mix of all three because I just couldn't hack it at the advanced level the whole time! :p

This workout WILL have you feeling that familiar lactic acid burn and make you feel like you accomplished something. The instructor is in phenomenal shape, and she's an inspiration, not to mention the workout itself is fantastic. My goal is to make it to advanced/expert level and be able to do the workout with ease at this level (HA. HA.). Anyway, even if you're not in great shape, the beginner level is very user-friendly and easy to do. You can really make progress with your fitness level with this video!

It's definitely worth the money!",1337731200,,1491,4.590225563909774
2055621,5,B000227EMI,"I love this video and highly reccommend it. I chose this and am really happy that I did . The excercises seemed easy at first and a bit relaxing, but by the time the arm workouts started, I was sweating and had to take a fast break from a couple of the excersizes. I felt great afterwards and the next day my arms, thighs, and booty were very sore. I still have not made it 100 percent through all of the excersizes, but I am thrilled with the progress I have been making so far. It makes it so I want to do these workouts everyday and it makes it so I feel happier and more accomplished. I really like how Karyne gets to the point and just does the excersizes. She also has a smile during some of the excersizes that motivates me to try harder.  The video is about 43 minutes and it goes by fast. I love it!",1337212800,,808,4.0186335403726705

I was worried any pregnancy workout would be too easy, but this one is not.  I do mostly the beginner moves now, and it is not easy.  I am glad, too, that there are two other levels to move up to.  Combined with some cardio, this workout should have anyone's pregnant body looking great.  It is a bit strange because there is a voice over; the person in the video is not talking while showing you the moves.  It is also not set up like a traditional workout video; there is not much preparation for different moves, but after only a couple of times, you know what comes next.  Also, it is helpful to know that you will need a chair, a mat, and large pillows.  Also, if you want to do any of the intermediate or advanced moves, you will need a stair step and hand weights.",1335916800,,897,4.1686046511627906

I went 4 times a week at the gym up until my 17th week when the pregnancy hit me hard. I decided at that point to just work out at home. I do this dvd back to back with Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix or Crunch Yoga Momma. Recently though, I have been getting major back pain so I decreased the amount of the floor pilates exercises I was doing in one of the sections of video. I think that may have contributed to some of my lower back pain. This video gives you the option to do beginner, intermdeiate, and advanced. I only do the beginner or intermediate just because I have a fear of falling on my stomach or have trouble breathing.

I loved lifting weights/body pump/Insanity workouts until I was pregnant, and I was very cautious after a previous miscarriage not to overdo it this time around.

Now that I'm 12 weeks pregnant I was looking for something with just enough challenge. This video fits the bill! I think my arms will be really toned and ready for baby by the end of this pregnancy. Not too hard but I know I will be sore tomorrow. Perfect! Plus there are different levels so you can always challenge yourself or take it a bit easier depending on the day.  I also love how she incorporates Kegels exercises into the routine because I always forget to do those! I highly recommend this video :),1333843200,,655,4.32520325203252

She occasionally moves quickly between the different exercises, but after the first time, it's not a problem at all.  I love how she has different moves for beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercisers.  I find that I rotate between these levels based on the particular exercise (and based on where I was in my pregnancy!).  This DVD is fun, and it has kept me in very good shape.  I rotate between this DVD, walking, and a prenatal yoga DVD, and feel like I've covered all of my bases, fitness-wise.  I would definitely recommend this DVD!",1333756800,,738,4.503759398496241

After trying the DVD, it is a definitely a challenging workout that left me sore the next day, which is what I wanted.  The positive is that she works every part of your body, so it is a total body workout.  One negative is that it made my hips feel tight, not good sore the next day. I want to loosen and strengthen my hips during pregnancy, not make them tight!  Also, the video is done in a dingy gym (not very professional). I also felt like it moved very quickly from one thing to the next.

They do some leg work, but from my running I am pretty toned in the legs already. I know doing a lot of ab work is pointless when prego, but I think the side abs and upper can be kept in shape. The video is pretty low budget, the french girl's voice is a little strange, but if you look past that it's a pretty good video for a pregnant woman trying to stay toned. The good thing about this video is that even though it was a little easy for me right now, I think the larger I get the better it will be for me to keep toned.

The Perfect Pregnancy DVD offers all levels of fitness from beginner to advance for every routine. It incorporates warm up/cool down stretching, lower body exercises with/without weights as well as low impact cardio. I am looking forward to using this program throughout my pregnancy.

Right when I am starting to struggle to finish a set, it switches to a new activity.  It also shows beginner, intermediate, and advanced moves to keep the workout challenging.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to any pregnant woman who wants a workout DVD that will keep them toned.  The DVD works the leg, core, and arm muscle groups. I bought this DVD when I was three months pregnant.  It is appropriate for any stage of pregnancy.

Bonus: The DVD has a chapter that is all about safety during the workout.  I would highly recommend this DVD for the safety section alone.  It gives very helpful advice and tips to modify your workout all throughout your pregnancy.",1330041600,,829,4.741258741258742

2055635,5,B000227EMI,"I spent time reading reviews on different workout DVDs and settled on the Pregnancy Workout Vol 1 based on the other reviews I have read and I am glad I did.  I do workout, but had slacked off a lot while we were trying to get pregnant so I can't say that I am in great shape starting out the video, but I find it doable.  Earlier this year I had been doing the Jilian Michael's 30 day shred which I loved, but felt like it would be too much during pregnancy and I think this is a good substitute.  It also reminds me of my Pilates videos the way the leg kick series is designed.  I have only used this a few days, but my legs and arms do feel stronger.  I plan to spend time with this most every morning as long as I feel up to it (I am 11.5 weeks).  Another note: This is only a strength training video - it does get my heart rate up, but has no aerobic workout to it so don't be expecting that.

A lot of reviewers complained about the production quality.  There is nothing wrong with the production quality.  It isn't loud, bright, and bouncy like aerobic videos, however the quality is good. It is dark everywhere but her, however I don't know what else you would be trying to see.  She does a voice over and isn't directly talking into the camera and I think this works better as she isn't grunting or straining as she is explaining the moves.

Other reviews complained about the difficulty or questioned the exercises.  All seem safe - especially if you are on the beginner level.  Some of the advance moves seem ""risky"" for my taste, but I am by no means an advanced exerciser and I think they would be perfectly fine for someone who is.  As far as the ab workout, it is relatively short compared to the rest of the video, and I don't see how doing it could cause any damage, but if you don't feel comfortable you could always stretch or do another move during this short section. There was also some complaining about it concentrating more on arms, but if you pay attention during the exercises you will realize during all the arm strength you are also standing in a position to work the muscles in your legs, and I'm sorry, but don't we want strong arms to hold these growing babies??

There were some complaints about the pace of the video (switching between exercises).  I've never found a workout video that I could switch back and forth between moves effortlessly on the first few viewings.  Once you know what comes next, there is be no problem in changing exercises.

My advice - watch the instruction section before beginning (it is really helpful) - have everything ready that you'll need (mat, chair and optional arm weights and step stool) and your workout should be great.  I have fun with this workout, she adds keigels into the workout (how helpful!!!) and the arm circles at the end really help me feel empowered to go through childbirth (3 minutes to build up your pain tolerance).  I look forward to being a really cute preggo women with this!!!",1328572800,4,2971,4.377049180327869
2055636,5,B000227EMI,"Prior to being pregnant I used to workout to Jillian's videos.  This video is the closest thing I've found to anything tough like Jillian.  I highly recommend it.  Being in my third trimester now I'm still able to do this video and find it to be very physically rewarding. Thank you Karen!

I will say, the voice over and the music is a bit odd but that doesn't really matter when you are getting a good workout!",1328486400,2,412,4.311688311688312
2055637,5,B000227EMI,An all around good video.  Good music and instruction. Challenging but not too challenging for pregnancy. It's a much better video than 'pregnancy fitness' and sanders 'prenatal fitness'. I thought is was a nice combination of stretching and toning.,1328400000,,249,5.384615384615385
2055638,5,B000227EMI,"Personally, I hate workout videos. They are always hard to follow and you never break a sweat. This video, however, breaks the mold. It is very challenging and you will sweat and be sore afterwards. It is so perfect for preganancy because just as you feel like you can't do anymore, she provides relief, and then you are moving on to the next exercise. Plus there are beginner and advanced modifications. It's perfectly timed and will keep you in shape during your pregnancy. One thing though, you will not be able to rely on this video alone, you will need to pair it with some type of cardio such as walking or using an elliptical. As a woman who did vigorous workouts before pregnancy such as spinning, cardio kickboxing, and running between 3-7 miles at a clip, I strongly recommend this video. Let's face it, when your pregnant no matter how good of shape you were in before you became pregnant, you just cannot do what you did before....buy this!!!!",1328227200,,955,4.623529411764705

It really is that good! I feel amazing after doing this workout. It is challenging. I also own Lindsay Brins Pregnancy DVD set and that doesn't even come close to this workout. Its quick too.",1328054400,,358,3.9178082191780823
2055640,5,B000227EMI,"This dvd is a bit ""vintage"" however, I give it a 2 thumbs up.  This video is perfect for those searching for a pregnancy yoga DVD that is challenging to both beginner and experienced athlete. As a former runner/70.3 athlete, I didn't thing a yoga dvd would challenge me, but she exceeded my expectations.  Great workout, stretching, and breathing exercises that are applicable and adjustable to all stages of one's pregnancy.",1326844800,,425,4.971830985915493
2055641,5,B000227EMI,I am three months pregnant. Since the start of my pregnancy I have felt lethargic and sick. Before pregnancy I was going to yoga regularly - even going to yoga was not helping me to feel better. I decided try the Perfect Pregnancy Workout for the first time this morning.  The workout helped me to engage muscles in a deeper way than in yoga and was the perfect pace. The modifications made it easy to follow along and choose when I wanted to go with the beginner or advances exercise. Today is the first day of my pregnancy that I feel like I have a little extra hop in my step! I highly recommend the Perfect Pregnancy Workout.,1326585600,,629,4.330508474576271
2055642,5,B000227EMI,"This is a great workout.  It only takes about 45 minutes and you are provided with different varieties of each move (beginner, intermediate and advanced) depending on where you in your own fitness.  It's nice to because she is pregnant.  It starts with a warmup and ends with a cooldown.  I definitely felt the workouts doing their job and was a bit sore the next day, which is a good sign.  I hope to move up the intermediate and advanced moves as I go through the workout.",1326412800,,474,4.402298850574713
2055643,5,B000227EMI,"I really enjoy this video! By the end, I am sweating, feel like I put in work, and feel it the next day, as well. It is a really balanced workout, with exercises for lower and upper body.

I noticed one of the reviewers wasn't too happy with the DVD and chose to stick to modified P90x workouts. I suppose if you are in impeccable shape going into your pregnancy, this might not be a challenging workout. I was in great shape about 6 months before my pregnancy. My workouts typically consisted of 30-45 minutes of cardio, and 45 minutes of weight training with 10 and 15 pound weights. I did this 4-5 times per week. However, going into my pregnancy I was working out only about 2-3 times per week.  And by month six of my pregnancy, my workouts are not the same as they were pre-pregnancy.

This video is great for sculpting. In fact, the instructor specifically mentions it's her sculpting workout and that she combines it with biking and swimming. I am happy with this DVD because I see and feel results, while knowing that it is safe for my body and my baby.",1325376000,2,1062,4.380710659898477
2055644,4,B000227EMI,"There were definitely some parts of this video that I laughed at, but generally speaking it's a pretty good workout!  I consider my self to be in pretty good shape, and there were some parts where I was definitely breathless and/or having difficulty pushing through muscle fatigue (I did the advanced version of the workout).

This will be a staple during my second trimester.  I don't think I'll be able to do some of the moves during the third trimester though.  I also don't like the crunches, and wish the actual workout portion was a little bit longer.",1325289600,,557,4.653061224489796
2055645,2,B000227EMI,"I read all the reviews for this dvd before purchasing and was really hoping for more...  The work out is okay, in regards to a challenge but is really creepy from beginning to end.  This is not like any workout dvd I have ever seen with just 1 person doing the exercises in a dark room with a voice over of the instructions.  I do wish I could skip over some portions and/or it was split up into sections rather than going through the whole dvd warm up to cool down.

My fitness level was pretty good going into pregnancy; Pre-pregnancy I worked out about 3 days a week, strength training mostly but also ran and did fitness classes occasionally.

Some of the exercises you can make more challenging but overall I find it pretty boring and again, a bit creepy.  I do like that it seems to focus on exercises that will help with labor and delivery but this is my first child so only time will tell if that is accurate, if I can get myself to do this boring dvd on a regular basis...",1324944000,,981,4.219251336898396
2055646,5,B000227EMI,"Now that the weather has gotten colder here and I can't get outside as much, I have been trying a few DVDs for exercise, and this one is phenomenal.  This woman is so fit and beautiful, it is really inspirational to watch.  She doesn't talk alot and the exercises are easy to figure out.  They are challenging, but if it gets too difficult there are beginner, intermediate, and advanced options to try.  I usually do a mixture of the three depending on the exercise.  I am a fan of world beat style music so that's another thing I really like about this video.  It starts out with a nice stretching warm up and ends with a relaxing cooldown.  She includes kegels, labor squats, and a ""keep up"" exercise that are geared toward labor & delivery, and at least 12 other moves for total body fitness. The other moves have been altered just enough that you feel safe doing them while pregnant but still feel like its making you stronger.  I get compliments all the time about how great I look at 24 weeks and I credit this video - which I have done weekly since about 10 weeks, plus walking outside or on a treadmill for 30 minutes twice a week. I have tried other DVDs for a fit pregnancy and they were too easy, repetitive and/or annoying, but this one truly is perfect!",1324080000,,1266,4.380341880341881
2055647,5,B000227EMI,"I had been working out to the P90X videos for some time as well as speed walking about 3 times a week. I was FINALLY satisfied with the way my body looked in a bathing suite.

When I found out I was pregnant i worried about all the hard work going out the window... I am 38 years old the last time i was pregnant i was 23 years old. I remember how hard it was even at that age to get my body back to ""normal""

I searched Amazon for a workout that wouldn't be too easy and still be ok to do while pregnant. After reading reviews on this DVD i took a chance and ordered it for myself. Unfortunately the first couple months the last thing i wanted to do was work out... Just looking at the cover of this DVD made my stomach turn... I am now 20 weeks along and FINALLY able to handle the work out.

At first i tried the yoga work out for pregnant women that i bought at the same time i purchased this DVD but i was left feeling like i was not challenging my body at all. I can't stand working out for an hour and not breaking a sweat or feeling even a tiny bit of muscle burn.

This DVD was NOT like that. After working out (45min) to this video i felt like i was actually getting something done. The next day i felt the familiar light muscle aches that i had been missing. I'm not in PAIN... but i do feel like i am getting a workout.

The instruction is good.. easy and not hard on your body at all.. (nothing like P90X) It is just right for me not to easy and not to hard.
While you are working out it will demonstrate advanced moves as well as a beginner version.

I am very happy with this purchase and am very excited to see results. I have only been doing this for two days, but i can feel the burn in my thighs, shoulders and back... FINALLY i don't feel like a lazy couch potato anymore... Just because you are pregnant does not mean you cant maintain your body in a safe and healthy way.",1323820800,3,1893,3.968421052631579

Great to know I have a workout thats good all the way to the end of my 9 months.",1323734400,,269,4.4
2055649,5,B000227EMI,"I must have bought 4 other pregnancy DVD's before I found this one. The issue I have found with most pregnancy workouts is that they are pretty much a joke, I could do them 5 times in a row and still not get a workout. I was sick of wasting my time with lame and too easy workouts. I got ""The perfect pregnancy Workout vol. 1"" and immediately I could tell it was working. I was a little sore the next day so I knew it was a work out that was not a waste of time. I recommend this to all my girl friends!",1323648000,,503,3.8
2055650,5,B000227EMI,"After my first trimester when I didn't really feel like working out, I ordered three prenatal workout DVD's from Amazon:  The Perfect Pregnancy Workout volume 1, Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout, and Denise Austin's Fit and Firm Pregnancy.  I ordered these three because they all had excellent reviews and I wanted to make sure I had a variety of exercises at my fingertips.  I really think that I chose an excellent combination because I have come to love all three of these DVD's for different reasons over the course of my pregnancy.  I'll review each program individually, but I did want to point out that I had all three and I highly recommend using this strategy.  It lets you have variety and gives you options for days when you really feel like getting a good workout in (Perfect Pregnancy workout) versus those days when it takes a lot of self-convincing to even do anything but sit on the couch (Denise Austin).

The Perfect Pregnancy Workout volume 1 has been a lot of fun for me to use for the past months as I've progressed in my pregnancy.  While I started out the DVD following along on the beginner track, I slowly was able to progress to intermediate and advanced in different areas, and eventually all areas of the DVD.  That makes me feel really good to look back and realize that I got stronger throughout my pregnancy, with a lot of thanks to this DVD.  It is fast-paced enough for me to be focused the whole time on what I'm doing (and not looking at the clock) and it is strenuous enough that I break a sweat and really feel like I am working out.  The music is soothing and energetic at the same time and her voice overs have no extras, just instructions.  It really works well to keep you focused.  Now, here I am 38.5 weeks pregnant and still completing the exercises a few times a week.  I think that's really saying something.

I highly recommend this exercise DVD to you if you want a challenge and you want to get stronger over the course of your pregnancy.  You will feel challenged, but not overwhelmed.  It really is great.  I'll miss it when I'm not pregnant anymore.",1322438400,,2100,4.5132275132275135

If I did this DVD 4-5 days in a row at times during my pregnancy, my body was SOLID.  It goes super fast and is smart.
I don't want to jump around while pregnant or not pregnant.  Just want a smart workout as fast as i can get one.  My husband and friends all comment on how fit I am for being 36 weeks. I thank this DVD and some light cardio for 30 minutes on other days.  (typically work out 4-5 days a week for 45 min)

LOVED IT!",1321142400,,546,3.864864864864865
2055653,4,B000227EMI,this is a fun workout. I like how there's a few exercises with beginner/advanced levels. The exercises are more focused on muscle building/definition than cardio. It would have been nice to have a little cardio section on the DVD.,1320796800,,230,4.923076923076923
2055654,1,B000227EMI,"I was totally disappointed!!!!!!

I read the other reviews and felt possitive about purchasing this video. I was actually excited about trying it.  Big Mistake! I can see where this video might be beneficial if you're 9 months pregnant, about to pop, and just want to get up and move around...or if you've never worked out a day in your life and have been instructed by your doctor to do so.  But as far as feeling like you benefited from a great work out, this video does not provide that result.

Between the leg lifts (really? who still does those?) and other extremely basic (beginner level although it says advanced) aerobic moves, I was completely bored by this work out.  The Kegel excercises are nice, but I can do those sitting on my couch watching t.v.  There are a few weight lifting excercises, but nothing I expected nor benefited from. Perhaps I'm more in shape than the general populas (which is not hard to be these days seeing as how hardly anyone takes care of themselves anymore.) but I think I'll stick to my modified P90X workouts and running",1320710400,,1063,4.597883597883598
2055655,2,B000227EMI,This exercise DVD is very boring!  I can't imagine sticking to this for the duration of my pregnancy.  I did this once and find it hard to motivate to do it again.

2055656,3,B000227EMI,"While the cover of the DVD is definitely a little intimidating, I bought it anyway because the reviews were so amazing. The woman is a professional acrobat and is incredibly fit. I did enjoy listening to her and I thought the exercises were pretty well thought out with LOTS of repetitions, which is nice when you're just learning a routine the first few times. However, this was way too hard for me. I ran semi-regularly before I got pregnant (completed a 7.6 mile race in the first trimester) but was in no way in super great shape. As my pregnancy progressed I became more and more sedentery and I thought this DVD would jump start my fitness regime. Bad idea. I do want to try this video again as I think it's a great workout and something to aspire to. Unfortunately it's so difficult that I'm having a hard time getting motivated to try it again.",1319414400,,852,4.467948717948718

Would also be excellent for those who want to get fit during pregnancy as it as an easy level in it as well but still makes you work ;) I don't regret this purchase at all!",1318550400,,549,4.5

She's very flexible, so it's hard for me to match her exactly, but I'm just starting out. Even so, I get a great workout (break a sweat!) and feel great afterward.

All 3 types of moves are displayed at once on the screen in a non distracting way that way you don't have a pause or any interruptions in the workout. Her voice is very gentle and soothing and she is great with prompts and directions. The music is also excellent- very relaxing and yet upbeat when it needs to be...puts me totally at ease during the workout. Everything is covered in the workout leaving you feeling extremely satisfied at the end. I prefer low impact workouts for my knees and I didn't find anything to be too taxing to perform. Alot of the moves are also moves that my midwife has recommended doing and she includes kegals into the workout...so it is definitely a complete pregnancy workout. I honestly think that I am in better shape now at 34 weeks pregnant than I was prepregnancy thanks to this workout!

2055677,5,B000227EMI,"I am six months pregnant, and wanted a dvd basically to keep strong during my pregnancy, and bought this one and Baby Bells by Lauren Brooks, which both fit the bill perfectly and were exactly what I was after.  I'm a pretty fit and active person, some would say very fit and active;), and in my other pregnancies I was afraid to do too much so basically just walked through my pregnancies. I was in my early twenties when I had my first two children, so it wasn't so much of a problem bouncing back. But with my third pregnancy a couple of years ago I found it harder losing the weight and getting fit and strong again after my pregnancy, and now at 40 expecting my fourth baby, I wanted to keep up some sort of strengthening programme during my pregnancy aside from walking and swimming, but which felt safe as well.  I love this workout with Karyne.  It provides a good toning/strengthening workout, which you can adapt according to how you feel or your capability by doing the beginning/intermediate/advanced options she has available on the screen.  I like her instructions, which are clear, but don't dominate the entire dvd.  I'm enjoying this workout, and feel great afterwards.",1311724800,,1186,4.655502392344498
2055678,4,B000227EMI,This video provides a great workout - they show all excercises in three stages so you can choose what is right for you based on your strength (and what month of pregnancy you are in!).  It gives a great workout with safe and 'easy to do' moves.,1311638400,,244,4.191489361702128
2055679,5,B000227EMI,"This workout is just what I was looking for and even more!  The workout is awesome - not too easy, not too hard.  I definitely feel like this is my most challenging workout of the week because I can tailor it to how I'm feeling.  The beginnner, intermediate, and advanced moves are all demonstrated and shown for each move during the workout, so you can continue moving along no matter which one you're doing.  And, if you get too tired during one, you can switch to a different version without having to stop the workout.  What I love is that this workout, and every volume (1,2, or 3) includes Kegel exercises right in the workout.  I just don't do them otherwise.  Oh, one more thing - each volume also has a challenge.  This challenge involves some physical activity that requires mental focus so they can teach you how to get your mind off the labor pains you will be experiencing in a few months.  I LOVE this workout - great investment and a fantastic way to stay in shape during pregnancy!",1311552000,,997,4.464088397790055

I was extremely athletic before I got pregnant & was hoping to be able to keep somewhat in shape with 'pregnancy-safe' exercises.  This video did the trick! I did this video 3 times per week (and did cardio every other day) & loved the results.  I actually felt stronger than I did before I was pregnant.  The video has beginner, intermediate, & advanced variations for some of the workouts and I loved being able to get a good strength training in while being pregnant.

2055682,5,B000227EMI,"I did regular cardio my first trimester but started this video in the second and mostly last trimester. It was great for toning arms, opening up the hips, getting the gluts strong, core work. I did the cardio section with 5 lb weights in hand and some times with leg weights. The cardio was sufficient but not quite enough for me but on noncardio days this was perfect. I especially loved the end exercise where you do arm circles for 5 min to mimic labor pain and learn to work through it. I admit it feels nowhere near what a contraction feels like but it is an exercise to teach you how to bear through a tough time .  It really tones the triceps. Also the leg section is great for inner and outer thigh and flexibility. She has a fake hair ponytail that looks silly but other than that I enjoy watching and doing this video and it definitely has the toning you will need to maintain your muscle and build some for labor day. My non pregnant friends did this video with me and they felt sore the next day. And they exercise regularly.",1309132800,2,1037,4.290816326530612
2055683,5,B000227EMI,"Prior to trying the Perfect Pregnancy Workout video, I tried MANY other prenatal/pregnancy workout videos. I was constantly disappointed. Before I became pregnant, I was an avid exerciser. I worked out most days of the week--jogging or doing more intense exercise videos like P90X or those by Jillian Michaels. Up through most of my first and second trimester, I continued to do some of the non-pregnancy videos I had and just modified them because I couldn't find any pregnancy videos that made me feel like I was getting any exercise.

Now in my third trimester, modifying regular workouts is a lot more difficult. Also, I really wanted to incorporate moves/stretches/exercises that help get you prepared for labor and ease common aches and pains. After reading many Amazon reviews on various videos, I decided to try the Perfect Pregnancy workout and couldn't be happier that I did. It was the FIRST and only workout that actually made me feel like I was getting a workout. I feel like it will help me stay strong and will get me ready for delivery. It takes all the necessary safety precautions. Plus, it always gives and demonstrates a beginner and advanced version of the moves. So if you aren't advanced, you can do the beginner. I find myself doing some advanced and some beginner moves. I really look forward to how good I feel while doing and after doing this workout.

If you're looking for a good workout, look no further than this video. I have rented (either via Netflix or from my local libraries) at least 10 other videos and while I found a couple that were good for days when I was tired, many of them felt like they wouldn't be challenging for even a 90-year old out-of-shape sickly person. What is the point--better to go for a walk than waste time on videos like that.

Get this video! You won't be disappointed.",1309046400,,1833,4.70404984423676

I just tried this for the first time and it was AMAZING!!! I love how straight forward the movements are and it gives you a great workout, but I didn't feel exhausted after. I know I will be feeling it even more later... in a good way! I will defiantly be buying the other DVDs in this set!!!

Before pregnancy I was switching between running, strength training and yoga 5-6 days a week. I was put on bed rest my first trimester and really wanted a video that would help build up my strength again without having to join the gym and do weights. This video is a full body workout and is able to challenge me without over doing it. I try to do this 3 days a week and walk 2-3 days a week at a brisk pace.

Lindsay Brin is better for arms/shoulders/back and yoga, and Erin O'Brien's is better for legs and cardio plus it comes with a video for after the baby is born. I would recommend buying one of the other two videos.",1307750400,,475,4.471264367816092
2055689,5,B000227EMI,"FIRST AND FOREMOST, UNDERSTAND THIS: THIS IS NOT A CARDIO WORK-OUT, THIS IS A STRENGTH WORKOUT WHICH IS MEANT TO BE DONE IN COMBINATION WITH A FORM OF CARDIO.
I read the reviews prior to this purchase, compared and contrasted the 1-star and 2-star reviews vs. the 5-star and 4-star reviews. The biggest complaints I gathered from the 1-star reviews were as follows: ""It hardly got my heart rate up"" or ""It was so boring"" or ""the background setting was dark"" or ""it moved too fast for me"". I believe these women suffer from piss-poor reading comprehension skills. This workout is not an aerobic workout, it is a strength and conditioning video. Who gives a crap about whether or not the background is dark?
What's even more laughable is the same people who gave this a 1-star or a 2-star rating all prefaced their reviews with, ""but I'm no stranger to exercise"" or ""I'm a pretty active individual""(one even gave her height and weight to 'prove' she was in shape prior to pregnancy and then complained that she got bored in the middle of it because she couldn't continue the workout because of the difficulty.
Then clearly you WERE NOT IN SHAPE!!!!
The bottom line here is that this is a great STRENGTH workout. If you're looking for a cardio work-out, then keep looking. Again, I repeat, this is meant to be done in combination(on other days) with a form of cardio.
I'm 30 years old and this is my first pregnancy. I can actually say that I'm not a stranger to exercise(and mean it). I've done my share of gyms, but above all, I've trained in a Korean martial art for years and dabbled in Mixed Martial Arts(Muay Thai, Wrestling) and found this DVD to be a great work-out. Obviously, I cannot continue my martial art, wrestling and Muay Thai training during this time period, so I found this to be a great substitute.
And for the record, if you ""think"" you're in good shape and then come here to give a bad review because the DVD was too difficult, then you weren't in good shape to begin with. A great test to determine if you're in great shape, is: spare with someone for 5 minutes, hell not even five minutes, three minutes and if you can't hang for at least 45 seconds, then you = not good shape. Just because you're not fat, doesn't mean you're in good shape. Or a much more simple test to determine your level of fitness is to do the Plyo or Core DVD from P90X...if you can hang, then you should be able to do this DVD and feel great. Again, not a cardio DVD....a STRENGTH DVD. It's awesome.",1307318400,4,2496,4.463894967177243
2055690,5,B000227EMI,"This workout is fantastic!  I am a professional dancer, and once I was no longer dancing professionally due to my pregnancy and found running too high impact for my growing belly I was concerned as to how I would stay in shape throughout the remainder of my pregnancy.

  Most prenatal workouts are simply not workouts, most are yoga and pilates, which I have practiced regularly, yet once you try prenatal workouts they treat you like an invalid.  This video is geared to people who really are in great shape and workout regularly, not people who just think they are in great shape.

  The upper body work is great, as a dancer I have always purposely kept a  petite upper body and this workout really makes me feel like I will have the strength to carry my baby for long periods of time.  Even with old back and shoulder injuries I am able to do the exercises and still get a workout.

  The pace is also great in this video.  Once you start you are off and rolling and actually getting your heart rate up and keeping it there, which is what is required for a real workout.  I feel that this workout will truly help to keep my stamina up for labour.

  Any complaints about this DVD are from people who THINK they know how to work out or are in shape and ARE NOT.  No one is getting a real workout in ten minutes!  This is only 45 minutes including warm up and cool down, which is a perfect amount of time.  If you want to workout for ten minutes, you don't actually want to work out!  The scenery and music may not be the most appealing, but it is certainly worth it to actually get a work out.  Also any complaints from people about number of reps or the constant changing of positions also just don't know anything about working out and what gets you a workout.

  In summary, if you are serious about staying in shape for your pregnancy this is the video for you.  If you are looking for calming exercises......go to Lamaze classes, you don't actually want a workout.  It is also a good idea to pair this workout with a yoga DVD to improve your flexibility for labour.  My only complaint is that I would like a bit more lower body work, but I am able to get that myself in other ways.  This is a fantastic purchase and I recommend it to anyone who was serious about the shape they were in before they were pregnant and want to maintain it for their babies sake and an easier labour.",1306368000,2,2388,4.289237668161435

She always shows the beginner, intermediate, and advanced level workout on the screen, so you always have one to follow along to. The instructional portion of the video is definitely a bonus, where she goes over a slew of information and should answer most questions you have. I think this will be a good video to use after baby gets here, just to try to keep in better shape until you're able to get out and be a lot more active too.

The instructor moves very quickly from exercise to exercise, which can be a little chaotic.  However,once you get familiar with the workout the transitions become easier.
The best part is that I feel like I have actually worked out, and the highest my heart rate got to was 133.  Perfect.",1304035200,2,447,4.620253164556962

It leaves me feeling like I've done something but not out of breath.  I do the Advanced moves in the video and if you've never worked out before the beginner moves will be challenging enough. I worked out 3 days a week and did cardio 2 days a week prior to becoming pregnant and was unable to keep up with that normal work out so this video was just what I needed.",1303776000,,534,4.037735849056604

What I did not know was what exercises are safe in pregnancy and the video has a section to tell you about it. Also I like it that there are 3 different levels - you can do basic, intermediate and advanced exercises.

Have been doing this workout 3 times a week. The results are amazing. I can see how toned my legs are now and I really like the stomach exercises. I would actually have loved more stomach exercises. Also can feel a big difference in my Kegel's muscles which is important for me - I want to prevent incontinence after delivery.

I look and feel fantastic, my arms which never had a lot of definition also are starting to look toned. I still do not look pregnant, and am now a bit over 4 mo. along. And before I started the exercises, my stomach was getting to be rather big.

I do this workout combined with 10 Minute Solution - Prenatal Pilates and the results are amazing. If you want to have a great body during your pregnancy, I definitely recommend both videos highly.",1303689600,,1164,4.37962962962963

This is my second pregnancy and it took me quite a while to get off the baby weight. My hope is that working out and eating less sugar this time around will help me get back to my pre-baby weight a little quicker.

The girl is a gymnast for a circus or something and has muscles i dont. She does have different levels of intensity but even on the easiest level my legs hurt so bad the next day.

I am not a huge fan of the voice over narrating, since it seems a bit odd to me, but I got used to it and this actually became one of my favorite workouts.  The only downside to this DVD is that there are no special workouts for each trimester, just 1 workout which is for all of pregnancy which may be a little tough when you're in the last trimester. Although, there are always beginner, intermediate and advanced variations which I liked.  (I'm 6 months along so I don't yet know how doing this in the 3rd tri will be.) It's about 45 minutes total including warm up and cool down, and I am always tired at the end which I like, since I frequently worked out before getting pregnant and like to feel tired when I'm done.

I really get unmotivated if I am ready to workout and I have to sit through the same 3 minutes of intro and tips every time I play the DVD. I pop this one in, select ""workout"" and it begins.

As far as the actual workout goes, it makes me feel so relaxed and the movements are so fluid and comfortable. I am sweating when I'm finished, but not exhausted. Karyne has a slight French accent which I find soothing and the music had to have been designed from the team at Cirque du Soliel because it is soothing and relaxing, but motivating and has a great beat to it that flows with her movements.

2055708,1,B000227EMI,"OK, I admit it.  When I read the reviews that said this video was difficult, I scoffed.  Well, the joke is on me, I am a big jerk.  This workout isn't just hard, it's borderline impossible unless you are already in pretty good physical condition - not just active, but actively working out regularly.  I am just starting my second trimester, so I'm not huge yet.  I'm not in terrific shape, but I'm far from sedentary - I walk 3 miles on hilly country roads with the dog a couple of times a week, and have throughout my pregnancy.  I made it maybe 20 minutes into this video, doing only the beginner level moves before I just couldn't do any more.  More than that, I felt like a complete and total failure.  I'll admit it:  I cried.

If you are already in very good physical shape and you pick this up early on in pregnancy, I'm sure this will keep you toned; however it is a terrible choice for women looking to get in shape for later pregnancy and labor - which is, I believe how it is advertised!  I also suspect that very few women could continue to use this video far into the third trimester - some of the positions just seem like they would be impossible with a large belly (e.g., holding a lunge position, leaning forward over the front knee, to do arm extensions).  There are *no* modifications for later pregnancy, unlike other videos I have seen.

The ""warm up"" portion of the video is insufficient - she does very limited stretching.  Some of the exercises were tough for me to do simply because I hadn't stretched enough to really get into the proper position.  Especially considering that ligaments loosen during pregnancy, increasing the potential for straining muscles, I found the lack of proper stretching and warm up distressing and dangerous.

This video might be good for a very limited number of women, and for a very limited time during pregnancy, but misses the opportunity to reach a broader audience by offering better modifications for those who are farther along in pregnancy or not already trapeze artists.",1300838400,,2035,4.595567867036011

It is challenging and varied enough to stay interesting, and I love the way the different levels (beginner, intermediate and advanced) are illustrated throughout. I am in my 2nd trimester, and after not exercising during my first trimester, I decided to stick with the beginner level and, boy am I glad I did. I worked up a sweat, and my body was sore the next day! I love that feeling! There are plenty of leg and arm workouts, along with some gentle ab exercises, and I especially liked the inclusion of the Kiegel exercises throughout, as I am not that good at remembering to do them on my own.
Excellent DVD, and a good length (42mins) which means you feel you have done a workout, without exhausting yourself.

I like that her voice is soothing instead of overly perky like in some workout videos. Overall it's a good strengthening workout for during your pregnancy.,1300320000,,306,5.26530612244898
2055713,4,B000227EMI,"I agree with another reviewer that this is largely strength training. While I want to increase muscle mass, I also want to get some cardio mixed in. This video just doesn't supply that. I must add that I am in very good shape and take it down a few notches during pregnancy. I did the Firm videos with my first pregnancy and they were perfect for me in terms of difficulty and combining cardio and weights.
The plus side- this is a great weight training and baby preparation video. I really like to do it, but it isn't my idea of perfect. I also do not like the several minutes of shoulder circles near the end, but maybe that is just preference.",1300233600,,646,4.30327868852459

I've worked out a lot prior to being pregnant so I am not new to exercise. I found this workout to be very odd. Many of the moves felt awkward and I didn't feel like I was working anything during large portions of the workout.

I actually looked forward to these vidoes and was really glad I invested the money and time into pregnancy work out videos.  I have never been a work out video person in the past (prefer the gym), but having some good workouts I could do at home were important during my pregnancy. This is really a perfect workout that was difficult and guaranteed to keep me in shape. The video does a great job of showing modifications for all levels. I was initially worried about it feeling like it wasn't ""hard"" enough and that I was wasting my time - but not the case at all!!  Wow, she kicked my butt!  The only down side is the instructor isn't very personable or super exciting to watch, but I was willing to overlook that because the workout is so great.  If instructora having a fun personality is important to you, I would recommend Erin OBrien pregnancy video as an alternative.  They are both really great videos and two different types of workouts!",1299888000,,1120,4.4926108374384235

2055718,5,B000227EMI,"When I was about 5 months pregnant, I was searching for a workout to perform: something safe, but also something that made me feel like I was actually doing something.  I was really impressed with the results I received from this workout.

Some people complained on their reviews about the dark lighting, the dreary background, and the voiceover.  I will admit, these weren't exactly the best, but the results you see and the way you feel after completing the workout completely make up for those drawbacks.  Not once during this workout did I feel that I was overexerting myself, but it was still challenging.  I feel that it really prepares the muscles you will need during labor and I felt an increase in energy immediately following and even into the next day, as with any exercise, it helped me sleep better also.  I alternate the workout with walking and light jogging on the treadmill.

Near the end of the workout, she has a few minutes where she does a ""Keeping Up Exercise.""  This really prepares you mentally for the challenge of labor.  At the beginning of this exercise, I didn't think I'd be able to do it, but I finished it, and have plans to add weights to it, once it gets easier.  She also incorporates Kegel exercises throughout the workout.

I have had issues with my hips, and she really works the hips in this workout, I'm excited to see how this workout positively affects the issues I've had with my hips.  The day after I completed the workout, I felt a little of the soreness you want to feel after a workout, this soreness assured me that I did workout.  I kept a close watch on my heartrate during the work out, and it was raised, but never to the point that doctors say is unsafe.

Thanks for this workout!  I plan to perform it 3 times a week until my baby comes!",1298851200,,1793,4.473846153846154

At the time I started the video I was 5 months pregnant and having back pain, lack of energy, and several other issues.  I knew it was due to the lack of movement, but it's winter time, and getting outside wasn't an option I have often.  I missed doing pilates and yoga and all of the things I do when I am not pregnant.  This video is a great mix of everything, and has made all of my pain disappear.  I feel like a new woman!

I am 32, have been physically active my whole life (running, gymnastics, dance, etc.) and have purchased a good number of good and bad workout tapes (tae bo, billy blank's boot camp, yoga for everyone (or something like that), bad, bad dance or step workouts from the 80s (or so it seemed), and others).  This video was the worst one I have purchased, even compared to those cheap ones most of you avoid buying at Ross, but I get suckered into buying.

The exercises are BORING, repetitive, and uninspired. The set - a dark gymnastics gym - and the cast - the instructor all by herself the entire time - left a lot to be desired. The filming is also a little odd -- with no close ups on the instructor's body position or different angles to let you see what the exercise is supposed to look like.  Instead, the cameraman/editor decided we'd really benefit from several close ups of the instructor's face for 5 seconds or more.  WHAT?  I don't need to see the instructor's face while she's doing an exercise.  I'd actually like to see the position of her body so I can figure out what she's doing.  At least the video got me out of bed and doing some exercises, but really, not much other than that.

I would NOT buy this product again, and recommend that you don't buy it at all.",1297814400,24,1444,4.418867924528302

I've been using this video since I was about 8 weeks (I'm now 32) and I love it. It's the perfect length (~45 minutes) and, for me, is the perfect level of difficulty. I had purchased two other prenatal workout videos but after trying the other two have only used this one because it feels more like a real workout. Karen is a great coach and never gets annoying. The exercises cover the entire body with modifications for beginner, intermediate and advanced so you can make it as challenging as you'd like. This was also a great help because early on in the pregnancy I was having back pain, but as soon as I started doing this workout regularly the pain disappeared ... well, I get a little bit getting out of bed in the morning but that's it.  A really big improvement, which is due to the back strengthening exercises on the video. I'm excited to try Karen's other video of exercises to do with the baby, once she arrives. :)",1296864000,,959,4.418079096045198

I agree that even if you're not pregnant you will get a good workout with this video. I am almost 7 months pregnant and have been working out a few times a week since I became pregnant. I never considered myself a beginner but this video definitely gave me a good workout at the beginner level. That makes me feel good because I know I will be able to keep it for the rest of my pregnancy without getting bored or feel like it's too easy. I definitely recommend this video to any woman who regularly works out and wants to maintain her shape during pregnancy. The only thing I would say is bad about the video is that there is only one workout so if you do it everyday you might get tired of the same routine. But I think I will switch between going to the gym and doing this video at home.

This is the second day I do the workout and I am sore! I rarely get sore from at home videos so to me that's a good sign I am getting a great workout. I recommend having a light pair of hand weights and step stool for intermediate and advanced users.",1296259200,,1204,4.123404255319149
2055723,5,B000227EMI,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write an Amazon review.  This DVD is like a lifesaver!  I was very active prior to pregnancy, pilates, running, biking, swimming.  The first trimester was like being possessed by aliens - getting through the day with exhaustion and nausea was a challenge, forget exercising.  But in my first month of pregnancy, I had optomistically purchased this DVD and Crunch Yoga Mama Prenatal Yoga.

I started doing Crunch Yoga Mama in my 4th month as my energy came back.  After a couple weeks, I switched to the Perfect Pregnancy Workout - Beginner level.  It was so exciting - it was the first thing I'd done in months that made pregnancy feel normal!  The DVD is fast paced, but every exercise is catering to the pregnant form.  Karen is inspiring - and very pregnant! (9 months?) - not talking too much, just enough to be sure that you're following the moves in the correct way.

After 4 tries at the beginner level, I switched to intermediate/advanced and have been doing the DVD twice a week since.  Now I'm in my 6th month and hoping to move up to 3x/week and add back in Yoga Mama once a week.

Yoga Mama is a great supplement with more stretching and perfect for those days when you want to move a bit, but don't feel too great or energetic.  (It's slow paced in comparison, slower than a regular yoga class, that's for sure.)  Both give you practice with your kegels!  I feel like the PPW is helping me 'train' for the big event of labor at the end of this process.  It's definitely giving me more confidence and control of my body.",1296000000,2,1578,4.465034965034965
2055724,5,B000227EMI,"This dvd provides an actual workout that will leave you sore, unlike other pregnancy dvds I have tried.  You have the option of choosing which level of workout is appropriate for you.  The instructor is pregnant and makes you feel comfortable with your changing body.  You do not need any extra equipment, just a chair and some pillows.  I enjoy working out and love this video.  I highly reccommend it!",1295740800,,403,4.7
2055725,5,B000227EMI,"I'm 18 weeks pregnant and I just finished my first workout with this DVD.  I'm just glad it made me sweat a little!  Although I have been in better shape, I'm still somewhat active in every day life (taking 4 flights of stairs instead of elevators and not needing to drive around parking lots for an hour to save walking 5 minutes out of my way, mostly).
I tried out the beginner workout today, mostly because I have been a bit cautious about rigorous exercises since I found out that I was pregnant and had some concerns in my first trimester.  I have only been doing yoga occasionally and mild hikes for 30-45 min a couple of times a week.  This video will certainly help get me back in shape if I add it to my routine.  I anticipate doing the intermediate version in the next week or two, and will hopefully feel comfortable enough to progress to advanced before labor!  It does what it is supposed to do: push you just enough, but not so much that it hurts.  I love that there are options for each exercise.

The instructor's voice is soothing but not boring, and not at all annoying like some other videos that I have seen.  She does have a mild French accent, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but it does not distract from the directions.  I recommend watching the ""instructional section"" first, even though it is listed second on the menu.  She tells you what props you need/might want depending on the level that you choose to do, and how to pose your body for each exercise.  I found it useful because I hate having my eyes glued to the screen the first time I do an exercise DVD and my brain not focused on MY movements but instead on the instructor's to see if I'm doing it right.  I also used a yoga mat, an idea I stole from another reviewer, for the floor work.

That said, I was looking to tone back my workouts a bit but still feel like I was actually working out and not just resting and stretching. I find this DVD to be GREAT for increasing strength and tone all over the body (I'm often a bit sore the next day, but the good kind of sore that just lets you know you've used your muscles), but there isn't much cardio. It is definitely a supplemental aspect of my workout, but I find that if I don't do something else during the week (like swimming or jogging), I don't feel like I'm getting my heart rate up enough to be working out effectively. It's also encouraging to see a mom in her 3rd trimester doing the ""hard"" options in the workout - that gives me hope that I won't be the size of a house when I get there (or at least only my stomach will)!

She goes so fast between sections that you barely have time to get a chair and move it back during the amount of time given. There were some great sections, but I found that I didn't want to pull out the DVD just for a few minutes of it.

It helped ease a lot of the lower back pain in the third trimester, and helped a lot with energy. I ended up gaining a healthy 35 pounds, which came off very quickly after the pregnancy. I had a nine pound baby through natural childbirth, and I credit this with helping a lot with stamina, and helping with the muscular strength to push. I found myself thinking back to some of the exercises from this video during labor. I like this better than the yoga, because the transitions seemed smoother, and I got more of a workout.

I think the video is a great sculpting workout!  I can perform all of the advanced exercises in the video pretty easily.  Some of the upper body moves definitely make my arms begin to burn.  I don't feel the leg exercises are much of a challenge, though.  It is definitely not a cardio workout, but that's what I like about it.  I get my cardio in my other workouts.

The good thing about this video is that there is a long and short version,so if you are short on time one day you can do the short version. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1 on the other hand, is an excellent workout video. The warm up and cool down are both relaxing and feel very good. They have a beginners and advanced modification for each exercise. The music is upbeat and will keep you motivated through this workout! The great thing about this video is the workout is extensive enough to attain results but without pushing yourself so hard that you may hurt yourself or your baby. The only thing I didn't like about this video is the background is a dark gymansium.",1287360000,,1104,4.552763819095477
2055751,4,B000227EMI,"Another good workout DVD for pregnancy.  Not as challenging as I thought it was going to be, but maybe as I get farther along (I am in my fifth month now) it will, but I exercised regularly before I got pregnant.",1286755200,,212,4.170731707317073
2055752,3,B000227EMI,"This is not one of my favorite workout videos. I like Autumn Calabrese's 9 Months of Fitness and Lindsay Brin's videos much better. This one is all strength/toning, and some of the exercises feel awkward or like they are not really very effective. I feel like I do not get a great workout when I do this one. I also find the woman's voice in the DVD to be a bit annoying. It is intended to be relaxing I think, but when I workout I don't want to feel relaxed, I want to feel challenged.",1286755200,,486,4.126315789473685

2055754,2,B000227EMI,i was in fairly good shape before pregnancy- worked out about 3x week average intensity at the gym.  but this workout was TOO INTIMIDATING for me while pregnant.  this would be good for a PREGNANT ATHLETE who was in awsome shape pre-pregnancy and needed to keep muscle tone high while pregnant.  i only did one time when i was 16 weeks along and it was too tough for me!,1285632000,,370,4.333333333333333

2055756,4,B000227EMI,"This workout video is different than any videos (prenatal or otherwise) I have used in the past. The music is very relaxing and the workout takes place in what looks to be a softly lit boxing/exercise gym (definitely a gym and not a workout studio). The host, Karyne, doesn't actually speak while exercising. She is very pregnant and performs all the moves with astounding ease. A narrated voice gives exercise commands while she performs them. There is a lot of stretching involved which feels great and the strength training is challenging. There are always 3 levels of each exercise demonstrated (beginner, intermediate, advanced) so you can continue to challenge your body as it get accustomed to a certain movement. The first time I did the video I used all beginner moves, but quickly moved on to the intermediate poses. On a good day, I'll try some of the advanced exercises but haven't completed the entire video in ""advanced"" mode yet. To complete the warm up in anything other than beginner mode, you do need an aerobic step which I haven't yet purchased. Free weights are also needed for the advanced exercises. The atmosphere and energy in this video reminds me more of yoga video than a high energy step aerobic class so it's a nice contrast to other prenatal workouts I own (Denise Austin's Fit & Firm Pregnancy & Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout). I would recommend this video to a friend.",1284768000,2,1403,4.825726141078838
2055757,5,B000227EMI,"I HATE working out! I usually push myself waaay too hard and my exercise-induced asthma doesn't help either. Initially I got this DVD to placate my husband (a personal trainer), but after noticing my butt growing to unimaginable proportions and my scale going off the charts I decided to give it a shot.

The DVD opened up perfectly for me and instructed me to only perform at 70%- I can do that. I also started with the beginner version since I haven't been exercising regularly for quite a few months now. I found the DVD to be quite challenging despite the beginner level, and the day after I felt that wonderful burn you feel after a great workout. I didn't strain too hard and I did what was within my bounds, but still found my heart rate increasing. The workout was challenging, but not overwhelming - it was such an affirming experience.

I especially loved the last exercise called ""Keep Ups"", which are designed to help you mentally prepare for the pain of labor. I kept my arms up for the full 3 minutes, even through teary eyes and sobbing when Karyne instructed me to imagine the joy I'd feel when I finally got to hold my ""bebe"" in my arms. :"")

By the end of this workout I felt accomplished and proud of myself, and I know that I will continue using this workout plan for that reason alone. I can't wait to see how easily my labor goes because of this workout DVD, and how quickly I shed the weight afterward.

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone interested in a safe and easy home workout during pregnancy. Worth every penny!!!!",1284595200,,1547,4.455830388692579

Great exercises - I think I was in better shape pregnant by doing this video than i have been since. Keep in mind she was in Cirque de Soleil so don't worry if she is freakishly more flexible than you are! We did the Bradley classes and every exercise they wanted us to do I was already doing in this video. Can't recommend it enough - my husband even joined in and did it a few times ;-),1282780800,,554,4.045454545454546

2055760,5,B000227EMI,"In short, I loved this video!  That is saying a lot because I have never liked to exersize and would always get bored with any video or routine I started.  I also tried several different prenatal workout videos, but this is the only one I stuck with throughout the entire pregnancy - even up until the day my water broke!  This video was challenging for me as a beginner, but I was still able to enjoy it and feel energized afterward.  I didn't have alot of the aches and pains common with pregnancy and my weight gain was totally appropriate; which I think had alot to do with following this workout so regularly.  My legs and arms are quite toned now thanks to the Perfect Pregnancy Workout.  Some of the things I really like:
-Modifications for beginners and more advanced exersizers.  As I became stronger as my pregnancy progressed, I was able to continue to get a good workout by doing more of the advanced moves.

-A seperate instructional section.  With other videos that have detailed instructions throughout the video, it gets really redundant and annoying after seeing it a few times.  This video shows you detailed instructions in a seperate section, but Karyne is still very careful to remind you to do things safely.

-Many of the moves actually seemed to help prepare me for labor and delivery.  My ab and pelvic muscles were very strong due to this workout.  I have the Mayo Clinic Pregnancy book and I liked that deviations of several recommended preparation moves in that book were in this video.",1281484800,,1514,4.667924528301887

She shows you how to do the workouts at a few different levels, which is really nice for those of us who are a little slower in our pregnancy days, but seeing her (also very pregnant) doing everything 5 steps above is a bit of a morale buster.  If you can deal with that this is a GREAT video.",1281398400,,374,3.973333333333333

If you are up for a challenge and really want to prepare yourself, then do this DVD at least 1 or 2 times a week for a couple of months if you have always been active.  Don't push yourself on this one.  It has a lot of repetitions and can get boring but it is inspiring to watch the lady do it so effortlessly.  I did it for sometime only mostly once a week or so to change things up here and there and I always did the beginners because that is what my gut said.  Good stuff.

It is understood that you will need to consult your doctor before doing it.",1279324800,,728,4.013888888888889

I use it three times a week, and while I really enjoy the workout and the different levels of intensity she demonstrates, I wish they would say at the beginning that you will need a chair, and possibly a step stool and dumb bells. The first few times I was scrambling to get the equipment in the middle of the workout, but now its fine. This video, while a good pregnancy workout, is really low quality and seems to have been shot on someone's high end camcorder at times.

It's structured in such a way that really it has you target all major muscle groups at a quick pace, which gets your heart rate up and allows you to choose which level you do several of the exercises. It gives you lots of options to customize it to your current level & the flexibility of being able to work your way to more advanced variations. It seems to incorporate things from yoga, ballet, & acrobatics- all things to make you strong & fit. Plus, as the end, she has you focus on your breathing & has you connect with your baby... so sweet. I highly recommend this video to pregnant women wanting to stay in good shape. Perfect for hot summer days, where you can stay in the cool A/C & work up a good sweat.",1277683200,,754,4.206896551724138

(There are different variations shown so you can customize it to your own fitness level or to how you feel any given day).  It incorporates elements of cardio, strength, stretching, and endurance.  It also includes Kegel exercises (which are hard for me to remember to do on my own), as well as a mental challenge to prepare you for enduring labor pains.

Like the other reviews say (and she says on the dvd) this is a strength/body shaping workout, so you will want to switch off with a cardio every other day.

2055771,5,B000227EMI,"I purchased this video in preparation for getting pregnant, because I wanted to make sure I had a good strength training workout on hand for when I eventually become pregnant. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! I have only used the video twice, but I really enjoy it so far!

Karyne Steben demonstrates beginner, intermediate and advanced moves for most of the exercises. To do the beginner exercises, you will need a sturdy chair, an exercise mat if your floor is hard, and several pillows. For the intermediate and advanced moves you may want to use a set of light to medium weight hand weights and a step bench or stool. I use 3 pound hand weights and they are perfect for now, but I may use 5 pound weights later on.

After doing this workout I feel as though I have received a very good total body strength workout and am sore in all the right places the next day. This workout is definitely challenging, and the first time through I was sweating a lot. However, the second time I did the workout, some of the more difficult exercises were a little easier for me, but still challenging. I have no doubt that doing this routine 3-4 times per week during pregnancy will be sufficient to maintain and even improve muscle tone. Even if you are not pregnant, the workout is still great, but you will want to do some additional abdominal work on your own most likely, since you won't have to worry about lying flat on your back.

From a stylistic perspective, I found Karyne to be pleasant and the atmosphere of the video to be low-key and not at all annoying.",1275091200,,1564,4.461538461538462

I like the beginner and advanced exercise options. The advanced is really advanced and the beginner is still quite challenging.

There is a separate instructional section, but it is hard to remember the proper form when you are tired from exercise.

2055776,5,B000227EMI,"I know this DVD already has overwhelmingly positive reviews but I can't help but post another happy review!

I am 1 week and 3 days away from my due date but still have the energy to do this workout (not all of it but the ones that I find most beneficial like the pelvic tilt, stretching, squats, kegels)!

I find Karen's accent to be really cute and she varies her exercises and switches to different ones at just the right time to keep your energy up but without exhausting you.

The workout starts with a nice warm up for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs as well as breathing.
Then it goes into ""step up"" exercises to strengthen your buttocks, hips, legs. Squatting is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for pregnant women so there is a great workout that shows you how to challenge yourself as a beginner or intermediate/advanced.

I also like that she incorporates TRICEP exercises into the workout. This will strengthen your arms for all the holding and breastfeeding you'll be doing after Baby arrives! The equipment you need for the workout is minimal - a chair to steady yourself, pillows to prop yourself up. I also use a yoga mat since my hardwood floor starts hurting my knees otherwise.

The only exercise I find too awkward to do for myself is near the end when you're asked to do thigh lifts ... I can't seem to place one foot in front of the other to do this but it's ok ... this gives me time to rest and I do kegels while I wait for that part to be done with.

She's very inspirational and I hope for a healthy and positive labor and delivery thanks to the exercise I've gotten during my 9 months of pregnancy through this DVD! I plan to use it again for subsequent pregnancies! Hopefully the Postnatal DVD is as fun.",1271721600,,1719,4.424050632911392

During the workout itself there is not a lot of instruction: when I have done pilates or yoga before there is a lot ""remember to breathe into your ____, find your center, etc."" This was very ""we're doing this now, get ready, ok go, ok now switch, hurry it up!"" It felt rushed. Just when I would start to feel anything start to burn, she would move on to something else. There were little to no included (and expected!) instructions on what to avoid doing either, i.e. pull in your core, use your legs not your back. During the instruction section she does this, but when you go into a workout a lot of the time you need to be reminded of what to do and what not to do and this didn't happen in this workout. Plus my heart rate didn't go up at ALL, and it definitely did with any other yoga/pilates based workout I've done BEFORE I was pregnant.

It's very short and it's kind of bizarre how it's filmed, etc. The workout itself is OK but for some reason everything about this dvd- production, some of the exercises, the narration, just bugged me!

2055781,5,B000227EMI,"I bought this video about when I was 4 months along. I used it a couple times a week and imediately saw change in my body.

In less than two weeks I was actually so toned I could see muscle definition. PEOPLE BEGAN TO NOTICE HOW GOOD I LOOKED PREGNANT AND TOLD ME SO. I FELT GREAT GETTING INTO MY PREGNANCY BATHING SUIT CAUSE I WAS TONED AND FIT.

CONS:I encourage you to watch the how to part before trying the workout so you can see and understand how to do it. Otherwise you might find it to difficult on yourself and strain your back and other areas pretty easily.
PROS: Quick, you can start simple and work into more advanced stuff as you progress, great results, not stressful. Safe for you and baby all the way until you go into labor.

I really don't like the concept of being pregnant is like being on the thirdage, therefore, the most part of dvd's for pregnant women are full of soft excercises which don't keep the body in full activity and don't call up the muscles to keep working. This is a dvd for women who are and love to be really active in real life and are used to do excercises.

However there are a few things that should be reviewed like: - When you go from one excercise to another, there is not enough time to make the change, the instructions go too fast. - There is no explanation in all excercises about what group of muscles should be working.

I really recommend this dvd for those women who loves to workout.",1268870400,,772,4.280821917808219

2055784,3,B000227EMI,"Well, the first 3 times I did this video, which was the first week, I did feel like I got a good workout from it.  I was an advanced exerciser before this pregnancy However, I hadn't exercised in over a month so I felt out of shape. As my strength increased and my ""muscle memory"" returned this DVD got way too easy.  I added more weight and was doing the advanced positions (most of them) and just didn't feel like I was really getting a good workout.  This was just after the 1st week of doing this DVD.  I quickly switched to something else that would give me a better workout.

I know now why.  You only have one set of each exercise.  After much reading about exercise and what is the most effective type, 2-3 sets is recommended to gain the most strength, important for labor and delivery.  It doesn't matter if you're pregnant, you can continue your same routine during pregnancy just lower the intensity, impact, make a few modications, and take more frequent breaks if necessary.  Not to mention keep well hydrated and cool.

This is my 2nd pregnancy and I have read a couple pregnancy fitness books + I worked with a trainer 2 years ago and I was told some invaluable information.  I know what I'm saying.

This DVD is fine if you're an intermediate, just make sure you listen to your body as I question some of the exercises safety and form.
I think the instructor seems very nice and pleasant, but she is not a trainer and doesn't know proper exercise technique.  She's an acrobat for cirque de soleil.

If you want a decent toning prenatal DVD check out the one by Summer Sanders.  It's the best I have found, not perfect, but best for strength training during pregnancy.",1268092800,5,1684,4.457516339869281

I bought this along with Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout, 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates, and Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, and it is by far the most challenging of the videos.  This video is a good length (about 40 minutes, I think), and has a good warm-up and cool-down stretching section in addition to the meat of the video, which is strength-training.  It has a few moves with adaptations for different fitness levels, which is appreciated for these more difficult moves.

If I had to choose just a couple of videos, I would choose this and Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout.  This is a more difficult workout with just a straight narration of the moves you need to complete - none of the fun banter that Summer Sanders' video has.  It also doesn't have different workouts for different stages of the pregnancy - probably because this instructor is in AMAZING shape.

I'm VERY pregnant right now (39 weeks today) and did it today and it still felt great.  I love that you can make it more or less challenging with the different options she provides.  Yes, the music is a LITTLE cheesy.. but my bigger concern is getting a good workout and not getting bored.. which this video accomplishes!",1267056000,,749,4.601503759398496
2055788,3,B000227EMI,The exercises are great because they show variations for beginner to advanced.  The instructor is slightly soft spoken but that is relaxing.  I definitely felt it in my thighs the next couple of days!,1267056000,,200,4.852941176470588
2055789,5,B000227EMI,"I've done this video twice so far (end of my first trimester) and it has been great.  The next day after the first workout, I felt the ""good soreness"" that lets you know you've worked your muscles properly - all without picking up any weights!  I plan to alternate this with a prenatal yoga video for relaxing/stretching.

The video was challenging, but not over the top.  I feel like every time I got to a point where I didn't think I could take it anymore, I would start to hear the countdown on the repetitions letting me know there were only 5 more in the set.  Some reviews have complained about the ""fluidity"" of the exercises, but the quick movement from one exercise to the next adds a slight bit of ""cardio"", well, at the least it keeps your heart pumping.  I was sweating bullets by the end of the DVD.

I guess if you are someone that needs ""outside motivation"" and aesthetics, perhaps this video is not for you.  But if you are looking for a good, focused, strength-based DVD, this is the one for you!

Oh, and the cupie (sp?) exercises at the end...OH MY GOODNESS!  It will have your shoulders looking toned and ready to pick up your baby in no time!",1266796800,,1163,4.367441860465116

Before I got pregnant I worked out intensely, so I was looking for something that was going to be challenging to me but safe for my whole pregnancy.  The video was challenging from the start and has remained so thus far (it gets more challenging as I get bigger, but not unbearable).  It has helped me stay toned and feeling strong and empowered throughout all of the crazy changes to my body.

I got that great after-workout soreness that's lets you know you've done something good for your body, but never felt overwhelmed or that I might be doing something risky for my child.  There is also an instructional selection that explains each move and its benefits.  The only suggestion is that they should place the instructional selection first on the menu, and not second.  I watched the video in order, and wished I had watched the instructional portion first.  I love that it also incorporates kegels during the workout, which I hate to do on my own, but was great when incorporated along with the other exercises.

The movements are interesting, the pace is varied, the music and the narration doesn't seem repetitive, and I find myself looking forward to doing the routine again on the following day.

The intensity of the work out is adaptable, and you really feel like you got a good all-around workout after the 40 minutes.  The warm-up and the cool-down aren't too long nor too short, and you feel stronger and more balanced after just one week of following the video (four times per week).

I liked how she includes a ""beginner"" and an ""advanced"" modification for most of the exercises and her narrative prompts are very helpful for making sure you are positioned right. The only thing that would make it ""perfect"" for me is if she broke the workout into different chapter segments. I don't usually feel like doing a 45 minute workout after a full day of work, so I would do one half the first day, and the second half the next day. I also really dislike the background music; it reminds me of the music in an old-school Nintendo game. Overall, I strongly recommend this video.",1262736000,,764,4.503597122302159

I really liked the different levels of difficulty for each exercise.  I started out by doing mostly the beginner exercises, but I think I will be able to do the advanced ones after a few more times of working out. There is no way I will be able to do this every day until I get more used to it.  I am just too sore, but I like that I feel more energized and healthy after 1 exercise.

Karen starts with a short stretch and warm up.  She then moves on to a 30 minute medium intensity workout that includes strength training.  I love how she isolates each muscle group in the circuit.  I really feel like I'm getting a total body workout.  What's great about this dvd is that for many activities she has a beginner, intermediate and advanced position so you can try another level as you progress.
The dvd has a great ""keep up"" exercise which is as mental as it is physical.  It's great to get you to focus your  mind elsewhere as your body starts to feel strained or tired.  After the ""keep up"", you cool down with some great stretching.
This is a great dvd for any expectant mother regardless of pre-pregnancy fitness level.  I highly recommend it.",1261353600,2,1036,4.581521739130435

I do not have a lot of space in front of the TV in my house and the work out in this DVD requires you to use certain household items (like a chair) to aid in the workout. It might actually be very good but it didn't work out for me. I stuck to doing the prenatal yoga and walking for my pregnancy fitness.,1260144000,,457,3.7216494845360826

I definitely felt, and still feel, like I'm getting a good workout from this DVD without feeling like I've overdone it. I breathe a little harder during the workout, and afterwards my muscles feel like they got something done that day. I also like how much emphasis there is on legs and arms, and she even works Kegels into the routine. And I like knowing that if it gets too easy, I have the intermediate and advanced levels to try next.

2055813,5,B000227EMI,"I purchased this DVD based on a random mention of it on some pregnancy website and later on the positive reviews I read here on Amazon.  It was a great buy!  I really liked the ""French lady"" (that's what I call her) instructor.  Her voice is very soothing and sweet and she has a slight French accent.  The workout is pretty rigorous too.  I like the flow of the exercises, the transitions between each one, the music, and how she gives you the option to do beginner or advanced moves for most exercises.  She doesn't stop to show you instructions between each move which is great because this gets annoying and your workout becomes so stop-and-start if you've done the video more than a few times.  There's just an easy flow from one exercise to the next. Just watch the intro the first time you do it so you are aware of some tips she has for the exercises.  From then you can just do the exercise sequence as presented.  I also liked that she does her right sided exercises on her left side, so you can actually mirror the moves when she does them.

I really enjoyed exercising along with her and I particularly like how she says to ""picture your baby in your arms"" when you're doing the pick up exercise at the end of the tape -- you want to give up because your arms hurt, but imagining the baby in your arms helps me get through to the end.",1258416000,,1346,4.284584980237154

Also, I actually do not own a regular chair in my house (we have benches at the dining room table) so I have to make do with a coffee table and bar stool, but you should have one handy.

I still went to the sculpting class, but I felt like I was wasting my $50 monthly membership for one class per week. So I got this video and I love it. It's like attending a class at the gym w/o worrying about always having to modify everything. It's hard enough that I feel like I am getting a great workout, but I know all the exercises are safe.

I basically stopped working out when I was 6 months pregnant with my first baby and am now almost 4 months pregnant with our second baby. Though I'm still in OK shape, I wanted to feel stronger and healthier so I tried different exercises. Though walking is a nice past-time, it's not a workout for me. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout is perfect for me because:
1) it's low-impact and standard exercises are modified so it feels safe for my baby while it's easy to follow  2) it's fast-paced so I don't get bored and can be done before my daughter's up from her nap
3) some days are more challenging than others so there's room to improve
4) it works every muscle in the body-you exhaust one muscle group then move on to exhaust another

My only suggestions are:
1)I've been exercising a long time, but a beginner may want to talk to a doctor before starting this routine (just as the DVD reccommends). Just take it slow and know that you have 9 long months to do more and more of the video.
2)I only do it 2 times a week (3 if I can squeeze it in) and that's enough for me.
3)I also do extra stetching at the end. Her cool-down session doesn't allow for a thorough enough strech for me so I'm very sore the next day if I don't stretch for longer.",1255046400,,1358,4.219230769230769

2055822,5,B000227EMI,"Here's a comparison of 2 fantastic videos: ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" with Karyne Steben and ""Prenatal Yoga"" with Shiva Rea.

""Prenatal Yoga"": Soothing, gentle stretches. Shiva Rea's voice is gentle and relaxing. A wonderful time to focus on the baby inside you as you breath, stretch and become aware of your body. Not physically demanding (good for days when pregnancy hormones have a person feeling crummy and tired). Has modifications for all 3 trimesters. I feel relaxed physically and emotionally after doing stretches.

""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"": A good workout for arms, legs and torso. It's a relief to know I am doing exercises that are safe for a low-risk pregnancy. I would guess the beginner's level on this video is more like an intermediate aerobics videos. After 3 months of inactive nausea, I use the pause button for breathers. There is also an advanced modification shown for a more intense workout. I just love how Karyne is sporting a beautiful, bare, pregnant tummy. Seeing a kick-ass fit pregnant woman who obviously is comfortable with her full-rounded tummy is inspiring. No frills on sets or music, this is all about the exercise.

Thanks to everyone for your helpful comments on Amazon. I always check what you say before I pull out the credit card. Here's to a wonderful pregnancy!",1254873600,,1320,5.018264840182648
2055823,5,B000227EMI,"This has been my go-to workout video during pregnancy.  It's challenging-but-doable, well-sequenced, and features clear demonstrations of correct alignment and timing by the instructor.  The one thing I would say is, as someone who has a prior shoulder injury, I find the Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1 can be too much for the injured joint -- if I try to do everything exactly as it's shown.  Karyne Steben is a trapeze artist, so it makes sense she would focus a lot on upper-body strength and the shoulders in particular.  But, for home practitioners, I'd say -- don't just try to do everything she does without checking in with your own body...this _is_ a very intensive sequence for arms and shoulders in particular, so be careful and take breathers if necessary.  I'm pretty strong, but I don't do all of the tricep-dips she does; it makes my old injury start to hurt, and I don't wanna go back there!  But, otherwise, this is a really great video, and if you _can_ do everything Karyne does, more power to you.  I'm jealous.",1254182400,,1033,4.705555555555556

My whole life I have been naturally toned in the arm and abs area, so I never had to do much but aerobics to stay in shape. So once I got pregnant, I got a bit scared. I gained a few pounds and freaked out a little. I know it's because of the baby, but with my being small my whole life, it's a bit to mentally get ready for.

I wanted a program that would work me over and challenge me. I wanted to sweat and feel like I had done something. This program is it. I just finished it and I can feel the tightness in my arms from the weights work as I type on the keyboard! It is a total body conditioning/toning video. There are even parts that get your heart rate up and you're not even doing any jumping around! I agree with the last comment -- this def goes in the ""favorites"" rotation.

I also like that she gives you beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of each move. So you can ramp it up or slow it down as you see fit. Sometimes I will move between the three stages to vary the program each time. She emphasizes getting the arms strong to hold the baby so there is work with weights, and the thigh and butt area, including kegels (which she assumes you know how to ""contract"" already). Includes warm up and cool down.

I feel very comfortable that this program is working me out to get me strong for the baby now, that it will keep me strong while having the baby and that it will definitely give my body some muscle memory for after the delivery. Great video!",1252713600,,1566,4.161716171617162

I could this with using my stair stepper also 3 days a week. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have the perfect workout routine while they are pregnant.",1252454400,,672,4.137404580152672
2055830,5,B000227EMI,"Now being 8 months pregnant and having done this workout dvd for at least 5 months and 1-2 times per week, I can honestly say it's a great workout. Even in the beginning the exercises were strenuous enough to make you feel like you did something. And even now, at 8 months, it's still excellent, without making you feel you overdo it. Thanks to the good warm-up and cool-down, I have never felt sore the next day, just energized and in better shape.
After doing this video for so many times, I am still not bored with it.
The instructor gives tips, instructions, and reminders at just the right time, without becoming annoying. The music is very modern and upbeat, but again just fine.
I highly recommend it!",1251936000,,708,4.5390625

Now I'm 5 months pregnant I still do it and always feel invigorated after.  She is clear, concise, and I don't feel like I'm overdoing it, which is REALLY important to me for the safety of my baby.

2055832,3,B000227EMI,"I bought three pregnancy workouts: 1. Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout 2. Leisa Hart's Fit Mama 3. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1.

I have done all three and by far my favorite is Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout. It offers about 20 minutes of cardio, 15 mins of weight training, 5 min cooldown, and a relaxation/lamaze section. Of the three dvds it's the only one that really raised my heart rate and got me sweating a little bit, so I actually felt like I got a decent workout.

The Perfect Pregnancy Workout is a good dvd if you just want to do weight training. I love cardio and I love to sweat, so this one didn't do it for me. On days when I am feeling a little low on energy, it may be good to do, but I know it won't be on my regular rotation.",1251763200,,752,4.1438356164383565

This is a good workout DVD.  You will want to go through the instructional information at least once.  It only took me once and I was off to the races.  The DVD has three levels of workout.  Yes, some of the advanced is pretty hard.  I'm not sure I could do it not pregnant.  But the beginner and intermediate are pretty easy.

This workout doesn't actually get my heartrate up too much at all (less than the Erin O'Brien DVD), but I like the different exercises that it has on it.  The music is better than the Erin O'Brien DVD, but I kinda tune music out anyway.",1250208000,,817,4.344370860927152

I was really tired and a little shaky when I finished the first time, but then within a couple of hours I got a huge energy surge.

The other reviews complained of the scenery and not enough explanation - that's the beauty of working out at home you can pause and rewind! I spend most of my time looking away from the TV because she tells you the next move before you have finished the current one so you can be ready for the change.

My posture and breathing improves dramatically for hours after doing this video. My only suggestion is to not do the workout too late in the day, because the energy surge makes it hard to go to sleep. :)

I have recommended this to many women. I love it!",1249603200,,891,4.223529411764706

I felt like I had a challenging workout when I used the Advanced level and towards the last few weeks of pregnancy still felt challenged using the Beginner level.
I even used this weeks after having the baby and was proud that I could still make it through the entire DVD, even though it was only the Beginner level.
Overall, I highly suggest this DVD.",1249257600,,529,4.377551020408164

I don't mind at all that Karyne doesn't directly talk to me, but yet it is her speaking as a voice over.  I thought the music was fine and I could care less about the background.  The workout itself is pretty tough, especially if you are a beginner.  She does have different levels that show up in boxes on the screen, so if you want to do advanced moves you can.  After my first attempt at this workout it left my whole body sore, which is good.  I doubt that by doing this workout I would look anything like Karyne, but it's a good start.  I used this dvd workout in combination with Pilates During Pregnancy, VOL 1. (Which really works the outer thigh area).",1248048000,,781,4.236486486486487

The video is excellent, it is a workout and I can feel my heart rate up!  I only have one complaint, for me I feel that she moves kind of fast when she is changing exercises.  If you need to move a chair or position, you better hurry.  I have no problem following her but I have had to hit rewind several times.  I am sure that this will change when I get more fit but it's not like I am obese (12 wks. tomorrow and we are so blessed!)

The DVD offers several different levels with the video changing so you can see each one with each exercise. It's not too hippy-dippy but not boot camp either.

Having said that, one could still manage to keep up with modifications that are well instructed in this DVD. The setting and the music is a little drab but the constant introduction of moves will keep you going and your heart pumping. Definitely a great total body workout DVD during and after pregnancy, but it's not for the novice exerciser.",1246233600,,568,4.69

2055843,4,B000227EMI,"I have only done this workout twice but I really like it. In fact I think the format is the best for any workout video. The way they treat it makes a lot of sense to me.

Most videos are shot with your first time in mind so everytime you watch it you have to go through the 'now get your chair, now get your this,' and that just gets old. This one has a preview section where you watch it your first time and for later reviews. The review shows you all equipment you need and describes the moves with commentary. Then you go to the chapter with the workout and you never have to hear about that stuff again during your real workout.

It's a decent workout too. I have been going to the gym pretty religiously during the end of 1st trimester and all of 2nd trimester when I got this DVD. I don't do the abs even though they are modified - I'm just not that confident about it.

The instructor has a mild accent - French native speaker I believe - but it does not get in the way. I had to keep reminding myself that she is a professional acrobat and not to be terribly concerned that I did not look like her! ;0",1244764800,,1109,4.031818181818182

2055846,5,B000227EMI,"This is a great video - highly recommended. Each exercise flows easily into the next without a lot of transition time, so by the end my heart rate is a bit elevated. Karyne is sweet and inspirational (she's very pregnant, yet SO strong and healthy). The number of repetitions is perfect: challenging, but not impossible; and once the beginner version becomes too easy, there are several intermediate and/or advanced options to increase the challenge.

You will notice an emphasis on arm and upper back strength. This will be SO beneficial when you come home with a new baby, particularly if you plan to breastfeed. With our first son, my back ached and spasmed for the first couple weeks until I built up strength from holding him. If you faithfully do this video, you will already be strong!

I also love how she includes Kegel exercises, labor quats, and the ""keep up"" exercise which all prepare for the delivery.

MUST BUY and PRACTICE THIS EXERCISE PROGRAM!!! :)",1244073600,,966,4.807228915662651

2055849,5,B000227EMI,"This is my second pregnancy and I was as determined to stay in shape this time around as much as the first.  But with a toddler who won't sit in a jogging stroller, it was proving to be difficult finding a routine that would work.  I had purchased Leisa Hart's FitMama the first time around and it was not very challenging for me so it collected dust in the corner, until I was 8 1/2 months pregnant and needed just a little movement (I actually went into labor after doing it at 39 weeks).  I'm a marathon runner and triathlete, so I like to keep the intensity up.  The Perfect Pregnancy Workout has hit the spot and has been the perfect at home workout.  Not only does it get your heart rate up, but it's the only DVD I've found that uses weights and concentrates on maintaining muscle strength.  I also love the ways she incorporates kegal exercises into the moves.  I do this workout along with a 30 minute run/walk (depends how I'm feeling), and I have been feeling great.  I'm currently 20 weeks along and feel that I'll be able to do this workout all the way to the end.  She does have ""beginner"" and ""advanced"" options with the workout, that could be used as ""really pregnant"" and ""pregnant"" guidelines :).
I wouldn't recommend this workout for someone just starting an exercise routine; it may be a little discouraging.  I'm also using Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix, which is a nice change up.  Good luck to all the expecting Mama's!",1243468800,,1448,4.488549618320611

This video is great.  As someone who has been exercising, it's nice to have a prenatal video that is comfortably challenging. While the average gal is not going to be in the same shape as a Cirque De Soleil performer ( I do not strive to have ab definition in my third trimester), it offers beginner, intermediate and advanced options to accomodate most levels of fitness.  While not cardio intense, I do feel my heart rate comfortably rise and feel like I've gotten a solid safe workout when I am done...just what the doctor ordered!

One personal down note - the scripted reading and french accent start to bug me, but I'm in it for the fitness...not the acting.

This work out was not easy for me the 1st time.  Even at 8 weeks.  However, because a woman who was obviously VERY pregnant was kicking my butt I was challanged and that was a great thing!!!

While it is not going to raise your heart dramatically it will give you a good overall workout.  You will need a step, a chair, pillows (or I use a partially inflated exercise ball), and some hand weights though to perform all of the exercises.  You are given options for beginner, intermediate, and advanced which is nice.  The slight french accent is mildly annoying at times but is not a deal breaker by any means.  Music could be better too but again not a deal breaker.  I would recommend this dvd for a good prenatal workout.",1238025600,,719,4.492307692307692

I'm one of those people who really hate exercise, but since pregnant I decided to try a few videos to keep in shape at home.  This will definitely be one I do every week.

The workout moves themselves are easy to do, and the video shows beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels in an easy-to-follow way. (I did beginner throughout, and still got a terrific workout.)  I definitely recommend watching the instructional portion first, because there is very little if any explanation of the moves during the workout itself.  There is also not a lot of time between moves to get yourself properly positioned, so the first time I did the video I found myself having to pause it while I figured out where my legs/arms were supposed to go.

It's more about strength training than cardio, so makes a good complement to walking/swimming/whatever else you do.  The things I don't like about it are: it isn't broken down into sections, so you have to do the whole 45 minute workout or nothing (or switch off in the middle, which I often do).  If you don't have much time, and/or have another kid or kids who may wake up while you're trying to work-out, then it's much better to have a dvd that is in shorter sections (like Leeza Hardt).  Also, it is really depressing to look at.  The setting is this bleak basement-like warehouse, and it's dark; it's somehow a real downer.  If I have to watch somebody doing exercises on TV, I'd rather have some mountains or ocean in the background.  But that may be just me.

It does get the heartrate up--safely--but it's really about sculpting and staying toned in all the right places.  I do this video as well as cardio such as walking and the elliptical.  For a totally out of shape person, this workout would be hard but you have to start somewhere, and you could do fewer reps.  For someone just looking to stay toned, it's great, and if you were super fit before pregnancy, this is also excellent because you can follow the ""advanced"" level.",1236211200,,765,4.637037037037037

This video was fantastic - it is SO different than most of the others out there - the music, the stagecraft, and Karyne's gentle voice are quite a contrast to the bouncy, bubbly cheerleading instructor voices that just grate on your nerves.  I appreciated the focus on building core strength, the integration of Kegel's into the routine (which, despite my best intentions, I rarely found myself doing any other time throughout the day), and the workout flow, which covered arms, legs, and belly, in addition to back and overall balance.

2055876,3,B000227EMI,"I bought this workout DVD based on the reviews that I read on Amazon. I can say that it's a descent workout and good for strength training, definitely no cardio involved though. The pros are that it has an instructional section so Karyne explains all of the moves first and the proper way to do them that way when you get to the workout, you can go straight through the workout without stopping to get instruction. Also, I have noticed some improvement in my muscle tone. It's more of a ""yoga"" type of workout. She also includes lots of kegels which are so important during pregnancy!
The cons: the music is terrible for starters. You can tell that Karyne has not been an exercise instructor (this is difficult to explain but she will say ""last time"" and mean last time but sometimes mean one more time which gets confusing if you are used to working out in an aerobic class and going from move to move. You actually have to watch what she is doing rather than listening for instruction). Although I'm not an instructor myself, I'm pretty sure that some of the moves aren't properly done. For example, in every workout class I've ever been in, when doing a squat or lunge, you never extend your knee over your toes but she specifically says to do that during the labor squats and during another move (I can't remember). Also, being very pregnant (and clumsy) myself, I can say that I'm not comfortable doing push ups or being in any position where I could possibly slip and fall on my big belly. Further, if you aren't used to doing pushups, it's not easy with an additional 30 lbs. added to your regular weight!
Overall, I wouldn't suggest buying this dvd unless you are into arabic music and yoga/strength training with ""okay"" instruction. It's definitely not worth $18.",1234396800,,1772,4.593059936908517
2055877,5,B000227EMI,"I've only done this once, but I think it's great. The strengthening and endurance combo is fluid, keeps my attention, and is definitely capable of helping women stay fit and prepared for labor. I need to buy some hand-weights (5 lbs should be fine). I like that it doesn't take long, but you feel like you've definitely had a workout. I sweated and was sore for 2 days. I would like to do this twice a week for the rest of my pregnancy. It's nice that you can do it at night when exercising outside (my preferred venue) is not a good option. Karyn is charming and inspirational. Next time I will do this on a yoga mat rather than carpet.",1234137600,,637,4.2727272727272725

I'm in decent shape, but I can't get through the whole DVD in one day. Others have mentioned this, too, but I don't see it as a problem. I do the beginning up to the floor work one day, and the floor work and cool down the next day. If I'd started earlier in my pregnancy, I'd probably try to work up to doing the whole thing in one day, but at 30 weeks I don't see that happening. For many of the exercises, she gives advanced and sometimes intermediate versions to go along with the ""beginner"" version. I find the beginner to be plenty for most of them, though. I'm thrilled I bought this DVD so I can get some exercise when the sidewalks are too icy to go for a walk.",1233446400,,782,4.084415584415584

It's set at a great pace and only uses 2 hand free weights, a chair or something to help with balance, and 2 bed pillows, so you aren't scrambling to change equpiment.  The background music isn't really annoying like some other videos and it constantly shows how to modify ALL the exercises for beginner, intermediate, or advanced.  It works all areas:  legs, butt, arms, shoulders, chest, abs, back and even your pelvic floor.  It doesn't seem to drone on forever and it's actually fun!  But you WILL feel it the next day!

This workout demands an incredible amount of strength, as well as balance, something that very few pregnant people manage to maintain throughout their entire pregnancy. I am 26 weeks pregnant and cannot maintain the balance for half of the exercises. I guess I was looking for something a little more aerobic, and less muscle building.

Kudos to anyone who can do this entire lengthy workout pregnant! I'm sure I could do it if I wasn't pregnant, but pregnant? No way! I have easier workout videos that aren't for pregnant people that I think I'll stick with.

I'm so surprised that this video received such positive feedback, it's the only reason I bought it, and I really wish I had saved the $20...",1231891200,6,856,4.5519480519480515

I picked this video after reading many reviews and was very happy with my decision. The thing I like the most about the video is sometimes she shows different moves for beginner, intermediate, and advanced. This lets me use the video throughout the entire pregnancy and also allows me to choose how hard I work on a given basis based on how I feel. This is not a fluffy workout video. Her moves are challenging and I actually feel like I worked out when I am finished.",1231372800,,584,4.223214285714286
2055888,4,B000227EMI,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a semi-vigorous workout during my pregnancy. Thru my first pregnancy and so far thru the second trimester of this one I have continued to work out regularly (at a lower intensity than usual of course), but I still run, do spinning classes, do Yoga, etc. (a lot slower than usual) but I'm still quite active (even with 20lbs extra).
Unfortunately taking care of a 2 year old doesn't give me a lot of free time so I decided to try this DVD so I could exercise at home while my son sleeps.
I though this DVD would give me a good workout, and that it would be a bit more difficult than most Pregnancy DVDs, but it really wasn't.

I've never consider myself to be a super athlete, I just work out regularly 4 times/week. So I was a little disappointed with this DVD.

I gave it 4 stars because it has really good information about working out during pregnancy and overall is a decent workout, but if you are in decent shape, continue to do the things you normally do, you may use this DVD for more information and as a complement to your regimen, but don't think of it as the only workout that is going to keep you in shape thru all of your pregnancy.",1231286400,,1181,4.2444444444444445

2055890,5,B000227EMI,I love this workout. It is challenging but not too challenging. Most prenatal workouts are way too easy and treat us like we are handicapped and out of shape.  We are only pregnant! This workout is safe and still gives you a decent workout.,1230249600,,240,4.454545454545454

Im not over weight at all but haven't worked out regularly and this work out is just right to get me back on track.  Some people said that they feel like they are changing from prop to prop but what I did was set up 3 stations before I start, a few feet from each other so as we change props I just take two steps to my next area.  It works out perfect.  Before you know it your done with you workout and I always feel great knowing I finished and am doing something thats great for my Baby.

My only complaint is that a couple of the ""advanced"" exercises (especially the push up) I probably wouldn't do if I wasn't pregnant.

2055894,5,B000227EMI,I absolutely loved this DVD. I was in pretty good shape pre-pregnancy and in general have been doing the intermediate level of her exercises from month 3 until almost the very end. I often felt the fatigue in my thighs and gluts the next day so they really work the muscles. I also walked for up to an hour every other day. I'm sure a lot of factors contributed but I think at least in part due my being in good shape I got through labor quickly and have returned to good form quickly.,1229472000,2,485,4.170212765957447

If you only did the warm up section, I promise you, you will be happy.  The workout itself is tough!  DO NOT TRY TO complete the workout on your first try b/c, like I said, it's tough.  Do as much as u can and stop when u need to... In time, i'm sure you (and I) will be able to complete the workout, no problem.

the only issue with the DVD is the lack of verbal instruction during the workout.  If you aren't constantly watching the monitor, you will fall behind - at least, I did. But the instructor seems very sweet and IN GREAT SHAPE, which works as motivation to keep up.",1229040000,,739,4.169014084507042
2055897,5,B000227EMI,"I ordered this a few weeks ago and only got around to trying it today, but wish I had started it months ago. I loved the instructor, she's very encouraging without being too perky and smiley. She tells you a few seconds ahead what the next exercise will be, so even on my first try I caught on quickly and didn't have to spend all my time watching the screen. I would say I'm in average shape, although I've been a real couch potato for the last few months, and this was challenging without being overwhelming.

I also like that she includes kegels, squats and some light ab work - it makes me feel like I'm preparing for labor as opposed to just a regular strengthening workout. I'm six months pregnant right now so hopefully a few more months of this will have me ready to go!

Even though I worked up a sweat, I felt really good and not at all tired when I was done. The baby seemed to like it too, he slept through even the most strenuous parts but work up during the cooldown and has been kicking ever since.",1228780800,,1013,4.216494845360825

Like most people I konw, I have not done step aerobics since the 90's and don't care to start up with it again. Following the step aerobics are various exercises using chairs, weights, floor, etc. follow in a disorganized fashion. I have the Pilates during Pregnancy video by Niece Pecenka which works the same muscles, but is of better quality and offers a much better workout in my opinion.",1228348800,3,671,4.911504424778761

I have not had extreme morning sickness, but I certainly haven't been feeling like myself. Before I became pregnant I would classify myself as an intermediate in workouts, I typically do calisthenics and pilates at home on dvd. While pregnant I find I am tired and much less motivated to work out. So these videos have been great at just getting me up and moving, stretching and giving me a boost of energy. As some women mentioned, her voice is dubbed over the video, which I think works very well. There is no huffing and puffing or change in clarity. I find her accent charming and her tone soothing. The Kegel exercises are a real bonus, I'm not sure how many others focus on this, but it's something I think about as I get later into pregnancy and worry about sneezing or laughing too hard!

The first one was The Complete Pregnancy with Erin O'Brien.  I really enjoyed this video.  At times it got my heart rate up and my legs were even a little sore the next day.  I wish it would have had a little more upper body work and stretching but overall it gave me a good workout.  I would recommend this video.  I will continue to do it.

The next video I did was The Perfect Pregnancy Workout With Karyne Steben and it was absolutley the worst video I have ever done and believe me I have done my fair share of workout videos.  Everything was so random in it.  There was no flow of exercises.  One minute I am using a bench, then I am using a chair, then I get weights, then I am on the chair again changing its position, then I am on the floor, and then I am standing with weights again.  I felt like I was just jumping from one thing to another.  I probably got more exercise moving equipment than I did doing the video.  It feels like the last five minutes of the video I am doing arm circles with the weirdest music playing. My heart rate never got up and I don't feel like I even worked my muscles.  Besides all that her voice is recorded.  I was very disappointed with this video after all the great reviews I saw.  I am now going to have to order another one because this video will not cut it.

My knee is back to feeling somewhat normal and I want to exercise again so I decided to invest in this dvd. I really enjoy this workout, but it isn't too taxing. That is a good thing being pregnant but I think if you are in GOOD shape to start with maybe you are better off reading about fitness while pregnant and modifying your current workout.

Upon trying out this DVD I was a bit disappointed. It's not that I found the workout to be unsafe, or not contain anything it claimed to. I simply find this workout cheesy and boring.

I hate Karyne's accent and the video's music. Usually, those kind of things in a exercise DVD don't even bother me! Neither is cute or interesting in the least. The background is extremely dark and detracted from the atmosphere and the mood. The movements are repetitious, and remind me of being back in school gym class. I expected some innovative movements from the reviews, but it's all based on all those old boring strengthening techniques that are designed to bulk you up quickly. To top it all off I couldn't finish the workout because I grew so tired and dizzy at the pace that I collapsed on the floor half falling asleep because it was so draining...before I woke up 15 minutes later enough to drag myself to bed and black-out...i mean...sleep for a few hours.

If you prefer exercise routines that involve yoga, pilates, lotte berk technique, or callanetics then this DVD is probably not for you.

If you are more of the type of person who likes going to the gym and using the machines, or taking an aerobics class then this may be more up your alley.

On a final note, if you still plan on purchasing this DVD please take my advice and take it easy. Don't try to do too much too quickly.

She includes Kegel exercises within the workout, which is fantastic.  (You can watch the informational section to find out exactly how to do these.)  It's encouraging that she is very pregnant in the video and is still doing everything right along with you.  Best of all, unlike most exercise videos where the annoyingly perky instructor gives you a pep-talk through the whole thing and it just makes you want to mute your tv, her voice narrates it in an encouraging and straight-forward way.

I bought this DVD together with vol 2, hoping to be very challenged. But other than the push-ups, the rest are very doable at the advanced level. The workout focused a lot on arm toning, which is good, but I don't really understand how that is important in a pregnancy. She explained what kegel is! I am sure many people knew what it is, but I didn't. The background is plain but not distracting. Not a fan of the music either since I like to be zen and prefer to stretch in soothing music. But all these are personal preferences. I think the instructor's attitude is sweet and unpretentious and I actually like her accent.

I started this in my 6th month and it was doable but I definitely had to stick with the beginner level, even though I have stayed active.  I wish I had started in my first trimester to keep up muscle tone but I feel comfortable doing it later in pregnancy.  Just listen to your body.",1221609600,,488,4.511363636363637
2055918,2,B000227EMI,"I consider myself to have a reasonable level of fitness and flexibility. I purchased this DVD based on the positive reviews posted on Amazon but I was disappointed and concerned when I tried the workout myself.
Some of the exercises seemed unsafe especially the abdominal crunches, lunges, squats & push-ups (even the modified versions) when you consider the hypermobility of joints and centre of gravity changes in pregnancy.
The instructor doesn't appear to grasp the concept that not every woman was a superfit trapeze artist prior to pregnancy.  From what I can tell she does not have any formal qualifications in prenatal fitness, but rather developed this exercise program based on her own needs and level of fitness.  On the positive the warm-up it very good.
Erin O'Brien's Pregnancy Fitness Fix (for more experienced exercisers) or Leisa Hart's FitMama (more moderate intensity) appeared to be safer but still higly effective options.",1220227200,3,943,5.23841059602649

It really gives you a good workout that seems to work most if not every muscle in your body.  I highly recommend it and can already tell that in juat a few weeks of using this dvd along with Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea and Prenatal Fitness Fix with Erin O'Brien that I'm firming up.  I'm feeling much better and more energized too!",1219795200,,475,4.130434782608695

2055921,5,B000227EMI,"This is my third pregnancy, and I've bought a different workout video for each one. I finally found one that is not cheesy, not too hard or intimidating, and not too vague in directions.  It is very straight forward and easy to follow, yet it challenges you appropriately. My sister and my mother-in-law (neither of who are pregnant) have done this workout with me and complained about how sore they were the next day! They thought it was great. I normally give up on videos after doing them a couple of times, but I always look forward to doing this one and I always feel great about myself afterwards. She gives a very good intro speech about how to do the exercises the correct way, how to tell if your stomach muscles have separated and how to modify if they have, etc. Even when I don't feel like doing it, I am still compelled to start the video just because I want to watch her! She is amazingly fit! She wears this little spandex outfit that proudly displays her belly and she just looks so good! Also she is not bubbly, loud or annoying like some video instructors are. She is very soothing and positive in a very non-annoying way. I will probably continue to use this video even after I have my baby!",1218153600,,1210,4.401785714285714
2055922,5,B000227EMI,I haven't worked out in a few months and this was a great way to get back on track.  She shows you variations for different levels for all the exercises.

2055923,5,B000227EMI,"This is my first pregnancy and I'm currently in my second trimester.  I like that these exercises are Dr approved and these exercises have been modified for pregnant women, but that they don't treat us like such ""delicate flowers"".  I'm not a gym rat, but I did enjoy keeping active before getting pregnant (walking hills, jogging, hiking, pilates, yoga, strength training).These exercises are hard enough that I feel like I'm getting an actual workout.  I also like that Karyne usually presents 2 versions of the exercise so that you can do the beginner or intermediate version based on your fitness level.  I definitely plan on getting as much exercise as possible while I still feel up to it.  We'll see how I feel about exercise in the 3rd trimester - it might just be yoga and walking at that point.  :)",1217203200,,808,4.695035460992908
2055924,4,B000227EMI,"If I could give this workout video 3 1/2 stars, I would.  The video definitely will make you sweat, but some of the exercises made me a little bit nervous.  I consider myself a somewhat advanced exerciser -- prior to my pregnancy, I regularly went to the gym and lifted weights, ran anywhere from 3-9 miles on the treadmill and did strength training classes -- but I was afraid to do some of the exercises in this video as demonstrated for the advanced exerciser, as they seemed a little bit dangerous for joints (specifically the lunges and deep squats).  Some of the exercises were also a little bit different from what I am used to (less traditional), and when I did these exercises, I wasn't 100% sure what muscles they were supposed to be working.  However, on a positive note, this video made me sweat, it has a great abdominals sections and the arm exercises are very good.  Please keep in mind that if you want to do the ""advanced"" or ""intermediate"" versions of the exercises, you will need 3-5 pound weights and a small step (for the ""step ups"").

I also purchased the Prenatal Fitness Fix video by Erin O'Brien, and I liked that video better. The movements were easier to do, and the instruction was better (instructor focused a lot on what muscle groups were being worked).",1216598400,2,1284,4.585152838427947

She doesn't really tell you what is going on next or what props you will need she just starts doing them, that is very frustrating when you haven't done this video many times. I have tried many work out videos before but this is my first pregnancy video. Hopefully I will try more because I am not very satisfied with this one.

2055928,5,B000227EMI,"I bought this video about 6 weeks ago. I use it anywhere between 2 to 3 times a week (on my off days I go to the gym and do some vigourous walking on the treadmill, squats and some upper body work). I am currently 28 weeks pregnant.  I have to say that this video is definitely challenging. I love the fact that she gives you the option to do beginner, intermediate and advanced exercises.  I also love the fact that there is some actual cardio component to the workout, as I have found some of the other prenatal videos skip that. I also feel that the exercises themselves are very safe and I feel very grounded when doing them. Nothing seems to extreme to me or compromising, and if one does feel a little off kilter doing a particular exercise there are modifications available (for instance, if the advanced version of the step up is too challenging, then you can modify and do the intermediate or beginner level).

I have definitely noticed an improvement in my ability to do some of the exercises and have watched myself advance from the beginner level to the intermediate or advanced levels in some of the exercises.  The first time I did the video I had to stop it a few times along the way to give myself a bit of a break. So, yeah, it can be tough at first glance and fairly intimidating. But I encourage you to not give up...if you can't do the full number of repetitions, do as many as you can. And maybe next time you'll be able to do more. Keep at it! You will improve!!

Take it from me, as time has gone on, I've seen myself improve in almost all of the exercises. I've owned a couple of other prenatal videos and find that I get bored easily or don't feel challenged after a while as the exercises get too easy, too fast, offering little or no place to advance to.

While already somewhat in shape when I started the video, I nonetheless find this workout challenging.  In particular, the tricep dips, the pushups, the shoulder dips, and the keep up exercise are continually kicking my butt (I presume that part of the ongoing challenge has to do with the extra 20lbs I am carrying with me, which will only continue to rise with the pregnancy). I love the labour squats and while I couldn't do the advanced version to begin with, I can do them now! I feel my legs getting stronger and my flexibility improving little by little.

While I have read some criticisms that the video lacks lustre in its production quality, I frankly don't care.  I would gladly pay what I paid time and time again as the exercises are awesome. I'm paying for the exercises, not hollywood bling.

While I can certainly begin to feel the effects of the pregnancy (increasingly winded going up stairs, etc.), I really do hope to continue to do this workout to the very end of my pregnancy.",1214352000,,2781,4.392996108949417
2055929,5,B000227EMI,"This is a really great dvd.  It not only is a great workout, but also answers most of my questions about what you can and can't do exercise-wise while you are pregnant.

The other great thing is that it includes 3 options for you to do, beginner, moderate and advanced, which is something I wish all exercise dvd's did.",1214265600,,411,4.381578947368421
2055930,5,B000227EMI,"Most prenatal workouts are just plain boring and do not work any of my muscles. This DVD is great!

2055932,3,B000227EMI,"After reading reviews of this and the yoga videos, I went with this because it sounded more challenging.  It is challenging, but I find that the stretching sections are far too limited for my preference.  It is really only a TONING video, so if that is what you want it is very useful.  Its sort of like taking a trip to the weight room at the gym.  I was hoping for more stretching and relaxation.

The video moves very quickly from exercise to exercise, which is good after you've done it for a while but difficult at first.

Karyne is a very sweet host and not at all annoying or obnoxious.  Still, I wish I'd gone for the prenatal yoga video.  I may still purchase one, its probably even better to have both!",1212624000,2,712,4.3007518796992485

Even after attempting to take it easy and not over work myself, I still had to take three days off from my daily walk, and it was four days before I attempted the work out the second time. It is a great workout but make sure if you are out of shape that you do not over work yourself and gradually work up to doing the whole work out.

You will need to do cardio on your own though as this is more strength training.,1212019200,,322,4.5964912280701755
2055936,4,B000227EMI,Great quick (45 minutes) workout that gets all your muscles. It's not a cardio workout - so if you're looking for that this isn't for you. It's great strength training however.

2055939,5,B000227EMI,"A couple of months before I got pregnant, I had started doing pilates trying to get in shape. Then, I got pregnant and I had a very shaky first trimester with bleeding, so I didn't exercise at all. Now, I'm well into my second trimester, and my doctor gave me the ok to exercise. I was searching for a pregancy workout DVD and came across this one. It got great reviews, although I was a little scared that the workout might be to hard for me, since I hadn't exercised in a while. But, let me tell you, I'm glad I took a chance with this DVD! The first time I did the workout, I had to pause the DVD 3-4 times to take a break, but I felt really good afterward. I was a little sore the next day, but in a good way. I did the workout again the next day, and I only had to pause the DVD once to take a brake. So, already I'm improving my shape. I even finished the ""Keep up"" exercise, which I couldn't do the first time around. I really love this workout. All the major muscle groups in the body are being worked. Best of all, throughout the whole workout, my belly felt safe and comfortable. The warm up section is very relaxing but leaves you warm all over. The workout is well explained and the instructor is not the least bit annoying. Her voice is very pleasant. Seeing her toned, pregnant body really motivates me to get in shape. There are no silly dance moves to follow, and no jerky movements or sudden change of direction. Just a good toning all over. The cool down section feels great and leaves you stretched and relaxed. I'm complementing this workout with walking and riding my stationary bike for cardio. Some people commented about the dark background and the music, but you really stop noticing those once you get into the workout. The equipment needed to do the workout is simple: a chair, some pillows, hand weights (optional), and a step stool (optional). I also like that there are three levels, beginners, intermediate, and advanced, so the workout can grow with your increasing level of fitness. Before starting the workout, do yourself a favor and watch the instructional segment. It really explains all the upcoming exercises in detail, how to do them safely, and which muscles are being targeted. It also shows you how to use the equipment correctly. It even includes a test to check for separation of the abdominal muscles. I know this DVD costs a little more than some of the other ones, but it's worth every penny. I really love this workout, and I'm looking forward to it every day. After the baby is born, I will get myself back into shape with ""The Perfect Postnatal Workout,"" which also features Karyne Steben.",1209513600,9,2640,4.456611570247934

2055941,5,B000227EMI,"I've done Pilates, yoga, and light kickboxing for three years.  This workout uses some moves new to me that are great and safely target the muscles I want to keep up during pregnancy--thighs, rear, shoulders, triceps, abs.  You have no idea how taxing it can be to hold a tiny baby all the time until you have to do it.  My first child reached 20 pounds by 4 months, and my shoulders and back were a mess.  The second time around, I trained up my muscles a bit, and it was easier.  I'm in even better shape the third time, and I plan to exercise dilligently right through the end of the pregancy.  The instructor in this DVD is awesome, easy to follow, and is matter-of-fact.  I hate the workouts that are syrupy sweet or have you doing moves that are ridiculous--like you're just praying nobody walks in the room and starts laughing at you.  The Perfect Pregnancy Workout is empowering and you'd just hope someone DOES catch you looking fit and strong in the middle of your workout.",1208563200,,983,4.4525139664804465

It WILL take some time to get used to if you haven't worked in a while BUT the results are well worth it.  I wanted to concentrate on my lower part of my body and a few areas up top (arms and tummy) I STAY on the beginners' level and I'm sure like all workouts, once you get used to it, you can up your level.  The GOOD thing about this DVD is that she explains everything in DEEP detail and her voice is not irritating.  She also allows you to do kegel exercises in between reps.  Just take your time, no rush and then when you feel comfortable go for it.  The one exercise that kept me in AWE was her ""keep up exercise"" I was like...OMG...BUT this is a GREAT exercise for mental purposes for your labor.

I suggest going to class also, because not all of the positions on the video are easy to perform without assisted guidance or without first having done them. It's important to know what you are doing so you don't hurt yourself or deprive the baby of blood flow/oxygen by doing the positions incorrectly. It's great for a beginner to intermediate yoga student. Overall it's an excellent coreography of movements and easy to follow format.

I am not one to do many videos as I'm a runner and get bored with videos (or any kind of indoor workout really).  But this workout has a great combonation of toning and stretching and also gets my heart rate up.

I've been told by my doctor that working the abs after 24 weeks is a no no, but go with what you think is right and what your doctor says - everyone has different advice. The production quality is REALLY bad to the point that it's distracting. It's very much like a home video. She is also half-naked throughout the video, which is also somewhat distracting.

However, you have to enjoy this kind of workout, which involves a lot of repetitive motion like lunges, squats, and so on that really work your muscles but can be boring. I'm a swimmer and practice yoga and prefer the fluidity of those routines compared to this. However, the first time I did this video, I had to rest at points (I was about 14-15 weeks pregnant) because I was so tired (and not used to this kind of workout)! I was also sore the next day, but I haven't done it since and I'm at 20 weeks now.

2055958,4,B000227EMI,"I've read a few of the not so positive reviews and I thought it would be nice to clarify what this video is for.
This video is NOT an AEROBIC WORKOUT, and it is NOT going to make you look like the instructor (a former Cirque de Soleil acrobat).  The purpose of this video is to keep your muscles toned until you have your baby.  It will be much easier to lose weight and get back in shape AFTER your baby is born if your muscles are toned.
What is considered difficult and what is too easy depends on what kind of shape you are in to start with.  If all you are doing is aerobic (walking, swimming), then any kind of strengthening exercise might seem difficult.  If you are a body builder and are as buff as the instructor, you probably won't even break a sweat.
Always talk to your doctor before you start.  If you've NEVER exercised, it is definitely a wise idea to speak to your doctor about starting any kind of workout.
It has an upper body, lower body, and abdominal workout, plus Kegels, with beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.
I think it comes pretty close to ""Perfect"" if you are looking to tone muscles.",1202860800,,1122,4.349282296650718

But I bought it based on the positive customer reviews and I'm so glad I did!  I was 5 1/2 months pregnant when I got this video and started with the beginner level of all the exercises.  I'm still on the beginner level, but I like that she gives an intermediate and advanced level as well.  Her French accent keeps me from getting bored while I'm listening.  I watched the instructional section before doing the workout and it helped.  I feel like I could continue doing this video (the advanced level) even when I'm no longer pregnant.  I was satisfying-ly sore the day after doing the video.",1202428800,,716,4.453846153846154

It definately got my heart rate up and made me feel like I was getting a substantial workout.  I liked the fact that there was a bit of yoga in the workout.,1202428800,,325,4.126984126984127
2055961,5,B000227EMI,"I LOVE this video!  I have purchased several pregnancy fitness videos from Amazon and this and the Yoga video from Seattle Holistic Center are my favorites.  A lot of the other videos for pregnancy are very 'fluffy': either the moves are ambiguous or you don't feel like you are doing anything.  This is not the case with the Perfect Pregnancy Workout.  It was well instructed and the demo on how to complete each exercise is very well done. I chose the beginner level for most exercises and really felt that I got a good workout. There is this exercise at the end where you do windmills with your arms for 3 minutes that's a killer!  Best of all, the hip exercises really helped with the soreness I've been having at night while I sleep.  I also have less 'pulling/tight' sensations in my belly after doing this video.  The instructor also has a very cute/soothing French accent.",1202169600,,880,4.602564102564102

My husband has done this workout with me on a number of occasions and I loved being able to workout together.  Be warned that at particularly hormonal moment you will hate Karyne for her perfect fitness.  I'm in pretty good shape and do yoga and exercise regularly, but I just can't compete with Cirque de Soleil.  A lot of the exercises come with easy to difficult modifications so you can tailor the workout to what you need.  I've been doing the workout since the end of my first trimester and it still feels great.  Good luck ""keepin' up!""",1202083200,,662,4.663793103448276
2055963,5,B000227EMI,"Karyne's workout is a great way to get back in shape before having that baby!  I've been an athlete my whole life, but in the past couple of years, my activity level has dropped quite a bit (down to nearly no exercise other than some weekend walking while doing chores around the city).  I'm determined to get back in shape for the delivery of my first child, as I hear it really helps you get through labor.
Karyne is amazingly strong and athletic, wow.  I can now only do about 1/3 of the repetitions that she does for each exercise, even when I'm following the easy version.  I love how she offers both a beginner and advanced view of how to do the exercises.  This is not an aerobic video of running or jogging in place, but I do feel like I am getting some cardio by doing it just due to the effort it takes to keep up with Karyne.
If you're like me, you'll be sweating and breathing heavier at many points throughout this workout.  I'm confident that this video will help to give me the strength I need to carry that baby!",1201824000,,1028,4.246153846153846

People are always telling me ""how Fit"" I am! I wanted something that would use strength training to keep my ams in shape.  I do this Dvd every other day and is is perfect for me.  I like the three levels of difficulty because some days I am too tired to do the advanced excercises.  I tried a few other videos and felt like they were too easy. I did not workout daily pre-pregnancy. I can't wait to see if I look as great as her after delivering my baby!

The different levels were shown in a picture-in-picture format.  The instructional portion of the DVD was very helpful and I suggest all watch it first before starting.

The music was new age and her voice over was well timed and helpful.  I enjoyed listening to her French accent and I liked it when she looked like she was having a good time.

You will need a blanket or padded carpet for the floor exercises, pillows for the ab work, a step if you have good balance for step-ups, and free weights if you desire.  Only the blanket/padded carpet and pillows are required.

This workout along with Shiva Rea's Yoga has made me feel awesome and my pregnancy is going well.  I highly recommend this video for any pregnant woman who wants to sweat a bit and stay in shape during their pregnancy.",1201651200,,910,4.533742331288344

This is the only pregnancy video where I consistently break a bit of a sweat, and have slightly sore muscles the next day, but my heartrate stays at a reasonable level.
I also have Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, which offers good stretching exercises, but I find that I get bored and don't get a very good workout.
I have not kept up a very regular workout routine since getting pregnant, but find that this helps keeps me strong and keeps the backpain at bay.

I've stayed pretty active, but it was a challenge my legs were burning in the end. It's a short enough workout to do on days you don't feel like working out, and long enough to use as a base on the days you feel like superwoman. All in all it's a great video, Karyne is very pregnant the only recommendations I make are to make sure you have everything readily available (chair, pillows, etc...) she moves through everything rather quickly with little transition which on the first time is kind of hard, but you get use to it. Also, some of the knee exercises are painful, I had to put a pillow under my knees because i have hard wood floors in my houses and for my already hurting knees it didn't feel good.

After not exercising AT ALL during the first tri., I was a little nervous before I began the DVD.  Once the workout starts, you keep moving and don't realize how much time has passed.

It is important to mix strength and toning work with cardio as well, and this dvd definitely focuses on strength and toning, but it does it very well. Karyne explains very well the proper technique for safety (especially in the instructional section), but is not annoying at all in her explanations. I agree with another reviewer that the shape she is in is inspiring -- she's muscular and strong, without looking scary-skinny. If you're doing cardio several days a week, I think this workout is a great compliment.  Enjoy!",1196985600,,640,4.756756756756757

I tried to make this workout twice a week, but sometimes it was just once. I combined it with a lot of walking (at least 2 hours a day) and additional exercises for hands and arms used by rock climbers.
The workout didn't help me to get less weight during pregnancy (I got 17 kilos) and I suppose that's just genetics. But now, three month postnatal, I have just 4 additional kilos left and I even started climbing again.

I love that it is mostly strength exercises, but keeps your heart rate up, so you're basically getting a cardio and strength workout in one.

I also have been doing Shiva Rea's Pregnancy Yoga DVD and walking, and I enjoy both of those, but this DVD will really help you keep (or get back) your muscle tone, which should be helpful in labor and when you are running around after a newborn.  THe exercises are easy to follow, and while it is hard to keep up with her the first time, you don't have to sit through instructions every time you repeat the workout, which is definitely a problem with many workout videos.  Once you know the routine, you can just keep up with her without stopping,and this makes the workout go by really fast.  I was only able to manage the beginner variations for many of the exercises, and I was really quite fit before my pregnancy (but have been kind of afraid to push myself too hard during the pregnancy - I'm in my 6th month now).  So I would recommend this for almost everyone, not so fit to fit!  Those advanced level exercises seem really quite difficult!

Loved the thorough stretching at the beginning and end of the tape and the clear directions in the voice-over. It was super inspiring to see a woman who was that pregnant and also that buff! Woohoo!!! I was dead tired by the end of my first round and feel certain that I got a good workout. I'm looking forward to building up to making it all the way through and then trying a few of the advanced or intermediate modifications. I love that she's worked Kegels right into the routine.

I am so grateful to have found this DVD. I am due in 5 weeks and have tried every day to either do this DVD or take a 2-mile walk. I feel like after my baby is born my body will recover very quickly. From this workout, my legs and arms feel strong, I feel like I have retained the flexibility that I had pre-pregnancy from doing Pilates and I feel like it has helped me to manage tension. As well, she inserts Kegels throughout which have absolutely saved me from those leaks that happen when you sneeze or laugh hard while pregnant. I look forward to having this DVD to use if we ever decide to have another child. Note: She does transition from one exercise to the next more quickly than I would like, so I just keep the DVD remote close at hand and pause it while I prepare for the next exercise. This has made this DVD perfect. Without a good remote, it would have moved too quickly for me and I would have lagged behind her throughout the workout, which would have been frustrating. She is in excellent shape and can prepare for the next set much more quickly than I could! The pace of the actual sets was perfect for me, it was just getting ready for the next type of exercise that I was slower on that she.",1186617600,2,1361,4.159090909090909

I have one complaint though.. they  mailed it in a plain yellow non-padded envelope. When I opened it the case was literally in pieces :( I was so mad because it is not a cheap video.

I have Pilates videos that are similar moves but much more entertaining and a better, more balanced workout. I have taught aerobics before and would never have had such dull music and surroundings for a class.

It is not too strenuous yet it gives you a great strengthening workout leaving you feeling stonger and more energized. I do rotate this video with Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor & Birth and feel that I am getting a great workout that will better prepare me for the next 6 months to come.",1182556800,,388,4.328767123287672

2056006,5,B000227EMI,"Cons:

After reading reviews I thought it would be more challenging than it was. I'm in my 3rd trimester and I used to be in shape but since I got pregnant I haven't been doing almost ANY exercises. I was surprised that it was quite mild even for me. There are 3 stages - beginner, intermediate and advanced, but just for several exercises. I'd prefer if it was a bit more difficult sometimes.

Pros:

1. I love the voice and music and the way this program is done. Everything is very clear, the instructor counts for you so you know how many reps you have left, which is nice. She helps with breathing too.

2. Her intonations aren't ""over energetic"", which I really like. She speaks with a slight French accent which I find very cute and it doesn't bother me at all. It's perfectly understandable.

3. If you are looking for a classical aerobics workout you probably won't like this one. I love that it's quite slow but not boring, it just helps you to concentrate on your movements.

  If you are looking for a easy\almost easy general workout for the whole body - this DVD is perfect. If you are looking for more exercises on your lower body - there isn't much there for it. I like Pilates Pregnancy Workout better from this point of view. I'm rotating these two and it seems to keep me more or less in shape and it's not too difficult so I don't drag it.

Some people wrote that they are following it even after pregnancy. I'm definitely going to use something more challenging after my baby is born.",1180656000,,1505,4.404332129963899
2056007,5,B000227EMI,"I'm now 4 months pregnant and in pretty good shape. I do pilates and walk & run regularly and this workout is still a challenge! It'll also be a good postnatal workout as well. As others have said, the woman (I can't think of her name right now... pregnancy brain!) doing the workout is in amazing shape and is inspirational. It's easy to use pregnancy as an excuse to not work out quite as hard, but watching her I know it CAN be done. Of course I still take it easy if that's what my body is telling me, but for the most part I'm trying to keep up with my regular routine. I'm 37 and this is my third pregnancy, and each one has been better than the last because I've worked out a little harder with each subsequent pregnancy.

I bought several prenatal fitness DVDs--including Crunch Prenatal Yoga, Pilates During Pregnacy, Carolyne Anthony's Pregnancy Fitness Program--and this one is by far my favorite.  This workout is challenging but safe, and the instructor demonstrates different levels of intensity so you can match your own fitness level.  I was a moderate exerciser pre-pregnancy (3 days a week for about 45 minutes) but am no exercise freak, and was thrilled to find a DVD that allows me to maintain this moderate fitness level throughout my pregnancy, and go beyond it if I want to.  The workout lasts about 30-35 minutes.

Some unique aspects of the DVD: Kegels are practiced throughout the workout in different positions (rather than in just one position or at one place in the workout).  I also really enjoy the final ""keep up"" exercise--a simple arm exercise sustained for three minutes designed to mentally prepare you for the burning muscle contractions of childbirth.  The instructor does a great job of talking you through the exercise--""If you feel like quitting, visualize holding your baby for the first time""--and it has the nice benefit of giving you buff arms--great preparation for carrying all the heavy baby equipment after birth.",1178150400,12,1351,5.109090909090909
2056013,5,B000227EMI,"I purchased three pregnancy workout DVD's: Denise Austins' Fit and Firm, Pilates During Prenancy, and The Perfect Pregnancy Workout.  The Perfect Pregnancy Workout is far the best out of the three.  You exercise your legs, hips, back, abdomen, pelvis, arms, and shoulders.  I really like how she incorporates kegel exercises.  The instruction section is excellent and informative.  Make sure you watch the instruction section before beginning the workout.  All the exercises are evenly done on both sides.  The DVD also shows modification for beginners, intermediate, and advanced.  It's a 40 minute workout, which is not too short or too long.  I feel energized by the end.

The only thing I did not like about this DVD is that she does not stretch out the quads.  Thus, my legs were extrememly sore the next day from doing the lunges and squats.  I recommend you add in your own leg stretches before actually starting the workout.

I had a hard time getting use to sleeping on my side.  My back and shoulders would hurt all night (even with a body pillow), but this workout strengthened my back and my shoulders and I have been sleeping much better since.  I highly recommend it.",1177977600,6,1181,4.835
2056014,4,B000227EMI,"This is a great video.  You do feel as if you actually did something.  I am 32 weeks along in my pregnancy and I follow the beginning level.  I consider myself a fit person.  I try to workout four days a week to keep up with my exercise level.  The moves are broken down from beginning to advance.  The music has an excellent rhythm to use for each move.  For a great transition make sure you have the following before starting this workout:  a set of pillows or blankets set on top of each other, blankets, a dumbell (or anything for tricep extensions) and a chair.  For advance levels, you need a step up. The transitions from moves to moves needs a little work.

One thing I do follow like the other reviewers have commented are:  if you feel dizzy or tired, stop exersicing.  Follow what your body is telling you.  Modify your moves to your comfort level.  Otherwise, great video.  I also do Niece Pecenka ""Pilates During Pregnancy"" for my alternate days.",1176163200,4,959,4.46242774566474

I use this workout along with Shiva Rea's pregnancy yoga and Pregnancy Pilates by Niece Pecenka.  This is the most hardcore of the three, and I have worked my way up to doing it three times a week.

-The instruction is simple to follow, with excellent transitions

-There is no BS--she gets right down to business and goes directly from one exercise into another, without rushing you

-She is not a perky cheerleader type, she just tells you what you need to know/do for the exercise

-It is a real workout--your muscles are worked from head to toe, she gets every muscle group and you definitely feel it

-She has modifications for advanced and beginner exercisers (with a couple of intermediate modifications), which allows you to do what you can, and still get a good workout

-She's about 8 months pregnant, and she is doing every single exercise with you, which makes you feel like you can do it, too--pushups and all!

-The instructional part goes over diastasis, how to detect it, and how to modify the exercises to ensure you do not make it worse.

I did not exercise at all first trimester due to crushing fatigue and nausea.  Once I started exercising again, this workout was HARD for me.  Now I'm 7 months pregnant and I have great muscle tone all over my body--can even see where the ""six pack"" muscles are over the belly, and I have, as I said earlier, worked up to three times/week with this video.  I feel like it's really helped me get in excellent shape for delivery.  I have her Perfect Postnatal Workout as well, have already viewed it, and will be using it as soon as possible after the birth.

2056020,5,B000227EMI,"I have 4 prenatal videos so I'll mention them and compare them to this one. Skip the end of this review for my favorite to least favorite ranking.

These are my videos listed in the order they were purchased:
- Prenatal yoga - shiva rea
- Perfect Pregnancy Workout
- Neice Pachenka's Pilates while Pregnant
- Leisa Hart's Fit Mama

I started the Prenatal workouts in my 7th week, I'm a competitive cyclist and workout regularly. I had an injury and modified my workouts to Yoga Shakti with Shiva Rea -- a wonderful DVD by the way. When I learned I was pregnant I was looking for something to challenge me gently and safely. So I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prenatal-Yoga-With-Shiva-Rea/dp/B0000BYNMH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prenatal Yoga With Shiva Rea</a>&nbsp;and then stumbled upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Pregnancy-Workout/dp/B000BLKJ5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Pregnancy Workout</a>&nbsp;based on reviews. It's much better than the Prenatal Yoga DVD in terms of feeling like an actual workout. Prenatal Yoga is well done but extremely gentle. So if that's what you're looking for, it's got yoga, kegels, lots of great stretching and soothing music, and candles. **Note**  there are NO yoga mats used in this video, all the work is done on carpet with blankets and chairs. I used my yoga mat and felt more grounded, carpet is quite slippery when barefoot. I'm not sure why Shiva chose to skip the yoga mats, seems risky for the 2nd & 3rd trimester women. Also, my copy did not have the partner massage, which is one reason why I bought it. Overall, I'd give this one 2 stars.

I'm in my 3rd month now and have moved to weight training and walking outside, but plan to resume doing this DVD soon. I grew bored and needed a change. My advice is to find several DVDs that you like and use them in rotation. I liked this one so much I did it too often and finally switched to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-During-Pregnancy/dp/B000AXW0WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates During Pregnancy</a>&nbsp;for a month or so. I found Neice's DVD easy to follow and handy to use the way it's split between abs and legs(hips). I brought it with me when I traveled and was able to do the workout anywhere I had my laptop. It's a 4 star DVD, you definitely feel it in your lower half -- but there's no addressing your arms, shoulders, and back, something I really needed and missed.

One word of warning, as much as I enjoyed the Perfect Pregnancy workout I had some trouble shifting from one exercise to the other. I had to stop the  DVD to pull out my chair and my step and sometimes had to rewind. I also had a tough time seeing the advanced exercises. The DVD shows both regular and advanced in the same window so it can get confusing if you're not used to it. Best to watch it all the way through first -- maybe a few times -- and be prepared to stop and rewind if you need to.

Perfect Pregnancy focuses on arms, back, and shoulders quite a bit. Many of the other prenatal videos do not. It's tank top season so I need all the help I can get! Their are 2 types of dips for triceps, shoulder push-ups that I've never seen before -- but wow do they work! There's a swimming type exercise that can be done with hand weights, this one works shoulders, triceps,lats, and deltoids. As others have mentioned the incorporation of kegels at  multiple points throughout the DVD is excellent. Overall, it does seem to be the ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" that I've found so far. I happily give it 5 stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leisa-Hart-s-Fit-Mama-Prenatal-Workout/dp/1585657565/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leisa Hart's Fit Mama Prenatal Workout</a>&nbsp;is not what I had hoped for. She starts with dance steps that feel a bit lame to me, I love to dance so maybe it's what she's saying about being sexy or it's the repetitive nature of the moves. I dance during that time but I don't follow her steps. I enjoy the yoga fat burn section a lot, it focuses on thighs and glutes and I really feel it. The stretches and kegels that follow are also quite good. I'd place this DVD above Prenatal Yoga in terms of it's intensity and feeling like a workout. I'd give this one 3 stars.

Here's my order of preference, favorite (& most effective) to least favorite of all 4 of these videos.

1) Perfect Pregnancy Workout *****
2) Neice Pachenka's Pilates while Pregnant ****
3) Leisa Hart's Fit Mama ***
4) Prenatal yoga - shiva rea **

If you really want a solid exercise plan, you can't go wrong with Perfect Pregnancy Workout.

I see it as a challenging, effective, and safe workout.",1173657600,4,5155,5.202653799758745

I have noticed improvement in my back and arms...some in my abs, since starting the program over the past few weeks (use about 3 times/week).  I also like that as you improve, you can choose to move between beginner, intermediate, and advanced level workouts.  This way you won't get bored once you've mastered one level of exercise.

When my regular Bikram classes started to become more difficult due to my growing belly I wanted something that would still be challenging enough yet more geared to my pregnant body.  I am SO glad that I stumbled onto this video.  It is challenging enough on days I feel like a warrior but the different levels that are shown in the video allow you to back down a little on low energy days.  I really like that it has a little bit of everything from squats to work your legs, exercises for abs, great hip openers and awesome back, arm and shoulder strengtheners.  I really think that this would be a great workout for people who aren't pregnant!

Important to note that this is not and aerobic workout.  It is a muscle strengthening workout and will require some dumbells, 3lb - 10lbs depending on your fitness level.  You will also need a step of some sort.  A regular sturdy stepping stool from your local hardware store will do.

2056026,4,B000227EMI,"Before I launch into my review, I want to let you know my current fitness level and pregnancy condition since that's pretty relevant to any assessment.

I am 22 weeks pregnant and have been running 3 miles two to three per week throughout my pregnancy.  Prior to conception, I was an avid hiker and had been climbing strenuous mountains all summer.  However, I haven't been doing any strength training.

So, with that said, I finally picked up this video last week since my running career is fast coming to a close thanks to baby bladder.  I've now done the video twice and can say that it is challenging-- I am sweating a few minutes into it-- but totally manageable and not that long.  Today I timed it and the high-exertion portion is only 30 minutes, which means that when you're feeling the burn, you know that it will be over soon.  From warm-up to cool-down, the video is a shade over 40 minutes.

I find the lower-body stuff much less challenging than the upper-body, but that's because of my running and hiking experience.  Because the video has beginner/advanced options, I do the advanced on lower body and the beginner on the upper body.  But already, I'm planning on buying hand weights to try the advanced portion soon.  I can see anyone in relatively decent shape adapting to this workout fairly quickly, especially since I am by no means a fitness guru.

The one beef I have is that the crunches she demonstrates don't feel like they're doing much, but perhaps my form isn't correct.

Overall, I think this is an excellent workout video.  However, for complete fitness, you'll need to supplement with cardiovascular stuff like swimming, jogging, walking, or bike riding.  I plan to switch to swimming a couple times a week and doing this video three times a week.",1169856000,9,1779,4.693548387096774
2056027,5,B000227EMI,"This video is wonderful for many reasons.  To start with it covers a lot of basic exercises that work on the arms, back, legs and stomach.  (The instructional video portion should be watched first to get the idea of how the exercises are done).  I found that the beginner exercises were challenging without being exhausting.  It took me several weeks of working with the video before I felt completely comfortable with both the pace and demands of each exercise. The best part was that when my doctor sat down with me to work on an exercise program I was happy to report to her that I had already been doing all of the exercises that she recommended because they are all included on this video.

Some reviewers felt that the backdrop was boring, however, I have always enjoyed the fact that the backdrop for the video is a gym.  I think studio designed backgrounds are distracting and, honestly, I am using the video to work out, not enjoy the scenery.

I have worked with this video for four months now and was just recently starting on the more advanced techniques.  Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with a kidney problem and need to move all of my exercises to the pool.  I will miss this video dearly and highly recommend it to all pregnant women.",1169683200,2,1255,4.566964285714286

However, none of my muscles ever became fatigued.(except on the tricep dips) Which is good if you're pregnant,  but bad if you are used to feeling the burn.  She moves along quickly, there isn't a lot of time between exercises. The instructor is in very good shape. I don't give it five stars becuse she does minimal for your abs and there are a few exercises that I find pointless. She does take several opportunities for kiegels, which is nice becuse none of the other videos I have take the time for them.",1168819200,,655,4.495798319327731
2056033,5,B000227EMI,"I bought 2 dvds.  This one and Denise Austin's prenatal one.  (Denise Austin's is terrible).

Why I like this one.

1: very simple.  she does all the exercises which I find challenging and there aren't annoying things in the background, she doesn't say annoying things in the video.  she does her workouts with her French accent and you listen to soothing music.

2: she has to be at least 7-8 months pregnant and she does a great job, so it is very motivating.  it is only her in the video, no one else.  this could be a negative though, she is a cirque du soleil acrobat, so obviously more toned than any of us preggers will ever be!!  so, it could make people annoyed watching her, but I find it motivating.

3: challenging.  she has 3 steps for each work out (beg, interm, advanced)so if I can ever get passed interm...or beginner for some of the exercises, I will have other work out routines to try.

4: great dvd!

5: i have a lot of other dvd's which I did pre-pregnancy (well---more like a year pre-pregnancy, got kind of lazy this year) anyways, I probably have 15 b/t pilates, yoga, crunch fitness, etc...and i actually like this one better than all, b/c it is so simple and when you do videos over and over, you end up memorizing the annoying phrases the instructors say...she doesn't do that!",1168646400,,1305,4.451476793248945
2056034,1,B000227EMI,"I purchased this DVD when the weather was changing and I could no longer engage in outside exercise activities of swimming and walking. I wanted some type of workout I could do until the end of my pregnancy.  I considered myself to be somewhat in shape and physically fit, but when I watched the DVD to see what it entailed I quickly realized this was way above my fitness level and that includes the beginner level. Not only that, but I also considered some of the techniques unsafe as I am large due to my pregnancy and I just do not have the balance I had prior to my pregnancy. I was very disappointed because I read the reviews and thought this would be something I could do. I will stick to low impact activities, which I feel are safe and take into consideration my lack of balance. The woman on the DVD is clearly VERY physically fit and I am just not at that level.

I have kept doing weight training and cardio throughout my pregnancy so far and wanted to keep doing workouts at home too. Pilates and toning are my favorites to do. When I first started looking at pregnancy videos, I was concerned that they would all be yoga which isn't my idea of a workout compared to what I had been doing. This workout has several modifications for the legs, core, and arms. My heart rate was up the entire time making it a good way to get the cardio in and it is challenging for me to do. Kegels is explained and incorporated into the workout, which is something I am still trying to remember to practice.

I maintain a good weight level exercising with this video.  I'm not an athlete nor do I work out a lot when I'm not pregnant but this is a good video for beginners and intermediate people.

My physician said that my normal workouts would be just fine till 14 weeks of pregnancy and so I didn't even bother with prenatal videos till I was further along and needed to make modifications. There seems to be very little direction in this area so I was grateful to find a DVD that allowed me to do something I was accustomed to in my newly pregnant state. I'm in my third trimester and this workout video helped me stay toned. I use it alternating with the Shiva Rea prenatal yoga. This also helped strengthen my back and various muscle groups to help support the weight of my growing baby. Also, it helps your state of mind to buy some pregnancy workout clothes that fit and are comfortable. Looking huge in your regular T-shirts can be a disincentive!",1167696000,,868,4.57051282051282

I'm definitely going to buy the postpartum version. In addition, my friend who also worked out to this DVD her whole pregnancy only had to push three times (her first baby too).

It was the only video I've done, including non pregnancy geared workouts, that actually kept my full attention. I never got bored! It's just the right length and the moves aren't repetitive or boringly basic.

I do not think it is quite as challenging as others made it out to be. After a couple of months doing this, I could make it through doing all the advanced moves barely breaking a sweat.

It's nice that she gives you options. This allows you to start off doing 'beginner' moves and progress to the more challenging options.

I like this because I easily forget to do these kinds of exercises daily and this is a nice way to fit them in.

2056055,5,B000227EMI,"The Perfect Pregnanacy Workout

What type of workout is this? Weightlifting, Strength training. It shows beginner, intermediate and advanced for all exercises that can be modified.

Who is the instructor? Her name is Kayrn Steben . She is a acrobat for a Cirque du Soleil company.

What you like about it? I love that this is a challenging workout! She covers your legs really well, My legs sould be totally tone when this baby comes!  And she covers your arms equally as well. I love that she shows you beginner and advanced of the exercises. I am stronger in my arms then my legs, so I can do the advanced in what I am strong in and the beginner in my weak areas!  I also love that she incorporates Kegals in the workout. Which is so important but hard at times to remember to do. I think this is a wonderful workout! Should continue to be a challenge through the whole pregnancy. And she shows you how to still do sit ups, without being flat on your back!

What you don't like about it? At the beginning there is a intro that is very unmodest but you can't just click past it. You can fast forward it though. She isn't modest and doesn't have a speck of fat on her anywhere! roflol But I think that comes from being an acrobat. I can't think of anything I don't like about the actual workout.

What type of music is played? Pretty non-discript.  During the warm up and cool down it is calming and during the rest it is upbeat.

Was it worth the price paid?

After I'm finished with the workout I am definitley tired (in a good way), but energized for doing it! Just seeing how good of shape she is in, motivates me to keep coming back (along with the results).

The music is a little odd (sounds like a drum machine from the 80s) but that's my only complaint. Definitely a good purchase!

I chose The Perfect Pregnancy Workout as something I'd graduate to once I became more fit, and able to do more strenuous routines.  But after going along with the other two dvd's I'd bought, this one is by far my favorite.

The instruction is very easy to follow, and I don't feel like I have to wait for her to explain everything again and again before we can move on with the routine.  I like that this instructor doesn't try to explain everything each time I do the workout, or try to chat with me or be a cheerleader for me.  She encourages at one point by suggesting making smaller movements if your legs get tired, and at another point by suggesting imagining yourself holding your baby.

The exercises themselves are challenging for me as a beginner, and after a month, I've begun moving up to the intermediate level on some moves.  And I love that just when I feel like I can't do another reverse lunge, she switches to the other side, or to another move.  The variety and style of the instructor make this routine a pleasure for me.

  I am not a person who regularly exercises.  I am 4 1/2 mos. pregnant with my 5th child.  I will be 36 years old by the time this baby is born.  I've always been within about 5 lbs. of my desired weight(except during pregnancy, when I gained over 50 lbs. with each, but lost it all within the first 6 mos postnatal), that is, until I hit my 30's.  I started this pregnancy about 15 lbs. over my ideal weight, feeling like I already looked 5 mos. pregnant.  I decided it was time to start a fitness routine.

  I really thought this routine would be very difficult, and made more for the already perfectly sculpted, perfectly fit pregnant woman.  I feel so proud of myself for being able to complete it and keep up with the whole routine.  I have noticed definition in my arms and legs since doing this workout 3x a week for a month now.  I also noticed the back and hip pain I was experiencing before I started using the workout is gone now.

I love this workout, forsaking the others I bought at the same time time, Fit Mama(ok, I actually try to do this once a week, but I don't enjoy it.  The bonus stretches are very good, and the workout does get me sweating and working my muscles.  It's just the conversational style of the narration that turns me off here, and the moves feel very repetitious to me.) and Crunch Yoga Mama(I discovered I'm just not a yoga mama, but it was worth a try).

2056070,1,B000227EMI,"Hi,

I am 32, in month 7 of my first pregnancy, and consider myself in pretty good shape (fast walks twice a week, pregnancy aerobics twice a week, pilates once a week).

I'm a bit confused as to how this DVD received so many high recommendations and accolades. I bought this DVD because of the large amount of user recommendations, and now after doing this workout about 5 times (I tried to give it a fair chance) I can honestly say I couldn't disagree more with what so many users wrote here.

I have so many complaints about this DVD, I've numbered them:

1.)The biggest problem I found is that many of the excersises are difficult to understand in terms of positioning your body correctly and what each excersise gives + why it's important to do, etc. (basic info that almost all other excersise DVD's I know give), and only after doing the DVD for the first time, I realized that instead of the instructor explaining each excersise while she's doing it, all of the instructions are in a special instruction section that is rather long and tedious, which you must watch separately, and take notes (??), which I'm guessing the producers of the DVD thought would be easier than hearing the instructor explain what to do while you're doing it with her.  This left me rather frustrated.

2.) While the instructor of the video seems very sweet and has a cute soothing voice + accent, the excersises she does are very bland and boring, and each one seems to last a very long time - making it both monotonous and difficult.  Some excersises have so many repetitions, it leaves me wondering how they thought this DVD is appropriate for beginners.  There are several excersises where I stop in the middle because my muscles are aching pretty badly - and once again, I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, so this really surprised me. It seems that the instructor is a bit out of touch with reality in terms of the number of repetitions, and I felt that she isn't understanding the concept that some of the people doing the video may not have been acrobats in Cirque du Soleil.

3.) As opposed to most other excersise videos I know where they really invest in a nice studio and scenery (heck, you have to look at it for about an hour, so it is pretty important), here the instructor is by herself for the entire lesson, in a dark (and may I add depressing) gymnastics gym.  This did not help me in terms of having something distract me when the excersises got difficult, and also not pleasing aesthetically to look at.

For anyone who's looking for very good + complete pregnancy workout, I highly recommend Kathy Smith's pregnancy workout, which is an easy-to-follow aerobics + stretching DVD for all stages of pregnancy. I do it religiously, and though it's a bit stuck in the 80's in terms of the atmosphere, leotards, music, corny texts - it's a really great workout which I've become pretty addicted to.

Hope this recommendation helps someone...

And, as others have commented, I feel like I have worked out when I am done! The video also contains ""insets"" showing variations of each exercise for different levels.

It is 40 minutes but doesn't feel that long and you can definitely tell you have worked out afterwards. It moves quickly and doesn't repeat so you won't get bored. The instructor is great- it's obvious she enjoys being pregnant but is really quite down to earth about it. The music is kind of early-techno but I really like it and it's not overpowering- it actually sounds a bit like something from Cirque du Soleil (where the instructor was a performer). All in all- this is a great video even if it has been around for a while (like a good wine- which none of us can have!). For beginners you don't need any special equipment- just a chair (without arms), mat (unless you have thick carpet), and a couple of big, wide pillows (I use the ones from my couch). For intermediate or advanced you'll need the above plus a step (she uses a common kitchen or bathroom step stool, nothing fancy) and a pair of hand-held weights. Have these ready before the video starts- there's not much time in-between exercises. Also, even though it's not really an aerobic workout and uses the mat sometimes, wear your supportive bra & tennis shoes. I always feel better after doing this video- physically and mentally. Keep in mind this is a sculpting workout but my heart rate does go up enough for some cardio benefit. I still supplement by walking on the days I don't do this video or my prenatal yoga (Dr. Christine Anderson's Dynamic Prenatal Yoga) video. I think my legs and buns are actually more toned now than before I was pregnant thanks to this video!

***UPDATED REVIEW:
I just want to mention that I still fully agree with everything I said above but that I wasn't comfortable doing this video once I hit my 7th month. Some of the exercises felt- well, I don't know how to describe it exactly- just not right for my body anymore. It felt like I was overextending and sometimes was painful. I quit as soon as it felt wrong so please listen to your body. I continued to swim, walk, and do the prenatal yoga video (listed above) with ease to stay in shape for the rest of my pregnancy and had a very healthy and active baby girl. I lost most of my pregnancy weight very quickly through nursing and walking but I think alot of it had to do with keeping up muscle tone and cardio health while pregnant. Now that I'm on my 2nd pregnancy (already!) I just chase my toddler for exercise and have actually, so far, gained less weight this time around- without any formal, structured exercise- go figure! Congratulations on all you mommies-to-be! It's an incredible experience.",1144972800,56,3246,4.645217391304348
2056076,5,B000227EMI,"I love this workout!  I only got the DVD a couple of days ago, but I can tell you that it is exactly what I've been looking for!!  I too have been disappointed in the past with pregnancy workout tapes.  They're so hokey and none of them seemed to challenge me physically.

I just sort of fell upon the review for this DVD and I am not the least bit disappointed.  The workout is fast paced and Karyne has you move through the different exercises at just the right times, (when you feel as though you can't do anymore).

As others have said this is not an aerobic workout, but I believe there has to be some aerobic benefit as several times I found myself huffing & puffing.  I've always enjoyed weightlifting and so the strength training in her workout is perfect for me.  Also, there is such a benefit to building strong muscles which in turn burn the fat.

I am 7 1/2 months pregnant and my workout routine prior to this video consisted of brisk walking and chasing after my toddler.  After the first time through this workout I actually felt like I use to when I wasn't pregnant and had had a good workout.  Several days later and a couple of times through the workout I'm still sore but already feel stronger and in better shape.  If you want a challenge, I say you won't be disappointed.  (I haven't even moved to the advanced variations yet, so if you ask me I say there is unlimited potential to how far you can take this video)

Karyne gets down to business and is very efficient at working all major muscles throughout your body.  I especially loved the upper body workout, which I think is so often overlooked in female exercise.

One final note, I really liked how she covered diastsis, (separation of the abdominal muscles) in the instructional section.  I have some diastsis and was told that I shouldn't use my stomach muscles at all, (impossible if you ask me, especially with a 15 month old running around).  She does a great job explaining it and then providing stomach exercises that should be done, (slightly modified so as to not cause any further diastsis and to help you recover quicker).

This is the best $20 I ever spent...my husband also benefits as he doesn't have to hear me complain that I can't get a good workout.",1143158400,14,2244,4.455882352941177
2056077,5,B000227EMI,"First let me say that I was not in terrific shape when I got pregnant, but have been a regular exerciser most of my adult life so my body is accustomed to vigorous exercise.  After a rough first trimester of ZERO activity, I started up on this video at about 18 weeks and absolutely love it.  I also bought the Fit Mama video and am much happier with this one for several reasons.  Having used many, many exercise videos over the years I am happy when I can find one that:  1. Is not boring and repetitious so I actually want to do it again and again  2.  Doesn't have too much dialogue or irritating music  3. Isn't unnecessarily long -- cuts to the chase, gets the workout done effectively and efficiently  4.  Is sufficiently challenging (difficult to find in pregnancy workout videos!)

I am happy to say that this video does all four.  I particularly appreciate the shorter length of this video; the instructor moves through the circuits efficiently and with just the right number of reps to push your limits (safely) yet keep it interesting.  I cannot say this about Fit Mama; after doing the video twice I am not sure that I even want to do it again -- it is terribly boring and annoyingly repetitious, not to mention unchallenging.

I have been having terrible insomnia and this video gets me sufficiently tired to sleep well at night so that I have lots of energy the next day.  As another reviewer mentioned, this video is ""satisfying.""  As a final note, I suspect that this video may be slightly too challenging for those who were not regular exercisers pre-pregnancy.",1141862400,,1579,4.569395017793594
2056078,3,B000227EMI,"Karyne Steben is great and has a strong, beautiful body but I think this workout is best for an athletic person who enjoys floor work, weights, and lunges. I was looking for something a little more aerobic to keep the blood flowing and prevent me from blowing up like a blimp. I'm just starting my third trimester and found this workout a little hard on my knees. I've been doing a combo of Shiva Rea's Yoga Workout, which is great for easy yoga poses and stretching and also Leisa Hart's Fit Mama workout, which is a nice overall workout that includes aerobic and yoga/stretching. Although the Fit Mama workout is a little dated and goofy I'd probably buy her DVD if I could only buy one.  And although Perfect Pregnancy seems best for staying toned, floorwook bores me to tears.",1141430400,58,780,4.571428571428571

(I am an aerobics instructor, so I was in great shape before I became pregnant) This workout is unlike any other prenatal workout I have seen! It has beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels so you can find a comfortable pace that suits you. The workout only takes 40 min, so it is easy to squeeze in. This is mainly strength work and toning, but there is an aerobic advantage because you move from one exercise to the next with minimal rest in between. You definitely feel like you had a great workout once you're done! I am very impressed by this workout, and I will continue to do this throughout my entire pregnancy to keep in shape.",1140825600,9,759,4.467625899280575

2056081,2,B000227EMI,"I exercise regularly before and during pregnancy.  I bought this DVD based on the reviews saying that it was challenging, that she is a professional cirque de soleil performer, etc and was highly disappointed.  There is no warm up and just a few awkward poses.  I guess they are afraid to make a pregnant woman do anything physical.  I have yet to find a prenatal video that is at all challening.  I think it is best to use your favorite exercise video or calss and modify the moves so you feel comfortable.  I am 7 months pregnant and do not find this a good workout.  I feel it is a waste of time to turn it on.  Maybe they are meant for those 8 1/2 months?  i don't know.  I wish Karen Voight would make one for pregnant women.",1140652800,2,730,4.18705035971223
2056082,4,B000227EMI,"The reviews on this product were so overwhelmingly positive that I purchased this DVD, together with several others, which I have personally used and enjoyed more. There's nothing bad to say about the instructor or video, however a few words of caution might be valuable to some women:

1.)Despite no complaints about the instructor, I do not recommend this workout if you are struggling with nausea at all. Even if I've felt well before the workout, I inevitably get nauseous during due to the fact that there is alot of changing levels (up and down) and continued intensity.

2.) The instructor is in excellent shape (a Cirque de Soleil acrobat)--and I guess that should kind of say it all. :) No, seriously, my fitness level is moderate. If I had been in SUPERB shape I would probably give it 5 stars. My overall lifestyle is healthy; I walk several miles most days and do other prenatal Pilates/Yoga/Other workouts a couple times a week. She's ripped, flexible and oh--did I mention that she's a Cirque de Soleil acrobat doing handstands while 8-months pregnant :)?!!! (This was not part of the workout just an 'inspiring' demo at the begining.) If you're not already in great condition, you may find this a bit rigorous.

I was in decent cardio shape prior to becoming pregnant again, and hated the idea of loosing my level of fitness.  I checked with my doctor, and with his approval, I looked for a program that I could use several times a week that would be safe yet challenging.

  This workout is great, because even the beginner level is challenging.  It contains excercises that I had not come across in any other pregnancy video.

  I have combined using this workout along with a prenatal yoga workout (Pilates Fusion) for more flexibility, and have rid myself of back pain while gaining energy.

  I have 12 more weeks to go, and am confident that with these workouts, I will be as comfortable as possible in my growing body.",1138406400,4,798,4.549295774647887

As a pregnant woman (I'm guessing she might be as far along as 8 months) she has virtually no body fat, is extremely ripped and can still do acrobatic moves.  The latter are not part of the movements for viewers, it is in the opening segment.  The point being, her fitness level is extremely high.  I'm in my second trimester, so I think this will be helpful for me now--I should have gotten it earlier.  I doubt I'll be using this in the later stages of pregnancy.",1137801600,,618,4.2844827586206895

She simply tells you what you're doing and counts through the movements. It's a great workout. I felt GREAT afterwards and like I actually got a workout for once. Some of those other pregnancy workout videos are just too simple, and I don't feel like I even worked out. This one makes you sweat and feel GREAT! I highly recommend The Perfect Pregnancy Workout.

I definitely look forward to doing it each time.  It has a lot of variety and covers all fitness areas (muscle development, cardio, stretching) and it is really a workout (i.e. she doesn't assume that beause you are pregnant you are incapable of actual exercise). Also, though this may seem like a small thing, I love listening to her.  She has a very soothing, pleasant voice and the music is perfect for the workout.  I often get annoyed with exercise videos because of the instructors fake peppiness (e.g. Kathy Smith) and this is anything but that.

2056091,5,B000227EMI,"I purchased and tried 3 prenatal fitness DVDs around the same time:

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout

* Prenatal Yoga

* Leisa Hart's Fit Mama Prenatal Workout

Here's how I thought they compared.  (Note that I do yoga and walk regularly; while I enjoy dancing, I do not dance regularly.  I'm not overweight.)

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout - 5 stars.  Designed and narrated by a Cirque du Soleil acrobat (faint French accent), this video is my favorite of the three.  The woman demonstrating the workout is about 8 months pregnant and in amazing athletic shape (visible muscle definition).  The theme of this video seems to be preparing for birth and staying strong and fit.  It has two sections: (a) workout and (b) instructions.

  (a) After a mercifully brief cheesy earth-mother introduction, the yoga-based workout is vigorous yet flowing and straightforward, building incredible muscle strength, flexibility, and stamina.  It includes squats, lunges, lots of ab work, lots of great hip stretches, kegels, lots of different arm strengtheners.  At the end I am sweating, breathing harder, relaxed, and satisfied.  The next day my muscles are sore (in a good way) and feel stronger.  The music is world-beat without vocals, easy to exercise to.

  (b) The instructions section is excellent as well.  Animated anatomical graphics clearly illustrate diastasis, how to check yourself for it, and how to modify your workout to avoid further muscle separation, as well as exactly what kegels are.  This part also explains in depth how to do the moves in the workout.

* Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars.  Designed and narrated by a UCLA-graduated yogi, this video is my second favorite.  Shiva is under 3 months' pregnant in the demonstration but has women behind her in second and third trimesters.  The theme of this video seems to be relaxing and preparing for motherhood.  It has three sections: (a) workout, (b) massage, and (c) interview.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy, but includes squats, lunges, many spinal twists, kegels (no deep explanation, just metaphor), lots of different stretches.  At the end I am sweating a bit, relaxed, and satisfied.  The music is new-age without vocals.  For some reason, Shiva does not pronounce the ""h"" in ""exhale"" which can be distracting.  Also the narration gets slightly out of sync with the demonstration in a few places, which can be confusing.

  (b) The massage section is fabulous if you have a partner willing to watch it and give you one!  Great techniques for feet, legs, back, and neck.

  (c) Shiva explains her story in the interview, how her father named her after an Indian god, how she took up yoga in college, etc.

* Leisa Hart's FitMama - 2 stars.  I bought this on Amazon's recommendation and I'm sorry I did.  My biggest gripe is that this video doesn't focus on smooth continuous deep breathing, unlike the other two DVDs.  Leisa is a perky actress who does infomercials.  She is 8 months pregnant in this but her body looks very different (thin, wiry) compared to the woman's in Perfect Pregnancy (athletic).  The theme of this video seems to be feeling better (sexier) about oneself while pregnant.  It has basically two sections: (a) workout and (b) bonus stretches.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy yet goes at a faster, more erratic pace than either of the other two videos.  It has four parts: salsa dance, ""yoga fat burn,"" labor and delivery prep, and prenatal stretch and relaxation.  The dancing is about 8 moves repeated, with a few squats.  I feel foolish and bored doing this.  The yoga fat burn is more aerobics than yoga, includes ab work, squats, no twists, never holds any pose for long, is repetitive.  Labor and delivery prep includes kegels (no real explanation), many boring arm swings, ab work.  Prenatal stretch and relaxation includes leg stretches, ab work, is repetitive.  The music is salsa, soft rock, and world beat without vocals; very good workout music, loud in places.

  (b) The bonus stretches are the best part, but are buried under Special Features (the DVD doesn't seem very well organized).  These include leg, back, hip and shoulder stretches actually held for several seconds, squats, plenty of rapid boring arm swings.

All three videos show women in different trimesters doing the exercises and mention appropriate modifications.  All three videos explain how to do the exercises safely and how to recognize warning signs of overdoing it.

If you're a yoga gal like me and you want to buy just one prenatal yoga video, get Perfect Pregnancy.  If you want your partner to give you a great massage too, get Prenatal Yoga.",1134604800,"1,044",4676,4.940721649484536
2056092,5,B000227EMI,"I've researched a lot of pregnancy workout videos, and the outstanding comments for this one do not lie. I did the workout for the first time this morning and it was fantastic! My arms are sore and my belly/butt feel toned for the first time since I mellowed out my exercise routine after finding out I was pregnant.

This is THE video for anyone who is lamenting the fact that most pregnancy workouts are too easy. I've tried FitMama and Prenatal Pilates (with Shiva Rea). Both have their place in the world of PG videos, but neither matches The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, in terms of challenging strength training and pace (not too fast, not too slow).

This video concentrates on strength training, not so much cardio. But you can always supplement this workout with walking or swimming. There's use of light hand weights (for ""advanced"" exercisers), side crunches (I'd been wondering if ab training was safe), squats, leg lifts, and pushups (killer!).

The only thing you may (or may not) miss are the constant reminders to ""breathe"" and ""check your fatigue level"", like some other videos do. But hopefully that is something that you can do on your own. Don't get me wrong, the beginning of the video has all the standard safety reminders for pregnant women, but it does not feel compelled to remind you over and over throughout the workout. The narration is clear and the woman working out is in fabulous shape - a true inspiration.

One thing to be wary of for women who are slightly competitive: Sometimes, I felt like taking on the advanced moves, when really I'm just a beginner/intermed. Don't fall into this trap. Do what feels comfortable and don't hurt yourself!

I was impressed with the arm section of the video as well because most pre-natal videos I've tried don't incorporate many arm exercises.  We will need strong arms later to carry our baby around after the birth.  This video incorporates strength exercises and pilates movements that keep it interesting.  The pace of the video is good with very little instructing time between exercices.  This will make it nice if you have done this video a hundred times (never boring).  The mood is also very calming with low lighting and meditation music.

Highly recommend for all fitness types and it is worth the higher price.  I just wish it also came in DVD format.  I will definitely be purchasing the post-natal workout as well.",1126137600,6,969,4.668639053254438

she explains the moves in a special section, so in the workout itself, she explains too, but in general, so it doesn't interupt the pace.

The workout is chalenging, but not too much, just right.

It is interesting, I don't get bored, and it really works on the muscles, to help you strengthen your body to birth, and afterwards. There are modifications for advanced exercisers, but I usuly don't do them. I love the moves, and the atmosphere.

This is Karyne Steben's actual workout, not something that she came up with to show other people. She was in incredible shape during her pregnancy and was able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight within 4 weeks of giving birth. This is not to say that your results will be the same, but doing what a top athlete did during this physically demanding period in her life can certainly put you on the right track.

I did mostly the ""beginner"" exercises though I don't consider myself a beginner (I usually do the advanced exercises in all the other prenatal tapes) I do feel that I will have to supplement with some aerobics on the days that I do this tape.

I was a real work out hound, did so four to five times a week at home with Buns of Steel and Kathy Smith Kick Box etc.  So I wanted to keep in shape.  This video was worth the money as she really uses all your muscles, and is in great shape herself.  She picks up weights too a bit which is good.  It is definitely different than the Buns of Steel 8 which is more pregnancy aerobics and good for that.

I would not suggest using the step though for the opening moves.  It seems like it could do what step classes did in the 90's - make your butt actually bigger - and I prefer to just do the Level 3 on the floor.

She also does Kagels which reminds me to practice everyday!",1114992000,2,780,3.9551282051282053
2056103,5,B000227EMI,"I've tried just about every pregnancy workout out there and I love yoga and pilates, but wanted something that would be a bit more traditional, yet challenging. These videos are somewhat hard to find and are generally about a decade old.

I saw this video by scrolling and going back to the last page of my search--I have no clue why this video is back that far, as it's awesome!

I just finished the workout at the beginner level (and I certainly wouldn't consider myself a beginner exerciser), and I feel as though I've just completed one of my runs (but in a good way!)

My big concern, I have to admit, was the lunges.  I have bad knees (although with a wrap, I can generally run OK) and lunges can be a nightmare. I thought I'd grit my teeth and bear it. They were fine! She has the perfect amount for challenge, but changed to a different movement just when I thought I was going to need to stop.

Another awesome thing is that while it's not aerobic, but a sculpting program, I could still feel my heartrate climbing up to where I like it to be when I exercise. I'm adding this one to my favorites collection (meaning it's now on my regular rotation) and I so wish I'd found this tape earlier (this is my 3rd pregnancy).

My first pregnancy, I was a couch potato and had all sorts of drugs during labor (my attitude was ""give me whatever you have"") and with that came a lot of interventions as well. My second pregnancy, I remained active and was able to get through labor with no interventions and completely drug free. I'm hoping that this time around, as I'm in even better shape, that with my exercise program and hypnobirthing program I will be able to go through labor even better.

My only complaint is that this video didn't pop up on the first page of my search--it's seriously worth every penny!",1113004800,230,1812,4.391044776119403
2056104,5,B000227EMI,"I bought this video because I was feeling extremely fat. :( I knew that I had to do SOMETHING positive to make myself feel better- physically and mentally. I am SO HAPPY that I bought this video! Because it's a sculpting workout, I can really see a difference after having used it for three weeks. My arms and legs are definitely more defined and my body has a shape again!

I highly recommend that anyone who is pregnant also check out the Frequently Asked Questions section about pregnancy exercise on Karyne's website: [...] It answered A LOT of questions that I had about exercising safely.",1101427200,47,594,4.6571428571428575

8020295,5,B000227EMI,"This is a good workout, I like how she shows modified versions of the exercises and gives you reminders throughout.",1501459200,,115,4.8
8020296,5,B000227EMI,"This is a great workout for women who regularly did weight training prior to becoming pregnant. It is no nonsense with no annoying chatter and includes modifications. I think the pacing is perfect where she does the reps a bit on the slower side which I prefer so I keep better form and so I don't end up huffing and puffing. It is definitely not cardio so I wouldnt recommend it for that and if you haven't done free weight training before you might be a bit lost since she doesnt explain things in depth. Also love the warm up and the Pilates style hip and leg section on the floor. Downsides are the production quality, the intro and the arm circles at the end are a bit silly but overall great workout.",1499126400,,706,4.315789473684211
8020297,4,B000227EMI,"This workout is great, but it's so challenging (for me), that it's really hard for me to get motivated to actually do it. She does a great segment with repeated deep squats, & the first time I did this I was sore for 4+ days, lol. I wish she had more workout options, so they could be staggered to create a 5-7 day schedule. I'm big on schedules. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because the production quality is rather low. The workout is really good though. I highly recommend it.",1495843200,,487,4.247311827956989
