8410098,5,B003ZBYGBA,"For anyone that wants this, I would suggest looking into what you are getting first. It is a completion thing for a lot of people, and it houses only released stuff. That said, it does have some videos and I always think those are nice.

This is a Live album that comes with a DVD and a CD. It was recorded in 2009, from the Rocket Science tour, and is nice enough to own. There are a few things in here I really liked, too, and i thought it was a 5/5 for me as a FAN. as a person listening to the album casually, this is something to pick up IF you find it at basement dealing. Otherwise, you are on your own.

The list here is for the helping hand. first is the CD list, then the DVD and the bonnus stuff. I hope this helps out because, all in all, you can look uup anything to see if you want it live.
