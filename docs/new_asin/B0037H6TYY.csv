8603275,3,B0037H6TYY,"I purchased this one along with ""Japanese Drama - LIAR GAME - w/ English Subtitle"" from the same supplier. I got two DVD's different from what I ordered, though. I recieved ""Liar Game Season 1-2"" and the Japanese movie ""Kaiji"".
The Season 1-2 was great - pictures ans sound followed eachother, the solution was good... But the subs only came out good until the end of season 1 and the end of season 2. The last episodes in each season have got wierd subs that don't match logically, and the names change in the subs, too. Other than that, the acting's great, and hte whole concept of the Liar Game was well thought of :)",1299628800,,620,4.4
