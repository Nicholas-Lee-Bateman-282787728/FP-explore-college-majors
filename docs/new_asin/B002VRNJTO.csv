8382454,3,B002VRNJTO,"In GFC Las Vegas Punishment the women are better looking and better trained than in the first installment,Beautiful Butchery. The first three matches are decent(the Liz vs Kissy match is my favorite). But after that, the long interviews and those two two minute rounds really grind the DVD to a halt. Six matches total:Gina vs Taslia, Kaila vs Kneilly, Liz vs Kissy, Rainbow vs Leslie, Rainbow vs Taslia, and Gina vs Leslie. Although Punishment wasn't horrible, if it had longer segments on the hotter women, shorter matches, and skimpier ring attire, it would've been a much better product.",1333497600,,591,5.040816326530612
