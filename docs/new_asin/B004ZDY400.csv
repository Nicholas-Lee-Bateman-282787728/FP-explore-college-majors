4507862,5,B004ZDY400,"""Oranges and Sunshine"" is a drama film based on the work of English social worker Margaret Humphreys who discovers the practice of British child deportation to Australia and Canada.

Many of the children were sent to Australia following World War II and up until the early 1990s. These children often came from single parent homes or circumstances where their parents had difficulty supporting a family, and the children were placed in temporary government care, but unknown to their parents and relatives the children were sent overseas. This practice became known as the ""Home Children"" scandal.

The narrative exposes the misrepresentation of a new and wonderful life that the children were promised in Australia and how both the British and Australian Governments coordinated the activity, which wasn't disclosed to the public whilst the deportations were taking place.

The film draws attention to the lives that the children faced in Australia and the tenacious efforts of Humphreys to help them try and find resolution.

It is a quality movie with an impressive cast of British and Australian actors. Emily Watson (Margaret Humphreys), Hugo Weaving (Jack), and David Wenham (Len) provide a moving performance.

4507863,5,B004ZDY400,"This is an excellent film and Emily Watson is outstanding in the lead role. Emily plays the part of a social worker who begins to uncover the systematic transfer of poor and often neglected children into virtual enslavement in the British Commonwealth, primarily Australia. This heroic social worker began to unravel a terrible injustice whereby poor children, often taken into protective custody and social services, were then shipped out of the country, often to situations where they became slave labor and were physically and sometimes sexually abused. The acting throughout the film is outstanding since many of the men who were victims as children had repressed memory and suppressed anger. She works to re-unite families where children were taken away from poor families, primarily single poor mothers. Years later she reunites daughters and mothers, sons and mothers, and siblings that were separated by the authorities. The film is a frightening reminder of how thin the line of ethics and morality can be in the handling of those with little power. What could be wrong with working poor boy children as common laborers in a Roman Catholic monastery? In fact, much violence, physical and mental, was inflicted on these children and thus the social worker must heal at several levels. It is a film about heroic behavior, the kind of heroics where a basically good person rises above threats and red-tape to seek healing solutions for others. I would recommend this film to anyone but I especially think that young social work students in colleges should see the film to see the field of social work at its finest hour.",1331942400,2,1626,5.048327137546468
4507874,4,B004ZDY400,"I have not had an opportunity to watch this, but it is high on my list. Anyone who has followed the PBS series of ""Call the Midwife"" will immediately be reminded of a chapter where 3 little children are finally 'saved' from their ignorant, slovenly parents by the social services provided at the time (1960s). The last scene shows the kids walking up a gangplank to a ship bound for Australia.  There were thousands of people of all ages who were conveniently 'transported' to Australia so there are many more stories like this one. I am looking forward to watching this as soon as my 'video streaming' fixes itself ;)",1496620800,,618,4.618181818181818
4507875,5,B004ZDY400,"Yes, this is important and very timely for it to be advertised again.  With ICE separating families in the USA, if they are successful in continuing to the ultimate outcome, what will become of all the US children who no longer have parents to raise them, care for them, and protect them.  This could well be repeated in this country and Should Not.",1495238400,,349,4.523809523809524

4507878,5,B004ZDY400,"The production was well done but the  historical story-line was very disturbing both with government attitude and the sadness the deportation caused to the children in adult later life..... this is really a movie which  everybody should see about the ruthless attitude that is shown towards children which is then blamed on the parents because of poor circumstances..
Life for most of us has many hurdles but the attitude of governments in forcing the very young with stories of ""oranges and sunshine"" being what they can expect when mostly it was child ""slave labour"" which introduced them to a new life in whichever country they were sent to.......'
Not every child had a bad outcome but the percentage from 130,000 over the years during the 20th century turned out to be ""the luck of the draw"".  Hardly worth the misery caused for the children of those days who missed out on a decent introduction to life away from their birth country.",1493510400,,939,4.819875776397516

4507881,5,B004ZDY400,"This was a good movie, yet the subject matter was disgusting. As is typical of the Catholic church, they were allowed to abuse children and take advantage of the poor. I appreciate the actual work of the woman portrayed in  this movie, and felt Ms. Watson, the actress did an excellent portrayal.  The story, being  British,  might seem ""slow' for some, since it was certainly not action-packed in a ""Die Hard Bruce Willis"" kind of way. As far as not being able to understand the dialogue, as other reviews stated, I.m unsure as to why the close captioning could be turned on for most. I did look at all the one star reviews, and saw that many didn't like the subject matter. When 130,000 children are discovered to have deported, taken away from their families while being told those families could visit, and then being told by those authorities in charge of them that their parents were dead; then being raped and repeatedly abused for years, I can see why this could be hard to watch. However, perhaps the point of the movie is that we be aware of what goes on in our society, as much as possible, to prevent the possibility of this ever happening again. As a teacher who LOVES her students, I shudder at the thought of this happening to anyone!",1492819200,,1249,4.5377777777777775

I also watched ""A Royal Night Out,"" where she was equally good as the queen.  I want to watch every film she has been in.  Of course, a big bravo to the real Margaret Humphries for revealing this scandal.  I knew nothing about it until seeing this film.",1488844800,,472,4.441860465116279

True story of orphans shipped off to Australia from Britain during the middle part of the 20th century. In other words, not so long ago.  I was not happy that no justice was given to the victims.

4507903,5,B004ZDY400,Great story and very well acted by all! It was really  hard to believe that that practice went on for so long and it was covered up so well. It was a tragedy that it was allowed to go for so long with no consideration for either the children or the parents and then to find out how horribly they were treated. It is inconceivable why both governments permitted those horrible conditions and treatment of those children under there care. It is disgusting,1488326400,,453,4.457831325301205

4507905,5,B004ZDY400,"When I first saw the ad for this movie I thought they were talking about years and years ago I didn't realized this happened in my life time.  That was a SHOCKER!!  We have heard of the young Irish girls who their babies and had to work in a laundry headed by sisters.  I thought that was an outrage. For them to be treated so very cruelly. And then to see this movie and to hear that England would take on this cruel deed and then deny it for years and years.  What really makes my blood boil is once again religious factors had some hand in this, what they did to young boys and I imagine young girls too. I can only hope they rot in hell for their evil deeds.
I cry for those who didn't find their family, and am happy that some did and I hope and pray that some made peace with it all. For the lady who nearly gave her life in devotion to these children, I hope the Lord keeps his arms around her forever.",1487980800,3,909,3.978021978021978

4507907,5,B004ZDY400,"It sickens me that this could have happened. People need to see this. It was bad enough that the children were sent there, but without birth certificates and any sort of identity is absolutely shameful. The officials in England claimed they had the best intentions for the kids, right! And then why didn't they follow through and find out what was actually happening. 130,000 took years. These English children were sold into slavery by their government. These weren't criminals, these were innocent children. And then the government wanted to cover it up and to offend the people who did it and were still alive. Unbelievable. And the Australians were the worst. They had the children for free. Beautiful innocent English children, and they abused them. The children were right there and they never checked up on them. And then both countries tried to cover it up. I never want to see this again. It makes me too sad.",1486857600,5,918,4.8164556962025316

4507910,4,B004ZDY400,"It was a very shocking, sad story that I couldn't have imagined happening.  How could the terror and shame of imprisoning 130,000 children for so long with physical/emotional abuse been kept a secret like that?  I guess back in those days with no cell phone and the building of the monastery  being so far away in the middle of nowhere they managed to keep their secrets better. I am also curious about why Britain sent them in the first place?  Was there not enough foster care or counseling in their country so they ignorantly thought it was a safe place even up into the 1970's?  They weren't able to check the place out?  Apparently these ""priests"" fooled the Brits into thinking they were a decent Christian church.  I'm missing a piece to the puzzle here....",1486684800,,764,4.614814814814815

This was 1961.  I know Dr Barnardos is still doing great things, what happend during those years we still do not know.  I think how lucky I as not to have been deported!  What an evil thing to do and thus far the British and Australian government have never give up all the information or paid.  But what price do you put on this.  For those who suffered so badly , my heart breaks for you, my prayers are with you.  My brother.s name was or is Andrew, our surname, name at the time was Gardiner, he would be about 59 now.  We are not sure if his name was changed.  My heart is breaking .  I think the lady who did this should get  a medal. I have PTSD and she got it and many of the 130.000, I say it again  One Hundred and Thirty Thousand children, problby more are out there. I know what the feeling of loss of identity feels like.

4508071,5,B004ZDY400,"I have just watched  ""Oranges and Sunshine"" I've had it for awhile but was not ready to watch it. If you have not you have missed a truly amazing heart warming and heroic story that will touch your heart. It is not only of the children's plight but that England discarded nearly 130,000 children from the 1940's and on.
In 1986 a woman came to Margaret to try to find out who she was and to find her mother, and then Nicky came to her looking for her brother Jack, these  two stories had the same beginning so Margaret looked into their stories. Until the early 1970s, thousands of British children -- many orphans, others taken by social workers from broken homes -- were packed onto ships bound for Australia. Promised ""oranges and sunshine,"" they were gong to the land of Oz! But instead endured abuse in workhouses as virtual slaves. In 1987, Nottingham, England, social worker Margaret Humphreys learns the horrific extent of this program as she attempts to help these two of its survivors, the timid Jack and the violent Len and find out so much more.
Based on true events, the real Margaret Humphreys was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1993, and awarded Commander of the British Empire in 2011 for her work.
It's the story of the children who survived and of Margaret Humphries and her husband Melvyn social workers who tried  to help these children who were discarded and sent off to Australia on ships to work on farms beaten,raped and made to work until their debt was paid. They like so many wanted to know the Who, what, and why were they there and if anyone truly loved them, and why did no one care. Some never made it!
I thought I had it bad at St. Annes Orphanage in Worcester Mass but truth be told I now see we were just disciplined for our mischievousness and bad behavior. I do know that I felt the same as these children because I felt empty and unworthy not knowing the why's. I was fortunate I got a second chance in life and believe I made it count.
It took so many years for England to admit their wrongs to these children nothing in the world could repay what they had done! Their wounds would never heal. In 1986 victims were pressing for an apology from the British government, which ultimately was delivered by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in February 2010.
Bearing in mind the shocking truths of this story, I know it will be with me for a long time. Watch this and consider how lucky you are!

4508156,5,B004ZDY400,"I read the book first. The story is very moving and intense, not to mention frightening. One thing mentioned in the book that is not touched on in the movie: there was a racial element to the migration scheme -- an ironic one. Australia was eager to populate their country with as many white people as possible, to strengthen the presence of their 'race.' Great Britain cooperated by shipping these children. As discussed in the movie, but not in too much detail, many many of the children were sent to Australia without the knowledge or permission of the parents. Post WW II Britain wasn't a rich place and many families were struggling. That is why so many children ended up in homes. Parents were sometimes told the children had died.

Back to the movie: I was afraid the movie wouldn't do justice to the true story of Margaret Humphreys' search and discoveries. I was wrong. The acting is superb. The movie tells the story in almost perfect chronological order. The personalities of the main participants are exactly as I remembered them from the book. The settings are as I imagined them in my head. Was this produced in the UK? Hollywood could learn a few lessons from this piece of film making.",1473465600,,1201,4.665094339622642

It is about what one woman did, along with her husband, to reveal what I am sure the British government wished would never be known to the public.  To be fair, she did have a lot of support along the way.  It begins with adults still hurting and someone listening and taking them seriously.

4508340,5,B004ZDY400,This was a very good movie about something that we had never heard of - the deportation of children from England to Australia.  The parents nor the children knew why this happened.  The story only came to light when grown children who knew they had come from England began to question who they were and where their parents were.  Some had been told their parents had died which was untrue.  The parents had no avenue to find their children.  It was pretty shocking and then further revelations of the treatment of the children once in Australia was sickening.  Another story of a big government cover up and misuse of its power.,1466467200,,628,4.612612612612613

It brought home to me that the horrors of the past can and will be repeated and I pray there will always be good, kind and compassionate people  that have the courage and strength to call out the church and government on atrocities perpetuated by people they placed in charge of protecting children and individuals that are too helpless to help themselves. Gd bless all the individual's  that didn't allow what happened to these children now adults that were treated brutally like slaves or indentured servants to be swept under the rug. I hope there are individuals working on a class action to get compensation from the church and government for anyone that this happened to. I would love to see a second part to this movie.

Cannot believe that 130,000 British children were shipped away to Australia and abused on many levels -- made to work in horrible situations and included physical, mental, and sexual abuse by the priests. Emma Watson's portrayal of the social worker who couldn't be stopped in trying to uncover the true stories of these victims who were now adults is brilliant.

The number is astounding.  I truly appreciate the dedication of the social worker who tried to right a wrong, what an uphill battle and the anguish of those left wondering why it happened to them.

Many of them had been taken away from their mothers even though their mothers wanted to keep them. As the children grew up, they were told they were orphans even though they later found that relatives had been looking for them for years.

Suffering that has a face is experienced by humans more deeply. If the numbers are faceless and too great, we do not identify and the catharsis is lessened. Thus, the film focused on the people, the lead character and a few who suffered the deportation. Others were filtered in stories to tug at us on an emotional level. For people deeply touched and hungry for more documentaries and books can provide the more concrete knowledge. The important lesson for the rest of us is to accept the evil in man, even from those who purport to be the guardian of god's words.

This story depicts the cruelty and trauma many children within government/foster care experience. It sparks deep thought about the many times atrocities such as this story have and continue to occur in the world and have not yet been uncovered.  My heart and prayers go out to the many children who experience such deep hurts and later grow into adults who struggle with the past of their childhood. I am sickened by the many wolves in sheep's clothing and find comfort in knowing that one day they WILL STAND BEFORE GOD and will feel HIS WRATH AND JUDGEMENT for the perverse acts they commit to innocent children!  Thank GOD for angels such as Mary Humphreys who sacrificially stand in the gap for these souls and decide to willingly subject themselves to compassion fatigue & PTSD in the quest for the truth.

4508761,3,B004ZDY400,"What promised to be a great story plucked from an 80's UK scandal turned out to be so so despite the stunning, usual performance by Emily Watson. The tale of how unwanted children were shipped from England to a facility run by the Christian Brothers from the '50s on and subject to all kinds of abuse had immense emotional content potential. But the film unfolds in a matter of fact way, we've seen it all before, and didn't ever reach the emotional pitch implicit in the story values. Also the heroine's shuttling back and forth between the UK and Austrailia was confusing. At times I wasn't sure if she was back in England or still down under. The shameful indifference of government officials guilty of the neglect wasn't fully exploited by the script either. And the end, which was nothing but a few text scrawls and an audio of ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologizing on behalf of the government for sins nearly 40 years before left us thinking, is that all? Was no one prosecuted for the outrages? And why?",1440633600,,1015,4.644444444444445

4508776,5,B004ZDY400,"I am left with a huge heartache after watching this movie. The details of the suffering precious thousands of children endured, not to mention their parents, at the hands of the British and Australian governments are nearly unendurable and incomprehensible. But, as the movie makes clear, blame is not really helpful. It's part of the human tragedy that the weak and  innocent suffer at the hands of the evil and powerful. It's happened countless millions of times and will continue for countless millions more.

The most important takeaways from this work are that one person can change things and also that when a person puts his or her heart and soul into that change, the effort is what is important, not the fact that change doesn't mean all wounds are healed or wrongs righted. Like that anecdote about the man throwing sea animals back into the sea from the shore who was told he was not making any difference, one has to say, ""It made a difference to that one."" As a person who tries to be one of those people, I found that encouraging and restoring.

The question in a situation like this inevitably arises, ""Why would God allow something like this?"" Well, evil is in charge in the world, not God. He gave the world to us, and we have made a mess of it. But those who did these crimes against children will ultimately face the justice of a righteous God, if they have not already. As Luke 17:2 quotes Jesus, ""It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.""

Emily Watson, who played Margaret Humphreys is a sensitive and skilled actor. Her gentle but strong demeanor.is comforting and completely believable. When I see her name on the credits of a movie, I know it will be worth watching.",1439337600,5,1795,4.565217391304348

It is a hard story to watch, but it is also a bit confusing at times.  As I watched the story, it was clear that you had to know some of the backstory to really understand what was going on and to what places and situations the characters were referring.  As an American, I had not heard of this situation, but after I researched Margaret Humphreys and the Child Migrant Trust the picture was a little more clear.  It seems to be a similar situation to the Orphan Trains in the US, where intentions were good, but follow-up often was inadequate and some children suffered from abuse and exploitation.  It makes me wonder what we might find out about our own Orphan Train history if it could be adequately researched.  This film raises lots of questions about the best way to serve children who become separated from their families when their parents cannot adequately care for them.

Instead of offering the kind of scope that a documentary about these child deportations would have, _Oranges and Sunshine_ is narrowly focused on the social worker who pieced together this historical scandal and worked to rectify what she could, person by person. The movie's slow build-up mimics the slowly mounting stress of Margaret Humphreys as she uncovers the increasingly ugly and depraved behavior of those responsible for the children. The film is successful in conveying the emotional costs and rewards of naming and addressing horrible injustices--and itself continues the work of Humphreys in bringing knowledge of this scandal to those who might not otherwise be aware.",1428624000,19,874,5.340579710144928

4508866,4,B004ZDY400,"ORANGES AND SUNSHINE is an angry movie, that gains much of its power from the unemotional way in which director Jim Loach tells the story.  There are no scenes of overt violence; rather he lets the middle-aged victims of government policy in the mid-Fifties tell their stories to Margaret Humphreys (Emily Watson) in harrowing detail.

In the immediate post-war period, extending right up to 1970, the British government transported ""orphans"" - as they euphemistically put it - to Australia with the promise of uninterrupted sunshine and oranges every day (hence the film's title).  None of the children were ""orphans""; rather they were the illegitimate offspring of women who had  ""got into trouble"" and had their babies forcibly taken away from them by the authorities.  The policy of enforced transportation took these unwanted children off the government's (and the charities') hands.

ORANGES AND SUNSHINE tells the stories of these children, all of whom have now grown up.  Many of them experienced almost unbearable horrors during their formative years; and until Margaret gives them the chance, they have had little or no opportunity to talk about these experiences.  Set in the late Eighties, the film depicts Margaret's struggles both to find the children's natural parents, as well as persuade some of the authorities involved to admit their culpability all those years ago.

The action shifts between Nottingham in the United Kingdom and various parts of Australia.  As portrayed by Watson, Margaret comes across as an indomitable yet sympathetic figure, who never gives up on her clients, despite many attempts to dissuade her.  The clients, who include Jack (Hugo Weaving) and Len (David Wenham) find it difficult to come to terms with their pasts, even four decades later.  One sequence is particularly harrowing where Margaret and Len visit the Brotherhood in the wilds of Australia; their impressions are intercut with interviews from other victims about what happened to them while staying with the Brothers when they were children.  Out of sight, out of mind provided a convenient pretext for many of them to suffer the most unimaginable indignities.

ORANGES AND SUNSHINE ends with a series of black-and-white archive footage of some of the real-life children smiling innocently at the camera as they boarded the ships bound for Australia.  Their wide-eyed expectations of the adventure to follow contrast starkly with what really happened.  We know a lot about what happened to prisoners during the Nazi period; what makes this film so powerful is that many of these children experienced similar treatment at the hands of representatives of so-called 'democratic' nations.",1413417600,,2693,5.286384976525822

4508880,4,B004ZDY400,"There's a wonderfully written, well documented  book called White Cargo which covers 170 years, beginning in the Elizabethan period, when poor British subjects were deported to the colonies to work as 'indentured servants' but were often treated worse than African slaves, since they had not been paid for. Few outlived the terms their indenture because starvation, beatings, rapes and other tortures were commonplace. Many of the transported were children, orphaned, or  kidnapped from big cities and had very short lifespans, particularly if they had the misfortune to end up in the tobacco fields of the new world.

Sadly, Britain returned to that policy in the post war era, with social services imposing their will on the poor or unwed and shipping confiscated children abroad instead of spending funds to care for them at home. Unfortunately once the children arrived at their destinations instead of being adopted they were [ again ] used as slave labor.

This film recounts the story of a brave English social worker who discovers and exposes such cases in Australia after she is contacted by a woman who is searching for her birth mother. Once again the Catholic church shows up as the most inhumane of charities -and even if you thought the Magdalene laundries were heinous, nothing will prepare you for the neglect and shocking abuses, physical, mental, sexual and emotional that these children lived through at the hands of the 'Holy Bothers' and other incredibly predatory adults.

Emily Watson plays the social worker as a model of restraint and tireless good will. Rather than being emotionally subdued, she beautifully 'holds space' for the adult survivors as they relive their harrowing stories, knowing that there is nothing one can do or say to make the trauma and pain go away or the victim feel better, until she herself begins to suffer from post traumatic disorder. Reads as a docudrama but is an important story with a terrific cast of supporting players. Well worth seeing.",1398988800,5,1998,5.060790273556231

Her role is key & she's a master of understatement --letting her face and eyes blaze when she realizes the real truth about what these 2 governments did to 130,000 children. She does not play a ""super-woman"" but plainly shows what true grit & a determination to find some justice can achieve. The movie is like Emily -- sturdy on top with layers of fire below.

It's based on the real life drama surrounding these deportations, uncovered by Margaret Humphreys, a British social worker. The deportations, as you will discover from reading her book, involved other countries as well. I first heard of these when reading the book, The Shipping News, in which one character's father had been a ""Home Boy,"" deported from Great Britain to Canada.

 I have watched this movie several times already and have shown it to my adult son who was as deeply affected as I was. I have recommended it to all my friends. What impressed me the most was Mrs. Humphreys' insistence on not blaming the organizations involved but encouraging them to help support the reunification of these now adults with their families back in England.

Although I have highlighted the understated tone of the movie, the heartbreaking stories of these children's upbringing in Australia, not in adopted homes but in institutions, will move you to tears.",1368576000,,1157,5.1436170212765955

I couldn't believe the UK government would have the audacity to round up children of their country, tell them their parents were dead, and send them to Australia.  Many were sent into environments which were abusive.  It was a deceitful plan from the beginning, and one which many children did not recover from.  They lost their family ties and many grew up not knowing ""who they were"", and that they were loved by their parents.  Many parents did not have the money to spend tracking down their children; unfortunate kids.  My mind was boggled, when at the end of the movie it stated that 130,000 children were kidnapped by the government.  That is crazy!!!!!  Who in their right mind would even conceive of such a stupid idea!!!!!  This God-sent woman and her husband should be given the highest medal the UK can offer, to spend so much of their time reconnecting these children-now-adults with their bloodline families.

It moves very quickly at the beginning though and is stagnant at this undetermined point for the rest of the movie, then lack a conclusion. I don't mean the kind with a bow on it; I mean one that expands the story, or shows the real changes Margaret makes. It just ends on a bit of a dud scene. I wanted to see a point where Margaret makes a real movement among either the people of England or a shift in Parliament or even just stops traveling every two weeks to Australia/England.

I know that many reviewers added that they were glad it didn't focus on her personal family life and did emphasize the stories. Personally, I wish they had delved into the family issues this caused too. It's a whole movie about abandonment, and Margaret seems to really abandon her family too. I don't know how accurate this is to her personal history, but it just seemed far-fetched that it wasn't more resolved.

Margaret Humphries (Emily Watson) is a social worker that discovers one of the best kept secrets of the British government. During the 50's thousands of children were taken away from their parents and sent to labor camps in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Affrica. This movie only deals with the situation in Australia. The movie is very well done and Emily Watson is outstanding in her role. I personally think that the movie is well done and shows the raw emotions of the people who got severely damaged by the British government.

This is a true story for which the British and Australian governments have apologized to the children in 2010, but the arrogant liberal Canadians who still think they know better, through their PM said in 2009 that they will not apologize. Below is the pathetic statement of the Canadian government through Jason Kinney who is still the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism (...sic) who apparently recognizes bad things only when there is public interest:

""There's no need for Canada to apologize for abuse and exploitation suffered by thousands of poor children shipped here from Britain starting in the nineteenth century ... the issue has not been on the radar screen here, unlike Australia where there's been a long-standing interest. The reality is that, here in Canada, we are taking measures to recognize that sad period, but there is, I think, limited public interest in official government apologies for everything that's ever been unfortunate or [a] tragic event in our history.""

You should read the story of ""home children"" that started in 1869. Annie MacPherson and Mary Rye started the entire ""slavery"" procedure. They thought they are doing the right thing. They took the children from the poor families and send them to labor camps in Australia where they suffered unspeakable horrors. Most of the adults today still try to recover from the horrors they suffered when they were young.

It is a must see! Five stars all around. Emily Watson is just outstanding.",1358035200,,2077,5.043731778425656
4508906,5,B004ZDY400,"I chose this movie because of the ratings and customer reviews shown and that Emily Watson was in it.  I had never heard of the movie, but most importantly I had never heard this true story about children being migrated from England to Australia, without approval from their parents.  The outrageous treatments they received once in Australia, molestation, lack of clothing and coats in cold climate, being used as slaves more or less doing physical labor, growing up thinking their families didn't want them, and always wondering why they gave them up and wanting to know more about their family.  Emily Watson, as well as the other actors, did a great job portraying the emotions they each went through.  Again, had never heard of this part of history, and it opened my eyes to it, and the suffering it caused.  What is so shocking is that is was Catholic priests who performed these atrocities, and the living conditions, lying to them about why they were there, keeping them from their families.

They were then assigned to a Catholic agency which would eventually send them to Australia to serve as child labourers under some of the most apalling circumstances. The film picks up the story later when many of the children have become adults and had returned to Britain to look for their parents and get answers as to why they were forced to suffer such cruelty. While there are many examples in modern history where children were sent to other lands as orphans - the Barnardo children come to mind - nothing even remotely equals the disgust and criminality associated with this conspiracy to help the state get rid of 'unwanted' children while lining the pockets of the Catholic church. It took the efforts of one very courageous social worker in the nineteen eighties to blow the lid of this very deep dark scheme that destroyed the childhood of many. This film speaks eloquently to the need to let wrongdoing go unchecked, even it means putting one's life in jeopardy. I am reminded once again of the hypocritical lengths public and religions institutions will go to cover up wrong-doing in the interests of what they believe is a higher cause. Even though the government finally got around to apologizing for the mental anguish and physical abuse caused in this illegal removal of children from their natural homes, little could be done to restore them to a loving relationship.",1355616000,2,1580,4.943609022556391

The story is set in the 1980s where Nottingham, social worker Margaret Humphreys (Emily Watson) is a social worker who encounters a middle aged woman who has traveled from Australia to find her birth parents. Margaret at first doesn't want to increase her workload with a wild tale of children having been deported form England by ship to be placed in orphanage work camps in Australia, but with the aid of her supportive husband Merv (Richard Dillane) she begins to investigate the uncovered secret, ultimately traveling to Australia where she meets the `unwanted children' as adults each longing to return to the UK to meet their families. The children when deported were as young as four to thirteen years old and had been told their parents either were dead or didn't want them and the representatives from the government promised them a safe home with `oranges and sunshine' in Australia. There are several `victims' as played by Hugo Weaving, David Wenham, Russell Dykstra and others who help personalize the unspoken crime until Margaret progresses to the point where she can hold the British government accountable for child migration schemes and reunite the children involved -- now adults living mostly in Australia -- with their parents in Britain. Though the deportations occurred from the 1940's through the 1970's it was only after Margaret Humphrey's 1994 book and then much later after when February 2010 Great Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown finally issued a full apology to those deported children and their families.

It was a shock, therefore, to learn that British authorities removed children from their homes and shipped them elsewhere as late as the 1970s. Someone in authority determined that a child's family was unfit and removed them  (without a hearing) and then sent them away to--wait for it--Australia. As adults some of these children made their way back to Britain to try to relocate their parents. They were fortunate to stumble upon a social worker, Margaret Humphries, who was willing to help.  The movie shows the struggles she had with with governmental authorities as she tried to reunite adult children with their families. The movie is very understated and lacks the warm fuzzy aspects of a Hallmark special. Some children did receive a happy ending but many did not. What happened to these children was shocking and Mrs Humphries suffered greatly for having revealed the sordid secrets of these children. Because of its simple straight forward storytelling, the feel of realism increase as does the wallop it possesses.

4508930,5,B004ZDY400,"WOW ... This is an incredible, powerful, moving and gripping story (based on true events, and the book ""Empty Cradles"" by Margaret Humphreys).

When you watch this movie you need to be in the mood for something like Schindler's list or the like.  This is NOT lighthearted ""entertainment"".

In 1986 this story was uncovered by chance as one of these deported children returned (as an adult) to Great Britain desperately in search of who she really was, and happens upon social worker Margaret Humphreys. She tells Margaret that when she was a little girl she and hundreds of other kids were shipped from Great Britain to Australia, etc.  Margaret finds her story hard to believe, and more or less blows it off because how could this happen en mass.  Then another woman in a support group Margaret runs for adopted people mentions a lost brother who'd found her - who claimed the same deportation story.  Margaret begins looking into it and whoa tidal wave - this didn't happen to just a FEW kids it happened to over 130,000 children!  The kids aged 5-13 were shipped off, and told they had nobody and were nobody and were given an incredibly hard life (that's an understatement).  This happened in the 1940's through the 1970's (I think I have that span right)...  Decades after the news of this got out (in February 2010), Great Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown finally issued a full apology to those deported children and their families.

Margaret listens to each of the deported children's stories and their memories, for as much information as she can gather on them in order to help them find out who they are, and find their families.  By doing this, she herself ends up with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder just from absorbing their pain - being strong for them.  But she doesn't quit - even when physically threatened.  She is all they've got.  Their stories are incredible - even as understated as this movie was.

At the end of the movie it says that Margaret is STILL helping these deported children find out who they are today.  She is incredible! (And so is her very supportive husband!)

The telling of the story and some of the history of the English Home Children program. The acting was fairly good as was the cinematography. Humphreys' dogged investigation and the Aussie role was a centerpiece in this docudrama based on her book ""Empty Cradles"".

Negatives:
Too little factuality and too much tabloid drama.
The extent of the program going back over 100 years and involving children estimated up to several hundred thousand seems to have gotten lost. Even the the more recent (mid-twentieth century)  numbers of close to 150,000 seemed to have gotten lost in this movie's rendition. The extent of the deportations (placements?) over so many Commonwealth countries also seems to have been excluded from the script. Given the numbers and countries involved, a more factual accounting on the diverse backgrounds of the children; naming the government, church and organizations involved; the various reasons behind the program and above all their treatment once deported (although, in typical Sun tabloid fashion, a lot of script attention was focused on abused children).
The film needed to tell us more about the final resolution such as the process of identifying the children; searching for them and their compensation.

4508933,5,B004ZDY400,"""Oranges and Sunshine"" is a drama film based on the work of English social worker Margaret Humphreys who discovers the practice of British child deportation to Australia and Canada.

Many of the children were sent to Australia following World War II and up until the early 1990s. These children often came from single parent homes or circumstances where their parents had difficulty supporting a family, and the children were placed in temporary government care, but unknown to their parents and relatives the children were sent overseas. This practice became known as the ""Home Children"" scandal.

The narrative exposes the misrepresentation of a new and wonderful life that the children were promised in Australia and how both the British and Australian Governments coordinated the activity, which wasn't disclosed to the public whilst the deportations were taking place.

The film draws attention to the lives that the children faced in Australia and the tenacious efforts of Humphreys to help them try and find resolution.

It is a quality movie with an impressive cast of British and Australian actors. Emily Watson (Margaret Humphreys), Hugo Weaving (Jack), and David Wenham (Len) provide a moving performance.
