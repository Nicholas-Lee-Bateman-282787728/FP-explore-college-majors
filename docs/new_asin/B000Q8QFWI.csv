8195163,5,B000Q8QFWI,"During the 1970s and 80s, Styx was one of the most popular American rock bands, and the lead singer was Dennis DeYoung.  Today, Dennis has started touring with a 70-piece orchestra and has given a unique new sound to many of the Styx favorites.

This fine DVD shows Dennis in concert with the orchestra, and I was blown away at how good these songs sound with the orchestral insturments.  Dennis' melodic tenor voice made the great Styx songs sound so good, and his voice continues to shine through on the songs included on this DVD.  Such favorites as ""The Grand Illusion"", ""Lady"", and ""Lorelei"" are included, as well as the show tunes ""Ave Maria"" and ""With Every Heartbeat"".  The children's choir of Chicago add their vocal talents as well.

I've been a Styx fan for many years, and since Dennis left the band, they haven't sounded the same.  Although the group continues to tour, they sound nothing like they did when Dennis was singing.  Its nice to see that Dennis has kept his songs alive and made them even better by adding the orchestra.

I give this DVD my absolute highest recommendation.  True Styx fans will be delighted to hear Dennis DeYoung once again performing his greatest hits.",1199664000,7,1196,4.706730769230769
