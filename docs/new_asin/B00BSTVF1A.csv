5670253,2,B00BSTVF1A,"Fortunately my girlfriend and I started this movie after a couple glasses of wine. The IMDb and Amazon ratings had us scratching our heads immediately. This film crosses the line from campy to awkward, but it is like watching a train wreck; we found ourselves captivated despite our horror.

Where to start... There is the issue of ""acting"". The characters deliver their lines in a horribly scripted manner. We debated whether the flattened affect was deliberate (for the sake of the actors we hope so).

The movie peaked during the first few minutes with the man in the floral wing chair giving the warning about the riverbeast. From there it was downhill. The cast of characters have brutally fictitious names. The vocabulary was forced and pretentious. It was as if the script was written with reference to a SAT-prep book.

However where else could we learn the many uses of kitty litter? The music was shockingly tolerable and cued us in to critical moments. The riverbeast itself was intentionally not scary, yet somehow fascinating (world's most ineffective claws, etc).

Bottom line is that the movie does provide entertainment. Also the 99-min length really sells this flick. You don't have that much to lose, but make sure you realize that you are investing nearly two hours of your life. This movie would also make a pretty decent drinking game... take a drink every time they say riverbeast or rb!",1385769600,8,1409,4.907563025210084
5670254,5,B00BSTVF1A,"The team that brought us ""Monsters, Marriage, and Murder in Manchvegas"" and ""Freaky Farley"" have done it again! This edition of family-friendly, New England horror features a classic water monster and plenty of laughs. Fans of William Castle-esque horror will love it!

FYI, Amazon Instant Video says that the movie is 40 minutes long. It's actually 99 minutes.",1379548800,7,361,5.224137931034483
8573358,5,B00BSTVF1A,"I'm stunned by all the negative reviews.  Don't Let the Riverbeast Get You is a *mockery* of a horror film- not an actual legitimate horror film!  Approach it from a mockery/parody point of view and you'll see it in a new light, believe me.  As a mockery it's quite good too!  If you turn the movie off after 20 minutes it's probably because you're expecting a horror film and will conclude it's just terribly written and poorly acted, but it's all done intentionally.  40 minutes in the movie improves in a big way.  I get the feeling people aren't used to watching parody horror movies nowadays.  Perhaps they went out of style and this movie brought the genre back, who knows.

I think the description is probably misleading most people since it doesn't specify Don't Let the Riverbeast Get You is a comedy/mockery so it's easy for people to think they're expecting a legitimate horror.  It's about a tutor named Neil Stuart who is assigned to work with a young female student.  She gets bored and distracted easily by her school work so he's here to help bring out her potential.  During the early parts of the movie it's easy to think the acting is really bad based on the way these character interact with each other, but trust me, it's done that way on purpose to add to the mockery.

Neil bumps into his old girlfriend... who's now involved with another guy.  He takes exception to Neil's presence by punching him in the stomach.  Ouch!  Neil visits his mom's home where a guy still lives in the basement.  Never really found out if this person is Neil's brother or someone else, but they don't get along for a while.  Since the movie's a mockery the way they wrestle on the floor is purposely bad!  I love it.

Turns out a Riverbeast is running around.  The narrator in the beginning warns that whenever the Riverbeast appears the screen will flash red, and sure enough that's what happens.  Every time!  It adds to the campiness of the film.  The writing is just so funny, but you have to pay close attention to the way these characters speak to each other.  It's overdramatic and campy on purpose.  The way they respond to each other is slow on purpose.  And the soundtrack?  My goodness I love the soundtrack!  I think the person who made it is incredible.  We constantly hear music the whole time which is a major plus.  It always adds to the supposed horror taking place, but even if you were to ignore the story and listen to just the music, you'd hear one super melodic theme after another.  A truly awesome soundtrack in every sense.  And the punk and new wave tunes we hear along the way are just as awesome.

The mockery is neverending.  Granted it takes a while for the story to get going, and for some of us to figure out how to interpret the movie.  A reporter named Sparky Watts sets out to destroy Neil's reputation since he's apparently not welcomes back in this town after his false Riverbeast spottings.  How about the guy playing guitar on the sidewalk?  He meets a woman who says she's a vagabond and reveals the brilliance of kitty litter.  It deodorizes camping gear, absorbs spills, absorbs sweaty palms and melts ice.  She gets itchy feet and the guitarist recommends just putting kitty litter on her feet, lol.  This is just one of MANY hilarious lines.  How about later when a woman pulls over to let her husband use the bathroom.  He walks into the woods and his wife yells at him.  He returns a moment later and says ""I have to walk deep in the woods or I'll be arrested for indecent exposure"".  The way he says it, and the timing... he deliberately waits an extra few seconds to pop out of the weeds and answer his wife's question.  Little moments like this, of which they are many, are pure gold.  I actually think the timing's off a tad just to assure viewers are able to catch the humor between each line.

Meanwhile the girl the tutor's helping has a strict athletic father.  I had a feeling looking at his big arms he'd play a bigger part later, and he sure does.  He wrestles the Riverbeast later on.  There's also a professor who spends more of his time spying on girls sunbathing than looking for the appearance of the Riverbeast.  He and the girl Neil's tutoring often get into feuds and he becomes known as the disgraced deviant.  I love it, but I especially love how the girl doesn't really care that he's a pervert and makes fun of him.  The girl has this way of never being serious regardless of the situation and it's awesome.  And how about the scene with the old man and Neil in the woods?  Neil asks about the Riverbeast, but the conversation turns and ends awkwardly with the man telling Neil that he needs to work on his communication skills (with women if I recall). Neil just walks away, lol!  An Arrested Development-like moment for sure.

The Riverbeast itself is actually quite scary.  It's hard to feel a true sense of fear in a mockery movie of course, but had this been an actual horror film it would've been quite the intimidating creature!  Anyway the Riverbeast has no eyes apparently (actually looking at the cover he does have eyes!) but walks like a human with a huge open mouth and sharp teeth.  He attacks by smacking his fins around and using branches to stab people.  Not very nice!  Turns out the chemical compounds of kitty litter can dry out the Riverbeast's skin, thus rendering it deceased.  You have to try this kitty litter stuff for real!

Anytime a fight scene happens the movie makes it clear it's not to be taken seriously.  The professor getting smacked on by Neil, or Sparky Watts getting smacked around by Neil (and Neil's not a very violent person!)  Or the fight with the Riverbeast the many characters get into.  I enjoy it all!  The whole movie is terrific.  The segment at the end is great.  Neil promises to take care of his girlfriend's kid, and while giving a speech he goes out of his way to mention that even though the kid has a different dad he'll be treated like his own.  This kid having a different father is also hilariously mentioned earlier at the wedding between the girlfriend and the guy who punched Neil early on for hitting on his girlfriend.

Just a classic and highly recommended... as a mockery or parody.  Not as an actual horror.",1499299200,,6246,4.5125

8573363,4,B00BSTVF1A,"""Don't Let The Riverbeast Get You!"" is a comedic homage to B-movies of yesteryear aimed squarely at Larry Blamire's core audience. While this is not in the same league as ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" it is still amusing in its own extremely low budget way. I really enjoyed the flashback to Criswell and ""Plan 9"" at the outset which set the tone properly with the helpful ""Riverbeast Alert"" viewing system. That it is extremely low budget is of little consequence; audiences of this genre are prepared for that, and are likewise prepared for the terrible acting and awful accents on full display here.

The film has some great moments: the opening theme song is wonderful, the explanation of why butternut squash is hard to share is a funny micro plotpoint, and the concept of the hero being a poetry tutor was truly original. I was perhaps most taken by the offbeat kitty litter subplot and associated dancing in the Rivertown, USA park. The dance to ""Wild Thing"" is genuinely exceptional. There is also a noteworthy casserole tossing subplot, which is a sentence I never thought I would have a need to write. I don't want to give away the story, but let's just say that there is strife, interpersonal conflict, romance, old scores to settle, a band called ""The River Mud Warriors"" whose reunion and song ""The River Mud Shuffle"" must be seen to be truly appreciated, and a Riverbeast which seems to hug and gently massage its victims to death. It's almost too much for a heroic poetry tutor to handle, but with the help of a hobo with a heart and a knapsack full of kitty litter, justice and peace return to Rivertown, USA. Brilliant!

The DVD includes a worthless behind the scenes feature, some so-so bloopers, and a music video by ""Dying Elk Herd."" The commentary track discusses how the film was largely made in Salem, MA and Manchester, NH, and is mostly interesting, though features a distracting prerecorded long distance interview technique at points that tends to be off-putting.

If you like old monster movies, cult movies, bad movies, spoofs, or satires and you don't mind bottom-of-the-barrel acting and production values, you should give ""Don't Let The Riverbeast Get You!"" a try.",1432771200,2,2197,4.822281167108753
8573364,4,B00BSTVF1A,"Mostly due to a stand out performance by writer and star Matt Farley, the film does have a certain charm. The town of Rivertown is populated with a wacky assortment of characters, all of which seem to think that Neil Stuart aka RB is a total loser. he sticks to his guns and eventually saves the day. Other notable performances are Sharon Scalzo as Allie Stone and Bryan Fortin as Troy Kiel. The film benefits largely due to a great New England in autumn location. The old time use of a ""fear flasher"" to warn of Riverbeast appearances is both charming and campy. The main draw back is the film has a running time of 99 minutes but you could skip an hour ten minutes if you're just here for the Beast. That being said, the Beast is a great costume in the tradition of Paul Blaisdell and would be worthy of any drive in movie screen. A fun time.",1408147200,2,844,4.28125

8573367,4,B00BSTVF1A,"This homage to 1950's and 60's B monster movies is an enjoyable little romp, but you have to be of the inclined to like really, really bad old monster movies.  This is not quite the hilarious parody of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"", but it is obvious that this movie is made by people who enjoyed those B-movies and are familiar with the slow pacing, padding, cheese monster suits (with visible zippers), and acting so wooden you could it to build a mansion.  It is all here, characters making stupid decisions, character reactions to situations that would never fly in the real world, and dialog so stilted that it sounds like someone received a new Thesaurus for  Christmas.  The only distracting problem about the movie is that the cinematography is actually too good for the type of movie, there are actually some beautiful shots of filming locations.  I especially loved the overdubbed scene with the tutor and the student in the city (a city I might add that seems to change from a small town to a moderate metropolis at the drop of a hat).
If you want a good monster movie, look somewhere else.  If you want to relive your childhood of watching bad movies, this is your movie.
The reason for the review title, the last scene of the movie features a memorial/celebration with a statue that screams no-budget.  I do not remember ever seeing such a statue ever being used in an old B-movie (usually they mention it and not show it).  Kudos go to not only the actors in that scene, but also to the crew who had to be there to tape it.",1402272000,2,1538,4.5071942446043165
