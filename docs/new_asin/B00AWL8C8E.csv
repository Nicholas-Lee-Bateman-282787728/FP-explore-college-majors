8558462,4,B00AWL8C8E,"It took me a while to get up the courage to try this video because I was afraid it was going to be too hard and becasue you have to make sure you have the right props..step, dumbbells, workout ball. (So check ahead for what you need before starting any of the workouts :). Well, it is hard!! But I really liked the workouts, including the warm up and cool down segments! I think the instructors are easy to follow, and I love that they offer modifications for easier or more advanced versions of the exercises. I really liked Cardio Blast (challenging!) and Tone Your Hips and Lower-Body Toning. If you a 2-3 of these and include Cardio Blast, it's a pretty complete workout. I'm happy with my $5 investment.",1387756800,,708,4.453846153846154
