8527780,5,B0047PF7KC,My husband and I watched this documentary last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! We particularly enjoyed the perspective of the local citizens and local enforcment (especially Sheriff Estrada) which brought the subject right into our living room.  We've been talking about it ever since and keep coming back to it.,1295222400,,313,5.26

I've seen some other documentary videos on the border and the wall, but this one really does the best job at highlighting and focusing on what it's like for those who live on the border. Well done documentary featuring policy issues, real Americans, and environmental struggles.  The film maker strives and succeeds in the portrayal of this difficult topic.  Highly recommended.",1294617600,,501,4.940476190476191
