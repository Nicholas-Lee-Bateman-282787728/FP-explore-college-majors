8153616,4,B000JYXMWA,"These are NOT Communist cartoons.  They are pro-Capitalist cartoons from early in the Cold War.  They explain how Capitalism works and why it made the USA the greatest country in the world.  As close as they come to anti-Communism is ""Make Mine Freedom,"" in which a huckster tries to pitch ""ISM"" in a bottle to a farmer, a worker, and a business owner.  They are all by the same studio and are drawn in the same cartoon style.  Still in all they are not bad, especially if you need a historic visual to explain what hegemony means.",1237939200,5,531,4.43298969072165
8153617,4,B000JYXMWA,"What you get is good - the title ""Anti-Communist"" is a BIT misleading.  The cartoons are mostly teaching about how capitalism works, and why it is good.  None of the cartoons mentions ""Communism"" specifically, although one indirectly refers to it, in the form of an evil called ""ISM"".  It is clear to a student of history that these cartoons are meant as an indirect criticism of communism, but it would have been nice of they were a bit more pointed and rabidly anti-red, so that my History students could get the Cold War feel as they watch.  But overall, definitely worth the price.",1235952000,5,585,4.650485436893204
