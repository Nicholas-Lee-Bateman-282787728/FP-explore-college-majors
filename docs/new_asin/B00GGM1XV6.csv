6075226,3,B00GGM1XV6,It was a fun addition to the series. Some genuinely funny moments and lots of fun murdering death stuffs.,1406764800,,105,4.578947368421052
6075227,5,B00GGM1XV6,"This is not a serious movie! If your like me and you like to have some beer and watch something fun without a need for blockbuster notoriety than buy this. I liked the dance party at the end and it sums up the vibe of the whole show. B horror rocks,keep it coming!!",1404691200,,265,4.018867924528302
6075228,1,B00GGM1XV6,"the 3d was not good.  no..wait it sucked.  the movie was almost as bad. I'd say it might be a student movie.  I don't believe it was even blue ray because it looked like, 'my bloody valentine's standard dvd released in 3d.  bloody valentine looks pretty good in blue ray 3d.  it is a crime to sell this movie.",1401494400,,309,4.169491525423729
6075229,3,B00GGM1XV6,"I was eager to see the results when a new crop of lo-fi filmmakers decide to shoot something ""in the mother****ng third dimension, as God intended.""  I'm pleased to announce the results are worthy for fans of lo-fi horror and probably slasher films in general.

While the original Porkchop and Porkchop II have little to tie the stories together, Porkchop 3D does a good job of bringing back characters from both the previous installments (as well as actors in other roles).  I'd recommend viewing all three, but they get progressively better and the original spends a lot of time setting up character drama before the killer arrives.  A lot.  Not so here, where murder and nudity proceeds at a pretty steady pace.

The technical aspects have improved too, which, this time, includes the use of 3-D.  While I would've preferred the camera be moved back a few feet in almost every setup, the Sony camera (an HDR-TD10, according to the credits) seems to be pretty foolproof in delivering watchable images.  The tight framing causes some violations of the viewing frustrum, but overall the sensation of depth is compelling and consistent.

The disc is not a BD3D but is presented in side-by-side (SBS) format.  That may present a minor inconvenience for some viewers, but it's not a problem in general.

Compared to the previous wave of lo-fi 3-D movies (Camp Blood, Hunting Season, etc.), this one looks a lot better (mostly due to technological advancement in camcorders) and probably lands near the high end of the stories of those movies, especially if you've seen the other Porkchops.

I rate it three stars as a recommendation for fans of either slasher or lo-fi horror films with an appreciation of the other.  (Four would be a recommendation for all slasher or lo-fi fans.  Five would be a universal recommendation.)",1401148800,3,1821,4.908496732026144
6075230,5,B00GGM1XV6,"Pork Chop continues for a third time.  For me this is always exciting news.  Eamon Hardiman is one of my absolute favorite independent slash underground filmmakers.  First off let me just say that as an avid collector and addict of the indie movie world That the Pork Chop series is top notch.  I was in awe of the first, loved the 2nd, and 3D is just gory greatness.  Punching death, pick through the lower jaw and ripped out, eyeball poked out, and one woman is hung then gutted.
  Eamons humor is all over the place.  First off we have repeating character Burt Fleming who once again shows his face and snide comments to a Razor Sharp film.  I lose it everytime I see him not to mention Shawn Phillips introduces the movie who is another indie actor favorite of mine.
The effects in this movie were some of the best I have ever seen from one of Eamon's movies.  Most especially the jaw rip scene.  More kills I won't go into but don't go in expecting Tom Savini one the main issues I have with reviewers on sites like this is their complete lack of viewing experience in the indie world.  These aren't hundreds of thousands or millions or even tens of thousand dollar movies.  For me the fx were over the top given the budget restrictions.  Thank you once again Mr.  Hardiman for making a great forest slasher flick and making it right.
  If gory funny forest freak sort of thing is what you want then go Pork Chop.  Be on the lookout for a spin off movie yet to come Pig Girl.  Highly reccomended if your a fan of indie films especially.",1398211200,9,1541,4.362676056338028
6075231,5,B00GGM1XV6,"This is a film for all of the depraved and kind of ""off"" members of the horror community... Your modern hipster horror ""aficionado"" of refined taste may not connect with all of the nudity, gore, pig head wearing mongoloid inbred father-daughter rape and murder duo of the Porkchop films... and it wasn't made for that crowd anyway. This is a film for gorehounds, Tromaheads, sick bastards, and people who prefer the manic stylings of a film like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Pt. 2 over its predecessor. This one is for the trolls... and it's glorious.",1398211200,6,550,4.8

6075235,1,B00GGM1XV6,I'm amazed at what a pile of crap this movie is. I knew it was going to be campy but really it was just a pile of crap with a rape scene thrown in to make it sadly offensive.,1390348800,6,174,3.4871794871794872
8622791,3,B00GGM1XV6,"Now comes a movie review which will let you know that I will sit down and watch (or at least try) anything.

Porkchop 3D - This movie appears only to be available direct from the ""studio"" through Amazon. It comes signed by two people (I am not sure by who because I couldn't read the two signatures). It doesn't appear to be available at Amazon at the moment but it may be because they are pressing more. This comes on a BD-R with a cheap white label with an ink smeared ""Porkchop 3D."" The case art looks very good and appears they put more time into it than the disc label.

Okay, first things first. I enjoy watching movies that are so bad they are good and I also have a lot of respect for people who go out and try to make movies (especially horror) on a nothing budget and then make it fairly enjoyable to watch. I have several friends who have done this locally and I have even appeared in some movies like this (cameo only...no interest in acting). I was also fun to help with the production and be behind the scenes. So again, my tolerance for movies like this is extremely higher than the average viewer.

I went into this knowing nothing about the Porkchop character and believe it or not, it is a trilogy with at least one spin-off movie. Who knew? The credits at the end state the movie was made with a Sony HDR-TD10 camera, for $3000 and with lots of volunteers. Very impressive.

Okay, on with the film review. The movie actually delivers. It knows what it is and doesn't shy away from it. It has a bunch of tits, a lot of practical gore effects (that are all mostly well done), and lots of smart-aleck kids spouting off wacky dialogue with humor that often will make you laugh out loud...intentionally! And all the kids make decisions that are so non-nonsensical, you wonder how they are even breathing. But more importantly for this review...the 3D. It is actually well done and extremely strong. So strong you may want to grab the barf bag (and not because of the gore).

The director, for whatever reason, decided to shoot half of the movie's scenes in extreme close-up. It is a bizarre choice (if intentional) and doesn't work. It hinders a lot of the 3D because the depth is crazy strong on this. My projector didn't auto detect it so I had to manually choose the ""side by side"" option (and the movie actually comes with an instruction slip inside to do just that). There are several pop-outs and again, very nice looking depth. The color palette is really bland but I think that was due mostly to the camera. It certainly wasn't a directorial decision since this is obviously a point and click film.

There are times where the framing is atrocious in addition to the close-ups. You can see heavy reflections on the sides of the picture that may wreak havoc on your eyes. But get past a lot of these issues and again, some very nice depth in a lot of it.

Now for the important parts...the tits and gore. Tits are more important to me than gore so let's start with those. This movie has a lot of no-reason nudity (which is my favorite) but the girls range from fours to sevens. Most of the practical gore is extremely well done with several pop-outs pertaining to the kills. There is a ton of graphic language (a lot of it is way over the top) but this is mainly from a couple of actors that can't seem to say a line without a cuss word every second. It doesn't bother me but when I notice it, it may bug some since I am basically immune.

And believe it or not, you get the pleasure of a talking robot in action. Yep. This robot is straight out of Filmation's Space Academy but with more personality and less movement, if you can image that. Where can you find all of the above in one film and in 3D?!?! Only here! Exciting!

Movie - ***1/2 out of ***** (Based upon the budget, tits and gore and all around ridiculousness. It actually earned an extra half star just for a scene when two guys get lost in the woods. Look for it.)

3D - ****1/2 out of ***** (A lot of flaws in the presentation but you have to respect what they were able to accomplish on the cheap. Mr. Director...just please let the camera breath a little. Way to many extreme close-ups.)",1452902400,2,4175,4.354755784061696
