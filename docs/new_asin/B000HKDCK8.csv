8140161,5,B000HKDCK8,"This Swan Lake DVD is just simply riveting!
I keep several varieties of 'Swan Lake' covering mainly the Russian and Germany products and a few others.
I tend to favour the heart and not the brain approach.
I find this dvd stands proudly above all the others for a variety of reasons:-
1/ The music is vibrant - 2/ the dancing, especially in Act 3 is just 'mind blowing' - 3/ the stage has a curtain and settings that totally focus on the mood, and emotional depth of this 'never to be forgotten' ballet - 4/ The performance of the ""Court Jester""  is almost a show in itself! - 5/  Rothband, the evil magician was the best evil thing on two legs that I have seen - 6/ and Odette the swan princess, was just perfect in every way.

I have only one word left in me after I have seen it, yet again and again - and that is ""Encore,encore, encore!!"".",1350691200,,843,4.191358024691358
8140162,4,B000HKDCK8,"This is a good version of Swan Lake becuase the supporting Ballet dancers are excellent: Polina Kirova and Luidmilla D., etc. But the main Prima Ballerina Marina R. is not very good. She does an average job and is not as good as Svetlana Z. Moscow Classical Ballet Corps are very good.",1296172800,,285,4.5
8140163,4,B000HKDCK8,"First off, I really do enjoy this performance, but it is enjoyable for vivacity and over-all excellence even if there is no dancer who is truly stellar.  Or to put it another way, everyone is very good but no one is great.  That's the bad news and the good news, all in one.  The choreography mercifully reins in the late 20th century part of the odious Jester; he's still there, but he isn't intrusive.  On the other hand, Benno is back (thankfully), apparently having been called back from choreographic exile and takes his rightful place in Act One (even if he does mysteriously disappear in Act Three - more exile?).  The Odette/Odile is gorgeous - she really is - and she dances very well.  There is however a level of excellence above her; you need to know that, because it's the truth.  She is somewhat better, I think, as Odile (though others mark out the differences between the two characters much more sharply); her Odette is somewhat taxed by the long line of the adagio nature of the part.  And she tends to break the part into small segments, when they need to flow seamlessly.

Her Prince is also technically good without being great; for him too there exists another level to which he as yet does not attain.  That's just the way it is.  He executes well, but he does not act deeply.  He has been told what to do and when, but he has not internalized any of it.  He is gifted (or cursed) with a long neck; but he seems to have a steel rod  up his spine from his hips to his medulla and thus hasn't the grace required of a danseur noble.

The costumes are sometimes reminiscent of the 1920's - as though Rambova and Nazimova were with us again - yet without being camp.  It's very odd - but also rather beautiful.

The lighting for Acts Two and Four is too strong and direct; the lake scenes need a bit of haze and mist to be truly effective.  And overall their stage needs to be at the very least ten feet wider, preferably more; they seem to need to be careful not to bump into each other when the whole corps is engaged.  (I admit that that is scarcely their fault, and they cope with the spacial limitation very well; but it does have an empact.)

After all this, you might think I didn't like the performance, but that is not at all the case.  No matter what fault I found in particulars, I was actually convinced by the whole and really did like it - and will watch it again.  It has a vitality which carries the day.  SO. . .don't hesitate to buy it.  It may not qualify as truly great, but that doesn't mean you won't appreciate and be glad you saw it.  Life is like that sometimes!",1289347200,3,2605,4.299794661190965
8140164,5,B000HKDCK8,"This has become the DVD that both I (age 50) and by daughter (age 3) most like to watch. Everybody knows Tchaikovsky's great score, but this performance by the Moscow classical Ballet is marvelous. The prima ballerina, Marina Rzhannikova, is something to behold: endless, flawless legs; a face to kill for with huge fiery eyes. Her dancing is fluid and especially the movements of her arms seem to go beyond what human anatomy allows. She dances like she means it. Contrary to what is the norm she appears to be quite tall too. Just very very beautiful. Her prince, Nikolay Chevychelov, is a good match. A serious, expressive, and tightly controlled bundle of strength. He dances in a lyrical manner I find quite becoming. The rest of the corps is very good too, with some splendid solo dancing. Not to mention the very joyful Russian and Spanish dances. Petipa's original choreography has been adapted with very good effect by the artistic directors Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasilyov. The costumes are beautiful but not distracting, the sets minimalist. This is great ballet.

Like most ballets on DVD here too the aspect ratio is only 4:3, and as always it's impossible to be quite happy with the cinematography. Still, I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. Just splendid. I wish there were more DVDs like this one coming from Russia.",1175472000,8,1346,4.9035087719298245
