8690034,1,B00Q2CZGZ4,Just terrible. She speaks so fast and rushes through the locations. Standing outside most locations isn't touring. No depth.,1527724800,,124,5.578947368421052
8690035,5,B00Q2CZGZ4,"I loved the DVD of Transylvania. I enjoy Europe and wanted to get a bit more information and enjoyment from Laura McKenzie's dvd. She did a great job and I loved it. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
thanks

8690040,1,B00Q2CZGZ4,"It's fitting that this video's longest segment consists of our hostess quipping about having to pee, poking buttons on an automated toilet, and then pressing her ear to the door while commenting (at great length) on the sounds the toilet made as it cleaned itself. Another useful tip was to go to a luxury designer's off-season store and ask whether the garments for sale were ""rejects."" The rest consisted of cursory glimpses of monuments, a bit of can-can dancing, and some lessons in embarrassing mispronunciation. If you're at all interested in Paris' art, culture, history, architecture, or any of the many other things that make it one of the great cities of the world, look elsewhere.",1483833600,7,691,4.9655172413793105
