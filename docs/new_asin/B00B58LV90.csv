5558017,5,B00B58LV90,I absolutely loved this drama. Of course I bought it for Donghae but I was really surprised with how good it was. The characters were great and I loved the super complicated story. I think the biggest reason for my 5 stars is for the portrayal of the grandpa/grandson relationship. It was really touching and acted well.,1387756800,3,320,4.631578947368421
5558018,5,B00B58LV90,The packaging for the dvds are pretty simple. But absolutely love it. It was interesting watching it with the Mandarin dub too (I got curious and watched it with the Mandarin dub). This drama NEVER fails to make me laugh.,1386201600,3,221,4.55
5558019,3,B00B58LV90,"Pan Da Yang, whose name sounds like ""panda,"" is the sweet, naive, but up-beat owner of a bakery, Cafe Panda. Ko Seung Ji, whose name is the shortened version of the word ""hedgehog,"" and has a cold, prickly personality, is a talented, new pastry chef Pan Da Yang hires.

Panda's bakery is on it's last leg and Hedgehog is its only hope of recovery. But Cafe Panda is a small bakery competing against an upscale national cake franchise business, Saint Honore, who doesn't play fair. The new owner (who is taking over his father's business) happens to be Choi Won II, a childhood friend of Panda's. And Panda's best friend is working for him. Now Panda and Hedgehog must work hard and overcome their differences to bring Cafe Panda success.

The reason Panda runs a bakery is because she hopes her childhood friend who disappeared one day will come to her bakery so they can meet again. Ko Seung Ji has no childhood memories and doesn't know who his family is. He was also in prison and had a tough time getting hired until he met Panda. He wanted to work at Saint Honore, but the owner rudely refused to hire him because of his background. He wants revenge on Saint Honore by opening his own bakery. He plans to take advantage of trusting, naive Panda and take over her bakery.

There are so many more secrets to be revealed and surprising twists and turns in this romantic comedy.

Donghae, from the K-pop group Super Junior, is the main actor, Ko Seung Ji, of the drama. That's how I ended up hearing about this show and I just had to watch it. He makes a good actor too.

Though it's a cute and funny drama and the characters are likable, there isn't a whole lot of excitement and the story at times got a bit dull. That's why I gave it 3 stars. This drama is definitely worth watching at least once though, especially if your a k-pop fan. (16 episodes/good English subs)",1385856000,,1872,4.446064139941691
5558020,5,B00B58LV90,"I received this and watched all 16 episodes in 3 days, however I am partial to Super Junior's Lee Donghae:)  While the story was typical cliche' Korean drama, it was well written and fun to watch and anyone who loves K-dramas will feel that it was worth the money, not like some of the dramas I buy where I wish I could get my money back.

I would recommend and will definitely watch this again.",1380585600,,395,4.253333333333333

8562720,5,B00B58LV90,"2012s Miss Panda and Hedgehog is a highly entertaining romantic drama. Super Juniors Lee Donghae shows his acting chops in the lead role, convincingly portraying complex character Go Seung-Ji, while Yoon Seung-Ah is endearing as love interest Pan Da-Yang. The well-paced plot easily weaves in moments of comedy, heartache and intrigue, and the twists and turns will keep you guessing right until the end. The highly engaging story and talented and attractive cast makes Miss Panda and Hedgehog a great introduction to K-drama for K-beginners; and with English, Chinese and Malay subtitles, and the dubbed Mandarin soundtrack alongside the original Korean soundtrack, this DVD is a must-have resource for serious language learners. Who says you cant have your cake and eat it too!",1403568000,3,779,5.341463414634147
