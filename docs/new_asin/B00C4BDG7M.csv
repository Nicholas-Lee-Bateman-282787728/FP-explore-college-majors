5690515,5,B00C4BDG7M,"I got a DVD copy of ""The Confession"" in exchange for my honest review. When I got the DVD, and compared the pictures to those on The Shunning DVD, I saw that the actress playing Katie Lapp had changed. That caused me a moment's hesitation, but once I watched the movie, all those doubts disappeared. Katie Leclerc did an excellent job of portraying Katie Lapp in her struggles to do the right thing.

This is an awesome, family-friendly movie. If you haven't watched ""The Shunning"" yet, you definitely need to watch that first to get the back story. Katie is on a mission to find her birth mother. She doesn't have much more than a name and general location, and she runs into opposition, including an imposter!

Even though I've read the books that these movies are based on, I found myself caught up in the movie, wondering what would happen next, how obstacles would be overcome, and how conflicts would be resolved. The movie went by very quickly, and left me saying ""What? It's over? I have to wait for the final movie now?""

The movie had a little bit of everything - humor, light romance, conflicts, suspense. I appreciate the way the main characters of Katie Lapp and Laura Mayfield-Bennett are such loveable characters, showing grace, kindness, loyalty and forgiveness to others.

There are several scenes in the movie that could lead to good family discussions on how the character's faith was shown through their actions, such as Laura Mayfield-Bennett's dealings with her husband, and how Katie Lapp consistently thinks of how her actions will impact the Amish couple who raised her.

Two thumbs up! I hope movie #3 in the series is out soon!",1369440000,10,1654,4.7491289198606275
5690516,3,B00C4BDG7M,"I really wanted to like this move,but it was a bit of a let down for me. Bev is my favorite author,I read this whole series of books in two days. I did not expect the movie to be as good as the book,movies never are,but I expected more. I just felt like there was so much detail left out. That being said,for people who have not read the books it may have been better. Also,as much as I adore Katie Leclerc,it would have been nice to have the same actress from The Shunning play the roll of Katie Lapp. Overall I am glad I watched it,but I will not be watching again. The book,however,I have read twice now!",1369180800,8,607,4.109243697478991
5690517,4,B00C4BDG7M,"As you know, I'm quite picky with movies.  The Confession was a good, clean film.  I watched it with my family tonight.  There was no bad language or crude jokes.  There were no scenes that would cause you to shield your little ones' eyes or ears.

I found it to be an entertaining movie.  I wanted to encourage the ""good guys"", shake a couple of ""bad guys""  a couple of times, I just wanted to hug Laura and the real Katie Lapp.  I thought the head housekeeper was sweet and adorable.  We liked the movie very much.  But...  we didn't know that it would leave us hanging.  We found that frustrating because we have to wait a long time to find out whether there will be a happily ever after or not.  We are assuming that they will make The Reckoning into a movie as well.  If not, well I just might have to buy the book!

It's not the most exciting movie we've seen, but we would watch it again.  It will stand alone as a story, but I think you would enjoy it more if you watch or read The Shunning first.
I received this dvd in exchange for an honest review.",1369180800,11,1059,4.117647058823529
5690518,5,B00C4BDG7M,"I'm a huge fan of family friend movies and LOVE the Hallmark Channel. Now I've got the perfect review and giveaway just for you. Beverly Lewis is one of the best selling authors on Amish fiction and has been blessed enough to not only have one of her famous series made into a movie with The Shunning but now the second in the The Heritage of Lancaster County Series, The Confession is now ready to be released on DVD on June 11th.

In this latest movie, we once again follow Katie Lapp (Katie Leclerc, TV's ""Switched at Birth), who we left off in The Shunning learning that she was adopted by an Amish couple and was born English. Her birth mother was searching for Katie but her Amish parents kept both of them apart. Only when learning that her birth mother was dying of cancer, did Katie's Amish mother tell her the truth. Now we find ourselves at the beginning of that journey for Katie to find her mother, Laura Mayfield-Bennett (Sherry Stringfield, TV's ""ER""), a socialite now living in New York. She learns from her doctors that she has only weeks left to live before she succumbs to cancer and her only wish in life is to find Katie.

Her husband, Dylan Bennett, is struggling with addiction to alcohol and gambling and she feels if he doesn't get help there won't be anything left of her estate and the foundation she's worked so hard to build. When her husband learns he is being cut out of the will, he is desperate  to satisfy his outstanding gambling debt with some ruthless loan sharks. He learns that Katie is searching for her birth mother, Laura Bennett and soon comes up with a plan to appease his gambling debt and get back in his wife's good graces again but hiring a stand in to act as the long lost daughter. Since Laura has never met the real Katie Lapp and is at the end of her life, she is desperate to believe that Katie has come home at last.

I received The Confession compliments of Sony Pictures, Affirm Films/Provident Films, and Edify Media for my honest review on this DVD and received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. The only flaw I saw in this movie is that the actress who played Katie Lapp (Danielle Panabaker) in The Shunning is different than in The Confession so if you are watching them back to back, there is a disconnect between the character of Katie Lapp. I prefer the first actress from The Shunning but the story overall is amazing. The depths to which the husband will go to make money off of his dying wife is extraordinary and has you rooting for her to throw him out and discover the truth. It's only when someone from Katie's past shows up that things get interesting in the Bennett household. Now I can't wait for the next movie in the Hickory Hollow series and hope that Katie can truly find happiness in either her English life or her Amish one.

This movie was directed by Michael Landon Jr and has a running time of approximately 88 minutes. I had the opportunity to review The Shunning on DVD and think this make a wonderful sequel to the series. If you haven't seen The Shunning, I would suggest watching that one first to understand the back story to Katie's Amish upbringing and why the desire to find her birth mother is so strong. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion.",1368835200,26,3261,4.428333333333334
5690519,3,B00C4BDG7M,"A real feel good movie that has real promise for being really great, but parts in the movie keep it from greatness!
Sherry Stringfield from Guiding Light and ER is a very wealthy mother of a long-lost daughter which she gave up for adoption(this in itself makes no sense--she left the Amish world and ""supposedly"" could live without being a mother to her daughter when a woman has the kind of heart Stringfield has OR Even if Stringfield's character left her daughter there from a teligious instruction standpoint, still, she would not have any problem finding her when she[mother] was looking a few years back; she[daughter] was still with the Amish community back then--finding her daughter was what this movie claims Stringfield's character had trouble doing). Now, her daughter is looking for her, too(who is no problem to find--I mentioned she was rich). Tragically, this reunion is as bittersweet as one can be with her dying of cancer soon. Stringfield's(Mayfield-Bennett) husband is financially down the toilet and needs money in a big way. She is sweet--denoting an Amish background--but not as gullible as most movies would normally write her character to be, but is quite the detective(knows plenty and mentally quick--but has a poker face demeanor until the timing is right). He finds out that she will be cutting him out due to his gambling and inresponsibility. So, he comes up with a genius plan to solve his problems; he knows she is looking for her daughter and knows that he isn't going to inherit enough of her estate, so he hires a young woman to play the part(looks enough like the true daughter, but different hair and eye color[Amish seem like they would frown on something like that which would be instilled in her since she was little; this would indicate deception--as in--she wasn't really Amish] than she was born with--any parent[knowing their daughters real hair and eye color] would notice this in a heartbeat; the real daughter wouldn't have changed her hair/eye color; the mother would know that about Amish life; verdict: geometric proof wise the imposter was fake from the jump]. Then, the true daughter arrives to her husband's dismay(he's not gullible, either; he quickly picks up who she is by how she reacts to certain stimuli). She(servant) slowly starts a romance--Amish style(very clean)--with a dashing young man working on the property. She is just the nicest young woman that anyone would want their son to marry. Since she's so sweet and gullible and even though she knows about his ""shell game""(a telephone conversation they had earlier) afoot, she can't bring her heart to tell her due to her mother's illness which her stepfather surely emphasizes to her. Now then, an old lover(posing to be the true daughter's cousin--a promise he made to her adoptive mother, not to make waves for her) comes along to find her. When he gets there--he seems disinterested bc the ""mole"" is there instead(he should have talked then to eliminate the deception: that was a problem for me; it is just not natural behavior).  He has a conversation with the imposter woman as if it is truly his cousin almost(no joy there at all from either); Mayfield-Bennett(mother) is there observing this ""reunion"". I won't tell any more, only that she--like a detective--deciphers the game and there's a link to a possible trilogy movie(did not like how it ended; kind of sloppy; more of an ending for a book or movie already here and to be aired soon). I gave a 3(I have no bias and have never read the book), but I felt that some parts just didn't add up for me and it could have been conceptually better. Very, sweet warm movie.",1368489600,2,3646,4.871175523349437
5690520,1,B00C4BDG7M,The book was better.  I'm not one to spoil but the story was totally changed from the story of the book I was very disappointed.

It opens with the Amish girl working as a waitress while trying to locate her birth mother.  Her innocence shines through as she inadverdantly lets a customer escape without paying. Thankfully, she has a friend who tries to explain the sneaky ways of ""the English"" to her.  After being misled about the fate of her Mother, she does make her way to her mother's mansion, only to be mistaken for the new help. I have to say, the movie maintains such a good feel all throughout.  And the ending is one that leaves things open for a third installment in the series.  I have to say, though, that I do like the American lawyer over her early childhood sweetheart, even though, Daniel is nice, too.  It is very nice to see that good clean movies like these are being made.  And I look forward to more!",1456099200,,937,4.375722543352601

Although the movies are not as good as the books, I still loved the movies. I watched The Shunning dvd (bought it) and I just watched The Confession dvd twice ( I am going to buy it).  I can't wait for the next dvd!!! I hope they make movies out of all of Beverly Lewis's books because I will definitely be buying all of them!",1400198400,,459,4.032967032967033

5690624,4,B00C4BDG7M,"Beverly Lewis' The Confession picks a short time after the ending of The Shunning.  For those of us who saw The Shunning and were left at the end wanting to know where Katie went and what happened, this is the next section of the story.  Without ruining it for you, basically this part is about Katie locating her biological mother and the strange events that pop up along the way.  This includes  someone falsely proclaiming herself to be Katie for the purpose of manipulating circumstances in someone else's favor for financial gain. Of course this all gets worked out in the end, but the ""end"" (like the first movie) leaves you in the air again.  There are yet again, more things to resolve.  Hence, I believe there is another movie on the way.

I must say here that most popular movies that have a sequel share this in common; the second movie is just not as fresh as the first.  I found that true here.  The actors came back (tired maybe?) and made this second movie - but it is lacking something.  It felt like a second movie.  Still, I enjoyed it.

There were some favorite scenes that were very well acted by each of the actors.  The scene with Katie crying made me cry - you could feel her pain.  Daniel showing up as Yacob Glik was really good.  I saw an opportunity for some comic scenes, but these were very underplayed and it felt like an opportunity was lost there.  I never really understood about the ""letter"" that Laura had that proved to her who Katie really was - I wanted to know how that letter did that....I didn't connect it.  I think ""Yacob"" left it?  Was that scene removed?

Bottom line, if you saw The Shunning you will want to see The Confession.  It is a continuation of the story, but not the conclusion.  It is good family entertainment with nothing inappropriate going on.  I enjoyed it , watched it 3 times then sent it to my mom to watch.  She is enjoying it now with her book club friends who read the Shunning.  I believe you will enjoy it too!",1399161600,4,1980,4.376373626373627

5690627,5,B00C4BDG7M,"The movies we have seen that were adaptations of Beverly Lewis' books appear very well done.  In this one, Katie, the main character meets her  birth mother and stays true to her beliefs in spite of dealing with  the machinations of her birth mother's husband who is trying to keep her from being recognized.  There are some interesting plot twists.  the movie was well done.",1397347200,,375,4.707692307692308

5690630,5,B00C4BDG7M,Another tear jerker. When you watch movies like this one it shows you how greedy some people really are. I loved the story line and I'm glad the . Birth Mother and daughter found each other before the birth mother we to be with God.,1395619200,,232,4.177777777777778
5690631,2,B00C4BDG7M,Storyline weak and improbable definately a big let down from the Shunning. The new Katie was by far the star but so little emotion or conflict for her new life versrs old.,1394755200,,171,4.375
5690632,4,B00C4BDG7M,"I liked this show. It was touching and well-down. I'll keep this brief because I haven't read the book so no comparison there, and where I may not read books in this genre, I do enjoy the movie adaptations of Beverly Lewis' books. The only think I didn't like was the ending. I can completely understand a massive cliffhanger at the end of a book when the next book is available, but they left this one open like they do a great tv show at the end of a season. Despite that, it's a good, clean, family-style movie with a lovely story. I do hope they make a sequel.",1394668800,,564,4.18348623853211

Was just a little disappointed that only four were the same as in the Shunning film. I hope there is another to finish the story. In the Shunning we were left hanging at the end and in the confession we are left hanging too. Good plot and will have to watch it again soon,1392508800,,371,4.23943661971831

5690640,1,B00C4BDG7M,There were crucial changes that made this movie unbearable to watch. The actors were great but I loved the story in its original form so much that I was highly upset. I'll try not to give spoilers in case you still want to watch. The reasons portrayed to doubt one's faith was awful. There is no way that the reason they gave would ever have been enough to motivate a person to leave family behind so devastated. Also I wasn't convinced at how the mother made the discovery and it seemed rushed and incomplete. I don't believe I'll be buying part three.,1389744000,,553,4.431372549019608

5690645,3,B00C4BDG7M,"This movie was terrible, weak, poor, a waste of my $10.00; however, it had no profanity and nice scenery, so I rated it higher.  Had I not seen the first movie -- The Shunning, and had this movie been reasonably priced ($2-3), I may have walked away feeling better about the purchase.  I was so taken in by Beverly Lewis' quality work on The Shunning,(movie), that I was willing to pay the ridiculous price of $10 to see its sequel.  But unlike The Shunning, The Confession has nothing really to do with the Amish.  Instead, The Confession is a drawn out, soap opera like drama, with fake twists and turns, and no cohesive message.  The movie deserves a minus 1, but compared to all the profane garbage on the market right now, I have to take into consideration the fact that at least this movie did not make me gag with disgust.  Very disappointed and wish the purchase was refundable.",1386547200,2,886,4.50625

5690658,4,B00C4BDG7M,"This is a quality Hallmark film with plenty of interesting yet somewhat predictable turns in the story line.  Nonetheless it is worth an afternoon's entertainment.  Katie Leclerc enters the Beverly Lewis trilogy not as the deaf girl we are accustomed to in ""Switched at Birth"" but as Katie Lapp, the young Amish lead character of the Beverly Lewis novels. I found myself expecting her to sign.  Not in this film.  And she has good help from the supporting cast.

Our story opens with Katie having left Hickory Hollow (to find out why she left you have to watch and listen attentively unless you read the book or saw The Shuning, the first in the triology): and then becomes first a restaurant waitress and later a servant in her birth mother's mansion.

The story gripped me until the end; but left me hanging as to what happens in Katie Lapp's love life after she becomes the mistress of her mother's estate.  I confess that I knew the answer since I had read Lewis's third book, The Reckoning.  Movie fans, however,  will have to wait until The Reckoning comes out to find out. Hopefully there will be a filming of #3.  Otherwise this was a decent film proving that movies can still be good, entertaining, thought provoking, and enjoyable  without rough language, explicit sexual content, or graphic violence.  And there is plenty of dialogue if you like dialogue and I do.",1375142400,2,1375,4.707112970711297

The whole thing about Katie's real mother's husband being a gambling addict was different.  Also, the way he tried to convince Katie to leave, and the fact that it worked, was very unconvincing and unrealistic.  And Katie's real mom didn't convincingly play a very sick woman who was dying.

5690671,3,B00C4BDG7M,"The 411 by Maria:

My first reaction was; Michael Landon's son directed? I want to see it. I was a huge fan of Michael Landon and figured Little House on The Prairie is a show I grew up loving, let's see what Pa's boy has learned!

The Confession has nothing to do with the 1800s as the Laura Ingalls Wilder series but it has as much heart as any Little House on The Prairie show that I grew up crying over.

Socialite Laura, is dying. She has a progressive form of cancer. On her quest to get her life in order she had set out to find a daughter she gave up to be raised by an Amish family in Lancaster. Now hearing that her cancer has progressed she is preparing for the end.  Katie hears her birth mother was looking for her and heads to NY to find her only to be informed that Laura has already passed, thanks to Laura's selfish husband who has a plan of his own. His problems have gotten him in some hot water and he needs all of Laura's money.  Thanks to a well meaning NY friend with a terrible fake accent (there were many poorly acted fake accents), Katie is reassured that if a socialite had passed it would be all over the news and someone is lying. Sooo...Katie sets out to meet her momma.

Things take an interesting turn when Katie arrives and finds out that Laura's daughter has already arrived.

Back in Lancaster, Katie's family is dealing with the return of an old friend while the modern world tries to infiltrate their very beliefs as and Amish family.

The movie moves quickly and while there are a few plot oddities that are unexplainable but would give the whole movie away if I were to list them. I didn't hate it.

The things that may turn viewers off:

  Katie leaves her Amish family for the lavish life style seemingly quick.

  Laura figures the deceit going on under her roof and explains it away with a letter Katie sent out to her Amish family. You really need to piece it together and remember what Katie had written to her parents.

  The ending was God awful. As of now there is no green light for a sequel and the ending demands one.",1372723200,,2069,4.275064267352185

5690674,4,B00C4BDG7M,"Disclosure: I received a copy of The Confession from Edify Media Inc. for review purposes only. I was not required to give a good review and all opinions are my own.

I remember seeing The Shunning and that I liked it, but I enjoyed this one even more. I admit there was a bit of a predictability with how the plot will go, but it is still a well told story that kept my interest from start to finish. This is somewhat like a fairy-tale, so you have to believe there will be a ""happily-ever-after"" ending...eventually. Keep in mind, though, that this is part of a trilogy. When Katie's first love, Daniel, reportedly drowned in The Shunning, I hoped he would return in a future film. He does! However...Katie also has a new love interest. Does Katie choose Daniel or Justin? Will Katie return to her Amish upbringing? The Confession leaves us hanging until the next film for those answers, but I am eagerly anticipating it. The film is peopled with characters whose stories intrigued me and left me wanting more.

Is it necessary to see The Shunning first? No. This film can be viewed as a stand-alone film without the viewer becoming confused about the story. For those who have seen the previous film, there are different actors in some roles (including Katie), but they are true to the characters you know. This is a family friendly drama and the faith aspect is touched on, but is not the main focus. I am not a fan of ""sappy"" movies whose major purpose is to make people cry, and am happy to say that while The Confession has the ""tug at your heart"" moments, it's not the emotional manipulation that annoys me.

The film, directed by Michael Landon Jr. and written by Michael Landon Jr. and Brian Bird is based on the book by Beverly Lewis.",1371859200,,1745,4.515822784810126
5690675,4,B00C4BDG7M,"The Confession written by Beverly Lewis made into a DVD is excellent. I was quite intrigued by how this second movie in the series kept my interest and how it turned out.
The actors did a wonderful job and the settings were marvelous. I loved the mansion Laura lived in and the sounding grounds.
  I like how Katie was pushed into being a servant in her mother's house and how she was sweet and loving about it.
  This is a wholesome family movie that will be fantastic for a family night. It teaches many lessons and like the DVD covers says The Confession is ""A touching story of deceit, trust and love.""
  I would highly recommend this DVD to everyone. If you love Amish stories and good movies this one is for you. I love the way it ended, but I know a third one will be coming out and I look forward to that.

I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of Amish fiction, but the stories that Beverly Lewis shares are the exception. Add  Sherry Stringfield (who I loved in ER) and Michael Landon Jr (who beautifully directed the Love Comes Softly series of movies) and I was hooked. The Confession is part two of the sweet story of a girl searching for her mother and the challenges she faces along the way. This is definitely one to add to your collection.",1370908800,,569,4.268518518518518
5690677,5,B00C4BDG7M,"The Confession follows the first book/DVD, The Shunning, and the plot thickens.
The heroine is able to get enough information to find her birth mother.
She has been shunned by the community; therefore it is easier for her
to leave her home.  By the end of this segment, the viewer is wondering
how it all will be resolved!!
I had to order the third book to find out!!  The DVD for the third part hasn't been released yet. Each part is well written and interesting.

5690678,4,B00C4BDG7M,"Movies that end on cliff hangers always leave me waiting anxiously for the next one--and as I mentioned The Shunning did just that so I was super excited when I found out that the next movie in the series, Beverly Lewis' the Confession, was finally here! Since watching the movies I have picked up two of the books in the series, but I'm waiting to get all three before I start reading them-so I don't have the ability to compare them to the books (yet). I've learned I like reading the books after movies though-since that way movies aren't a let down!

Once again Halmark delivers a movie that is touching, fun, and very family friendly. In the Confession Katie continues her hunt for her birth mother before it's too late. In an interesting twist it seems she does find her--but is it too late for other reasons? This movie kept me once again on the edge of my seat, wanting to explain what was going on to the characters as I waited for everything to come together.

The infamous love triangle kind of, sort of, begins to raise it's head but much less than the movies description would have you to think it does--I will be interested to see how that will develop in the last movie in the series!

There were a few things about this movie that will keep me from giving it a 5 star rating. It always bothers me when Halmark flip flops between actors and actresses and expect us to not realize it--I would love it if they could latch people into deals if they know there will be 3 movies in a series--especially the main characters. Just a small pet peeve of mine, however! Also I felt like things were very rushed along--I still don't ""get"" how one of the crucial moments in the movie came into play because a big mystery that was revealed was glossed over quickly when it came to explaining how it was found out. I'm sure in the book it goes into much more detail-and it would have been worth it to expound a little in the movie.

Overall, however, I really did enjoy this movie! The acting was very good and caused me to tear up, the cinematography was well done, and it didn't have a low budget feel to it--which Halmark is usually very good about. Once again it's perfect for a chick flick night with the girls that even your daughter will enjoy so in spite of the few nit picky things I'd definitely recommend it!

Legalese Disclosure Nonsense: It wouldn't be nice to send me one movie and not another, so I was very happy when I received The Confession to review. All teary eyes, snuggly chick flick nights, and nit picky opinions are, as always, my own.",1369958400,,2562,4.39662447257384
