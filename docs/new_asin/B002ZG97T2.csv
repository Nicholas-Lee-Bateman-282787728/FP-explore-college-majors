4018320,2,B002ZG97T2,"This film is still showing at my local theatre weeks after it came out. I am in Rhinebeck NY and the director went to Vassar which is nearby so maybe that partly explains it. Personally, I can't figure it out. This movie has 0 redeeming qualities. Ben Stiller is very creepy in this role and in the way the camera makes him look. There are plenty of depressing and/or narcissistic films out there that I have enjoyed since I first started watching movies over 40 years ago, but this isn't one of them. In a rare moment for us, my wife and our son went as well and their review is essentially the same as mine. The trailer to this film is phenomenally misleading as it really made me want to see this film. You have been forewarned !",1271635200,7,732,4.273381294964029
4018321,3,B002ZG97T2,"I was really excited for this movie because I am the same age as Greenberg and thought it would be relatable.

However, the plot was random and disjointed, and the characters not very interesting.

The idea for the movie seemed to be better than the movie itself, however the actress that played Florence did a great job.",1271030400,,321,4.614035087719298
4018322,4,B002ZG97T2,"A ""romantic comedy/drama"" featuring depressed and unlikable people is a tough sell.  That GREENBERG works to the degree it does is a testament to the good writing and outstanding acting...but it cannot completely overcome the essential problem embedded in its premise.  That doesn't mean a movie about unlikable people is a bad idea, but expecting such a film to receive a warm, loving embrace by the audience is a bit of a stretch.

Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) a New York based carpenter who once had a shot at rock star glory, is recently out of a mental institution for severe depression.  He's now in Hollywood, house-sitting for his brother and family, who are on extended vacation.  House-sitting pretty much involves taking care of Mahler, the family German shepherd.  And Roger is assisted in this minimal task by Florence (Greta Gerwig), the personal assistant of Roger's brother...she brings him groceries and essentially handles any small tasks Roger might have.

Thus, Roger is allowed to wallow in his self pity.  He ""engages"" himself in the idea of constructing a doghouse for Mahler...and constantly insists that he's doing a great and noble and generous thing by building it.  Yet, over the course of what feels like a few weeks, he only gets about halfway done.  He is stuck in a malaise of self-hatred...which hatred he shares generously with those around him by being scornful and dismissive.  Everyone is a fake or a phony.  Everyone is worthy of derision.  But when simply arising in the morning is a monumental task, I imagine it would be hard to care much for your fellow man.

Florence, a clearly intelligent young woman who is also adrift in a life going nowhere, would normally be the most depressing character in any other movie, but in comparison to Roger, she is practically sunshine and light.  She also suffers from low self-esteem, which has her engaging in a series of one-night stands that leave her clearly unfulfilled and feeling even worse about herself.  She and Roger drift into a ""sort of"" relationship.  They come together briefly for a ""date,"" then Roger says or does something awful and the bounce apart.  Her friends tell her to leave him alone.  His inner-voice makes him wonder why he treats her so badly.  He clearly likes something about her (perhaps her openness to feeling, rather than his cutting-off of feeling), but then he acts as though he can't abide her.  He's like the kid in elementary school who punches the girl he really likes, to show how immune to liking a girl he is.

Stiller also reaches out to his old bandmates, particularly Ivan (Rhys Ifans)...these men were once his friends, but years ago, with a record contract on the table, Greenberg apparently scuttled the whole deal and the band fell apart.  This has bred enormous resentments between the men.  Ivan, a good man struggling to hold his family together, seems genuinely interested in befriending Greenberg.  He seems to feel responsible for providing some companionship, however strained, to this lost soul.  But Greenberg can't stop picking away at the man, mocking his choice of a marriage partner and generally belittling him.

What is convincing about GREENBERG is that no one has a sudden flash of redemption.  The script hews closely to what ""real life"" would be like...if these characters DO make any progress, it will be tentative and painfully slow.  Most of the time, it's one step forward, two steps back.  The best we can hope for is to see the dynamic shift to two steps forward and one step back.

This makes it very hard to warm up to the characters.  They are fascinating and involving, but throughout viewing this, I was constantly telling myself, ""These are awful people.  I could care less what happens to them.""  This was particularly true for Greenberg.  I felt sorry but frustrated for Florence...but Roger Greenberg needed a good smack upside the head.

That the movie is enjoyable at all is due to some sharp writing, including the use of the dog Mahler as the vehicle through which Roger and Florence can tentatively bond.  Their concern for the dog gives them excuses to come together, even when angry at each other.  Further, the excellent work from Stiller and Gerwig elevates the film.  These two interesting actors give themselves completely over to their work, and it's very effective.  Gerwig is not someone I've noticed before, but she is vulnerable and assured in her work.  I'd like to see her now tackle a less trouble character; I suspect there's an effervescent personality there.  And Stiller has always had a dark side, even in his most ""family friendly"" characters; but here he just gives himself over completely to that darkness.  I hope like heck he isn't really like this...but he sure plays it convincingly.  And Rhys Ifans gives another outstanding performance.  He's quiet and contained, so that when his inevitable outpouring of feeling comes, the impact is all the greater.

I encourage adult movie-goers who enjoy tight writing and good acting to check out GREENBERG.  If you're looking for a ""happy"" time at the movies, though...look elsewhere.",1270512000,38,5123,4.924154025670945

4018332,2,B002ZG97T2,"This movie is sort of the definition of mediocre. It has a real resounding flatline feel to it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with tackling the whole subject of aging, regret, and trying to recapture lost youth, especially in a sober, realistic tone like this. It's just that this movie failed to deliver anything exciting. It was not full blown depressing the way some other people described it as much as it was a little frustrating. There needed to be some more payoff in the human emotion element, like wittier dialogue or cooler life choices by the characters or something.

A great example of a movie that did midlife problems well was ""Crazy Stupid Love."" That movie tackled some of the midlife melancholy, but had snappy dialogue, interesting developments, good music and production design. That movie came together in a slick way. This movie didn't necessarily need to have a slick production design but it could have been good, and at least it needed wittier dialogue and character and plot developments. I have no real problem giving this two stars.

I agree with others that it kind of sucked that neither of the two ballast roles of this movie were very likable (neither Stiller nor Gerwig). They were just a little too clunky, awkward, and unlikable to carry the whole movie. Stiller's character was just kind of an awkward a-hole, and Gerwig's is just too mopey and dopey to be likable. There's not much in your head saying that these two should get together. For that reason, the resolution doesn't really pay off. If there was going to be no slick production design, mise en scene, or music, there needed to be dynamic story lines and character interactions. There was none of the above, and the movie scores below average, although I can't say that I really hate this movie either.",1422576000,,1803,4.794212218649518

4018337,3,B002ZG97T2,"The actors all do a great job. It's well written. But the main character is just repellant. Greenberg puts no effort into normal conversation or social interaction. His former band mates nurse grudges, he didn't show up in time for his mother's death, he never asks after his best friend's son, it goes on and on. I so wanted Ivan to truly get fed up; when the moment comes, he is much too kind. And the senseless verbal attacks on Florence. Please. She gives him too many chances to be a decent human being, instead of backing slowly away. There are hints of better things to come, but the only evolution onscreen is in Greenberg's care of the dog.

Lots of well-known critics gave this movie positive reviews. I can't agree that it's ""Extremely Entertaining!"" or ""The wonder of the film is how good it makes us feel."" More like extremely irritating throughout and relief when it was over.",1407628800,2,890,4.59748427672956

4018343,1,B002ZG97T2,"Another annoying move glorifying narcissism & behaving as an inappropriate weirdo well past adulthood. Not funny, not interesting, not anything. What was the point? My favorite human character was the English friend, because he was simply the only person who showed a whole lot of character. Second was the brother away traveling in Vietnam, because he finally chewed his idiotic, rude, pathetic brother's ass. However the only person I really cared about in the film was the dog. In fact the dog, I am convinced, is the only reason I sat through this entire film. I really just wanted to make sure the dog wasn't killed by one of the idiots that was caring for him. So many unrealistic, unconvincing events in this film, including how Gerwig's character ""cared"" for the dog but just allowed it to be in the hands of the obviously irresponsible idiot, Greenberg. And of course there had to be a few unnecessarily graphic awkward sex scenes to go along with the rest of the awkward & unnecessary movie itself. I swear sometimes films are just being made for the purpose of exposing the breasts of some poor actress who wants to further her career & just go with the flow or get a part no matter what she has to sacrifice & of course this is all for the entertainment of men only. Do filmmakers realize or care that women are 50% of their audience? Except with this film, I'm not sure who it was actually trying to entertain.

The sad truth is the US is filled with these stratospherically spoiled useless imbeciles, many of whom graduate from college with degrees in sociology or psychology. Terminally adolescent, utterly rude, incapable of restraining his vile behavior, he finds a perfect match in Gerwig's wasp space cadet, who leaps from bed to bed with no sense of purpose or virtue, and whose standards could hardly be lower. Is this what liberal self loathing guilt looks like?

4018363,2,B002ZG97T2,"Cenk Uygur said it best when he referred to this film as an ""Iceberg"", as in avoid at all costs. And Greenberg is essentially that, you follow around an annoying, bitter, unlikable character named Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) for the majority of the film as he interacts with the various people which surround him. There's Florence (Greta Gerwig), the housemaid of his brother who's house he's staying at, and Ivan (Rhys Ifans), a friend and former bandmate who comes to visit him from time to time. I was greatly surprised to see Stiller in a role like this, as it's far different from most other roles he has done. In Permanent Midnight he played a heroin addict, and he was more likable than he is in this movie. Greenberg, like every Noah Baumbach movie I've seen, was a cinematic failure. It's really just a slice of life story following a bunch of miserable, depressed failures interacting and trying to get through the day. It didn't interest me in the slightest, as I didn't ""love"" any of the characters, although I did somewhat like Florence and Ivan, that's about it.

Greenberg just got out of a mental hospital, for petes sake, lets cut him some slack. He takes care of his abusive brother & sister-in-law's house. He obviously feels more for Mahler than they do. He tries to deal with too many worldly insights (& a deep sense of guilt) by writing letters to editors (& gets published in the NY Times!).

I thought Stiller did a brilliant job of making this guy just funny & likable enough yet showed his insecure & unpredictable sides so well. I've known my share of Greenbergs, believe me. I thought Greta Gerwig was sensational as well: goofy, sweet, naive.

My sense is that (younger?) audiences these days expect movies to tell them bedtime stories which must either have happy endings depicting success & fame or be totally unreal action fantasies full of invincible superheroes.

Greenberg cuts too close to the bone. It demands objectivity & a sense of forgiveness, neither of which are in much abundance these days.",1327363200,3,1279,4.8

He is house sitting in Los Angeles for his wealthy brother following a mental breakdown, and he soon develops feelings for Florence, his brother's quiet, patient personal assistant and nanny.  Greta Gerwig excels in the role of Florence and allows us to lock into the emotional stasis of Greenberg and understand more easily her attraction to someone so unstable.  These two wonderfully realized characters ground the film and provide balance.  There is an equilibrium, a series of forces that ebb and flow, a directorial wisdom that knows exactly when to incorporate and reincorporate certain characters, expanding and retracting our sense of Greenberg's post-breakdown LA milieu with an untraditional but natural rhythm. The ending is perfection, signaling to us that clean endings and transitions do not exist for these particular people.  There is a slight awkwardness about its conclusion, but its incompleteness and suddenness represent a cast and crew that knew these characters and were committed to doing them justice.

4018375,4,B002ZG97T2,"A film I immediately felt I needed to see again, I found this
fascinating and sometimes maddening.

Ben Stiller plays a truly unlikable 'hero', a man so angry that he
can't maintain any sort of real friendship, much less romantic
relationship.

What's admirable about the film, is that all the acting is so rich and
subtle, as is the writing, that no one ends up a caricature.

There's also an admirable unwillingness to give into convention, to
provide easy answers or heartwarming redemption. This is about a man
maybe taking the first step from A to B and we're not sure in the end
he'll even make it that far.

On the downside, there is a certain repetitiveness to it. We 'get'
Greenberg and his anger, and sometimes the going in circles feels like
just filling time instead of proving a point about how stuck the
character is emotionally.

Also, there's mention of Greenberg's vulnerability, but if that had
been allowed to be just a bit more evident it might have better
balanced his off-putting downside. As is, on first viewing, the film
felt a bit removed and intellectual.

But I could easily imagine that impression changing on revisiting, now
that I'm prepared for it's dark and difficult tone.

In any case, I found this  a very good, if challenging film that's well worth
seeing, from one of our most interesting creators of complex characters.

On the other hand, it certainly won't be to everyone's taste or mood. I have
a feeling reactions to a film that has this much 'nails on a chalkboard' feeling

The two main characters - the 40-year-old Roger (Ben Stiller) and the 25-year-old Florence (Greta Gerwig) are both about five percent shy of ""normal."" Roger's shrink told him as much, and at one point he acknowledges this to Florence, but for her part Florence is unaware of her five percent mental deficit, though she does admit that she is ""nerdy."" Interestingly, Roger and Florence suffer from opposite forms of a five percent deficit.

Roger is narcissistic, neurotic, angry, abusive, and suffers from OCD. While he is capable of an intellectual and calculated kind of empathy, he does this mostly to manipulate others. If Roger were ten percent off rather than five, he'd be a full-blown sociopath. On some level Roger is aware that he has a problem, but he underestimates it and tends to view the entire world as having a problem rather than himself. That is why he is constantly writing formal letters of complaint to virtually every company with which he comes into contact, including the taxi company when he takes a taxi.

Florence is the opposite side of Roger's coin. She is selfless, excessively kind, accommodating and emotionally empathetic. Unlike Roger, Florence imagines that problems are her fault. She doesn't see Roger as a man with serious problems, even though she knows that he was recently discharged from a mental hospital. She sees Roger as a ""vulnerable"" man who needs TLC. And perhaps the most serious problem for Florence is that she WANTS to be the one to give a man like Roger lots of TLC.

Five percent may not sound like much, but keep in mind that human DNA differs from chimp DNA by only two percent. :-) In Roger and Florence, a five percent mental deficiency has a profound impact on how they see the world and on their behavior. Both Roger and Florence are intelligent; there is no deficiency there. Watching this film caused me to wonder what would have the more damaging impact: a five percent emotional deficit or a five percent intellectual deficit? I suppose that in either case a lot would depend on the nature of the deficit.

There were a couple of occasions in which we get a glimpse of Roger and Florence as they would be if they were ""normal."" However, there was a catch. Roger was open, friendly and engaging when he was loaded with cocaine and Valium (he drinks a lot of alcohol, but that doesn't seem to ""help""). Florence was able to muster a personality only when she was being abused. I felt that Roger was a hopeless case, while Florence could probably become a nearly ""normal,"" healthy person if she saw a good therapist. But that may be my bias talking, as I believe that empathetic people are more fixable than non-empathetic people. Maybe a person like Roger could be helped with the right kind of medication. Some mental problems don't seem to be amenable to talk therapy.

Some might see Roger and Florence, damaged as they are, as complementary to each other, as ""good"" for each other. The conclusion of the film seems to suggest that they might stay together and develop some kind of workable relationship. Call me unromantic, but I just can't see Roger making it with anyone, even a martyr like Florence. And even if Florence was willing to put up with a man like Roger, I would feel like she was cheating herself out of a decent life. Part of Florence's problem is that she has never had a nice boyfriend, and unfortunately for her she can't seem to imagine what a nice boyfriend would be like. Her focus seems to be on whether a man - any man - might be able to love her because, for her, loving others - even a man as bad as Roger - is so easy and automatic.

There was one aspect of the film that wasn't developed enough for me. Twenty years earlier Roger had been a song writer and member of a rock band. Florence wrote songs and sang at a local bar on amateur night. However, they never shared their mutual love of music, and if they talked about music at all it was very casual. For both of them, music seemed to be an incidental part of the story, and I'm not sure what it was doing in there.

Another interesting aspect of this film was Roger's brother, who, on the surface at least, had all the ""normal"" signs of a happy, successful guy. He was a very successful businessman with a wife, two kids, a dog, and a personal assistant for his family (Florence). But in one short scene we hear him talking with Roger on the phone, and we discover that the brother is missing perhaps four percent (compared to Roger's five percent). It was then that I began to contemplate what a difference one percent could make, between Roger (the miserable failure) and his brother (the ""happy"" success). Or, it could be the case that Roger's brother was missing six percent, the added percentage being excessive greed, ambition and control, accounting for his outward success. This film gives you much to think about if you don't get put off too much with the ""unlikable characters"" aspect.

In some ways this movie reminded me of ""As Good As It Gets,"" with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. In that movie, Nicholson played a man with the same five percent missing as Roger, and he gets involved with a young, pretty woman. I felt the same about that relationship as I do about this one.

I enjoyed watching this movie. It had good acting, good directing and a good script. It's a character-driven, rather than a plot-driven, movie. It made me wonder how many percentage points shy of normal I am. :-) The characters are not likable, but it's a likable-enough film. ""As Good As It Gets"" has a similair theme, and bigger star actors, but I enjoyed this film much more.",1321142400,3,5752,4.560503388189739

The ""romance"" between the lead characters is completely unbelievable.  However the worst part of this film for me is the dog.  Well the dog is actually wonderful and that's the problem.  I was wondering if the dog was okay through most of the film.  If you are an animal lover this movie will drive you crazy with worry!  At every turn I expected him to forget to give Mahler(the dog) medication and find him dead.  Very distracting.  I know it seems ridiculous but there you have it.",1316131200,,659,4.470588235294118

There's absolutely no chemistry between Stiller, Gerwig, and Rhys Ifans (who plays Greenberg's 'only' friend), they look lost.

4018380,3,B002ZG97T2,"Just as he's turning forty, Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) finds himself with no real friends, no significant other, and no actual purpose in life. He's also just been released from a mental institution, so you can well imagine that his neuroses are going to be pretty much off the chart as well. A carpenter and former musician who regularly resides in New York City, Greenberg is currently house-sitting at the Hollywood Hills home of his wealthy and successful brother, Phillip (Chris Messina), while the latter is away on business in Vietnam with his family. While he's staying there, Greenberg meets Florence (Greta Gerwig), a sweet but rather unfocused woman almost half his age, who works as a personal assistant - i.e. dog walker, babysitter and all-around gopher - to Phillip and his family.

Greenberg's mental issues manifest themselves through various phobias and idiosyncrasies, all of which lead us to the conclusion that he is generally just afraid of life, of taking a risk when doing so could possibly lead to failure. To that end, he avoids large groups of people, writes endless letters of complaints to companies he feels have somehow screwed him over, overreacts to other people's words and actions, and makes a general antisocial and sociopathic pain-in-the-ass of himself. And to no one is he more psychologically abusive than to Florence, a girl with her own share of vulnerabilities, who in his own crazy way he is obviously trying to impress but who he just keeps pushing away with his eccentric behavior.

It's hard to really get much of a bead on either Greenberg or Florence, and that is both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the screenplay by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Noah Baumbach, who also directed the film. On the one hand, one appreciates the complexity of the characters, their refusal to allow themselves to be pigeon-holed into one neatly delineated box or other. On the other, the coolly objective stance the script takes creates a barrier between us and the characters, the result being that we find it hard to identify or empathize much with them, especially Greenberg, who finally becomes as off-putting to us as he is to those he comes in contact with throughout the course of the picture. In drama, there's a fine line between a character who is intriguingly different and one who is just annoyingly self-indulgent, and ""Greenberg"" crosses over that line with dismaying regularity.

Still, the performances are excellent - this is probably Stiller's best dramatic work to date - and the inconclusive ending is impressively brave enough to erase a multitude of earlier sins.",1311120000,,2634,5.0091324200913245

This film doesn't work on any level. Number one, the relationship between Greenberg and Florence. There is no reason in the world Florence, the assistant, would be attracted to Stiller's character. None. The first ""sex scene"" between them is embarrassing for all the wrong reasons: it is simply embarrassing. Then later in the film Stiller's angry, ""Are we going out or what?,"" he wants to know. What's he talking abou? He's twenty years older (not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that), he's visiting from New York, she's a screwball and not a particularly lovable one, she drops her clothes at the drop of a hat, there is nothing the slightest bit attractive about Greenberg, including his being recently released from a mental home .... On and on. The film even gets off to an awful start, the inexplicable playing of the mediocre ""Jetliner"" while Florence drives around LA doing errands. What's that supposed to signify? That Stiller's flying in to town?
Virtually all of the cutesy-quirky dialogue doesn't work, isn't funny, and not a single one of the letters Stiller writes to various companies complaining about this or that has any humor or wit.
This film should have explored -- and Baumbach's the person to do it -- its two most interesting themes: aging, and how Stiller's character screwed over his former bandmates and the reprecussions from that. Instead it only touches on those things. And the party scene, tiotally unconvincing, where Still tees off on today's youth ....

4018406,1,B002ZG97T2,"Ben Stiller is a good actor, and I give him credit for portraying a genuinely unlikable guy.  But that's it.  If you want to watch a movie with an unlikable lead that is actually entertaining, check out ""In a Lonely Place"" with Humphrey Bogart.

""Greenberg"" is like pretentious ""Literary"" Fiction turned into a movie.  20-SOMETHING KID WHO LIKED ""GREENBERG"": ""It's like, a Post-modern thing, Man... it's SUPPOSED to be dreadfully dull and pointless and utterly painful to watch... I mean, that's how real life is, ya know what I'm sayin'?""

Real life is indeed awkward and painful, and good movies can portray this in an entertaining way.  But ""Greenberg"" is not one of them.  For a story to be engaging, we must be able to connect with at least one of the characters.  My favorite character in this film was portrayed by a German Shepherd.  That dog was pretty cool.

I'm not sure how it ever became hip to make movies that are flat, dull, pretentious, plot-less, and awkward (and then have people rave about them as examples of good art)... but I think it started with Wes Anderson.

The film tells of Roger Greenberg, an anti-social, seemingly bi-polar man who is housesitting for his brother for six weeks.  Back in his hometown, the town he escaped long ago, Greenberg becomes reacquainted with old frienemies and becomes newly acquainted with an equally lost soul; Florence Marr.  Florence is Roger's brother's housekeeper, and she instantly finds herself drawn to Roger despite his prickly demeanor.  Ben Stiller is very good as Greenberg, but it is undeniably Greta Gerwig who steals the whole show.  Her introverted take on Florence is astonishingly deep-seated.  Despite her quiet exterior, she exudes such rich character.  You can believe her attraction to Greenberg, despite his mistreatment of her.  She's afraid of who he is and yet that fear intrigues her.  Despite the fact that we really don't get her `story', at least not to the extent that we get Roger's, you can feel it develop in the empty space in the film.

Admittedly, I wasn't paying attention this past decade, so it took me a while to realize the potency of quirky-savant, Noah Baumbach's unique style as a writer and director.  So it wasn't until I saw his latest movie, Greenberg, that I took the time to reexamine his body work on imdb and think about what it is that makes his movies linger in my thoughts so long after I see them.

In the interest of candor, I will note that I exempt Margot at the Wedding from any praise I have to offer Baumbach, because that movie pretty much sucked. I do recall, however, being particularly moved by The Squid and the Whale, Baumbach's autobiographical story about two young boys dealing with their parents' divorce in Brooklyn in the 1980s. Having first seen it circa 2006, I recall, more than anything else, its eery authenticity. I guess the easiest way to explain what I mean by that would be to simply confess that as a child of the 1980s, my perception of the movie was most impacted by one thing: corduroy pants.

Specifically, the corduroy pants and other historically-accurate clothing items worn by the two boys stuck with me, because scene after scene, I thought to myself that those kids' clothes came straight from the pictures of me as a toddler in my mom's old photo albums. (I actually get the same feeling when I watch Kramer vs. Kramer, but that was actually made in the 80s). And though seemingly fickle, I think Baumbach's ability to powerfully strike such a nuanced cord is a testament to his skill as a director.

As a writer, Baumbach is quite versatile. In fact, I didn't realize until after I saw Greenberg that he also had a hand in writing the satirical gem, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. But after that, Baumbach went dark with The Squid and the Whale, and then darker with the crap-melodrama, Margot at the Wedding. So, after probably realizing the crappiness of the latter, Baumbach relinquished his heavy pen to get re-acclamated with his lighter one.

And with it, he penned Greenberg, in which he successfully layers subtle, high-brow comedy over darker, more serious themes. The movie stars Ben Stiller as a neurotic New Yorker who, fresh out of the nut house, moves to L.A. to housesit for his brother with the simultaneous desire to ""do nothing."" While there, he rekindles friendships with his estranged high school buds and begrudgingly falls in love with the quaint but damaged personal assistant of his brother's family.

In a way, Greenberg, is Baumbach's greatest work to date - and while I am sure diehard movie and/or Baumbach fans will snobbishly heave at that statement, I say it because I feel this movie is the most all-inclusive display of Baumbach's varied talents. Like his work with Wes Anderson, the movie is artfully witty. Ben Stiller seems to have been a natural fit for the role as a result, as he showed that he can stretch his comedic range to serviceably encompass the Anderson/Baumbach brand of comedy in The Royal Tenenbaums; albeit, his performance in Greenberg was much better, as it gave him a chance to act dramatically under the guise of a ""comedic performance."" That is not to say that he wasn't very funny, because he was. Rather, I simply meant that the role allowed him to sneak in a terrific acting performance for an audience expecting only to see him be funny.

In my favorite scene of the movie, Greenberg's free-spirited, college-aged niece unexpectedly imposes a rager of a house party on Greenberg. In the darker-themes sense, this sequence highlights Greenberg's instability and the unpredictable avenues toward self-destruction that open to him as a result. By way of comedy, however, we get to watch Greenberg go from ferociously cleaning and policing the party to blowing lines of cocaine off a mirror with the 20ish year old-guests (definitely Stiller's best coked-up performance since the disco dance-off in Starskey & Hutch). And as you can imagine, Greenberg's cocaine-fueled neuroses are immensely enjoyable, as he goes from rapidly explaining his paranoia about generation-Y, to swapping out the kids' Korn CD for a Duran Duran ""record"" (because it's ""much better coke music""), to proffering (almost to himself), ""I've been thinking about getting back into drugs,"" (to many, a relatable sentiment).

Stylistically, Baumbach drapes a 1970s-Los Angeles veil over the entire movie, just as he did with 1980s-Brooklyn in The Squid and the Whale. In fact, it wasn't until a reference to e-mail about 10 minutes in that I realized Greenberg takes place in the present day.

And whether its that retro-effect or some other component of his filmmaking, Baumbach has a way of making his movies stick in your subconscious by provoking contemporaneous thought. For example, at the beginning of Greenberg, there is a long continuous shot of the female lead (played by Greta Gerwig) driving in her car, listening to ""Jet Airliner"" by Steve Miller Band. The shot is almost uncomfortably long, causing the audience to hear much more of ""Jet Airliner"" than one would otherwise expect to hear of a song in a movie. The audience can't help but notice and as the song keeps playing, the audience has time to internally reflect: 'Man, this is a really long shot...I can't believe it's still going... This is a really great song though... Do I have it on my iPod?... No I don't think I do... If not, I'll download it.'

And just like that, Baumbach has miraculously anchored his movie in your mind. So when you go to download ""Jet Airliner"" later on, or every time you hear it thereafter, you reflexively think of the relatively unremarkable actress driving her bland little car in that quirky, little movie, Greenberg.

4018411,5,B002ZG97T2,"Many people who watch Noah Baumbach's latest film Greenberg feel that the title character is so unlikable, that the film fails due to its protagonist's personality. In fact, Baumbach presents us with a challenge, much like he did with 2007's Margot at the Wedding. Greenberg is not likable. He is narcissistic, misanthropic, brutally honest, and cynical and unaware of anyone's feelings outside of his own, which are more important than yours by the way. He also hates on L.A culture to the point where I think he is drawn to it for the verbal ammunition it gives him. However, Baumbach manages to balance these traits with a humanization that is painfully acute and accurate, by showing us what it is like to be Greenberg. Many people are not going to want to know what it's like to be Greenberg. That's fine; because Baumbach did not make this film for everyone.

Something very interesting and smart that the director does is starting the film from Florence's (Greta Gerwig) perspective. Florence is Roger Greenberg's (Ben Stiller) brother's assistant. His brother and family are going away on vacation to Vietnam and Greenberg comes to his brother's house in L.A to stay after living in New York City and coming off of a recent stint in a mental hospital. While Greenberg is the main character, the film starts with Florence and we are shown in a brief period of time what her life is like. She has a best friend named Gina, she is a good and hard working assistant and she goes to a bar where she eventually has a one night stand which is clearly irregular and dissatisfying for her. She is awkward; certainly not someone who asserts herself around others. She is not meek though; she is just not quite sure of herself as an individual yet. By aligning us with Florence, an easily relatable character right from the beginning, Baumbach is able to balance her with Greenberg's own inadequacies and allows Florence to be more than just the ""girl"". She becomes a character in her own right, just as important to the story through Baumbach's use of her in the film's first scenes.

Once we are introduced to Greenberg, Florence only recieves a few more scenes to herself because after all, this is a story about Roger Greenberg first and foremost. However, the focus on her perspective is never lost, keeping the examination of her character in check throughout the film. Greenberg is a carpenter now, not what he planned for his life but he does the job. While in L.A though, he has decided to experimentally do nothing. He attempts to reconnect with his best friend Ivan (Rhys Ifans) who is going through a trial separation. Ivan's character parallels Greenberg in the many ways in which they differ. We learn that he and Ivan used to have a band called The Magic Marker with a couple of others, that they were offered a record deal and that Roger turned down without consulting the rest of the group drastically altering the lives of the other group members involuntarily. He did not want to sign with a major label because he felt they would become corporate slaves. The problem is that this was the only offer the band received leading to the band's brake up prompting Greenberg's move to New York shortly after. He and Ivan have never discussed any of this and while Ivan genuinely enjoys seeing Greenberg again, he also has a difficult time with it which we see through his increasing reluctance towards Greenberg every time they see each other. These scenes between the two of them are show so much about the passage of time (a major theme in the film) and display Greenberg's inability to look outside of his own world. Ivan wants a friend to talk to but all Roger can say is that he is happy that Ivan is splitting from his wife as he never liked them together in the first place. He cannot understand why Ivan is so upset about the speration even though Ivan is clearly distraught over the effect this will have on his son Victor.

One of the more fascinating things about Greenberg is the grudge he has about his own generation for not being the current generation and the absolute disdain he has for the current generation for simply existing. All he sees are kids that rely too much on technology and have lost a grip on the world. He sees kids who are lost and are incapable of asserting themselves as a culturally relevant and thoughtful crowd. Not to mention that his references go over their heads. One review of the film remarks on the climactic party scene in which he takes coke and rants about his disgust for the present youth. The review notes that the scene does not give the kids a chance, making them voiceless and stupid citing unfairness and offense that the youth of today are portrayed as such a hopeless bunch. This reviewer misses the point entirely. This film is not about presenting us with fair portrayals of youth culture. It is about getting into Greenberg's head and seeing people as he sees them. These kids are not meant to represent youth culture; they are meant to represent how Greenberg sees youth culture. The scene is a brilliant one, rife with tension in a situation that would not normally carry it.

Greenberg's relationship with Florence could be the most frustrating aspect of the film for some but also the most rewarding. Mainly because of the way he treats her. While his mind bounces back and forth as to whether or not he wants to be with this person even casually, he drags Florence through every single back and forth moment he has, instead of keeping it to himself. He then proceeds to blame Florence for his feelings, telling her that everything he is conflicted about is her fault. His mood changes drastically within individual scenes with her. Florence, in the meantime, likes him a lot but is conflicted about him both because of his behavior and also having just come out of a long relationship. She also excuses a lot fo his behaviour because she knows about his stay in the hospital. Her best friend Gina, does not want her with him because of the way he treats her. Having also read complaints that Florence ends up simply catering to Greenberg's needs and is a weak character, there is a scene to counter that claim between Florence and Gina as we hear why Florence refuses to lose interest in him. She explains her choices and Greenberg is humanized enough for us to see why Florence makes the decisions she does. In addition to this, Florence has a breaking point proving she is not a character that can be constantlyy trampled on. This displays in part why Florence is not a weak character but an individual making a personal choice for better or worse.

The scene where Florence tells a story could be the most awkward, tense and hateful moment of Greenberg's behavior. Without going too much into it, as those who have seen it will know exactly what this refers to, it really shows Roger's impatience with others and how short a string his dissatisfaction with a conversation has. It is probably the moment people will hate Greenberg that most; at least it was for me. As for my reaction, it was the one moment that I said out loud in the theater ""Oh my God"". An overreaction? Probably, but it was a really surprising turn to a scene that started out on such good terms.

Greenberg's rare but genuine attempts at reconnection contribute to his humanization. His most desperate attempt to reconnect comes from his efforts at striking up a friendship and possible relationship with Beth (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an ex-girlfriend who he is clearly still thinks about. She has been through so much, a husband, kids and an impending divorce, that for her the relationship does not even feel like it happened. Her indifference towards him perfectly captures his mourning and hatred towards time and the things it can blur, distance and effect in so many ways as if nothing ever even happened. He really does try with her but it does not work and the scene with the two of them in the restaurant is painful to watch (there are a lot of painful scenes in this) as he talks to her about moments and days between the two of them which she cannot recall and does not seem to care to attempt to.

This is without a doubt Ben Stiller's best performance; a role that he was born to play (picturing anyone else playing Roger is impossible). He is stripped of extravagance and is not afraid to make Greenberg as unlikable as the script portrays him and succeeds beautifully in all the moments that Baumbach gives him to deepen the character, get in his head and show us through his face the pain, awkwardness and trouble he has functioning in society. Greta Gerwig is a real find. This is her first foray into the mainstream after being a hugely relevant contributor to the mumblecore movement. Last year she memorably played best friend Megan in Ti West's The House of the Devil and she has a rich career ahead of her. She is just as interesting to watch as Stiller and both actors make us understand why their characters do the things they do largely contributing to the film's success We may not approve but we understand. The two also have a great deal of what many on screen pairs fail to these days; chemistry. On a final note concerning the performances, Rhys Ifans is so good in this that by the end I wanted an entire film dedicated to Ivan as it becomes so evident that his story is merely touched upon.

Baumbach's direction is at turns observational and subjective. There are times when he takes a step back to let us see what Greenberg's interactions are really like, objectively letting us observe the negative effect and impact he has on other people. This allows us to view his current place in the world and to fully see why his cold and hateful behavior is not accepted in most social circles. Baumbach performs a balancing act with this and scenes where we are subjectively let inside of Greenberg's mind and shown exactly what he goes through in a social situation and how he sees everyone else. The scene that perfectly captures this is the first party scene in which Ivan and Roger attend a birthday party for one of their friends' children. Baumbach inserts a montage with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem's score pervading in the background, competing in the audio track with the dialogue taking place combined with quick non-linear cuts and portions of various conversations Greenberg has at the party. All of it equals an entirely overwhelming montage in the constant awkwardness of Greenberg's complete misfire in every encounter he has and the techniques that Baumbach employs through his use of editing and audio overload. He perfectly conveys Greenberg's subjective experience in social situations and through the effect this scene has on the viewer, we feel the way he feels involuntarily aligning us with the protagonist. The scene culminates in a stunning moment with an extended overhead shot of Greenberg alone but surrounded by children running around and adults stationed in stable conversation. He is lost, confused and unsuccessful in his attempt to function at this party through a combination of his own coldness towards others and his genuine discomfort with them.

We have come to the personal part of this review. Noah Baumbach is, for me, in the top tier of working directors and screenwriters not only in his own scripts but in his contribution to two Wes Anderson films. I adore every work of his because of his courage in the characters he writes and the way he challenges his audience to really dig deep into his examinations of upper middle class angst as he relentlessly enforces the validity of his characters' feelings. He knows that not everyone is going to relate to them and furthermore he knows that many are going to actively invalidate their plights through personal assertion. There is nothing wrong with this. Just because his characters can be difficult to relate to does not mean that they do not deserve to have their stories told. Films that are challenging in this regard are refreshing to me and much more interesting than the majority of work out there. He makes his characters ugly but valid and fully realized.

That is why I love Margot at the Wedding so much. Margot was refreshing for me personally because of how brutally unlikable she is. There is a difference between brutally unlikable and brutally uninteresting. In many writer's but more often studios' attempts to create easily marketable and relatable characters the result is many times a dull and redundant story. I am surprised by how many found Greenberg to be so completely intolerable considering that not only does the character grow by the end of the film but also because this film is so much more accessible in my opinion than Margot. Also, while Florence's actions might be questionable in her unwillingness to give up on Roger at times when you may want her to, she is very easily likable not to mention Ivan who is extremely easy to attach to.

I guess I am so deeply fond of it because Greenberg felt disturbingly relatable. Reviewers have referred to his character as a monster which is completely pushing the line. I find it interesting that people are much more inclined to accept the actions of characters that kill people in films before they can accept a character like Roger Greenberg. Greenberg is unlikable. He is stuck in a largely middle-aged conundrum; as Ivan (Rhys Ifans) talks about late in the film, he is incapable of embracing the fact that his life has not turned out as he planned, a problem which taken on its own should be relatable to many. His misanthropy and his disconnect from society and all of the things that make him so hateful to many others felt familiar to me in my own feelings, especially in his disconnect with the current generation which would be my own. Obviously my feelings are not nearly as generalized or unwavering as it is for him but I felt a connection with him to the point where by the end of the film I truly loved this character and outside of much of his treatment of Florence and Ivan, I cannot say his actions upset me all that much. I never approved of them but I was more fascinated by his actions than pissed off.

Greenberg's ability to openly show his disdain for everything, which is what turns so many people off from him, is an aspect I cannot relate to. However, in relation to my own thoughts at times, yes I do relate to some of the things he says. His experience in social situations feels eerily familiar. His concerns about middle aged life and the way he so fully feels the passage of time is something that I relate to in my youth which is just a little terrifying. Throughout the film all I kept thinking was that this film was not made for people my age; so why do I understand everything he is going through even if I do not relate to the way he goes about dealing with his issues. The film, which is alternately and much of the time simultaneously very funny and also very depressing felt relatable and true to me. While I am not at the age to fully understand that passage of time, opportunity and examination of self growth I felt a very strong connection making me one of the many that truly loved this film.

If everyone liked Greenberg the film would not be successful because that would mean that Baumbach had not stayed true to his title character. Greenberg will alienate some and unite others but through portraying a character fully and deeply on both the director's and the character's own terms whether or not people relate to it or sympathize with his plight enough to care about the film makes this a unique, brave and acutely observational character study that will be hated by many and cherished by many for years to come.",1296345600,21,15716,4.667268134247564

Screenwriter Noah Baumbach has served up a tale of a modern day misanthrope, Greenberg, convincingly played by Ben Stiller. We've all probably met characters like Greenberg in our lives and found them to be both fascinating and contemptuous. The question here is whether a screenwriter like Baumbach should place such misanthropic characters under the microscope and devote an entire feature length film towards exploring their many foibles.

Even if you can't stand the character of Roger Greenberg precisely because he is so unlikeable, I think that it's safe to say that Ben Stiller has done an excellent job in portraying this particular character type. He's actually a real person opposed to the dumb caricatures Stiller offered up in such sorry spectacles as 'Night at the Smithsonian' and 'Tropic Thunder'.

The plot begins when former musician turned part-time carpenter, Roger Greenberg, has just been released from a psychiatric hospital on the east coast after a 'nervous breakdown' and basically is invited to house sit his brother's plush Los Angeles home, while the family is away on a vacation in Vietnam. Indie newcomer Greta Gerwig plays the family housekeeper, Florence, who has been instructed to be at Roger's beck and call, in case he needs help around the house.

Florence turns out to be just as quirky as Roger and has no qualms about having sex with him despite having just broken up with a boyfriend. The sex between Roger and Florence is a bust, characterized by what one might term 'cunnilingus interrupt-us'. Somehow, Florence is willing to give Roger multiple chances since she sees in him a free spirit. Eventually, Roger makes it quite clear that he's not interested in any kind of emotional intimacy whatsoever and launches another one of his angry rants towards Florence, who finally realizes that she's been wasting her time trying to get involved with him. However, when Roger's brother dog, Mahler, gets sick, Florence is forced to spend time with Roger as they must go from one vet to another, attempting to find the right treatment for the stricken canine.

If Roger's concern about Mahler shows he's capable of some kind of empathy and he's also capable of displaying great contempt (as in the case of his rejection of Florence who craves intimacy), the relationship with his former band mate, Ivan, is more nuanced. It seems that Ivan still blames Roger for the breakup of their band twenty years earlier; Roger argues that the record label they were about to sign with wanted complete creative control which would have led to the dilution of their aesthetic vision. The point about these misanthropic characters is sometimes their societal critiques are spot-on. Yes, it's possible Greenberg could have been completely right about not signing with the record label. On the other hand, because they are so contemptuous of intimacy and relationships, Roger is completely intolerant of the idea that Ivan may be considering getting back together to his wife who he recently separated from.

Roger's cruelty is manifested in even higher relief when he looks up his old girlfriend, Beth, who has been trying to cope emotionally after a divorce. Instead of lending a sympathetic ear, Roger boorishly tries to put the moves on her just as they meet for lunch; it takes Beth only a scant few seconds to extricate herself from Roger's clutches after his crude come-on.

When Ivan and Florence have a bunch of waiters sing 'happy birthday' at a restaurant for Roger, he can't stand the idea of their thoughtfulness and storms out. Both Ivan and Florence are completely turned off by Roger's behavior and at this point, one wonders if most of the film audience have also become too alienated to care about Roger and his destructive misanthropy.

While Florence is in the hospital having an abortion, Roger returns to form as he ridicules his niece's college chums who have gathered at his brother's house for a drunken orgy featuring loads of alcohol and cocaine. Roger has a final falling out with Ivan who he basically accuses of selling out to middle class respectability. Ivan retorts that Roger's guilty of the ultimate insensitivity--disrespecting him after failing to ever visit his young son, while staying out in California.

Roger finally has an epiphany of sorts when he realizes that he's been insensitive to those who care about him and now must make amends. This takes the form of a mea culpa on Florence's voice mail and a visit to her after her release from the hospital.

I'm still wondering if Greenberg's tale was worth telling. Yes, I acknowledge that Mr. Baumbach's wry observations about the life of a modern day misanthrope are well taken, especially in depicting the character's wit. As a character portrait, Greenberg is true to life but is there really much conflict here? Except for the final showdown with Ivan at the film's climax, all the characters in opposition to Greenberg, end up slinking away from him due to his crass insensitivity. It's a hard draught to take when your main character's shtick is basic, non-stop hostility.

At a certain point, the novelty of a character like Greenberg wears off. This would be true in real life if you were to meet someone like Greenberg--despite the initial attraction, he'd end up insulting you and you'd end up disliking him intensely. And that's why Greenberg's redemption at the film's end doesn't ring quite true--real life Greenbergs always remain narcissistic as they equate intimacy and sensitivity with humiliation.",1296259200,,5571,5.024918743228603
4018413,5,B002ZG97T2,"I was suspicious of this film from the beginning.  When you work this hard on the DVD cover to make it look like a terrific viewing experience something must be wrong, right?  Well, yeah, something is...and all the one-star ratings here confirm that a lot of people spent time with this movie that shouldn't have.  It sure ain't for everybody.  ""Extremely entertaining"" it isn't, not for most.  And that whimsical Ben Stiller and beguiled Greta Gerwig you see on the cover...no, they don't show up in this film.  Not too often.

That said, I DID like this movie, an awfully lot.  Read some of the other reviews, pro and con, and you'll get it.  ""Big Ben Stiller fans"" need not apply...if that means you're huge fans of most of his films.  This isn't that.  But if you like quiet character studies of flawed people...if you enjoy films that don't follow some formula that has been beaten to death for a century...then you just might be in the right place.

Well, of course he does, he's human, he wants to have a nice life...even if he's own worse enemy.  But, jeesh, he can still hope.  We all can.

The only way to see this film without incessantly wincing is to climb into Roger's fragile neurotic shell for the duration. Good thing I saw it alone at home and not in a theater.

4018419,2,B002ZG97T2,"I did not like this movie. I strongly disagree with the critics quotes on the box that this is an ""entertaining"" since it is not. My main reason for not liking this movie because I don't quite understand where it was going and what it was trying to achieve.  A story should have conflict and resolution which this does not.

""Greenberg"" is about a 40 ish loser in every sense of the word. He has no accomlishments, sabotaged (15 years ago) a potentially rewarding musical opportunity (which indelibly harmed his bandmates), just emerged out of some type of mental health program, is not a loyal friend to anybody, is rude to younger generations, has no empathy to anyone he has intimacies with and, worst of all, thinks he knows more than the rest of the world. What he does not know, but the viewer does, is that the world really does not care that much about him.

Although I did not like this movie, the acting and characters are fantastic. Ben Stiller does a great job of playing a person who we have all seen before. The ""Greenberg"" character does not fall to stereotypes that you may see in mainstream movies, such as redemption, so it is hard to care and get emotional with him. Roger Greenberg is not likeable and he deserves the results of his bad kharma.

There are interactions among the characters (a current love interest, a college friend, a first love) that are very realistic and quite poignant however, the problem with this film is that the plot, dialog and conflict are not at all cinematic...the movie is boring. There's no tension, emotions, payoffs, etc. The movie is just a ""slice of life"" for a jerk character that you could care less about

Obviously, this is not a mainstream flick and it is aimed at the ""art house"" crowd yet, this movie does not really have much going on to hold the viewer's attention. There are a couple of wonderful and touching scenes wrapped up in a encompassing ""bad movie"".

Other than if you really have an interest in this because of the director, writer or actors, there is no reason to seek this movie out.",1293926400,3,2062,4.559459459459459

Baumbach's players probably improvise a lot of dialogue, and, while motivations may not always seem clear, actions are believable. There are no ""archetypes"" or ""sharply-defined"" characters, just people guided by habits and quirks. Ben Stiller's Greenberg will frustrate some viewers with his perverse way of pushing Greta Gerwig away. Some will want a hero whose actions make sense, but this is not a ""lifestyle"" movie. The characters seem alive as they go through trivial trials, like dealing with a sick dog. The movie lets us into an engaging LA scene and the lives of troubled people genuinely trying to cope with life, and ends as a strangely uplifting love story.

4018421,3,B002ZG97T2,"Greenberg is probably not as bad as most of the reviews claim it is. I mean, it has its moments. Rather, the obvious weak moments come in the way of Ben Stiller's character.

Throughout Greenberg, the segments that make me lose the most interest are *easily* the ones where it's all about Ben's character dragging on and on carrying utterly pointless conversations with himself that don't really do anything as far as storyline progression or (especially) something to trigger a response of ""laughter"" out of the viewers.

You see Ben's character is that of a 40-year old loner who has trouble speaking to people (especially women) because he's been so secluded and shut off from the outside world. So the main reason I'm giving Greenberg at least a 3-star rating is because the conversations he has with the women are usually fairly decent and funny. They too, however, drag at times. The movie honestly should have been about 45 minutes shorter.

I really don't think any of the scenes involving that German Shepherd were remotely humorous. They were not only overabundant, but just completely uninteresting.

I guess the main purpose of the storyline was that Ben meets a girl and a relationship develops, however it's definitely not what most would consider an ordinary relationship in any way, shape or form. She's almost as weird as Ben's character.  The scenes involving college kids unexpectedly partying at Ben's house and the way Ben communicates with the kids were just bizarre and out of place.

Not the greatest comedy in the world, but it won me over a couple times so I won't be giving it a really negative rating.",1293840000,,1629,4.862815884476534
4018422,4,B002ZG97T2,"As of this writing, there are 61 reviews of 'Greenberg'.  Ben Stiller plays the titular role, a misplaced and stunted 40-year-old whose growth as an adult seems to be stunted.  He's apparently had a mental breakdown at some point, and has been in a 'mental institution', though he is a fully-functional person who mostly had a bout with severe depression and/or a severe neurosis.

In any case, Roger Greenberg is a former Southern California transplant to New York, who comes back to LA to house sit for his brother and his wife.  He starts to re-connect with some of his friends and girlfriends, but also makes somewhat of a connection with his brother's assistant Florence (Greta Gerwig).

Greenberg is an immature man-child who has never grown up and taken responsibility for himself, preferring to coast through life not making much of an impression.  Meeting up with his old friends from his days in LA brings back some painful memories; he's still being blamed for costing his old band their big break by nixing a record deal.  The band broke up, and their uniqueness is gone forever, leaving bitter memories and the promise of riches laid to waste.  Now he wants nothing more than to drift through life, doing pretty much nothing.

Greenberg has a relationship of sorts with a much younger Florence, with much fits and starts along the way.  Greenberg is still sort of in love with an old flame, but she's sort of moved on.

Greta Gerwig's Florence is another character who doesn't know what to do with her life, so she's drifting too.  She's at least responsible, unlike Greenberg.

We do see Greenberg grow by movie's end, as he confronts his old band members, bares his soul to Florence, and takes increasingly good care of his brothers beautiful dog, Mahler.

This is a film that makes a subtle point about growing up and taking responsibility.  Greenberg always seems ready to fall off the deep end, using drugs and neglecting Mahler, but he does seem to right himself before all is lost.

Three-and-a half stars for the uneven, but quietly perceptive 'Greenberg'.",1293321600,,2077,4.824858757062147
4018423,4,B002ZG97T2,"Expertly occupying the space between dumbed-down mainstream comedies and hackneyed indie quirkfests, Noah Baumbach's ""Greenberg"" is a character study with a decidedly narrow focus, elevated by a mix of style and tone that defies easy classification.  The movie does contain its share of humor, and romance of a sort, but to call ""Greenberg"" a romantic comedy would be roughly tantamount to saying ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a horror movie because there are zombies in it.  Ben Stiller takes a break from starring in big-budget Hollywood productions to step into the role he was seemingly born to play as Roger Greenberg, an intelligent but unstable ex-musician and recent mental patient who journeys from New York to L.A. to build a doghouse for his vacationing brother.  While there, he starts a stormy relationship with his brother's twenty-something folk-singing assistant Florence (Greta Gerwig) while re-connecting with varying degrees of success with some of his former friends.  And really, that's pretty much all the plot there is, but Roger's general unpredictability and his halting path to redemption make for surprisingly riveting viewing.

There may not be a great deal of forward momentum or traditional drama in ""Greenberg,"" but if believable dialogue, relentlessly dry humor, and almost hilariously awkward sex scenes are your thing, you'll definitely find yourself in the right place.  Baumbach shows an admirable commitment to avoiding predictable character arcs and contrived plot developments, showing Greenberg at both his best and worst and forcing viewers to try to find sympathy for him in the quiet moments between his blowups.  While he's the kind of guy you want to root for, Roger certainly doesn't make it easy--as played by Stiller, Roger walks (and frequently jumps over) a fine line between ""endearingly quirky nonconformist"" and ""off-putting jerk"".  Stiller's performance does contain traces of the neurotic-nerd persona he's developed in countless better-known films, but there's an oddly alien aspect to Greenberg that conveys the impression of someone who doesn't quite understand social graces and has lost the will to try.

While there are some interesting side plots involving Roger's attempts to repair some of the damage he caused to his old friendships, his relationship with Florence forms the core of the movie and provides one of the more intriguing and offbeat romantic pairings in recent cinematic memory.  What makes Roger and Florence's bond especially interesting the is the way their differences in age and experience bring them together even as they provide a reliable source of conflict, with Florence's youthful naivety alternately complementing and clashing with Roger's world-weary cynicism.  What Florence finds refreshing about Roger--his aimlessness, his lack of ambition, his near-total lack of a social filter--would strike pretty much any normal viewer as more than a little pathetic, a gap that the movie exploits to full effect.  At the same time, Roger does possess enough intelligence and charm to make a relative stranger like Florence view him as an unconventional free thinker rather than a guy well past his prime who's pretty much given up on life.

While it's not entirely without flaws, the combination of the honest, unsentimental script and Stiller's revelatory performance are more than enough to make ""Greenberg"" one of the best movies I've watched all year.  The themes of alienation and stilted personal development occasionally bring to mind the work of Wes Anderson, albeit with less elaborate set design and a lot less emphasis on father issues.  In any case, those generally put off by both mainstream and small-time comedies should find a lot to like here.",1292544000,3,3736,5.3407155025553665

4018425,3,B002ZG97T2,"Noah Baumbach known for the film ""The Squid and The Whale"" wrote and directed this character study on a 40 something socially inept man. Ben Stiller plays ""Roger Greenberg"" in one of his best acting jobs to date. Greenberg has recently gotten out of a Psychiatric Hospital, but we don't know why he was there. He decides that a change in scenery would help him so he agrees to move to California to house sit for his brother. While there he meets a few people and reconnects with some old band mates. Sorry to say, that's it. There isn't much story here, it's just 107 minutes of Ben Stiller as Roger Greenberg being a general jerk to everyone. There is some humor and some drama, but I felt like this was a waist of time.

As a character study, this succeeds. We are able to see Greenberg at his most raw and vulnerable self. He is condescending, aloof and sarcastic, a role Ben Stiller was born to play it seems. Stiller truly ""wowed"" me, so on that side it's a hit. It was unlike anything I've ever seen him do before and he played it brilliantly. The problem was that I just didn't care about him. Sure it was nice to see Stiller play a different role than he is used to, but what was the point? I suppose it's that you do eventually see past his rashness and there is an interesting person there. But I still didn't care. I feel as if this was just a gift to Stiller so he could prove his versatility.

The director Noah Baumbach usually does movies I absolutely love, such as: ""The Squid and The Whale"" and ""The Life Aquatic, with Steve Zissou"". At least those movies had an interesting story and likable characters.

As the movie drags on we meet ""Florence"" Stiller's first love interest played by Greta Gerwig. She does a good job acting but like Greenberg, there is nothing really interesting about her. Greenberg meets up with some old band mates and an ex girlfriend. All of whom, while spectacularly acted, were just ""blah"" characters. They were just boring.

He moves to California to be with his brother and ends up having a romantic pairing with the brother's house sitter.

4018444,3,B002ZG97T2,"I was blown away by Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale, feeling that I ""got"" every scene and character interaction, but Greenberg is not so clean and tight as that movie.

Greenberg (Ben Stiller) has just gotten out of a mental hospital and is going to stay at his much-more-successful brother's house in L.A. while his brother goes on a vacation with his family. Left behind at the house are a dog with an immune disorder and the family's personal assistant, Florence (Greta Gerwig), with whom Greenberg will soon be having an affair. Even though she's 20-ish and Greenberg is in his 40's, she's been hurt by people her own age and so she thinks that maybe an older, mental-breakdown survivor might be just the ticket to a relationship that's about love instead of just sex. She couldn't be more wrong. Greenberg just wants to score, and then wants to get away from her as quickly as possible. But the dog, the dog and the fact that Greenberg hasn't driven since he moved from L.A. to New York make it necessary that he and Florence keep seeing each other.

Greenberg loves to write ""helpful"" letters to the editor, to Starbucks headquarters, to mayors, or to anyone else whose operation isn't running perfectly smoothly. It was probably this same outspoken ""helpfulness"" that, earlier in life caused Greenberg to screw up his and his band's chances for a deal with a record label. And though neither he nor his friends are doing that badly now (Greenberg's a carpenter), none of them are living their dream lives as rock stars and they never let him forget it. Being a far cry from what he could have been seems to have left Greenberg with self-esteem issues, social phobia, and agoraphobia. He's forever trying to avoid parties or any other cluster of people, and when he does find himself around other people he usually uses that opportunity to insult them.

Throughout the movie Florence gives him chance after chance to be a decent person and the movie seems to be about how we have to grow up and look at the good things that are offered us even if we didn't achieve the dreams we had as children.

4018474,3,B002ZG97T2,"There are any number of movies that have been made where the audience follows a character who is trying to work his way to normalcy after a tragedy or illness or some general misfortune. This is supposed to be one of those movies but it misses some of what makes watching them so rewarding.

Ben Stiller plays Greenberg who is recently out of a mental hospital in New York. He is house sitting for his brother in L.A. while is brother is out of the country on biz. Part of what he is supposed to do is build a dog house for his brother's dog. During his stay he starts up (sort of) a relationship with his brother's assistant who herself has some issues. So here we have two people outside of the ""norm"" who may or may not be able to fill the gaps in each others' lives.

No such luck. The movie may have more issues than the people it deals with. First, there's Greenberg. He's definitely an odd one, but why was he in the booby hatch? We don't know. And he's kind of a dick. He's mean to people. He has outbursts he can't control and it's difficult to empathize with him. The girl, played well by Greta Gerwig, is lost. She's out of college but has no idea what she wants to do and seems to have self esteem issues to boot.

The acting is good. The production values are good. The musical score and soundtrack are good. For my money the problem lies in the script. He's like a bomb that could go off at any time. How do you get close to someone who could go off on you for no real reason? Gerwig's character somehow rationalizes this figuring it's because he's deeper than other people. Maybe he is but if he can't function, he can't function. Why would anyone subject themselves to that? Too much is left in the air. Will he finish the dog house? Will he learn to control himself? You don't really know because the movie doesn't really end. It stops and doesn't give enough inkling on how things will play out.

It didn't hurt to watch this movie, but I could have done without it. The art of film making is no further along with its having been made.",1283817600,,2054,4.245524296675192

But if you can party with a dryly funny hangout film (made me think of a misanthropic Diner or Rio Bravo or something) you will be rewarded.

And it's not.  Stiller is a genius.  But even genius cannot erase a totally awful enterprise like this.  Move on, big river.",1281916800,4,468,4.168539325842697
4018501,3,B002ZG97T2,"I enjoy movies that push an envelope, and having been an institutionalized mental patient 40 years ago - as Ben Stiller portrays - I was eager to see how Baumbach would handle this after his the most excellent Squid and the Whale.
Ben Stiller is at his best, and certainly deserves kudos for his portrayal of this broken character. His weak ego structure cannot admit to any real fault, and this hovers around an annoying, narcisstic hypocrisy, in which he eagerly finds fault with everyone and everything around him.
""We never speak of anything good,"" his ex-friend tells him; and the perfect example is the friend saying
""This is probably boring to you, but you never made an effort to know Vic.""
""Who's Vic!?"" Stiller's character answers loudly and impatiently.
""My son,"" responds the old friend.
""Oh, I didn't recognize the diminutive,"" answers Stiller, continuing on offensively while ignoring the content of the statement.

The curious ending (you cant call it a climax) is his easily-made female love-interest stating ""this is you"" at the end as she prepares to hear the Voice-Mail he left her. In this, he admits to a certain vulnerability in his feelings towards her, and the previous scene with his friend Paul is where he bears what amounts to the beginning of a genuine responsibility toward his prior actions in that he states ""don't you think I would have done things differently if I could? And the admission that he didn't think he had the power to alter such things in life is a common thread in the tortured experiences of those who suffer personality disintegration after youthful exertions rendered great consequences.

The ending leaves one with a picture of Stiller's character. ""This is you"" she tells him. It's a ""you"" that hardly paints an optimistic picture. He has turned a VERY small corner. That much can be seen. Is it enough? For a character like Stiller, the easy on-again off agin sex with this girl certainly is enough for him to say ""I really like you; I'm sorry I did such and such."" The real test never comes. The references to shrinks are so embarrassing in their lack of deep therapeutic understanding or self-awareness that they become less than useless, leaving the viewer with the uneasy notion that the creators of this movie are still lost in the beginnings of self-awareness themselves; and therefore akin to a virgin writing about sex.

As a reintegrated ex-institutionalized schizophrenic, let me say Mr. Stiller's character has an extremely long road in front of him, and without criticizing the film's intention, it is such a very small step he takes toward self-awareness at the end that it leaves one wondering what point the film is trying to make vis--vis recovery.",1281916800,4,2718,4.891540130151844

I found it poorly written, and incredibly boring. Mediocre-to-poor cinematography doesn't help either.  If you want me to engage with a character's emotions & flaws, then give me a reason to do so.

4018503,4,B002ZG97T2,"Whereas someone like Steven Spielberg has achieved success because his films can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, Noah Baumbach is a director who has polarized audiences with each of his films, and this one is no exception.

The film follows Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller), a 40-year-old man who has recently suffered a nervous breakdown and is now struggling to just ""do nothing."" He returns to L.A., where he had grown up and had a semi-successful rock band, and housesits for his brother, Phillip (Chris Messina), while he and his family are away on an extended vacation. Greenberg meets his brother's assistant, Florence (Greta Gerwig), and begins a halting, awkward romance with her. He reconnects with his old band mates -- including Ivan (Rhys Ifans) -- who are still bitter about a record deal that Roger ruined 15 years ago. Roger also attempts to date Beth (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an old girlfriend, but she rejects him.

The film is unconventional. I do disagree, however, that everyone in this film is unlikable. Greta Gerwig is excellent as Greenberg's love interest, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh, Noah Baumbach's wife. The film is out of the mainstream, but when looking at all of the junk coming out of Hollywood these days, that is a good thing.

If you liked films like ""The Squid and the Whale"" or some of Wes Anderson's work, and you are willing to go in with an open mind, I recommend this film.",1281225600,12,1411,4.79835390946502
4018504,3,B002ZG97T2,"Greenberg disappoints. Sadly. I got the movie because I love Ben Stiller. Everything his hand touches seems to turn to gold - not this time though.

Watching it, I couldn't help but think of the parrallels between this movie and a book I read some time ago by Saul Bellow called Herzog . It was rambling and disjointed and it didn't really get anywhere - mired in the type of navel gazing many of these wanna-be media 'intellectuals' are prone to. Greenberg seems like that - with slightly more plot but.

The performance of Greta Gerwig was a plus. She seemed very likeable and real, and perhaps it is this more gritty - more real - Stiller that 'shocked' me. I'm used to the Celluloid Ben, where everything is hunky dory and at the end of the movie; everything is neatly resolved and everyone lives happily ever after.

Could this be the beginning of more grown up movies by Stiller? I certainly hope not. If this is any indication of what grown up comedy is meant to be then count me out. I do not need to be subjected to 90 minutes of drivel written by some writer going through a mid-life crisis and trying to work out his thoughts on film. I watch a comedy to be entertained. If I wanted to be depressed I'd read the papers. So please Ben, do more of the stuff we love you for.

Finally, this isn't a terrible movie, it's watchable. It is definitely not funny though and regardless of how hard Stiller has tried to save it, this is a forgettable movie.",1281225600,2,1458,4.369003690036901

He meets up with Florence, her brother's beautiful but insecure personal assistant, and calls awkwardly upon old friends with whom he has a chequered past.  They get together, but he's prone to self-sabotage and is not an easy man to be with. The film is intrigued by him, but perhaps more intriguing is Florence, and the most serious question that the film poses is what circumstances would allow her to fall for such a self-obsessed and neurotic man, and whether a relationship such as this one could possibly work out.  In that sense, the film seems deliberately structured as the inverse of the classic romantic comedy.  Where in the standard rom-com we usually know that the two leads are made for each other and want them to come together and it's just details getting in their way, here it's more like we see what's inevitable and we don't want it to happen and we watch almost in horror at the emotional train wreck we know is on its way.

A beautifully-filmed exploration of relationships and of the ways our pasts tend to define and color our present and limit possibilities, Greenberg will disappoint those who go into it expecting Ben Stiller to deliver the laughs.  This is closer to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reality-Bites/dp/0783227922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reality Bites</a>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-at-the-Museum/dp/B000NOKJC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night at the Museum</a>&nbsp;but it's much more a Noah Baumbach film than a Ben Stiller film, and it's  much more character study than comedy.  There are some painfully awkward and funny moments, but this is not the kind of laugh-out-loud warm-your-heart romantic comedy you might expect based on the cover and the coverage.  Stiller does deliver what may be the most nuanced performance of his career - Roger Greenberg is a kind of extreme variation on the self-deprecating and sarcastic but ultimately likable guy that Stiller tends to play.  But the real stand out performance in this film is that of Greta Gerwig, whose depiction of Florence is as intimate and raw as anything you'd find in, say, the early film work of John Cassavettes.  That shouldn't come as a surprise to those who've seen her in her ultra-low-budget film work, such as the intriguing but imperfect&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-Takes-the-Stairs/dp/B00125WAVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah Takes the Stairs</a>&nbsp;and in the mumblecore horror comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baghead/dp/B001ILHY3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baghead</a>; but here, where it feels less on-the-fly improvisational, with a script that's notable for its authenticity and economy, the performance is tighter and more nuanced.

It's clear the director, Noah Baumbach, is deliberately drawing upon the small scale style of the ulta-low-budget indie genre known as mumblecore, given his use of Greta Gerwig as star and Mark Duplass (co-director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baghead/dp/B001ILHY3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baghead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Puffy-Chair/dp/B002SAMMKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Puffy Chair</a>&nbsp;and the much more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyrus/dp/B0037QGRV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyrus</a>) as a secondary character.

The episode that, as it comes to appear, defined their relationships with the past could easily have been the subject of an early Baumbach film.

Ben Stiller's talent is wasted on an obnoxious character, and there is a woman he fancies who always sounds like she's falling asleep.  Also, it's set in L.A. but everybody wears sweaters as if they're living in Canada.  The plot meanders and the ending fizzles out.

Stiller is an actor best suited to comedy roles, in which his ability to make us laugh mitigates his tendency to be annoying. As Greenberg, a role devoid of humor, Stiller is nothing if not annoying. If that is what Baumbach was seeking, then he hit pay dirt with Stiller. But a little annoyance goes a long way, and here, in a film running an hour and 48 minutes, it seemingly goes on forever. It doesn't help that the other characters are uninteresting and that the story arc, if you can call it that, moves at a snail's pace on its way to nowhere.",1279411200,8,950,4.428571428571429

4018532,5,B002ZG97T2,"Director Noah Baumbach has consistently made films that study the human condition under different scenarios, some of which we may be familiar with. In fact, he is one of the few that doesn't take the commercial approach in doing so. His films ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005) and ""Margot at the Wedding"" (2007) are good examples of successful movies that explore dysfunctional relationships. ""Greenberg"" triumphantly follows this pattern, and takes a sincere and penetrating look at another group of people trying to find happiness in the weirdest of conditions.

Ben Stiller stars as Roger Greenberg, a troubled human being who was recently released from a mental institution. He is on the way to recovery, and agrees to temporarily move from New York to Los Angeles, to babysit his brother's house, while he and his family go to Vietnam for vacation. Everything is going well, until he apparently gets bored with his solitude. With all the time in the world in his hands and nothing else to do - other than taking care of the dog --, he decides to get in touch with his best friend in that city (Rhys Ifans) and his ex-girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh). He also tries his luck with Florence Marr (Greta Gerwig), his brother's personal assistant. All these relationships will be a true test for Roger during his recovery, and he may get more of what he is looking for.

Ben Stiller's performance reminded me to the one that he played in ""Permanent Midnight"" (1998), in which he was intense and unpredictable. Green berg is a man of many obsessions, one being his constant complaining to government and private officials in regards to things like he doesn't like. This film really captures this character's complexity, and we can identify with him, as well as with Florence, who is in a world of her own, too. The Blu-ray version of this film includes a making-of documentary, ""Greenberg loves Los Angeles"" feature, and a segment on Baumbach's approach to the film.

4018533,5,B002ZG97T2,"This is a Noah Baumbach movie.  People looking for a wacky, slapstick 'Night at the Museum' type kiddie movie should not go anywhere near this hard and piercing character film.

The tone and harsh reality of those films should give you a good idea of what to expect here.  The film has a number of uncomfortable scenes but they aren't played in a broad and obvious way as many other films might have done.  Greenberg seems very, very real.  The laughs earned by the film come from a very perceptive observation of a character who seems lost wherever he goes.

What Ben Stiller does with this role is a revelation -- he makes an audience sympathetic to a very unsympathetic character.  If a character like Greenberg has even the slight possibility of finding love and happiness then there is truly hope for us all.

Ben Stiller hasn't shown acting chops like this in years and it's very refreshing to see him take on an adult role for a change.

'Greenberg' is easily one of the best films of 2010 and will find a place on many Top Ten lists.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.",1278201600,37,1866,6.299212598425197

Written and directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale), Greenberg is an exercise in cinematic endurance that tests the audience's patience to the breaking point. How long you last will depend on how interested you can force yourself to be in the lives of Greenberg and the people he passes along the way.

4018536,4,B002ZG97T2,"3-D is the current big thing in the multiplex. Last year people paid  record amounts to see Alien Blue People in 3-D, this year people flocked to see Wonderland, Greek Gods and Dragons leap off the screen; with Living Toys, Piranha and Witches yet to come. People have always gone to the movies for spectacle.
 Historical and Biblical epics brought people into worlds beyond their imagination. Science fiction, fantasy and horror films are like shared dreams on the screen. Comedies delight with outlandish situations that could never happen in real life. And, perhaps, Hollywood's greatest special effect has always been supernaturally beautiful people in love.
 Yet there has always been another side to cinema: simple tales of ordinary people. Rarely have such films been the blockbusters. War, monsters, epic disasters...that is the stuff of blockbusters. But some have always been interested in the amazing opportunity to observe other people living, talking, brooding, celebrating...just living.
 One of the most acclaimed films of this kind is Louis Malle's My Dinner with Andre (1981). That's pretty much what the film was: two friends eating dinner. But their conversation was lively and entertaining. Issues of philosophy and morality and meaning were the subjects of this conversation between two intelligent and interesting men. People through the years have enjoyed their company.
 Not many people would seek out the company of the title character of writer/director Noah Baumbach's Greenberg (2010). Ben Stiller plays a forty year old man recenty released from a mental institution. He once had a promising career as a musician but argued his way out of a record deal. So he went into carpentry, but his aptitude for that profession seems marginal at best. The film observes Greenberg as he dog-sits for his vacationing brother in a beautiful home in the Hollywood hills.
 Greenberg is hostile, sarcastic and abrasive. His one hobby seems to be writing letters of complaint to newspapers, politicians and corporations that have offended him. He tries to reconnect with friends from his youth, but they have all taken on the responsibilities of families and jobs, leaving him behind. The one connection he is able to make is with his brother's personal assistant, Florence, a charming but insecure woman in her twenties (a winning performance by Greta Gerwig.)
 But Greenberg even sabotages his relationship with Florence, picking fights, criticizing her stories...just being a jerk.  When someone quotes to Greenberg the old line, ""Youth is wasted on the young"", Greenberg responds, ""I'd take that one further, life is wasted on people."" We see Greenberg abuse alcohol and drugs, enter a casual and thoughtless sexual relationship with Florence, neglect his responsibility to Mahler the German Shepherd....There are a number of awkward scenes in the film that difficult to watch. People might reasonably ask, ""I wouldn't want to spend time with this person in real life, why would I want to pay money to spend time with him?""
 It's a good question. I appreciated the reminder that there are some wounded people in this world that need help. Those people are also difficult to help. As Florence says in the film, ""Hurt people hurt people.""
 Those hurt, despairing, abrasive people need Christ's love.",1275091200,4,3313,5.233962264150944

Related to Greenberg so much.  Only one I may have related to more is Gerwig's character (though I'm a dude, sue me, haha).  Wish Greenberg had been nicer to her.  Don't get the low ratings here at all.  Maybe hit too close to home for some people?  Can't remember if his brother was older or younger, but it seems the trope is for the older brother to be the more ""successful"", ""normal"" one while the younger is the ""mess"".

However, this is not a ""dog movie"", despite Mahler the hound's importance to how the plot (such as it is) unfurls. Actually, it is hard to say what it ""Greenberg"" is at all, except perhaps a psychological (not thriller but rather) snoozer.

The writer and director, Noah Baumbach, thinks of Greater Los Angeles, Calif. itself as the chief character. There's some plausibility in that and -- let's be grateful -- L.A. seldom lets one down as a consciously intended element (rather than posing as somewhere else) in a movie. I grew up in Los Angeles County, first, as a poor white kid in the 1940s in the blighted, overwhelmingly black neighbourhood that Bell/Southgate/Watts together comprise, only later, to any considerable extent, Latino. Then the family, after many moves, settled in North Hollywood/Studio City, a really lovely part of Greater L.A., then, later still, in Long Beach (which I left for once for all in 1967 for the East Coast and, eventually, for Qubec). Long Beach, which is not a setting, either, for anything in this film, but similar enough to other L.A. turf, was a city that, back in the 1940s and 1950s, was the working bloke's modest equivalent of the wealthy folk's Malibu vacation playland, at much more affordable prices and with lots of Long Beach's own peculiar funk (such as that of the inimitably tacky Oogla Smith's variety). So, yeah, I do appreciate the film's urban-suburban Los Angeles setting that I experienced with such diversity earlier in life. For all of that, however, a film needs more than that to be of any wide interest to a large public.

The lead (and eponymous) human character himself, Greenberg (first name, Roger), of whom Ben Stiller probably makes as much of a good ""go"" as really likely at depicting, is a middle-aged, narcissistic, obsessive, self-centred, creepy, and maladapted nerd who irritates and/or alienates almost anyone else in the film. At least, on-and-off, Florence, a young woman of remarkable patience, puts up with Roger Greenberg graciously and amiably, at least much of the time. Some of the other characters would be much more fun in motion picture of less somnolence than in this one.

Thanks to Roger Greenberg's overall irritability and weirdness, as Ben Stiller plays him with those and other personality qualities, this film at least is not one of those many excessively laid-back, So-Cal reveries, although my testimony on that score is that I nearly dozed off, anyway, at several points during the course of the movie. However, ""Greenberg"" (the edition viewed on widescreen DVD being Alliance 114747) takes more than good casting and setting alone to save it from its inherent flaws. Although I cherish almost any movie with Ben Stiller in the cast, this one is only going to be in my home video collection very temporarily.",1457308800,,2940,4.945344129554656
