8018402,5,B0001YYNW6,"In 1984, Classic Disney Cartoon Compilations started to be released on video for collectors as part of the ""Cartoon Classics: Limited Gold Edition"". This Lineup was a success and Disney decided to continue this Series with a new lineup called ""Limited Gold Edition II: Cartoon Classics. Now, Goofy gets his own cartoon compilation video in ""The World According to Goofy"". This Tape along with any other Limited Gold Edition tape has the very interesting documentary at the beginning. This Tape includes:

Goofy's Glider
Baggage Buster
How to be a Sailor
They're Off!
Home-Made Home
Man's Best Friend
How To Dance

All of these cartoons are in my opinion Goofy's best cartoons, so this scores on my list a perfect 10/10. Highly Recommended!",1339804800,,739,5.049180327868853
