4853986,5,B005OKF1IW,My son loves Word World and it's really educational.  Sound it out has 2 videos in it with all the characters and multiple short episodes.  It's a great product for a toddler learning his letters and phonics.,1364860800,,208,4.594594594594595
4853987,5,B005OKF1IW,"How is it an animated duck can say the same thing the teacher does...but the duck is smarter?!  Obviously, so are the animators/creators of this product.  As I like to say, ""If it works, who cares who gets the credit!""  I recommend it highly.",1363737600,,242,4.454545454545454
4853988,5,B005OKF1IW,My three year old likes the characters and we like the content. My three year old has learned the basic spelling rules.,1361750400,,119,4.454545454545454
4853989,5,B005OKF1IW,"My  son age 1 3/4 and daughter age 4 1/2 years old love Word World! And what's not to love, it's a show that in my opinion demonstrates that learning to read can be so much fun! Word World teaches children letter sounds, how to build words, rhyme, and much more through encouraging stories and song. It's really awesome how it gives children a visual in how letters come together to form words. Both my children learn visually so this set has been a total joy to have.

On Sound it Out, there are over three hours of play to be had split up between two 90 minute discs. On each disc there are about 7 to 8 episodes as well as some special bonus content. A speaking of special content, there's even a fun little poster included with the DVD that you can hang up in your child's room.

Disc 1

 * Dog Wants to Play Ball
 * Pl-Pl-Plane
 * Pig's Big Moonlight Feast
 * Snug as a Bug
 * A Star is Born
 * Mail Mix Up
 * Playing Spies

Disc 2

 * Dog's Camping Adventure
 * Sh-Sh Shark
 * Back on Track
 * Princess Sheep
 * Boppin' with the Bug Band
 * Duck's Family Reunion
 * Pirate Ship
 * Get Your Coat

The stories were all different and each were a lot of fun. I like how my kids were learning about more than just about letters and how to put them together. But there's also good moral stories about sharing, friendship, solving problems, and so much more!",1352332800,36,1357,4.118773946360153
4853990,5,B005OKF1IW,"We are big fans of Word World in my house! My kids love the ""Build a Word"" song/dance and my kids were all so excited to get this collection for Christmas! It has one or two episodes from a different DVD we have but they are mostly ""new"" for us. All in all, it's a great show, a great set, and a great purchase!",1420156800,,311,3.875

4853992,1,B005OKF1IW,The content is great! I received the DVD case in pieces. The case was broken so badly the DVDs easily fell out and the back was cracked from the middle through the back. Very sharp pieces and dangerous for little hands.,1418342400,,219,4.365853658536586

4853996,5,B005OKF1IW,Word World is one of the BEST children's early learning programs EVER! PBS was foolish to remove it from their broadcast schedule!! My older granddaughter learned to read spontaneously and we credit Word World and Between the Lions as significant contributors.  Between the Lions was also dropped from PBS!  If you can buy these programs then do it!! My daughter and I are both teachers and wholeheartedly recommend these programs for early learners.,1410652800,7,450,5.1506849315068495

4854001,5,B005OKF1IW,"My 21 month old son has been watching Word World for 8 months now, and he goes bananas over the sight of it. I bought all 3 of the double-dics DVDs, about 48 episodes in total.  Because he gets to watch a few episodes at bed time, I've never had a problem getting him to bed... he volunteers. I do think it has helped him with his vocabulary... and ""word world' is his favorite phrase!",1397520000,,385,4.133333333333334

4854003,5,B005OKF1IW,"Even though the  Duck in this series has a pretty serious speech impediment, this has helped my daughter the most learning how the sounds of letters come together to make words! I love it, and I've been a die hard leap frog fan for 12 years!! Since my first moved up from watching Baby Einsteins :)",1394668800,,298,4.321428571428571
4854004,2,B005OKF1IW,This video entertains my toddler but it's not really as educational as I thought it would be.  I expected it to show far more words and sound them out clearly at a pace a toddler can follow.  We have a bunch of educational videos and some of the other ones we purchased are a lot better.,1379462400,,287,4.107142857142857
4854005,5,B005OKF1IW,"2 Discs and each one is about 90 minutes long, includes 16 episodes! I think this is great for helping children learn letter sounds and having each character made of the letters that spell the words is great! I have let it play in the back ground for my daughter since she was about 6 months old. Now at 1 yr she will sit and watch at least half an episode.",1378598400,2,357,4.042253521126761
4854006,4,B005OKF1IW,Bought this because my grandson (30 months old) was going on a six hour car trip  and this is his favorite TV show. It did and does keep him occupied in the car.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there was nothing new on it.  Same stories as seen on TV.,1374883200,,253,3.826923076923077

4854008,5,B005OKF1IW,"My daughter is three and loves word world we have a few different DVD's. This is one of her favorites. She loves to sound words out, mostly the beginning letters. She is a very curious girl and this show has taught her a lot of different words. She is three and can spell Rocket, if that isn't amazing enough. It is not the only word, Word World has taught her to spell a lot of words, just not sight words, we use Preschool Prep Co. for that area.",1368576000,,448,4.1022727272727275
4854009,5,B005OKF1IW,"Definitely a must watch for any child. Teaches spelling, letter sounds and words. The characters are fun and my 3 year old can't get enough of it!",1365811200,,146,4.444444444444445
