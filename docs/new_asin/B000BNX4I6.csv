8089981,1,B000BNX4I6,"I am a purple belt in Jiu Jitsu and a defensive tactics instructor for Law Enforcement, Bouncers, and Security personnel.  I was excited to find this video as I thought it might provide some new techniques or strategies that I could work into my game.  I was wrong...

Quality of production:  The quality of the video is poor.  It has uses numerous effects added in post production that detract from rather than enhance the video.  The color is off.  The sound quality below average.

Quality of instruction:  The techniques are basic, but a lot of material is covered at a very cursory level.  Key details are not emphasized and the progression of techniques is uneven.

Techniques:  The above could be overlooked, especially by an experienced practitioner, but the techniques presented cannot.  Sport Jiu Jitsu techniques are presented as street worthy Self Defense.  As someone who trains both, I can tell you that there is a clear and vital difference between the two that is apparently not recognized by the instructor.  For example, he begins the video by demonstrating Inverted Guard.  Seriously?  That is what he is going to show as basic Self Defense Jiu Jitsu?  It does not get better from there.

Conclusion: Take a pass on this one.  There a many better options out there.",1402876800,,1284,4.856481481481482
8089982,1,B000BNX4I6,"i study under gene for 6 yrs. he is all about the money. he dose not care weather u get better, as long as u pay. he never rolls with his students. and manlipulites his way for promotion.",1378080000,,187,3.9473684210526314
8089983,3,B000BNX4I6,"This dvd only focuses on ground defense, nothing of above defense. Which these skills are not what you be using in a real street fight, this is more of a sport thing rather true street self defense.",1353628800,,198,4.378378378378378
8089984,1,B000BNX4I6,"This is sort of a strange instructional DVD set.  It's not  bad information per se, more like just bad information for the stated purpose (""street"" self defense).  The premise that Simco continually stresses during the DVD is that you're learning to do BJJ against another guy who is doing BJJ in a street fight. Huh?  The only way this highly improbably scenario would occur today is if you got into a fight with a classsmate from your BJJ class.  The other 99% of the time, the guy is not going to be a BJJ player, but, rather, some combination of brawler, bully, and ex high school wrestler.

Secondly, Simco continually refrains, ""I'm going to teach you to tap him.""  Think about that.  Tapping is a sport-specific way of ending a match, not a way to end an altercation.  When you tap the guy with your gogoplata, does that mean the two of you then patiently untangle yourselves, and he walks away with a sheepish look on his face?  (""You got me.  Good one!"")  If he taps, and you release, as you would in NHB/BJJ, how do you know he's not going to attack again?  Also, why pass the guard?  Why break his hold and then go to knee-on-belly?  If you've broken his guard, walk away.  Don't climb back on him!  Do you want to explain to the police -- or to the judge -- that you escaped his guard, but then wanted to see if you could get an arm-bar from mount?

Some good points are made, such as the obvious mistake of fighting on your knees or back while on pavement.  However, the style of pure grappling espoused is for sport, not street fighting.  Even the Gracies, while attempting to establish the superiority of BJJ, used punches and kicks -- and they were on mats.  So, once again, this video only makes sense in the context of NHB sport.  Change the title to that, and you have a 3-star introduction to NHB.

For self defense, on the other hand, the emphasis should be on escaping, clinching, pavement-friendly take-downs, pavement-friendly attacks/sweeps, and soft-tissue strikes throughout.  If he's too far away to strike you, get away.  If he's close enough to strike you, clinch.  If you're clinching, don't forget that he has eyes, a nose, a neck, genit4ls and knees -- and that a hip throw or outside trip onto the pavement should disable him enough so that you can get away.  If you're on the ground, you can't stop when he cries, ""uncle!"" -- you need to continue until he's disabled enough for you to get away (read: unconscious or broken).

Finally, the dated and gimmicky production, as well as Simco's chatty, stammery style, is a turn off.",1189123200,18,2562,4.534934497816594
8089985,1,B000BNX4I6,"this is one of the worst videos on real world combat i've seen.  the techniques reviewed are very basic and, frankly, unrealistic for a street-fight situation.  i just think Simco doesn't have much to teach in this area (or in jiu jitsu in general).
if you are serious about no-holds-barred fighting, you are much better off getting the 'secrets of chute boxe' by the Rua brothers, who are accomplished NHB practitioners and reasonably good teachers.  for the disarming techniques and standing submissions, you are better off with a krav maga video, such as any in the 'Combat Survival' series.",1188950400,4,594,4.97979797979798
8089986,1,B000BNX4I6,"This one of the worst quality dvd's I have ever seen. Not to  mention this DVD teaches you very little about REAL ground fighting.
I have found that simco dvd's are all the same, so by the lowest priced one and you have seen everything he knows! To tell you the true I've been in some nasty fights and I've seen alot more of them. The one thing is that I have never been in or seen a fight that men mount each other like that-- ever! you want to really see what happens in ground fighting ,watch the WWF on friday nites. As for This DVD, save your money for something ALOT better!",1182211200,2,580,4.087719298245614
8089987,4,B000BNX4I6,First off let me say that I am a Gene Simco fan. I really like the guy. This however is not his best dvd. It has Gene Simco in it so of course it has good info on jiu jitsu. It has really crappy music and weird colors though. Like sometimes the whole screen has a red or yellow tint to it for some reason. It is kinda distracting. However the meat and bones of the dvd is good. It will help you more if you already know some basic jiu jitsu but it's also fine for anyone. I am gald that I bought it.,1179100800,4,499,3.761904761904762
8089988,5,B000BNX4I6,"I have bought and viewed many Jiu-Jitsu DVD's over the past years and the one I bought ""Jiu-Jitsu for the streets"" is unequalled! In fact I have just ordered online the other 2 DVD set (such a great price!) called ""Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu"" and I want to thank Gene Simco for providing such quality instruction! The moves exhibit excellent flow patterns and are extremely functional, and reliable. Not to mention these LEG LOCKS!... Each technique is shown from initiation to a finishing move. While each scenario has a smooth flow, the moves progress in intensity in a way that can be stopped at the point where the situation has been neutralized. Whether you are using the DVD for self-study, review, or to augment the training materials of your own style, this is definitely a good investment.",1163030400,13,791,4.866666666666666
