7977691,3,B00007KLDI,"I enjoyed this video, though I've paid alot less for her other videos that had the same material, just different outfits and background.

This is a perfect video for dancers/exercisers looking for something a slightly different from their regular routine.  As a bellydancer, I would place its level at Advanced Beginners or Beginning Intermediates - for those who can really adapt to combinations and sequences without it being to challenging.

This video will probably bring your heart rate up for a slight cardiovascular workout, and most people, I believe, will enjoy the workout.

I do think that it was too pricey, but I was buying it for instructional purposes.  It is perfect for those wanting a unique routine that may be integrated into any other exercise routine.

I think the location and sound were perfect.",1125964800,9,819,5.029629629629629
7977692,4,B00007KLDI,"O.K., yes, Rania is generally an annoying instructor and her dancing can be stiff at times, BUT if you can look past that and just concentrate on doing the workout, it really is a lot of fun.  Her workout videos are some of my favorites because of the way that she creates a cardio workout sequence that is fun to do and keeps you moving.  And if you have seen her Natural Journeys video series, I can tell you that her most annoying qualities in those videos (her slack-jawed expression while staring at herself in the monitor alternating with looking like an adult film star) are actually toned down quite a bit in this one.  If I had seen this video first, I wouldn't have found her nearly so annoying.  This video is also a little longer and is more of a workout than the 30-minute Natural Journeys videos, which I think is a good thing.  Though the quality is amateurish, that doesn't take away from the workout itself.  The setting is a beautiful walled garden and I really like the almost disco-style dance music.  The video is a bit pricey, but I think those who take a casual approach to bellydance and just want to have fun and try something different will enjoy it.",1105660800,9,1176,4.441860465116279
7977693,3,B00007KLDI,"As a fellow belly dancer, I love Rania.  BUT, this video was not worth the money.  She does a drum solo at the end, that is actually Jillina's (If you want to see a pro - get Jillina's DVD set).  Her performances are much better at the end of her (fitness)other videos.  There is, however, a great tummy section, and she does break down some of the moves well. I just don't think it was worth the $35.00 I paid for it.",1075852800,10,418,4.060975609756097
7977694,1,B00007KLDI,"You might want to second-think carrying this video or any others by this woman...she is beautiful and sexy, but her dancing is laughable...which I would have done, except
I actually paid money for this video. This is one of the worst instructional videos I have EVER seen! Two of the background dancers are MUCH better than the ""instructor"".
The Veena & Neena videos are high quality with only a couple of questionable techniques...the ""Goddess"" instructor is a yoga person who took a few bellydance lessons...she sucks at bellydance. The Rania videos are a rip-off to the dance community. Even if I knew nothing at all about bellydance (I've been bellydancing for 25 years),I still would have been horrified by the stiff jerkiness of this woman's dancing. She has no business passing herself off as an instructor.",1041552000,19,814,4.992647058823529
7977695,5,B00007KLDI,"I just loved this video. I don't know exactly what to say. I am an intermediate dancer and although it covered the basics,I  found many things challenging and I like Rania's style and choreography. Also I like the music and production quality and the show at the end. This is not a video that will sit on a shelf. It is a value for the money.",1041292800,5,342,4.181818181818182
