2274135,5,B0009A40JI,"Dead Meat is a great example of how a talented director can make an effective zombie/horror movie on absolutely no budget.

Written and directed by Conor McMahon and set in Ireland, there's really nothing out of the zombie norm here to set it apart storywise. As it goes, farmers have been feeding ground up animal parts to their cows which has led to a strange illness. Strange illness leads a cow to attack a farmer which leads to zombieism. Okay, I admit it's a little corny, but as long as the movie delivers some thrills before it gets to the end I'm not going to nitpick over how the virus gets started.

The main reason this movie worked for me was because the writer/director didn't try to make another in an overlong line of Dead Alive/Shaun of the Dead slapstick, ultra-gore, zombie knockoffs, but instead decided to make an old fashioned zombie horror movie. Relying heavily on camera angles, lighting and shading instead of jokes and cheap jump scares to create tension worked for me. At times Dead Meat reminded me, and this is a good thing, of Night of Living Dead. While the low budget was obvious, there was a goodly amount of gore and there was also a sense of suspense and atmosphere that helped to make me forget anything else.

Oh, Dead Meat also has a zombie cow and how many other zombie movies can say that?

I recommend Dead Meat only to fans of the genre. And to anyone who buys this movie, be sure to check out the extras and the director's short film, The Braineater. It's great!",1297814400,,1506,4.5054945054945055
2274136,4,B0009A40JI,"Written and directed by Conor McMahon, Dead Meat (2004) is a fast-paced, suspenseful, and well executed zombie flick, that builds up to a frenzied finish in a castle turret.  The film is set in the Irish countryside, where cattle affected by mad cows disease, are the cause of the zombie outbreak.

The story follows Helena (Marian Araujo) who is travelling with her boyfriend along a country lane, when their car rams into one of the undead.  Stopping to help the injured man, her boyfriend Martin (David Ryan) is bitten by the zombie, and soon Helena is fleeing across the Irish moors with several zombies on her trail.  She encounters Desmond (David Muyllaert) a gravedigger, who fills her in on current events.  On their way back to Desmond's cottage, they encounter zombies roaming the countryside.  The gravedigger wields his shovel, while Helena employs her high heels, to dispatch the undead.

Together with a young girl (Kathryn Toolan) they rescue, the survivors hook up with coach Cathal Cheunt (Eoin Whelan) and his wife Francie (Amy Redmond), who have a working SUV.  Learning from a radio message that the Government will be picking up survivors at a nearby castle, the group heads over there hoping to be rescued.

Dead Meat features most of your standard zombie clichs, although these zombies are mostly silent and don't move at great speed.  There is no shortage of zombies, as lots of extras were employed, including many children.  The undead are mostly dispatched up close and personal, via shovel, wooden bats, or various hand tools.  The film is nicely atmospheric, and moves along at a nice clip, with little surprises along the way that raise the level of excitement, including an unexpected encounter with a very aggressive cow.  Many in the cast may not have much acting experience, but the performances very good.  The characters act and sound like real people, not endlessly arguing about what to do, or getting hysterical.  The finish is a bit over the top, as vastly outnumbered, the survivors battle furiously against a horde of zombies in an ancient castle fort.  The epic struggle goes on much longer than it should, but the carnage is bloody good fun.

The film has subtitles, and unless you are really familiar with Irish vernacular, you may want to turn them on, as Eoin Whelan speaks very fast at times, and barking out his lines, his heavy accent is often hard to understand.  That's about the only distraction in what is a tense horror thriller, with solid production values and decent special effects and gore, despite a low budget.  In pure indie tradition, the film's rousing closing song Dead Meat is written and performed by David Muyllaert.",1297641600,,2685,4.913525498891352
2274137,3,B0009A40JI,"Mad cows turn people into zombies. Not a bad idea, but not original either. This was an ok foreign attempt at a zombie movie. It will not sit well with people who hate low budget films. If you love low budget horror than this is just ok. There could have been more and there was some great scenes in this movie. It just lacked more zombie action and the characters were a little bland. I also loved that this zombie flick occured in a country side. It just seems creepy and you would expect zombies to pop out at you in a country side. The fact that this movie is from Ireland is the reason I purchased this film. I had never seen a movie made in Ireland by Irish film-makers. I just wanted something different. Even though the accents are heavy it seemed like a typical american zombie movie. Nothing out of the ordinary typical low budget horror film. I don't know I was expecting a culture clash something unique. The movie is better than most low budget horror films but it is not the greatest. If the price is cheap and you have a free weekend, then give it a try.

2274146,3,B0009A40JI,As far as cheaply made zombie movies go this one is not too bad.  It avoids going campy or the cheap comedic nonsense that many similar movies of this type try.  The special effects are not bad (although the zombie cow attack is kind of lame). It is an Irish production and they have wisely added subtitles in case the Irish brough gets too thick for you to understand.

2274147,3,B0009A40JI,"Dead Meat (Conor McMahon, 2004)

Yes, it's true: every country on the planet, with the possible exception of Togo, has now made a zombie movie. Dead Meat hails from Ireland, the land of such incredibly scary things as William Butler Yeats and St. Patrick. Never fear, though; Conor McMahon (since responsible for the must-see short The Blaxorcist) isn't trying to scare you. Not really, anyway. The humor in this movie is usually a lot lower-key than we've gotten used to in zombedies, but rest assured it's there.

You'll recognize the plot from a number of other, mostly more recent, movies; a mutant strain of mad cow disease gets into the food supply and causes human beings to turn into zombies. (For an even funnier take on this conceit, check out Johnny Kalangis' movie The Mad, which I cannot praise highly enough.) As is usually the case with zombie movies, the populace then gets divided into two segments--the living dead and the survivors. The living dead want to eat the survivors, while the survivors want to stop the living dead from eating them.

Pretty basic stuff. And, honestly, it doesn't really help that most of the people involved in this production were not professional actors. (Or, as some wags would undoubtedly say, even amateur actors.) And while McMahon is brilliant at directing shorts (his second-longest movie, the documentary My Daughter Does Madonna, runs fifty minutes), the jump to feature films does require looking at pace in an entirely new way, and the movie has a number of problems in that regard as well. Make no mistake, Dead Meat is not as good as most zombedies out there, but then it was also made on a fraction of the budget given to the best of them, and that labor-of-love feel really comes across. I know I've said this about a lot of movies recently, but you have to take Dead Meat for what it is in order to appreciate it; it's not meant to be Citizen Kane, and if one watches it with that expectation, one is in for guaranteed disappointment. On the other hand, if you compare it to other microbudget horror comedies, of which there have been a slew over the last decade or so, it acquits itself rather well in some ways and doesn't hold up in others; in that regard, it's just like (almost) every other decent microbuget horror comedy out there. If that's your thing, then by all means give Dead Meat a try. If you're not sure, see if you can hunt down some of McMahon's shorts first to get a sense for the guy's directorial style, and graduate upwards. ** ",1238371200,,2513,4.640449438202247

2274150,4,B0009A40JI,"Dead Meat was a very watchable zombie movie. Its nice to see what these movies can do with an actual budget and creativity. The movie takes place in the countryside of Ireland (I think) and basically there was a zombie outbreak due to some sort of mad cow disease mutation. A couple of people and a horde of zombies, just like it should be. There were numerous great/hillarious scenes (i.e. zombie in the wedding dress, hoover zombie, zombie cow, etc.) Now it's no Romero flick and surely isn't going to win any Oscars but it is a good flick none the less. I even purchased it. If your a fan of the zombie genre this one is very well worth it.

2274151,4,B0009A40JI,"Look, man---you work hard, you gotta play hard, you gotta eat hard.

They're not lying when they say it's a jungle out there: you've got Carruthers slippering up the greasy pole with murder in his eyes and a knife in his teeth, 250 pounds of burning ambition fixed on your job & office.

And it's not even that great of an office: a few plastic-metal cubicle walls stuck together with some fuzzy carpet superglued across the panels. And let's not even talk about the deadlines, the quarterly goals, the beatings administered by senior management in Dread Room 101, the Commute to your cheerless tract home in some nameless, Godforsaken burb.

My point: you work hard, you gotta eat hard. You gotta have RAW MEAT to fuel your toil, and this tofu-veggie crapula everybody's touting nowadays just won't cut it.

In the meantime, even scarfing down that Double Cheeseburger with the Works has become a life-or-death proposition: a vicious strain of Bovine Spongiform Encephalits---or Mad Cow Disease, as it is called for its brutal, brain-busting effects on Old Bessie---is sweeping throughout Europe, which welters under the smoke from a million pyres devouring the bones of cows and sheep.

Take ""Dead Meat"", for instance. Big goopy Irish horror flick, good solid pacing, lots of chewing and throat masticating and all kinds of good, solid stuff. This one gets to work with minimum fuss or muss with a nasty, weirdly claustrophobic encounter in a dark & spooky barn between a farmer and his, uh, moo-cow.

It's at that point when you realize: Holy God! These cows ain't just mad, they're P*SSED!

Faster than you can say ""two all-beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese tomato onions on a sesame-seed bun"" two hapless tourists motoring through sleep & bucolic County Leitrim, smack into some ambling fool on the roadway, try to get him in their nasty little English car to take him ""to hospital"", and wind up getting the Irish zombie version of Open Head Surgery.

Man, is any place safe when it comes to tourism these days?

The rest of the flick is pretty simple: survivors of Zombie apocalypse run, bunker up in cottages & ruined castles & woodlands lees, get eaten, get chunks wripped outta them, face death from unhappy zombie moo-cows, unleash some Irish whupa** on Zombie tush, and fall in love.

Kidding on that last one.

Look: this is a low-budget zombie flick that positively wallows in its beer-budget origins and director Conor McMahon has has enough cinematic moxie to really give this one some punch---particularly in these gorgeous, eerie tracking shots that stalk the characters through the woods, into cottages, peer through keyholes, through gaping panels: the triumph of ""Dead Meat"" is it brings back some of the renegade, guerilla filmmaker goodness---and eeriness---of Romero back in his salad days.

To sweeten the deal, you get McMahon's directorial debut, the indie short ""The Braineater"", which is insane, vile, and foul: more than enough to warrant giving the ""Dead Meat"" DVD a shot.

It's a slow start, a somewhat better middle and a crappy ending. There nothing I can remember as being a memorable death scene or even a quotable line other then a Scottish guy saying F### and C#### a bunch of times.

Zombies being slayed by twigs and high heel shoes thrown like ninja stars is over the top; but I failed to laugh... the whole movie doesn't set up a laugh factor to fit into it well. I guess some people love zombie movies that aren't comedies and that might be a reason some people here say its better then I say it is.

The director moves his camera around constantly; as a result, it's shot with more style than most SOV flicks. The zombie make-up is passable. Gore FX are good and plentiful, but the idiotic comic book way the heroes kill some of the zombies knocks the film down a peg (such as the heroine throwing her high-heeled shoe into the eye of a zombie). There are some major inconsistencies in zombie mythology: The heroine bites a zombie on the ankle to get it to let her go -- why isn't she infected? Why does the zombie react to such a minor wound? Many zombies use weapons (yet none can figure out how to break into a car), and one runs away to avoid getting killed! Dead Meat alternates between taking itself too seriously and not seriously enough. This ends up being its major flaw (that and sometimes the accents are so thick you can't understand the actors). The film is jam-packed full of zombie action so you won't be bored. I'm looking forward to seeing the director's next film; he shows a lot of promise.

It's hard to think of this set-up as being anything but a rip-off of 28 DAYS LATER with cows instead of monkeys being the initial carrier of the infection.

So this bovine infection starts causing people to attack each other in rural Ireland. Maybe I'm just getting numbed by all the zombie movies, but this one seemed like a weak attempt to capitalize on the zombie craze. Unfortunately, I think that the expiration date on zombie movies may be coming soon, if it's not already passed.

There's one pretty good moment where this girl sucks out a guy's eye with a vacuum cleaner, but otherwise this is a pretty standard zombie flick. You just can't make the same old zombie movie and expect people to be scared. You have to find a way to make it unique. Look at poor George Romero, who returned to the genre that he helped create, only to find mediocre box office success. As much as I hate to admit it, it might be time for filmmakers to take a little break from zombie movies, at least until they can find a fresh approach.

Of course, they're high on some fine Irish ganja and start making out while driving.  While these hippies are making their dirty love, their car nails a pedestrian.  The male hippie exits the car and proceeds to have his neck chewed apart by the pedestrian who just so happens to be a zombie.  The male hippie then does something very much against his tree-hugging hippie nature:  he goes and gets his Club(not a wooden stick but the red metal thing that hippies put on their steering wheels)and proceeds to utterly smash the living crap out of the zombie's head.  Then the male hippie turns all zombie and goes after his girl.  She runs to a nearby house and eventually kills him, very inventively, with a vacuum cleaner.  And all of that is only in the first five minutes or so of 'Dead Meat'.  The hippie chick then meets up with a young farmer.  They kill some zombies then meet up with some crazy old guy, his mongoloid wife and some random little fat girl.  The five then start trying to make their way out of the zombie infected countryside.

The movie has zero character development and not much plot other than the hide, be attacked by a zombie, kill it, then run, hide, repeat.  Thats the basic gist of the film(and most zombie flicks for that matter).  There are some things that standout though in this flick that puts it above much of the other low budget horror that floods the market:  the camera work and cinematography are excellent, the performances are good, and the gore is inventive.  Plus, its got killer freaking cows in it and thats just awesome.

But the best part of the film is that of the crazy old man named Cathal.  He's old, crotchety, and picks fights with everyone constantly.  He's a bitter old bastard but just hilarious.  He takes so much joy when he gets to hang out of a moving minivan and literally knock the jaw off of some zombie woman with his old cricket mallet.  He's actually very, very funny.

So with its likeable actors, fun gore, fast-paced plotting, and evil cows, 'Dead Meat' overcomes its small budget and paper-thin storyline to make one of the more memorable horror flicks that I've seen a quite a while.  Definitely worth seeing.",1128124800,3,2528,4.545454545454546
2274163,2,B0009A40JI,"Two stars for effort alone as these guys got off their backsides and just did it. Saw this at London's frightfest and was torn with a sympathetic view of the young and inexperienced filmmakers genuine efforts and what in the end was a bad film. Its poorly acted and has little in the way of new ideas, its saving grace was the addition of a totally over the top character whose dialect was so strong and incomprehensible it added to a manic performance and some genuine laughs.  As always with low budget films the difference between good and bad are ideas, this sadly didn't have any. Don't be fooled by the initial reviews seen on Amazon, this isn't a gem waiting to be discovered.",1128038400,2,683,4.508064516129032
2274164,4,B0009A40JI,"Attention zombie film fans--check this one out!  While on a low budget, this film succeeds on many levels important to a good zombie flick:

First, and most importantly--the suspense is consistent throughout the movie.  The characters are constantly on the run as attempts to rest are rudely interrupted.  If only the Dawn of the Dead remake managed to maintain its suspense after the electrifying opening scene!

Secondly, there is an element of believability as the characters are thrown together as they try to survive.  The remote & rustic Irish landscape adds to the creepy charm of the film.  There are no modern conveniences so the characters must defend themselves with whatever is at hand.

Third, the zombie encounters occur in a variety of frightening environments--wide open countryside, stuck in a car(talk about claustrophobia!), in a pitch black forest, inside a house, etc.

Fourth, the characters must kill someone they love who is now a zombie.

Aside from these factors, there is some intentional laugh out loud humor and good acting.

The low budget aspect of the film was most evident in the rather poor zombie makeup.  Some scenes were unintentionally (I think) comical--killing a zombie with a high-heeled shoe?  C'mon!  Also, the film seemed to end rather abruptly but left the door open for a sequel.  I say give this director some cash and let him make a higher budget sequel! I liked this better than Shaun of the Dead.",1127088000,4,1446,4.966666666666667

That's not important anyway. Let's have some zombies chasing some living people ... and let's have some social commentary along the way!

The social commentary is excellent.  The ending in particular is thought-provoking.

I have to admit that I had a lot of trouble understanding the coach, who is a significant character.  I even tried (unsuccessfully) to turn on the subtitles to figure out what he was saying.

That's my problem, though, and not the producers'.  DEAD MEAT is a creative, creepy flick, well worth the purchase price.",1125100800,3,687,4.811965811965812
2274168,4,B0009A40JI,"Although not perfect, this is one of the better and more original stabs at doing a low budget Zombie film today.

Good tension scenes and a serious tone unlike the ""witty and funny"" zombie films that the independents seem to feel compelled to make these days.

2274169,3,B0009A40JI,"You would expect just by the title, another Zombie type B film. But this one has a different touch to it; and is not a ""B"" film. With the scare of ""mad cow"" disease out there, this is a timely subject. Cow's become infected when fed animal parts illegally. The residents wake up to find several people have been attacked by these animals and picked up the disease. The one differance in this film is the change of background. Ireland has much history; it's old castles, buildings, and country side. This certainly makes a differance in the film itself. Most of the film takes place during daytime, where you would think the scare factor would be far less. With the atmosphere and the dreary backgrounds it makes this film enjoyable to watch. Not your classic horror, but certainly something different with regards to your average zombie film.",1124755200,2,842,4.73469387755102

2274171,4,B0009A40JI,"....made to be a Zombie flick. There is plenty of blood, decapatations, gore some cool humor and a ton of zombies and action. While the make up is not great thats not a real factor as the movie was just good with a cool plot and everything falls in place. While a bit short at only an hour and 15 minutes I would have liked this movie to go on as I was enjoying it alot. A true zombie fan will  appreciate this flick as it IMO is one of the better Zombie movies I have seen. Like I sdaid besides the applied Zombie make up which is not really good but not terribly horrible just ok for a low  budget flick.

2274174,1,B0009A40JI,"When I first read all the reviews people on amazon.com said about this film, I was interested in it.

I liked the fact the zombie virus was spread through mad cow

disease.

That premise made sense and was believable.

I went to blockbuster and rented the film and watch with some friends.

Going into this movie I thought I would see a serious horror film with some frights.

Instead what I got was a cheap gag-a-minute misdirected Irish film.

It doesn't matter to me where a movie comes from as long as it delivers.

This movie delivers nothing but trash.

From the ridiculous looking so-called zombies to the annoying Irish man and his zombie-looking wife (you can not understand a word he says in the film)

the so-called special effects in this film are horrible and looked extremely fake.

The so-called effects in this film were just straight out dumb and unrealistic (I did not know a regular household vacuum could suck out someone's eyeball from the socket???).

There were also 2 scenes copying ""Day Of The Dead"" :

1. Using a shovel to cut zombie's head in half from the ground.

2. Chopping off a bite victim's arm before the virus spreads throughout the body.

The movie just seems lost and how about the stupid scene were an actual mad cow/mad zombie cow attacks the car and eventually kills the wife.

Let's not even mention the ridiculous baseball to the eye gag that was so corny.

The acting in this film was also very bad, especially the zombie in the car biting the man at the beginning of the movie.

I didn't know to laugh or cry when I saw that.

This movie is not a classic nor for that matter halfway decent.

Be very careful when trying to find a good horror movie.

My search continues because you never know when you'll find that diamond in the ruff being a low budget B-movie (Zombie 1980) or higher profile big studio release (Dawn Of The Dead 2004).

Dead Meat however was just a big disappointment.",1120089600,5,1932,4.523121387283237

8058632,3,B0009A40JI,"The movie i thought was going to be a story,similar to Dead Alive or Undead(in the sense it's somewhat of a foreign film,because it takes place in Ireland) But the movie starts off with a mad cow outbreak causing mass outbreak.
Two people are rolling up the countryside just bickering and such,then out of nowhere *bang*  they hit a zombie.
So the boyfriend steps out and gets lunged at and attacked,he picks up his steering wheel club & beats the slow moving zombie to death. Then he gets infected,she has to kill him. The kills are all pretty generic seeings as i have seen it all,but the girl meets up with another real person who is the towns gravedigger. They meet up and travel the countryside up the road for miles,encountering and beheading zombies as they go. Then they run into a little girl who seems a little off to me(and with good reason,you'll see)
After they find the girl they come across a drunk irish guy and his nurse wife or girlfriend,they hitch a ride but not for long. They get in an accident and then there introduced to zombie cows....yea zombie cows. Then it moves forward til' just her & the gravedigger have a final stand with the swarm of ever increasing zombies move in for the kill. The haz-mat crew comes and shoots the zombies dead. Then they take survivors and cart em off to a death camp. B grade movie i know,but it just didn't have an ever increasing story or anything insane to make it real over the top interesting. It's a generic B film with no real catchy story(that you don't already know) and weak gore. It's okay,nothing special.",1402444800,,1574,4.52280701754386
