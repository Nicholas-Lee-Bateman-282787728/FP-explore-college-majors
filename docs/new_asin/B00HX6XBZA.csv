8637072,5,B00HX6XBZA,"5 stars for content as described in the Ray Harwood review.  The dvd I received however would not fast forward or rewind as it were.  If I tried to scan back a few seconds to re-watch something, the disk would jump back to the beginning of the track.  They sent me a replacement dvd but it does the same thing so don't be surprised if you see this problem.  Otherwise A+.",1433980800,2,371,4.183098591549296
8637073,5,B00HX6XBZA,"I own four DVDs from the Stan Winston School of Character Arts.  Every one of them is fantastic!  Each instructor walks you through every detail of each subject, and this is no different.

3D printer knowledge is obviously a plus for this one, but if you're just thinking of getting into 3D printing -- this DVD might put you over the edge!

The instructor uses an early version of 123 Design from Autodesk. The current version of 123 Design doesn't have some of the features he uses... features which really are (in my opinion) essential to doing this sort of 3D design.  Instead, I used FreeCAD to create my own design after learning the essentials from the instruction. See photo I've attached.  I designed and printed this on my Lulzbot TAZ 4 printer!

I'm planning to create an animatronic dragon to sit on my shoulder at the Phoenix Renaissance Fair.  With this DVD and the ""Cable Mechanism Basics: Tentacles"" DVD, I'm on my way.  You can too!",1432512000,4,949,4.634730538922156
