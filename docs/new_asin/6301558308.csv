346409,4,6301558308,"Streamed this fun and interesting seafaring adventure . Honestly , what's not to like ? James Mason was born to play smart , authoritative leaders . The predictable but erudite rich script and it's dialog provide James ample opportunity to do his thing . Well . If i had to select a leading man of the era (50's) who best exemplified the finest qualities of an Amarican , Alan Ladd would certainly make that short list . Although set in the 1780's/90's , his laconic , integrity exuding confidence has the SHANE appeal this film needs . You'll see some familiar faces and some good sets . Averaging 2 and 1/2 out of 4 stars from a couple of different synoptic film guides (including Leonard's) , you may find yourself being more forgiving of this 1953 semi-gem than the critics . After all , they've got their contemporaries looking over their shoulders and into their books . Quite good ancillary characters as well . Fun .",1340150400,14,924,4.572289156626506

346411,3,6301558308,"Botany Bay is based on a novel by Nordoff and Hall ,the writers  responsible for  that oft filmed tale The Mutiny on the Bounty .The movie in some rspects is a scaled down version of that tale with some of the same ingredients -long sea voyage ,tyrannical captain and exotic locations .What it lacks is the mythical dimension that gives the Bounty movies their extra interest
Alan Ladd plays Hugh Tallant ,a medical student in England,who is unjustly convicted and sentenced to transportation to the new penal colony in New South Wales,Australia. On the voyage he clashes with the sadistic skipper Captain Paul Gilbert(James Mason)both over Gilbert's martinet authoritarianism and disciplinary style but also over a woman ,Sally Munro(Patricia Medina)to whom both are attracted

The voyage to Botany Bay is eventful-floggings and canoodling ,not to mention an outbreak of plague all add to the interest .Nor are things much betetr when they eventually get there as the Aborigines harry the settlement at every opportunity

Ladd and Medina are Okay -nothing more .Cedric Hardwicke is fine as the governor but James Mason takes the acting honours .Mason shot to stardom in the UK in the 1940's playing sadistic types in movies like The Seventh veil and The Wicked Lady and the role here is a reprise of such parts .He did  them very well and he dominates all his scenes

The action is brisk ,the colour is beguiling to the eye and if you want a lean slice of sea going action this will do nicely .It just lacks that little extra to be a minor classic of its kind",1195689600,5,1560,4.780669144981412
346412,2,6301558308,"Based on a novel by the team of Nordhoff and Hall, this dreary film was an obvious attempt to duplicate the success of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, also based on a novel by the same duo.  Since, like its predecessor, it involves a long sea voyage with a sadistic captain, it can't miss, right?  Unfortunately, the resulting film is very dull and is only partly redeemed by good performances, but even James Mason cannot quite save it.",1006646400,8,427,4.532467532467533

346417,3,6301558308,"""Botany Bay"" is a movie of it's time. Made in 1953, it is at it's 65th birthday. Most of us don't wear well after all that time. Neither does Botany Bay.

The setting is legitimate: In the late 1700's many British prisoners were banished to Australia, and many for the petty crimes (stealing a loaf of bread, things like that) that the movie describes. But the circumstances are as artificial as you can get. The hero, Hugh Tallant (Alan Ladd) suffers from a gross miscarriage of justice, gets condemned for it but miraculously is chosen at the last second while imprisoned, for the Next Ship To DownUnder, which he boards, again miraculously just missing news of his pardon and a rather large sum of money (actually, he didn't miss it...he heard about it about a hair too late).

Anyway, off go Ladd and his merry band of malcontents on a projected nine-month trip to Aussie land. On the way he manages to piss off Captain Paul Gilbert (James Mason) to the extent that Ladd gets flogged, keelhauled, and (one imagines) treated to all manner of indignities one might expect to suffer spending nine months as a convict locked inside a bobbing wooden crate crossing the Pacific. However, Ladd and the heroine (gotta have a heroine...) Sally Munro (Patricia Medina) arrive at Botany Bay looking remarkably fit and hale; Ladd with his coiffed hair and clean shirt, and Medina with her buxom assets barely controlled inside her off-the-shoulder blouse. Here they meet the governor of the penal colony, Governor Phillips (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), a nice enough guy (sorta) if a bit confused. Things get tangled from here on out, with the plots, counter plots, and counter-counter plots. Captain Gilbert and Convict Tallant engage in a sort of game of mental chess, ending (finally) when a bushman mercifully skewers Captain Gilbert with a spear, and who dies picturesquely after Tallant (who, it turns out, is a sort of doctor) warns him NOT to pull the spear out of his chest or he will bleed to death, passing on while philosophically ruminating about something or other. And no blood. All's well that ends well, though. Tallant gets it all--and the girl--at the end. Just like most films of that era.

Conclusion: This film was probably great enough in it's day but--this is not it's day. Some movies are timeless and can transcend the time of their making. Silent films such as The General and the German silent classic Metropolis come to mind. But Botany Bay probably didn't stand out all that much even back in '53. It should remain there. Oh, it's probably worth a watch if you like the hokiness of the movie style back then and can sit through the graininess (not offered in HD on Amazon). James Mason is good as the cold, cruel martinet and Sir Cedrick Harwicke lends gravitas to anything he appears in, but Ladd's performance is wooden, and the love interest seems to be stuck in there just for that purpose. It has no real bearing on the story. I watched it with mild enjoyment, but once is enough.",1463443200,,3001,4.734225621414914
346418,3,6301558308,"The acting is a bit dated, but the story is excellent.  Production values could have been better and I wish there had been more shots of the tall ship across the ocean, but all in all, well worth watching.",1463356800,,205,4.256410256410256

346423,4,6301558308,"This is an extremely good film from the 1950s dealing with the eighteenth century British crime-solving solution of voiding the prison population and deporting their cargo to penal colonies in Australia. James Mason is my favorite actor and perhaps the most underrated from among all the greatest actors of the twentieth century. In this thrilling yarn directed by the great John Farrow (father of Mia, and also underrated), Mason is a ruthless, unflinching martinet of a sea captain, who meets out severe punishment for minor infractions, including putting an innocent cabin boy (who later drowns) below decks in chains for suspected theft. This spells trouble for the hero Alan Ladd, who is as charismatic and rebellious as ever, and on the wrong side of the law as one of the ship's many prisoners bound for Botany Bay, New South Wales. Patricia Medina (another prisoner) is an intriguing leading lady who falls in love with Ladd,  but who has to repeatedly ward off Mason's lecherous advances. This would have been a typical sea-going affair under the helm of most directors, but Farrow's production is superb. The cinematography leaves a lot to be desired, but the screenplay more than makes up for this with a fast-paced plot.",1461369600,,1232,5.009756097560976

346449,4,6301558308,"Leonard Maltin gave this movie two and a half stars out of four.  I think James Mason's portrayal of a cultured, well spoken but thoroughly evil ship owner and captain should be enough to get the other half of the star.  Alan Ladd's character is another personification of Shane which is fine with me as I think SHANE is one of the top 100, maybe top 10, westerns.  Ladd and Mason are joined by a strong supporting cast.  The movie could have been improved by shooting on location in Australia.  I noticed that some reviews contain comments such as boring, outdated, tedious, old school, slow, etc.  On the other hand a least one review called the action brisk.  I suppose if your idea of a good seafaring movie is BATTLESHIP, you won't like this one.  Those addicted to near mindless action movies should also look elsewhere.  For the rest of us, the reviewer who called the movie literate has it right.",1452988800,,904,4.565217391304348

346454,3,6301558308,"I liked Alan Ladd in ""SHANE"". He was straight, rigid, and clear on what needed to be done. Well, Mr. Ladd has created another role that embodies the same character in ""Botany Bay"", as a righteously indignant, falsely accused doctor, remanded to servitude in a lost colony down under. The trip there from England is fraught with peril, but the interplay between James Mason, as the evil Captain, the good doctor, and the beautiful Patricia Medina is worth the price of admission. If you liked ""The Mutiny on the Bounty"" with Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, or the Errol Flynn cult classic ""Captain Blood"", you owe it to yourself to give this one a gander.",1446249600,,656,4.71304347826087
