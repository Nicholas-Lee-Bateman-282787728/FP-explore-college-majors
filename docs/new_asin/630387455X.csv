8322934,4,630387455X,"As a longtime E-Type owner, I recommend this video for anyone interested in these fantastic cars. Although the editing is a little confusing (I like to see histories presented chronologically), the viewer does get to see rare factory footage of the prototype car being thrashed around the test track, as well as film (complete with poor sound quality) taken in the 1960s. Overall, I think this video is well worth the money and it has provided additional motivation for me to find another E-type to replace the 1965 coupe I sold two years ago!",971049600,8,543,4.787234042553192
