7928612,1,B00004ZES1,"First: This is not Bruce Lee.  Second: this is just a partial remake of Bruce Lee's ""The Game of Death"".  I say partial because it ends before he enters the tower to continue the fights.",1338940800,,186,4.285714285714286
7928613,4,B00004ZES1,"I saw this as a kid and have been hunting it down for a long time.  It was worth the wait!  As others have mentioned, this movie does NOT contain Bruce Lee or have anything to do with him, other than borrow liberally from his philosophy on Jeet Kune Do.  In fact, the description on the back of the DVD is mostly a lie!  Depending on which version of the film one purchases, the names of the characters are subject to change.

In this one, which is the one pictured, Bruce Li (""Soul Brothers of Kung Fu"") plays Bob, a Chinese immigrant in San Francisco, who gets himself (and his buddy) fired when he teaches a lesson to some dudes who were picking on them.  Much like ""Soul Brothers of Kung Fu"", these goons prevent him from getting a job elsewhere, exerting their influence over any establishment Bob might apply.  He accidentally gains employment on the wharf where the goons attack again.  Bob's buddy prevents him from involvement, so the great Carter Wong (""When Taekwondo Strikes"", ""Big Trouble in Little China"") saves the day, and all the workers dub Bob a coward.  Well, when they inevitably come back with more goons, Bob gives 'em what for and the workers talk him into opening up a dojo.

Though definitely old-school, this is not the ""costume and wig"" flick that most fu fans are familiar with.  It takes place when it was filmed, though I seriously doubt in San Francisco!  The only authentic city footage looks like stock-film from an old Rice-a-Roni commercial.  I had read a review on another site where the person did not recommend it ""... unless you like watching a Bruce Lee clone beat up a seemingly endless wave of untalented white guys""  To which I replied, ""Yes!  Oh, God, yes!""  This movie is as dumb as a bag of hammers, with tons of well choreographed (for the mid-70s) fights (about every 5 minutes), hilarious 70s outfits, great sound effects, and terrible English dubbing.  Simply put: I could watch this all day!  Add to that Korean super-kicker Hwang Jang Lee (""Tiger Over Wall"", ""Shanghai Express"") as the hired baddie for 3 fights and you've got some solid entertainment!  Dude walks around in a white Tae Kwon Do uniform with black fingerless gloves, black shoes, and a cape!  The guy's a time bomb!

The DVD from Saturn Productions has a decent widescreen picture, transferred from and old VHS.  Who cares?  I certainly don't!  Depending on your principles, this one is actually okay for older children.  A little bit of PG-13 language, but no one dies and Bob teaches a few lessons on integrity, righteousness, and mistake admission.  If you love cheesy 70s kung fu this is HIGHLY recommended.  4.5/5 stars in my opinion, though it's insulting to Bruce Lee's memory and fans to have his name and face on the cover.

1976.  aka:  Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu; Bruce Li's Jeet Kune Do; A Dragon Story; Bruce Lee's Secret",1301961600,2,2853,4.648
7928614,4,B00004ZES1,"I agree 100 percent with DARKGENIUS!
I think people are too hard on Bruce Li and his movies.
I've been collecting Kung Fu movies since the 80's.
(I even paid $80 several years ago for an Encyclopedia of Kung Fu movies. Yes, encyclopedia's for this genre do exist!!)
""Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu"" is one of my all-time top
ten favorites!
One of the main reasons I love this film so much is that
the dialogue is so bad, IT'S GOOD! It's classic 70's!
One example, is when the ""San Francisco Kid"" first comes in with the ""traitor"" (same guy who always plays a ""traitor"" in several Bruce Lee films), says, ""Ha, ha, ha! Don't worry. I'll make them sorry they stared this! Ha, ha, ha.""
(I think they made him sound like ""Butthead""(from Beavis & Butthead!)
To me, it's a classic line, and there's nothing else like this genre!

Lastly, I would also like to point out that the fight scenes
are excellent(none of the silly wire-work that's rampant now-a-days)! And the story is not half bad either.",1074038400,2,987,4.5139664804469275
7928615,5,B00004ZES1,"I love this movie, but my praise will have to wait until I make sure a few important facts are established for those out there unfamiliar with Bruceploitation films.  First and foremost, Bruce Lee does not appear in this picture, nor does it have the first thing to do with the real Bruce Lee; the star of the film is Ho Chung Tao (aka Li Shao Lung), better known as Bruce Li.  I wasn't that impressed with Li in the first couple of films I saw, but I have now come to understand why he is regarded by and large as the best of the Bruce Lee clones (and I might point out he never really embraced the concept of being renamed after his idol).  It is unfair to even compare him to Bruce Lee because Li is a pretty darn good martial arts star in his own right.  With this movie, he has won me over completely.  Another important fact about this film concerns the title: these Bruceploitation films of the mid- to late-70s are notorious for having different titles.  This 1976 film is probably best known as Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu, although you may very well see it called Bruce Lee's Secret or Story of the Dragon; additional but less common titles include Bruce Li's Jeet Kune Do, A Dragon Story, and He's a Legend, He's a Hero.  You really have to be careful when buying Bruceploitation films such as this because each movie bears multiple titles.
As for the movie itself, the plot is a very familiar one.  Li plays ""Bob"" Lee, a young Chinese man working in San Francisco; he and his friend are bullied by a trio of thugs, and Bob's decision to teach the guys a little respect for the Chinese lands him and his buddy out of work.  For some reason, the scraggly American guys Bob put a licking on exercise some control over Chinatown, making it very difficult for our hero to find a new job.  When he does get a job working on the docks, the roughnecks show up along with some of their friends to beat everybody there up.  Bob finally has to do his thing again, after which his coworkers convince him to open his own school and teach them kung fu.  If you've seen The Chinese Connection (or just about any other martial arts film), you know this means trouble with the schools already in existence (all of which are, of course, rife with bad guys).  Well, as you can well imagine, the conflict escalates.  Two things make this particular film a little different, though.  For one, Bob is defeated at one point by what I assume was supposed to be some type of Japanese karate expert, forcing him to rethink his strategy and thereby come up with his own personalized form of kung fu.  This provides a window in which a tiny bit of the essence of kung fu is explained to the audience.  Second, in the final conflict, Bob has to deal with an unusual weapon, which makes the predictable climax a little more interesting.
A good many Bruceploitation fans don't seem to care for Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu, but I loved it.  As I said, the plot is pretty similar to that of many a martial arts film, but this story works for me, particularly with the emphasis Bob places on disproving the idea that the Chinese are cowards; everyone who gets in his way is made to respect the Chinese.  Some who know more about kung fu than I do (and I basically know nothing about it) aren't that impressed with the fight scenes featured in the movie, but I thought they were outstanding.  Bruce Li impressed me more here than in any other of his movies I have seen so far.  The action is fast and furious, particularly the one fight between Bob and the Japanese assassin sent to kill him.  The final battle scenes were especially good, as Bob had to single-handedly go through several heavy layers of bad guys in order to reach the man he was really after.
Formulaic it may be, but Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu is one of my favorite Bruceploitation films, and Bruce Li impressed the heck out of me with his fighting skills in this one.  It can be hard for a fan of the real Bruce Lee to embrace the string of Bruceploitation films that were churned out in the years after his death, and many a Lee fan will not watch any of them.  As long as they do nothing to tarnish the image of Lee, however, I can't get enough of them, and Bruce Lee's Deadly Kung Fu is one of the best ones out there.",1066867200,5,4266,4.330402010050252
7928616,3,B00004ZES1,"well, i first ordered this dvd under the impression that it was a documentary of bruce lee's life.  not so,this is an old bruce lei movie.  the cover is bruce lee, the name of the movie is bruce lee, but no bruce lee.  the dvd truly sucks, because there is no menu for it, so in essence it works absolutely no differently than a vhs tape would. no skipping to scenes or anything extra at all.  i did enjoy the movie though, it might have been because i remember watching it on kung fu theater on tv when i was younger. i would recommend getting it used if you truly want to watch it.  the 3 stars are for just enjoyment of the movie, but i would rather have had the documentary any day.",1001980800,5,686,4.08955223880597
7928617,4,B00004ZES1,Ths DVD is just for the Bruce Lee fans. If you like him you should see this film. As a documentary it is cool. But you may not enjoy the picture quality. But for a Bruce Lee fan there is no problem.,973209600,7,198,3.738095238095238
