3945806,1,B002LEZ5TY,This is probably the cheapest film I've seen. It has nothing to do with chicks on chicks. Just not enough kissing or they just didn't have the time to show both girls in bed.,1278720000,4,174,4.147058823529412
3945807,4,B002LEZ5TY,"This is a great movie to watch with your lezzy friends. Some of the characters are crazy, but in a funny way. I love that they're Spanish, Spanish girls are hot!
Yes, your eyes have to get used to reading subtitles, but hey, it's a small price to pay :)
Pro's: funny, quirky, girls are hot
Con's: story lines could be better

If you like 'light reading' you'll enjoy this.",1275696000,6,372,4.314285714285714
3945808,2,B002LEZ5TY,"This was advertised as being like The L Word. I disagree. The story line was boring. Also, reading the subtitles was difficult because the spoken language is so fast.",1263772800,10,166,4.758620689655173
8372555,5,B002LEZ5TY,"This was originally a web series.  It doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you.  This is meant to be comedic, and it is!  I look at it as a Spanish satire of The L Word.
If you don't have any knowledge of Spanish culture, you might miss out on quite a bit.",1480636800,,269,4.037735849056604

8372560,1,B002LEZ5TY,"Didn't care for story line or that it was in Spanish & had to read subtitles. It wasn't what I expected, don't get me wrong some of the women are beautiful but the story it's self sucked big time for me..sorry :(",1369180800,,212,4.071428571428571
8372561,4,B002LEZ5TY,"This is a fairly funny story of a girl who's hooked up with a stalker type, against the advice of her friends and patrons at the bar where she works, and just as she's figuring out that she needs to escape, she meets the stalker's sexy straight roommate and falls for her, who resists every one of the player's moves.  Sexy roommate is battling with her fiance who's not really committed to the relationship, which provides her with some interesting challenges in her work as a counselor--she should know how to handle him in a clinical sense but learns that the professional self just doesn't reconcile with her personal side.  In the meantime, stalker babe decides to take in a new roommate to replace the rent lost when counselor moves in with her rotten fiance, and the one who answers the ad is a ditzy girl who thinks that this exposure to lesbian life will help her as research for her young acting career.  She's not gay but wants to try it out, and of course it is not a good outcome for anyone she tries to involve. In the meantime, player just won't accept that she can't seduce the counselor and, boy, does she try!  Lots of laughs and no real on-screen sex scenes as most lesbian-themed offerings provide, but the player and counselor certainly deliver on the sizzle index.  And I even learned a few pick-up lines on the way!
This is a multi-disc set of around 300 minutes and English subtitle, so set aside several evenings for some laughs, and learn a few new moves for your trouble.  You may be pleased at the results the next time you visit your favorite gathering place...",1360108800,2,1590,4.522648083623693
8372562,4,B002LEZ5TY,"Gorgeous bartender Nines (Celia Freijeiro) is trouble; she charms women as easily as she breathes. When Nines goes home with Monica (Cristina Pons), she chooses the wrong woman. Monica, fondly called ""Monica Psycho"" because of her passive aggressive tendencies, immediately sees herself in a committed relationship with Nines. Nines however, is more interested in Monica's beautiful straight roommate Carmen (Sandra Collantes).

Nines has her hands full as she navigates a tricky relationship with her ex-girlfriend Rosi (Paloma Arimon) and tries repeatedly to break-up with Monica. She uses one ingenious trick after another to charm her way into Carmen's heart and bed with hilarious results. Complicating things further is the arrival of Monica's new roommate Ana (Almudena Gallego) who is naive to the ways of lesbian love and relies on the girls help as she is initiated into life at local lesbian bar Chica Busca Chica.

Director/creators Sonia Sebastian and Olga Iglesias have created a truly unique lesbian soap opera. Chock full of quirky characters, comical situations and witty dialogue, this original web series set in Madrid is fantastic. Shot on a low budget with absolutely no network support or funding, it is astonishing that Sebastian and Iglesias were able to accomplish such a feat.

Spanish TV star Celia Freijeiro is magnetic as serial seducer Nines as she weaves her way through one crazy situation after another. Sandra Collantes is brilliant as ""the hetro"" Carmen dodging Nines advances despite her growing attraction to her.

8372563,4,B002LEZ5TY,"<strong>Girl Seeks Girl</strong> (Sonia Sebastian, 2008)

...on the other hand, <em>Girl Seeks Girl</em>, a feature-length concatenation of clips from a Spanish web series, manages all the coherence, satire, wackiness, unpredictability, and downright fun that's lacking in <em>Sugar Sweet</em> (q.v.), though it is not without its problems. I assume most of those come from the fillmmakers feeling they needed to cut out what seems like it was probably about forty minutes of material for the feature release (if IMDB is to be believed, the entire uncut thing would have run just two hours and ten minutes), but some cannot be so easily explained away. Still, my main problem with it is relatively minor...but I'm getting ahead of myself.

The film revolves around a group of characters, most of whom are either bisexual or lesbian, who move within the circle of Nines (<em>Blue Days</em>' Celia Freijero), a sexually agrressive bartender at a hopping lesbian club. Nines, though, is a protagonist only in spirit; this quickly becomes an ensemble romp as the writers follow whichever story seems the most interesting--the eagerness of new lesbian Ana (<em>Anorexia</em>'s Almudena Gallego) to learn the ropes, which ends up putting someone in the hospital; everyone's terror at their memories of Eva Pino (<em>Piedras</em>' Carla Calparsoro), who loved her way through the entire group before jetting off to some exotic destination or other; dozens of others that weave in and out of the slices of these people's lives. The characters are rich, well-drawn, and fun to be around, and everyone involved was enthusiastic about making this. It comes through in every frame.

The film's biggest problem is that is ends so abruptly (as, presumably, the series did); even another ten minutes spent wrapping up a few old storylines would have been greatly appreciated. But then, by the time you get to that abrrupt ending, you've probably realized that with these folks there is much more of journey than there is of destination anyway; these are not lives that will be easily wrapped-up in American sitcom fashion. They're complex, they're messy, and they're exactly the type of people you'd have a ball hanging around with at the bar. This is immensely enjoyable stuff, and I do wish it had found its way to another season. *** ",1341532800,,2322,5.151193633952254
