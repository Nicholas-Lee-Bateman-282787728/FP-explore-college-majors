7723632,3,B01DSWS1JS,"The received package was intact but the Box Set within it was visibly banged up. This was reported to the Amazon packaging department in detail.
The Ultraviolet Codes for a digital copy are not redeemable in the USA. They are so in the UK. This is stated in frog hair fine print on the box set cardboard box. The discs are marked for Regions A (North America) and B (UK) play. These facts not stated in the product description by Amazon.
Each season has 4 discs which are packaged in an oversized blue plastic clamshell case with a single double pin flap page clamp hinged on the spine. This page holds a disc on each side. This mechanism was broken in each of the 4 seasons cases when received. It may have survived shipping if Amazon had packed the box set rigid in the shipping box.
The quality of the audio/video of the episodes, 3 on each disc, I've viewed thus far is clear and sharp as played on a Vizio BD player.
The options for subtitles are English, English SDH, Danish, Finnish, German, Hindi, Norwegian, Swedish and Turkish.
The options for audio are English 5.1 DTS-HD and German 5.1.

The television series is centered on a manipulative and no holds barred ambitious for power man and his wife an intensely graphic political drama staged with members of The Senate and House of the US government. The lead character is played by Kevin Spacey who addresses the viewers in monlogues that in his delivery bristles one's hair and elicits shivers with goosebumps.
