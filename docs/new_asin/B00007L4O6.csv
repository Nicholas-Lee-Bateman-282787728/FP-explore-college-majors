7977764,5,B00007L4O6,I love this series and it is great to see it so affordable now.,1453766400,,63,3.5714285714285716
7977765,1,B00007L4O6,"Season four of The Lexx is a great disappointment.  The planets Fire and Water, which were very interesting in season 3 have been destroyed, and now the Lexx and crew experience ""the little blue planet"" a ""type 13 planet in its end stages"" meaning Earth.

There are a few laughs, but the shows in season 4, even with the talents of Bunny and Prince are not very well written and in many cases just plain dumb.",1277164800,,409,4.368421052631579
7977766,4,B00007L4O6,"Beginning with a comical account of how the USA's government agencies ""keep the faith"" of the people,(i.e killing off anyone who can be seen as dangerous), Lexx fans are reunited with Prince, the evil ruler of the planet Fire from Season 3.  Now an ATF agent, Prince basically controls the presidency (as well as the entire counrty) and characters from seasons 2 and 3 are once again resurrected (remember Brock from Gametown and Prince's stooge Priest?) to start off the fourth season.  Highly entertaining and incredibly funny, the show picks up right where it left off. In ""Little Blue Planet"" Priest becomes the president of the United States, Lexx eats a South American rain forest, and Prince sends three Russian killers, who are obsessed with fingernails, up to the Lexx.  In ""Texx Lexx"" Kai and Xev get separated on Earth, while Stan underestimates Prince and ends up a prisoner of the ATF.  Xev is so desperate she's willing to have sex with even the grungiest of old men and  Kai runs into a goofy cult.  In ""P4X"" Xev is seuxally exploited by that weird girl from Twilight (Season 2), later is rescued by Kai,  and Prince tries to get the key from Stan with a rather interesting result.  Stan finally escapes in ""Stan Down"" with the help of Priest, who wants the presidency for himself and is sick of his wife's complaining.  His wife (think Love Grows and, I think, Twilight) finds out the hard way that Prince is not to be reckoned with as Prince, Priest, and the first lady all go for a nice ride on famous little street in Dallas.",1046044800,9,1544,4.626373626373627
7977767,1,B00007L4O6,"In series 4, the writers of LEXX ill-advisedly abandoned their early commitment to avoiding earth, with REALLY boring results.  From the stunning and artistic special effects of the first series to the pedestrian world of TV sitcoms, dufuss politicians, and landscapes at best like Lodi on a bad day, is a long way to plunge.  The only good thing to be said is that they at least blow everything up at the end.  Series 1 is stupendous, and series 2 and 3 are excellent.  Avoid series 4.",1045872000,10,486,4.551724137931035
