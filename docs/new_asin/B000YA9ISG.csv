8231605,5,B000YA9ISG,"This show continues to crack me up.  Some episodes are funnier than others, but overall it's the funniest show on television.  I've watched some episodes countless times, and even though I know what's going to happen, I still find myself cracking up beyond belief.  If you've never seen it before, it's the type of show you do not want to miss.  Please be advised it is full of adult content and may not be suitable for anyone under 17.",1398297600,,436,4.481012658227848
8231606,5,B000YA9ISG,"Kenny Hotz is mean spirited, evil, a genius, and lastly hilarious. He is also Spencer Nolan Rices master and sexual infatuation. Kenny goes to any length to beat and or humiliate his putz of a roommate.

This show is good for some serious belly laughs and sometimes some really gaggable moments. But it is good adult humor.

Spenny you are an idiot.",1200873600,,349,4.612903225806452
8231607,5,B000YA9ISG,"This is the season that gave a new definition to crazy.  I cannot believe that Spenny doesn't just walk away with the destruction that Kenny causes in his life, especially in this season.  From being dosed with LSD and crapping all over himself, to having a cup of semen thrown in his face, Spenny was just tortured in this season.  And I laughed every bit of the way!",1200441600,3,368,4.382352941176471
8231608,5,B000YA9ISG,"They out did themselves again.  Brutally hilarious.  What is so compelling about this show is that it really is difficult to watch at certain thymes (sic).  I somethymes (sic) really wonder if it's legit or Spenny is hamming up his retardity (that isn't a word).  Kenny is really getting into his own and I do find his angst more nuanced and hilarious from the previous seasons.  Spenny is Spenny. I love it when he wins but somethymes (sic) I just can't root for him.  The DVD is great...  The commentary by Sebastian and Donny should've been done for the ""Who Can Imitate Other Guy Better"" as opposed to the ""Who Can Make A Better Porno""...  Even though it is hilarious.  The other commentaries seem to be better than previous seasons. Kenny has been trying to actually ""comment"" on the episodes as opposed to ranking on Spenny even more.  But still, I would like to see (hear) more commentaries on the episodes, preferrably all.  The 3rd season on DVD gets the highest rating possible... Very funny show.",1197936000,3,1007,4.6647727272727275
