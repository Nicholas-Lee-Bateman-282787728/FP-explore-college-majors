4382327,2,B004I2K4E8,"I tought it would be a great show, but to my surprise, I found out that the performance was rather poor in comparison to the previous live presentation (The dream cast in concert) in 1998.",1297728000,13,188,4.4
4382328,5,B004I2K4E8,"Les Misrables has been around for a long time, pleasing audiences around the world - its songs are recorded by an vast array of singers and its impact on audiences is justifiably powerful.  Though this filming of the concert production of the musical as performed at London's O2 Arena in January 2010 is hailed as the 25th anniversary of the musical, it is too frequently forgotten that the show, based on the Victor Hugo novel,  was originally written by  Claude-Michel Schnberg and Alain Boubil with  Jean-Marc Natel and produced in Paris, France in 1980 (it closed after 3 months).  This English Adaptation is by Trevor Nunn and John Caird (with additional material by James Fenton) was brought to England and the world through the efforts of Cameron MacKintosh in 1985.

The concert version is performed with orchestra and chorus in the top of the platforms in O2 Arena and the characters in the musical are in costume standing before microphones at the edge of the performing structure. The light crew performs spectacular effects with the enormous facilities at this 23,000 seat arena. Some action is projected on screens above the performers (the lifting of the cart by Valjean, the barricade, etc) and at other times the screens offer the audience huge close-up view of the performers. It works well under the direction of Nick Morris. The celebration of the birthday of the show is accompanied by prolonged appearances by past members of casts of the show, a light show, and much confetti and self congratulation speeches.

As for the production itself it is populate by a generally strong cast.  Alfie Boe, a 37 year old British tenor who studied opera but now sings the big demanding musicals, is a very fine Jean Valjean. Norm Lewis, and American actor/baritone is one of the strongest Jauverts on record: he is a talent to watch. Lea Salonga brings years of experience to her interpretation of Fantine, Samantha Banks is a very strong Eponine, the Iranian-born Canadian musical theater singing actor Ramin Karimloo makes a striking impression in the role of Enjolras (he has been playing the role of Phantom in the 'Phantom of the Opera' in England for years), but the performance of Katie Hall as Cosette sounds strained, the Monsieur Thnardier of Matt Lucas is completely unfocused (Jenny Galloway fares better as Madame Thnardier), and it is obvious the producers elected to play to the young audience by miscasting pop star Nick Jonas as Marius: he tries very hard but is out of his league here.

In all, this is an entertaining memento of a birthday celebration - heavy on audience screaming and special party effects - and rewards the creators of this lasting fine musical with due respect.  Grady Harp, February 11",1296950400,38,2734,4.911062906724512
4382329,5,B004I2K4E8,"This new concert version raised the stakes from the 10th Anniversary concert.  The difference on this one is that it's semi-staged.  Actors come on and off stage, so they are not just sitting there.  It adds to the excitement of the concert.  This version also contains the changes made for the 25th Anniversary production.  Slight orchestration changes and libretto changes as well as constumes and set changes (including the Victor Hugo paintings).  The performances are all strong and fantastic except for Nick Jonas.  He lacks the strong passionate voice that makes the character of Marius.

The filming and sound of this production is fantastic.  The 1080p really makes this a brilliantly visual concert film.  I highly recommend picking this BluRay disc up!  FYI: it was commented that this was a cheaper disc when purchased through amazon.co.uk.  This is true.  With shipping the price is about $21 as opposed to the $56 price tag on the import or the $28 price on the forthcoming US release.  Be advised, it will take about 3 weeks to receive...but it's worth it!",1295481600,3,1071,4.943820224719101
4382330,5,B004I2K4E8,"Wow!  What an outstanding concert presentation of this opera-like musical adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel ""Les Miserables"", which has been a worldwide sensation for over 25 years. This 25th anniversary concert, taped on October 3, 2010 before a wildly enthusiastic audience of several thousand at the cavernous O2 Arena in London, was simply superb--the production values (state-of-the-art lighting, audio, and video), the fantastic talent assembled on the stage, including performers from several companies--all in costume--and a huge back-up chorus all contributed to an amazing performance.

Notable among the cast were Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, Lea Salonga as Fantine, Katie Hall as Cosette, and Norm Lewis as Javert. Much unfair criticism has been heaped upon pop singer Nick Jonas, who plays the part of Marius, the young student who falls in love with, and eventually marries, Cosette. While his voice is not operatic (while the other cast members have such voices), his voice is nonetheless fairly good and with his boyish good looks, he is very convincing as the young idealistic student who becomes the love interest of Cosette.

The grand finale alone is the worth the price of the BD:  members of the original cast (and other previous and current cast members) sing duets and medleys, including four different Valjeans, all incredibly awesome. Their performance of ""Bring Him Home"" will bring tears to your eyes.

The Blu-ray Disc's video and audio are both excellent--you will not be disappointed in the sharp, pristine video and the impressive, full audio. If you have a surround-sound system, you are in for a real treat.

Also, this BD, which I ordered from Amazon.uk, is region-free:  It will play flawlessly on Region A (U.S. & Canada) Blu-ray players. I live in Allentown, Pennsylvania, USA--and this BD, which is not yet available on Amazon in the U.S., was a bargain, less than $23-US, including shipping.

This BD is a keeper--you will watch it over and over again.  Highly recommended!",1295481600,351,2013,5.1692307692307695
4382331,5,B004I2K4E8,"This show is stupendous and all of it (nearly 3 hours) is on this Blu-ray edition made to mark the 25th anniversary of its original opening. My wife and I loved the whole thing and, short of seeing it live, this recorded version must be the best ever to watch. Lots of people have praised it to the heights and all of the praise is deserved and need not be repeated by me. I just think that it's worth noting that the 02 arena adds a very special something to the atmosphere and, obviously, to the numbers of people who could be there, live, for the recording. In the context of the 02 - formerly known as the Millennium Dome - thanks might also be offered to the principal politicians who saw that project through: Michael Heseltine and Peter Mandelson. Without those earlier supporters, the genius of Sir Cameron Mackintosh's 02 production would never have been seen or known.

Oh, and thank you, too, to Victor Hugo. Gone, but as long as 'Les Miserables' lives, not forgotten",1294617600,6,978,4.52542372881356
4382332,2,B004I2K4E8,"It should have been an amazing show.
Everything was going exceptionally well and everyone was giving amazing performances.

Untill..... Nick Jonas arrives at the stage.

Who in their right mind casts Nick Jonas for such a show? This was a DISGRACE.
I even felt sorry for the guy, trying to sing along with his amazing talented colleagues.

I was so disapointed with his performance I did not even had the stomach to finish the Blu-Ray.

I can't give more than a 2 Star rating because of this and I am sorry to say I will never recommend this to anyone.

Buy the 10 Year aniversary DVD instead. That one is worth it.

Don't buy this one. I'm sorry I did.",1294531200,11,653,4.4
4382333,5,B004I2K4E8,"Every performance (save one) was impeccable. Many of the performers rival and in some cases surpass those of the 10th Anniversary Dreamcast. Seeing the show on the big screen with a bigger sound system really made the nuances of the genius score come to life. I am thrilled that it is finally on DVD! The use of soft split screens to be able to watch multiple performers' reactions and ""dialog"" was a wise creative decision.

The stunning Norm Lewis, whose subtle facial expressions and genuine passion commanded the stage/screen, sang Javert with such power and depth that I actually, for the first time, empathized with his character. Alife Boe's Val Jean was brilliant, with an operatic quality. Samantha Barks shined as Eponine with a stunning vocal performance. Besides being delicious eye-candy, Ramin Karimloo was a standout with his brilliant portrayal of Enjolras. I didn't quite understand the decision of casting Nick Jonas as Marius. He really gave it his all and had some nice moments in the sweeter songs, but lacked the vocal fullness and attack for the more powerful songs. It was adequate but uncomfortably contrasted by his much stronger, seasoned cast mates.

The occasional cut to various instrumental highlights was a wonderful addition and seamlessly included the orchestra as an important part of the ensemble. The encores with the original cast, backed by a chorus of hundreds was breathtaking (particularly when Michael Ball reprised Marius in ""One Day More"" the way it should be sung. If you're a Les Mis fan, this movie is a must.",1293580800,23,1557,5.0310077519379846

4382335,4,B004I2K4E8,"The NOTLD 25th Anniversary documentary was a great pleasure to watch. The sound studio scene with Karl Hardman & Marilyn Eastman was fascinatingly revealing, as were the photographs of the made-up zombies.  The meeting between Hardman, Romero, Russo and Streiner could have been a  little more sharp, though, as it is now a mere friendly chat between old  pals.

I also own a DVD of the 10th Anniversary Concert.  The quality of the singing is the same.

His rendition of Bring Him Home brought the house down and left me balling. My favorite was Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras. All I can say about his performance is ""WOW!""

A lot of people are down on Nick Jonas as Marius, but I liked him. His performance definitely had some things lacking beside the incredible stage actors, but he had such a sweet earnestness about him that perfectly captured the Marius of the novel. In the book, Marius was a dead serious and naive young man. Nick Jonas looked like he wasn't even trying to be that way! And he sure put his heart into it, especially on ""Empty Chairs"".

The woman who played Fantine was a bit too polished to express the anguish and despair of the character. I liked the actress who played Cosette. She seemed to portray the blend of coquettishness and naivete of the character.

Can you kill the dead? They must stay in the farmhouse until help arrives. [No telephone service?]

Night falls. They have electricity. The radio has ""trash talk"", people who talk as if they know something when they don't. Ben and Barbara take out the trash, then talk about what happened. Only a shot to the head will stop them. Ben finds ammunition, there must be guns in the house. Ben finds one (the previous owner has no need for it). They find other refugees in the house. The truck is out of gas, is there gas kept in the shed? Should they hide in the cellar? Ben says no. They learn what happened earlier. There are personal conflicts. Ben orders boards nailed over the glass windows for protection. Barbara sees more zombies approaching the house. The activities provide shocking surprises! The television tells of an emergency. Will Cooper cooperate? Can they work together? A zombie tries to break in, but is stopped. Barbara shows her marksmanship skills! She gets more bullets. Cooper hears the TV broadcast news.

What is causing people to act like that? What if the recently dead should come back to life? Is it a widespread virus? Judgment Day? There is more personal conflict inside. Can they find the truck keys? Yes, but they need gas for the truck. More zombies gather around the house, a flaming torch keeps them away. The gas pump explodes and the truck burns. No escape now. Ben fights his way back. Cooper fights with Barbara for the rifle! What happened to Sarah? Can Barbara get help? Zombies break on through to the inside! Is there no escape? What will happen when they run out of bullets? The morning brings help, armed men and a helicopter. The zombies are disposed of, then place on a huge pile. They find one in the cellar. Barbara gets the last one! She watches the burning pyre. What is she thinking now?

The original 1968 monochrome movie was a low budget production from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania that was a surprise hit in the spring of that year. It resonated with the audience somehow. This is a copy that has some changes from the original story. Was it better? The original was more restrained, perhaps due to the censorship of that era. The story didn't offer an explanation for its impossible premise. What happened in the other parts of the country, such as urban areas? Will they ever offer a third version? Not if there is no paying audience. Does this uprising symbolize the threat from the huge debts of the past? They can't be ended with a well-aimed rifle shot. You may like this movie more if you never saw the original, which was also average.",1482278400,,3349,4.642495784148398

Alfie Boe was the best Jean Valjean ever, and that is a bold statement considering who was on the stage after the performance.  The only weak link in the cast was Nick Jonas, who appeared to be a boy among men singers.  Ramin Karimloo would have stolen the show except for Alfie Boe.  Karim was his usual magnificent self.

Samantha Barks is stunning in her performance, and one can see how she earned her way to the ""big screen"" film that followed.

There were two scenes that may be problematic for younger kids - both around the topic of prostitution. One scene was not needed to further the story and was more explicit than I would like to have exposed my 11 yo. The violence was inline with what I've seen in other movies. It was upsetting to see a young boy shot but that is part of the story. Otherwise, we really enjoyed the movie.

Three of my six times to see Les Mis, I had the joy of hearing Colm Wilkenson.  Legendary performance.  However, having just discovered Alfi Boe, I was blown away.  His range, expressions (thank you blueray), etc, made me feel I was one with the lead star.  Norm Lewis was stunning as Javert.  Lea Salonga's performance was moving and perfect.  Katie Hall as Cossette was good, but I have seen better.  The standout to me was Samantha Barks.  She had me in tears.  The music was as good as I have EVER heard as was the extra 500 choir members.  The entire production was stunning.  Especially the end where they bring out the original cast and others to sing with the current cast.  The main downside to the show was Nick Jonas.  I'm sure they thought they needed some star power, but his voice is just NOT right for the part.  Very weak, short notes and stunted acting (even for just this concert).  I cringed knowing a high note was coming.  He wasn't terrible, but just was not necessary to the show.  I felt redeemed with Michael Ball returned to sing a Marius Song.  Les Mis ALWAYS brings me to tears (noticed Alfie shed a few tears), but this performance had me in overtime tears.  Buy it now...",1458172800,10,1361,4.407258064516129

Note: The Les Mis 2010 Cats recording album offers a DIFFERENT cast than who are portrayed in this recording at the O2 theater.

4382512,4,B004I2K4E8,"Great performance and also a bit different compared to a canonical stage theatre performance. As the title clearly states, this is ""Les Miserables"" in concert. Therefore, expect singers in front of microphones singing their pieces. It is not like other state performances: e.g. The phantom of the Opera where actors need to act and sing actively all the time. The cast is great and some characters are very expressive. I loved Javert and his fantastic  tone.

Nick was only 17 years old when this was performed so give some credit because the last time he was in Les Miz was when he was Gavroche on Broadway when he was about 7. So instead of hating on Nick Jonas, just enjoy the performance and enjoy the music. He was amazing and so was the rest of the cast.",1445385600,,448,4.160919540229885

When so many excellent choices for Marius seem to abound, and while his performance was surprisingly good, he is so out of his league among these great performers that his admittedly and surprisingly good performance is sophomoric and laughable.  Don't get me wrong, I totally understand what the impetus was for his casting, but honestly there were no favors done for him by placing him next to these world-class performers.  He could only pale in comparison.",1442620800,,527,5.238095238095238

4382549,5,B004I2K4E8,"Phenomenal production of this moving story, one of my top ten favorite books.  Early reviewers panned the musical in 1985, saying it was a lurid Victorian soap opera. Well, audiences loved it and still do. I was disappointed with the 2012 movie of Les Mis, mostly because of the camera angles almost down the singers' throats, so this is a healing antidote. All the singers are great, but Alfie Boe blows me away.
This is a concert with the characters in costume, but with no acting. Hundreds of singers join the principles in this outstanding production, with hundreds of students under 19 joining in at the end--also moving. I can only think how wonderful it must have been to be part of the production.
The grand finale with previous Jean Valjeans singing Bring Him Home is touching, making many in the audience cry, as did Jean Valjean's dying.
I rented this version first, but after watching it twice, I decided to buy it.",1440633600,3,927,4.6871165644171775

The ""in Concert"" versions singing voices ar e beyaond comparison, and the finaly left no dry eye!  A masterpiece indeed.  Don't miss it.",1428969600,,431,4.77027027027027

4382623,5,B004I2K4E8,"I have seen this musical several times on Broadway, the original, the two revivals, including the recent production, which, by the way, was just plain awful, melodramatic, and misguided.  This Alfie Boe concert version is the best.  Even though it is on DVD, it seems like you are there.  The singing, acting, and orchestra are above average.  This concert version is not only better than the current live, NY production, but you experience the story even more deeply.  It seems like the characters walking on the stage in character, singing directly into the mic and then having the cameras showing their faces on split screens is just as magical as seeing it live.  This is hard for me to admit as I am an avid Broadway musical viewer, having seen all the hit plays and musicals on Broadway since 1985.  Bravo to this London cast.",1427328000,,832,4.696551724137931

I was able to be in a production of Les Miserables recently with 3 of my daughters, one of which was 6 and starred as young cosette. What an experience. If you haven't see this production you are missing out. By far the best one out there. I'm not a huge fan of the theatrical versions. At the end of this since it is the 25th anniversary they bring back all the main leads from all the previous productions. My absolute favorite that moves me to tears every time is when all the characters who play Val Jean sing together, ""Bring Him Home"". Wow!!!! I can't say enough. If there is one musical you are going to watch let it be this one, such an amazing story of redemption and love.

I have to say I am disappointed that they made changes from the original production. Why change something already perfect?

The main characters did not move me in this production as did all the past performances I have seen. Their singing voices of course with the exception of Nick Jonas who was not meant for this role were great, yet lacked emotion, at least for me. Lea Salonga even seemed to over sing her role as Fantine. She was in the Dream Cast as  ponine and was much better in that role.

Try to catch the Dream Cast in the 10th Anniversary with Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean,and Philip Quast as Inspector Javert,",1420156800,,784,4.546099290780142

The following is a summary of some of the major cast members: Alfie Boe makes a wonderful Jean Valjean with great control over his voice and effortless expression throughout.  He has a wonderful interpretation throughout that is on par with Colm Wilkinson's creation of the character.  Norm Lewis may be the best Javert I've ever heard.  Unlike Philip Quast (10th Anniversary) who is also wonderful, Norm treats more of the character's music as songs rather than sung-spoke text.  His voices depth and power really give Javert the presence needed throughout and his interpretation of Javert's death scene is the best I've ever heard or scene, live or recorded.

Lea Salonga reprises her role as Fantine (which she performed towards the end of the run on Broadway).  Her version of Fantine is the most heartfelt and sad I've ever heard the role.  After reading the novel (English translation) you can see how much Lea understands the character and what the text she sings actually means to the character.  Ramin Karimloo plays a great Enjorlas, with power and poise throughout.  Newcommer Samantha Barks turns out a great rendition of Eponine.  Her version of ""On My Own"" rivals that of Lea Salonga's on the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast.  Both have different approaches but get to the same point just as well.  The only casting mistake was Nick Jonas as Marius.  Yes he did play Marius on Broadway and he really isn't an awful singer either.  The problem is that compared to the vocal talent on the stage for the 25th Anniversary Concert, Nick Jonas sounds immature and lacking in refinement as a singer.  His performance is lacking in emotion and character throughout and it seems as if he is working much harder than anyone else just to sing the parts.

Overall, the whole concert is fantastic and a must for any Les Miz or musical fan to see.

NOTE: The newest Les Miz CD ""Live!"" Dream the Dream is NOT this cast, but from one of the London productions (I believe at the Queen's Theatre) running at the same time as the concert took place.  Hopefully they will one day release this cast on CD.",1412208000,,2266,4.746803069053708

I can see why commercially Nick Jonas is used as Marius, and he isn't terrible, but I will always be accustomed to a Michael Ball type voice in that part. The choir adds a great depth of sound and the ensemble is strong.

If you're a Les Miserables diehard and only wish to watch the 10th anniversary original London cast, the only thing that will disappoint you in this version is the publicity stunt of casting Nick Jonas as Marius.

The play brought me to tears several times during its course, especially when Alfie sang ""Bring Him Home"".  Matt Lucas was hilarious as DeNardier, the innkeeper, as was the lady who played his wife(Jenny Galloway?)--her facial expressions were priceless!  The young fellow, Nick Jonas, who played Marius,  though only a teen, has good vocal projection that can only improve as he matures--I must admit my favorite Marius is Michael Ball, but Nick may step up to his level eventually.  Norm Lewis also has a beautiful voice, which I enjoyed very much despite his being a ""bad guy"".  Congratulations to all the 'behind the scene' people who made this play so very enjoyable.

4382781,5,B004I2K4E8,"I just finished watching this for the gazillionth time and it's definitely the video to buy.  For a concert staging, the staging is very effective - not always the case - and makes for a moving presentation of the show.

There are some real standout performances, starting with Norm Lewis as Javert.  He's brilliant.  His rendition of Stars is enough to make me forget anybody's else's.  He really should have been the person cast in the movie, and it's a crying shame he wasn't.

Samantha Banks is the only Eponine I've ever been able to listen to without bleeding from the ears.  She not only finds a beautiful vocal sound for the role, but she also delivers a fine acting performance that is moving and really makes you care for her character.

Lea Salonga has a powerhouse voice as Fantine and also delivers a beautiful and touching performance.  And Ramin Karimloo is not only one of the prettiest people on the stage, but has a big, gorgeous voice that makes Enjolras someone you can't take your eyes - or your ears - off of.

Alfie Boe is not the best Jean Valjean I've ever heard - that honor goes to Gary Morris in the Complete Symphonic Recording (which has FINALLY been released digitally) - but he does a beautiful job here.  He has another big strapping voice, but can also pull it down beautifully for the quieter, more intimate moments without losing any of the core of the sound.  So he's right up there at the top of the list for me.

And really, Nick Jonas isn't bad.  There have certainly been better Mariuses, but there have been worse, too.  There isn't much depth there, either vocally or interpretively, but there's also not much that's objectionable.  (Could be worse - could be Helena Bonham Carter or Russell Crowe trying to sing, and he was nowhere near that bad.  With them as the definition of bad, he was actually darn good.)  The ensemble is also very good - they have a great sound, and sing with real vigor and a sense of being intrinsic to the show, which they are.  And the Thenardiers are appropriately disgusting.

The fun in this video comes at the end, when members of the original London cast and more recent casts join this group on stage to sing through Bring Him Home and Do You Hear the People Sing?  Hearing four different Valjeans, with four different voices, including Colm Wilkinson, who no longer has the power he once had, but still has some real beauty to his sound, sing Bring Him Home together is a real treat, and Do You Hear the People Sing?, with all those big voices going at once, is electrifying.

If you don't have this version, just buy it now and watch it right away.  If you don't, you're really missing something great.",1403568000,,2683,4.532224532224532

The latest musical version (2012) was a huge departure from the book, and was a tremendous disappointment to me.  Since all the songs were recorded at the time of filming and not in a studio, there are a number of very noticeable flats and sharps, as well as being very unpleasant to the ear.

Interestingly, Lea Salonga who is magnificent as Eponime in the 10th anniversary, is just okay as Fauntine in the 25th.  The two Jean Valjean (Colm Wilkinson in 10th, and Alfie Boe in 25th) are both very good.  Boe has a prettier voice.  I think Wilkinson styles the songs a bit better.

I was strolling through channels and nothing was on so I stopped looking and just left it on PBS, and then... WHAM!

Alfie Boe is Exceptional.  I was highly impressed with all of the cast... until little Nick Jonas showed up.  SERIOUSLY?  I hate to say but I was sadly dissapointed with his performance.  I think he has some potential, and with more training and conditioning he could go somewhere in the theatre world, but I actually find myself fast-forwarding through his segments.... Empty Chairs is probably my favorite song of the whole play, and he butchers it.  Plain and simple.

4382807,5,B004I2K4E8,I was so excited when I heard that this was coming out and couldn't wait to see the cast.  The new Jean Valjean is incredible...WOW.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection for Marius (Nick Jonas).  He may be popular but he is not a Broadway type singer.  He can't hold the notes like the others.  Even so...I loved it!!!,1395964800,,324,4.245901639344262

I couldn't believe it when I first found out she was gonna reprise role in the movie version. She was amazing. They all were. :) I agree that if they re-released the 10th anniversary celebration of this show on dvd in 2012 which was first released in 2008, I think they can release the 10th anniversary on blurayHD as well. One of my favorite songs in this musical is ""Stars"". I've performed it myself. lol :) Seriously. Anyway, this review is for the 25th anniversary edition on bluray of this show. Those who have not bought this item, please, do so. I HIGHLY recommend it. I promise you all will NOT be disappointed. If you're a true fan, this bluray is for you.

I  have seen Les Miz 3 times but until I saw/listened to this DVD I didn't appreciate it at all.  The singing is superb as it should be with these artists.  My daughter gave me a running commentary the first time we watched it but your DVD won't come with that :).  I am hooked.  My uncle is an opera fan so I bought one for him too.,1393632000,,434,3.9310344827586206

4382837,5,B004I2K4E8,I've watched this DVD over and over again.  It is well produced and the music is fantastic.  Samantha Barks steals the show.  This is why she will be a STAR!  Katie Hall is also exceptional.,1391126400,,190,4.3428571428571425
4382838,5,B004I2K4E8,"We are huge fans of the 10th Anniversary Concert with Colm Wilkinson, but Alfie Boe stole our hearts in this 25th Anniversary Concert.  Unfortunately, Nick Jonas painfully stands out among this great cast.  His portrayal of Marius is wooden and blah.  No idea why they chose him for the part of Marius.  Katie Hall, with her lovely voice, fits the part of Cosette.  Samantha Barks is a wonderful Eponine and Norm Lewis as Javert . . . wow!  Never thought there could be others as good as Lea Selonga and Phillip Quast, but Barks and Lewis are fantastic.  If you enjoyed the 10th anniversary concert, don't hesitate to purchase this fine performance of the 25th anniversary.  Wish they would release a CD of the 25th Anniversary with this cast!",1390867200,,743,4.705426356589148

4382842,1,B004I2K4E8,The dvd was flawed and would stop running about mid way through.  It would just freeze up. By skipping about 5 minutes of the show it would start working again.  Ruined the performance.,1390003200,,185,4.575757575757576
4382843,5,B004I2K4E8,"Previous reviewers were correct. This is even better than the 10th anniversary DVD. It's a must for anyone who loves Les Miserables as I do. I wore out my VHS of the 10th concert because I played it so often. However, the 25th anniversary concert has the advantage of better sound and visual technology. It'll raise the hair on the back of your neck and bring you to joyful tears!

Just not sure how Nick Jonas was cast as Marius? He lacks the voice and stage presence of the other artists. A minor glitch in an otherwise perfect show.",1389916800,,535,4.404040404040404

We opened it yesterday and tried to play it. It ""could not be read"".
I should rate it a ""0"" but didn't know  how. Can't play it at all and don't know what to do. It also did not have the insert listing scenes,etc.

4382847,5,B004I2K4E8,"Love this DVD. Saw Les Mis in London 25 years ago and didn't understand it at all but when the movie was coming out, I decided to get this DVD (and the 10th Anniversary DVD) to get some idea about the story. The movie filled in some info that wasn't explained on the DVD but this DVD is so much better, especially the singing.  Even though it's a 'staging' of the play, it seems like a play to me. The set, the costumes and the choir are fantastic. I enjoy this version better than the 10th version as it is more elaborate and the original cast members come out at the end and sign their signature songs. I am addicted to this DVD. It will change you from thinking 'Les Miserable' to 'Les Miserables'.",1389312000,,701,4.231343283582089
4382848,5,B004I2K4E8,I bought this dvd after I thought I misplaced my 10th anniversary dvd of Les MIs.  Again I fell in love with the new cast and the music.  Alfie Boe  has a strong tender tenor voice that one can listen to for days.  Les Mis is my go to dvd when I am alone and have and want to listen to beautiful story with beautiful music.,1389312000,,323,3.8484848484848486

4382858,5,B004I2K4E8,"I bought this DVD after seeing it on TV and DVRing it... I have it in my computer constantly, it's on my phone, and I never cease to listen to the AWESOME vocals of sensation tenor Alfie Boe.... While it is a concert, you can see the expressions on his face as the brings the songs to life... And ""Bring Him Home"" became his signature song following this concert,.
Samantha Barks shines as Eponine ~ what a voice... No wonder SHE made it to the movie (Boe should have too!!!)
Not liking Norm Lewis as Jarvert, but not to bad.
The one glaring mistake was casting Nick Jonas as Marius... He never got over his ""Boy Band"" brand of singing and just could not pull off the emotions of Empty Chairs At Empty Tables (Marius Signature Song).
Otherwise, I shall buy it again when I wear this one out... I highly recommend it, if for nothing but Boe... And at the end The Four Val Jeans....Pure genious!!!  If you love Les Mis as much as I do, it's well worth buying (after all I bought the DVD AND for my phone)........ ENJOY",1388620800,,1016,4.291666666666667
4382859,5,B004I2K4E8,"Just as the book is often better than the movie, so the minimalist theatrical presentation of Les Mis deepens the emotional involvement with the story as compared with the movie. And this presentation ranks among the best of its genre.",1388448000,,235,4.9

4382862,5,B004I2K4E8,My introduction to the incredibly talented Alfie Boe began when I saw the 25th Anniversary Concert in a movie theatre setting.  His perfectly nuanced performance is worth the price alone... and then there's the rest of the cast of this favorite show.  You must own a copy for yourself.

4382867,5,B004I2K4E8,"I caught this version on ""On Demand"" without fundraising ads, etc.  Wow!  Didn't think I'd like anyone other than Colm Wilkinson in the lead role.  As the product description states, ""comparing the 1995 concert and the 2010, the newer one has superior audio and video, but the earlier one has the stronger cast top to bottom.""  The 2010 version also includes many scenes omitted from the 1995 version (but included in the 2012 movie).  The 4 Valeans singing ""Bring Him Home"" brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.  So, while the 1995 version will stay in my car as my favorite audio version, this 25th Anniversary version is now my favorite visual and ""complete play"" version.  (Previously, I favored the 2012 movie for its more complete story telling and photography, but compared to the 25th Anniversary version, the singing is horrendous.  Even Nick Jonas is tolerable, although he looks nauseous most of the time.)

Like the 25th Anniversary ""Phantom of the Opera,"" this CD does not come with ANY literature.  I had to Google to find more information about the cast and production.  I wish a brochure with information had been included.",1387152000,,1148,4.835897435897436

4382869,5,B004I2K4E8,This is FABULOUS! I have watched this about 50 times already. I have also seen it on Broadway. These are cream of the crop performers. I don't know why they bothered making the movie without these performers.,1386979200,,208,4.648648648648648

In fact, I had watched this concert version several times with friends and was in London a few weeks later and, to fill in an evening, went to a performance and found I actually preferred the music in this concert version. The story line is quite close to the play and the fact that the singers are doing just that -- singing -- rather than also carrying a full stage production means they remain totally focused on the music.

I am usually a fan of Lea Salonga but either she was tired or getting over an illness becuase her voice was not on level weith her usual wonderful singing. Truly, I was nearly appalled at Nick Jonas's poor portryal of Marius. Katie Hall completely drowns him out because of his weak vocal performance. I have nothing aganist Nick Jonas personally but he can't sing rock opera obviously.

4382913,5,B004I2K4E8,"The 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables causes tempers to flare and spirits to sore. Some people hate this version, others love it. Many times, the opinion simply depends on what edition of Les Miserables one is used to. I must say that I find the 25th Anniversary Concert to be one of the best renditions of Les Miserables to be found. Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are stunning in the roles of Jean Valjean and Javert. Their voices are powerful, huge, and fit the score magnificently. While the concert is certainly not perfect, it is still an incredible production and well-worth watching.

Naturally this question will arise; is it better than the 10th anniversary?

Since comparisons are constantly made between the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts, I'm going to get this out of the way immediately. There is ne definite answer to this question; it is entirely a matter of taste or what one is used to. Even if one loves the 10th anniversary, however, there is absolutely no reason not to immerse oneself in another high quality production of Les Miserables.

Now that that is out of the way...

One of the most remarkable aspects of this production is Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean and Norm Lewis as Javert. Boe is an opera singer, and is spectacular in the role. His vocals are particular noticeable during Valjean's soliloquies in Act One, where he reaches very high notes while retaining vocal depth. However, it is not simply Boe's singing voice that makes him perfect for the part. His eyes radiate kindness and warmth and he is a absolute pleasure to watch. Norm Lewis, as Javert, also has an incredibly powerful voice. His Javert has an attitude of power, and his rendition of ""Stars"" is one of the best ever. They both are easily five-stars.

Needless to say, Les Miserables is full of other famous characters, most of them being admirably played here. For anyone with an interest in musical theatre, there are a number of recognizable faces here. Lea Salonga, who played ponine in the 10th anniversary, appears in this production as Fantine. Jenny Galloway once again plays Madame Thnardier, (she appeared in the same role in the 10th anniversary). Also in the cast is Ramin Karimloo (perhaps best known for The Phantom of the Opera) as Enjolras, Nick Jonas as Marius and Samantha Barks as ponine

Most of the supporting cast is incredibly good. Their energy is high and their voices powerful. It is with Nick Jonas that there is the most serious problem. Jonas' voice lacks power, often sounding nasally; he is undoubtedly the worst of the cast. Despite this, the cast is quite good overall.

While different from the 10th anniversary, the 25th is a worthy version of Les Miserables. I highly recommend it!",1380240000,,2722,4.803418803418803

All I could think while watching this is how painful it must have been for the rest of the cast to have him cast a Marius.  I guess it was done with the idea of appealing to teenage girls and getting them to urge their parents to buy tickets to the show.  He was definately the weak link in this production.

Alfie Boe's musical rendition of Jean Valjean is perfection. As I describe to others, the theatrical release of Les Misrables last year was great for its cinematic qualities. This version is wonderful for the musical qualities of the show. My only grouse is the whining of Nick Jonas. I know some people love him and defend him based on his limited operatic training, but with a cast so near perfection, it is truly sad that the best they could muster was an old Jonas brother. During the finale when the original London cast performs, Michael Ball as Marius, blows Jonas out of the water. Otherwise, a gorgeous show.",1378166400,,761,4.562043795620438

It arrived a week late for his birthday, but he was delighted with it.  I have read reviews that have really put down the casting of Nick Jonas, and made unkind comments about his voice. That was so unwarranted. He did a good job, and looked the part .He blended very well with Cossette. All the Singers were Fantastic, especially Alfie Boe.

4382958,5,B004I2K4E8,"To begin, I first saw Les MIserables in my hometown about 8 to 10 years ago at our local theater.  My seats were very uncomfortable and I was not familiar with the story.  While I enjoyed it, because of the seating and acoustics at that place, I really could not appreciate the songs or the story.  A few years later I happened to be surfing the channels on my TV and I happened to come upon a PBS broadcast of the 10th Anniversary Concert in London with most of the original cast.  I did not see all of it but what I saw peaked my interest.  I rented it a year later on Netflix and I have not gone back.  I have a tendency to fixate so I then began a search of everything Les Miserables, musical and not musical to include and French version of the story with subtitles.  Not bad rendition.  I have since read Victor Hugo's Tome and believe me it was a trial to read but I read it and finished it.  Obviously we are all aware of the Movie production which walked off with awards galore.

The 25 the Anniversary Album was a welcome addition to my collection.  The voices and production similar to the 10th were excellent.  It was great to see at the end some of the original cast.  This is a beautiful rendition.  Les Miserables enchants me.  I enjoyed the movie but after hereing the 10th and 25th Anniversarys no comparison.  Wonderful acting but voices were only ok.  I just saw an local production in Thomaston Connecticut and the singing level there was superb so much better than the movie.

If you have not owned the previous one, you may think that this is the best les Mis concert. However, the ensembles were a lot better than the previous cast. The only downside of this disc is Nick Jonas. He was uncomparable to Michael Ball, the original cast both in terms of expressing his feeling for Cosette and voices.

Jean Valjean is sung by Alfie Boe and he is magnificent!  His Bring Him Home has become the definitive version, IMO.  Be sure to watch the special guests after the performance.

The feelings that I got from the movie is heighten in this concert like the Prologue and Bring Him Home with Alfie Boe, Lea Salonga's staging time, and Samantha Barks as Eponine is fabulous. I love Ramin Karimloo's Enjolras and Lewis Norm's Javert (like his voice but feel like his portrayal lacks depth).
And how Nick Jonas get cast as Marius is beyond me. Probably his appearance was the main reason and him trying his best is appreciated. However, his voice is weak and it was painful yet amusing to watch him being overpowered just by Samantha and/or Katie, not even to mention the full-flow cast.",1372291200,,704,4.5078125

The lead, Alfie, (ahthough a tremendous singer) can't act, and can't use emotion in his singing.  Every song he sings is in perfect pitch, but doesn't due much else-and Nick Jonas-please, him as Marius????? -  Every time he sang, he took me right out of the show,  Bad choice.

It just doesn't get any better than that!!!!",1372204800,,428,4.797297297297297

4383021,5,B004I2K4E8,"Les Miz is a morality play.

 In the Old Testament, God, the Creator of the Universe, feeds the hungry, comforts the broken-hearted, releases the imprisoned, and defends the weak.  Justice is equated with mercy.  In the New Testament, St. Joseph does not openly condemn Mary. his betrothed, (according to the custom of the times, the Blessed Virgin Mary, being pregnant out of wedlock, would have been stoned to death; her father, according to the Talmud, would have been the one to have to hand her over to the mob) because he was ""a righteous man.""  Again, righteousness is equated with mercy. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells a parable.  God separates the sheep from the goats.  He turns to the sheep and says to them that when he was hungry, they had fed him, when he was in prison they had visited him, when he was sick, they had nursed him.  The sheep were absolutely dumbfounded.  ""When did we see you hungry and feed you...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?"".  Whereupon the Lord God Almighty, King of the Universe, Creator of the heavens and the earth and all flora and fauna therein, informed them that whenever they had performed these acts of kindnesses toward any of the least of these their brethren, they had done it to the Master of the Universe.  Heady stuff that.  The goats did not fare so well.  They were thrown on the trash heap of Gehenna, burned up and forgotten.

There you have it:  the moral conflict between Javert (the pseudo-righteous man) who equates justice and righteousness with The Law and Punishment versus Jean Valjean, (the truly righteous man; the sinner redeemed) who equates justice and righteousness with Mercy and Sacrifice and Protection of the Vulnerable.

The 25th Anniversary Concert (Blu-ray) is magnificent.  The voices are superb.  Superb is an understatement.  I was absolutely blown away.  Although this event is a concert, all the songs are delivered by members of the London cast.  The actors are never out of character.  Les Miz is, essentially, an opera.  Consequently, if all the songs are sung, the story line remains intact. And all the songs are sung.

The first time I saw this performance, I downloaded it on my DVR--all 280 minutes of it--from PBS.  I could not bring myself to erase it . I needed the minutes, so I finally ordered the Blu-ray version from Amazon.  I still did not dare to erase anything until I viewed the DVD and was absolutely certain every minute was included.  You see, at the end, after the curtain calls, the original cast (there have been 4 consecutive casts for the long-running London production) came out.  The audience  went wild.  THEN the four tenors who sang the John Valjean part came out and sang ""Bring Him Home"".  THEN, hundreds of young people who have participated in school productions  marched in singing the stirring call to revolution.  It was truly a night to remember, and I have not told you the half of it.  The original playrights from France were there.  All that was missing was Victor Hugo, risen from the grave, eager to see what West End London hath wrought with his masterpiece.  Best of all, the entirety was recorded on Blu-ray with crisp, sharp video and audio.  I erased the tv version and gained my 280 minutes.  Without regret.  BECAUSE....

Not only did I NOT have to convert dollars into pounds, cross the Atlantic Ocean, reserve a London hotel room, beg the concierge to scalp me some amphitheater tickets, hail a London taxi and tip people to see this historic event, I saw it in my own front row seat, at my own convenience, in my own living room.  A bargain?  No.  A  STEAL !!",1372118400,18,3609,4.687400318979266

4383025,5,B004I2K4E8,Everyone has already said it... but it bears repeating. This concert was a very enjoyable event for fans of Les Miserables. Incredible!,1372032000,,135,5.181818181818182
4383026,5,B004I2K4E8,"The entire production was great... hate to say it but Nick Jonas was the one weak link. He does have star power but didn't hold his own in terms of voice. The two encores led by Colm Wilkinson were amazing.. they literally take your breath away. And the guy from the original cast (Michael Ball), who plays the role that Nick Jonas plays on the DVD, brings tears and passion when he sings out ""The time is here..I fight with him"" meaning that he will stay at the barricade. The song that most moved me, however, was Drink with Me.. maybe partly because I do like to drink but largely because this a group of young idealists who KNOW they are going to die and Drink with Me is about drinking to the good times of the past and about the loneliness and the scary fact that they know they won't survive and yet still believe strongly that the fight must go on. The DVD is a masterpiece.. and I don't think Nick Jonas was bad... it was just not great casting. On the other hand he sang well, was respectful and didn't put himself out there as a star.. just tried to blend in which he did. Norm Lewis is wonderful and Ramin Karimloo is a revelation and has true star power! I would give this production six stars if that were a possibility. I agree that Alfie Boe was fantastic..but do listen to Colm Wilkinson in the encores.. WOW!!",1371945600,,1327,4.290836653386454
4383027,5,B004I2K4E8,"As a complete theatre nerd, I am very critical about shows; the cast, the acting, and the singing have to be spot on for me. I did see the movie that came out and I was a little disappointed because some of the cast members, though great actors, were not great singers and that is sort of the whole point of a musical. The beautiful this about this version is the way there is hardly any stage direction. The actors have to portray everything through their voices and how they act the song. Though this may make it a little bit harder to follow, it allows the person watching it to experience the show in a whole new way. It makes a person pay attention not only to the words of the songs to see what's going on but to really listen to how the writers of the show delicately wrote and produced such a beautiful show. Now I know some of you may be hesitant to watch because of Nick Jonas, and believe me, I was to, but try to see him as Marius and only Marius. If you think about Nick Jonas and his days as a mediocre Disney channel star, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment. I guarantee you this, If you look at the artistry and beauty behind this show, you will love it just as much as I do! Plus, Javert isn't played by Russel Crowe so that's already an improvement!",1371859200,,1284,4.181451612903226

4383030,5,B004I2K4E8,The only disadvantage of watching this production is that it made the movie version seem poor.  Yes the movie was more spectacular but the voices were no comparison.  Jackman was not too bad but the others including Hathaway and Crowe simply did not do the musical justice.  We lost the PBS version we had recorded on TiVo when switching to newer cable-company versions of TiVo and ordered the BluRay Disc as soon as we realized the mistake.  This is a must have if you care for the musical at all.,1371686400,,498,4.5

The movie will provide you with perspective, time line, and clarity. But for sheer talent and enjoyment, the 25th Anniversary Presentation is fantastic! The entire cast is phenominal, and Alfie Bow will always bring me to tears with ""Bring Him Home""! Just the 500 member chorus is worth the ""price of admission""!

Although we LOVE the 10th Anniversary Edition, as well as the movie version with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, this is another very well-done show, and is definitely worth having.  It is fun to see the show with different actors from time to time.  Some of these performers do as well or better than those on the other versions.  And the return of the previous Jean Valjeans -- including Colm Wilkinson -- at the end is neat as well.  Love it!",1369353600,,528,4.346938775510204

Lea Salonga was at her finest-after all, she's Lea Salonga and Ramin Karimloo introduced the power of his vocals and the range. Samantha Barks was shown to be a WONDERFUL stage actress. I don't know if anyone but Jenny Galloway could sing and act the role of Mme Thenardier and Norm Lewis could not be more stellar.

I learned more about the plot from other sources, but if you're looking for the best singing in one ensemble cast, including the chorus, THIS IS IT. Victor Hugo would be proud of this musical adaptation! The Oirginal London Cast appearance at the end was icing on the cake!  A+++++++++",1368835200,,733,4.545454545454546

4383072,5,B004I2K4E8,"I only saw Les Miserables once many years ago on a trip to London.  I remember enjoying the stirring music in the second half but never thought further about it or purchased any recordings.  Ironically a political parody of One More Day on the internet piqued my interest and I saw several of the performances of the 25th anniversary concert on YouTube and I was hooked and purchased the BluRay disc.
The performance is positively breathtaking.  All aspects of the production are superb - lighting, sound, even the staging which is quite convincing despite not being the typical set.
The lead performers are incredible, with a special nod to the amazing Alfie Boe.  He definitely owns the role now.  Norm Lewis as Javier was impressive as was Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Barks as Eponine.  I have obtained the DVD of the 10th anniversary concert and enjoyed it as well.  I don't see how anyone could say which is better although I would give a nod to the 25th (by a hair).  I think that NIck Jonas did a credible job as Marius - he only suffers by comparison with Michael Ball but who wouldn't.  It was great that they were able to cast the wonderful Ramin Karimloo in a relatively minor role when he could easily sing Jean Valjean himself.
As someone has already said, the encores alone are worth the price of the disc with the original cast reprising One More Day.  The Valjean quartet was an wonderful innovation.  I suspect that Colm Wilkinson was an inspiration to all the other singers on the stage.",1368576000,,1513,4.608208955223881

4383081,4,B004I2K4E8,"I am a big fan of Les Mis but already owned the 10th anniversary, the musical movie as well as the complete symphonic recording on CD so I did not need it..  Amazon had this DVD for $7.49 so I could not pass it up.  If you have seen the play and liked it, this is the next best thing.  In comparing the two DVDs, I would say the 10th anniversary has a slightly stronger cast from top to bottom.  Alfie Boe is outstanding and may be as good or better than Colm Wilkinson.  Norm Lewis does a fine job as Javert though not as good as Philip Quast.  Actually, the only weak spot is Nick Jonas as Marius.  He just does not have the voice to do justice to the character.  I found the 10th anniversary production easier to follow for storyline than the 25th, but if you are familiar with the play, you will have no problem.  The video quality of the 25th is superior to the 10th, but it is all about the vocals.  If you were to own only one of them, I would go for the 10th but the 25th is still very good.  I gave it 4 stars because of the Marius part.  He was better than Russell Crowe as Javert in the movie but still the weak link in the production.  Be sure to stick around for the four Valjeans in the finale.",1368144000,3,1208,3.9833333333333334

A huge very enthusiastic audience who clearly knew all the words and singers. The DVD is a celebration and all the songs are sung but it is helpful to know the plot and things between songs are left out. At the end you get to meet the writers and the previous lead singers sing Bring Him Home. You will love this DVD!,1368144000,,448,4.1022727272727275

I don't know whose idea it was to do these musicals as concerts, but they deserve serious kudos.

And of course as a bonus they have the Valjeans, from Colm Wilkinson to Alfie Boe together singing Bring HIm Home.

Another plus (as far as I'm concerned) is that we didn't have to see what was done to Fantine. Lea Salonga brought that across with body language and facial expressions.

I haven't yet seen the recent movie version of Les Mis, but somehow I can't believe it will be better than this.

4383092,4,B004I2K4E8,"I eagerly anticipated viewing this concert and I was not disappointed, except in two aspects [see below].  Alfie Boe, trained as an opera singer, gave a powerful, passionate, emotional performance as ""Jean ValJean.""  Norm Lewis, also a highly-trained and experienced performer, was strong, masterful, articulate as ""Javert"" and played the part with great dignity and authority.  Lea Salonga was exquisite and convincing as the tragic ""Fantine.""  If you saw the 2012 Les Mis Film, you will recognize Samatha Barks in the role of Eponine; she was as confident, powerful, and perfect in her role in this concert as she was in the film. Ramin Karimloo portrayed ""Enjolras"" and gave a powerful performance; he confidently carried the lead in many of the most rousing ensemble songs.  ""Cosette,"" portrayed by Katie Hall was lovely, articulate, strong, and confident but the love story was not realistic because her counterpart, Nick Jonas, who portrayed ""Marius,"" was younger than she and was a less experienced performer.  Robert Madge, as the gamin, ""Gavroche"" was perfect as the young, impish, brave street-wise orphan.

The reason I did not give this recording five stars was for two deficits:  1] the casting of Nick Jonas in the role of 'Marius"" was a disaster:  he was obviously the weak link in the production and was clearly unseasoned, compared to all the superb, experienced opera and musical theater professionals. 2] the casting of Jenny Gallaway, in the role of ""Madame Thenardier"" was a mistake because she was, in fact, twenty years older than Matt Lucas, the performer who portrayed ""Monsieur Thenardier.""

However, the merits of this recording far outweigh the deficits.  I will watch this recording every year and enjoy it each time.  Be sure and watch the performance past the ""curtain calls"" because they the production will include some delightful special guest stars.",1367798400,,1884,5.181518151815181
4383093,5,B004I2K4E8,"Les Miserables 25th Anniversary DVD is Excellent.  Alfie Boe and cast are amazing. The entire concert (symphony, stage lighting/production) are awesome!  Ordered the DVD from Amazon after viewing a section on KNPB, CH 5 Reno.
Very impressive production!  Kudos to all.",1367798400,,268,5.487804878048781
4383094,5,B004I2K4E8,"The music of this concert is simply beautiful.  I however did not think all of the voices were the best sounding except for the two main male characters whose voices were stupendous and their firey duet contrasting each other sent chills through me, perfectly outstanding.  Over all the entire cast did a fabulous job in their characterizations, I really felt moved and the spark of freedom wonderfully conveyed.  Bravo!",1367798400,,420,5.057971014492754
4383095,3,B004I2K4E8,"I love Les Miserables the musical.  It is my all time favorite.  I have both version of Les Mis, 10th and 25th anniversary ""in concert"" and also the Les Mis the movie.  Do not enjoy watching the 25th anniversary much.  It is something that I would prefer to borrow from a library and watch it one time.  I cannot wait for Les Miserables to have a full production of the musical just as Phantom of the Opera 25th anniversary.",1367798400,,424,4.3164556962025316

I was glad I had seen it on You Tube first though because I wouldn't have thought a filmed concert would be that great.  This exceeded my expectations.  It is amazing.",1367712000,,334,4.015151515151516
4383097,3,B004I2K4E8,"There were only three highlights to this production.  The first of which is the production itself.  Brilliantly done and well-executed.  Choreography and staging were superb.  The second highlight was Eponine.  She was superb and the only one of the cast whose performance was equal to or better than the original cast.  The last highlight was the appearance of all of the Jean Valjeans of previous productions as well as several other original cast members.  That was a pleasant surprise and definitely elevated the level of performance.  Except for Eponine all other cast members were sad impersonations of the original cast.  The DVD cover crows about the ""brilliant"" casting choice of some member of a boy band.  He and his boy band may be very popular, but this man does not have the vocal range or depth to play Marius.",1367712000,,825,4.870503597122302

4383100,5,B004I2K4E8,"Seeing this as it was on the stage, is so far  superior to the film.
The music was beyond gorgeous, and not to ruin it for anyone, but at the end, there is a wonderful surprise.
  Alfie Boe delivers as no one else can!

4383102,5,B004I2K4E8,"This is Les Mis in concert.  There are costumes and some scenery to help you to get a feel for things.  This is a beautiful production.  I was not aware that Marius was played by one of the Jonus (sp) brothers until much later since I really don't even know who the Jonus brothers are. The funny thing is that I really liked Marius.  I thought he seemed like a kid in love and in war and he did a great job.  He could have been better on ""Rain will make the flowers grow"" duet but he was amazing on ""empty chairs at empty tables""  I could imagine him as this heartbroken young guy that Marius is.  I loved the inn keeper and his wife.  There were funny and entertaining but not too over the top.
All in all I really enjoyed this!",1367539200,,729,4.048951048951049

4383105,5,B004I2K4E8,"This is a great film for anyone who cares to see a story of God's love for human beings, although the theology is at times erroneous. For example, in the song near the end where Valjean sings, ""To love another person is to see the face of God.""  This cannot be true without mention of faith, for even those who do not believe in Christ can love another person, but it does not follow that they will ""see the face of God"" simply because they, ""love another person.""

That being a necessary caution to just accepting the theology ""as is,"" what really stands out in the film adaptation of the play is how the grace of God still comes through in the mention of mercy, forgiveness and redemption. But God's grace is only available to those who hear of Christ's sacrificial death and rising from the dead.  A Christian would know what this is about.",1367366400,,843,4.425806451612903

4383111,3,B004I2K4E8,"The overall quality of singing was far superior for 10th than 25th, in my opinion. To me that 25th version is more commercialized in order to attract new generation's attention and seek for extending the musical's popularity.",1367020800,,225,5.108108108108108
4383112,5,B004I2K4E8,"In short, les miserables is one of the greatest musicals ever produced for the stage.

4383114,5,B004I2K4E8,"Without question the finest stage rendition of this show I have ever seen.  Alfie Boe is a genius.  He is a man with a voice and presence unrivaled.

All I will say is this......I could have done without Nick Jonas.  He was, without question, the ONLY weak link in this performance.  He belongs on lunch boxes of 12 year old girls.........not in stage performances that would have otherwise been considered one of the finest casts of all time.",1366934400,,443,4.628205128205129

His voice lacked the power of the other performers. Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Barks as Eponine gave stellar performances, as did Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean. Overall a very good performance, but a little less than I was expecting.",1366243200,,409,4.942028985507246

We also both saw the Hollywood movie, which was great but the singing in that movie (especially the singing of Russell Crowe's Javert) just doesn't quite compare to the singing in this!

In my opinion, he is one of the best if not the best.  Everyone in the cast is great particularly, Boe, Norm Lewis as Javert and Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras, the student leader.  The one flaw is Nick Jonas as Marius.  He is nowhere near the same level of quality in both singing voice and acting performance as the rest of the cast.

I have seen the newest film (starting Hugh Jackman Etc.) and the last live tour and found this version to be the best.

Alfred boe is AMAZING as valjean. I cant say i was a huge fan of Nick Jonas as Marius but it doesn't take away from the show at all

If you are a fan of les miserables or just wanting to get a taste of the show i would reccomend seeing this film.
it may be a bit confusing if this is your first time watching les mis (since it is done concert style and therefor there is not a ton of movement and some parts are left out if they are not sung)",1364860800,,734,3.88

4383175,4,B004I2K4E8,"I caught the second act of this concert on P.B.S a while back and I liked it so I bought it. Unfortunatley I wish I had seen the first act. I was very unhappy with the Vulgarity and Raunchy-ness of Lovely Ladies and Master of the House. Also the excessive use a certain swear word was Very unnecessary. But despite this it is a beautiful story with a gloriouse score and I enjoyed it Immensly so here is my character by character review.

Jean Valjean- The main charcter in the story of les Miserables and let me tell you Alfie Bow was PERFECT!! His voice is AWESOME and he puts sooo much into his performance. His Bring him home was GORGEOUS and a definite highlight of the show.

Javert- Norm Lewis is fantastic in this role his Star actually had me crying. He may be an unconventional Javert to most of you Philip Quast fans but no one can deny that he should have been in the movie instead of YOU KNOW WHO. Norm Lewis is great as Javert and shall forever be THE Javert in my mind.

Fantine- In the role of fantine wwe have another Huge name Lea Salonga. Her facial emotions were spot on and her voice is beautiful. I literally cried when she became a prostitute. I was like ""POOR FANTINE"" Her I dreamed a dream was also another tear jerker (In case you haven't guess I cried a WHOLE LOT while watching this)

Marius- Now there has been a lot of angry word about Nick Jonas in the role of Marius and I will admit I was Horrified when I saw he was in this but I still watched it and Nobody kill me but I really liked his Marius. He brought a softness to the character that I feel was laking in Michael Balls Legendary performance in the 10th anniversary concert. Overall he did a great job and his voice is very smooth. But I can never forgive Marius for not loving Eponine :).

Cosette- Oh Cosette as beautiful as you are I can never forgive you for stealing Marius from Eponine. but Katie Hall I can forgive because her voice is lovely and she captures all of the innocence sweetness a cosette must have.

Eponine- Now we are onto my favorite female Character in the show. Samantha Barks IS Eponine she has crazy awesome vocals and she can belt like insanity. Her on my own is Great and I weeped when she and Nick sang a little fall of rain.

Enjolras- I will tell you straight off Enjolras is my favorite person in the show he has all the best songs and he is awesome. But the best thing about this Enjolras is RAMIN KARIMLOO IS HIM!!!!! Ramin Karimloo is my favorite singer ever so this Enjolras obviously is AMAZING he can sing like.... I can't even explain how Awesome he is! Just look him up on youtube or something.

The Thenardians- I will tell you right off the bat I don't like these characters. I just don't but I will admit I laughed once or twice so I guess they did there job.

This is the end of my review so I hope it helps. If you do buy this movie I would caution you on the Raunchy-ness of certain parts and the over-usage of swear words. But overall it is a heartwarming story with great music and....RAMIN KARIMLOO. He makes everything better :)!",1364774400,,3070,4.261168384879725

Samantha Barks- WONDERFUL! I love her. And then Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser are in it.... I have no words. They're just so soo amazing and outstanding!! Norm Lewis wasn't bad, but personally not my favorite. Lea Salonga was Great! Katie Hall has a beautiful voice and I really enjoyed her as Cossette. I personally did not like Nick Jonas as Marius, but he wasn't too bad. This movie is so great! I have seen it 4 times already and i've only had it for a few days...
PS: If you like Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser, I would definitely recommend watching/buying The Phantom of the Opera 25th Anniversary at the Royal Albert Hall. ITS AMAZING!! Even better than Les Miserables in my opinion. Sierra, Hadley, and Ramin make such an excellent cast! It's absolutely my favorite Production!

So I decided to get this Blu Ray from Amazon, and boy and I glad that I did. The performance, as described on it's title, celebrates the first 25 Years that this Musical had hit the stages, including Broadway. I was surprised to see how popular of a Musical this way, but more surprised when Nick Jonas, one of the Jonas Brothers, took part in this performance.

These are the songs I like from this performance; Look Down (the prologue song), Castle on a Cloud, I Dreamed a Dream, Master of the House, and the Epilogue Version of Do You Hear The People Sing. When there was an announcement, after the show, that a Movie Version of the Les Miz Musical was being worked on, I was surprised. A few years later, I saw the Movie with my friend, Sheryll, and it was beautiful, especially with it's New Song which I will not describe the name of; don't want to cause any spoilers.

25 Years, and still counting, it is now the year 2013, and I saw the Movie Musical Version, but that's another story. I should've learned about this Musical back when I was still young, but I guess it's never too late to do so. I checked out the 25th Anniversary of Phantom of the Opera after this, but again, that's another story.

4383221,5,B004I2K4E8,"[Opening Note: I am not at all a theater or opera connoisseur (I saw the 2012 film and thought I'd check out a stage version, which might be heresy to some). The nuances that others may observe are still worth considering, but this review is written as one who doesn't much mind how ""powerful"" a voice is or how much it stays true to the original, and so, I think, may be more useful for others in a similar, lowly state when approaching musicals.]

Practically everything in this rendition of Les Miserables is perfect. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is beyond description; he doesn't have an off moment, and be brings every lyrical twist to it's highest level. He is especially well-paired with Norm Lewis (Javert), whose intersinging pieces work so well. Likewise, all of the other performers are great and, in my opinion, gave better performances than those present in the 10th anniversary edition.

Nick Jonas has been lampooned in some reviews because he's not operatic. That might be true (and I have no idea what decision-making process landed him this role) but personally I find his performance as Marius to be the best I've seen among the movie and other stage versions available on Youtube. He has a very good blend of smooth singing, emotional distortion, and realistic inflection.

The sound and orchestra are very good as well: clean, expressive, and always enhancing the singers' performances. The two encore pieces with past cast members was also a great addition.

One other thing I like about the stage version is that the less-well composed pieces between the big show tunes are far less prominent than in the movie. Since there isn't any acting or as much of a slowed pace due to the movie's acting focus over singing, these problems just appear and are gone without much notice, which improves it substantially in my opinion.

4383223,5,B004I2K4E8,"We've been fans for a couple decades. However , not a big fan of Nick Jonas in this lineup and he was overly promoted. Jonas sounds a bit nasally but gives an OK performance. The rest of the cast is superb and delivers excellent emotion. Stellar encore performance with multiple historic casts coming up on stage to perform, worth every penny!
Picture and sound quality are awesome, blow our DVD versions away.",1362009600,,410,4.708333333333333

4383225,5,B004I2K4E8,"I have seen this play many times in theater as well as the new movie. This 25th anniversary does an amazing job capturing the intensity and beauty of this play, all without them acting it! AMAZING!!!",1361836800,,199,4.555555555555555
4383226,5,B004I2K4E8,"My friend showed me this one day, and I was pretty skeptical of it at first. Since then, I have watched it multiple times and it is easily my favorite musical.",1361836800,,159,4.161290322580645
4383227,5,B004I2K4E8,Stunning...moving...heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time.  Wonderfully produced and directed.  Mr Boe is simply a show stopper.  It brings tears to my eyes.,1361836800,,168,5.64
4383228,5,B004I2K4E8,"I have watched this DVD more than 10 times. Amazing casts and beautiful voices. If you are a musicals fan, you should not miss this one.",1361836800,,136,4.269230769230769
4383229,1,B004I2K4E8,"Although the performance is good, I expected the 25th anniversary that aired in PBS to be on this disc.  I was sorely disapointed.",1361750400,3,130,4.6521739130434785
4383230,5,B004I2K4E8,"This film is a live recording of a concert version of the play, not the full production of the musical, so don't expect any acting. That's apparently due to the fact that full rights to the play are very expensive because of the recent movie. So the singers perform at microphones at the front of the stage.

The singing is terrific and this format allows you to appreciate the music more. Especially after the singing of the actors in the movie, which was mostly mediocre but ranged from extremely good (especially the beautiful Samantha Barks as Eponine, who plays the same role in this concert version) to the truly awful off-tune attempts of Russel Crowe, a fine actor who should never sing outside the shower.",1361664000,,714,4.712

4383233,5,B004I2K4E8,The music is beautiful. I can watch it over and over. Alfie Boe is one if the best Balkans I've had the pleasure of listening to.,1361577600,,129,4.0
4383234,4,B004I2K4E8,It was a very interesting DVD. The Royal Albert Hall is incredible and the fact that it was an Anniversary Edition made it more interesting. I was surprised that the Singers just stood there in front of microphones rather than actually acting out the parts. The movie which is up for an Oscar was much more realistic and I loved the movie! The Music is lovely!,1361491200,,360,4.46969696969697
4383235,5,B004I2K4E8,I went and saw the movie Les Miserables in Theaters; that was the first time I saw anything related to Les Mis and it was awesome! So I came home and googled Les Mis and found this watched it! Loved it! Just hd to buy this. The man who plays Jevert is wonderfully talented! All the songs are very good.,1361491200,,302,4.05
4383236,5,B004I2K4E8,"I have seen this play at least 7 times in the city I live in. Seeing it reproduced after being in production for 25 years, gives me goosebumps every time! I cry every time I watch it!",1361404800,,183,3.972972972972973
4383237,4,B004I2K4E8,I've seen this great musical twice before in London theaters. I loved the new re orchestrated music for the Royal Albert Hall event. Great music + spectacular show...,1361404800,,166,4.964285714285714
4383238,5,B004I2K4E8,"So I came across this on youtube maybe a year ago and added it to my playlist, which I'd then stick on repeat. Kept replaying this over and over. Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals--even more so than Phantom of the Opera--and I will never grow tired of the music. IMO, no one (besides maybe Colm Wilkinson in the OLC recording) can quite pull off the same feelings as Alfie as Jean Valjean. I wish that he and Norm Lewis (Javert) were in the new movie, but that didn't happen, unfortunately. Norm Lewis has ruined the role of Javert for me--I don't think that anyone else would be able to do it as well as him--he and Alfie really start to get the feelings stirring and their voices are powerful.",1361318400,,707,4.363636363636363
4383239,2,B004I2K4E8,Was not as good as the 10th Anniversary concert. Did not like the performers. Was not worth watching more than 10 minutes.,1361232000,,122,4.590909090909091
4383240,4,B004I2K4E8,"This was an okay concert and way better musically than the movie made this year with Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway but I believe the 10th anniversary version was better.  Some stars in this rendition, like Norm Lewis as Javert, were outstanding.",1361145600,,247,4.880952380952381
4383241,5,B004I2K4E8,This is a fantastic production and will appeal to any Les Mis fan. The singing is spectacular! I highly recommend.,1361145600,,114,4.75
4383242,5,B004I2K4E8,"The music is wonderful.  It is worth every cent I paid for it.  The London Production is great.  ""Les Miserables"" and the London Production of ""The Phantom of the Opera, 25th aniversary""  are great to watch.",1361145600,,207,4.666666666666667
4383243,5,B004I2K4E8,"I love all the music of Les Miserables.  I kept watching this concert over and over again on YouTube and then after the movie came out, it was gone.  So I ordered the DVD from Amazon.  I loved all the performances, all the signing was awesome.  I know some people had a problem with Nick Jonas as Marius but I don't think he was all that bad.  I love the movie too, but to just listen to the music, I prefer this concert.",1361145600,,421,4.024096385542169

4383248,4,B004I2K4E8,This is a beautifully produced concert version of the beloved musical. Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are simply amazing as Jean Valjean and Javert. The orchestrations are stunning. Te only weak link is Nick Jonas as Marius. Poor casting there. He needs to atsy in the Pop genre because his voice does not compliment a classical sound and thre is nothing Pop about Les Miz music,1360886400,,372,4.651515151515151

4383253,5,B004I2K4E8,I saw this production on TV not too long ago and couldn't wait to have it on DVD.  The movie was good.  This is GREAT.  I get chills during every musical number.  Awesome.,1360713600,,171,4.090909090909091

4383255,5,B004I2K4E8,Rented the DVD via Netflix but this Blu Ray version is absolutely incredible for sound. Definitely worth the few extra dollars if you have a blu-ray player and surround sound.,1360627200,,175,4.866666666666666
4383256,5,B004I2K4E8,What a great performance.  Wonderful to see the old London cast and new cast sing together.  Such a moving rendition.,1360627200,,117,4.8
4383257,5,B004I2K4E8,"Got this for my sisters who love Les Miserables, the only negative thing is Nick Jonas attempting to sing with real professionals. He is severely out classed and over powered. It made me frustrated to hear him squeak along side an extremely talented cast.",1360454400,,255,4.818181818181818

4383264,5,B004I2K4E8,"Fantastic concert, as noted by others though the finale is worth the purchase alone.  The BluRay production is tremendous and made it better than the 10 year concert.",1360022400,,166,4.928571428571429
4383265,5,B004I2K4E8,Best cast yet!! Wonderful!!! I've watched it over and over and it just gets better each time! I think I'll watch it again.,1359936000,,122,4.3478260869565215
4383266,5,B004I2K4E8,"If you a  lover of the Les Miz then you have to own this.  Great show plus they bring back the original cast at the end.  Alfie Boe has a really bellowing voice with lots of heart an passion.  Nothing can beat the stage presentation of this show.  Buy it, you will watch it over and over",1359936000,,287,3.9649122807017543
4383267,2,B004I2K4E8,"By now, fans know every line of the score. Cutting sections leaves awkward gaps where the listener anticipates words that never come.

Casting was also less than optimal. Visually, Norm Lewis has the sternness and the drive for the role of Javert, but his voice lacks the emotional range that made Philip Quast's performance so memorable. Nick Jonas seems to be winking at the camera in every frame. Alfie Boe brings youth and vitality to his role... but Valjean is better known for his resignation and weariness.

The physical placement of the actors on the stage did little to enhance my appreciation of this version. I had a hard time seeing the intimacy between the characters when they were standing half a stage apart using separate microphones.",1359936000,,751,4.905511811023622
4383268,4,B004I2K4E8,Other than the Jonas brother attempting to stretch his talent this edition is well worth having in your collection. Gave several as gifts with approving reception.,1359849600,,163,5.3076923076923075

4383276,5,B004I2K4E8,"Being someone that has been to see this show live in a number of locations, including the West End, this blu-ray captures the energy perfectly.  The whole show is played out with extreme heart thumbing passion that you will want to crank up the volume to feel the energy.

Then as soon as its all over, it starts again!  Well not quite, but the original show cast come out, and sing key songs with their modern counterparts and it is wonderful to hear the original voices with the new.  Fantastic.

Blu-Ray delivers a crisp sound and a beautiful image to accompany this musical delight.",1359504000,,586,4.596153846153846

One of the great wonders of the world for me is why Hugh Jackman was chosen to play the same role in the new movie....Alfie Boe's voice is so much more.  This stage play has phenominal singing in it.  At the very end, the original cast from 25 years ago comes on stage, and they all sing once again, a beautiful thing.  It is so amazing....I watched it again last night, and it once again brought me to tears.",1359331200,,541,4.163461538461538

I didn't know about the story line, except for parts of it I saw on TV. So I went with them and saw the movie and was sold on the story and the music, so much that I had to buy ths CD. I also purchased a DVD for them as well and they loved it. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean was mesmerizing as were the rest of the cast. The only negative thing was I wished the performers were miked instead of having to walk up to the microphones and do their part. It was a little distracting, but not a major one. I have never written a review about any of the products I've purchased on Amazon, but this had to be an exception. Anyone out there who is a Les Miserables fan has to have this edition in their collection. I also purchsed the audio CD along with the DVD and was amazed at the quality of the product.

When I go to a live play or musical the least thing I expect is to see credible performances and let me ask: who is going to believe that Salonga is the mother of a blonde child?, besides she still has her strong accent even when singing that I thought I was hearing to Pacquiao. Samantha Barks should be Fantine, period. Other point I want to said, most of the performances were just to step on the front and sing like when you go to a high school festival and listen to the students. The majority of the protagonists didn't act at all.
Honestly, I don't recommend it.",1358899200,,724,4.41044776119403

Did they cast an opera singer as Valjean?  I prefer Colm with his grand, yet sensitive voice.

Otherwise, loved all the performers in this version of the musical.  Surprised that a Jonas brother could pull-off the part of Marius so well, and that such a young Samantha Banks has such an impressive voice.  All others were worthy of this DVD purchase.

Highly recommended performance as long as you can get past the operatic Valjean.",1358726400,,498,4.8

4383309,5,B004I2K4E8,"This concert managed to round up such a talented cast. Alfie Boe is spectacular as Jean Valjean. All of his songs are full of power and resonates with pure grace and elegance. Norm Lewis is without a doubt the best Javert ever. There aren't enough words of praise to be used for this man, just absolutely breathtaking and amazing. Samantha Barks is the perfect Eponine, with so much emotion and sincerity in her singing that it's always heartbreaking.
I absolutely loved Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras, beautiful singing coupled with an intensity fit for the role of a revolutionary student hungry for a new world. And Katie Hall was incredible as Cosette. Normally Cosette's role is somewhat overshadowed by the more devastating stories of Fantine, Jean, and even Eponine, but I feel that Katie did a great job making Cosette so much more dynamic. She has a very beautiful voice and also adds a little more to the role in her acting. Matt Lucas is Thenardier, perfect casting. All of the students were right on the mark as well. Hadley Fraser as Grantaire puts more heart into the role than I'd seen before. Killian, Jamie, Alistair, Owain stood out in their roles. This was a great concert in general with talented singers and actors. Still on the fence about Nick Jonas as Marius, though.",1358726400,,1287,4.7757847533632285

4383316,3,B004I2K4E8,"In the 25h Anniversary Concert we see that lightning really does rarely strike twice. 15 years ago a ""Dream Cast"" of Les Miserables was assembled to perform the shows music in a concert venue. The concert was engaging and the cast was perfect straight down the line, from the iconic Colm Wilkinson as Valjean all the way down the massive assembly of ensemble members who flanked the rear of the stadium lending awesome power to the big group numbers.

The same rave comments can't be said of the 25th Anniversary set. The Valjean has a pretty voice, but hardly lacks the fierce vigor that the role often demands, Javert is black, which may sound racist however in the 1830s in France it is a near impossibility that someone of African descent could have ascended to the level of Inspector... that's just history. From there it continues to get more questionable. Lea Salonge, who appeared in the 10th Anniversary Cast as Eponine, played the role of Fantine which I can only assume was done for the sake of nostalgia. While Salonge is a brilliant performer her performance of Fantine wasn't nearly as powerful as her Eponine 15 years prior... however I respect the opinion of those who say this is comparing apples to oranges. The biggest disappointment was the publicity stunt of Nick Jonas performing the role of Marius. Despite what the Disney Channel may have misled him into believing the boy is not an MT performer and it shows, the kid has a good voice but is straining to act at the same time. Pair that with a lack luster and operatic Cosette and you are reminded how important it is to have a strong pair for the lovers in order to preserve momentum (Something the recently released film captured quite well). The silver lining in this 25th cast is the presence of Samantha Barks as Eponine, who would later reprise the role in the 2012 film version. Admittedly she is not quite as good as Salonge in this particular version and arguably she comes into her own when doing the film, but for sheer nostalgia this is a good place to see where she came from before the film.

So despite having something to be desired in the cast, I can't really say that it is ALL bad. The upswing is that the 25th is arguably a more ""complete"" performance than the Dream Cast featuring virtually the whole show including the more dialogic sections omitted in the 10th Anniversary. The other significant bonus to this version is the encore performances. While slightly less powerful than the International Valjean's from the 10th, the diverse array of numbers and old faces returning for this is substantial and does the heart of any Les Mis fan good.

In short if you are a die hard, pick this up. Though it is not the definitive recording of the show in my opinion it offers certain unique elements that make it a worthwhile purchase, especially for the currently low price.",1358640000,,2865,4.658102766798419

I have recently seen the movie, along with most of you.  I think that we all need to remember that the stage performance is more about the incredible music and voices whereas the movie is more about the acting and the visual.  That said, I recommend that you see it on stage first...you will never forget it.. Then I recommend any fan to own both the 10th and 25th AND the movie when it's available.  The original cast was top notch with Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Philip Quast, etc.  The 25th has the wonderful Alfie Boe, Ramin Karimloo,John Owen-Jones and the 1985 cast.  And the finales are worth it alone.  In several reviews I note the criticism of Nick Jonas.  I kind of feel sorry for him as he was so out of his league and he looks visibly uncomfortable at times.  I know he probably wanted to hide when Michael Ball sang his part and it was fantastic.  Many pop stars have done musicals: Donnie Osmond, Andy Gibb, Madonna, Ricky Martin etc.(I know I'm missing a lot) but unfortunately this didn't work.  However, it was a small distraction and the DVD is something I will cherish.",1358467200,,1245,4.460176991150442

It is so well done, using costuming & minimal props & not just the cast singing each song in order.  It is nearly a full production & what makes it better is the encore(s) during which time the original cast members join the others on stage & sing.  The highlight of the entire production was when all 4 of the actors who have played Jean Valjean came together & sang both individually and together!  It is truly amazing!

4383332,4,B004I2K4E8,"I'm not going to review the content of the DVD because it is excellent and deserves 10 stars. Or maybe 9 since they stuck Nick Jonas in there. :-P  Though I will note that this is the same Les Miserables concert that was aired on PBS a while back. It is not a full length production, but a CONCERT. So music and songs only, not scenes. But in all fairness, it didn't need to be longer than 2 and a half hours anyway. I just needed to watch this and hear the beautiful music again in order to erase the memory of the terrible caterwauling in the new movie. This is how it sounds when it's sung well.

Anyway, I give this product 4/5 because the DVD does not have any kind of credits or chapter listings inside the box. All I received was the DVD case (as pictured) with the DVD inside. There was no info about the product or show at all: no cast list, music credits, and etc. I thought that was a little ghetto. But I enjoyed the DVD none the less.",1358294400,,947,4.086021505376344

Alfie Boe has an awesome voice and captures the pain of Jean ValJean. Lea Salonga has such a pure voice that it just tears at you and Samantha Barks as Eponine, well, that's as great as it get's. My wife has gone to see the play on Broadway and said that I should see it. I'm not much for musicals, but the melodies wind through the story just bring you along. This is a concert performance at the O2 in London and it amazes me that the performers convey the feeling of the play, while standing at the mics. Joe Jonas (as Marius), has a voice that's not up to the strength of the veteran stage performers, but really puts his all into "" Empty Chairs and Empty Tables"". Norm Lewis as Javert conveys the rigid moral character that epitomizes the character. If you get this, make sure you watch at the end where all four performers who have played Jean ValJean perform together, it's freaking amazing.

His rendition of ""Bring Him Home"" is beyond breathtaking and the finale, featuring a quartet of Jean Valjeans, including Colm Wilkinson from the original 1985 cast, is AMAZING!  To be clear to potential buyers, this presentation of Les Mis is a concert performance, and, therefore, does not feature the usual dramatic acting and cast interactions you would expect in a typical musical theatre production.  Not including the finale, this performance is also shorter as a few, less essential, elements have been cut from the production in the interest of saving time.  Despite the concert format, each performer still manages to deliver a wonderful dramatic performance, albeit in front of a stage microphone.  Lea Salonga as ""Fantine"", Norm Lewis as ""Javert"" and several favorites from London's West End including Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser, round out this spectacular cast that bring this musical to life in a truly memorable performance that you will want to see again and again!  One common criticism folks have regarding this production is Nick Jonas, as ""Marius"".  I think he does tend to sound a little too ""pop-y"" at times for what is essentially a modern opera, but does well overall.  I made the mistake of watching this production before seeing the new movie version of Les Mis- so the vocal performances in the movie were extremely disappointing in comparison (and that's putting it mildly).  If you have already seen the movie, I suggest that you buy or rent the 25th Anniversary production of this powerful musical if you would like to experience what the music of Les Mis is meant to be like: powerful, emotional and vividly spectacular!",1357862400,,1829,5.046511627906977
4383359,4,B004I2K4E8,"Although this has excellent sound, the orchestra is muffled (the 10th Anniversary's orchestra is crystal clear in comparison) and Nick Jonas left a lot to be desired in terms of vocal power. Katie Hall's voice was also on the weak side. Aside from that, Norm Lewis as Javert was absolutely brilliant, conveying a tremendous range of emotions, just with his voice. The staging, even as a concert, was also excellent, far above that of the 1995 presentation. Not having to flip the disc in the middle of the concert is an added plus and the added bonus of the four Valjeans and comments by Mackintosh and collaborators was a welcome addition. The 10th anniversary concert is still the best recorded and this represents a welcome addition on blu-ray.",1357862400,,747,4.84375

4383375,5,B004I2K4E8,this was such a great show. One of my favorite plays. I think the best part is the end when they bring the original case plus the others over the last 25 years together. A must see.,1357516800,,181,3.918918918918919

4383378,5,B004I2K4E8,"Absolutely wonderful! Boe, Lewis, Solanga, Barks and Karimloo are especially excellent. The orchestra is outstanding (I can't emphasize this enough)! Plus the encores at the end... The setting at the O2... You'll watch this over and over.

The Amazon review was unenthusiastic about Jonas, and I have to agree. It's not unacceptable though. But there are times when he is singing along with Karimloo and Boe's characters and the contrast is obvious and unflattering. But the Marius character is torn between his commitment at the barricade and his new love for Cosette, and Jonas presents that just fine, generally.

The Amazon reviewer also said, ""Lea Salonga is now Fantine, and while she sings well, the part really calls for more vocal power."" Huh? Salonga seems to epitomize power in her singing here.

Alfie Boe is triumphant in this concert. What an extraordinary talent!

Buy it. Put it on, crank your speakers up. Powerhouse orchestra, massive supporting chorus, well-cast singers on stage. Get ready to have your socks knocked off.",1357516800,,1041,5.1420118343195265

4383382,5,B004I2K4E8,"OK, Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman were good, but this video will put it all in perspective. Alfie Boe is great here - possibly the best Jean Valjean ever. And Lea Salonga is always good. The rest of the cast is excellent too.  Definitely a must buy.",1357516800,3,250,4.319148936170213

4383387,5,B004I2K4E8,"This staging, performance and recording is of the finest calibre. I have now enjoyed this performance six times over the past couple months and it's impact doesn't diminish. I don't know how it sounds on two small built-in speakers in most TVs, adequate I'm sure. My playback is on a 52"" Sony Bravia feeding a Sony ES series receiver powering seven restored KLH model Five speakers. The spectacle is dramatic and the sound is magnificent and both reveal the talents of all that performed, participated, assisted, recorded and attended this incredible performance! I am awed! Cast, chorus, orchestra, conductor/director, staging, lighting, sound, audience all combine to create a performance that draws you in as if you are there live in the best seats in the house!

After attending the movie with children and older grandchildren (which I thought was excellent but not to be compared with the stage production in any way), I decided to share this production with some of them so they could enjoy the background and amazing singing voices of the performers from stage productions.  I know they will be moved as I am every time I listen to the marvelous and soul shaking music of Les Miserables in a very different way than they saw it in the movie theater.",1357171200,,859,4.601307189542483

4383404,5,B004I2K4E8,"As with most concert versions of musicals, this production features stellar production values in the voice and instrumental departments while only ""suggesting"" the stage action instead of having the performers enact the show in full.

This should not put you off. I myself had never seen Les Miz in any other format and found this performance easy to follow and entirely enjoyable.

As others have suggested, only Nick Jonas is a bit out of place amongst the rest of the singers, since his pop-music voice lacks a certain depth and cannot sustain a vocal line. Nonetheless he does a charming job and certainly looks the part of Marius. His acting is quite good too.

Special mention must be given to the encore event that follows the main performance. It goes on for about a half-hour and is not to be missed -- whatever you do, do not stop watching after the final chorus of the show! I won't spoil it for anyone, but there is one delightful surprise after another. The result was quite moving even for someone like me, who has not been a lifelong fan of this show.

Highly recommended to anyone who has an interest in musical theater.",1357084800,,1136,4.63681592039801

4383409,5,B004I2K4E8,"The 25th anniversary to Les Mis was my first introduction to the musical.  And as a lover of all the classic musicals, I'm clueless as to why I knew nothing about Les Mis.  It is now my number one musical on my top ten list.  Every song touches me in someway and hearing Alfie Boe sing ""Bring Him Home"" is so emotional that the audience has to stand up to show their appreciation even before the end of the show.  Norm Lewis who plays Javert  never verrs from his role of trying to capture Jean Valjean by pulling you in with his stunning rendition of ""Stars"" . Ramin Karimloo who plays Enjoiras leads his fellow patriots with his powerful tenor voice, as he sings ""Red and Black"". Both women Fantine and Eponine have voices that lead you wanting more from them. Matt Lucas  who plays Thenardier brings a lighter side to the musical and makes you want to start dancing with the chorus. Lastly Nick Jonas and  Katie Hall who play Marius and Cosette look well together but it is Nick who at times doesn't come through as a young man madly in love with the beautiful Cosette. I can honestly say I did think Nick pulled off his version of ""Empty chairs & Empty tables"" but it is Katie's voice that steals the show when the two duet together.  Lastly there are no words to describe the whole cast as they sing ""Do You Hear The People Sing"" and One Day More. Les Miserables is a Masterpiece.",1356998400,,1385,4.341085271317829

Also saw the recent (2012) film, which features drama and realism over pure music, and also like it very much. After watching and listening to this concert on YouTube, I purchased it the same day. It is a superb cast, especially Alfie Boe and Samantha Barks; I believe they are the best Jean Valjean and Eponine yet. Boe's"" Bring Him Home"" is the purest, most beautiful I've ever heard and Samantha's ""On My Own"" is both beautiful and full of emotion.",1356912000,,612,4.572727272727272

He's so below the standard set by everyone else in the cast, it's laughable.  He's really, really bad.  Other than that, it's an excellent performance.

I didn't think that Nick Jonas belonged among this cast of exceptional performers. Perhaps someday with more training he might have a chance of being worthy of some of them but he didn't cut it at all. It was purely a decision to pull in the younger crowd. However the Star performance was Norm Lewis. When the show started and he came out I was incredibly annoyed because I was being close minded and he didn't look the part. Then he sang and I Stopped breathing. He has the most beautiful voice that I have ever heard and even my sibling who tends to dislike musicals sat with me and rewatched ""stars"" multiple times just to hear him sing. The rest of the cast was almost as good.",1356652800,,824,4.427631578947368

4383431,5,B004I2K4E8,I first saw this concert on PBS. I was literally moved to tears by Alfie Boe's rendition of Bring Him Home. I liked that this cast takes you through the story through music. It has made me into a die hard Les Miserable die hard fan!,1356480000,,232,4.065217391304348

4383434,5,B004I2K4E8,Les Misrables is one of my all time favorite plays and this was an excellent addiction to my collection of Les Mis concert DVDs. This is by far my favorite performance.

The entire cast is perfect.  Even Nick Jonas as Marius grew on me.  I own the 2010 cast recording, but it does not compare.  I WISH there was a music CD for this performance so we could play it in the car.",1356393600,3,356,4.253731343283582

4383439,3,B004I2K4E8,"Well, although I enjoyed this 25th Anniversary DVD, it was not up to the level of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast. Nick Jonas, as numerous other reviewers have pointed out, is out of his league when compared to the other cast members. His forlorn look didn't bother me as much as his lack of vocal training. Again, not a bad voice, just out of his league.
Although Alfie Boe is not Colm Wilkerson, I enjoy his Valjean, and enjoy the contrast to Wilkerson's portrayal.
I do miss the ""Little People"" that Gavroche sings that was not included in this DVD--it would only have added a few seconds to the running time, but it added a certain poignancy to the barricade scene.
Many other reviewers have complained about Lea Salonga's Fantine--I liked her portrayal, and didn't find her voice or interpretation lacking.
The technical aspects of this production are excellent, as other have noted. Unless you only want one version of Les Miserables, this is a useful addition to one's video collection. Now I am waiting for either a fully recorded performance with all the acting, scenery, and props, or the forthcoming movie, or both, to have a version which allows me to not just enjoy the music, but also get lost in the story.",1356307200,,1221,4.710280373831775

4383446,2,B004I2K4E8,"I know this review will probably be unpopular, but right from the beginning this play smacks of bad writing.  There's just way too much expository and not enough action.  The characters explain too much. It would have been much better to show us what happens rather than having a character explain how he/she got to where they're at.",1356134400,,333,4.724137931034483
4383447,4,B004I2K4E8,"It is difficult to follow the story in this edition. The screen above the actors had some images pictured on it thru-out the performance that would have helped explain the storyline, however it is rarely seen. If you are new to the musical, I suggest the 10th Anniversary edition, which has scene subtitles, or seeing it live first.",1356048000,2,332,4.741379310344827

4383456,5,B004I2K4E8,"In anticipation of the film coming out on Christmas, I decided I needed to familiarize myself with the full score.  I've never seen the show but had heard a couple of the songs over the years.  I was blown away by this concert presentation, and listened to it at least once a day the first week I discovered it.  This is truly a dream cast (well, almost) and Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is phenomenal.  I'm talking tears and goosebumps.  Be sure to watch all the encores -- while I don't believe any rendition can ever top Boe's Bring Him Home, the 4 Valjeans do come close. If only they could have found another Marius...  this one weakness in the cast is unfortunate, but not enough to take away a star.",1355875200,2,703,4.32824427480916
4383457,4,B004I2K4E8,"Les Miserables is one of my all-time favorite musicals. I have watched both the 10th and 25th anniversary editions as well gotten the opportunity to see it live on Broadway.

Overall, the cast was very good. Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean), Norm Lewis (Javert), and Ramin Karimloo (Enjolras) brought powerhouse vocals to the 25th anniversary production.  I thought Samantha Barks did a wonderful job as Eponine.  Although usually overlooked in reviews, Katie Hall made me actually like Cosette's character for the first time.  I like Jenny Galloway as Madame Thenardier, but her performance wasn't as spirited as in the 10th anniversary.  Matt Lucas is definitely over the top as Thenardier, so that may take some getting used to.  Lea Salonga (Fantine) is enchanting as usual. The only fly in the ointment is Nick Jonas as Marius. For not having much Broadway experience/training, he did a decent job. It is just painful to watch his strained facial expressions.  When put next to some of the other powerhouse vocalists, it makes his vocals seem much weaker than they actually are and takes away from this concert as a whole.

However, you won't want to miss the performances at the end of ""Bring Him Home"" by four Valjeans including Colm Wilkinson and ""One Day More"" by some of the original west end/10th anniversary cast.  The new orchestrations are also a lovely addition.

At the end of the day, I think this is one production that is worth seeing if you are a fan of Les Miserables.  However, for the uninitiated or those who only want one concert DVD in their collection, you may want to check out the 10th anniversary concert first.",1355875200,2,1633,4.838129496402877

4383461,5,B004I2K4E8,"Wonderful. Emotional. Perfect in its simplicity.

Yes, the Marius character was the weakest vocally, but he made up for it with his depth during Empty Chairs. I thought he played the character sweetly.

4383462,5,B004I2K4E8,"I've seen Les Miz twice on stage and own several versions on DVD, but this 2010 25th Anniversary version is absolutely
breathtaking. The main cast of outstanding professionals is supported by an ""army"" of chorus and  musicians. The creative
team responsible for bringing this 25th anniversary production to the stage has brought Les Miz to new heights that I
never thought possible. Get the Blu Ray version if you can...and if you own a big screen TV and quality component sound

4383463,4,B004I2K4E8,"I can't compare it to the 10th anniversary edition, since I haven't seen that, although I now plan to. In fact, I was only familiar with the book. However, I did see the live stage version, I've seen some remarks about the stage version. AFAIK, the 25th was only presented in concert format. With the exception of the closeups and, of course, the encores, this version is what I saw on stage. The strong points were the performances of Boe, Lewis, Salonga and Karimloo. I can't really add much to what's been already said about Jonas. I'm merely a competent tenor and I realized suddenly while listening that I have more resonance and projection than he. He was actually worse in the live performance. His voice got lost much more there. I think they actually enhanced him a bit for this recording.

One more petty gripe caused me to subtract a star. The video quality was not what I expected, so far as resolution. I watched the cloud version on a new computer with a 24"" LED monitor. I understand the quality on the 10th anniversary version is worse, so I may just buy that CD.",1355875200,3,1079,4.505102040816326

The music is fantastic, with virtually every other number being a show stopper. The anniversary is a concert version of the original production. Those who have not seen the show and who are unfamiliar with the story may have trouble following the plot, but can still enjoy the music.

Little Jonas Brother got lost standing next to anybody, and you couldn't hear him unless he was soloing. This is my favorite roll for Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras, it really shows him at his best I feel.

It was also great seeing people from the original 1985 cast at the end.  Colm Wilkinson can still hit and hold that high note at the end of Bring Him Home.  It gives me goosebumps every time.

It is a 25th anniversary celebration at London's O2 facility and all of the music is included;  performers are in costume and the sets are very well done.  Be aware that this is not the ""full Broadway show"", but I was transported while watching the DVD;  one important advantage is that you can view the performers ""close-up"" which reveals the emotion and passion on their faces as they perform.  Alfie Boe is magnificent and is perhaps the consumate Jean Valjean among the four actors who have embraced this role.  The 25th anniversary edition also features all four after the end of the performance and includes other principals who made the Les Miserables stage production possible.  If you are a fan of Les Mis, don't miss this production!",1355097600,,916,4.902597402597403

4383486,2,B004I2K4E8,"Honestly, I'm a new comer to Les Mis. I've never seen the show, and until recently hadn't heard any of the songs. The upcoming release of the movie is what sparked my interest in the show. I listened to other versions via YouTube etc. I rented this version and I'm not all that impressed. There were a few pluses such as Samantha Barks performance as Epinone. I'm looking forward to her performance in the movie, Javarit's performance was quite good I thought. I've heard the 10th anniversary version of Lea Salonga singing Epinone and it was incredible, her Fantine--not so much. My biggest gripe however is Nick Jonas as Marius. Don't get me wrong, I think as a pop star he has some talent, however he doesn't have a strong enough voice to make these songs work. These songs just seem too operatic for Nick's voice.

I'm hoping that the movie changes my ""meh"" feeling towards Les Misrables. I get the feeling that with the right cast singing in the right vocal range and with the right emotion evident in their songs then I would really enjoy the show.",1354665600,,1054,4.576719576719577

Ever since I have loved this musical and I will continue to enjoy it throughout my life. I originally heard this particular performance on PBS and recieved it as a birthday present. The songs have always been fantastic and the 25th aniversary performance has the best symphonic background music I've ever heard; the orchestra was much bigger this time than the 10th.  My only complaint is Nick Jonas. He doesn't do a good job playing Marius at all, however Lea Salonga, Samantha Barks, Alfie Bowe,and Norm Lewis did oustanding jobs as Fantine, Eponine, Valjean, and Javert. Even though some of them didn't look their part, their voices made up for it. Although I prefer the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast, This is an amazing performance and I highly reccomend it.",1354492800,,867,4.741721854304636

4383505,5,B004I2K4E8,"As we speak, it is a month before the movie is due to come out in theaters. I have been waiting for this for close to my entire life and rehashing the DVD is the only thing keeping me going right now. So: this performance was wonderful, pretty much every minute. The performance itself can't really be compared to the 10th Anniversary; it's a different entity. Some pieces were cut, some were added, a few lyrics were changed. The orchestra had a very different sound, most noticeably in Javert's Soliloquy where the melody as carried by the strings seemed to be completely lost. I don't know if that was deliberate or a flaw in the recording. But this is Les Mis, anyway, and it couldn't be bad no matter how hard it tried. The biggest difference between this and 10th is that this one had a set--just one, but used very creatively--and there was some acting, with a few small props, not just people standing at a microphone singing at each other. The overall effect was spellbinding and I did have tears in my eyes a few times (just the opening of ""At the End of the Day"" can do it for me!).
As for the singing:
Alfie Boe, a youngish operatic tenor, was not what we are used to vocally, but in a very nice way. Certainly he has that appropriately noble and saintly look.
 Lea Salonga did well as Fantine, but sounded so different from when she played Eponine--her voice then was so silvery and pristine where now it is richer, more vibrato. I wouldn't say she was better than and worse now, she has just developed in a rather different direction.
Norm Lewis makes Philip Quast look like somebody's kindly old grandpa. His performance is super-intense, disturbed, very human. The down-through-the-floor voice helps.
Enough has been said about poor Nick Jonas. I will add that I didn't think he was that bad. His singing was adequate, except his inability to sustain a note when required, and sometimes (like EC at ET) was better than adequate. It was his frozen pose and expression that were ridiculous. If you like close your eyes or turn off the screen or something it helps.
Katie Hall I thought had the loveliest soprano I have ever heard, sweet and yearning, not shrill for one second ever. I heard she was an understudy? I don't know who they could've had lined up that was better.
Samantha Barks was a showstopper. I'm happy she got the part in the movie. I did find her a tiny bit overpowering and am curious to see how that translates to the screen, especially after having heard Anne Hathaway's very subdued ""I Dreamed a Dream.""
Who am I missing? The Thenardiers were loveably contemptible. Monsieur was considerably slimier than the last one and funnier too. Gavroche was the best I've seen and heard, outrageously cheeky. This kid is like the definition of Hugo's little gamin. There was a woman in the ensemble who I bet was related to him. They had a cute moment.
Other great moments: Fantine walking off literally into the light and turning to watch young Cosette as they cross paths. Enjolras' wordless exchange with Grantaire, hinting at the complicated relationship that till now the musical ignored. Cosette's ""I'm awake..."" And the extras. ""Bring Him Home"" with Colm Wilkinson cannot be described in human terms. The wonderful, adorable and irreplaceable Michael Ball: ""My place is here..."" Throughout the whole segment, I laughed and cried--frequently at the same time--and I wasn't the only one either; the camera stops several times on women in the audience who are smiling from ear to ear with mascara all over their faces.
Would I recommend this? Yeah, I don't know, I have to think about it. Just kidding. Buy it! Buy the 10th Anniversary too. Then buy the Complete Symphonic Recording, just to compare! And the original Broadway soundtrack, just for fun!
And with that I would like to thank Amazon for giving me the chance to yak on and on about one of my favorite subjects, even if no one ever reads this.",1353888000,3,3934,4.6685878962536025
4383506,4,B004I2K4E8,"But still amazing due to the music and the production values.  While Colm Wilkinson will always be THE Jean Valjean for me, I think that Alfie Boe has an astonishing voice and tremendous stage presence.  A few quibbles--while I disagree with whoever said they don't feel that Lea Salonga's voice was powerful enough for the role of Fantine (I thought she was fantastic, as always), I cannot imagine who thought that casting pop star Nick Jonas as Marius was a good idea.  His voice doesn't begin to hold up against the powerhouses around him, which weakens the production sadly--he is simply overshadowed, especially by the actor cast as Enjolras, who blows him away whenever they sing together.  Another weakness--not depicting the battle on the barricades on the overhead screens, which was used to such great effect in the 10th anniversary concert.  And my final quibble--the restaging of the death of Eponine during ""A Little Fall of Rain"", which was far more heartwrenching in the 10th anniversary show.  Still, the show stands on its own--nothing can take away from the power of this haunting score; and the finale, featuring the cast members of the original West End production, will bring tears to anyone who loves this musical.",1353628800,,1236,4.975728155339806

4383511,4,B004I2K4E8,"Les Miserables is my favorite musical ever. I was so glad that they released the 25th Anniversary Concert in Blu-ray. It definitely makes a difference in crisp color and clarity. I was in tears within the first five minutes from Jean Valjean's impassioned singing. The only cast choice that was poor in my opinion was Nick Jonas. For me, Nick Jonas was not up to par in tone, passion, and overall skill to play Marius. But perhaps this was a choice to encourage young (or very young) viewers. Katie Barks did very well as Cosette, but Samantha Barks for me, was not inspiring Eponine. One thing to note, this version is focused on the singing, so there is very little acting with most actors standing in front of microphones for most of the show.
All in all, I would recommend this DVD--the Blu-ray version is definitely worth it and a special treat is seeing some of the older cast members!",1352678400,,891,4.575

I was fortunate to have seen the show on Broadway some time back and this new DVD and the talent represented by the cast is just fabulous.  The quality of the blu-ray DVD and sound is a huge cut above the old VHS version.  What a wonderful show.  It hasn't lost a bit of it's appeal in all these years.  The reunion of former casts at the end along with the creators was a real bonus.  The only way to enjoy this show more is to see it live in New York or London.,1352678400,,604,4.025210084033613

My only reservation is that Nick Jonas does not have a big enough voice for the part of Marius.

Nick Jonas is the only sore spot for me- weak vocals compared to the trained singers. The epilogue and ""Bring Him Home"" always bring tears to my eyes!

I was always a Hunchback of Notre Dame fan but Victor Hugo honestly outdid himself with an amazing story and the composers are pure genius.
Alfie Boe...I love you. I'm a twenty-two year old girl and I am in freaking love with you. YOU ARE AMAZING! Your voice, especially in Bring Him Home/ Bring Me Home was astounding. <3
Evil captain guard guy, I love you too! Your voice was incredible also and I love your songs! Especially when you and Jean sang together. Pure awesomeness on stage.
Fantine, you were my favorite female character. Wooo child do you have some vocals on you. Your voice made me almost cry. It's so beautiful.
Young rebel leader, I loved you too!
Cosette and Epoline, you both were amazing.
Nick Jonas, can't stand your songs normally but you were great in your role.
And everyone else, you all were superb.

4383556,3,B004I2K4E8,"I suppose I consider myself a superfan of the show, and have seen it the most of any musical out there.
That being said, I can't really pick a favorite over-all show, since the performances are so different. I will say that the 25th version has WAY more musical numbers than the 10th and makes more sense of some storylines than before. My argument for the 25th would be to fill in the missing blanks...and I love a good Thernardier couple either way. Props for casting the same lady as Madam Thernardier both times, made that an easy decision for me!

But, with the exception of Lea Salonga as Fantine in the 25th, the 10th just feels more...real to me.
I guess I am partial to the 10th, mostly because of the performers involved. Jean Valjean is a somewhat flexible character vocally...but I love Colm's delivery in some areas better. Who Am I, Bring Him Home, etc. Also a toss-up for Javert (except for his death...Philip Quast gave me the shivers on his last note), Eponine, Cossette, and others. But for me, Michael Ball will forever and always be the voice of Marius, and Nick Jonas just doesn't bring the depth to it. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables doesn't have that raw, suffering emotion to it that Michael Ball gave it in the 10th. He really made you believe he was the only survivor. Nick brings the pop star to the table, and I feel the casting was more for looks than for voice. He can sing the part...just not as dynamically as Michael did.
I am a musician, so naturally I notice music changes as well. I find that the 10th had more dynamic and powerful music, especially during the musical 'call-back' to Bring Him Home, after the battle sequence. For some reason, it just feels more somber and sad. Also I find that One Day More is somehow more electrically charged in the 10th.

Take a risk, get them both and decide for yourself. Now if only there were some way to mash together my favorite numbers from each show...hmm...",1345766400,,1938,4.502840909090909

I love this CD!!!,1341878400,,380,4.521739130434782
4383566,2,B004I2K4E8,"I'm going to try to avoid commenting on the cast/performance because this is really a personal opinion.  Suffice it to say that I own a few versions of Les Mis already, and I liked this one enough to want to buy yet another, and I hardly buy anything. (I own 2 blu rays total, this and the Phantom 25th anniversary performance).  Sadly, the best way to know if you will like a cast is to hear/watch it first.  I had the luxury of watching it on PBS, and aside from Marius I loved it.

Technically, however, this product is a travesty.  Visually, there is a very distracting motion artifact.  Another reviewer has pretty convincingly diagnosed it as a poor transfer from a 24fps source.  It seems like every second or so it's rewinding a fraction of a second, but trying to hide it by morphing from one time frame to the next.  You don't notice it so much when the camera is still and focused on a performer (if you notice at all, you might just think it's a shaky camera), but when it pans across the stage (like in the finale) it is almost headache-inducing.

From an audio perspective, everything on stage sounds far away and tinny, while the crowd is crystal clear and way too loud.  I have to routinely turn up the volume for the performance and turn it back down for the applause. (this is the reason why I'm writing a review, I haven't seen anyone mention this flaw yet) I've done some testing, and at least some of this is because the 5.1 audio mixing is very, very intentionally terrible.  All the voices and 99% of the orchestra are in the front 3 speakers.  Meanwhile the surround speakers are literally 99% useless noise and a few randomly chosen instruments or moments from the orchestra.  I say useless noise because the surround speakers are almost exclusively playing a cavernous echo that makes everything sound far away and tinny.  That's right, they did it on purpose.  People don't buy home videos so that they can fantasize about sitting in the cheap seats, guys.  The surround speakers also carry the amplified crowd noise that I have to mute after every song.  As far as the ""random bits of orchestra"", let's take the ""Look Down"" prologue as an example.  Aside from the cavernous echo there is nothing that comes out of the surround speakers, except for the guitar riff between verses.  What?  Why?  And how hard did they have to try to do something so useless?  2.0 audio sounds better, which doesn't seem like it should be a valid compliment (they successfully remix the random bits of orchestra back in from the surround speakers, without adding the cavern or the extra crowd).  I'm not sure if it gets rid of all the ""tinny"" qualities yet, but it definitely helps a lot.

While reading the reviews here, what struck me as really odd was the criticism of Lea Salonga, and specifically that her voice was weak -- of the Eponines and Fantines from the 3 casts I own (Broadway, 10th, and now 25th), I'd say Lea's is ""strongest"" in the sense that she has the best projection (which is what I think people mean by ""weak"" vs ""strong"" or ""powerful"").  I said I wouldn't talk too much about cast opinions, but I think the technical inferiority of this product might be partially shaping people's opinions of this performance.  I think the hollow quality of the disc's audio is hitting Fantine's role harder than most.  Just throwing that out there.

I dug up my old DVR that has the PBS recording (digital 1080i) of this performance for comparison.  Off the bat, there is no reverse morphing effect in the video, which is a huge plus.  I think there are some re-compression artifacts from being broadcast, but that is small potatoes compared to the morphing.  Out of the box, the PBS broadcast sounds better than the blu ray 5.1 because there's no cavern effect, but PBS or my DVR did something odd to the channels.  I'm not getting surround left/right at all, and front left/right seem to be duplicated to rear left/right.  So there's no cavern or loud crowd, but then whatever random orchestral bits they put in surround left/right is lost (e.g., I don't hear the guitar riff in the prologue as described above).  Like I said earlier, I still haven't entirely decided if blu ray 2.0 audio fully gets rid of the empty quality of the recording.  That's probably the tiebreaker between whether I think PBS audio or blu ray 2.0 is superior (I know I've been satisfied with the audio spectrum of PBS, but now I also know that it's missing some unknown portion of the orchestra).

Sadly, I can't think of another way to own the 25th anniversary performance, which I very much would like to have.  That's the only reason why I'm not giving 1 star to the product, because there is no other option (the 2010 cast recording is not the same thing).",1341705600,6,4756,4.572609208972845

As for the DVD.... I LOVE Alfie and Ramin. It is because of these 2 gentlemen that I purchased this.  They are AWESOME!

As for Nick Jonas... I hate to complain, but he ruined the part of Marius for me.  He just doesn't have the power or the voice to pull it off.  And he is always staring into the lights.  The other actors try to interact with him, but he just keeps staring into the spotlights.  (He also looks like he wants to cry all the time) Oh well.

Like I said earlier though, Alfie is perfect as Valjean and his singing just carries you to another place.",1341532800,,684,4.113636363636363

This was very well done musically and the staging was quite dramatic given that the cast were standing at mics for the most part. It was captured brilliantly on the recording.

A bonus at the end were reprises of a couple of the show-stoppers with several UK companies and many members of the original 1985 company joining in.

Of course Cameron Mackintosh banked this one as well but the production was really well done. Must have been magical to be there that night.

Highly recommended.",1341532800,,577,4.74
4383569,4,B004I2K4E8,"I'm not a fan of the show-concert format, which is rather stiff compared to a regular performance.

But that's the nature of the format, and this just about as good as it can get. The presentation is a bit bombastic with the full symphony orchestra and large chorus, but it's well done overall, with excellent performances from almost the entire cast. Special recognition goes to Alfie Boe, who is astounding as Jean Valjean.

The major weak link, of course, is Nick Jonas, who is way out of his depth here in vocal and acting talent. This was clearly stunt casting for a role which would have been far better in the hands of any of the actors playing small supporting roles on that stage. I doubt seriously that Jonas' appearance made the slightest difference in attendance, and that makes it a wasted opportunity for such a grand production.

I was also disappointed with Lea Salonga. Please hear me out. Salonga has a great set of pipes and gobs of talent for the musical stage, but she sings ""I Dreamed a Dream"" for the rafters, and while that is an admirable talent, I don't think it suits the song. It's a song of disillusionment and resignation, and to my ear it calls for a softer touch than Salonga gave it.

Still, I recommend this disc for a performance which, on the whole, is polished and well executed, and for the added attraction of the post-show songs and presentations.",1341532800,,1387,4.603238866396761

4383573,3,B004I2K4E8,"As I'm sure gazillion other reviewers have already mentioned, this would've been a great, great performance had it not been for that one glaring weakness that is Nick Jonas.

Les Miserables is one of my all-time favorite musicals, and I've watched it many times in different parts of the world.  I was SO ready to love this performance, especially since Alfie Boe has an unbelievable voice!  To me, Colm Wilkinson will forever be THE one and only Jean Valjean, but Boe comes pretty dang close.  It's not only the voice; he is extremely charismatic and can convey much with his eyes alone.

Actually, the cast is overall great -- except Nick Jonas as Marius.  I have nothing against him personally, but he is so out of his league here that it's painful to watch (and to listen).  After trying to find something good in his performance several times, I just gave up and now fast forward every time he sings (which means anything after Look Down is shot).  It is truly annoying to be able to enjoy such beautiful songs as Red and Black, Do You Hear the People Sing, and Drink with Me only 75% of the way through.  I haven't a clue what the casting director was thinking!

Of course, if you tolerate the Jonas Brother and make it to the end, you will be rewarded by a lovely finale.  Not one, not two, not three, but FOUR Jean Valjeans (including THE Colm Wilkinson)sing Bring Him Home -- absolutely breathtaking.  And then, the original London cast appears and they sing One Day More.  Yes, Michael Ball is Marius.  He shows the world how it's done.  It feels as if order has been restored in the world.

Even though this concert is more elaborate and has some stronger singers, I prefer the 10th Anniversary Concert(TAC) to  this because TAC, after all, has no obvious weak link in the cast, which allows me to watch the entire show without having to touch the remote.  Whoever cast Nick Jonas should never be allowed to work in musical theater ever again.  And I'd say release the TAC on Blu-ray and get it over and done with.  That's the one you want to own and watch over and over again.",1341014400,,2088,4.4880636604774535

4383579,5,B004I2K4E8,"LES MISERABLES 25th Anniversay Concert is beautifully done and a lovely rendition of this musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's incomparable novel.  Though the staging of this new version has been revised from the 1995 concert version, and the cast is not as widely known, yet, (except for Lea Salonga, imho) as the stellar 1995 Concert Performance, this is still a magnificent and glorious performance, always deeply touching and heart-wrenching.  The singer/actors are superb: Alfie Boe, Lea Salonga, Jenny Galloway, Norm Lewis, Samantha Jane Barks, Ramin Karimloo, and a surprisingly sweet and warm performance as ""Marius"" by pop singer Nick Jonas.  LES MISERABLES is a stunning, extraordinary musical, my personal all time best-loved favorite, and that by far, since the 1980s. This 25th Anniversary production is, hands-down, far and away THE FINEST performance of Les Miserables that I have ever seen in my life, whether on stage or a concert version, and it is well-worth having in your DVD library and I might add, well-worth watching as often as you can.  The spirit always needs a re-ennobling from time to time, and this beautiful story always accomplishes that.
LES MIS' is the most intense, yet tender, loving, merciful and, in the end, uplifting musical ever composed for the stage. A metaphor for the victory of God's Mercy over Justice (yet not in conflict with real justice, of the Redemption of sinners triumphing, instead of their destruction.  It is the story of a man who, by Divine Aid (grace) goes from being a vengeful and hate-filled man, to a living saint whose heart and mercy and kindness are as immense, as his humility is profound.  LES MIS' is every bit as monumental, as a theatre-piece, as is Victor Hugo's novel as a literary work.  It simply, far and away, has no equal in the musical theatre, and I believe that it never will.  LES MISERABLES is, truly, incomparable.  When the good souls from heaven (the Garden of the Lord) sing the saintly Valjean into the Kingdom at the end, the crusade that they are calling you and I to join is not one of politics, bombs, or armed revolts or Political Parties or ideologies, but rather one of reverence and of mercy, kindness, forgiveness, compassion and generosity for each other that has never been heard of, or equalled before, in this Life. This play is gentle, touching, charming, painful at times, and warm. It openly advocates faith, repentance, self-sacrifice for others's sakes, it advocates decency, goodness, and kindness; it promotes cleansed and generous hearts. As Victor Hugo put it, regime changes are never enough: HEARTS MUST CHANGE.  That is a ""crusade"" well worth joining:  Tomorrow, Come!!",1339286400,,2685,5.024774774774775

Young Cossette is a heart-breaker. The addition of a very large supporting chorus only enhances the overall concert.

Then I read the other reviews that it was Nick Jonas. Clearly the producers went with flashy casting instead getting a solid anchor.

Bummer. I wish I could insert a younger Michael Ball in the role. He was outstanding in the 10th anniversary version.

However, this Cosette is miles better than the 10th anniversary one.

In general, this cast is more age-appropriate than the 10th anniversary, though I think the vocal talent was generally better in the 10th.

4383590,4,B004I2K4E8,"Most of what needs said has been said.  There are a few points that need driven home.

1. Alfie Boe is a ""singers"" Jean Valjean.  No, he doesn't have a character voice like Colm.  But wow... this guy has chops and he delivers with so much heart.  To not love him suggests you're maybe too sentimental about Colm.

2. Jonas as Marius is every bit as awful as everyone says.  I simply can't excuse this casting.  I can't believe, during dress rehersals, Jonas himself didn't say, ""Wow, am I outmatched here.  Better for everyone if I move to the chorus.""  He's a community theater voice at best.  That, and the lacking stage presence, looks, and acting ability make his performance uncomfortable to watch.  It really is staggering.

My wife and I have been fans since the 80's.  We were both riveted to this performance.  Everyone is so good that we happily suffered through Jonas to hear the others.",1332115200,,898,4.594936708860759

I saw this for the first time on PBS while waiting in the emergency room to be treated for acute bronchitis, and I couldn't help but sing along to the numbers as I watched it. And even though I was in respiratory distress, I still had more breath support than Nick Jonas.  However, while a lot of people are ripping on Nick for being an awkward and disappointing addition to the cast, he does not ruin the production for me. He does lack some stage presence among the other actors who play the students, and certainly his vocal style does not blend well among the ensemble, but he is truly not horrible. He's just a pop vocalist, not a musical theater performer.

I cried several times during the production, and found myself rewatching it almost constantly for a week. It was a wonderful tribute to the musical, and well worth the purchase.

A small warning: this is a concert performance. As I've not seen the actual play, I can't say what dialogue or songs may be missing, but the acting in this performance is minimal - the cast stand at microphones throughout the concert. It was not intended to be a full performance. That said, it was a great introduction to the musical for me - I had no problem keeping up with the plot despite only having been acquainted with the storyline in the loosest sense of the word.",1331164800,,963,4.566473988439307

The concert was done in what seemed to be a football stadium, complete with screaming fans who yelled and applauded over most of the orchestral passages.  Each of the ""singers"" were equiped with microphones in which each screamed for the entire evening.  Not all the singers were vocally good enough to merit all that amplification.  There is no balance between vocal parts and the orchestra.  The performers stand in place sreaming while the orchestra can't be heard.  This has been a lesson to me.

It let me down in many layers... First the director has chosen to take nearly every song at a blistering speed.  Not only is it unpleasant to hear, but the vocalists are ""singing"" so fast they can barely get the words out.  This leads me to the next problem where the singers aren't singing as much as they are shouting quickly.  There are a couple exceptions - the Bishop, Fontine (did well in solo but nothing else), the Innkeeper, and maybe a couple others.  Out of a cast of probably 60 plus a choir, that's pretty sad.  Also, they've cut chunks out of songs.  It doesn't feel like any of these people or directors have actually played any of these characters on stage.  It feels like someone plopped them in front of a mic.

If you like this musical do not get this!  I am currently hunting for the older one.  Sorry to have to leave an unpleasant review.",1330214400,3,1065,4.166666666666667
4383600,3,B004I2K4E8,"Having been a fan for many years of the original & the tenth anniversary dream cast edition, I was EXCITED to know this production was a reality.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in all respects.  Initially the PBS airing here in the US was not as exciting as I had hoped.  Thinking the TV didn't do it justice, I purchased the DVD.  I was equally as disappointed.  As my title states, I think the performances , overall, lack the passion and depth of the tenth anniverary performances.  The more modern staging does NOT make up for the less than stellar performances of the cast.  Lea Solonga and the Thenendieres are the performances that bring back the emotions.  Samantha Banks as Eponine was beautiful in the role but I sure did not feel the ""undying"" passion of the character.  Nick Jonas is so lackluster in the very passionate role of Marius that I might understand the absence of passion from Eponine. The performance of ""EMPTY CHAIRS AT EMPTY TABLES"" lacks the suffering and angst that Michael Ball so passionately provides in every rendition.  Am I sorry I purchased this DVD? NO.  Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are very good with beautiful voices.  Phillip Quast is an extremely hard act to follow as Gebert.
Thank you for this opportunity to voice my opinion.  I think the original cast was so outstanding that any subsequent cast might pale in comparison, but this is an emotional musical and ANY performance should reflect that passion.",1329955200,,1448,4.767068273092369
4383601,5,B004I2K4E8,"I just keep replaying this, wearing my headset and listening to it over and over. It's amazing.

*** YOU MIGHT WANT TO SKIP THIS RANT ***

Long story short on how I learned about this amazing show (He's lying, it's still kind of long).

I heard all the talk a while ago about Susan Boyle singing a song ""I dreamed a dream"" on the X-factor. I Love to Hate Simon Cowell so I had to go see what he's up to and to listen to this song. I was blown away by the song and Susan Boyle's voice, listening to it over and over. Then I decided to go see what this ""Les Miserables"" was.

I looked it up and still didn't think much about it, but one night I saw it was going to be on PBS and decided to record it. Days, maybe weeks later, I was bored and as I flipped through my recordings and saw Les Miserables. I saw the recording time, and it seemed really long. I didn't know if I wanted to invest that much time into this thing I really had never heard of. Well, I decided to play this ""Les Miserables"" recording, thinking I'd probably hate it and end up just skipping through to see the song Susan Boyle sung, then deleting it.

WOW, I was so wrong. I watched it non-stop, and then watched it again.  I must have watched it 5 times now and listened to it 50 times over the past few months.

I am still amazed at how I went through life without even knowing about this, never mind not seeing it. I would always bring my daughters to new shows or other forms of art as they grew up, but for some reason I totally missed this over the last 26 years.

I have to thank Simon Cowell, Susan Boyle and PBS for eventually leading me to this show. I even donated to PBS for bringing me this (AND Celtic Women).

I have been repeatedly watching my PBS recording of the 25th anniversary version and got tired of the breaks and donation requests (I donated already, geesh), so I ordered this. I also ordered the 10th anniversary edition AND the standard DVD version. My daughters with each get one and I'll keep one to replay one over and over.

*** END RANT ***

Overall, I think the cast was amazing. It was so good that I wanted to do some research just to see who all these amazing people were. Nick did seem to have some tough spots, but he wasn't THAT bad. However, he was a bit overshadowed by the rest of the amazing cast. Lea Salonga and Katie Hall were good. Jenny Galloway, Matt Lucas and Ramin Karimloo were amazing. Even the younger actors Mia Jenkins and Robert Madge did an amazing job, and on such a big stage.

I REALLY enjoyed Norm Lewis and Alfie Bow - all I can say is WOW. But Samantha Banks was WICKED amazing. With all three of these actors, their amazing voices along with their mannerisms and facial expressions really made you *feel* what they were going through, and you could really sympathize with them.

I am SO glad Ms. Banks got that part in the upcoming movie. I can NOT wait to see that.

If you go through life without seeing this, you will have missed something REALLY special. I almost did. Thank gawd I love to hate Simon Cowell...",1329696000,4,3048,4.2058319039451115

Also Alfie Boe is a great singer, but the guy needs to take a lesson from Colm Wilkinson and learn when to use a little dynamics and not always sing the big stuff as BIG and as operetic as he does.

IMO the 10th anniversary is far and above a much better show when it comes to the quality of singers.  The one singer that really stands out is Samantha Barks as Eponine.  Fantastic.

4383610,5,B004I2K4E8,"""Les Miserables"" is one of the greatest novels ever ritten.  In addition, its musical counterpart stands as an example of one of the greatest theater productions ever to be created.  Exploring such universal themes as love, law versus grace, and sacrifice, the show contains beautiful characters and unforgettable music.

This story is set against the backdrop of the French Revolution.  Jean Valjean is a convict who has just been released after a nineteen-year prison sentence for stealing a loaf of bread.  He is given his ""yellow ticket of leave,"" which marks him as a criminal, and which he must present everywhere he goes.  After receiving unexpected kindness from a bishop he robs, Jean Valjean makes the decision to break his parole and start a new life.  However, his decision incurs relentless pursuit from the stern yet, ultimately, tormented Inspector Javert.  Jean Valjean will be forced on a journey in which he'll meet unforgettable characters and make momentous decisions that will effect many lives.

This 25th anniversary concert is a true delight from start to finish.  I was particularly mesmerized by Alfie Boe, who brings a tenderness to the role of Jean Valjean.  Although Colm Wilkinson is truly delightful, it is nice to hear a different voice: one that fairly soars with beauty.  Norm Lewis, who portrays Inspector Javert, is truly stunning.  He brings anger, sadness and a steadfast determination to his role.  Javert is one of my favorite characters, and Mr. Lewis truly emphasizes the police inspector's conflicted emotions and unwillingness to submit to the grace that is offered him.  Eponine, my absolute favorite character of the show, is wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Barks.  Her tender voice throbs with pain for her unrequited love for Marius, and her sacrificial actions shine through.  Lea Salonga is perfect as Fantine, the mother who will resort to any means to save her child from cunning and ruthless caregivers.  The other cast members are equally wonderful.
Regarding those who are giving Mr. Nick Jonas, (the pop star who portrays Marius), such a hard time: I honestly thought he did very well.  He is not trained in musical theater, yet his emotions are clear.  Jonas obviously tries very hard and loves the material.

Please give this wonderful production a chance.  God bless you all.",1327536000,2,2336,5.108179419525066

Loved the international rendition of Bring Him Home on the 10th. Truly enjoyed the quartet and the 10th anniversary cast songs at the end of the 25th.

Although I would have loved for this performance to include more acting I feel as though this allows the cast to highlight their musical talents and forces them to be more expressive with their faces.

He sang beautifully, and was well into character. Definitely not the Disney stereotype at all, which is what I expected.  My respect grew even more when I found out that he always wanted to play Marius. It was a decent performance.
The cast and ensemble were incredible. Javert was amazing along with Jean Vajean (of course!). I was speechless at the end---this was beyond words the best thing I have ever seen.

Once more, travesty - Joel Schumacher does the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera.  But was followed by the 25th Anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera Royal Albert Hall.  Bravo.  Browsing through Amazon, I saw this 25th Anniversary Edition of Les Miserable and was about to ignore all negative review, but curiosity overcame.  I saw Nick Jonas as Marius.  My jaw dropped.

The singing is augmented by a fantastic full orchestra and a huge choir. This you definitely will not get in the theater. Also, at the end there is an encore of sorts with performers from the original casts, and a troupe of young people who put on a production of Les Mis in London (as the future of Les Mis).

4383634,3,B004I2K4E8,"Many of the reviews have already gone over the casting and performances in this concert, so my review will concentrate SOLELY on the motion artifacts inherent in this BluRay.

Though I haven't read all the reviews on Amazon for Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert Blu Ray, I haven't seen anyone mentioning the odd (and to me, very distracting) video motion artifacts in this BluRay presentation.

There is a motion artifact that severely blurs the image (most obvious with movement) at regular intervals throughout this BluRay. It occurs at regular periodic intervals of approximately 1/3 - 1/2 of a second. Most of the time, the video quality is quite pristine with good clarity and sharpness, especially in close-ups and when the performers are relatively still/stationary. Unfortunately, there are lots of panning shots in this production, and of course, the performers aren't completely stationary. When there is movement, the motion artifacts are noticeable and it blurs the image so much as to present a doubled image.

After reviewing it again and again, I've determined that the artifact is not caused by the display chain but is inherent in the BluRay. To dispel any doubts, my display chain accepts and displays 1080/24p, and has no problems with any of the other 100+ 24p BluRays in my collection. The motion artifact is not caused by the display chain. A simple test to determine that it is not an artifact of telecine 3:2 pulldown judder in the display chain (as from a display chain incapable of reproducing 1080/24p)is to pause the movie and advance it frame-by-frame.

I can see the image go from clear and sharp frames as I advance frame-by-frame, to blurry and doubled at the exact same specific frames in paused images, and it's possible to see the transition in panning shots, going from clear (with only the normal very slight inherent blurring due to the exposure times) to the double imaged, blurry mess at regular intervals as I advance frame-by-frame. Obviously, the sharper and larger the display, the more obvious these artifacts are.

One of the scenes in which this can be seen quite obviously is at 45:00 during 'Master Of The House'. Beginning exactly at that time, there is a panning shot centered on Thenardier. Because he is centered in the shot, the motion artifacts are not as immediately obvious on him, however I can see them quite obviously on the performers sitting on the benches in the background to the left of him on the screen. Watch them as the camera pans past him and you can see the people on the bench blur into doubled images at regular intervals of about 1/2 a second.

Unfortunately, the motion artifacts are not restricted solely to the background. Another example is in the scene where the bishop has just given Jean Valjean the candlesticks, as the camera pans up Valjean, he blurs visibly three times in the short time it takes to pan up from his waist to his face.

It appears to be some sort of conversion artifact. It would appear that Soho Transfer (the company that converted the footage from the HD master to 24p) is responsible for this screw up.

I just thought it might help some folks considering this purchase to avoid disappointment by being aware of this ahead of time. The music of Les Miserables is of course, one of the main draws and reasons for purchasing this, but if it were the sole reason, I could have just stuck with the soundtrack on CD (not considering the differences in audio quality between CD and BluRay formats).",1322784000,4,3509,4.826955074875208

I first fell in love with this musical, and musical theater, when I saw a school production of the show some 6 years ago.  The flaws in this show were that certain scenes were cut and replaced with a filmed sequence.  This would leave first time watchers a bit confused as they could not piece together what happened.  Also I felt that the death exits could have been done better than people just walking off stage.  Otherwise the casting was impeccable.

The cast of 1995's special truly was the ""dream"" cast and with reason. Colm Wilkinson is without a doubt the best ValJean in the show's history, his chemistry with Phillip Quast is unmatched. It was so great to see Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway back as ""the T's"" though. Many slammed their performance from 95 but I found it most enjoyable, providing the comic relief these characters are. Lea Salonga, what can I say? First off, I LOVE Lea, but to cast her as Fantine was a bad call. Lea is without a doubt most the most well known and the best Eponine and to take her away from that role, I just don't know. Ruthie Henshall is the best Fantine (sorry to the Patti LuPone fans). And now to Nick Jonas, were producers thinking this was the only way they could sell tickets? Yes he looks the part of Marius but he can't hold a candle to Michael Ball (""Empty Chairs"" is a prime example). Again, I don't know what the motives were there.
While I don't own this, I felt as a fan of the show I had to review it. You are much better off getting the 10th Anniversary concert from Royal Albert!",1317513600,2,1246,4.283898305084746
4383648,4,B004I2K4E8,"I saw this DVD as a premium on my PBS station, but did not want to contribute a couple of hundred to get it. Very different from the 10th anniversary performance where everyone was on stage, actors came and went through a central passage. Some of the material was changed to incorporate more of the dialogue and this is good. The staging and lighting is dramatic and adds to the experience, and this had to be especially so for those in attendance. Cossette from the 10th anniversary is not Fontaine, but everyone else is new. The voices were good, especially when considering some of the casting decisions were based on current pop popularity. In many ways, I still prefer the 10th anniversary over this one, but probably because I have such a history with it - having watched it countless times, and listened to the CD even more.

There is a 25th anniversary CD - it is NOT the same cast/cutting you will find on the DVD, and while good, the voices do not come across as strong.

Universal is making a movie of Les Mis and produced this DVD. Shame on them!!!!!!!  One-star for packaging. There is the box, the cover and the CD - and nothing else. Not even an insert listing the cast, or order of songs. Nada. This is not a budget-priced DVD and Universal could certainly have covered the cost of a single page insert. For anyone using this as an introduction to the musical or the book, there is nothing here to tell you what is happening.

While his voice may not be as strong as most stage performers, his acting was great and surely made up for it. Samantha Bark's voice was absolutely perfect for Eponine- arguably the best Eponine I've heard.

I concur with fellow reviewer Philip Wells who wrote, ""Nick Jonas is a complete distraction in this show. His Marius has none of the depth that previous performers have given that role."" I could not agree him with more.  Pop star Jonas Brother Nick singlehandedly ruined the 25th anniversary performance. His voice was embarrassing as was his delicate, almost hesitant, overall performance. I also agree with Philip Wells who mentioned that when they finally brought out the 1985 cast, Colm Wilkinson he triumphed.  His voice was so astounding singing Bring Him Home that, although the three other Jean Valjeans sang too, it was Colm Wilkinson's song alone right up until the last pure high note which only Wilkinson could achieve and hold perfectly for so long. The greatest strength of the 25th Anniversary Cast was  Norm Lewis as Javert. Lewis' immense strength, expression, intensity, posture and clarity of voice made it clear Norm Lewis is the epitome of the conflicted Inspector Javert. While the greatest Jean Valjean will always be Colm Wilkinson,  Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean gave an exceedingly strong performance despite looking a bit young; but then he wasn't in charge of make-up so he cannot be blamed for that. His presence, expressions, and above all, voice made him a great choice for the 25th Anniversary Concert.

Robert Madge as Gavroche is outstanding! Such energy, such talent, such adorable smirks! (too Bad ""Little People"" and Gavroche's brief death scene were omitted.) Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras made a great heartthrob but it was the commitment in his powerful voice that made him the premier student rebel leader. Karimloo was clearly a ideal casting choice.

Finally, the lighting in this production was the most outstanding innovation; it being so effective that it gave the show a great dramatic effect only seen the stage version (and hopefully will be seen in the promised film.)

I know there are a lot of Les Mis experts out there, but in my own humble opinion, the performances, the songs, the whole experience was what made me buy it after actually renting it.  I needed to see it again.  I was in tears at the end.  Beautiful rendition, and I do have to admit that I laughed myself when I heard Nick Jonas was cast, but I (and this, again, is just me), thought he did a fine job.

4383655,2,B004I2K4E8,"I accept that I am a biased fan. I've listened to a variety of Les Mis recordings and have seen a few different productions but I have never found anything to be on par with the Tenth Anniversay Concert--titled by fans the, ""Dream Cast"". At first, I accepted nothing but that monumental concert, and it greatly inhibited my ability to enjoy other renditions and interpritations. Over the years however, I have learned not to compare everything to the TAC--it's not fair to myself, and it is ultimately unfair to the show, which is still strong today. To anchor it down to a past performance would be wrong, and while I will always use TAC as a basis for comparison, I am now more readily able to take a good show for what it's worth and just accept that nothing will top the mental shrine i've built around the TAC. Naturally, I had high hopes for the 25th concert. Unfortunately, after having watched it a few times and after having contemplated it for a while, I feel as though my expectations were let down. Now, I won't completely degrade this show--there are some performances that are really fantastic--but as a whole, It just doesn't work. But before I delve into the bad, let me highlight the good:

-Alfie Boe. Wilkinson still remains the quintisential Valjean in my mind and his interpritation of the character will never be matched. However, I can appreciate when a good thing comes along, and Boe is more than a good thing: he's fantastic. His operatic voice gives him an edge over some past Valjeans(Wilkinson excluded), and his interpritation of Valjean was so different from Colm's that comparing them seems silly. Boe's Valjean is subdued and humble, and his performance is more subtle. This is a stark constrast to Wilkinson's Valjean, who is vocal and exhuberant without being overworked. In ""Bring him Home"", Boe adresses God with humility and without presumption, keeping his composure until the last few moments of the song. Wilkinson's legendary performance of the same song paints a very different portrait: his his outright pleading with God, perhaps seconds away from falling to his knees and begging to save this boy(even if that means that he will have to learn to let his daughter go). What I love about these two is that both paint a believeable character and unlike some other Valjeans, Boe's Valjean is not an attempt at carbon copying the original, which in turn makes his performances very interesting to watch. Colm is still Valjean, but Boe really did a comendable job with this role.
-Ramin Karimloo. It probably goes without saying, but Ramin is fantastic in this show. He brings all of the raw intensity to Enjolras without being too loud or forceful.
-Jenny Galloway. This woman is not praised enough. I was overjoyed to see her, the one and only Mrs. Thenardier in my mind. She hasn't lost a thing, and she really helped carry the show along.
-Lea Salonga. I have mixed opinions about her performance here, which came as a surprise to me because I'm really a big fan of hers. Her performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in this concert was just too heavy handed to my ears. It was too forced, too loud, and without the subtle intricacies I've heard her handle this song with in different recordings. Her rendition of ""Come to Me"" however was superbly done, as was her preformance in the ""Epilouge"".
-The 1985 cast reunion. It was nice to see the old pros together again, and I'm amazed at how well some of their voices have aged.
-The Valjean Quartet. Wilkinson made this song. At 67 years old, he was still the most easily distinguishable voice amongst the bunch, with his wonderfully expressive voice. Obviously, his voice isn't as strong as it was. But darn it all if he doesn't sound amazing for his age. It was nicely arranged too, though at times all four voices could be a little over whelming(I think JoJ and Barrowman should have pulled back a bit--they almost sounded like they were shouting).

Now for the ""half-empty"" part.

-Norm Lewis. I know, I know--some people will curse and shout at me for this. However, I was really dissapointed in Lewis's performance in this concert. I mean, I know the guy can sing. He's done brilliant work in Sweeney Todd and in ""Sondheim on Sondheim"". He even rocked ""The Little Mermaid"". But as Javert, Lewis just doesn't work. He shouts more than he sings, and it really seemed like Sweeney Todd playing Javert. The character of Javert is perhaps my favorite in all of Les Mis. During the musical, we're supposed to see this character evolve, going from a seemingly apathetic military man to a conflicted soul. There needs to be a progession during all the numbers where we see this change coming about, and Lewis just didn't do this. He was ""on"" all the time, and I thought he was going to pop a vein in ""The Confrontation"". I like Lewis, but I don't like Lewis in this. I will say to his credit, the musical accompaniment hindered him during some numbers. Which brings me to my next point:
-Musical arrangment and orchestra. It was really off during this show. Sometimes the singer's mikes were too loud and overwhelmed the music, and sometimes the music was too fast or choppy. The music needs to support the voices of the singers, not hinder them. It's sad that for the 25th anniversary of this monumental show that the musical accompaniment wasn't better directed.
-""One Day More"". This is a troublesome song to begin with. If the finale of the number isn't done properly, it sounds like a horrendous cacaphony of mismatched voices. ""One Day More"" in this show unfortunately fell into this trap. The beauty of this number has always been that, despite singing different verses, all of the singers somehow blend together. In this show, it was conspiculously obvious that several lyrics were being tossed around and it was dizzying.
-Nick Jonas. I won't hate on Nick Jonas, becasue he was actual better than I expected him to be. I will however hate on the casting director in charge of putting together the singers for this concert. Nick Jonas is often defended as ""singing well for his age"" and ""doing the best he could with what he had"". Both of these are absolutely true. However, for a 25th anniversary, you can't cast someone in a main role who ""does the best with their limited voice"" or ""sings well for being a pop star"". The poor kid was terribly outmatched on stage and, while he carried himself through to the best of his abilities, it really hurt the overall production. At times he overacts his character, no doubt trying to make-up for the limits of his voice with a moving performance. Unfortunately, it was so obivously overdone that it just didn't work. The kid isn't a horrendous singer--infact, I think he is a great deal better than any of us familiar with his Jonas Brother's work thought. But ""being better than bad"" isn't good enough for what is perhaps the best musical of all time.
-So-so rest of the cast. Samantha Barks wasn't bad, wasn't fantastic. The most mermorable things about her performance is her bizzar phrasing in ""On My Own"", a number she overacted in parts where she should have brought her voice back and underacted in parts where she should have given more. The girl can act with her face, but she has yet to master acting with her voice. She's young, and understandably she's not going to be a pro like Lea Salonga. So she was okay, but not great, and I don't she was 25th anniversary great. Similarily, Katie Hall is okay but not great. When discussing this with people who have a more positive opinion of this production, the number one phrase I hear tossed around is, ""good for their age"". Yes, Nick Jonas, Samantha Barks, and Katie Hall are all good for their age and yes, there ages are close to the ages of the characters they portray. But in a musical, skill takes precendent over matchign ages. All three of these singers are okay, but nowhere near skilled enough with their acting and vocal techniques to justify their casting in this production.

So overall, this was a ""meh"" attempt at what should have been a tribute to one of the greatest musical ever written. There were highs and lows, and unfortunately they didn't balance eachother out.",1315785600,18,8179,4.697560975609756
4383656,5,B004I2K4E8,"i love, love, love this dvd!!! i saw it recently on public tv and was thrilled to find it on amazon. i am a huge fan of les miz and saw the traveling production 3times when it came to my city. the voices in this rendition are all outstanding...with the notable exception of nick jonas, who just seems out of place and too weak to be in the company of the other much stronger voices and more experienced actors. i can't imagine how this casting decision got made!! another great feature of this dvd comes at the end, when the former jean valjeans come onstage and sing together...thrilling! everybody connected to this production shows such obvious love and joy for it...and that is quite contagious. i look forward to many future viewings.",1315785600,,739,4.606060606060606
4383657,3,B004I2K4E8,"As most others here have said, Nick Jonas is really lackluster in this production. (I read that his father had a lot to do with getting him on board this version - good connections will always make the world go `round). I would say that there's much to appreciate in the clarity of the image and sound, but the overall emotional impact is not quite as thrilling as the 10th Anniversary production. Besides Jonas being miscast, you have a very (supposed to be) `funny' Thenardier, as apparently Matt Lucas is some sort of `famous' British comedian, though I just didn't get his take on the part - completely the wrong guy. (Please compare Alun Armstrong's version in the 10th Anniversary to see what I mean.)

I was also excited to hear about the planned movie of the musical, wondering who would appear in the cast. You would hope after all the comments here, Cameron Mackintosh would hold his ground. If you've seen the wonderful `Stage By Stage' version that came out just 3 years after Les Miserables opened in London, you will see footage from what I am guessing was an earlier attempt to film the original British cast for a movie version. They obviously decided that this approach was not going to work (for whatever reason)...but I personally enjoy seeing it quite a bit, and I think it would have worked even better with a live audience, warts and all if that be the problem.

Anyway, disappointed as I was to see my favorite musical `downgraded' because of the 25th Anniversary performances of Marius and Thenardier, I am now wondering if, as with Nick Jonas, Cameron is just settling for less, just to get the darn movie financed and done. The Hollywood types are putting on the pressure for more popular names, with the announcement of Hugh Jackman starring as Jean Valjean.  I know he has a decent voice (much, much more so than the Jonas kid) and appeared in several London West End productions (you can hear him sing ""Oh What A beautiful Mornin'"" here [...]), but I'm uncertain about how he will handle the Valjean part. Given the way things are done in Hollywood, I am not too optimistic for the rest of the casting - look at the disasters of Madonna as Evita (but she financed it, so what could you say?) or Gerard Butler in `Phantom of the Opera' (a quote from Entertainment Weekly said, ""Prior to his audition, Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing ""The Music of the Night"" for Lloyd Webber.""). There's a lot going on behind the scenes to get these big projects green lighted, and I'm not surprised...just hoping that Cameron could assert more control than apparently he is able.",1315353600,7,2658,4.6752136752136755
4383658,4,B004I2K4E8,"Overall I liked the recording.  The performances are really good.  I fell in the trap of trying to compare to some of the original Les Miserables recordings.  I remember that I like the Gary Morris recording over Colm Wilkinson.

Initially I though that Nick Jonas performance was so so.  I do not think it was as charismatic as some of the other parts.
I certainly like the other earlier recordings such as the Complete Symphonic recording better. There were some places where it
seemed that Nick Jonas Struggled a bit.  I some of the performance had a little more character or expression.  I think Nick Jonas needs to develop the Vocal Range of his voice a little.
There was a place where he really struggled going for  some of the lower notes.",1315353600,,746,4.598484848484849

My only gripe is that such a relatively costly DVD (I paid $20) was so ""bargain basement"" in extras - no liner notes, no ""the making of,"" no ""behind the scenes.""  I expect bare-bones in a $5 or $10 DVD, but not $20 (hence four rather than five stars.)  However, the quality of the concert makes such gripes seem trivial.",1314576000,,624,4.535714285714286

Everyone was phenomenal..with the exception of Nick Jonas. I have to say was quite disappointed with his performance as he didn't have the depth of voice for the roll and after hearing everyone else, found he was lacking.

4383677,5,B004I2K4E8,"I don't feel it necessary to comment on this production as it has already been done so very eloquently (and not so) many times over already here.  Suffice to say I concur with the majority... a splendid production in every way!!! I'm so thankful I had the good fortune to catch it on the big screen and now own the blu-ray to view endlessly.

I would like to just make one comment concerning the main source of irritation to many viewers, i.e. Nick Jonas.  I have to admit that I also strongly resented his appearance and vocalization initially, but after several viewings I have come to the conclusion that he is either not all that bad considering the role he is playing or that the otherwise strong cast makes his relative inferiority not so important after all.  It also helps that I shut Michael Ball out of my mind as I'm listening to him.  If I want to hear Michael Ball I have the 10th anniversary video.  And like one other reviewer said, there's no way Michael Ball could have been carried on or off the stage by Jean Valjean.  Nuff said about that.

What I really want to say is, if you haven't read the book that this awesome musical is based on, please consider doing so.  Trust me, if you love the musical, you'll only increase your love and appreciation of it.  Boublil and Schonberg did an excellent job of transmitting the spirit of Victor Hugo's masterpiece considering their limitations (mainly that of time).  And for those who may never read the book, the fact that even this much of it is made known to the world is wonderful.  In fact I think Hugo himself would be pleased. And there are many who may not care to go any deeper, and that's fine.  But there is so much more contained in the book that you miss out on.  Not just in the story itself but even more importantly in the way Hugo tells the story. Admittedly, it is quite a tome, but even if you skip the detailed historical bits that go on and on for pages and pages (as I did my first reading... I am now on my third reading and taking the time to even read those) you will get a much fuller view of the characters and their interactions as well as their thought processes, and have your literary fancy tickled meanwhile.

Anyway, I could go on and on but I realize this is not the place to review the book.  I just felt compelled to remind all you lovers of the musical out there that music, lights, action and all, it is only a semblance (albeit an excellent one) of it's source, Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables"".

That said, the performances are also faster & a bit more alive.  But there are things missing that I found phenomenal in the TAEC; for instance, in this edition you see [and not very clearly I might add]a screen-projection of the horse and cart accident and are left to discern, for yourself, what has happened; where in the TAEC you see a wonderfully choreographed, physical acting out of the incident/accident  on stage.

Staged at the massive O2 entertainment complex in London, this 25th anniversary production manages to feel both intimate and epic, thanks largely to the well-placed camera locations and the magnificent sound design. And in the high definition BluRay format, the video and audio superbly renders this remarkable production. Since this isn't a staging of the actual play, but is instead a concert version, it might be helpful to know the basic plot points in advance, since certain of them are only hinted at. However, even without this background, the story is clear, as compelling as Victor Hugo intended it to be, and, for the most part, the vocal performances are flawless (sorry, Mr. Jonas, but you're just out of your depth here).

My advice: buy this BluRay. It bears repeat viewings (we have watched it three times already, and it only gets better with successive viewings). Crank up your 5.1 home theater system, turn down the lights, and prepare to be moved by a rousing production that is spectacular in the truest sense of the word.

4383688,5,B004I2K4E8,"I enjoyed the tenth anniversary as much as the next person.  But it doesn't quite measure up to the 25th anniversary.  The Les Miserables 10th anniversary version was better vocally, but only slightly.  And I really didn't care for the person who played Elnjoras in the 10th anniversary.  I thought the 25th anniversary Elnjoras was INCREDIBLE.  Alfie Boe sounds great, but does sound just a tiny bit weak at times.  As far as Nick Jonas as Marius, I can't stand the Jonas Brothers.  But I really didn't think he did that bad.  I mean, he's by no means the best of the cast, and compared with the others he does sound a tad weak.  But when he has his solos, such as Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, I thought he was pretty good.  The main thing I had with him was that you could tell he was straining his voice.  I will say that I thought Nick did a better job as Marius than the guy from the 10th anniversary did Elnjoras.

The set and the lighting in the 25th anniversary edition is superb.  The set barely changes, but it serves every purpose for every scene.  it is incredible.  The lighting is AMAZING.  I LOVED the big drammatic spotlights soaring everywhee during the big numbers such as One Day more.  And the flashing red and whiter lights in all the different directions during the battle scene was indescribible.

One final thing I need to comment on is the end.  In case you haven't heard, after the curtain call, the original cast comes out.  There is a quartet between four Valjean actors who sing Bring Him Home.  Then, the original and 25th anniversary casts together perform One Day more.

My one wish is that Nick Jonas had not been in the role of Marius. He has a voice that's good for pop, which explains his childhood career, but he is out of place in this strong opera style vocals, and it is a little distracting. I have seen his name on the cover of many copies in stores. Why? Why advertise him?
Aside from that, I think it kicks tail on all previous performances in print. I also own the original cast and 10th Anniversary audio CDs.

We kept watching when I realized that it was Les Miserables. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the performance of ALL the characters. I don't understand why people are being so harsh towards poor Nick Jonas. Yes, he might not have such a strong voice, but come on, he's only eighteen and he has plenty of room to grow in his voice, so sue him if he wants to break out of being a glorified pop star for Disney and branch out into something more substantial. It's not like he was out of tune, there were no parts where my ears started to bleed. He did a good job. I just think some people are snobby and don't want to see popular faces in such classic performances such as Les  Miserables. I believe that if people were just listening to the recording of the performance and not watching they would not be so harsh towards him.

Okay, first let's start with the good stuff.  Some folks will disagree, but I thought Alfie Boe was actually a better Jean Valjean than Colm Wilkinson.  Even though Colm will always been identified with the role, I felt Bowe had a stronger voice, especially during the songs that really required it (Who am I, Bring Him Home).  Enjolras was an amazing improvement over Michael Maguire from the 10th anniversary cast. As much criticism that has been heaped on Nick Jonas for this concert (we'll get to that later), Maguire appeared to be the amateur back in 1995. But Ramin Karimloo was amazing here - strong, powerful voice and hit all the important notes. Once again Lea Salonga was fantastic, this time as Fantine. I enjoyed Norm Lewis' interpretation as Javert, but as others have said, that role will always belong to Philip Quast.

Okay, Nick Jonas as Marius. Really?! Was Justin Bieber not available?  I know Nick is actually a Broadway veteran, but that was as a young child. He has a very soft, weak voice that became very obvious when compared to the other seasoned veterans on stage. He could not project his voice loudly enough when it really counted, and that really detracted from the show.  I understand why they could not cast Michael Ball this time around, since he's in his mid-50s, but surely there would have been someone, ANYONE, who could have done a better job. It's ""Les Miserables"" - you don't need a ""name"" to make it work.

I just loved the encore when they brought out the original 1985 cast (led by the aforementioned Mr. Ball) and they sang ""One Day More"" together, along with the current Jean Valjeans in London (the great Simon Bowman!).  That was really wonderful. I did wonder where were Patti LuPone (Fantine) and David Burt (Enjolras)? It's too bad they weren't there.

Overall this concert had a lot of good things that they improved upon from the 10th anniversary concert. But the 10th anniversary concert was great too. It's really hard to compare the two as I feel they each stand on their own merits.",1306972800,,2203,4.664082687338501
4383696,5,B004I2K4E8,"After seeing the current London production of Les Miserables in April at the Queen's Theatre, we decided to get the DVD of the 25th anniversary concert.  We're not disappointed.  The concert was phenomenal, utilizing the technical capabilities of the O2 Arena, and the DVD is excellent.",1306800000,,286,5.195652173913044
4383697,4,B004I2K4E8,"Like many others who've reviewed the 25th anniversary ""Les Mis"" here, I loved the 10th anniversary ""Dream Cast"" version and for me, many of the main characters remain definitive in that version, more so than this.

That said, this is still very enjoyable, with only two drawbacks for me. The pluses? The production itself is superior to the 10th anniversary--the staging, the orchestra and sound, the use of projection screens, the vast audience that clearly knows and loves the material (but has the respect for performers to stop applauding in the encore so we can hear them sing).

No one has ever been a better Valjean for me than Colm Wilkinson, but Alfie Boe was still excellent and his more ""operatic"" version was still moving. For me, Wilkinson is just such a superior actor and the passion and conviction that he gave Valjean (whether in desperation or in heroism) was so much more successful for me than Boe's interpretation. But...YMMV as both are indisputably so talented.

Likewise, I felt this Javert did not have the ruthlessness, nor the intellectual and moral conflict that Phillip Quast did. Norm Lewis was very good, but Quast, for me, was superb and his singing captured the character perfectly. Did they cut Javert's songs? I'm not an expert on ""Les Mis"" so I'm not certain if this was a trick of memory due to the performance difference or a genuine difference. Either way, Lewis' delivery was not as memorable for me, including in his final scene.

I enjoyed Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Bark as Eponine was very powerful. Enjolras moved me more here than in the original--and he was the only one whose performance I actually felt was stronger than the ""Dream Cast"".

So? The bad?  For me, there were two performers who didn't work for me at all. First, the much-commented on Nick Jonas. I had an open mind going in, as I was completely unfamiliar with his singing. But, he really does disappoint. Not that he doesn't have a pleasant voice--he does--and I imagine he has -some- vocal training. The problem is...it isn't nearly enough for this role. When Michael Ball comes out in the finale, it just painfully underscored how Jonas' weak voice and inability to project or hit the big notes really ruined Marius. (And, imo, he brought no romantic charisma to his duet with Cosette either--and lacked much emotion at the barrciades as well..
If he wasn't ""Nick Jonas"" there's no way this man would have been cast in this part, imo. Very unfortunate (and hard to believe it was necessary). And, yes, I know he was Gavroche on Broadway, but that doesn't require the vocal strength of any of Marius' songs. Imo, he took the part from someone who would have been so much better (I'm sure there are many singers who would have been better).

But, far worse, imo, was Matt Lucas whose acting, singing and general ""look"" ruined one of the biggest numbers, ""Master of the House"", for me (including post-Revolution), even bringing down Jenny Galloway, whose Mme. Thenardier had been so fantastic in the Dream Cast performance.

But...all that aside, if you've never seen it before, this would be an overall very satisfying production of ""Les Mis"". And, if you're a big fan of the Dream Cast, you might agree with me that it's worth getting this for the encore alone--with Colm Wilkinson, Boe, and two current Valjeans singing together--then joined by others from this and the 10th anniversary cast, for a rousing ""One Day More"".  That was a GREAT finale and made the entire thing, flaws and all, well worth it for me.",1306627200,4,3536,4.783606557377049
4383698,4,B004I2K4E8,"I am a total fan of this spectacular musical. I am very pleased that Les Miserables has reached it's 25 year pinnacle. But I have some issues with this 25th anniversary edition of the musical. Number 1: NICK JONAS!!!! A Jonas Brother playing Marius???? A role made hugely famous by Micheal Ball, the only thing Nick Jonas had going for him was his looks! He is a rock star and singer, clearly not broadway or even London's west end! I'm not saying I'd be against anyone else in that role, but was very disappointed in the choice. Strike 1 for Les Miserables. Second, the only veterans to return to the Les Miserables universe for this performace were Jenny Galloway and Lea Salonga. And Salonga wasn't even Eponine here! The only reprisal was from Galloway who portrayed the innkeeper's wife. I will say though, Lea Salonga's performance of Fantine was off the chain and if I couldn't see her Eponine return, this was the role to do. Bravo. Also, what in the holy hades happened to Little People???? The song sung by little Gavroche that uncovered Javert and proved that even the smallest can be the biggest. For shame Les Miz. You extend certain songs, but cut out fan favorites?

Alfie Boe - A worthy successor to Colm Wilkinson who originated the Jean Valjean role. His voice just resonated and made you want to follow his story.

The only other thing for me that made this version worth watching in repetition is after the finale plays. This is the point where 3 of the dominant versions of the cast got recognized. Primarily the original brodway cast that featured Colm Wilkinson and Michael Ball, both whom I mentioned earlier. Plus, the four Valjeans unite and sing a melodious version of Bring Him Home, and the nostalgia is rounded out by the original broadway cast belting out One Day More.

This is worthy of picking up, but if you want a repeat watch, go for the Dream Cast that happened for it's 10th anniversary.",1306454400,,1926,4.642228739002933

Casting wise... well, the 10th anniversary cast was better and more well-known for embodying the characters. In this production - Nick Jonas was awful plus terrible (I took away 1 star becos of him), Alfie was superb - v soulful, Cosette was surprisingly winsome and a very pretty soprano, Enjolras was also a standout.  Lea Salonga sang beautifully, but I preferred her as Eponine in the 10th.  This new Eponine was just OK.  I really liked Norm Lewis's Javert - as good as Phillip Quast in the 10th.

He did an okay job, but it was clear he was lacking beside the others. However, in his defense, he still did a great job. I don't know many of us armchair critics who could get up and do what he did!

I always found the voices of the London and Broadway casts to be harsh & not particularly easy on my ears, especially those playing Jean Valjean, Javert & Cozette. And Marius and Cozette always sounded older than the characters should be, which was a real turn-off.

I was so pleasantly surprised by how smooth and easy on they ears the voices of Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean) & Norm Lewis (Javert) were. I can't get enough of them! Lea Solonga (Fantine) & Samantha Barks (Eponine) seemed, in my humble opinion, to be perfect in their roles as well.

4383731,5,B004I2K4E8,"We loved this Les Miserables.  Wonderful singing (perhaps with the exceptions of Marius and Cossette).  Superb orchestra and chorus.  Fine Costumes.
What struck me was the way the characters, the values, and the situations assumed their archetypical dimensions.  The stylized, unrealistic presentation; the posing, rather than acting (except the innkeeper couple); the way characters died by closing their eyes and walking out of the spotlight -- all of these worked to show that the characters were not particularly individuals, but were types, types who are always among us.  The clash of values is equally archetypical: the greed for gain of the innkeepers who reappear in different guises -- reminds me of Milo Minderbinder in Catch 22; the vengeful anger of the early Valjean, and of the whoremonger; the selfless love of the bishop, of the converted Valjean and Marius' friend; and the rigid, unyielding sense of justice without love of Jouvert.  All of these values are ALWAYS clashing, competing for our loyalty.
Only a genius of Victor Hugo's caliber could present these archetypes in such an appealing, compelling story.  But this production does justice to the archetypes.  Indeed, it goes far beyong merely doing justice.  At the ""end"" of the show, the composers, the great librettist, and the producer came out to join the cast after the curtain calls.  This sense of Les Miserables just running perpetually through human time was enhanced, first by cast members from earlier productions coming out and singing numbers from the show, then by young persons who will be in future productions coming down the aisle singing.
The whole thing was at least as much a celebration as a show.  Love wins, Justice -- self-convicted -- loses.
Years ago I saw another Les Miserables which put me in touch of the eternal archetypes in Hugo's masterpiece.  It is the French film by Claude LeLouch, starring Jean-Paul Belmondo as two incarnations of Valjean.  This is great art!",1303776000,3,1975,5.1152647975077885

I agree that he is not at par with the other cast members, but he wasn't THAT bad, not bad at all. The role suit his voice and his personality. He is still young, if he wants to be involved in the theater esp. in Broadway, it's not too late for him to be trained not as a pop artist. There is still room for improvement.

to be desired.  Mind me, the music/orchestra espectacular, but the choosing of some of the main ""chracters"" wasn't the best. My scale from 1-10 is as follows: Valjean? 8, Cossette? 9, Javert? 10+, the children? 10, the Inkeepers? 8, the Monk? 8+, and Marius? 0. This one was the mistake of the whole production. Can't
believe Producers chose this weak/non expressive person to represent such a magnificet character.  What a waste! In conclusion; I have this DVD just to have the collection complete, otherwise I wouldn't even consider buying it.  The big
problem here is the original version (Wilkinson) who was totally in a different league;the whole cast (face expressions, voices, demeanor). Lea Salonga (espectacular), and the rest of the production.  I'm very thankful to Amazon, for offering these products at such a reasonable price.

If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, this is a must have DVD.

Also, if you have the DVD but have not seen the snippet of Bring Him Home encore with the 4 tenors on youtube.com, check it out.  The snippet from someones phone had better angles than the DVD.

4383753,5,B004I2K4E8,"Les Mis is one of the best operas written in the last 50 years.
No one calls it an opera.  But it is almost completely sung, seldom spoken.  Doesn't this make it an opera??
Oh, we don't want to scare people away.
This production is sung in front of mikes at the front of the stage.  The actor/actresses are in costume.  But they don't act out whole scenes.
Fantastic, large orchestra.  Great, large chorus.  The principle actors/singers are all opera quality except Marius, who is a popular rock star, young, handsome, curly black hair.  Very much looks like a young student.
For the battle scene at the barricades the huge light booms drop down, their lights turning up and down, flashing.  It is a very hellish, effective pandemonium.  Great.
At the end all 4 of the popular JeanVal Jeans sing together, or against each other.
Memorable.
I saw this on TV, then immediately ordered the DVD.
Thanks.
Incidently, I called the Cameron Macintosh organization.  They said they have no more performances scheduled in the near future for either Les Mis or for Martin Guerre anywhere in the US.  I saw the latter twice in Minneapolis and sent my relatives in LA and Seattle tickets.  They saw it.  Then for some reason it was withdrawn and never made its opening on Broadway.  Pity, it was very good.

4383759,4,B004I2K4E8,"The new production cuts down on some of the songs, reducing the number of songs. The negative I can see is the fact is the Val jean is touch too operatic and distorts from some of the feeling that goes into the role, and Nick Jonas obviously didn't have the training to hold so many sustained notes so ended up obviously needing air and having to take breaths between notes where there shouldn't have been. However, Samantha Barks, who starred on the BBC show I'd Do Anything where she was a third place contestant for the role of Nancy in Macintosh's revival of Oliver!, performed the role of Eponine beautifully. Also, we have once again Lea Salonga performing, this time in the role of Fantine. The kids who were Gavroche and Cosette performed quite well. Overall a fairly good production.

I don't understand why so many people have been over critical of Nick Jonas. As a 31 yo male I can easily say I am not in the Jonas Brothers demographic, nor have I listened to their music, by choice. I have two 6 yo daughters who do. I have to say that I was impressed with Nick Jonas performance. After watching his performance of Marius Pontmercy, I would say Nick should continue to pursue his career in broadway. People are quick to criticize his performance but after doing a quick google I found that this is not his first performance in a stage production. He has even performed in Les Miserables before as Gavroche in 2003.  It's refreshing to hear that someone who became a pop start has roots in stage and theater. I had my two 6 yo daughters watch this DVD and both were glued to the screen the entire time! The fact that Nick Jonas was in it helped a little I am sure.

This is an excellent show for the entire family. Get out and support local and national, theater! There is nothing better than live music and live theater!",1302825600,,1156,4.298165137614679

Now, I couldn't talk myself into buying it on PBS for a pledge of $125, but I had bought it from Amazon before the end of the intermission.  The performers are all fantastic with the exception of the Jonas who was not bad, but not stellar either.  Alfie Boe is also gracing my Ipod after seeing his performance.  It is a great DVD to throw on when you are working around the house or cleaning as the music is great even without the visual performance.  The only sad thing is that this is not available on CD to listen to it in the car.  This performance is absolutely worth the money if you are a fan of musicals.",1302739200,,761,4.27972027972028
4383767,5,B004I2K4E8,This is an amazing performance! I wish I had been fortunate enough to see it live but this DVD offers the next best thing.

4383768,5,B004I2K4E8,"We have loved Les Mis for over 20 years.  We own the previous concert version, also, but always regretted that it was not released in a 16:9 format with DD 5.1 sound.  This version does one better to that wish list and adds 1080P Blu-Ray HD.  So technically, this is the version to own if you have the hardware to display it.  In our case we have a projection system with a 92"" screen and sound to match.  I put it together myself and it cost less than most 55"" LCDs.  For this kind of program THAT becomes an event that's better than being there -- the popcorn is better (and cheaper) and our feet don't stick to the floor:)

As to the performance, well, we love Colm Wilkinson in the first concert but we always wondered how the piece would be with a ""real"" tenor (ala Placido Domingo). Alfie Boe comes close to that ideal.  It's a whole different Val Jean.  Wonderful !!  Norm Lewis as Javert keeps up with the main protagonist with a more than menacing but nuanced performance.  Lea Salonga is a repeat from the previous cast, albeit, playing a different part.  She is so familiar with this work that she could probably sing ALL the parts if she had to.  She's always enthralling.  The rest of the cast fill their respective roles with distinction.  Marius doesn't bother me as much as he does some reviewers.

So this Blu-Ray has it all.  It may be the single BEST Blu-Ray I have acquired because it is live HDTV rather than a Blu-Ray of a film.  Most films don't have the resolution of which Blu-Ray is capable.  Blu-Ray shines best when the original material was shot in HD video.  That is the case here and, along with a stunning performance and real sense of occasion, it ends up being our favorite Blu-Ray of the many we have.",1302739200,,1736,4.382445141065831

Alfie Boe is the best Jean Val Jean ever and that is quite a feat in a role that has been previously filled by such superb singers.  All the rest of the cast is riveting as well.  You will be amazed at the staging and the lighting as well as the two choruses and the orchestra.

4383786,5,B004I2K4E8,"If you're in the States, you're probably here because you saw the PBS broadcast of ""Les Miserables 25th Concert."" If you've been lucky enough to see one of the stage productions over the years, you don't need to be sold on ""Les Mis."" It's the world's longest running musical because of the power of its story and the grace of its music and lyrics.

But if the PBS Pledge-a-thon was your first introduction to the musical (or the book it's based on) and you're like me and usually read the reviews, you might be confused by the heat about whether the 10th or the 25th concert is better, and debate about which actor/singer shines in which role. You can safely ignore all this. Both concerts stand on their own merits. While the original cast has a right to be proud of how they shaped Les Mis, no show should be caught in amber. The 25th Concert has been almost completely recast, with a new, fuller orchestration, a different take on presenting the musical ""in concert,"" and 21st century light, sound and SFX.

And you're here because of Alfie Boe. The lead in ""Les Mis"" has never been sung by a classically trained, operatic tenor before, and it's easy to forget what a gamble Cameron Mackintosh took in casting Alfie. Despite having sung in European opera houses, starring in Baz Lurhmann's staged ""La Boheme,"" and the English National Opera's ""Kismet,"" he'd never crossed over into musical theater. And though he'd had a short run doing the stage version, Alfie was a complete cipher to most of the audience. ""Les Mis"" fans can be very partisan and very vocal. But by the end of Alfie's first numbers, Valjean's Soliloquy/What Have I Done, the audience roars its surprise and approval. His fresh appreciation of Jean Valjean and the power and grace of his voice is heart-stopping. (After ""Bring Him Home"" Alfie received over a four minute standing ovation, cut down to a minute on the dvd. I think the audience was applauding not just that stunningly beautiful song, but everything that had gone before, too. He deserved every second of it.)

So, yes, get the dvd or blu-ray. There aren't any extras, no ""making of"". But then, the concert itself, and the wonderful encores with the 1985 cast, and current Queen's and West End casts are more than enough. But if you would like a making of, ""Les Mis: Matt Lucas Dreams the Dream"" in four parts on youtube should fill the bill nicely.

And if you fall in love with the story, do yourself a favor and pick up the unabridged novel by Victor Hugo. Yeah, it's 1400pgs long, and Hugo famously goes off into wild, lengthy digressions on the Battle of Waterloo, orders of nuns, and others, but you can always skip over these if you like. The musical follows the book fairly closely, but a lot has to be passed over. Unfortunately, the Hollywood movie versions play fast and loose with the plot, and usually end before Valjean's death. Be warned.

So, welcome to ""Les Miserables,""one of the classics of Western literature. Proving that some stories are indeed, timeless.",1302307200,,3012,4.686200378071834

The quality and resolution of this DVD is superior to the recording that was done of the 10th anniversary concert.  It's a shame that the production qualities of the 10th anniversary concert were not that good.

I didn't think anyone could play the part of Jean Valjean as well as Colm Wilkonson, but Alfie Boe was simply outstanding.  He was a brilliant casting gamble made by Cameron MacIntosh, and I understand why MacIntosh made the gamble.  His voice and his acting were simply wonderful.

Norm Lewis was good as Javert, but no one ever has or ever will play the part as brilliantly as Philip Quast. I definitely mourned the fact that Mr. Quast wasn't a part of this production.  Also, I don't mean to be  politically incorrect,  but a black Javert simply isn't credible.

I didn't like Lea Salonga as Fantine, although she is a great singer. Ruthie Henshall's performance as Fantine in the 10th anniversary concert set the bar for pathos and acting.  The part requires a tragically beautiful, throaty voice and Lea simply doesn't have that kind of voice.

I was surprised that Jenny Galloway was Madame Thenardier again (as she played the part in the  10th anniversary concert).  I'm not complaining--she OWNS the part, is truly revolting and hilarious at the same time.

Matt Lucas was good as Thenardier, but Alun Armstrong (from original London cast and 10th anniversary concert) again owns the part, always will.  I was happy to see Mr. Armstrong at the end of the concert singing with the rest of the original London cast.

I loved the young beautiful girl who played Cosette--her youthful soprano voice was pitch-perfect.

Nick Jonas as Marius was pure celebrity casting of a mediocre talent.  The quality of his voice and breath control were poor. His voice stood out as the weakest link among the other  excellent voices he mixed with, ex: Ramin Kamirloo as Enjolas.

I loved the bonus at the end, the ""Bring Him Home"" quartet featuring Colm Wilkonson, Alfie Boe, and the two actors who play the part of Jean Valjean in the 2010 London productions.  As good as the others were in this piece, Alfie Boe  once again stole the show.

I would recommend this DVD to even the most ardent 10th Anniversary Concert fans.  Nothing can replace/upstage the 10th Anniversary Concert, but this one is still really, really good.",1302220800,,2476,4.838095238095238
4383792,5,B004I2K4E8,"I saw the musical on Broadway with Mr. Wilkinson and have been a HUGE fan ever since. I thought no one could be a better Jean Valjean than him.  But Alfie Boe just blew me away! What a gorgeous voice! Powerful yet still able to perform the sweet ""Bring Him Home"" with a gentle tenderness that was so moving. And with this edition, I got to experience the entire musical not just selected songs.  I think the only disappointment was Nick Jonas -- although he has a nice enough voice, he just can't compete with the other cast members. I've watched it 3 times already and I will be loving it for years to come!",1302220800,,608,4.278260869565218

With the exception of poor casting for Nick Jonas (very weak voice, no breath control, sour look throughout, outshone by EVERYONE ELSE, etc.) the cast is spectacular.  The camera work is supportive of the story and the sound is fantastic!  The finale brings back the original cast and is explosive!  The part of Marius, which is played poorly by Nick Jonas, is redeemed by an earlier Marius who sings in that finale.

Checked Amazon and found the DVD that PBS was showing for $19.99.  Not only that but also found out that there is also a 10 year anniversary DVD of the play.

4383798,5,B004I2K4E8,"This show was in a word spectacular! It was incredibly well arranged for a concert presentation. The plot flowed smoothly with the help of screens placed behind the players on stage. The only weakness was (I love him dearly) Nick Jonas. He did a good job in some areas, but he was clearly not of the caliber of the other professionally trained actors. He was great as Gavroche on Broadway, but the role of Marius was a bit too much for him. I feel that Camilla Kerslake would have been a better Cosette, but apparently she was ill and not able to perform. If you are a Les Mis fan this is definitely for you.",1302134400,,608,4.2956521739130435
4383799,4,B004I2K4E8,"I cannot, as much as I'd like to, give this concert a perfect score.  I thought to myself with singers like Lea Salonga, Alfie Boe, Norm Lewis and Jenny Galloway to name a few... what could possibly go wrong?  I spoke too soon.  Now, I'll be fair and say that if I hadn't seen Michael Ball play Marius first, my criticisms wouldn't be as harsh.  But I did.  And Nick Jonas' performance proved without a doubt that him being on stage was nothing but an awful attempt at getting younger viewers to watch the show.  The poor boy couldn't hold a note during any song.  His voice kept cracking and his facial expression was one and the same throughout the whole thing.  He looked like he was in pain.  I probably did too, while having to listen to him.  His lack of range and power was most evident during the Act 1 climax 'One Day More' when during the last chorus his voice was supposed to be heard over a cacophony of other singers.  Nope, didn't happen.  Ruined the song.  Now the saving grace was that Michael Ball made an appearance at the end and sang the same song.  The huge applause he received was probably the audience saying 'that's how it's supposed to be done'!

On to other performances, I thought Alfie Boe was a wonderful Jean Valjean.  Perhaps a little too controlled at times, but there's no doubt he has a powerful voice and Norm Lewis as Javert was just the perfect foil.  I loved Lea Salonga's performance for the most part, there were times when I thought her facial expressions got to be too much, but in the end she sang the songs perfectly and with much heart.  I really can't complain, she just has the most clear, pristine voice I've ever heard.  Lastly, I'm so glad the producers were able to get Jenny Galloway back on the show.  She was just perfect this time around as she was on the 10th anniversary.  Overall, I like how this concert was set up compared to the 10th anniversary.  I liked how the performers interacted more with each other, and how they were able to leave through a walkway instead of having to sit in the background like in the 10th anniversary.  So, in a nutshell, if you can tolerate Nick Jonas butchering beloved songs like 'One Day More' and 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables', then get this concert!",1302134400,2,2248,4.429268292682927

He does a credible job, not a great actor for certain, but he has a good singing voice. He was in the company of some very accomplished West End and internationally well known people and was bound to suffer by comparison. The DVD is a wonderful collection of orchestration and singing from Alfie Boe, Lea Solanga, Samantha Barks, Ramin Karimloo, Norm Lewis, Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Rebecca Caine, Frances Ruffelle and the casts from the two companies of Les Miz, playing in London at the time.

4383810,5,B004I2K4E8,":) I really enjoyed this show!!!  I have to say that Alfie Boe as Val Jean was great.  Though Nick Jonas seemed a little uncertain at times, I did enjoy him as Marius.  I've seen the 10th Anniversary DVD and I liked this one better simply because they chose to act out the whole musical throughout the concert, not just sing the songs.  It helped fill in the gaps for me.  Since I've not been able to afford to go to the theater to see this wonderful musical, it was a blessing for me to be able to see it through this format.  I guess if you were a real critic, you could find stuff to be at fault in this rendition, but I just enjoyed the music, and the chance to see the whole musical on screen.  I've even got my boys singing some of the songs with me, especially 'One More Day'.  I hope to see them do this with more broadway musicals.

The disk from amazon.com sold in the US contains tracks in Spanish, which is why we purchased it.  In fact, this title sold in the US contains an insane amount of text tracks in different languages.  My only comment about the spanish text track is that there are many areas where the translation is not even close to the audio track.

I believe the criticism of Marius is far too extreme, and certainly not something which detracts from my enjoyment of this performance.  However least I be too forgiving, I must say that none of the 25th performers are up to Phillip Quast or Ruthie Henshall (this comment made me go to You-Tube and listen to Ruthie sing ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" and Phillip sing ""Stars before finishing this review).

The show, of course, is excellent with very few exceptions. Nick Jonas is uninteresting to watch but his voice does fit Marius well. He's clearly out of his league. Lea Salonga is the most committed actress I've ever seen on stage. She's just the greatest.

Jean Valjean: Alfie Boe has such a fantastic voice! It was different from all the other Valjeans. It was so pure, yet strong. He knocked Colm Wilkinson out of the water without this one.

Javert: Norm Lewis was great. He had such a strong voice and served as the perfect antagonist to Valjean.

Fantine: I personally think that Lea Salonga is a better Fantine. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous, but I think better suited for Fantine. She sounded amazing! I have never come across a Fantine I liked until now. Lea Salonga was just...wow

Cosette: Cosette, as a character, is as boring as watching paint dry. But Katie Hall is as good as Judy Kuhn, who was also very good.

Marius: He honestly wasn't that bad. Yes, he was much weaker than the rest of the cast. However, he did show off a more immature side to Marius and brought a more youthful side to the role. While I don't really think he belonged in the 25 Anniversary Concert, he was good enough.

Eponine: Samantha Barks is probably my favorite Eponine. Lea Salonga has a beautiful voice and was a fabulous Eponine. But I think Samantha Barks injects the emotion needed for Eponine. She has rougher voice (as opposed to Lea Salonga's pure, perfect voice), without sounding whiny and still sounding beautiful. Samantha was amazing during ""On My Own"" and ""A Little Fall of Rain.""

It wasn't a perfect performance, but I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend it.",1300838400,7,1569,4.622302158273381

4383839,4,B004I2K4E8,"The four stars are actually because of the bonus material.  Three Jean Valjean singing ""Bring Him Home"" including Colm Wilkinson was a thrill to see. The original London cast performing ""One Day More"" was spectacular.  If only the rest of the concert was that thrilling and exciting.  For some reason, the perfomrances just seemed good, but not great.  Let's face it, any performance of Les Miserables cannot be terrible because of the wonderful score.  However, there are some recordings and concerts that are better than others.  After watching hte original London Cast perform ""One Day More"", I would have rather have seen them perform the concert.  The 10th Anniversary Concert cast was far better.  Even Lea, the original Kim from Miss Saigon, was better 15 years ago as Eponine than she was as Fantine.  Ncik Jonas gave the best performance he could as Marius, but no one can do it better than Michael Ball.  Jenny Galloway appeared in both the 10th and 25th concert, but she seemed far better and more enthusiastic in the 10th concert.  So, while this was very entertaining, the 10th anniversary concert was better in terms of casting and performance.  The one thing I like about this concert is the camera angles, closeups, and shots.

The 10th Anniversary cast and recording of Les Miserables in Concert is so inspiring - so perfect. Please opt for that one instead of this flat and insipid cast and production. There is absolutely nothing compelling in the 25th anniversary version.  I was sickened and could not stand watching anymore. EEWWHHH!

I had the good fortune to see the original Broadway production in NY.  Please, please seek out the 10th anniversary DVD and CD to get the truest experience of a wondrous and marvelous production. It was groundbreaking and continues to inspire.

The ""modernized"" 25th anniversary edition is just awful. Rather like the kids putting on a very amateur production in the back yard. But this lacks even that depth of feeling.

No soul. Just commercialized pablum. Horrible - 25th anniversary CD or DVD - avoid at all costs!

I even have to give kudos to Nick Jonas.  This isn't his background, it probably isn't his world (musical theater) but you could see that he gave it his all and while he could learn more about connecting  with his fellow performers on stage (eye contact!), his voice wasn't as strong as the others, and his face was a little too stern all the time, it didn't ruin the show for me - he was endearing and he sung his heart out.  It was lovely seeing Michael Ball and many of the others at the end.  Lea playing the role of Fantine was great - she's such as pro; and Alfie, oh Alfie your voice brings my heart to life!

All the talent in the world available and this was the best cast they could come up with?  Three (three!) of the leads don't sing at all, they spend a considerable amount of time just speaking on pitch (not the same thing at all).  I am almost at a loss for words.  Yes, the acting was acceptable, but this is musical that is all about the music.  Yet they couldn't find a cast who can sing?  Really?  The reason I only caught parts of the show last night was it was so poorly sung I found myself squirming until I just had to change the channel.  Not an exaggeration.  Granted I am a classical musician, maybe if you have a wooden ear you won't care, I don't know, it looks fine and seems well acted even compared to the 10th Anniversary show, but the singers from the 10th Anniversary show can STILL sing circles around this cast 15 years later.

This is a great performance all around- really, you definitely should buy it! But what I want to address is all of the reviewers casting aspersions on Nick's performance as Marius. Watching it for the first time, I had no idea who played the part of Marius. I was so impressed with his voice and acting that I looked up the show on imdb.com and, to my amazement- whoah! it's Nick Jonas! In the past I have INTENSELY disliked the Jonas brothers, simply based on the fact that they are Disney pop sensations, and we all know what usually happens to Disney pop sensations. Nick's performance as Marius, however, has caused me to take a second look at him. He has actually undertaken a serious acting/singing role, and done it well!

After seeing it on PBS, I immediately went to Amazon and ordered my own copy.  In the role of Jean Valjean, Alfie Boe was up to par with Colm Wilkinson, as was Norm Lewis in the role of Javert.  I agree with the previous reviewer about Lea Solonga as Fantine; not quite as full as Ruthie Henshall. Cosette and Eponine were equally represented in their characters.  Nick Jonas was merely OK in singing, and stiff in the acting.  As was stated in other reviews, he was outclassed by the magnificence of the rest of the cast.  Political casting to attract the teeny boppers.  If the grand finale didn't leave your heart pounding, you missed something along the way.  I will continue to watch both productions, with preference to the 10th, but will watch the 25th on occasion as well.

4383848,5,B004I2K4E8,"Having easily watched the 10th Anniversary DVD over a hundred times, I was very anxious to see the 25th Anniversary.  The first time I watched it, I was disappointed.  But after watching it again - and again - those disappointments all vanished.  There's a learning curve that we 10th-Anniversary idolizers have to go through.

From the very beginning I had complaints: What are those big screens up there?  This isn't a football game!  It's disorienting!  Can't they tell a simple story without all this gimmickry?  And why are the overhead lights moving?  Who would want to sit under those big contraptions?  Some of the songs sounded different.  It seemed that they cut-out some material, making the story-line harder to follow.  But now all is forgiven.  I feel this 25th Anniversary production is wonderful.  Here are some random observations:

The song ""One Day More"" is (in my opinion) the most wondrous song in all of musical theater history.  All the different characters come together at the end of the first act and in their own voices, singing their own songs, assert their reason for living.  I agree with another reviewer that this was not exactly pristine.  But with everybody expressing their own wills and singing their own words at the same time, it's SUPPOSED to be a bit cacophonous.  Even the 10th Anniversary had some messiness in it.

I thought the 25th storyline was more clear in the scene with the bishop, because the silver candle-holders were actually handed to Valjean, however it was less clear in explaining how a runaway cart was lifted by Valjean and how another man was arrested as a Valjean look-alike.

The 25th was special in showing Valjean tearing-up his yellow card and declaring that ""another story must begin"".  Then the stage went dark and the name ""Les Miserables"" displayed on the screen.  This suggested that the play was only now beginning - that everything before was just prologue, just exposition.  Wonderful touch!  (Disney is also good at movingly introducing the title after an extended prologue - especially with the movie Pocohontas.)

Like another reviewer, I too jumped off the couch and ran up to the screen when I saw the old Valjean from the 10th Anniversary appear on stage.  When he later stepped forward, I thought he was going to thank the audience, but instead the soft sounds of ""Bring him home"" began in the orchestra and I was ecstatic.  It was also wonderful to see the 10th Marius, as ebullient and powerful as ever.  It was touching to see the 10th innkeeper, such an endearing-looking man.  I had trouble recognizing the others.  Was the 10th Inspector there under that beard?

Speaking of the innkeeper, the 25th innkeeper was made to look evil whereas the 10th was made to just look seedy.  Both were great.  However I preferred the 10th ""Master of the House"" song because Valjean and the others could be seen sitting in the background laughing and clapping and singing along.  It was like an intermission.  I also thought the 10th ""One Day More"" was extra touching because Valjean and the Inspector were standing next to each other.

The 25th Fantine was just magical. I could not look at her face during her solo after she got fired - her expressions were that powerful.  I was surprised at the difference in height between Fantine and her boss and wondered if he might be wearing 'elevator shoes'.

The 25th little boy (Gavroche?) was very special.  He enunciated so clearly while maintaining that impish smile.

I was grateful to see the actual composer, lyricist and producer come on stage.  I feel so indebted to them for having brought such joy into my life.

One last thought: there is a depth to this work that becomes more apparent on multiple viewings.  Be SURE to enable subtitles so you can read what they are singing, otherwise the learning curve will be much longer than it need be.",1300147200,29,3871,4.8
4383849,3,B004I2K4E8,"Unfortunately, having grown up watching and listening to the 10th Anniversary Les Miserables in Concert, I found the 25th Annivesary performance underwhelming.  I think my main complaint was the casting of Nick Jonas as Marius.  Although a decent singer, the 17 year old pop star did not have the skill or emotional depth that was required to portray a leading man's struggles with love and revolution.  The highlights were definitely Lea Salonga's intriguing return as Fantine instead of Eponine and Alfie Boe's vocal talents.  Encore performances by the original cast at the end of the show were also a treat.  However, if you want to see this musical's performances at its best, I highly recommend the 10th Anniversary in Concert instead!",1300060800,10,741,5.090909090909091

I think this concert will make him a household name. Nick Jonas has a sweet voice and face. He makes for an unassuming and naive Marius, but lacks the operatic quality heard in most of the cast.

Alfie Boe has a good voice and he interpreted Jean Valijean well.  At the encore / finale, it is absolutely splendid to hear the stunning performance of ""Bring Him Home"" by the four Jean Valjean's.

Banks' voice, emotions, expressions -- all of it was absolute perfection.  I also thoroughly enjoyed Lea Salonga as Fantine, a role much better suited to her than that of Eponine.  Alfie Boe made a great Jean Valjean -- very emotive.  As for Nick Jonas -- yeah, he wasn't the best Marius I've ever seen.  But he did a decent job, and it gave me more respect for him as an artist.  He's been singing pop songs for too long; maybe if he stays on Broadway for awhile he can get up there with the greats.  I would have liked him to deck the Thenardiers, though.  I saw Marius do that at one show, at the wedding, and looooved it.

I did enjoy the return of the original cast reunion. I also enjoyed the expanded version that included most/all of the production, not an edited version. Nick Jonas as Marius?  In my opinion, he did not have the power to project like a broadway-type singer.  I do not think this is his forte.  Neil Patrick Harris was in an anniversary of Sweeney Todd, but he actually did the part justice.  Lea Salonga is really too old to play forta (Fontine).

I suggest you watch the 25 th anniversary concert on PBS, as they're airing it this month, or view excerpts on YouTube .
It was horrific . I was so dissapointed. I've seen the production on broadway several times, and in Boston, and also own both the DVD and CD of the Les Miserable 10th anniversary concert, which was superb with an extraordinary cast.

In general I realize no two casts are exact. That is the beauty of broadway , to hear many talented voices.
But this 25th Anniversary version is so mediocre. I could not believe it. And Nick Jonas as Marius. What a disaster.
He has no voice for the stage at all. And I was embarrased for the poor kid, honestly I was. But overall the cast was just fair, at best, except for the Thenardiers, The Bishop, Gavroche, Even Lea Salonga who had played a fabulous Eponine in the 10th anniversary concert, was not suited at all  to play Fantine. Wrong vocal range , and she was struggling.

I can't believe , that for a climactic event such as this for  this production, how poorly the casting and how below average the talent was. Check out YouTube first, and try to watch excerpts from the 10th anniversary show . You will likely want that version.
Even if I only ever saw this 25th Anniversary version, I wouldn't have bought it, nor be inclined to see it repeatedly at the theatre.
There were way too many wrongs about this version. One or two great performances . But that's it. A big bummer !",1299974400,13,1532,4.418439716312057

Very enjoyable, and as mentioned everyone gives a very good performance, with special shout out to Alfie Boe; gives Colm Wilkinson a run for his money; well done. Nick Jonas is obviously miscast and way out of his league, but not as bad as some reviewers state. Also like Salonga better as Eponine. The encore, with the 4 Valjean's and other members of the original cast such as the great Michael Ball, is nothing short of fantastic. Having said that...........as good as this is, if you don't already own it, go out and buy the 10th Anniversary DVD. The 25th is very good, but the 10th was just flat out Great and superior in every way IMHO. Nothing negative on the 25th, it's just there is a difference between being very good and being great.

4383858,4,B004I2K4E8,"The production was very well done, and I am happy that I watched it.  However, I am so glad that I own the 1998 ORIGINAL 10th anniversary Dream Cast DVD, which I purchased any years ago.  What I really liked about the 10th Anniversary production is that the big screens in the back had information introducing the scenes, so it was easier for those who don't know the story line to follow what was going on.  Also, those screens showed scenes from the play, so there was a lot more impact - especially when it showed the barricade from one of the plays when there were so many deaths.  There was just too much left out of this production.  Plus, Nick Jonas simply did not have the vocal range needed for Marius; he was the weak link in this production.  I am wondering why he was chosen to do this part (?)

I just discovered that the ORIGINAL 10th Anniversary 1998 DVD release of ""Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert""  is no longer available new.

I think I may have actually shuddered when I heard he was playing Marius. However, I found nothing to dislike. I should have stopped being snobby long enough to listen. His voice may not have been as powerful/trained, but he still has an excellent voice and I thought his portrayal of Marius was very convincing.",1299888000,9,563,4.475728155339806
4383860,2,B004I2K4E8,"I am so glad I bought the 10th Anniversary concert along with buying the 25th anniversary concert.  The 10th Anniversary is fantastic and the cast is infinitely better than 25th Anniversary cast! I've read other reviews about the quality of the 10th Anniversary DVD but the picture and sound are fine. I bought the 10th Anniversary about two months ago when I saw that the 25th anniversary concert had been released. I purchased the 10th Anniversary concert because I saw that Colm Wilkinson was Jean Valjean and I had seen him in the live musical in London in 1991 and he will forever be the definitive Jean Valjean to me. Also, the end of the performance on the 10th Anniversary edition which has many different actors who portrayed Jean Valjean in different countries around the world joining Colm Wilkinson on stage to sing ""Do you hear the people sing"" together with lines from all their native languages is stunningly beautiful and moving. The entire ensemble of actors really is a dream cast - it is just stand-out after stand-out perfomances.  Particularly spectacular performances are given by Phillip Quast as Javert and the absolute delight of Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - his rendition of ""Master of the House"" in the 10th Anniversary concert is a truly joyful experience that should not be missed by anyone who is a true fan of the musical - the entire stage of actors who are behind Alun as he sings that song are visibly delighted and enjoying his rendition of that song as much as the audience. Conversely, the 25th Anniversary edition concert is a true disappointment - the cast is just not as strong all the way across the board and even some of the stronger performances just do not compare to the renditions in the 10th Anniversary DVD. I am a person who LOVES the live musical - I've seen it twice in London and twice on Broadway and if you're like me and are just a true fan of the musical, the 10th Anniversary dream cast concert is a must - so I would really recommend that concert version over this 25th anniversary edition. The 10th Anniversary concert is a joy to watch and makes me happy and inspired every time I watch it and I really believe others will feel the same way!",1299888000,12,2204,4.619897959183674
4383861,5,B004I2K4E8,"It's amazing to me to see so many differing opinions on these two concerts of a show most all who are writing adore in one way or another.  To say one is MUCH better than the other is strange to me.  Being a fan of the show, I find it impossible not to enjoy both to a very high degree.  To dislike one or the other is incomprehensible to me.  Remember, I am non-expert fan of Les Miserables....not unlike most who are reading (and writing) these reviews.

I prefer the 25th Anniversary concert because of the technically superior audio and video production of a modern DVD.  Actually, I have not seen the DVD - I purchased the Blu-ray, which is EXCELLENT.  This brings up a point I think important for the reader who is weighing a purchasing decision:  writing a critical review of the DVD/Blu-ray based on a viewing on PBS television is not quite fair.  I have not seen this on television, but from past experiences, what is broadcast on PBS is often missing content and/or the sound is not nearly as well re-produced.  If watching on a television with no special sound (no amplified 5.1 setup), then the 25th Anniversary DVD edition loses one big advantage.  It still has superior video in any setup though.

A little perspective:  the 10th Anniversary is called ""The Dream Cast"".  The 25th Anniversary was not called ""The Dream Cast 2.0"".  They are 15 years apart.  The Dream Cast was presented during the show's heyday.  Today, Les Miserables has lost popularity and isn't performed anywhere near as many times live as it was back in the day.  With both concert versions, the producers have apparently chosen to select performers who have had a relatively recent history with the show.  After 25 years, how do you come up with another ""Dream Cast""?  This is a major disadvantage for the 25th Anniversary version, and all things considered, I think they did a spectacular job in selecting the newer cast.

Now, what about the actual performances?

Valjean - Colm Wilkinson & Alfie Boe:
Nobody ""owns"" a role more than Colm Wilkinson does playing Valjean.  This is not undeserved because he is simply awesome in the role.  In attempting to create a newer version of a Les Miserables Anniversary concert without Colm Wilkinson in the lead, is a daunting task I wouldn't want.  The producers found and were able to get Alfie Boe, and I think they found the perfect man for the job.  His rendition is different but not so much that it seems out of place.  Alfie's voice, without considering the role, is my preference over Colm's.  I like Colm in the role better - he's Valjean (and vocally, he's no slouch).  But Alfie blew me away this time around and is perfect for this updated version of the concert.

Javert - Philip Quast & Norm Lewis
Similar to Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Philip Quast ""looks"" the part of Javert.  He's got a lot more than that going for him though.  His version of `Stars' is 2nd to none.  Add to that, Javert is my favorite character in Les Miserables.  Norm Lewis doesn't look like anyone's version of a ""Javert"".  After watching his performance several times though, he is becoming very much a ""Javert"" for me.  His portrayal is every bit as resolute as any.  His singing chops, though a bit different, are growing on me even faster than his evolving ""Javert-ness"".  His `Stars', along with his suicide, are highlights of the concert.....very much like any excellent Les Miserables show.

Fantine - Ruthie Henshall & Lea Salonga
Every performance I have ever seen of Fantine has been outstanding (or at least my memory says so).  Having owned the 10th Anniversary VHS tape - and later the DVD, I equate Fantine with Ruthie Henshall.  Nothing has changed that view to this day.  I would say that is VERY high praise of Ruthie (and not undeserved).  Lea Salonga, like Norm Lewis fighting against ""cast"" or stereotyping, is even better though.  I am floored by how good she is.  Not because she is different, but because she becomes Fantine and makes me feel everything the director wants us to feel....and she does it with a style of voice I am more drawn to.  One thing I like about her is the way she finishes songs.  She holds the last note as long and as clearly as anyone, and the clarity in which she finishes the lyric adds an impact to not only the lyric but the entire meaning of the song.  Some say she over-emphasizes words, but the impact she gives to meaningful lyrics is something no one has ever been able to duplicate (for me).

Eponine - Lea Salonga & Samantha Barks
What more can be said about Lea Salonga? How much time do we have?  Eponine is my 2nd favorite character in Les Miserables, and like the performances of Fantine, I have never been disappointed by an actress/singer who I have seen live or heard professionally recorded.  Anyone know who played Eponine in London around October 2009?  Whoever she was, she was awesome and reminded me of the original Eponine, Frances Ruffelle.  Lea Salonga's Eponine is my preferred choice though (every bit as good as her Fantine too).  Listen to the last half of `On My Own' from the 10th Anniversary concert for another example of what I mentioned above about finishing a song.  Wow.  Samantha Barks was unknown to me, and she pretty much blew me away as Eponine.  When it's time to let the emotion of the song go, she lets it fly with the best of them.  Her voice is clear and powerful, and her Eponine fits in perfectly well with all the other fantastic performances I have witnessed.

Marius - Michael Ball & Nick Jonas
Ah, the one everyone either loves or hates.  Michael Ball is deservedly the greatest Marius anyone has ever heard - there is no competition and no comparison.  Nick Jonas takes a ton of heat for ""not measuring up"" to any of the current cast, let alone to Michael Ball.  I don't disagree.  However, if you have made it this far, you know my opinion on everyone in the cast is pretty high.  Nick Jonas was not brought in for all the 12-year olds that will be watching.  He actually had an affiliation with the show.  And not just playing Gavroche as a small child....he actually played Marius in the West End in London.  Maybe that was a bit of a ticket-inducing ploy (to 12-year olds), but I think his appearance in a concert version of the show is not wholly appalling.  I would like to get reviews of 100 people who have never heard of him.  My bet is the bulk of them would not be nearly as brutal as many here.  He's not great, I get that.  He does do a fine job in areas though.  His `Empty Chairs and Empty Tables' compares in no way to that of Michael Ball's.  But on its own merit the performance is completely watchable, if not quite good.

Cosette - Judy Kuhn & Katie Hall
Never cared for this role.  Don't quite know why.  In re-watching the 10th Anniversary concert recently, Judy Kuhn's voice impressed me.  I am still not impacted by the songs in the same manner as most of the others though.  Katie Hall pretty much was the same - that is, she was impressive:  very nice voice but songs still don't quite work for me.

I will stop with the individual comparisons - except to say I preferred the Thernardier's in the 10th Anniversary version.  Recall, Jenny Galloway reprised her role in the 25th Anniversary - and was just as good a Mrs. Thernardier.  Also, the two actors who played Enjorlas (Michael Maguire & Ramin Karimloo) were both excellent in their respective concerts.

I guess I should wrap this up.  One thing I want to address is some of the silly or thoughtless comments some make when criticizing.  To say Nick Jonas ruined the entire show is just shameful and discreditable.  How many minutes is he on screen?  To say Lea Salonga is too old to play Fantine is ridiculous.  She was all of 39.  Patti LuPone, who originated the role, was 36 when she started playing Fantine.  Judy Kuhn, who played Cosette in the Dream Cast, was 37....37 as Cosette...you know, Fantine's daughter.  She returned to Les Miserables (on Broadway) as Fantine at 49!

People bring enough preconceptions on their own....unreasonable comments don't help anyone and do a disservice to everyone.",1299888000,24,8112,4.585654596100278
4383862,4,B004I2K4E8,"Has it really been 15 years already??  I thought it was only a couple years ago when my friends and I caught the 10th anniversary on PBS!  Well, I am a HUGE fan of this musical.  I have watched it twice live and love listening to it on CD.  I was ecstatic to catch the 25th anniversary on PBS (twice!).

First the negatives (2 stars off):
1. Nick Jonas - his voice is not terrible, really.  It just does not have the depth, and it may be a maturity level, but regardless he should not have been casted as Marius at this time.  Who knows, maybe in a decade his voice will mature?  Additionally, his one facial expression got annoying after the first song.  I really could not look at him anymore.
2. The producers for casting Nick Jonas - I am actually more ticked off at the actual decision to cast him!  He is obviously not ready for this part, but it seemed like they wanted to use him as advertisement.  ""Les Miserables"" can stand on its own without any pop celebrity's help.

Now, I do have to give a star back for Norm Lewis.  His voice is perfect for Javert!  I think he is the best Javert I have heard!

Overall this concert was fantastic.  I am awfully biased toward John Owen-Jones, having seen him live, but Alfie Boe as Valjean is amazing!  His ""Bring Him Home"" and ""Finale"" had me crying just as hard.  I'm always happy to see Lea Salonga sing anything, and Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras- wow!  And the encore with the Valjean quartet was like icing the cake - could not have thought of a more perfect ending!",1299888000,3,1517,4.278169014084507
4383863,3,B004I2K4E8,"We just saw this on public TV. While it was a very nice job, I do not think it rates as high as the 10th anniversary production. The lead female singer is excellent, but I did not think the lead male carried quite as much impact as the 10th anniversary. In addition, the finale was a bit disappointing. For those who have seen the 10th, you know it ends by having lead male singers from many countries - Germany, Japan, Spain, etc. sing in their native language!  It was awesome. The 25th ending had the top leads from the early days and current productions, but nothing like the 10th year. In addition, I had a hard time understanding the young female lead - she was too near the mike and the young male had too much of an English accent for an American audience.
I liked it, but not enough to give it more than a 3.",1299801600,3,817,4.203821656050955

I haven't watched my VHS of the 10th anniversary in ages so I can't compare.
These characters left the biggest impression on me
Javert - loved him.  Wonderful voice
Gavroche - adorable - his cheekyness was perfect.
Marius - UGH.  Ok, not ugh.  The Jonas Brother simply doesn't have the vocal strength for this. I've thought many times, ""why couldn't they have let one of actors who have a smaller part play Marius and stunt cast a smaller part.""  His voice is Ok I guess, but it is ordinary and the rest of the cast was extraordinary.",1299801600,,738,4.553030303030303

What an unpleasent surprise was to realize a Jonas Brother was singing the role of Marius. Sorry but this singer doesn't belong here. His voice was simply too weak, forced and the poor guy sticks out like a sore thumb. Having said that, Valjean and Javert were absolutely dreamlike.

Unfortunately, this one didn't. Lea Salonga was soooo perfect as Eponie 15 years ago. Her replacement in the 25th just couldn't hold up to part. And while I was surprised Nick Jonas had some bit of a voice talent, he just wasn't a trained operatic singer. It was disappointing that he was casted as Marius. Really? Come-on! All in all, I'd much rather listen to my CDs from the 10th than watching this 25th cuz the latter just isn't worth watching :(",1299715200,11,607,4.735849056603773

Though all the singers do a fine job, with the exception of Nick Jonas, who is just not up to calliber with the rest of the performers, they just can't compare to Colm Wilkinson, Phillip Quast, Lea Salonga, etc. The one vocal that I did think was an improvment was Katie Hall as Cosette. One thing I did like about the 25th anniversary over the 10th was the inclusion of more of the smaller scenes, like when Marius and Cosette meet on the streets of Paris, and when Marius sends Eponine with the letter.

It is backed up by three large TV screens so that the large audience in the theater can have close ups, and this also enhances the viewing and pleasure of DVD viewer.",1299715200,,454,4.416666666666667

This concert was out of this world.  While no one does it better than Colm, Alfie Boe gave it the role of Valjean such power.  You can read everything else on the other reviews, I agree with them.  I would like to talk about Nick Jonas.  First, can we please stop comparing him to Michael Ball!? Ball originated the role and no one can compare to him, but that was 25 years ago (and again 15 years ago) and he isn't Marius any more.  While I agree that Nick's voice was weaker than the others, there was a naive and hopeful quality to him that really suited the role and was well cast against Katie Hall as Cosette.  So, while his wasn't the strongest of the show, it isn't fair to compare him to the original and someone who is a veteran of Broadway.  I think we need to allow Nick to develop his voice and recognized that he carried the character well.  When you look at the whole picture of this AMAZING concert, you'll see that the characters that really carry the show are so beyond well cast and the DVD is sooooooooo worth owning for anyone who is a fan.  Enjoy it and take the role of Marius for what it is, a young boy hopelessly in love finding his way, which Nick Jonas (a young boy finding his way) plays well.",1299628800,,1365,4.17175572519084
4383871,4,B004I2K4E8,This is an amazing concert of Les Miserables.  The only complaint is the stunt casting of Nick Jonas.

  The production values of this 25th Anniversary Concert is simply fabulous. From the big
stage to the bigger cast , the lights and the orchestra . Everything seemed grander. Alfie Boe's performance is excellent. I need not mention each and everyone of the marvelous cast.
With the obvious exception of Nick Jonas , every one had very strong and powerful voices.
Nick Jonas' voice was so puny and nasal and it was so disappointing to hear him belt out Marius' songs. He has this single facial expression throughout his performance that makes me think he is having some abdominal discomfort.( He might not even make it to the top 24 in American Idol .) He was definitely miscast and I just wonder how the producers or director  missed this fact before the actual performance. To add insult to the injury, Michael Ball sang the same songs in the finale with so much conviction and power .

Awesome performances, except for Nick Jonas, what were they thinking when they thought it would be a good idea to put this pathetic ameteur on stage with true professionals?  With his weak voice and pained expression, it was pitiful to watch and just as painful to listen to.  I wouldn't let it ruin my overall impression though.

With tickets to see it this coming August when it returns).  To me, this musical is truly the greatest ever made!

Inevitably, there will be comparisons between the original cast from the 10th Anniversary Concert and this one; that is to be expected (my review will be along those lines as I have watched the 10th and 25th anniversary performance back-to-back).  Trying to meet or exceed the performance of the original cast is almost an impossible task; however, most of the performers rose to the occasion and at least met the performance demands!

There were a few parts where the performances seemed a little weak; I would like to know if this is the recording of the first performance or the second performance, I suspect that fatigue was wearing on a few of the performers toward the end.  Alfie Bow (Jean Valjean) and Norm Lewis (Javert)have to put a LOT of energy into their respective parts and I think it was showing toward the end of the show; but, for the encore they had to have found their second wind as they brought their vocal power to full strength!  I felt that the parts of Thenardier and his wife were a little on the weak side as well; nothing I can really put my finger on, but it did seem a little underwhelming.

While I know little about the Jonas brothers, other than they are pop singers, I would have to say that casting Nick as Marius was a mistake.  While I'm sure that Nick may have a very good voice for pop singing, it is not of the caliber necessary for a stage musical; this became VERY evident when Michael Ball (the original Marius) came on stage for the encore and sang one of his parts.  Sorry Nick, you have the looks for the part but you need to concentrate on your voice to get it up to strength for the task of a stage musical.

Saving the best for last, Lea Solonga as Fantine was marvelous!!  Lea played the part perfectly, though I do admit to some nostalgia in wanting to have seen her play Eponine one more time (as she did with the original cast).

Overall, even with the few misses, this is a hit and I shall enjoy watching this many times over.  The even more exciting part about the disc though was at the end of the credits it was announced that Universal will be making the musical into a movie!!!

My daughter saw that Nick Jonas was in it and decided to watch it.  (She's 7 and I hadn't introduced her to this particular show, although she has seen many - including Wicked).  I have to say, all of the criticism of Nick is uncalled for.  I admit, he's not the best I've ever heard, but he's not the worst either.  He held his own throughout the show.  The music, staging, lighting were incredible.  I only wish that just one time a concert like this would be staged in the States, rather than London.  I would travel just about anywhere to see a concert such as this.  I got chills during ""Bring Him Home"" and cried during the Finale.  For the encore, when the original cast came out - well that was worth waiting for.  Colm Wilkinson singing ""Bring Him Home"" with the other Valjean's was beyond amazing.  I have always considered this song a prayer and the harmonies and blends of this performance just proves how much of a prayer it is.  And the encore of ""One Day More"" was unbelievable.  Again, to the Nick Jonas naysayers - there has to be a reason he was cast.  I agree that his voice wasn't as powerful as some of the others, but he's young and is still learning.

Desipite those who criticize Nick Jones as Marius, I think it is refreshing. For the snobs who get all wigged out from the fact he is a ""pop start"", you might get your nickers unbound to know he cut his teeth in the Theatre (poo poo) in Les Mis, no less, as a child. I think his performance as Marius was accomplished - ok, anyone compared to Michael is going to fall short - but that shouldn't take away from the work Nick put into it. Give the lad a break.

Along with countless others I too have been an enthusiastic fan of this great work; I have had the opportunity to see it on stage and have owned the LaserDisc version of the 10th Anniversary Concert for many years. The power, beauty and drama of this work never fails to profoundly move me when I watch it and the melodies haunt me for days afterward.

When I saw the 25th Anniversary Concert was available on Blu-ray I ordered it immediately; my first thought was how it would compare with the 10th Anniversary Concert that I had watched so many times on LaserDisc. I almost thought of myself as a judge who would sit in judgment and pronounce sentence.

I wasn't very far at all into the performance before I lost that mindset; I was swept up by the beauty, power, and emotion of this performance. Yes it is different from the 10th Anniversary Concert but suddenly that was of absolutely no importance as I felt I was witnessing a glorious, emotional performance of fabulous music.

To get the technical considerations out of the way; the video and audio are all you would expect from a contemporary Blu-ray recording. The picture is clear and crisp and the surround sound is a delight to the ears. The only real disappointment with this disc is the absence of any liner notes; no commentary, pictures, nothing. It doesn't really seem like too much to ask that something be added that gives information on the cast and performance.

The performance itself left me feeling that I had received my money's worth and more; I noticed at the end of the disc, after the concert that people in the audience seemed to be milling about, not really ready to bring the evening to a close. I felt the same way as if a wonderful experience was over before I was really ready for it to end.

The closing credits mentioned something I was unaware of, a movie version was in the works. Well hooray, finally a movie version of the entire musical! I had off and on been checking to see if a movie version with full staging and action was available but had always been disappointed to see that it had not.

It appears that during an interview in Spain, last September, a journalist asked Cameron Mackintosh why a movie version of Les Miserable's had not been made. It is reported that he said a contract for a movie had been signed and he said in part,""We'll be working with a screenplay writer over the next few months and hopefully if all that comes together, we will find a great director and start."" That is really good news to those of us who have loved the concert versions.

I'll not make an attempt at evaluating all of the individual performances but will say that Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean brings a truly memorable voice to the part. The other roles are handled with emotion, power, and conviction; I found I had tears rolling down my cheeks at several points during the performance. Two tidbits of casting trivia, Lea Salonga, who sings the role of Fantine in this production sang the role of Eponine in the 10th Anniversary Concert; Jenny Galloway performs as Mme Thenardier in both performances.

If you enjoy great music, well performed, you really owe it to yourself to buy this disc; if you don't have Blu-ray then get the DVD, just don't fail yourself by not buying it!",1299456000,5,3337,4.557595993322204

(The ""high octave surprise"" hits you like nothing you have ever experienced before) Colm Wilkinson will always be Valjean in my mind and in this encore performance, he brings every emotion to the song. The man could almost sing with his face alone - he is that good! In spite of Nick Jonas and what I feel was a miscast for him to play Marius (which is so blatantly pointed out when Michael Ball delivers his first note during the incredible encore), I will maintain my 5 star rating. The blu-ray picture and sound quality were incredible!! As a huge fan of the original cast recording and the 10th anniversary concert, I highly recommend opening your hearts to this fresh and captivating take on what is probably the greatest musical of our time.",1299456000,,1073,4.62303664921466
4383883,4,B004I2K4E8,"Different casts have different interpretations - that's just how it is. I've seen 5 different casts in full productions, have the original London and Broadway cast recordings, as well as the ""complete symphonic"" recording (my personal favorite), and the 10th anniversary edition - and now this one.  I enjoy all of them for different reasons, and my personal ""dream cast"" would be a mix from all of the above.  There is one individual performance that I will comment on because everyone else has, and that is Nick Jonas.  Personally, I liked his reading of the part. Going as far back as the novel, Marius is the young innocent schoolboy who got caught up with the fanatics of the ABC Club (i.e. the other students). Jonas' youth coupled with his admittedly low-power voice gave Marious a sense of vulnerability that is frequently lacking in this belt-fest of a score. One other musical note is that I agree with the previous post about the poorly mixed ""One Day More"".  This is one of the most amazing ensemble pieces ever written for the musical stage, but it only works if all the voices are balanced.  The ""complete symphonic"" recording is the only one that seems to have gotten this right.

My four-star rating comes from the fact that once again the producers cut portions of the score.  It was ""more complete"" than the markedly trimmed 10th anniversary concert, but still... To go to all of the expense to put this concert together, why not do it completely unedited to have a video record of the full score?  Of course, better yet, why not record an actual stage performance and make it available on video? In some respects, the 10th anniversary was superior in that it at least had videos of stage performances displayed in certain crucial scenes. One of the most powerful images from the modern musical stage comes during the ""Bring Him Home"" instrumental when the barricade revolves to reveal all of the dead students and the fallen flag.  Close-ups of the orchestra just don't do this justice.

But all that said, the technical brilliance of this recording will keep me coming back for many more viewings...",1299456000,6,2119,4.780821917808219
4383884,4,B004I2K4E8,"I agree with many of the reviewers on the absolute stunning performances of many of the roles, particularly Valjean and Javert -- while Colm Wilkinson is still my #1 fav, there was a tenderness in the way Alfie Boe played and sang the role of Valjean, and Norm Lewis (""Javert"") was INTENSE and did a wonderful interpretation of that role.  Also, Lea Salonga was just amazing.

That said, why I didn't rate this ""5 stars"" was because of some pretty big misses.  Nick Jonas played the role of Marius as well as Michael Ball if not better, but his singing just could not come close to what Ball brought to the stage: he appeared to miss so many notes that I began to feel like an ""American Idol"" judge, wanting to urge him to stick to pop music.  The orchestra was poorly balanced, with brass absolutely slaying the strings and woodwinds, leaving some very tender and moving countermelodies almost totally unheard.

In the end, though I totally embraced Alfie Boe as the central character and would pay big bucks to see him sing this role, this felt like a ""let's bring back Les Mis but freshen it up a bit"" and that they did.  I enjoyed watching it, but if I were to reach on the shelf for a version I truly enjoy, it would be the 10th Anniversary Edition.",1299456000,12,1254,4.430434782608696
4383885,5,B004I2K4E8,"I first saw this production on PBS during one of their begging periods and because of all the long interruptions did not fully enjoy it.  I immediately the next day I pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon which was shipped February 22. It is a great show with glorious voices except the Jonas kid who was totally miscast.  With a big sound system turned up this production is delightful to watch and listen to.  The DVD package, however, shows Languages:  English Dolby Digital 5.1 as a sound option.  This is not correct.  The sound setup on the DVD only works for 2.0 and the 5.1 option is grayed out and does not function. So, don't expect surround sound from this DVD. If you like the show and enjoy beautiful singing you'll like this show.",1299456000,3,738,4.511278195488722
4383886,4,B004I2K4E8,"Granted, there are several stunning moments by this cast, most notably when Alfie Boe brings down the house with his version of ""Bring Him Home"" and again when Boe,Colm Wilkinson and two current Jean ValJeans sing that song together.

But the main fly in the ointment was the miscasting of pop singer Nick Jonas as Marius...a gaffe made all the more obvious when Michael Ball, a stellar Marius in the show's earlier days (including the 10th anniversary), made an appearance during the delightful encore and reminded everyone what Marius' voice SHOULD sound like.",1299369600,44,562,5.043010752688172
4383887,4,B004I2K4E8,"A clearly exciting night and a truly enjoyable concert style performance of Les Miserables. Much has been made in the commentary about the miscasting of Nick Jonas, and there is much to be said on that -- though it is also worth noting that Jonas played in Les Miserable's original Broadway run back in 2003, playing Gavroche, so I was willing to cut him a bit of slack. That said, lacking the controlled diaphragm of the rest of the cast made him stand out for his lacks, sadly.

Beyond that, while there was perhaps too much hamminess in some of the emoting, it was in the end an extraordinary production. If you like this musical (or just the music from it), this would be a good choice. If you aren't familiar, the 10th anniversary is probably a better choice as a start.",1299369600,15,775,4.457746478873239
4383888,2,B004I2K4E8,"Get the 10th Anniversary Edition. Nick Jonas is really miscast. The audio mix on ""One Day More"" is inexcusably bad. Remember, it's about the music and the story, not the lighting and effects. Alfie Boe is does great as Jean Valjean.",1299369600,16,232,4.682926829268292
4383889,2,B004I2K4E8,"I admit it is unfair to hold the 10 year Anniversary Concert as a standard. Those performers were all top notch, and the execution near perfect for a live performance. That being said, the 25th Anniversary falls far short. Nick Jonas is an embarrassment as Marius. His voice is not that great and his acting worse, the same expression used for the entire performance, like he was experiencing gastric pain. He should stay away from the theater and stick to singing for 12 year-old girls who have no discriminating musical taste. ValJean and Javert were decent performers, but in my opinion neither possessed the powerful voice required for their roles. Bring Him Home was the best performed song, the higher pitch of the song seemed to be in singer's wheelhouse more so than the rest of his numbers. The girl who played Eponine appeared to have a strong sweet voice, but she spoke more than sang, clearly annunciating each word at the expense of her singing. Even Lea Salonga as Fantine was disappointing - she seems to have lost the canary-sweet voice that she had 10-15 years ago.

I will say the video and audio quality were excellent (Blu-ray). The big chorus numbers such as At The End of The Day were also good. I am waiting for the day when the 10 year concert is remastered and released in 5.1 audio, however with the 25th just coming out now, I don't expect that to happen anytime soon (if ever).",1299369600,12,1405,4.62
4383890,3,B004I2K4E8,"So I am a huge fan of this show, I have multiple recordings and for years loved watching the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast concert. I was so excited when I saw this was coming on Blu Ray and I bought it without even watching any previews or reading any reviews of the actual London concert.

Is it a good concert? Yes. The staging is impressive and the Blu Ray treatment gives you flawless video and audio quality. The performances are good but nothing like the stellar performances of the Dream Cast.

There are a few notable exceptions, I will keep this disc and treasure it for Lea Salongas performance as Fantine. Her pristine voice and great acting ability knock her performances out of the park. A great treat to see her 15 years after the Dream Cast going from Eponine to Fantine . And speaking of the Eponine, Samantha Barks did an amazing job in that role. She was completely unknown to me before this and had huge shoes to fill in my mind and to my shock and immense pleasure she did just that. The last note in On My Own had me standing up and cheering. I won't say she is better than Lea Salonga in that role but she absolutely holds her own.

Nick Jonas is a complete distraction in this show. His Marius has none of the depth that previous performers have given that role. His singing skills are not up to par with the material. Being fair though he did do a DECENT job on Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, but it no way has the impact that the song normally has on me. He brings down many of rousing anthems and really keeps them from reaching the soaring heights they normally would like. One Day More is the song most affected by his lackluster performance but Red and Black and Do You Hear The People Sing are equally watered down.

There is a saving grace on this disc and that is the finale after the show ends. They bring back the original 1985 cast for One Day More and it had me leaping out of my seat. Also the original Valjean sing Bring Him Home with his contemporary was quite stirring. Having Michael Ball on the stage reprising his role as Marius reminded me how it should have been.

There are some things on this disc that are magical and worth owning but as a whole it was flawed in my opinion.

So the end result is this, I will be keeping the blu ray for Lea Salonga and Samantha Banks performances however I will also be ordering the 10th Anniversary DVD which has finally been re-released after being out of print for many years.

My wish as I said in the title of this review is that the 10th Anniversary Concert got the blu ray treatment.",1299110400,245,2570,4.308488612836439
4383891,3,B004I2K4E8,"My primary critique is of the DVD itself and not so much the content.

All I received is a bare-bone Blu-ray DVD. No history, playlist or background information like found in the 10th Anniversary.

The 25th may be fine for those familiar with the story line, have read the book or seen the performance on stage; but, IMO, not for a first time viewer of Les Misrables.

We have seen the play on stage in London and a USA touring production. I prefer the cast of the 10th Anniversary performance.",1299110400,6,494,4.466666666666667
4383892,5,B004I2K4E8,"Great purchase! Lea Salonga's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was stirring and brlliant.  Her voice has matured from when she played Eponine.  Is it possible for her to be my favorite Eponine AND Fantine of all time???  The Jean Valjean quartet singing ""Bring Him Home"" during the encore was EPIC!!!  Alfie Boe certainly has a new fan in me. (The ""high octave surprise"" hits you like nothing you have ever experienced before)  Colm Wilkinson will always be Valjean in my mind and in this encore performance, he brings every emotion to the song.  The man could almost sing with his face alone - he is that good!  In spite of Nick Jonas and what I feel was a miscast for him to play Marius (which is so blatantly pointed out when Michael Ball delivers his first note during the incredible encore), I will maintain my 5 star rating. The blu-ray picture and sound quality were incredible!!  As a huge fan of the original cast recording and the 10th anniversary concert, I highly recommend opening your hearts to this fresh and captivating take on what is probably the greatest musical of our time.",1299024000,2,1081,4.62303664921466

The sound and HD video was just perfect. There is an extra surprise at the end that I will not detail here, but be prepared the be blown away!",1298592000,3,438,4.289156626506024

We felt that the videography, lighting, and filming quality was inferior to the 10th Anniversary show.  The videographers spent too much time on distace scenes where we, like the audience, watched the close-ups on the screens above the actual performers.  Kind of bummer.",1298505600,4,401,5.03030303030303
4383898,5,B004I2K4E8,"While I'd love to see a DVD of this incredible show with a little more staging, this cast makes up for it out of sheer talent--with one exception.  Yes, it's the much misaligned Nick Jonas.  I felt sorry for him at times;  he is so out of his league among these other performers.  Whose idea was this?  Thank god it wasn't Justin Bieber (he might have made a good Cosette).  This aside, get this one.  It'll make the hair on your head stand, and yes, the Encore/Finale is awesome!",1298505600,9,480,4.325842696629214
4383899,4,B004I2K4E8,"The important thing to note is that every cast will differ a little.  Every broadway/east end fan knows this.  That said, many of us who love the Dream Cast from the 10th Anniversary DVD have probably seen the same DVD countless times in the past 15 years.

So this entirely new cast with their own interpretation will take getting used to. Many of them are good such as Norm Lewis as Javire, Samantha Barks as Eponine, they are 2 of the shining standouts from this cast. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is good too but will take getting used to. Quite a different Jean Valjean than I'm used to.

Everyone else is good or passable with 1 exception. Nick Jonas as Marius is TERRIBLE!!!  (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 stars).  He is one of the better looking Marius' I've seen BUT he has only one expression throughout the entire show.  Be it sorrow of happiness or anger he has that one constipated look on his face.  His voice is very weak, this is very very obvious when you hear the other men at the barricades.  Also the trio melody of Marius, Eponine, Cosette again its painfully obvious that there is absolutely no strength behind his voice.  The solo ""Empty Chairs and Empty tables"" is usually very moving, but not when Nick Jonas sings it.

Despite that singular casting mistake, this is still worth the buy especially if you love Les Miserables.  It shows you a slightly different interpretation of the songs/show which theater goers love.  Its worth the buy.  Also, judge for yourself if Nick really is as bad as I say.  (I'm pretty sure most will agree with my opinion).",1298419200,24,1576,4.519434628975265
4383900,4,B004I2K4E8,"Excellent and enjoyable production.  Don't really understand the overblown criticism of Nick Jonas, who I thought did a fine job.  Just a quick note for those who weren't aware, Mr. Jonas began his career on broadway as a child in NYC, so I wouldn't consider him unversed in theatre.  And I am not a teenager, I am far past it.",1298419200,6,327,4.416666666666667
4383901,5,B004I2K4E8,"Having seen this show several times both in London and on tour in the US, it was a huge treat to be able to experience this 25th Anniversary Performance from the O2 Arena. I was fortunate enough to see it in  a US theatre the one night it played a few weeks after this was recorded. This show sold out the gigantic O2 so quickly they added a second show, which also sold out. It  was beamed live to theatres around the UK. And it just won ""Theatre Event of the Year"" in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers Choice Awards. I am delighted that they decided to make it available for Region 1. As wonderful as the 10th Anniversary show was, this is better in some ways. The lighting, the sets and projections, the lush orchestrations and the vast audience that just electrified the air add to the whole experience.
This was an incredible group of performers that still gives me chills when I recall it. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, is trained as as operatic tenor. He was spectacular in every way. He shows a very supple vocal range. He can hit & hold the high soft notes & belt out the big showstoppers with equal dexterity. I really do like Lea Solonga but felt she was just a little weak as Fantine. (She was killer as Eponine on the 10th.) Norm Lewis was a wonderfully wicked yet human Javert. His baritone strong & menacing & yet soft & soulful as he wrestles his conscience and loses. Katie Hall was a convincing as Cosette. Nick Jonas, in a bit of ""stunt casting"" that went badly awry, was Marius. It was glaringly apparent when matched with multi-award winning West End & Broadway veterans. Though he did get better. (This actually played two nights in the UK October 2-3. This is a compilation.) Canadian, Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras, the student leader, was impeccable. He has previously played this role & that of Marius. He's starred as the Phantom in London & is now playing the role in the sequel, Love Never Dies. (He has already twice been voted ""Best Actor in a Musical""  & is nominated for an Olivier this year for the same role.) Matt Lucas and Jenny Galloway obviously enjoyed their time as the Thernadiers, which made them great fun to watch. The encores must be mentioned again. They were incomparable to anything I've every seen.  If you love Les Mis, you will love this show. Don't try to compare it with the 10th. With its rich new orchestrations, new sets, some changes in the lyrics and slight yet clarifying changes in the show, it stands alone.",1298332800,147,2458,4.504484304932736

I just couldn't believe how amazing everything was. I know everyone is saying that Nick Jonas was horrible, but he did the best that he could and he really wasn't that bad! Everyone else was just simply amazing, and there were many times when I found myself holding back tears, especially when the 4 Valjean's sang Bring Him Home. If you're a fan of Les Mis, and are HESITANT about buying this. DONT BE! This is amazing, and I'll probably watch this over and over again!",1298332800,8,602,4.383928571428571

Similarly, Lea Salonga, Katie Hall, and Norm Lewis are all amazing in their roles. Nick Jonas, while not up to par with the other stage regulars, is not as bad as most will make him out to be, and his performance of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" is actually quite good.

4383904,3,B004I2K4E8,"I may be bias for Ruthie Henshall but she stole the show in the 10th Anniversary and her youtubes from that concert prove it.  I actually became a big fan of Les Miserables through watching the 10th Anniversary then scouring for whatever other clips i could find, then eventually purchased the 10th Anniversary DVD from Amazon.  Then i became a fan of Ruthie but that is not to say i didn't enjoy the other talent, in fact i was hopelessly addicted to the music from Les Mis altogether.  This concert is okay and not bad but Lea Songalia who plays Fantine just isn't that same immaculate voice that Ruthie has.  I enjoyed Lea's early youtube clips of her doing the Disney Aladain songs and her voice was excellent for those songs but i have not enjoyed her much in the Les Mis concerts including this one.  Her voice just seems too light and tender with a higher pitch for my tastes.  If you haven't watched or listened to the 10th Anniversary Concert i'd recommend purchasing that one before this.  There is a reason why Ruthie Henshall's TAC Youtube clips have so many views and its probably the best concert performance i've ever seen between I dreamed a dream, Come to me, and Lovely Ladies.",1297814400,12,1195,4.55607476635514

He tends to drop out of notes too soon and during ""One Day More"" it just got lost in the shuffle. Other moments he sounds rushed, as if he wants to get the notes out so he doesn't have to hold them too long. You can argue he's a decent pop singer, but for stage work he just doesn't have the power needed to project and Marius has to project. Maybe if he trains that will change but he was definitely the weakest of the performances in the show.
