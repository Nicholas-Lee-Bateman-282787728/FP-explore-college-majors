2822566,5,B000PHX5NM,This production of Footloose has become a classic and is why I purchased it.  Flashdance  is a very good movie but not the classic Footloose has become.  To have both of these achievements in one package for the price is a steal.  I do have some feeling of guilt for not paying the fair price for this DVD.,1417996800,,306,4.224137931034483

2822578,5,B000PHX5NM,What's best than having one or two of the best dance movies from the 80 s.  There is nothing like the original,1388880000,,110,4.0
2822579,3,B000PHX5NM,Flashdance is a very silly movie but is fun to look at.  Footloose has lousy music; can't believe my generation called this a classic.,1382745600,,134,4.583333333333333

2822581,5,B000PHX5NM,"The word dance is what links Footloose and Flashdance.
Footloose is about a young teen boy who moves from a city to a very small town where popular music and dancing are not allowed.
The movie follows his struggles to fit in with an environment that it totally foreign to him and the resulting effect he has on this rigid
unhappy town.

Flashdance is an entertaining movie built around the life of a young girl who longs to go to a dance institute but has no qualifications to get in.  She struggles as a dancer in a nightclub while her heart seeks the ballet.

If you like music, dancing, romance, you'll like this movie",1378857600,2,621,4.4298245614035086

Believe me when I say you can't go wrong in purchasing this DVD if you enjoy good acting and excellent quality, along with some great music,(if you own a DVD player that plays the DVD to the upconvertion the quality is just about as good as a Blu Ray DVD)

When I purchased it, I believe I got it on sale from Amazon.com for $9.99, but it is now listed on the site for the price of $11.43 (which is still very much worth it IMHO).",1356652800,,528,4.0673076923076925

Is of good quality and design of the box is original because it has double safety.
The part I dislike is when I realize that no audio or subtitles in Spanish, only brings in English and French.",1329436800,,372,4.180555555555555
2822605,5,B000PHX5NM,"I love both of these movies, feel they are very clean cut enjoyable entertainment. Watched the new movie out Footloose which was awesome, so I just had to see the original again. I enjoyed Kevin Bacon better in the role of Rin, but enjoyed Julianne Hough better as Ariel.

2822610,4,B000PHX5NM,"Well I had to see this 1983 flick again.  It wasn't a favorite but its a classic.  Nothing wrong with it I just am not a dancing Bacon fan. Now.... if he is playing an evil dude like in Hollowman or X-Men: First Class totally different response. I think he is great as a mad scientist or toying with world domination.  He must have ""been there and done that, and got the T-shirt"" in a past life, hah! hah!  But don't pass it up on my account because it is a good film or you could say 'period piece' depicting the early 80s.

I picked this & the original 1985 ""Fright Night"" (great flick!) double paks up to review and share with my nieces before seeing the remakes.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Night-Urban-Legend-Two-pack/dp/B001DB6J5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Night / Urban Legend (Two-pack)</a>",1320537600,,854,5.25

They are both movies I loved as a teenager, and my daughter has watched Footloose at least 10 times already! The price for both was FANTASTIC, and delivery was less than a week!! Very happy with my purchase from Amazon.com and will continue to look for those good old movies that are too hard to find at a great price in stores!

Sincerely,
Kelly Monasmith",1318377600,6,478,4.623529411764705
2822612,5,B000PHX5NM,What can I say about these two great 80's movies. It just brings back awesome memories & are two classics for sure. Wonderful idea to put these two together.,1311724800,3,157,4.448275862068965
2822613,5,B000PHX5NM,Great music...you can't sit still while any of it is playing.  You will have to get up and dance around.  Kevin Bacon was fabulous in this movie.,1295827200,2,145,4.333333333333333
2822614,5,B000PHX5NM,"I was looking for Footloose -one of my all-time faves- but I'm a fan of both movies so I instantly saw the brilliance in putting these together; this double disc combo really is perfect. Both of these movies are meant to be inspiring, and of course the rockin' music and fabulous choreography have always pumped me up to WANT to dance, so this combo is kind of like a life-affirming, super-fun and calorie-burning 3-4 hour aerobic set! Pop em in and get up and dance! It sounds cheesy but if you appreciate these movies the way I do, you know what I'm talking about!

Footloose of course is about a cool city-boy stuck in a small-town with closed-minded, painfully strict church-loving and God-fearing people who believe that dancing and rock n roll are sinful devil's work that do nothing but make kids want to copulate (and the problem is....?). City-boy shows them the truth (music in all forms is good for the soul, and dancing is man's way of celebrating life! Ain't THAT the truth?!) and the errors of their ways in an inspiring 'fight for what you believe in' story with killer music, killer dancing, and the insanely hot Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer. If you appreciated the 80's, you can't lose!

Flashdance of course is a 'work hard and reach for your dreams' story about a young woman who  dreams of going to a prestigious dance school to become a professional and respected dancer, and she certainly has what it takes! There isn't as much dancing as I would've liked in this movie, as it is also a romance and centers on that and her day jobs and yadda yadda, so for me the whole movie is basically just a long lead-up to the final amazing and powerful dance rehearsal, and THAT is what makes this movie hot. They should've done more of that. Still a good one though.

Footloose I give 5 out of 5 stars
Flashdance I give 3 out of 5 stars

And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is my review. Thank you and stay tuned for the next one.....",1287187200,6,1941,4.471751412429379
