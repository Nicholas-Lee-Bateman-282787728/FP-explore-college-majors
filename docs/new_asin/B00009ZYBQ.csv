7994886,5,B00009ZYBQ,Brian Reynolds did not compose this music. The soundtrack was composed by Duane Decker.,1460160000,,87,5.285714285714286
7994887,5,B00009ZYBQ,"This is the soundtrack from the best RTS of an era, in 5.1 surround sound. It is a live recording and as such there are imperfections (I.E. the flute's mic placement is just a bit off for ""Across the bog""

This is a live recording and is incredibly high quality sound, the imperfections are organic and expected in any performance - perfect music is computer generated. This is played.

Get it, you won't regret it.",1256688000,2,415,4.52
7994888,3,B00009ZYBQ,"i live and die, still, on rise of nations. the soundtrack is great, has all the in-game background music that i hear in my dreams anyways. one big, major bummer, it does not contain the great piece from the opening of the game, showing the many cultures of the game, nor the most striking menu song, the name of which i do not know",1231804800,,331,4.1875
7994889,5,B00009ZYBQ,"If you have ever played this game, but neglected to listen to the music, as well, then you are most definitely missing out. Brian Reynolds has composed a couple dozen spectacularly rounded pieces to express and give meaning to all cultures and walks of life in this soundtrack. The DVD also has some great features, such as an insightful interview with Reynolds, the option to listen in 5.1 Surround or the original stereo mix, and even watch the game introduction mastered for larger screens! This DVD was a lot of fun for me.",1170288000,2,527,4.67741935483871
