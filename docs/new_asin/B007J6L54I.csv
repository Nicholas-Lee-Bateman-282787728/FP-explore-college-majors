5090806,3,B007J6L54I,"This scent is a little odd. I'm not sure how to describe it - it's a little cheap, a little chemical smelling. I love this brand and use a lot of their other sachets, which I give 5 stars. I just don't really recommend this one.",1358985600,,228,3.9782608695652173

5090814,5,B007J6L54I,"One of my clients has some of these. Her house is always smelling fresh so I decided to give them a shot in my home. Amazing! Strong smelling, but no chemical smell like another reviewer mentioned. I put the lot of six around my home in the following areas:

On top of my hutch in the dining room
In a basket on my entertainment center
Underneath a linen cabinet in my hall bathroom
In a basket by the entryway in my kitchen
In my daughters' closet
In my closet

Within an hour, the aroma had filed the whole house. I didn't open the bags as the smell seeps right through the packaging. I haven't left my home long enough to be greeted by either a stale smell or fresh passion flower upon my arrival home but will find that out shortly.

I plan to order another set to put around my basement.",1459814400,,792,4.197368421052632
5090815,5,B007J6L54I,My step daughter gave me one of these for Christmas and I do not know where she bought it! I love love love the scent. I had to buy more and I have them placed all over my house.

5090831,5,B007J6L54I,"I've been using these scent sachets for a while now and was very happy to find them on Amazon at a cheaper price than I have been paying. Some room freshening scents are very strong and can even make you nauseous but that is not the case with these beautiful scent sachets. Placed strategically around your home or in your closets or drawers you will get to enjoy the fragrance for a very long time. The lavender and jasmine scent sachets are also my faves.
They arrived more quickly than I had expected which is a bonus.",1392940800,3,521,4.381443298969073

5090836,5,B007J6L54I,This is my favorite sachet from Fresh Scents.  I used to buy it from BB&B but they stopped stocking the Fresh Scents Sachets so I went online to find it because it is the best freshener for closets.,1384732800,,198,4.2105263157894735
5090837,4,B007J6L54I,"Happy to find a source for this product because local merchants often run out of the Passion Flower fragrance, which is my favourite.

The package was shipped quickly and the price was fair, However, the packing needs to be more sturdy and protective, even if the shipping cost is increased. Handling while in transit had crumpled the end of the package and the sachets inside. Fortunately the contents didn't spill out.",1369785600,,420,4.915492957746479
