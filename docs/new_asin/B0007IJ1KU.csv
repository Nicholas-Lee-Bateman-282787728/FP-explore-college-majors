8047510,5,B0007IJ1KU,"THis film does an excellent job of portraying the factors that keep the illicit flesh trade alive in third world countries. Against the backdrop of the tourism industry in Campbodia the film-makers weave a story that may well be the reality of the lives of many western tourists and Cambodian girls. It does a good job of depticting the financial and social tragedies that force women to join the sex trade. It also shows the other side of the picture and you almost feel sorry for the good-natured pimps who are forced in to the trade due to abject economic situations or just bad karma. They also show how the deparvity of the foreign tourist, in cohort with local mafia keep this horrible, inhuman business profitable.

I was most impressed by the cunningness /cleverness that the film-makers showed in marketing the film. The DVD has a picture of a very beautifull and sexual woman being dressed by her helpers. The scene looks very erotic and the name of the film (Return to the Kama sutra) is suggestive of eroticism. However, the film has a social message and has nothing to do with the Kama Sutra or eroticism. I think they understood that this is the best way to reach across to the lay audience who may otherwise not pick up such a film at the rental store (if it had a title like ""Prostitution in Cambodia"", for example), but may feel encouraged to take a second look at something that has a attractive picture on its cover and a suggestive title.

It is sad that one has to resort to such tactics to educate people about social issues. But as the recent American elections have shown, packaging, rhetoric, and choice of words are what is most important in our society today.

I would recomend everyone to actually buy this film, especially since the proceeds from its sale go to the Cambodian Women in Crisis organization that help resettle women who have been rescued from the prostitution racket.",1108080000,8,1910,4.661721068249258
