1210895,5,B00000FCYU,I am enjoy the comedy of yesteryear. Bob Hope was one of the better comedians of this time.,1125532800,,91,4.111111111111111
1210896,5,B00000FCYU,"""Son of Paleface"" was my introduction to Jane Russell, who really burns up the screen in her role as the saloon girl/outlaw leader - and it's a great Bob Hope flick too.  A worthy sequel to ""The Paleface"", it pairs Hope with Russell and the duo of Roy Rogers (a good straight man who ends up as the third point in the movie's love triangle) and Trigger.  Lots of music - including a reprise of the Oscar-winner ""Buttons and Bows"" - and sight gags!",1104278400,4,447,4.309523809523809
1210897,5,B00000FCYU,"Quite seriously (in a manner of speaking!) this is the best of all of Bob Hope's movies. Although the Road To.. films are classics and will forever feature in the Comedy Hall of Fame, this little-known gem is a real riot! This probably comes closest to Road to Utopia in terms of zaniness.
A sequel-of-sorts to the hugely inferior The Paleface, this movie lays it's cards on the table from the very beginning as we are introduced to the titular 'hero' through a very witty narration (""This girl has just the kind of lips I like to kiss - one on top and one on the bottom"") that includes the almost obligatory Bing Crosby cameo. Following this is a few minutes of plot development (and, strangely, this film has more plot than most straight westerns) before Junior Potter (Hope) bursts into town. Great one-liners abound (""I'm an innocent man and if you have any justice in you, you'll accept my bribe"") but the real beauty of the film is the surreal, almost cartoon-like direction. Of course the direction has every right to be cartoon-like - it's directed by Frank Tashlin who started in Hollywood directing Porky Pig! Wild action includes Hope's reaction to a Micky Finn, Hope's attempts to blend in with his cowboy costume, Hope and Trigger sharing a bed and talk (tastefully done!) and a crazy chase finale involving banana skins!
Supporting players Jane Russell, Roy Rogers and, of course, Trigger do extremely well in the shadow of Hope who pulls out all of the stops for a career-best performance. The songs, including Buttons and Bows with a twist, are great and the script, apart from the few straight seems which are kept to a minimum, compares well with the Marx Brothers at their best.
Don't believe me - watch it and see for yourself!",1090195200,10,1747,4.693811074918567
1210898,4,B00000FCYU,"SON OF PALEFACE is a sequel, of sorts, to Bob Hope's 1948 hit PALEFACE.  It reunites Hope with Jane Russell (Calamity Jane in the previous movie, Mike `The Torch' Delroy in this one.)  Singing cowboy Roy Rogers rounds out the lead roster as Federal Agent Roy Barton.
 Hope plays Peter `Junior' Potter Jr., a recent Harvard grad who travels west to claim his inheritance.  Russell plays a masked bandit and Rogers the Fed investigating a series of stagecoach holdups.  There's a search for a cache of gold hidden by Junior's father but beyond that the plot doesn't get in the way much at all.  If it did, you'd wonder how the masked Torch is able to keep her identity a secret.  Yeah, she's wearing a mask, but the hip-hugging jeans and tight blouse she wears when a-robbing make it kind of obvious who it is under the mask.
  Not that it matters much.  The plot is just thick enough, thank you.  Russell and Rogers play it straight and provide Hope with strong foils to play against. By 1952, when SON OF PALEFACE was made, Bob Hope had the blustering coward schtick down cold.  Teamed here was director and former Warner Brothers animator Frank Tashlin things get a little wacky.  Non sequiturs, snappy one-liners and mugging close-ups are the rule here.  Tashlin throws in some very cartoon-y gags, as well.  Hope drinks an impossibly tall drink in a bar.  After a moment the pipe he's smoking straightens out and spits fire.  The H on his Harvard shirt curls.  The pipe curls and his nose is caught in the bowl.  Smoke hisses out of Hope's ears.  His head spins rapidly, then his body.  His head sinks into his coat and his hat covers the neck hole.  Russell lifts the hat and peeks in....
  You get the idea.  It's all good family fun with just a scene or two that might zoom past the uninitiated.  For instance, when Hope drives his roadster across the desert two vultures perch on the rumble seat.  At one point Hope turns on them and says ""Hey!  Martin and Lewis!  Beat it!""  Fortunately, the visual and verbal gags come at such a rapid-fire rate we aren't forced to mull over such mysterious references.  Before we're given a chance to think about it Hope has driven through an ice-rink desert mirage and the vultures have changed into penguins.
  SON OF PALEFACE is one of those rare movies that will appeal to almost everybody and offend almost nobody.",1089504000,9,2362,4.574162679425838
1210899,5,B00000FCYU,I've never seen the original film but used to catch this one alot on tv when I was a kid. I am a HUGE Jane Russell fan and enjoy the silly humor presented here in this film but truly got it for Jane Russell. She looks good in the film and that is a very dim witted reason to REALLY enjoy this film but it's the truth. I think its a good silly romp for the whole family and for anyone who can laugh at Bob hope. It was alot funnier as a kid of course but it's good if in a silly mood.,1082851200,3,483,3.6538461538461537
1210900,5,B00000FCYU,"I bought this dvd for my father for Father's Day, and decided to watch it myself. I loved it as did my 4 year old daughter. The picture and sound quality are fine. Bob Hope is very funny, but I think Trigger the wonder horse steals the show! Trigger dances, fights with Bob over the covers, and just generally one ups Bob at every turn. If you want to see why Roy Rogers loved this horse, watch this movie. Great for the entire family.",1055635200,8,435,4.190476190476191
1210901,5,B00000FCYU,"of cinematic brilliance was in this blissfully cartoonish western spoof. Bob Hope geeks it up , sharing leading man stat with Roy Rogers, while Jane Russell is mesmerizing as fiery chanteuse criminal. Luminous, alive and flowing with colors.",1019692800,5,241,5.368421052631579
1210902,5,B00000FCYU,"The Brentwood DVD is an excellent way to watch this fun comedy. The picture is razer sharp from 35mm, and the colors are pure and brilliant. I wondered about the low price but the quality is there! And the movie is great, as the other reviewers had said.",994464000,23,254,4.3125
1210903,5,B00000FCYU,"Maybe because I saw ""The Paleface"" after I saw ""Son,"" I couldn't help but find the latter to be a much more satisfying and entertaining film.  Bob Hope, in his inimitable style, is aptly sarcastic, witty, bumbling, crafty, and just plain funny as the son of the character from the original.  Jane Russell seems to parody the sexy image of which she was so famous.  Roy Rogers enjoys being the brunt of some of Hope's jibes about the cowboy's ""squeaky-clean"" persona. Technicolor has never made Trigger look better.

A great enjoyment for the entire family is this classic farce.  Mel Brooks must have been influenced when he made ""Blazing Saddles"" decades later.",971654400,27,662,4.875

1210986,5,B00000FCYU,"The 1953 Western comedy ""Son of Paleface"" starring Bob Hope and Jane Russell is a sequel to the 1948 film ""Paleface"", also starring Bob Hope and Jane Russell.
Two of Hope's funniest films.
Weird:
In ""Paleface"" Bob Hope marries Jane Russell
In ""Son of Paleface"" Bob Hope, playing the the son of himself and Jane Russell, marries Jane Russell.
I'm surprised the censors didn't notice.
""Son of Paleface"" is presented in glorious Technicolor on the new Kino Lorber blu-ray.
Written and directed by Frank Tashlin, who had only recently made the transition from being a writer/animator/director for Warner Brothers Cartoon division.
There are a number of examples in ""Son of Paleface"" where Tashlin's cartoon training takes over.
- @ 36 minutes into the film, just after the song ""Buttons and Bows"", Bob Hope drinks a highly alcoholic ""Paleface Special"" with side-effects straight out of Looney Tunes.
One of Tashlin's final animated shorts, ""The Lady Said No"" (1946) is included as a bonus.
Unusual in that it uses puppet animation, not drawings (released by Daffy Ditties).
Kino Lorber includes full-length audio commentaries for both ""Son of Paleface"" and ""The Lady Said No"".
Only regret: No subtitles.

""Paleface"" has not (yet) been released on blu-ray. In the meantime, here is a link to the DVD:

BUTTON & BOWS
The song ""Buttons and Bows"" was written for ""Paleface"", where it was sung by Bob Hope.
It won the Oscar for Best Song of 1948
(""East is east and west is west, and the wrong one I have chose."")
The song is repeated in ""Son of Paleface"" sung in a trio by Jane Russell, Roy Rogers and Bob Hope.
The lyrics are altered in several places, and a lot of comedy shtick is tossed in.

BOB HOPE'S WESTERN COMEDIES
Bob hope actually starred in a total of five Wild West comedies.
In addition to ""Paleface"" and ""Son of Paleface"", there were:

-- ""The Road to Utopia"" (1946) co-starring Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour.
The fourth of seven Road pictures with Hope and Crosby, set during the Alaska Gold Rush of 1896.
(great ending - the censors were asleep at the switch)
Not on Blu-ray, but part of an economical two-DVD set of Road movies:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bob-Hope-and-Bing-Crosby-Road-to-Comedy-Collection/dp/B008M4C1BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road to Comedy Collection</a>

1210992,4,B00000FCYU,"Grew up a big Roy Rogers fan.  Most of Roy's western films have not aged gracefully and if anything seeing Roy and Trigger in supporting roles in beautiful Technicolor is a delight. Jane Russell also plays a great impression of her seductive self.  The film is actually a star vehicle for Bob Hope as a sequel to the highly successful The Paleface.  If you're not familiar with Bob Hope, you might find his often self-effacing humor silly now,  but it can still be good fun.  The sequence where Bob sleeps with Trigger is still classic.  Recommended.",1481414400,4,550,4.677083333333333

I saw it years ago and had forgotten  the plot and most everything except for the wonderful Roy Rogers.  I was not disappointed after all these years.  I've watch it several times to see Roy and his singing, and that wonderful horse Trigger.  Pure entertainment.  Oh yes, Jane was just great.  Love the saloon act with her singing and Roy's too.  This was a Roy Rogers movie and Bob Hope was just an extra to make the story line work, as far as I'm concerned.",1454889600,,586,4.245454545454545

Colors are seriously out of register in many scenes.  This tells me there has been no effort at restoration of the film.

1211122,3,B00000FCYU,"Along with the Road series of movies, Bob Hope is best known for  The Paleface and Son of  Paleface.  Critics love this movie, but I consider Son of Paleface far inferior to The Paleface.  The plot does not measure up to the plot of The Paleface.  In the Paleface the viewer could understand why Jane Russell falls in love with Bob Hope and marries him.  You understand why the Bob Hope character becomes a hero.  In Son of Paleface only a total idiot would marry Bob Hope.  Jane Russell does.  Bob Hope plays a character that the average viewer cannot like.

Roy Rogers is a charming addition and the few musical moments were somewhat entertaining but I don't get what this film was supposed to be. It's named Son of Paleface thus saying that it is a sequel but the storyline doesn't line up then. And if it were a remake of the original Paleface, then it completely falls flat in that department. The plot isn't very good and the chemistry wasn't there with Jane's character and Hope's which is what one would expect from the 2 main characters. It wasn't even entertaining enough to keep me awake past the first 20 minutes during my first viewing. And the second time I tried to watch this, I turned it off after 45 min. I LOVE old Hollywood films and Bob Hope but this was a huge disappointment. If you want to see a GREAT and charming Hope comedy watch The Paleface.",1309305600,3,942,4.388571428571429
1211172,5,B00000FCYU,"Paramount Pictures presents ""SON OF PALEFACE"" (1952) (95 min/Color) -- Starring Bob Hope, Jane Russell, Roy Rogers, Bill Williams, Lloyd Corrigan & `Trigger'

Directed by Frank Tashlin

A sequel to Bob Hope's 1948 box-office success The Paleface, 1952's Son of Paleface is a superior product in every way, thanks largely to the spirited, creative direction of Frank Tashlin.

Peter `Junior' Potter (Bob Hope) is a Harvard-educated dude who heads West to claim the inheritance left him by his gunslinger father. Much to his chagrin, Junior discovers that his dad has left him nothing but debts. To stave off Potter Sr.'s angry creditors, Junior pretends that his father has salted away a fortune somewhere in the hills. This arouses the attention of curvaceous saloon owner Mike Delroy (Jane Russell), who doubles as a mysterious masked bandit known as The Torch. Meanwhile, federal agent Roy Barton (Roy Rogers) keeps tabs on Junior, hoping that he'll lead him to The Torch and her gang. True to form, ex-cartoonist Tashlin fills the screen with a wealth of inventive sight gags and inside jokes.

Hope & Russell get to reprise of The Paleface's Oscar-winning ""Buttons and Bows,"" this time performed with the help of Roy Rogers.

Best scenes in Son of Paleface involve the smartest horse in the west, Trigger, constantly outsmarting Hope

A side splitting film. Bob Hope's wisecracking persona and writer-director Frank Tashlin's cartoon-like gags make a perfect blend. And anyone who enjoys Jane Russell has to check out her opening shot in the movie, in which the camera pans up her gorgeous legs while the band plays on, with Hope and Rogers looking on.

Oscar nominated for Best Song (""Am I in Love"")

1211174,5,B00000FCYU,"Yes, it's comedy from another time. Yes, a couple of the gags/lines by Hope may not be P.C. by today's standards... so who cares? This is campy fun so turn it on, sit back, and relax enjoying some stars of the big screen who are no longer with us as they play together in this slapstick classic.

The color is outstanding. Jane Russell looks absolutely ""va-va-voom!"" gorgeous in her various wardrobes no matter what she is wearing throughout the film. She's the villian with a heart that you'd love to tame, and watching Hope try throughout the film is a joy. Roy Rogers obviously had a lot of fun in his role, too.

Bob Hope is obviously the star here. His outfits are hilarious, and the continuing ""Harvard man"" gags are terrific. His movies consist of scenes that go from one funny & ridiculous predicament to another, and this one follows that formula just fine. As king of the one-liners, the ones he delivers here are classic.

It all seems like innocent fun, something lacking in today's so-called comedies. It is at times a campy farce which makes it all the more appealing. This one has repeated viewings written all over it. Enjoy!",1270166400,,1141,4.610837438423645

1211196,5,B00000FCYU,"I won't repeat the rave reviews for ""Son Of Paleface"". But if by some chance you've never seen this classic film, you've missed out, especially if you like Bob Hope and his silliness.

An all star western cast and excellent writing and acting make this a hilarious slapstick romp. Roy Rogers, Jane Russell, Bill Williams, and Hope; all are at their peak and the DVD is of excellent quality.

Like most everyone else here is saying, if you like these types of movies already, you'll enjoy this one, over and over again.

After viewing it with an 'adult eye', it stands the test of time. Hope performs like a true Vaudivillian. It's a laugh a minute. Jane Russell and Roy Rogers are a good supporting cast. And I believe it was Roy Rogers best role. Too bad that he was the cowboy who never kissed the girl. He had the potential to be a real romantic lead, which the film bears out.",1227571200,,484,4.0
1211200,5,B00000FCYU,"It's like watching a cartoon comic but with real human actors! A very funny movie. Another reason why the humour is so intense is because the funny things that happen take place within a rather serious plot, so the humour comes when you least expect it.
