7977555,3,B00007KK33,"Well, this is about what I excepted a typical  movie from the early 1970s. It was fun to watch old times. As for the movie it was not great and the title was deceiving. It had little to due with Private Duty. There were three student nurses who had their own little plots inside the flick. There is a little nudity inside the flick. I guess for that time it was probably considered a lot. The acting was not great and neither with the script, but I guess what do you expect from a movie made in 1970s. Overall, not sure if I would rent this if I had a chance to do it all over again.",1387497600,5,583,3.982905982905983
7977556,4,B00007KK33,"Almost.  Here's why.
1.  The Black Man was being held down by the White Man.  Until he & his friends went into the White Man's place of business, kicked him out by threat of violence, staged a sit-in until their demands were met & used the WM's resources to accomplish his goals.
2.  The Black Woman was being held down by the Black Man.  Until she agreed that was the right thing to do, be oppressed & support her man until such a time that he didn't feel oppressed by the WM & it was her turn to be freed.  Actually, outside of the BM having to use force for her to see his side of things, it was a nice side story.
3.  Pollution.  It sucks & killed someone in the movie.  But don't feel bad cause he wasn't a nice to to begin with.  That & it wasn't just pollution that killed him.
4.  Copy was too dark in some places to see anyone.
Outside of that, I really enjoyed the flick.  War is bad.  Riding a motorcycle is cool but can be dangerous if done wrong.  Nice looking ladies.  & some douche with a water bed & no bed play skills.  That was funny, just not for the girl.",1358208000,,1075,4.0
