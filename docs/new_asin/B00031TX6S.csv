2155672,5,B00031TX6S,"I cannot add much to the awesome reviews that are already in place - however I will add my own personal experience with the the Please! franchise.

Please Teacher is not your normal sort of story - what hooked me years ago when I first watched this was the science-fiction elements that the creators have blended in so well with a romance story. Most of the characters are extremely likeable, and all throughout the show it does pull on heart strings.

The ending is brilliant - and the OVA is an added bonus!

One of my all time faveroutes in terms of maturity and relationship issues. As a guy, this was quite painful to watch in places - but we all have emotions, don't we? ;)",1340755200,,679,4.373015873015873
2155673,5,B00031TX6S,"i didn't buy this anime, but a friend of mine has it, and when i first met him, we were at his house and watched it. i absolutely LOVED it. and for those reviews saying, ""its horrible, don't buy it, it doesnt have the sex ur looking for!"" those aren't anime for tv, like this show is. now if u aren't a romantic type of person, and just want to try it, search for it on google, and if u like it, this is by far worth buying :) its one of my favs:) and although i don't remember the end, there was a somewhat inappropriate for tv spot, but other than that, its almost any age approriate, so unless ur super crazy and don't let kids watch anything that has romance, its an anime for the whole family, especially the teens.",1314057600,,720,4.077464788732394
2155674,5,B00031TX6S,"I will not go over what has been said be other people.  A story about a young man who has a disease that makes him fell like he is out of a different time.  A chance meeting near the lake with a young woman from outer space.  And when the young woman becomes his teacher, this starts the wheels moving forward.  When he learns of her secret and he tells her of his secret, what else is there to do, so he marries her (its okay, he is 18 and she is an alien).  As the new couple start their new lives together they learn that not everything is golden.  And when a classmate tries to steal Kei away from Mizuho, the two of them must learn to trust each other so their love and marriage will develop even when things look the darkest.

This is a true legend of anime, if you are looking for a more adult driven series keep looking (of course episode 13 is more adult than the rest of the series, and very funny).  This is a well written story, with good humor, and good characters.  I also enjoyed the manga as well and while there were a few changes to the story (especially with the relationships of the friends) it stayed true.  a must have for any collection.",1304899200,,1160,4.138392857142857
2155675,4,B00031TX6S,"When I tell the plot to this show it might as well be any other boy-aimed romantic comedy (such as Ah my goddess, Love hina, Midori days etc, etc) they're not all bad but for most people it's ""seen one, seen 'em all"", So why watch this romantic comedy?

So basically the Anime begins with an alien having to come to earth to learn about both humans and about herself by becoming a teacher in a typical, peaceful little town but a some what geeky yet sweet boy who suffers from a rare illness happens to discover her identity, with either being sure what to do they confront each other but are found alone talking by the school principal who jumps to the conclusion that their seeing each other. Now the boy, Kei, who doesn't want his new teacher fired and obligated to go home from earth has to come up with an excuse, the excuse? That him and his teacher, Mizuho, are actually married.
So one thing leads to another and Kei has found himself living with his teacher and alien-wife as life get's crazier and crazier with a tun of colorful character and miss understandings while he tries keeping his secretlife a secret.

So basically Onegai teacher sounds, looks and over all starts out like a beautifully drawn yet pretty clich romantic comedy, but that is just the surface. What your actually getting in to is not the usual bishoujo romcom- with great belly laughs, angsty guys, sexy women and pretty predictable and repetitive plots and drama.
What your getting in to is a much more plot driven, fast paces, honest and relatable then it is funny, sexy and over the top (not that it wasn't all of those things too!).

What you basically watching is the question; how complicated has love got to be to not be worth it?
And with a love where every little thing goes wrong and misunderstandings await Kei pretty much where ever he goes the series gets dramatic and touching ad does it surprisingly fast since this show moves fast enough, which I really like.
This isn't the series where the guy tries to kiss the girl for 50 episodes of filler, but the story when the couple finally kisses doesn't mean happily ever after, there's still secrets, friends, sex and having respect and confidence in yourself while trying not to hurt others, and it isn't easy and it's how life often tends to be like.

So I'll tell you this show is plot driven, well paced and relies on likable characters and good drama with some deep thoughts on relationships and love............ compared to other anime of its genre. That's right, as much as I've praised this show that's only in comparison too other shows, because compared to them I really think this show is on a whole other level, but take it outside of it's genre it ain't a master piece.
For what it is though I can easily say it's my favorite show of this genre it's short, sweet and to the point.

As for the art and animation - very nice everything looks very pretty and the character all look fairly different from one another. And the same can be said about the music, not my favorite score but nice.
The voice work however isn't perfect in either language, there is little to complain about in the Japanese voiceover, it's good but not that all that special. In English dub Mizuho and Koishi  both sound wonderful but they're the only ones, everyone else is pretty average.

So in conclusion, if your like me and would like a romantic comedy anime without the lack of development and slow pace, then this is well worth checking out and if you are a fan of romantic comedies to begin with, then check Please Teacher out out.",1284940800,,3569,4.524031007751938
2155676,1,B00031TX6S,"I purchased this series because someone on amazon.com recommended it to me.  I took their advice because I really enjoyed reading his review on Elfen Lied.  He said if you liked Elfen Lied you would enjoy this series.  He was wrong I really did not feel anything like I felt when watching Elfen Lied.  Now if you like anime are perverted and have the sexual maturity of a 15 year high school boy then this is the series for you.  This series is basically the dream of every high school boy with a hot teacher.  I have been there and I am sure that may of the males reading this review have been there as well.  Anyways if you want a series with a good storyline then this is not for you.  The writers who wrote the script need to get another job because script was mediocre to say the least.  I spent 27 dollars on this series with shipping and I might as well have burned the money.  I could write a better storyline than this one in less than a month in fact I have no doubt I could.  I'm just saying it would be best to spend your money on something else rather than this series.  I hope this review was helpful and if you do decide to purchase this series don't say that nobody warned you.

2155677,1,B00031TX6S,By far this was the lousiest movie I have every watch of Anime. Please do not buy this item it really is a waste of money if you are looking for reguler amine movies with sex. This movie really should be taken off the Adults only viewer list or trashed completely is the best place. A 2 hour movie with bad scripted and confussing scenes.,1274400000,,338,4.2153846153846155
2155678,5,B00031TX6S,"I'm sure that most everything has been covered in the reviews here. This isn't Dragonball, Shuffle, or Air TV. I've been exploring Anime for a while. You can see some of my other reviews if you like. As far as stories go, I like my love stories sentimental and corny. I think sometimes we could use a little more of that. This show isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend that if you're a parent that you watch it yourself before you let anyone under 13 watch it, especially episode 13. It's a little too racy for the very young, but it isn't over the top like Hentai or anything like that. It's an older woman younger/man love story. Kei is technically a man, being 18 years old--even though he's pretending to be younger in order to fit in at school. Miss Kazami is 22 as I remember, so it's not that far fetched. My wife is very nearly ten years younger than I am. It just so happened that they came up with a clever way to explain that within the confines of the story.

The bottom line is, that I set my sense of reality aside when I watched this. Watching anime is meant to take you away from reality on a little trip no and again. This one was an enjoyable one and it kind of reminded me of Weird Science, and Mannequin and all those other feel good 80s movies we're so fond of. Sure, the story doesn't stand up to close scrutiny but again, that's not why I chose to watch it. It made me smile, and that's the important thing. I definitely enjoyed the trip.",1267401600,,1485,4.22887323943662
2155679,5,B00031TX6S,"If your a fan of Anime than the things that could be called short comings are probably pretty standard aspects of most romantic series. I personally love nearly every single thing about this series The only thing I don't like about this series is how short it is 12 actual episodes and a bonus much racier 13th Episode.

Its a very romantic show I personally recommend it to anyone who is interested in romance and anime. A Must Buy in my opinion.",1259712000,,447,4.451219512195122
2155680,5,B00031TX6S,I have first initially thought this would be some full on hentai. But really its a romantic comedy that does have a strong story that makes you just want to play the whole series in one go. I wish the series was longer as this was a great anime and a must have for all collections. Great intro music if your into tacky Japanese love songs. And great character development.

2155684,5,B00031TX6S,please teacher yes i know i know it sounds like some kind of hentai porno but thats where ur wrong its actually one of the most beloved anime series ever. this anime is pure greatness the only problem is its too short that its i swear u will love this anime the character design is awesome its so freaky how well u can relate to the characters and understand what each one is going thru there development is the main keys to this anime success each character has a meaning unlike other animes. the storyline is kinda omg i wished that happened to me and at the same time ur thinking theres no way in hell that will happen to me lol. okay our man guy is a teenaged boy name kei kusanagi whos suffer from a mental ill called standstills who happens to find an beautiful lady one night while he was out. who happens to be his teacher and happens to be the woman he marrys yes i know lucky bastard right....well its not all peaches and cream kei has to go thru alot its kinda of hard being married to your teacher and have to hide the fact that u live with her from your friends and on top of that she's an alien.well i don't want to give away to much so u should go cheack this one out on your own k XD.,1219622400,,1200,4.046218487394958

You see this boy who has standstill and this girl who is half human and half alien. The boy at a lake and the girl shows up and turns this boys life upside down. He married her and living together but noone at school knows about it. Oh yeah I forgot to mention it's his teacher. The boy is 18, but he looks 16.

2155686,5,B00031TX6S,"I bought this show thinking it was going to be slightly entertaining since I got it for so cheap.  I'm in Afghanistan and needed something to watch.  I loved it.  I watched it 4 times already.  The show seems to be serious, but should be a comedy at the same time.
You got an outlandish group of characters in a serious setting that all seem innocent in their own way.  I was glad that they weren't all serious because that made the show a great watch.
You got Kei who has these ""stand stills"" which is a way he falls asleep and doesn't age at all.  It's like some type of hipnotic trace that he keeps away from all the people that are around him.  In the story there is very dramatic sequences that help the story along.  I find it to be important too because the symbolic implications of what goes on with that.
Kei then marries his teacher at the beginning of the story.  It was orginally so that she could keep her job and not tell her secret of being an alien/Earthling.  Then they live together, but have to hide the secret of being married from everyone.  That allows for alot of hilarious concept and some good drama.  Especially in the honeymoon episode.  The show wasn't meant for Macho guys though.  It is one for anime fans that love a good story with outlandish characters though.  I only complained about one thing though.  The sequel has nothing to do with this story.  I felt there was alot more to tell in the story and they went in an all new direction for the sequel.  So try not to be disappointed when after 13 episodes they story is over and you want more.",1214611200,,1578,4.291525423728814
2155687,1,B00031TX6S,"if you are an adult male, who is NOT lonely, you will be sorely disappointed with this anime.  reading the glowing reviews, i purchased this set with no idea what it was going to be like.  but, so many positive reviews couldn't be wrong, right?

unfortunately, i have to dissent with the other reviews.  the characters are very very cliche:
1.  quiet, introspective, nice boy just looking for love
2.  lovely, willing to please, ""needs to be saved by a man"" trophy woman
3.  annoying filler characters (mostly females that secretly or not so secretly desire the hero)

the plot is paper thin... really, it doesn't matter.  sexy female alien comes to earth...  well, clearly, most reviewers were had at ""sexy female.""  so, the episodes were really just set situations where comedy, sexual tension and misunderstandings could occur.  problem was that if you've seen any other harem anime, it's the same gags.  for example, another woman accidentally falls on top of hero and the heroine walks in.

each episode seemed to drag for me and at times, it got quite talky.  long discussions of his seizure-like episodes and what kinds of emotional stress causes them.  so, it has moments of attempted profundity.  to me, it came off as mostly whining.

the final episode was clearly for fans... extra gratuitous sexual content (nothing blatant, but enough to titillate.)  actually, that was the best episode as it was just trying to be funny.

i didn't like Love Hina (3 stars from me) that much either... but, that anime is brilliant compared to Please Teacher.  i love anime, but not this type.  if you're curious about harem anime, i'd say go get Love Hina as at least, that has more humor.

pros:  only 13 episodes long and good animation.
cons:  everything else... i'd give this 1/2 star if i could.

--
update:  as i had ordered Please Twins at the same time, i dreaded watching that set as i read that they are related.  however, i can't believe how much better Please Twins is and i'd give that anime 3.5 stars.  Please Twins is much funnier and lighthearted.  the end of the series begins to drag a bit, but overall, a nice short series.",1211932800,3,2138,4.684636118598383
2155688,4,B00031TX6S,"I picked up this collection at an anime convention a few years ago out of curiousity. A friend had recommended it to me and I figured that I'd give it a try.

The story of alien girl meets boy isn't a new one, but the little extras are what makes this story unique. What makes this series so good is that not only is the high school boy subject to a mysterious disease that causes him to fall into a coma & not age, but the two characters don't spend a lot of time dancing around each other. They are pretty clear of their feelings after a few episodes (they just hide it from everyone).

Would I recommend this to a friend? Sure. It's a nice sci-fi romance that has a surprisingly strong slice of life feel to it.",1211932800,,714,4.129496402877698

There are many serious notes, too, as well as some philosophical themes underlying the pure randomness of the situations. If you're looking for a ""high-school boy meets alien and then has the most random adventures in life and love"" sort of series, this is it. From the first time I saw it, I was hooked.

  In this series Kei has to deal with a wife, who in my opinion is one of the best female anime characters i have ever come accross, his friends at school and a disease that stops him in his tracks, literally!  At first Kei and Mizuho don't know how to act around each, both are a bit shy and unknowing of each other.  As time passes both come to the reality of their relationship.

I seem to see this recurring theme in the anime I have picked up lately...

Pretty simple plot but executed pretty well...  I liked it...",1177113600,,339,4.25
2155697,5,B00031TX6S,"Okay, first of all I think some of the plot devices in the story that the anime conveys are rather weak. The ""standstill"" sickness the protagonist suffers from left me dreaming that he was crying out, ""It's not a plot device! Really, it isn't! It's a very serious medical condition that I suffer from, honest!""

... Right ...

The ""my teacher is an alien"" concept and, more importantly, the way it was implemented is kind of sketchy too. Worst of all is the way in which the co protagonists (Kei and Mizuho) were hitched (married - and this doesn't really count as a spoiler because they tell you everywhere). It was all very dodgy and seemed illogical (and thus created plot holes).

How do they combat these sketchy parts of the plot? Oh, by citing out 'fate' and destiny' of course. The ultimate free ticket for writers to do whatever the ---- they want and get away with it.

But forget about this questionable beginning. Just accept it and move on. It is the rest of the series you want to see. Following in the footsteps of the beginning is the middle and the end, the former of which is relatively coherent and the latter of which offers good plot resolution.

The themes of this story surprised me with the candor with which they address romantic and friendly relationships among young teens (and more speculatively, the relationship of an eighteen year old with his alien teacher). I enjoyed it, and I think most people will.

Episode 13 has sexually explicit content. It wasn't part of the original series, but was rather made at a later point. If you can accept such things from a 'cartoon', then rushing through the rest of the series as quickly as you can and watching this last OVA is a priority one!

2155700,5,B00031TX6S,"I've long held the opinion that no matter what sort of film or television shows you enjoy, there is an anime out there for you.  This is one of those series that proves my point.  I am far from being a fan of typical romantic comedy fare as that particular genre of entertainment is beyond stale and redundant here in America, but I have found that anime has so much more to offer than just sex, violence, fantastic sci-fi, and over-the-top slapstick humor.  There are some damn fine, truly romantic and touching stories in the anime genre, and this is one of them.  While ""Love Hina"" and other romantic-comedy anime series' have tempered their softer side with outrageous humor and outlandish characters to make their stories more, well, more anime-ish, ""Please Teacher"" shows remarkable restraint and -in spite of the teacher from outer space angle- keeps the sci-fi very light, the humor low-key and character-based, and takes a subtler approach to most of the characters that really helps to bring each of them to life.  The engrossing story features many plot twists that you would never expect since so many series are content to run in place for fear of upsetting their fanbases *cough*RanmaInuyasha*cough*.  One of the aspects of this series that really adds depth to the plot is the main character's unique ""disease"".  When Kei becomes sad, he enters a comatose state of suspended animation -sometimes for years at a time- where he goes into his own mind to escape from the sadness he finds in his life.  Through his experiences with his friends and, of course, his new teacher who through a bizarre set of circumstances he's forced to ""marry"" (Ms. Kazami, possibly the most charming anime girl ever) he learns that there is no happiness without sadness for contrast, and that even if he stands still the universe will keep moving without him.  These sorts of ideas and the way they are presented as integral parts of the story are what separate true classics from the throwaway entertainment crop.  It also doesn't hurt that the characters in the story are truly likeable.  Ms. Kazami's trademark phrase is hardly catchy (""This is priority one"") but her delivery of the line (in Japanese, anyways) makes it a pleasure to hear over and over, and don't get me started on her chocolate candystick habit. These sorts of minor nuances make the difference between the characters you enjoy and the characters you truly feel for.  The series ran for a far-too-short 12 episodes, but we are treated to a joyous epilogue that turns out to be the funniest episode of the whole series and really left me feeling happy that I'd given this show a try.  If you enjoyed ""Love Hina"", ""Ah! My Goddess"", or ""Chobits"", if you are looking for an anime that's both inspirational and humorous, if you've seen enough of the giant robots, killer ninjas, and obnoxious slapstick humor that pervades more typical anime, or if you just want to enjoy a sweet, romantic story with some feeling and depth, then this is exactly what you are looking for.",1167955200,36,3031,4.794625719769674
2155701,4,B00031TX6S,"This show is definitely different, and you get a sense of that from the packaging. What that package doesn't tell you is behind the questionable concept is a thoughtfully told story of two interesting people caught up in an unusual situation. Both of these characters, Kei Kusanagi and his teacher Mizuho Kazami are complex individuals, each with a secret that both brings about and also complicates their relationship. In spite of the unusual premise, this story is neither kinky nor simple. It's just two good people trying to adapt to each other. There are a lot of complex emotions at work here, and it's not necessarily the most fun I've had watching anime, but the whole story is so lovely, I left this series with a great feeling.
That said, I must acknowledge that the final episode was somewhat gratuitous, and sort of left one with the feeling of having gotten too much information. But I certainly wouldn't hold that against this wonderful show. It's not perfect, but I'd still call it a keeper.",1167696000,5,1006,4.787356321839081
2155702,4,B00031TX6S,"Bandai Entertainment has been well known for the Gundam series that they have brought to the United States.  Please Teacher is a good sider for the well known giant robot franchise.  It's got a great storyline that is comparable to Happy Lesson, except with one teacher.  The plot is alright for the story, and the character development is on par with standards.  The dubbing... however cute... is actually lackluster (at least the females).  Whoever dubbed the main character, though, has done a good job.  This is an anime executed perfectly for being a rush job (it seems as though the producers didn't take the time with the animation).

2155704,5,B00031TX6S,"For these series I have to say that it is truly very enjoyable. To make the long story short, it is about the relation of a young boy who falls in love with his female teacher and `vies versa' and the problems that they encounter. Additionally, it is getting very funny when they try to keep their relation as a secret.

Well, thing is that:

a) The teacher is an alien

b) Her mother had a relationship with his father

c) The alien nation will try at some point do stop the relationship and their relationship will be tested

d) The teacher's mother in contrast to the teacher, is very corny and not shy at all

e) The teacher has a little sister that resembles the little sister of the series called `Oh my Goddess' (if I remember the title correctly)

f) Having watched both shows, the present one and `Oh my Goddess', I can safely conclude that both shows have many similarities - referring to the basis of the storyline - but still both of them are unique in their own way

g) It is a teenage comedy and how teenagers act and react when they encounter their first love situation, how life is in school etc.

h) At some points the series imply sex and are a little bit nude (but still, over 12 year old children can watch the shows)

i) However (Spoiler Included!!!): In one of the last episodes the series show something like a soft sex scene between teacher and the young student (Personally, I would have no problem with that but it is up to parents to decide).

j) Overall, it is a very enjoyable and funny series, interesting, a mix of romance and drama. Personally, I liked the series a lot and that is why I can recommend the shows beyond any doubt.

k) With this price you get all the shows and it is cheaper than buying them separately.

As a `footnote', I preferred to write my review in a bullet-like style so that the reader will get easily a good general picture of the shows without giving too much away. I hope that I could help you.",1146787200,33,1953,4.30327868852459

2155707,5,B00031TX6S,"First let me make something clear: in order to like this series, there are a few things you have to accept. Such as, teenage boys have eyes, and find girls physically attractive.  And, that this story pretty obviously must have grown out of the memory of a high school boy fantasizing about his teacher.  And, Japanese writers sometimes are a little unrealistic with initial story setup, so just grit your teeth if the part where they get married seems a little contrived.  It's the rest of the story you want to see.

If you can get past these, you are going to experience one of the sweeter, and better written, love stories you will ever come across.  It starts out a romantic comedy, pretty standard ""magical girlfriend"" fare along the same lines as ""Oh, My Goddess"" , and just as you are getting used to that, a much more complex and mature tale sneaks up from behind you and grabs hold.

A couple notes: I am a parent, and became interested in Anime again from watching DVDs first before deciding whether my children should watch them.  I am not uptight about occasional nudity (a la Ranma 1/2) or ""suggested"" sex, but I do try to keep them away from situations where the sexual content is clear, or is central to understanding the story. For this reason, two warnings:

1) If you  are more restrictive than I describe, you probably don't want your kids to see this.

2) In any case, don't let your younger kids watch the last episode. It is actually an ""add-on"" OAV that wasn't part of the original TV series, and it isn't necessary for getting plot resolution. At one point, a high-school couple are clearly having a romantic get-away in a ""love hotel"", and another couple are clearly in a ""bondage, S&M"" situation, and another couple are clearly in a situation that would be statutory rape in the U.S.  A little too much information for pre-high-school children, even in my liberal opinion.",1125532800,164,1899,4.622023809523809
2155708,5,B00031TX6S,"Ok here's an anime that i can say is like one of my favorites.

Please Teacher is a romance comedy sort of thing, there's some misunderstandings, and sexual situations, that much i do know.

I got the Bandai Complete Collection, anyone who wants to get all of the dvd's and wants to save money on them, Well they should get this Please Teacher Bandai Complete Collection, because if you buy the 4 dvd's seperatly well.. that costs you bout...around $120 bucka-roonies. I do not reccomend this to people who get offended by partial nudity, and conversations about perverted things, no wonder why its rated 16up!, haha!, but its not a bad anime, i mean not like the H-anime's and what not. The english dub is amazing, i prefer dub over sub anyway!. Anywaysss! it comes with cool special features!!!, like videos of other Bandai Anime!, and video's of Please Teacher!, and gallerys, oh yea and much more. Please Twins is another great anime to look at, they didn't make any box sets for them yet, well japanese ones.. but thats the japan audio only ones, and they only sell them at like ebay and other anime stores that sells imported anime. Oh yea and guys and gals don't ever judge this anime by its cover, and pictures.. because you don't know what its like until you've seen it!, golly.., well i hope this review will be of some help to you peoples who are reading it!, haha bye!",1112054400,22,1380,4.560483870967742
2155709,5,B00031TX6S,"Being a big fan of the Tenchi Muyo and Love Hina series, I was recommended to check this anime out by a friend.  While those would be the best series for the romantic comedy genre, I would have to say that Please Teacher is well done too.

The animation is pretty well done, considering most mainstream animes that we see here in network TV in seem to be rushed and having fairly badly done artwork.  The characters grown on you as the series progresses.  You learn to feel for each one and sometimes get disgusted as some for foolish decisions that they've made.  Others have critized the plot of the anime, but if you really look it over, it's actually a wonderful story.  Certain plot elements seem to make so sense at first, but as the story progresses, they begin to fit into the mold of the story.  There aren't as many funny parts as other anime of the same genre, but the overall story did hit me emotionally in some manner.  Considering this is a romantic comedy anime, the plot isn't suppose to be completely fluid.

Seeing some negative reviews about this anime may scare some people, but please give this series a chance.  I know I did and I really enjoyed it.  My only real complaint about the series is that it's too short.  I really wish the series had the standard 24-30 that most collections do.  It seems that by the end, there could have been more stories to be told and that the characters had more room to grow.  I loved the series that I wish that it could have been longer and I hope to see a second series in the future.",1106524800,25,1544,4.334494773519164
2155710,3,B00031TX6S,"This is an adult review.

After reading all the positive reviews of this complete series of Please Teacher I must admit that I was rather excited to purchase it, and so I did.

Sure,it did have some funny moments to it, and without going over the basic story and what it is about(you could check the other reviews for that if you need more details) my general sypnosis is based on how great the storyline is and this one just doesn't stand out as anything but average, and what a disappointment!

Sure this series could have been great,it had the potential to be an outstanding series-but at the end of the day it wasn't.

Why??

I think basically it was because this series lacked a decent enough plot.

 It started off rather well and the idea behind this story sounded cool too-a teacher who was really an alien gets married to one of the students,wow!

Actually the first two DVDS in the series were quite good.

The characters developed really well over the series and were quite amusing in themselves yet the storyline let them down hugely-you'll have to blame the creators for that!

As for romance and love, there is a lot of lovey dovey talk between the two main characters, and for a while it is amusing, but then it becomes overused and that is when the plot becomes a bit thin...

When all is said and done, should you purchase the series yourself? Possibly. Teenagers might enjoy it a bit more, not to say all adults will not.

 Afterall every one has differnt tastes, but be warned this is nothing outstanding! It is NOT one of the best animes out there-I have seen a lot better.

If you are looking for something really funny and wonderful-check out Love Hina instead!

I Hope that has been some help.",1104192000,21,1716,4.490322580645161
