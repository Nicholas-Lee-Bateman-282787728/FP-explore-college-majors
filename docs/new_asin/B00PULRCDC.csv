8689261,5,B00PULRCDC,"This movie is a perfect example of how less truly is more. What is normally bad for most films for the director to jump ship from the project to never return to it again, for this one, it was a blessing. I can't imagine this movie being any longer because it doesn't need to be: at only 45 minutes, it tells us the entire story, and so beautifully. If it were any longer, the story would have dragged and it wouldn't have been as affective and moving. Stunning film, in so many ways.",1500422400,2,483,4.204301075268817
8689262,4,B00PULRCDC,"This rarely seen little gem of a movie -- which I first viewed more than half a century ago at a little hole-in-the-wall repertory movie house on Berkeley, California's Telegraph Avenue -- has been mostly out-of-print for several decades.  I've waited decades for it to be re-issued.  Now, at long last, it's out in a restored Blu-ray edition.

It was French director Jean Renoir's 1930s attempt in an early sound film to recreate the sort of idyllic, rustic scenes of country life along the Seine that were depicted by the more famous impressionist painter who was his father.  Because, with the coming of World War Two, he abandoned the film project before completion, and because the film had to be completed by others, it's not quite perfect.  But it's still a warm-hearted, delightful spritzer -- like a sip of chilled champagne on a warm, languid, summer's afternoon by the riverside.  The story structure is very slight and wispy -- but the mood of this short film will stick with you for years and make you wonder why.  Don't ask.  (It's magic.)",1473379200,4,1053,4.779005524861878
8689263,5,B00PULRCDC,This is a beautiful passionate and melancholy short film. It really couldn't have been made anywhere but France. It looks beautiful on blu ray too.,1445731200,5,147,4.92
8689264,5,B00PULRCDC,Love this little film.  Some of the B&W footage is stunningly beautiful. Digital can't compare when it comes to the visual depth and emotional essence of film.,1427241600,4,159,4.888888888888889
8689265,5,B00PULRCDC,Such a treat to see this film again. Not exactly action packed ----better than that.,1425772800,,84,4.666666666666667
8689266,5,B00PULRCDC,"This is not a review of the quality of the Criterion Blu Ray, but advance expert reviews have said that the restoration is superb.

I have seen the film. In response to another reviewer, would you say that a book's price should be based on it's length?
I guess Gatsby should have been sold at a very low price! And Stephen King books should all go for $35 and up!

This is a superb film and invites multiple viewings. I've been waiting to see it again and am thrilled that Criterion is releasing it.

The extras also look very special and may provide as much of a treat as the film.

Worth the $29 from Amazon? It depends on the value you place on the film and the multiple quality extras.
For me it's a bargain.",1422662400,15,712,4.213235294117647
8689267,3,B00PULRCDC,"I own several other Criterion releases of Renoir films, and I am proud to have each one in my DVD/blu-ray collection.  But asking $25-$40 for a 40 minute movie? Come on, $1 per minute! Yes, Criterion is renowned for outstanding special features, but it is the film itself that matters most, not the extras. Those for whom money is no consideration will no doubt love having another Renoir title, but if you're like me, and have a budget, getting this one is out of the question. Just wish more Criterion titles were affordable, like the recent Monte Hellman double feature release, $10 per film during the most recent BN sale. Even at half price, however, this particular Criterion offering would still be too expensive.",1420329600,7,720,4.806451612903226
8689268,5,B00PULRCDC,"Jean Renoir's incomplete 1936 masterpiece A DAY IN THE COUNTRY is finally being issued in the US for the first time, but Criterion's release also marks the first time viewers will see the film on the 1080p Blu-ray format. Thank you, Criterion!",1416614400,13,243,4.809523809523809
