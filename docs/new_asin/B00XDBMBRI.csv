7167182,5,B00XDBMBRI,I have all of the Midsomer murders and have enjoyed them all.  I would highly recommend this compete series to anyone.,1445385600,,118,4.619047619047619
7167183,4,B00XDBMBRI,I love this series. Somehow the writers keep you guessing right up to the end as to who did the dastardly deed.,1445126400,,111,4.090909090909091
7167184,5,B00XDBMBRI,Each episode a perfect evening's entertainment.  . . . .as long as we do not have to live in Midsomer.,1444867200,,102,4.1
7167185,3,B00XDBMBRI,"I received my copy on time Saturday a.m.  The new cast seems to be much stronger and I really like Gwilym Lee.  He really has a strong presence.  He is better looking on screen; very personable.  The episodes are very good.  Of course now, I do miss the older format.  Not a complaint mind you, just noting.  The questionable thing about the people of the villages?  Well,  they do not carry the snobbishness that was in the earlier part of the series with Tom and his sidekicks....SO......are these particular folks the lower class of the village society?  They sure don't ACT rich!",1444521600,,583,4.627450980392157
7167186,4,B00XDBMBRI,Miss the old team of chief inspectors. This team does not have the spark and are little on the boring side. Stories were okay but I'll play my old DVD of Midsomer  Murders.,1444003200,,172,4.212121212121212
7167187,1,B00XDBMBRI,I would like to return Midsomer Murders Series 16 because it was previously released in set 25  which I already have. Thank You Very Much. I have truely enjoyed this series and would like to get the next  one.,1442880000,12,209,4.333333333333333
7167188,5,B00XDBMBRI,This is a re-package of Set 25.  So check before you order it.  Acorn reissues episodes and calls them series.  Always check the titles of the episodes before ordering though.,1440028800,17,175,4.766666666666667
7167189,1,B00XDBMBRI,"I stopped purchasing Midsomer Murders once Jones was ""promoted"".  I do note that I already have a ""series 16""  (actually have 1 thru 24) so think it's confusing to suddenly start repeating series out of synch.  It seems like a deceitful ploy.  Have to be careful when purchasing British series that will change the number or the title but end up having either entire repeats of previously released episodes and/or episodes that were once included in one set but not another.  There seems to be an inconsistency also with the number of episodes in a set.  It can range from 3 to 5 depending on which ""set"" you purchase.  So what may look like a good price for a set may be because it has only 3 episodes instead of  4 or 5.  Buyer beware.",1440028800,30,737,4.4
7167190,5,B00XDBMBRI,"This 3-disc DVD or BluRay set has 7.7 hours of excellent mystery viewing.

The next Region 1 DVD release is called Midsomer Murders: Set 17. It is available on amazon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Series-17/dp/B00XDBMBVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders Series 17</a>. It's about time that the Region 1 DVD/BluRay releases match the numbers used in the Region 2 releases. It looks like it will finally be called Set or Series 17 whether you order Region 1 or Region 2.

""The Killings of Copenhagen"" is the 100th Episode of a great mystery series, and the last story in Set 25. For this special event, the episode takes us back to Badger's Drift, the village which hosted the very first Midsomer Murder, in both the TV series (1997) and Caroline Graham's first Inspector Barnaby mystery novel (1987).

Just before the start of Series 16, Sergeant Benjamin Jones (played by Jason Hughes), who has been at Barnaby's side from 2005 to 2013, was promoted to Detective Inspector. It's nobody's fault but Barnaby's, because he recommended the promotion. But as Jones has left Midsomer for Brighton, Barnaby needs a new sergeant. He gets DS Charlie Nelson. Young, active, and a city-boy who has to be introduced to village ways.

I think Gwilym Lee does a good job stepping in as the new sergeant. He isn't Jones, he doesn't try to be - he is someone new. If you've been a faithful follower of ""Midsomer Murders"" since the beginning (1997), you've had to get used to other changes. When Sergeant Troy (played by Daniel Casey) left in 2003, it felt very odd without him. When John Nettles retired as Tom Barnaby in 2011, I wasn't sure the show would survive. But in a stroke of genius, they didn't try to replace the actor playing Tom Barnaby, they brought in another actor as his cousin, John Barnaby. I love Neil Dudgeon in the series. After all, it's really the mysteries that keep me coming back to Midsomer.

A subplot of this series is the upcoming birth of the Barnaby's first child, including the travails of assembling a baby crib and the sympathetic yearnings of their doggy.

Because each show is 92 minutes long, there is time to tell a good story. The show is presented in 16:9 widescreen. English subtitles are available.

Episodes:
...1. ""The Christmas Haunting"" (2013 Christmas Special) The village of Morton Shallows has one claim to fame, which it proudly displays on the town sign: ""Most Haunted Village in England 2003"". But that's old news now, and there are some in town who desperately desire the tourist dollars that re-winning the Most Haunted award would bring in. So, in addition to ghost tours given by The Blacksmith Arms, the Manor House is having its first ""Fright Night"" tonight. The Manor ghost tour is lead by Pippa, who also happens to live in the Manor House with her parents. Participants are fitted out with recorders and other ghost-hunting accoutrements. and Pippa tells them: ""Spread out and use your equipment. We're looking for orbs, cold spots, knockings. And if we're lucky, the ghost of the blacksmith's daughter will appear.""
All lights are turned off, but before the tourists can even settle into their places, one giggling couple make a little detour into a child's bedroom for a little smooching. Which ends with one of them being attacked in the dark, pierced through with an antique sword. Well, what did they expect. Don't they watch any scary movies? They should have known the danger the moment they entered the dark room and saw the line of glass-eyed dolls looking spooky in the moonlight streaming through the windows.
...2. ""Let Us Prey"" Reverend Martha Hilcott has a problem. Her parish church, in Midsomer St. Claire, has a newly discovered medieval fresco in its crypt which could put her church on the map. But it's the rainy season and the nearby river is threatening to wash away her treasure. For people into medieval religious iconography, loss of the full-wall fresco of the haloed Jesus overseeing the punishments of the sinners would be tragic.
That's not really in Barnaby's bailiwick. But what does catch his attention is when a body is found at a weir on the swollen river. It is a woman with her head bound in a burlap sack. Drowned just like one of the sinners in the fresco. It gets even worse when a 2nd person is killed in another manner found in the fresco. Since the fresco shows a lot of sinners dying in imaginative ways, the serial killer has to be found quickly.
...3. ""Wild Harvest"" For a posh dinner, you can go to Wyvern House, set in the picturesque Midsomer country side. You could even see the next door neighbor, the farmer Martin Strickland slouch into the restaurant dining room, tracking with his workboots and leading his hound, and insolently ask for truffles. Before you discover what that was all about, you see Martin Strickland again the next morning. He had been tied to a tree and his stomach smeared with truffle oil. A wild boar ate his torso - while he was still alive. As he appears to have made five or six people angry, Barnaby has a surfeit of suspects.
...It seems 2014 was a good year for death by pig. It is also used in Season 2 of ""Father Brown"". As I wrote in my review of that DVD, I couldn't take it seriously at first. Then I googled ""pigs eat human"" and found newstories about it. It was even used in 2013 as a method of mob execution in Italy.

...4. ""The Flying Club"" It's the dead of night at the privately owned Finchmere Airport. One of the owners is working late in the control tower when he sees the cockpit light go on in his personal plane. He heads out to investigate (while at home you're saying, ""Don't go, Don't go"") and is rewarded for his curiosity by being hit on the head with a wrench. Then he's taken up in his own plane and his unconscious body rolled out over a lake.
When Barnaby investigates the next day, he notes two curious points. The wrench was not washed or hidden and the body wasn't weighted. So what was the message of the killing and who was the message for
...5. ""The Killings of Copenhagen"" (100th Episode of ""Midsomer Murders"") Eric Calder arrives in Copenhagen for a business meeting. When he checks into his hotel, he is surprised that there is a package waiting for him. He opens it to find an empty tin of his own biscuits. The tin reads, ""Calder's Golden Clusters"" and ""Greetings From Badger's Drift"". This sent a thrill up my spine immediately, as I recognized it as the locale of the very first Inspector Barnaby murder. Sure enough, murder is afoot, because the tin is covered in strychnine and Calder dies an agonizing death.
Barnaby and Nelson work with the Danish police to solve the crime. Not only was Calder a British citizen killed in Denmark, but the box containing the tin was franked from England. Not just England, but from the mail department in the Calder factory in Badger's Drift.
This episode is a perfect example of ""Midsomer Murders"" best - a mystery full of red herrings and psychological dynamics. It has fantastic secondary characters (which again, hearken back to the very first episode) in the form of Atticus and Ernest Bradley, smarmy and creepy.
It also is about children and parents; hopeful beginnings such as with the Barnaby's, messed up relationships, and finally redemptive 2nd chances.

Special Features on Series 16
From the descrption on this page, it looks like the Series 16 bonus content will be the same as on the Region 1 Set 25 release.
...a..""Gwilym Lee Interview"" (9 minutes) Gwilym sits for an interview on location. One of his comments: ""I think Barnaby misses Jones.... And [I'm] this little upstart comes from the city.""
...b..""Behind the Scenes"" (23 minutes) Commentators include Alex Pillai (director ""The Killings of Copenhagen""), Neil Dudgeon (in his ""bad"" Christmas sweater), Gwilym Lee, Birgitte Hjort Sorenson (plays Danish DS Degn) and Ann Eleonora Jorgensen (plays Danish DCI Poulsen), plus little bursts of interviews with other actors on sets/locations.
Dudgeon manages a straight face as he says, ""[Gwilym] is young and tall and thin and handsome. Apart from that I quite like him.""
Pillai notes that with 100 episodes, Midsomer County has had over 300 murders.
...c..""Celebrating 100 Episodes"" (17 minutes) For the 100th episode, they wanted to do something special. That turned out to be the show leaving England for the first time. Denmark was a good place to go, because ""Midsome Murders"" is very popular there, and Denmark has its own crime shows that are popularly shown in England.
...d.. Photo Galleries. There were three of them, at 2 minutes each, on Set 25.

7167213,2,B00XDBMBRI,"I am a Midsomer Murders fan and really give it a 5 star rating for content and acting.  The 2 star rating is to draw attention to a shoddy practice by Acorn for releases in the US.  The series numbers of the UK and US releases became out of sync very early on because the US versions did not contain all the episodes.  So two series in the UK became three series in the US.  The last series with John Nettles is series 13 in the UK but series 20 in the US.  So the series 25 US was equivalent to the series 16 in the UK (but which did contain the same 5 episodes).

However, for some reason Acorn decided to rerelease US series 21-25 as new US series 14-16.  They might claim this was to reduce confusion so the US now matches the UK series (confusion they themselves created).  But from comments by others it clearly resulted in people repurchasing episodes that they already have.  I guess the good news is that series 17 and later have not previously been released in the US (there was no older series 26!).",1478390400,5,1010,4.21875
