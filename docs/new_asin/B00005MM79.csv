1628003,5,B00005MM79,"I am an avid collector of Jet Li movies. I own all Jets martial art movies that he plays a major role in (not just like a 10 minute cameo)I owned the beverly wilshire version of the movie which has horrible picture and some of the subtitles are cut off, yet I still enjoyed the movie. Finally dragon dynasty has released this movie with wonderful picture and removable subtitles which make this movie even better. The action in this movie is incredible with fight scenes with like fifty guys. Even though the shaolin temple movies are Jets oldest movies they are some of his best. (Shaolin temple one and two were Jets first two movies and martial arts of shaolin was his 4th movie following born to defence) Make sure you buy the dragon dynasty version if you get this movie",1319587200,5,775,4.50354609929078
1628004,4,B00005MM79,"MARTIAL ARTS OF SHAOLIN (SHAOLIN TEMPLE 3) isn't the best of the lot, but it's got celebrated director Liu Chia Liang (a.k.a. Lau Kar-Leung) helming the thing, and a young Jet Li in front of the camera, so you can't exactly snub it. This film is a collaboration between the legendary Shaw Brothers studio - which in 1986 had run its course - and Mainland China's dynamic filmmaking sensibilities. Liu Chia Liang gets another crack at promoting the Shaolin monks, and he ably integrates his expertise of southern Shaolin kung fu with the prowess of Mainland China's foremost martial artists. I think it's worth eyeballing.

Why does young Zhi Ming (Jet Li), a pupil of a northern Shaolin temple, train so hard? Is it dedication to his craft? Yes, partly. But Zhi Ming also fosters a hidden agenda which comes to light when he learns of an impending event celebrating the vile governor Lord He Suo's birthday. It's always a trip watching these hotheaded protagonists in these Shaolin temple flicks studiously soak in the Buddha's peaceful philosophies only to see these lessons rapidly abandoned once a chance for a vengeful fighty fight surfaces. Years ago Lord He Suo murdered Zhi Ming's family. Now Zhi Ming sneaks out of the Shaolin monastery, his mind afire with grim thoughts of a reckoning. If nothing else, Lord He Suo deserves a painful and wretched death for his lame villain laugh alone.

During the festivities, our guy runs into Zhao Wei and Si Ma Yan, two martial artists but from a southern Shaolin temple and they happen to be likeminded would-be assassins of the depraved lord. But things go sour, the assassination attempt fails dismally, and Zhi Ming, Zhao Wei, and Si Ma Yan become fugitives. The rest of the film is essentially one long chase and fight sequence. To offset the action, there is a sub-plot concerning matching foot bells, the two bearers of whom are destined to be locked in an arranged marriage. When you consider that Zhi Ming wears one of these foot bells and that his Shaolin standing forbids marriage, well, it adds a measure of dramatic conflict.

MARTIAL ARTS OF SHAOLIN, released in 1986, features a Jet Li that was yet young enough and vibrant enough to pull off those mischievous roles. Even though his character intends to exact unfettered vengeance, there's still a playful side to him which allows for tomfoolery like covertly cooking snake meat and sneaking it into his monastery homies or inadvertently forfeiting a kung fu match against rival students. There's even a sequence in which Jet masquerades as a shepherdess to slip past soldiers at a check point, even as his fellow conspirators dress up as sheep in his flock. And, in case you're struck skeptical at a girl in this picture unconvincingly posing as a man, with everyone onscreen buying the deception, just roll with it. It happens to be a common trope in these films.

The film devotes the opening twenty minutes to establishing Jet Li's scamp persona, after which it proceeds to roll out the frequent fighty fights. As ever, Liu Chia Liang shows off his knack for choreographing crowded fight scenes, and the intricately-staged melee on the river has to be regarded as a career highlight. Jet Li unveils an attack comprised of a full body range of motion, and nowadays when do you see him treat an audience with Beijing acrobatics? And there's an awesome moment near the end in which Yue Hoi, who plays Jet's Shaolin master, uncoils his Mantis technique. It's probably my favorite moment in the movie.

All in all, a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one; it's a solid recommendation. MARTIAL ARTS OF SHAOLIN is pretty dang good. However. I can't quite put a finger on it, but there's something missing in this film, an absent element which keeps it from being an absolute classic. I do know my eyes were rolling at the tired rivalry between Zhi Ming and Zhao Wei. I wasn't down with the leisurely film score; I think it sabotaged the dramatic push of the story. And while I realize that lion and dragon dancing is a staple of the genre, the sequence here went on and on, much to the rapture of the evil Lord He Suo. It's another reason he deserves a painful and wretched death.",1314403200,2,4195,4.733242134062928

1628007,1,B00005MM79,"I was greatly disappointed, because the movie that I got recorded on the DVD was completely different then ""The Martial Arts of Shaolin"" although title printed on the box and disk itself was correct.

1628008,2,B00005MM79,"AKA Shaolin Temple 3, this movie is a decent display of Jet Li's kung fu prowess. If the version being offered is by Telefilms International / Beverly Wilshire Filmworks - buyer beware!  The film is NOT widescreen (as it says it is), and the subtitles are cut off by the formatting.  If you are a Jet Li fan like me, you will enjoy the action sequences, though they are sparse.  Creative stances and good moves from Jet save them.  I recommend this film to die-hard Jet fans ONLY - kung fu purists will be very disappointed.  Jet Li picks up his role as the orphan raised by Shaolin, his sifu from the previous two films returns as well.  If you like Jet, and like the series, go for it.  Not Jet's best, not his worst, either.  Picture and sound quality is poor.  Directed by Lau Ka-leung.",1013990400,22,790,4.3561643835616435

1628038,3,B00005MM79,"Jet Li stars in one of director Lau Kar Leung's (""Heroes of the East"") last films for Shaw Brothers studios.  This film is the 3rd in Li's ""Shaolin Temple"" trilogy but the first of the lot produced with the Shaws' involvement.  Neither of the films that followed the first are direct sequels but are similar in theme and personnel.

Jet plays Zhi Ming, a young monk whose parents' death at the hands of the cruel and ambitious Lord He Suo (Yue Sing Wai, ""Yellow River Fighter"") left him orphaned at the North Shaolin temple since infancy.  Despite plotting eventual revenge and being a bit mischievous he is a dedicated, caring and compassionate student.  However, upon hearing of a celebration in honor of the tyrant, Li decides it's time to settle the score.  Meanwhile, a young woman named Sima Yan (Wong Chau Yin, ""Kids From Shaolin"") will try and lead her own sneak-attack on the fascist oppressor with the help of her band of secular students from South Shaolin.

In the early '80s, the Shaws' studio still operated in Hong Kong but their target audience of fu-lovin' action-junkies began to move away from traditional flicks toward the new innovative filming and choreography style of old-school veterans like Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan, utilizing more contemporary settings.  Delegated to ""relic"" status, the Shaws continued to try and keep the homefires burning, with waning success.  At the same time, the old-school style was increasing in popularity on the mainland as the National Wushu team began making films starring their more advanced students.  While these pupils were not trained actors, they were incredibly talented martial artists whose energy and athleticism more than made up for their lack of thespian chops.  I suppose it was only natural for the Shaws and Master Lau to stick with what they knew best and arrange a cooperative crossover.

What makes mainland Wushu movies so generally enjoyable are the numerous fights, well choreographed and filmed.  It was certainly never the by-the-numbers plot!  The open, outdoor photography also helps distinguish the look and feel of these films from Shaw Brothers, who filmed mostly indoors with painted backdrops.  While I'm quite a fan of studio-filmed fare, the stunning picture quality available here gives us the best of both worlds with the Shaws' consummate movie-making sensibilities coupled with the breathtaking Chinese countryside.

I suppose in all my ramblings about the history of old-school kung fu I should probably mention that, on a whole, this movie is really not that great.  Not really sure why; it certainly isn't bad and, again, the fights are pretty good.  Fans of Jet Li who haven't seen any of his first few flicks may be pleasantly surprised by his spirited adroitness.  As enjoyable as most of his features of the last 20 years are, Li's physical prowess is probably the most victimized of any Hong Kong action star by post-production editing.  There are no such boundaries here to contain him.  Though I usually prefer straight hand-to-hand over weapons fights, I was slightly disappointed that Jet uses only his fists, as his weapons-hanling ability is 2nd to NONE!  Yet one would never know how quickly & effortlessly he yields a 3-section staff from the way his handling of it was filmed in ""Fearless"" (2006).  Too bad.

As with all of their releases following the departure of Bey Logan, this disc from Dragon Dynasty has NO special features but is endowed with the aforementioned crisp and luscious picture that Celestial has restored for the vast majority of the Shaws' library.  Excellent widescreen, too!  In Mandarin, with or without English or Spanish subtitles, or, if you prefer, English dubbed.  3.5/5.  Recommended for fans of old-school kung fu in general and for fans of Jet Li in particular.
