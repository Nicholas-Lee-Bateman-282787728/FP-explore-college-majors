This film was outstanding in every aspect, from it's humours moments, to the hearfelt sadness of the aftermath of the Chemical Attack by Saddam Hussein in 1985.

What make this film special is the extrodinary way Jano Rosebiani portrays hope, while surrounded by hoplessness, as well as an intimate understanding of just what a proud people the Kurds are!

Jiyan is a loving, funny, sad, and intelectual movie worthy of watching! It will make you feel alive!",1215475200,,658,4.857142857142857
