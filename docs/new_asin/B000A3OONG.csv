8074042,5,B000A3OONG,"Stuart Bull is an excellent teacher. Also a great player. Stuarty breaks the parts deown in a structured and meaningful manner, which gives you the ability to comprehend all of the lesson instead of random parts your brain will try to sort out, i.e. You learn the lick, but you can't remember the timing or melody of the lick, or the phrasings, which are so important. I highly reccomend this.",1412899200,,393,4.628571428571429
