We all lived in Fullerton,CA and the film gets it right - Bruce had courage enough to share. Adventurous, determined and wiry, his energy made him a standout kind of kid. Bill Brown, Fullerton filmmaker, obviously takes great care in his projects and did a masterful job on this story. At Captain Blood's Theater I had the opportunity to thank him personally for all the dedication and love he lavished on this movie. What can I say... see it.",1263859200,12,559,4.77319587628866
8221076,5,B00004U9PZ,"This is definitely a 'feel good' story. It is one the whole family can enjoy together. I highly recommend this for the younger crowd because it shows how a person can overcome unbelievable odds and still fulfill a dream. Nice to watch a movie without killings, violence and the seedier side of life.",1114560000,,299,4.660377358490566
8221077,4,B00004U9PZ,"An inspring movie depicting the possibilities that can happen in modern-day America.  Filmed in my hometown of Fullerton, CA this movie captures the hearts of common everyday Americans who just need a good flick to see on a Saturday night.  James Earl Jones, as impressive as usual, plays the character of an old retiree living in a convalescent home who inspires the main character ""Bruce Jennings"" to ride a bicycle from Fullerton, CA to Boston, MA in spite of his injuries from a motorcycle accident.  I reccomend this movie for high school athletes, and all other ambitious people who are willing to watch a great movie.",997747200,4,624,4.867924528301887
