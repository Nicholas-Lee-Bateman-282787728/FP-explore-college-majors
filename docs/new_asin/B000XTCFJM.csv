8229592,5,B000XTCFJM,...need one say more?  It is just fun to see him in something comic!  His usual work is often tragic.,1371340800,,101,4.0
8229593,4,B000XTCFJM,"Funny how I can't really get into too many rom-coms made in this country - but overseas is often a different story.  'He was Cool' is a perfect example of why; from South Korea, the story of tough-guy school bully Eun-Seong, and wimpy high school girl Ye-won, starts off badly when Eun-Seong - who goes to a vocational school - puts out an online threat to the ""dogs"" (what he calls the girls) of Ye-won's school to stay out of his area of town (the opening scene shows him actually fending some tough guys off such gals, but he's got the attitude that he wouldn't have to do it in the first place, if they stuck to their own turf).  Ye-won, incensed by the post, writes a snotty one back to Eun-Seong - immediately earning both his anger and threats of revenge.

In trying to avoid Eun-Seong, a bizarre ""accident"" actually ends up with her literally colliding with the guy, knocking him to the ground - and when it happens, her lips accidentally meet up with his in an unintentional kiss ... and from that moment, Eun-Seong and his buddies let her know that, as Eun-Seong has never even yet held hands with a girl, this accidental kiss now beholds her to him forever.

What follows is a bickering ""relationship"" that eventually sees an unwilling Ye-won having feelings for her bully - who already obviously is falling for her, but can't show it because he has this rep of being a bully/tough guy.  What ensues are the usual misunderstandings, jealous exes, etc. - and, as usual with Korean films, a couple of twists (one at the very end, especially) you don't see coming, that might have made for a bit of confusion early in the film, but ultimately give the film its heartbeat.

A light and fluffy rom-com on the surface, but as usual with Korean films this one has a couple of surprises, and a serious underscore about one thing, in particular, about Eun-Seong's past that gives both his character and the film an added dimension.  I can watch American-made rom-coms with my brain shut off, pretty much, but with Asian/Korean-made films in the same genre, I really like that there is always something behind the fluff; usually something that even brings a smile and tear to my eye, in the end.",1371340800,4,2196,4.572519083969466
8229594,4,B000XTCFJM,"Its cute and quirky. Song Seung Heon plays Ji Eun Sung, a high school bully. He's the leader of a small gang and is the best fighter around, aside from fighting though, he cannot stand to be touched. Jung Da Bin plays Han Ye Won, a very plucky girl. She stands up to Eun Sung and in the process accidentally kisses him.  He demands that she ""take responsibility"" for him and so sort of forces her to be his girlfriend.

As the movie goes on you can see that both of them are actually developing feelings for one another, but in a very clumsy way, so they end up hurting each other.  Slowly he tries to give up his bullying ways for her, but she doesn't realise it.

The movie has a lot of goofy, physical humor in it (the first time they meet face to face they are in a hair salon, he has a dye cap on while she has a perm treatment---and then they chase each other down the street, its a pretty great visual). It is also, has a neat bit of cultural stigma in it, from when it is set and explores what it was like to be that first generation of children growing up in a world with AIDS.

I really like the soundtrack of this movie too, same quirkiness as the visuals.

An enjoyable film that I'd say is mostly a comedy, some romance, some action and some drama.",1353283200,,1261,4.105691056910569
8229595,5,B000XTCFJM,"It was slow to get to the fun parts. but if you like Boys Over Flowers or Love*Com, then this is a dvd worth watching.",1258070400,4,118,3.76
8229596,5,B000XTCFJM,"I really love this movie, when will it be available to buy again? Im pretty upset I cant buy it. But anyway this movie is hilarious and so so cute. Very enjoyable :)",1234656000,5,165,4.03030303030303
8229597,5,B000XTCFJM,"This was the best and cutest romance I have ever seen! The main girl is hilarious and the lead guy is so cute and very charming. This flick makes american romantic comedies look incredibly lame.

5 STARS!!",1218844800,4,205,4.54054054054054
