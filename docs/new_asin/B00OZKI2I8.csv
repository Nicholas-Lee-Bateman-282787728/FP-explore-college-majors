6778704,3,B00OZKI2I8,"Loved it, hated it.  I'm a huge history buff, especially during prohibition and the gangster era.  I loved that the series was pretty true to historical accuracy and loved the costuming, not to mention the classic cars.

Unfortunately, the ending was grossly inaccurate, but I won't spoil it for you.  If you want to know how it REALLY ended, look up Enoch ""Nucky"" Johnson on Wikipedia - Johnson is the person that Boardwalk Empire's Nucky Thompson was modeled after.

I hated the unnecessarily foul language, the unnecessarily graphic sex scenes, and the almost ridiculously bloody violent scenes. There was quite a bit I had to fast forward through because it was too gross.  But then again, I guess that the American audience of today wouldn't watch anything tasteful,it's reflected in just about everything done today.",1509321600,,822,5.051851851851852

6778708,4,B00OZKI2I8,"The 1920s are one of my favorite periods in American history. Women finally won the right to vote. They discarded long dresses and bustles and started wearing form-fitting dresses that exposed their lower legs. They won the right to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, listen to jazz, and dance the Charleston. They became flappers and enjoyed themselves. However, it's easy to forget that the 1920s were also a period of organized crime. Al Capone was the most famous crime boss. This miniseries reminds us about the dark side of the 1920s.",1502323200,,538,4.988888888888889

6778736,5,B00OZKI2I8,"So, no - it's not really the Sopranos, but if they had lived in this era...This series is so well done.  They do a great job introducing you to the real life gangsters like Capone and Luciano as they weave the real with the fictional. The show is well cast and like Tony Soprano you just can't help but like Nucky Thompson and begin to empathize with him. Then he does something so heinous you begin to wonder how you liked his character, but then he's back to the good-hearted criminal you loved.  The background sets and furnishings are just as much a part of the ensemble as any of the characters. We just pause in mid-action so we can really take in the wallpapers and wooden furnishings and rugs. Just glorious.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boardwalk-Empire-The-Complete-Series-Seasons-1-5-Blu-ray-2015-Region-Free/dp/B00OZKI1KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boardwalk Empire - The Complete Series, Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray] [2015] [Region Free</a>] I have seen it now at least twice, and am more than happy to watch it again because there is always some other nuanced phrase or foreshadowing or amazing set that you see something new and different in.",1493769600,3,1196,5.494565217391305

6778741,4,B00OZKI2I8,"The import is region-free and a lot less expensive than the American set, but not much thought went into the box.  Discs are loosely slotted into folding cards for each season and aren't very secure.  If you just want to get all 5 seasons, put it on a shelf, and handle it carefully, this is the best value, but if you will be taking it anywhere on a regular basis, pay more for the region 1 set with decent packaging or get a case for transport for this one.",1492214400,4,459,4.146067415730337

6778796,3,B00OZKI2I8,"Let's start with the positives.  I thought the first season was great overall.  I enjoyed being transported back in time to early 20th century America, and the attention to detail here was quite good.  It was interesting to see how ill-concieved prohibition was and what a mess it made.  I also appreciated the depictions of real historical characters, since I've had an interest in mafia history since I was young.

However, for me, the negatives of this series are substantial.  After the first season, the characters and plot too often became implausible, and once the spell is broken in that way, you're no longer hooked, no longer immersed in another reality.  It's as though the creators of the series had only planned for one season, then started winging it after that.  I also found the graphic violence to be too much at times, in a sensationalistic way.  I think it may have contributed to giving me bad dreams, which I could have done without.  Last but definitely not least, the series ends with sadness which borders on depressing.  The general theme of the whole series seems to be that bad people can ruin other people's lives in a way which perpetuates misery across generations.  Perhaps that's true, but it seems like a narrow yield of insight from five seasons of episodes.

Overall, this series just isn't on the same level as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc., and for me I'm not sure it was worth the time I spent watching it.  Five stars for Season 1, but three stars for the overall series.",1475107200,2,1513,4.7034220532319395
