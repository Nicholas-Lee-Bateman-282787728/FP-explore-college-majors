8444841,2,B004WBIUI2,"I bought this series, and while the series is great (I watched part of it online already) The subtitles are extremely poor. If you didn't already know the gist of what was going on you wouldn't know what the heck was happening. The subtitles are so bad that they inverse word order from what it should be in English so that the sentences don't even make sentences. And then they translate everybody's name, meaning they put the meaning of the person's name where the actual name should be, this took me a while to figure out, like why they kept call Wanko one-child or son. It was very wierd. And I also know a little Japanese and I what I do know I realize that how they translate some stuff, like even just basic phrases, is not correct.

So basically, great series, but bad subs!",1305676800,3,782,4.393103448275862
