1359603,5,B00004W190,"Something Weird Video does it again with this fantastic double feature of two of Doris Wishman's greatest ""roughies"".
BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL is an interesting little curio starring Gigi Darlene as a young wife who is attacked by her dentally-challenged janitor and accidentally kills him.  Fearing the worst the girl flees to New York but ends up living with weirdo after weirdo, including Darlene Bennett who plays a shapely lesbian who does nothing but swan around in body-stockings!
ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER MAN stars Barbie Kemp as a beehived newlywed whose husband suddenly takes ill and has to stay in bed for about half a year (as you do), and has no option but to follow her friend (Darlene Bennett) and become a sex worker.  Interestingly, Kemp wears the same black-lace bodysuit worn by Bennett in the earlier film!
Of course, the big advantage is the ""Let's Go To The Drive-In"" feature which couples the two films together along with various concession stand ads and intermission shorts.  There are also some great trailers for other Wishman films in addition to the films presented here.
Be sure to check out the other Something Weird Video double-features which include GIRL GANG/THE VIOLENT YEARS and THE NOTORIOUS DAUGHTER OF FANNY HILL/THE HEAD MISTRESS.",1013644800,8,1263,5.004761904761905
1359604,4,B00004W190,"Where in the heck is Joe Bob Briggs? He was the mainstay of cult TV first on Fridays and then late night Saturdays. He brought us the best of the worst of the B flicks and a running trailer park commentary that would rival anything the original SNL writers threw at us. I miss him. Joe Bob hosted a series of these sixties cheapies which were a genre unto their own. Wild women in fishnet body suits being chased by brutes in polka-dot boxer shorts were the basic plots. In this gem, we follow the misadventures of a penniless and brainless chick lost in the Big Apple. Directed by Doris Wishman who brought Chesty Morgan to the screen (check out the kid in his bedroom in ""Serial Mom"") and used many aliases in her work. Rated 336 of ""The Sleaziest Movies In The History Of The World."" If you are a fan of this genre, you will howl with delight. If your fave film is ""The English Patient"", you may now move freely about the cabin.",998006400,3,931,4.295454545454546
1359605,1,B00004W190,"I paid $25.00 plus shipping for this DVD based upon the great reviews and general internet buzz and I have to say it is one of only two out of approximately 85 DVDs that I own that I sincerely wish that I could get my money back.  I was very disappointed!  I didn't find these two features, Bad Girls and Another Day, entertaining at all.  They played like a couple of features from somebody's film class with minimal plot, minimal acting, minimal nudity, minimal atmosphere, well, you get the idea.  I don't get the hype at all.  I expected a kinky movie from the sixties.  This is not like that at all and I personally found it to be BORING!  Thank you very much.",987552000,7,665,4.314516129032258

7924546,5,B00004W190,"Came quickly and well packaged. The movies (Bad Girls Go To Hell and Another Day Another Man) are just as absurd as you'd expect so I'm very pleased. Doris Wishman is a fabulous director, a true auteur. Will definitely buy more.",1446681600,2,228,4.585365853658536
7924547,5,B00004W190,Bad Girls Go to Hell is the best sleaze film I own.  This is the first sleaze film I ever saw and it started me on my collection spree.  Gigi Darlene makes this film and Doris Wiseman had to have a crazy since of humor.,1362268800,,219,3.8444444444444446

7924549,2,B00004W190,"I will keep this short and sweet; something the movie was not.
It states on the Amazon film page that this movie has a release date of 2010.
That may be; however, it was produced and filmed in 1965 and has all the earmarks of a film of that time.  Was it horrible?  Back then, probably not. It might have even been a bit groundbreaking in a few of the parts.  The lesbian fling was different for back then.  But, all in all, for today, the movie was not worth my time to watch it.  If you are a huge fan of back then movies, enjoy; otherwise, save your money.",1350777600,2,559,4.045454545454546

7924551,1,B00004W190,"A sexploitation flick that's risen to cult status based on its lurid title alone, Bad Girls Go To Hell is a time-capsule of sixties' sleaze. Don't expect Doris Wishman to inject any feminist subtext into this misogynist genre. This was Wishman's first roughie, a subgenre focusing on titillating the audience with male violence perpetrated against women. Sadly, this trend of equating sex with violence continues to be prevalent in pornography today.
Wishman, like fellow exploitation director Russ Meyer, shows considerable skill as an editor. However, Bad Girls Go To Hell is a technical mess. The threadbare plot focuses on a housewife who flees the police after murdering her rapist. Why she doesn't claim self-defense for the quite justified killing is never explained.
The housewife, played by Gigi Darlene, is quite a beautiful woman. She carries herself with grace and poise, seemingly unaffected by Wishman's leering camera. There are numerous salacious shots focusing on Darlene's buxom form, but most of the nudity appears in the first ten minutes. After that, the film relies more on her meager acting talents.
The movie ends with an ""it was all just a dream"" coda, explaining away some of the more bizarre and unrealistic moments. The strongest moments of this film, a lesbian subplot, appears to have been cut to ribbons by outraged sensors.",1303344000,,1355,5.191780821917808
7924552,5,B00004W190,"Doris Wishman (1912-2002) stands out in the history of sexploitation films because she had the distinction of being a successful woman director in a genre dominated by men.  Wishman started making films set at nudist camps and probably enjoyed her most success making ""nudie cuties"" such as ""Nudes on the Moon.""  But the two Wishman films on this Something Weird Video double-feature represent prime examples of the ""Roughies"" that defined the middle of her film career before she moved on to the ""Ghoulies"" (e.g., ""A Night to Dismember"") and soft core (e.g., ""Double Agent 73"").  This is a SWV ""Special Edition"" DVD, which means that in terms of the extras you are talking wall-to-wall Doris Wishman.  Plus, if you just hit play when you get to the main menu you are treated to a complete Drive-In Theater experience.

""Bad Girls Go To Hell"" (1965) is the story of Meg Kelton (Gigi Darlene), whose husband Ted (Alan Yorke) goes off to work one day.  Meg is then sexually assaulted by the owner of the building, who warns her not to let her husband know what has happened.  When Ted goes off to work again, the sleaze ball leaves Meg a message to come visit him or else her husband will find out what has happened (I guess Meg believes Ted will think it was her fault she was raped).  Meg tries to buy off the guy, but when he attacks her again she kills him.  Fleeing Boston for New York City, Meg now says she is Ellen Green from Chicago.  What happens next is that she ends up in a series of encounters with people who are apparently trying to help her, but who get her into just more sleazy encounters.  Then we get something of a ""Twilight Zone"" twist at the end.

""Another Day, Another Man"" (1966) starts with Ann (Barbi Kemp) getting married and moving out of the apartment she shares with Tess (Mary O'Hara), who happens to be a prostitute.  Ann is happy for a while, but then hubby falls sick and since she cannot go back to her old job (her boss does not want married women in the office) she turns to hooking instead for Tess's pimp, Bert (Sam Stewart), who provides a film noir voice over when he explains how he put together his stable of prostitutes (including twins).  Her husband does not really understand why she has to go out to work for a few hours at night in different places each night but he eventually sees the light and that is not a good thing.

Wishman certainly has a distinctive visual style and since she does all of her sound back in the studio there is sense of dislocation because characters have conversations without their lips moving.  However, what makes these two films stand out from most of Wishman's other work is that there is relatively little nudity, consisting mostly of bare backsides.  Otherwise you are talking about women who buy bras a couple of sizes too small and men who would rather slap a woman while taking what they want rather than providing even a pretense of affection.  Wishman's camera never fully shows what is going on, not just because that would bring on ratings concerns, but also because showing everything would be tantamount to endorsing it, and that is not her goal.  If there is a common moral to the two films, which were made consecutively, it would be that once a woman falls, she falls hard and she falls often.  Even when Meg/Ellen finds someone to be safe with, it turns out to be another woman, and it is the story as much as any idea of character motivation that leads her to leave and move on to the next act of degradation.  The question then becomes what Meg and Ann could have done to avoid their fates, or are they simply doomed because they are women a.k.a. the weaker sex?

Can we put these films in some larger sociological context, specifically the argument that the Roughies are a reaction to the sexual politics of the 1960s the way the nudist camp films were a response to the relative complacency of the Eisenhower years?  Sure.  But then the undercurrent of violence towards women goes back cinematically to the entire film noir genre where a tough guy is as likely to shoot a dame or at least belt her around as kiss her.  For most people these are not erotic films, but depressing tales of a sexual dynamic that belongs back in the Stone Age and not in the great metropolitan area of New York City when the Sexual Revolution was in full swing.

One of the strengths of the Something Weird Video series is that when they focus on an auteur, they go the whole way.  All of the trailers are for Doris Wishman films: ""Bad Girls Go to Hell,"" ""Indecent Desires,"" ""A Taste of Flesh,"" ""Another Day, Another Man"" (which is where we get the theme music for Something Weird Video), ""My Brothers Wife,"" ""Too Much, Too Often,"" and ""The Amazing Transplant.""  There is also a Book Pitch for ""Man and Male"" and ""Woman and Female,"" a set of books you can get by turning on the parking lights of your car.  Besides the Book Pitch and the trio of Intermission Countdowns, there is a Doris Wishman Gallery of Exploitation Art,which covers all phases of her career.  You even get some exit bits to complete your drive-in experience (""Please Replace Speaker When You Leave...If Torn From the Stand, Please Leave in Box at Exit"").",1122940800,6,5204,4.53475935828877
7924553,3,B00004W190,"Amazon's description, and the accompanying customer reviews, pretty much hit the mark: Both ""Bad Girls Go To Hell"" and ""Another Day, Another Man"" sport amateurish production values, frequent lapses in visual and thematic coherence, and a strange fascination with inanimate objects such as potted plants and third-rate framed artwork.  Yet, as most of the comments here also point out, there is also an undeniable power and attraction at work here, a kind of compelling, dreamlike quality that keeps one's attention. Of course, the numerous women lounging around in lingerie and body stockings in both films might have something to do with the movies' hold over viewers. Both movies feature surprisingly clean, sharp prints, and like most other Something Weird releases, this DVD also has numerous bonus features including trailers, short subjects, and promotional artwork.",1121299200,11,872,5.507462686567164
7924554,2,B00004W190,"Hi everybody!  I really trashed this movie when I first viewed and reviewed it.  After leaving it on the shelf for over a year I decided to try again and I admit that I may have been a little too harsh in my criticism the first time.  I'm still disappointed that it failed to live up to the hype but this movie DVD does have some redeeming qualities, especially if you start it at the beginning and watch it all the way through as if you were at a drive in theater.  I didn't do that the first time, I just watched the two featured movies and skipped the ""extras"".  The trailers from other Doris Wishman movies were very good and I plan to buy some of them when they finally come out on DVD.  Now that I've seen Gigi Darlene and Darlene Bennett in the ""Olga"" movies and other movies I can better appreciate them in these movies.  I decided to write a second review rather than ""edit"" my previous one so that you can still use it.  Good luck and thanks!",1018137600,6,952,4.163934426229508
