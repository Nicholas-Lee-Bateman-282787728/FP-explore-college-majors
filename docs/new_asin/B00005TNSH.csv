7953746,5,B00005TNSH,"Like in one of those old Dracula movies when they removed the wooden stake from the heart of the Dracula skeleton and it comes back to life...........just watching the incredible energy that these blue eyed soul music makers exude took me back in time 20 years and to the energy that I used to experience when I would see this band live and in person.  I had completely forgotten what an incredible energy high they used to create in the clubs that they played in throughout SoCal in the 80's and this VHS recaptures it all.

Voted the Best Party Band of the 80's in SoCal, I used to watch these guys play endlessly at the famed Palomino Club in North Hollywood, and this VHS performance captures all of the energy, fun, craziness and good times of the famed band.  I had forgotten what that kind of energy flowing through my veins felt like, as I have not seen them play for over 20 years now, and I believe that the band is mostly have broken up now and they don't play anymore.

Their song selection includes all of their club favorites, and this is the original band which features Max Carl Gronenthal singing (now with Grand Funk Railroad), from their first album..........the Cardiac Party.

From the opening introductory sounds that mimic the famous opening from James Brown and the Fabulous Flames, Lee Thornburg starts the incredible energy flowing on this VHS by introducing the worlds #1 Soul-Shaking, Memory-Stirring, High-Energy- Creating Band in the world.  Just the intro alone will get you standing up in your living room wanting to hear the rest of the tape.  Dead people have been known to walk when they hear the intro.

After that, just fasten your seat belts and relive the fabulous energy and memories of this great band, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack.

This is their only known live performance captured for History's sake on VHS.  The video quality is at times a bit iffy, but that matters little, as one simply has to turn up the sound, and get ready to party.

If you like the Blues Brothers kind of thing, then this is a must.  These guys were an original bunch of fabulous studio musicians who got together on the weekend to just have fun, and fun they did create.

If you watch this and you are not at least tapping your feet, then you have a huge problem, as the only reason you wouldn't be tapping your feet is that you are a corpse and dead as a doornail.",1121731200,,2388,4.512761020881671
