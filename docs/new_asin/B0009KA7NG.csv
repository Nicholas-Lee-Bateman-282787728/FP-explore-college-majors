8323989,5,B0009KA7NG,"This is a great DVD for highlights.  This was an exciting tournament, considering Woods is unbeatable when leading after three rounds in a major. On the final day, Chris DiMarco almost pulled off the upset, after Woods bogeyed 17 and 18, and DiMarco nearly chipped in his third shot at 18.

My favorite part of the DVD is the coverage of ""The Shot"", the once-in-a-lifetime chip shot Woods knocked down at 16. The DVD starts out with a great angle of this.  The camera used for this video clip was stationed almost at ground level directly across the green from where Tiger hits the shot, so your view of the action is like you are standing on the other side of the green looking in. There's no voice-over or commentating. It's pure video and audio, so you just see Tiger hitting the shot up onto the hillside of the green, and you hear the crowd's roar grow louder and louder as the ball crawls toward the hole until the ball sits at the edge of the cup, then the groan of the crowd as Tiger hunches down pleading for the ball to drop, then finally the ball dropping as the crowd goes crazy and Tiger pumps his fist. I don't know how many times I've rewound this. It's goose-bump material.

There's also a special chapter dedicated to this shot, with comments by Tiger.  This DVD is worth the price just for this coverage.",1184025600,4,1322,4.423868312757202
8323990,5,B0009KA7NG,"This DVD is a great recap of the tournament and especially the final day, when Woods and DiMarco battled it out on Augusta National.",1183852800,,132,4.541666666666667
8323991,5,B0009KA7NG,"I loved this disc. The quality of the video is amazing on disc...much better than what you get to see on television. I liked the coverage of the tournament from all the different angles, e.g. seeing the crowd react to big moments from the players. I really can see what it would be like being there...the disc really immerses you in augusta and the tournament atmosphere. You follow the players from preweek events, to the practice tee,  and follow the leaders through the tourney. Nothing beats a tiger vs. dimarco show down either. Seeing Dimarco watch tiger blaze through the third round ahead of him and pass him on the leader board. Pretty cool. Watching tiger take control of the playoff hole, seeing jack nicklaus say good bye to one of his favorite venues, and seeing all the great shots of the masters...you can't beat this.

The only thing I wish it had was a flyover of all the holes. I really would like to see that on dvd.",1163462400,2,935,4.5266272189349115
8323992,3,B0009KA7NG,"For those of you out there that maybe are looking something like I did, that is, a video that compacted the action of the world's best golfers, this is not it, ok. I was expecting the highlights of all the major stars in golf to review their swing styles, but this is not the DVD intended for that. It is more concentrated in the tournament, Tiger Woods (of course!) and Chris Dimarco, not even all of the other top shots like Vijay, Michelson, Els, Goosen, Love, etc. have their own spot, instead just a slight flash of how they lost their opportunity.

But if you're looking for ""Just the Highlights of the Masters"" this is a good DVD. And don't expect a very elegant film production with great narration like those NFL films either.",1141689600,,735,4.485074626865671
8323993,4,B0009KA7NG,"only negative point... it could always show more shots and more players, but the dvd delivers an excellent summary of the tournament, shows a lot of great golf shots and emotions.",1120694400,3,179,4.806451612903226
