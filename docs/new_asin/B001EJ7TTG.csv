8298355,5,B001EJ7TTG,"This is an awesome glimpse into the glory days of motorsport. This dvd has lots of archival footage as well as modern ""historic"" racing action.  This dvd has a lot of facinating interviews/panel discussions by the men who where there. THis disc is a must for Can Am/serious motorsport fans.",1297036800,,290,4.8
