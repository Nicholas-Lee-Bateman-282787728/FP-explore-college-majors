8594460,5,B00DMD7YII,"First things first, this is a PAL format disc. Your DVD player must support PAL (the US standard is NTSC). It is also labelled Region 2, but my player says it is region-free.

Second, the complete list of six cars featured is as follows:
- Mercedes-Benz R107 280SL
- Lotus Espirit S3
- Fiat 500
- Land Rover Series III Stage One V8
- Citroen DS
- Bentley Mulsanne Turbo

Lastly, if you have not seen ""Wheeler Dealers"" before you are in for a treat. This show is just superb. You get some history on the car, you follow Mike as he buys a used one, then Ed shows you the step-by-step of fixing it up. And unlike most shows, Ed REALLY DOES show you how to do it. Every greasy bolt and leaking gasket is dealt with in turn. What's best is that it's clear both Mike and Ed are in love with cars in general, and these particular cars especially. It's really a charming show.",1430697600,,868,4.191616766467066
