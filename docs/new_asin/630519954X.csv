989386,4,630519954X,"I like the music and the video.  It seems a little bit dated, but I still really like it.

It is exactly what I had hoped for.

It doesn't have any dialogue or story, so if you are looking for some sort of story, better not get this one.

This dvd is just video shots of places, Christmas type scenes, trees, ect...  It is great to have on when you want some ambiance, but are not watching the television.

I was originally looking for something from Manheim Steamroller.  I heard they have video of sleigh rides and other Christmas scenes playing on the big screens at their concerts and I thought that sounded great.

This isn't Manheim Steamroller, but it is the closest thing that I could find to what I had in mind.",1229299200,,720,4.32089552238806
989387,5,630519954X,"I remember watching ""The Spirit of Christmas"" around Christmas time in the 1960's while growing up in Philadelphia.  We looked forward to watching it each year.  When this special was shown, I loved watching the Norelco Electric Razor commercial* of Santa sliding up and down snow covered hills. Especially when we had tons of our own snow right outside of our windows for us to play in the next day.

I've been living on the West coast since 1969 and caught the tail end of this classic in 1995.  I saw it was sponsored by The Bell System company and contacted them.  They graciously sent me a free copy on VHS that also includes The Nativity story. I received it the day before Thanksgiving. It was a shear joy to see it again after so many years.

I thought it was only shown on the East coast, but a friend said that he remembers seeing it while growing up in California during the 1980s. (?)The VHS tape I have also has an intro from a blind institute showing volunteers making Braille Christmas books with stuffed Santas and reindeers on the pages for blind children.

I would say, buy it for your kids that are younger than six and only show them the classic once a year during Christmas.  That way they will anticipate seeing it and will have fond memories of this great and wonderfully simple telling of the story, ""The Night Before Christmas."" Especially compared to what is available now.

I'm looking forward to receiving this version on DVD.  It is mentioned that it was taken from Mabel Beaton's original print.

As another treat, add the DVD Humperdinck's ""Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy"" (1954). It's available on Amazon. It's done with stop action puppetry. It's a great intro to Opera for children and fun to watch around Halloween and even Christmas.

989388,4,630519954X,"This might be a bit slow for modern audiences, but for those old enough to remember this kind of show, it has a charm that today's digital animation could never duplicate. It's the kind of thing you should only watch on Christmas Eve, or maybe the night before, because it reminds me a lot of the programs they used to show on pre-cable TV the day or two right before Christmas, after a lot of the other stuff had already been aired in previous weeks. My main complaint about the presentation is that they took out the original Bell commercials, which is a shame because the introductions tease you about them and then don't deliver. However, it's fun to see the old Bell logo in the opening credits. (Bell sounds a lot more friendly than today's successors, by the way.) The Mabel Beaton interview is extremely slow -- grainy, with one camera, and she's up in years by the time it was done. But it does give you some insight into the whole puppeting process. I'd watch that once and stick to the Christmas specials yearly after that.",1164499200,21,1034,4.50531914893617

In half an hour we young viewers anticipated the joys of a visit from Santa Claus, followed by a reverent telling of the birth of Jesus.  In the intervening years since this program used to air, many more sophisticated Christmas shows came along to become our favorites.  I was very happy, though, to be reunited with this reminder of simpler, happy times when my brother gave me a VHS copy recorded from his local PBS station some years ago.

Usually the reel version was shown before we left school for Christmas break. I learned to recite the ""Night Before Christmas"" because of this video. I can remember seeing the scenes in my head as I said the poem. The marionettes fascinated me then, and still do today. My grandchildren love this video. Each segment, the Nativity and Night Before Christmas, are just the right length for 3-8 year-olds probably about 10 minutes. It's not glitzy like so much of what is aired today, but that doesn't mean the production is poorly done in any way. It's just different. Like others, I was under the impression that only east coast people saw it back in the late 50s and 60s, but apparently that isn't true.

I agree with another review which lamented the cuts, removing the commercials for the telephone company. I seem to remember it ending with a telephone operator (w/ a vintage headset) encircled by a big Christmas wreath, wishing us all a Merry Christmas. The transfer doesn't seem quite as sharp and vivid as it did in that creaky old auditorium fifty years ago, but this was quite a find nevertheless.

I had long since lost track of the show,but I always wanted to see it again. I searched like crazy to find it and was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon in DVD.

Every December, as Christmas approached, a local Pittsburgh station would air this puppet show, brought to you by ""The Telephone Company"" (yes, there was only ONE!) I always thought it was very well done, with puppet faces that seemed to display true emotion. Little matter that you could actually see the strings or sticks, holding the creations upright. Alexander Sourby's superb narration of both ""'Twas The Night Before Christmas"" and ""The Nativity"" short stories is a major ""plus"" here. Even though the half hour program was filmed for television in 1952, the producers had the foresight to film the show in color. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, the original ""Ma Bell"" commercials, integral to the flow of the show, have been edited out for this DVD release. This lends itself to some ""choppiness"" in editing, especially in the scenes with ""our host"" and the female telephone operator, who seems to appear out of nowhere at the end of the program! Aside from that, it is nice to view this classic, once again. An added bonus is another holiday related short subject with Santa driving a rocket ship, instead of his reindeer! Dated, but the kids may still show an interest in it. This DVD is perhaps more for the adults of the 'Boomer"" generation, than for today's youngsters, who might find it entertaining, but slow paced. An extensive one hour interview (from 1984) with the puppet's female creator, gives some background and insight into the production techniques of the 1950's. ""The Mayflower Mouse"" was a similar production, and some short scenes are shown from that ""Scholastic Magazine"" award-winning film, during the interview.",1292630400,16,1777,5.089041095890411

I discovered the movie on a site called TV Party and after reading the short blurb on the site and viewing the screen cap that was included, my curiosity was piqued. So I went over to youtube to sample it, as I do with most films before buying them, and I instantly fell in love with its simplistic charm. The puppetry is primitive in a sense and yet brilliant for the time this was produced. Its very nostalgic, before the age of cgi and all those distracting special effects. From a gentler, simpler time.

I especially enjoyed the nativity segment and bought it just for that. Though there have been hundreds maybe even thousands of yuletide movies made since the dawn of cinema, there are few that touch on the nativity story. Even though the nativity segment is a mere 15 minutes, its the best interpretation I've ever seen.",1265068800,5,1068,4.557291666666667

There are two marionette shows:  one, The Night Before Christmas and two, The Nativity.  The Night Before Christmas is funny as this was produced at a time when marionettes still possessed a jerky type of movement; yet, no one can be blaise about the skill it took to produce a quality film.  Surely the producer and the puppeteers were masters of their craft at the time.  The Nativity is a sweet film that would be especially good for very young children.  I still watch this film with the same intensity that I felt when I was watching it in our school auditorium.  This is a cinematic jewel and only a Scrooge would discount the films value in terms of creative and clean entertainment.

7885252,5,630519954X,"I have been looking for this item for years.  I remember it since I was a child.  The first time I saw it was in the 50s on a cold Christmas morning. My family had gone to Midnight Mass.  When we left the church there was ice falling.  We got home and opened our gifts and someone turne the TV on. Lo and behold, it was ""The Spirit of Christmas.""  It was telecast every Christmas back then and for many years.  It was in black and white, since color TV was available back then, but it was originally filmed in color and this is what is offered here in this DVD.  It is a joy to see in color.  They are puppets. If you look closely, you'll see the strings.  Though they are marionettes, they do not lack in emotion. The first segment tells the story of ""The Night Before Christmas"" (A Visit from St. Nicholas) by Clement Moore.  It is MARVELLOUS.  The figures seem almost life-like.  This was before computer CGI.  There is almost nostalgic quality to the characters and sets.  Everything is perfect to the last detail.  The second segment is ""The Birth of Christ"" beautifully narrated and very accurate in its depiction.  Some will complain at the Wise Men showing up.  It is believed that the shepherds did not arrive on the same night of Christ's birth.  This may be true, but what would the Christmas story be without the Magi.  It is a classic.  I was surprised (it was filmed in 1950, and first telecast in 1953) that it was so well preserved.  The only annoying thing is the commercials and introduction. Bell Telephone was responsible for bringing it on the air.  To many this (the introduction and ads) will transport them to a now gone time and age. ""The Philadelphia Holiday Clasic"" is one the cover calls it. It aired originally in the Philadelphia area.  Mabel Beaton and her husband Les were the creators of films, commercials and television productions using marionettes and very effectively.  It was a Christmas gift to me and as soon as I got it, I put it on.  On my 4K TV, the characters almost seemed to jump right out of the set.  In fact, it looked a hundred times better than on those old early American TV sets of old.  Please buy, you will not regret it.  The saddest part is that it goes by so quickly.
