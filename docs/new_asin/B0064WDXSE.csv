8492985,3,B0064WDXSE,"She talks too much. It's fine the first time I viewed it but now I have to fast forward past all the introductions and bs to finally get to the beginning. Then there are still a couple of spots she runs off at the mouth and it's distracting and messes up the flow. All in all, it's just ok.",1495929600,,290,3.9322033898305087
8492986,3,B0064WDXSE,"I found the routine worthy enough. I think it soots both beginners and intermediates. The negative was the way the instructor speaks. She talks too fast and says way too much. I get annoyed while doing the routine because I can't always get into that relaxing yoga zone from listening to her constant talking, she doesn't pause enough.",1396137600,2,335,4.793103448275862
8492987,5,B0064WDXSE,"I first came across this DVD at the local library and decided to check it out. Of all the fitness DVDs I've tried, this is my favorite. It was especially helpful for trying yoga for the first time because Jackie confidently walks you through each position, while showing variations for beginners and experienced yogis. Arguably one of the best aspects of the DVD is how personalized it feels. I felt that I was genuinely being guided through the positions one-on-one, which is difficult to accomplish outside of a class. It also helps that Jackie recognizes that not everyone who practices yoga is lean, young, or in great shape.",1385510400,2,629,4.833333333333333
8492988,5,B0064WDXSE,"I have been practicing yoga regularly for about three years, and found this DVD to be a wonderful addition to my practice. Most of the poses are simple enough so that they can be attained by beginners. This DVD is a perfect choice for anyone just starting yoga or someone who just wants to go back to basics... Everyone should get this yoga DVD!!",1334016000,3,346,4.421875
8492989,5,B0064WDXSE,Took a chance on this one and glad I did.  I can actually do the routines and they are explained extremely well.  I can not bend into a pretzel and they know it!  How did they know!~  Anyway it is very good and I feel like I am better at it already.,1326931200,3,249,3.730769230769231
