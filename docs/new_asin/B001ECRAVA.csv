8297732,5,B001ECRAVA,I was delighted to see that you really can just do one 10 minute segment of these workouts if that is all you have time for.  It is really a pretty good workout especially if you want to keep low impact and have little time to do a comprehensive workout.  It is also great for just stretching.  This is pretty important if you are in your 50's  or 60's as I am.,1265587200,,361,3.9722222222222223
8297733,4,B001ECRAVA,"3 DVD's for a low price was great.  I really like the 10 Minute Solution Series, and the Fat to Firm is good for begginers, though not as intense as I had hoped.",1264982400,,161,3.878787878787879
8297734,5,B001ECRAVA,These are a great value.  I especially love the 10 minute solution DVDs because they are easy to customize and have a decent workout.,1238889600,8,133,4.541666666666667
