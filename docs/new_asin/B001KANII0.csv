8314542,5,B001KANII0,"This movie is very extreme! Im still shocked with what I saw... I can't watch it anymore. I've become traumatized by the opening death scene. This is just too much for me, but hey, I thought I could handle it. Guess not. This is good for all those hardcore people who can handle REAL death scenes.",1318032000,8,297,4.321428571428571
8314543,4,B001KANII0,"I'm one of those demented, sick individuals that find this kind of stuff fascinating, so in that respect, this is the series of DVD's for you if you're a fellow freak. I know a lot of people are protesting the content...that's ridiculous! It's called ""Banned In America"" for a reason. Duh.",1292889600,7,289,4.686274509803922
8314544,4,B001KANII0,"After viewing the infamous ""Faces Of Death"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Original-Faces-of-Death-30th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001BBAVPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Original Faces of Death: 30th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray</a>]) series, i was looking for the next step in this genre of movies and i decided to go with this.  Featuring live suicides, executions and people just being stupid, this dvd is definitely disturbing to say the least even for someone who thinks they've seen it all.  I would definitely not recommend this video to anyone below the age of 17 and if you are planing on purchasing this dvd i do recommend first buying the Faces Of Death just to prepare yourself.  And although it may sound bad, this is very addicting to watch.  Every fiber of your being will want to turn away but its very hard to resist watching which is where it gets its ""entertainment"" value.",1273968000,7,943,5.762589928057554
