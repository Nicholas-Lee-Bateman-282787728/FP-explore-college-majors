7270377,5,B00Z27MB0I,I have several of Jillian Michaels workout DVDs this one is my favorite because its low impact starting out and easy to follow. It had me sweating in a good way and I loved it.. Will surely continue this DVD for a month to lose major LBs.,1449446400,,238,4.085106382978723
7270378,5,B00Z27MB0I,love it good workout,1448236800,,20,4.25
7270379,5,B00Z27MB0I,"I don't own the Body Revolution series, so I was happy to be able to purchase the cardio workouts separately.  Jillian doesn't have many pure cardio workout DVDs, so this is is perfect. The workouts are great.",1445904000,4,209,4.648648648648648
7270380,5,B00Z27MB0I,Great Workout!,1445817600,,14,6.5
7270381,5,B00Z27MB0I,I love this Julian Michaels workout it is exciting and you do not get bored. I will buy the other Jillian Michaels workout videos also.,1445299200,,135,4.44
7270382,4,B00Z27MB0I,"Good, classic Jillian, though not as challenging as some, probably because it's all pretty straightforward cardio. I like her DVDs that incorporate strength training as well, which can also be utilized as cardio. But then again, of course, cardio is the billing on this one.",1443139200,3,274,5.111111111111111
7270383,5,B00Z27MB0I,"Definitely a plus to add to your workout routine. I'll break it down for you: first two cardio workouts each exercise is a minute long. Cardio 3 they are shorter in duration but there are more of them.
Cardio 1
March in place, fast feet (called hot feet in this one), squat punch,
jog in place, running man, speed bad, arm circles w/ kickouts, suicides repeat 2 more times
Cardio 2 Jump rope, butt kicks, high knees, alternating knee thrusts, jumping jacks, fast feet, skaters, skiers, plie hop,, cross jacks, upper cuts, towel run (like a towel is on the ground and you run around it first one way then the other), right hook, left hook, burpee's repeat 2 more times
Cardio 3
windmills, jumping front kicks, fast feet, knee thrusts right then left, double unders, plank mogels,rocks star jumps, squat jumps, jumping lunges, squat jacks, high knees drop into plank and up, long jump back two, stanking mountain climber, high knees w/ rotation, canon ball (jump and grab your knees), plank bring foot up between knees then bring other foot in and out switch legs and repeat, crab kicks, jump in and out of plank, down dog thrusters, zig zag jumps up 4 back 4, side plank burpees, single leg cross hops, plank punches then repeat 2 more times.

Anyone who does Jillian's workout's will recognise some familiar faces which is always nice. I haven't done all the levels yet I just got it, but I have a bunch of the other dvd's that jillian has out and I've been doing her workouts for over 3 years now. Needed to lose a few pounds and more importantly get my pressure under control. I have done cardio 1 and I like it. I did check and seems this was part of her body revolution set, not sure why we can get it separately but I'm glad.",1440028800,21,1730,4.474683544303797
7270384,4,B00Z27MB0I,"I was surprised to see this DVD come out when it did.  It is the three cardio workouts from Body Revolution.  As Jillian Michaels is currently marketing her newer version ""Bodyshred"", I didn't expect a release like this.  I haven't heard her promote it anywhere, nor is it for sale on her website.  (I also thought it was weird because I think it is the same picture as is on Hard Body).  I don't have Body Revolution, so I haven't been exposed to these workouts before.  I like the DVD for being a 30 minute cardio day workout - the workouts are fun.  Sometimes going for a run seems redundant, so I like to have a way to mix it up.  The moves are pretty straight forward and there are three levels that increase in difficulty.  I don't feel like there are any really crazy moves in this one.",1436054400,26,793,4.268456375838926
7270385,4,B00Z27MB0I,"As I understand, the three cardio workouts on this DVD are from the Jillian Michaels Body Revolution workout. Nevertheless, if you want a good 30 min cardio session without the other components of the Body Revolution workout, this DVD is a good investment. I have nothing but raves for the cast in this workout. Many are familiar faces from Jillian's other workouts, & they make each session engaging & entertaining. The individual exercises in each workout increase in intensity from the 1st to the 3rd. However, I actually found the 1st workout to be the most challenging since it has the least number of exercises (8 in total), so you are spending a while on each move. The 2nd workout has 15 exercises, & the 3rd workout has 25 exercises. The more exercises per workout, the shorter the amount of time spent on each exercise. The only difficult thing about having so many exercises by the 3rd workout is the feeling that the workout seems a lot longer. But again, the cast is motivating & distracts you from this thinking most of the time.",1481932800,,1043,4.673913043478261
7270386,5,B00Z27MB0I,Very good DVD.  Three amazing workouts at very high intensity and definitly work up a major sweat!!  Would recommend this DVD for anyone look to lose weight and/or get extremely fit with cardio.,1481328000,,194,4.848484848484849
7270387,3,B00Z27MB0I,"The workouts are good, but I was angry & disappointed to discover that these are the exact 3 cardio workouts that are part of Jillian Michaels Body Revolution, which I already own.",1471564800,19,180,4.65625
7270388,5,B00Z27MB0I,I love all of Jillian's workouts.  This one is especially good consisting of one minute cardio intervals in which you repeat the same long circuit twice.  Really good cardio workout!,1464912000,3,182,5.033333333333333
7270389,4,B00Z27MB0I,"I love Jillian, and this workout does not disappoint.  Cardio that is just the right amount of difficult and will leave you sweating.",1462406400,,133,4.782608695652174
7270390,5,B00Z27MB0I,"I really like this DVD. I love to be able to choose, at times, to do a strictly cardio workout. There are three workouts on this, all cardio. This is a great workout!",1459382400,,166,4.0606060606060606
7270391,5,B00Z27MB0I,Great price and arrived in timely manner!,1457654400,2,41,5.0
7270392,2,B00Z27MB0I,"This is not one of Jillian's best. Each workout has a long circuit that you repeat 3 times. There is no break from the cardio (for strength or abs) and each segment is a long and repetitive movement (like most of her workouts) that you do for a minute or so. The whole workout is super repetitive and, for me, has a dread factor. I prefer her ""Boost Metabolism"" for a cardio workout.",1455062400,4,383,4.260273972602739
7270393,5,B00Z27MB0I,Another great DVD from Jillian! Cardio is not my favorite but as always she pushes you through it. Thanks Jillian!,1453939200,,114,4.75
7270394,5,B00Z27MB0I,"PERFECT! I have a lot of Jillian's videos and wanted to mix it up a bit and get more cardio in my routines, level 1 is pretty easy so I only did that level once. Level two started to test my endurance with all of Jillian's signature moves. I just started doing level 3 last week and it is amazing. Would expect nothing less from America's best trainer! Get it and get moving!",1452384000,4,375,4.1506849315068495
8719477,5,B00Z27MB0I,Love love love this workout! It really kicks your butt and gets you into shape. I highly recommend. I like to to use this video and her lift and shred.,1534377600,,151,4.066666666666666
8719478,1,B00Z27MB0I,It was broken and actually split in half when I opened the package. Totally useless!,1532995200,,84,4.666666666666667
8719479,4,B00Z27MB0I,Like but it is hard.,1531094400,,20,3.2

8719482,5,B00Z27MB0I,"Love this DVD so much, I Love Jillian Michaels, She has transformed my body into an amazing shape! I have never felt better in my Life, she's not only my fitness coach.., she's my life coach! Strongly recommend!!!",1517529600,,213,4.631578947368421
8719483,5,B00Z27MB0I,"Such a fun cardio workout!  I enjoyed the banter between Jillian and her workout cohorts.  Some you will recognize if you have been using Jillian's workout videos for years like myself.
I would say if you're in pretty good shape you can skip level 1 and use level 2 & 3.  Those are fun, challenging but not hard to follow, and you'll get a great workout!",1516752000,,354,4.333333333333333
8719484,5,B00Z27MB0I,Great workout as expected from Jillian,1513555200,,38,5.5
8719485,5,B00Z27MB0I,"Great cardio workouts!  These are the 3 cardio workouts from her Body Revolution series, but on one DVD.  If you're wanting to build up, I'd recommend pairing this with Beginner Shred and transitioning through those workouts into Ripped in 30.  The Body Revolution strength workouts aren't as effective as Beginner Shred.  In Body Revolution, she already has you doing jumping planks in Workout 3.  Dangerous for weak shoulders.  No insanity in Beginner Shred, just efficient, effective workouts.

Important Note: Cardio 1 on this DVD uses 1-minute intervals to help you build up your basic stamina.  This makes Cardio 1 much more tedious, but also a great place to start.  Don't be discouraged by its repetitiveness, though.  2 and 3 on this DVD are much better.  They go back to Jillian's standard 30-second intervals, and keep things interesting!

And in case you haven't heard: Jillian Michaels is EFFECTIVE.  If you want to tone up or lose weight or both, GET THESE.  In fact, build yourself a Jillian Michaels library.  I know I have.  Don't just do cardio, despite common wisdommaximize your results by alternating cardio and strength training.  My most recommended workouts: Beginner Shred, Ripped in 30, and the Killer series (advanced).  But I have nearly all of her DVDs.  Incredible, transformative workouts!  You'll get so much fitter so fast, you won't even believe it.  Guaranteed.

UPDATE: I finally bought this disc, too, just because it's so convenient to have all 3 cardio workouts on one DVD.  (My biggest complaint about the Bodyshred & Body Revolution series is that you have only 1 workout on each DVD.  Huge waste of space in my DVD case.)

If replacing the Body Revolution Series (in only 3 discs):
 Pair Cardio 1 with Beginner Shred 1 & 2  for 1-3 weeks
 Pair Cardio 2 with Beginner Shred 3 and Ripped in 30 workouts 1 & 2  for 2-6 weeks
 Pair Cardio 3 with Ripped in 30 workouts 3 & 4  for as long as you want :)
These don't isolate upper and lower body, though.  To do that, either buy the series or invest in parts of the Killer series or Kickbox Fastfix.",1511654400,4,2084,4.73463687150838
