8285765,1,B001C3YX7U,This movie was just odd and nasty! Grandpa sleeping with his daughter and granddaughter. Not much talking in the movie. Just bad.,1467331200,,129,4.909090909090909
8285766,2,B001C3YX7U,"Altho I originally purchased a copy of this flik back when it was first released in 2007 I'm just getting around to reviewing it now - because - I just watched it again and was reminded of my initial somewhat negative impressions of it - which I thot to share with other potential purchasers.

This is an Italian effort starring Tiffany Shepis in the role of 'Sarah' - an American student who comes to an Italian nunnery looking to find God - but winds up undergoing a bunch of horrific tortures at the hands of the 'good sisters' (and their 'doctor') that are supposed to 'help' her in her 'spiritual quest'. These medical 'procedures' are designed to rid the novitiate of her 'troubling' senses of hearing, sight, touch, and speech. In Sarah's case the removal of her ear-drums, eyesight (via acid drops). hands (via scalding in boiling water), AND tongue! - actually have the effect of heightening her extra-sensory powers so that she becomes ultra-sensitive and clairvoyant to both her present surroundings and also to some ghostly flash-backs to previous evil-doings at the convent.

This all might sound like a recipe for some good nasty nunsploitation style 'fun'. but in the hands of Director/writer/producer/cinematographer/editor: Ivan Zuccon it all becomes a confusing and, ultimately, un-engaging slog.

I am personally not as familiar with the works of lead actress Tiffany Shepis as other reviewers appear to be so I have no other films to base a comparison on, but she is competent in this role, and has no aversion to removing her clothing when the plot so requires.

The 'negatives' that struck me about the production were, unfortunately, abundant. For starters - it might be noted that the actual name of the character within the movie (that the title is based upon) is: 'Ninfa' NOT 'Nympha' per the box cover. This is an obvious ploy to attract viewers via the connotation to 'nymphomania' - a condition of female sexual insatiability that plays no role in this screenplay... but who is gonna be attracted to a movie called ""Ninfa""?! There are a LOT of pretty glaring incongruities within the film - perhaps the most annoying is the choice of the lead 'bad guy' actor who sports an English/Aussie? accent in the midst of all the Italian ambiance. The director also doesn't handle the injection of the tale of 'Ninfa' into the plot very well as it is 'revealed' through the extra-sensory perceptions of the tortured Sarah - it is very confusing as to the time line of events and the reality of what's happening in 'flash-backs v/s 'visions'. The visual quality of the 'film' is also a little compromised as this is a 'shot on hi-def' video product that occasionally looks as such and detracts from the general 'reality' of the piece.

On the positive side of the equation, however, the production values are decent and the performances adequate. As previously noted - there is a fair amount of female flesh on display in various scenes of love-making of both the hetero and lesbo variety.

But in the final analysis my over-all impression was one of 'annoyance' at the confusing quagmire of concepts and images that the director was foisting on the audience and I was sorta 'happy' when the end credits rolled - not a 'good thing' for an exploitation flik! Worth a look (mostly for Ms Shepis body) - but more of a renter than a keeper, in my opinion. On the technical side - a nice clean (digital) widescreen image - English lang. (mostly) there are numerous scenes where it is Italian w/ Eng. subs - a few light weight 'extras'.",1428019200,,3548,4.798690671031096

8285768,2,B001C3YX7U,"Tiffany Shepis (my favorite, and easily the hottest, and possibly the best independent horror actress working today) stars in this tale of a girl who is joining a seemingly sinister convent where the main doctrine of thou shalt not see, hear, speak, or feel are enforced in the most painful ways possible. But she must endure these mutilating trials so she can become closer to god. Instead of communicating with god these trials bring spooky visions of the nunnery's founder, and the burdens she endured. Shepis who usually plays the consummate, and frequently undressed bad-girl seemed to be playing against her character type in this flick as the quaint & quiet kind with almost no dialogue to speak of (get it?). She did great, as usual, which is the only credit to this flick, but this is not the way you want to see the fiery scream queen. A sensual lesbian scene is thrown in for good measure, and by good I mean outstanding, and no other reason. All the violence that takes place is onscreen, which is always a good thing, but not when it's cgi heavy. In the end the movie felt very slow & almost empty at times. A half hour could have easily been cut out to make it infinitely more thrilling than it was. (2.5 out 5)",1368057600,,1225,4.5225225225225225
8285769,4,B001C3YX7U,"NYMPHA stars horror-goddess, Tiffany Shepis (DELTA DELTA DIE!, THE HAZING, ABOMINABLE, HOME SICK) as Sarah, a woman in search of a deeper spiritual life. Unfortunately, she comes to the Sisters Of The New Order, a bizarre sect of nuns w/ dark, torturous ideas about God. I adore Ms. Shepis, and she's really good here. Her character is subjected to several hideous ordeals, resulting in bodily mutilation! NYMPHA is an ominous, bloody look at religious insanity. The ending is suitably twisted. Enjoy...",1305763200,,503,5.222222222222222
8285770,5,B001C3YX7U,"Italian cinema has always been some of my favorite. All the way from the greats like Argento and Fulci to the present indie Italian filmmaker Dante Tomaselli. Even though most of the films are mostly style over substance they all are very poetic and they put everything they have into each frame of film they shoot. Ivan Zuccon's NyMpha was a film that I had been aware for quite some time. I had also heard of his previous film Bad Brains. Unfortunately I had not seen either of them until just a few days ago.

NyMpha stars Tiffany Shepis who just so happens to be one of my favorite scream queens. Tiffany plays Sarah in this film who is a young English woman who is looking to get closer to her Lord. So she chooses to join a convent of nuns in Italy. Only this isn't your average run of the mill convent.. No way, these nuns are pretty damn hardcore and have some very extreme beliefs. In order to be one with God you must go through several tortuous levels that include ""hearing"", ""touching"", ""seeing"" and ""speaking"" with the Lord. As you can imagine the torture is not pretty.

But this is only a very small portion of what the movie contains. While Sarah is locked in her room between each session a previous inhabitant of the convent is showing her visions. Ninfa is revealing her past to Sarah through several short bursts of flashbacks. Ninfa's life was ruined by her insanely religious Grandfather. Her grandfather believes he can speak directly with God and begins a wild and dangerous spiral into insanity that ends up very detrimental to Ninfa's life.

I have to say that the most impressive thing to me about this film was the wonderful score that ran throughout. Richard Band who you may remember also did the music for the cult classic Re-Animator handled the score for this film as well. He managed to give this sense of dread throughout the entire picture. I was impressed as soon as the opening credits began without even seeing a frame of the actual film. Band is really that good. So I think he deserves a lot of credit and I hope to see him work with Zuccon in the future.

For people who love work from Argento, Fulci, Tomaselli and any other number of Italian directors this is definetly something you NEED to check out.",1305072000,2,2246,4.511056511056511
