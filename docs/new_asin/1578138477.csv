7799118,5,1578138477,"Kirika and Mirielle are assassins for hire. They'll rub out anyone for enough money. Kirika has anmesia. All she recalls is the skills she has as an assassin. A mafia organization has sanctioned them and sends hitmen to test their skills. What they don't know yet is that they are candidates to take the title of Noir, an ancient team of killers that is feared by the underworld.

Noir is a very stylish anime. The colors and the soundtrack create a very unique mood. The series has a lot of action and plenty of mystery. It's a very cool series. The characters are compelling and keep you wanting to watch more. I definitely think anyone, anime fan or not, can get a lot of enjoyment out of it.",1353974400,,695,4.4296875
