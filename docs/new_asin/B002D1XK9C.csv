3908723,2,B002D1XK9C,"The series is a US adaption of an esteemed British detective drama. Fitz (Robert Pastorelli) plays a psychologist who helps the police profile killers. The show is dark without a glimmer of light. The crimes are brutal and drawn out. Fitz's life is a disaster on every front. No one in the entire cast is happy.

The show is called Cracker supposedly because Fitz can crack open the criminal psyche with ease and finesse.  Only this version seems more like guessing. If you are interested in detective shows which focus on criminal psychology, try Cracker (1993-1996), Wire in the Blood (both are very dark), or Law & Order: Criminal Intent.",1454112000,33,641,4.818181818181818

It is not a family show so I watch it while relaxing before going to bed at night.

3908729,4,B002D1XK9C,"Too bad this series did not last longer.  While not the best series ever made, it was entertaining, with an interesting central character, and pretty good scripts.",1384300800,,163,5.037037037037037
3908730,4,B002D1XK9C,Almost as riveting as the British version.  Some episodes are unique; probably created for an American audience and culture.  Definitely worth the price.,1345248000,5,153,5.608695652173913
3908731,5,B002D1XK9C,"This American adaptation of the British series CRACKER has been much, and unfairly, maligned for not being as good as its UK antecedent, but I think closer to the truth is people are upset at it simply not *being* the UK CRACKER, in the sense that it's not a direct parallel. But then, it isn't supposed to be. Nor should it have been. Headwriter/show runner James Sadwith did an excellent job of transposing creator Jimmy McGovern's British series to an American key. The tone is similar but not slavish, and while certain key characters are of course Americanized versions of the originals, other characters in the ensemble are new or composite; this is CRACKER reimagined comprehensively within an American sensibility. (And to emphasize how well the show delivers on its own terms, this was my first exposure to CRACKER; I delved into the UK original -- which is also extraordinary -- long after. Never through that initiation did I feel as if I were being shortchanged, nor was I confused as to the show's intention and style. Nor do I think you'll be disappointed.)

Furthermore, I submit that (the alas late) Robert Pastorelli's turn as the haunted, dissolute criminal psychologist Gerry ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald is every bit as compelling as Robbie Coltrane's Eddie ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald. Though a man of somewhat smaller physical stature, Pastorelli has the same-but-different bigness of personality and easy facility for grandness of gesture that's endemic to Coltrane. I live in NYC where I'm a constant theatregoer and I've seen many a production numerous times to experience new cast members -- for example, in AMADEUS I saw three brilliant Salieris: Ian McKellan, Frank Langella and David Dukes -- and there's a similar thrill awaiting any who open mindedly experience both Pastorelli and Coltrane. Each is a brilliant virtuoso bringing his own unique imprimatur to the role. The contrast is profound, yet at the core, both ARE Fitz, not merely playing him, but inhabiting him, and for me it's impossible to say who has the more iconic spin.",1287014400,29,2044,5.0294985250737465

Expressed views on human sexuality tended to focus on the population littering objectives of slave mongering ""religion"" gangs and/or on their demand for destructive substitutes for satisfaction of the human desire for connectivity.  Religionist demands were emphasized in the murders of the cop who had a vasectomy to defeat population littering and the purported promiscuous female (who was clearly less active than those kidnapped and imprisoned by a religionist offal in Italy to prevent any decent treatment of male citizens to contravene their central theme of torture maiming and murder of males).

3908738,1,B002D1XK9C,"I am writing this after only 8 minutes into this absurd series. I will continue to watch, hoping that it has SOME redeeming characteristics, but this is no ""Cracker."" I love the Robbie Coltrane series and this is clearly not it. I have NO idea why someone would claim to cover that superb TV show, which I first saw in London, but whoever it is is misguided and puerile. Perhaps if he/she/they (I can't be bothered to figure it out) had actually watched the original, someone would have realized that it is not duplicable. Call it something else, but DON'T call it ""Cracker"" - this is an actionable insult to the original. Let it stand on its own merits (if there are any)- but ""To Say I Love You"" was a masterpiece, and even  2 minutes in, I could tell that this was no masterpiece. Shame on whoever decided to do this remake. I may come back after I have seen this first episode to make further comments, but I would bet a gazillion dollars that they would not be positive.",1502236800,2,975,4.386740331491713

3908742,5,B002D1XK9C,"I am watching this on prime and completely mesmerized. The series is not at all predictable and fascinating! If you like behavior you will find this to be wildly addictive. Moreover the lead character spills references to movies and Skinner, etc, that make it impossible to find any part of a show boring.

I just thought pastorelli made his character more appealing and more likeable despite his character flaws whereas the brit series  made me want to shut the tv off and walk away. He failed to make me want to understand and accept the flaws of his portrayal of the character..

3908761,3,B002D1XK9C,"I love watching crime dramas. I haven't seen the UK version, I usually watch the British version of a program before a US adaptation.

Love the genius behind character personalities like Pastorelli's Fitz. BUT, he's sometimes so over the top, and full of himself - great job to get such a reaction to a character by a viewer. I almost can't take watching scenes that are so repeatedly annoying, i.e., the family dinner scenes and the dynamics between Fitz and his wife. I tolerate watching these scenes or fast forward. His character is such a JERK and watching the wife who gives the impression that she can set boundaries and keeps going back for more. These scenes add nothing to the show, feel imbalanced and aimless, and family dysfunction overload. Might make for good material to break someone down to go to Al-Anon, AA, Gambling Anonymous, go cold turkey, stop being a jerk or watch a different show. Does make me think of Vincent D'Onofrio and his character presence on Law and Order/ability to get into the criminal mind. That show does a much better job including personal dysfunction where it plays a side role in Law and ORder vs ""fighting"" for a foothold in Cracker.",1471651200,3,1180,4.728155339805825
3908762,3,B002D1XK9C,"Well acted but rather predictable stories. And every time I see Pastorelli I picture him as Jimmy Detillo in ""Striking Distance"".  (His character was less obnoxious in that movie than in this series!)  The British version of ""Cracker"" is  better than its US counterpart although it does seem to have an anti American bent at times. Still, this is worth a look-see.",1470441600,,364,4.838709677419355
3908763,4,B002D1XK9C,Great adaptation of the English mystery season. The crimes were challenging to try to solve before Fitz. The only complaint I have is that Fitz himself is a thoroughly horrible character. He fancies himself a psychologist and counselor. He is a drama queen and would probably  benefit by a stint on a psychiatrist's couch himself.,1469404800,,330,5.0

3908766,5,B002D1XK9C,I REALLY LIKE BRITISH DRAMA AND THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE BRITISH DRAMA AS I ENJOYED THE BRITISH CRACKER SERIES VERY MUCH - A COMPLEX PSYCHOLOGICAL DETECTIVE SOLVING COMPLICATED CRIMES SCENARIOS - THEN FOUND OUT THAT THE BRITISH CRACKER WAS BASED ON THIS USA SERIES OF A SORT OF PROFILER DETECTIVE  CRACKER - WHO WAS GOOD AT HIS JOB BUT HIGHLY UNUSUAL IN HIS PROCEDURAL METHODS - THE USA DETECTIVE CRACKER IS EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE THAN THE BRITISH DETECTIVE CRACKER AS HIS ENGLISH IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE AND THE BRITISH CRACKER IS SOMETIMES A BIT DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER - TOO BAD IT WAS ONLY A SHORT SERIES - QUITE ENJOYABLE AND THE DVDS WERE PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL.,1456963200,,662,4.807017543859649
3908767,3,B002D1XK9C,"I do like the stories.  But I also want Fitz to just be quiet for a second with his dull self-centered self-important pop psychology.  He talks too much and what he says half the time is offensive and irrelevant.  He probably thinks the way he talks to his wife is somehow enlightening.  He's just another batterer and why she or the detective he works with want to work things out....well, it's not their fault he is who he is.

3908772,2,B002D1XK9C,"I agree with Lily. Disappointment set in halfway through this first episode. I did not like Fritz's wife at all. I thought she was an unncessary character and did not add to the script. Her job was to be a filler; someone just there to take up vacant space. I guess she did provide a third dimention to keep Fritz occupied or depressed or off-balance...not sure what her real purpose was. It may have been acceptable in 1999 for the mother (Fritz's wife) of the missing son to hang around police headquarters and allowed to badger her husband (Fritz) and the other female police oficer, but I found that to be totally inappropriate and unbelievable. I did not like the interaction among members of the police force and detectives and I do not believe that law officers act like egomaniacs amongst themselves; it was almost as if each one was vieing to be ""it.""
