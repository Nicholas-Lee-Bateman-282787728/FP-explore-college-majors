8366225,5,B0019CSH26,"This is / was an awesome series on Australia television (ABC).  A fantastic 'real life look' at what it means for women to hit your 30s (or even 40s) and find you want a family but there are none in the immediate offering.  4 stories track 4 very different pathways to family and life choices (with some unexpected twists).  Excellent storytelling with a cast of excellent actors (including David Wenham even before ""Sea Change"" fame).  Well worth watching - heart breaking at moments, uplifting in others, very funny in some (watch for the turkey basting scene).",1220832000,,563,4.833333333333333
