7851979,5,630365150X,"This is the origin of the film series and cultural phenomenon that is James Bond.  Sean Connery defined James Bond in Dr. No and proceeded to set a bar that complicated the lives of every other Bond actor that had to follow him.  In the set you can see the universal conventions of Bond that set over time but also see the flexibility in story lines that allowed the Bond series to remain very topical.  It's fun to start at the beginning and watch the series tone and sensibility change slowly over time.
Each of the DVDs has additional bonuses such as documentaries on everything from the Bond girls to the effects to Ian Fleming and other goodies such as theatrical trailers and music videos.
If you really love Bond you should own them all so that you can visit your favorite Bond actors and stories over and over again.",1187049600,2,824,4.48
