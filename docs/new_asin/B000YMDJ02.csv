3033428,5,B000YMDJ02,"I have. For many years, and many years ago. The situation has two sides, and seeing the big picture does not mean that one is either Anti and For, just able to feel the pain and unjust of both parties.

This film is amazing.
The soundtrack, which is out in Israel, is awesome too.

After all, it's all about relationships and how we communicate.",1203465600,9,345,4.375
3033429,4,B000YMDJ02,"The Israeli/Palestinian conflict persists and while the world may be aware of the violence surrounding the division of the two countries, few have a clue to the other aspect of the division - the group of people who want peace and work toward eradicating the separation. Eytan Fox, in THE BUBBLE ('Ha-Buah'), has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the schism, electing to tell a story that contains some fine humor, a lot of love, and a taste of brutal reality.  It is a window into a situation that begs for understanding.

In Tel Aviv three close friends are roommates: Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), a beautiful young woman with strong opinions; Yali (Alon Friedman), a very 'out' gay young man who works in a popular caf; and Noam (Ohad Knoller), a handsome, somewhat shy fellow who, in addition to his day job in a music shop, is a member of the National Guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city's checkpoints.  It is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young Palestinian named Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid), and a mutual attraction occurs. The three friends decide to 'stowaway' the illegally present Ashraf (whom they nickname with an Israeli name) and while Ashraf and Noam settle into a love relationship, Yali hires Ashraf at his caf, and Yali and Lulu both proceed to find love interests, too.  All goes well until Ashraf must return home for his sister's wedding. Though in Tel Aviv Ashraf has been able to be openly gay with Noam, life is far different in Jerusalem: Ashraf is told he must marry his sister's groom-to-be sister.  In an attempt to rescue Ashraf from his fate, Noam and Lulu disguise themselves as French reporters to gain access to Ashraf.  In a moment of supposed seclusion, Noam and Ashraf are discovered kissing by the groom-to-be, and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for Ashraf to remain 'in the closet'.

While the young people in Tel Aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence, an attack occurs in Jerusalem - one that has grave consequences not only immediately, but also in the revenge mission Ashraf must now assume.  The ending is tragic on many levels and it underlines just how serious the problem between these two countries is.

The acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people.  The story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes Eytan Fox such a fine writer/director.  More people should watch this important and very fine film.  In Hebrew, Arabic, and English with subtitles. Grady Harp, February 08",1203379200,24,2695,4.796976241900648
3033430,5,B000YMDJ02,"I've been a fan of Eytan Fox since I saw the tragic love story, ""Yossi and Jagger"".  I wasn't aware of ""The Bubble"" until I saw a review of it in a recent catalogue.  As luck would have it, a local video store just added a copy and I snatched it up.

Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed although I must admit, the inevitable ending broke my heart.  The story follows three young Israelis who share an apartment in Tel Aviv.  From their history, it seems there has been a revolving door of failed romances.  However, after a fateful meeting at a checkpoint between Noam, one of the roommates, and Ashraf, a Palestinian, a true love begins to blossom.  Fox makes the romance very real and watching the two young men from very different worlds fall in love is handled tenderly----a deep contrast to the violence that surrounds the city they live in (their perfect little ""bubble"").

Though Ashraf has no Israeli ID, the roommates keep him in their apartment and arrange a job for him to stay in the city.  Once his identity is blown, though, he panics and returns home to prepare for the upcoming wedding of his sister.  His sister, Rana, is engaged to Jihad, a radical, who believe terrorism is the means to getting the message across to the Israelis.  In a couple of horrible events that affects both Noam and Ashraf, the end of the two lovers short-lived utopia is set in motion.  The final scene between Noam and Ashraf was heart rendering and left me unsettled and wishing that the troubles in that very complex and volatile region could be solved once and for all.  But as Ashraf's voice over says ""They probably never will.""

Its a shame that the Oscars didn't recognize an amazing film like this in their ""foreign film"" category.  This film is as good as ""Brokeback Mountain"" or any of the other contenders and, in my opinion, shows their continued closed-mindedness to gay themed movies.  The moments between Noam and Ashraf are sincere and as loving as you'll see in any other film dealing with romance.  By the ending, you are praying the two will find a way to be together, away from the horrible killings and death that seems to be a part of every day life in the middle east.

Three of the actors were standouts.  Ohan Knoller, also of ""Yossi and Jagger"" is very good as the mellow, music loving Noam.  Knoller gives Noam a very layed back and easy going persona, who's also sensitive and kind.  He's a very charming actor and I look forward to seeing him in more roles.  Also, the beautiful and equally charming, Daniela Wircer, (as one character calls her ""an Israeli Carrie Bradshaw""), who is looking for Mr. Right but keeps ending up with losers (although Mr. Right is right under her nose!)  Finally, Yousef Sweid, as the handsome Palestinian who steals Noam's heart.  Sweid does a great job as a young man torn between his first real love and his culture, which views homosexuality with abhorrence and disdain.  His sister's reaction was so sad for me to watch, showing that this young man had no one in his corner in the world in which he grew up.

Some will find the ending very controversial but I found it just sad and an unfortunate reality of our world today.  I hope you will take time to see this movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  I will certainly be adding this film to my dvd collection.  Highly recommended.",1203120000,13,3348,4.533333333333333
3033431,5,B000YMDJ02,"The Israeli movie ""The Bubble"", a creation of director Eytan Fuchs/Fox and his screenplay-writer husband of 18 years, is a MUST SEE.  I've had the DVD since August 2007, because I ordered the Region 2 (PAL) edition directly from Israel.  I like it even more every time I watch it.  In the film festival circuit, it has been getting standing ovations, and for good reason.

The film works well on a number of levels: It's a very touching gay love story, told without coyness or artifice. It's a very revealing glimpse into both sides of a conflict most of us only hear about on the news. It's a love letter to the modern, hedonistic city that is Tel Aviv. It's a portrait of a group of charming young friends who care deeply for each other, and who I found I really cared about too.

It's also a beautiful plea for peace.  At times funny, sad, touching, and always thought-provoking, it's a movie that stays in your thoughts long after it's over.

I have to say I like it even more than ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- which had a number of aspects I did not like.  Back in the days when I thought the Academy Awards actually meant anything, I might have hoped ""The Bubble"" would win Best Foreign Film.  But now that it's clear that an Oscar has no real meaning as an award for true quality, I hope the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs will step in and fill the gap.

No one lives in a Bubble!",1380672000,,379,4.626865671641791
3033440,4,B000YMDJ02,"The love story depicted in this film is very touching and goes against the grain of acceptability for the two cultures these two men come from. Not only is their homosexuality not accepted by both cultures -- more or less -- but their cross religious love affair, Jewish and Palestinian, also cuts across the grain for both cultures. Yet there was something quite satisfying to watch in the film as you see ""teh gayz"" fighting against bigotry and homophobia endemic to their respective peoples and at least on the Israeli side of the divide, reflecting the divide between those of Israeli society who accept their homosexual brethren and sisters, and those still mired in the medieval thinking of ages past. I was ecstatic to see young Israelis confronting their countrymen head-on and staging a rave on the beach where any and all could come and have a great time.
It was also a surprising movie at times when unexpected scenarios pop up, such as the scenes depicting an ""undercover TV reportage event in the West Bank,"" ostensibly to cover a wedding, but really just to get in touch with the missing lover. The consequences of that prank end up going terribly wrong, but who could have imagined that when they first cooked up this plot twist?
The ending was more like the ubiquitous ending of too many of these Israeli-Palestinian tales of star-crossed lovers. I will leave it at that so as not to ruin the film for those who have not yet watched it. I gave it four stars, not because it is not a great film that deserves five, but because I was disappointed by the lack of creativity in dealing with the end. Perhaps there is no alternative denouement to these tales of unrequited love under the current political climate. But I would have loved to see the director try to find a better place to suggest we all strive for other than the trite and hackneyed one we are all already way to familiar with. But I do love the film, for the acting is superb while the cinematography is praiseworthy for how it captures the essence of modern Israel and Palestine as a backdrop for their love affair. I have never been to the Middle East, but am fascinated by the place with its ancient history and ongoing turmoil. I hope to travel there sometime in the remaining years of life I have. The possibilities advanced by the director for the potential acceptance of the ""enemy""  and the bridging of the great chasm that currently separates them politically and religiously gives one hope for the future. I hope that the next movie along these lines will be able to proffer an alternative ending of hope and love, instead of the current one of hatred and ignorance. I highly recommend this film to all who love a good love story and a challenging plot line. Definitely worth the eyeballs....",1380499200,,2780,4.63894523326572

I was completely blown away by the depth and beauty of this film; it's subtext layered upon subtext, and days later I am still thinking through the levels of metaphor employed in it.

3033451,5,B000YMDJ02,"At an Israeli checkpoint, Palestinian Arabs wait to be subjected to humiliating, if necessary, body searches.  Suicide bombers are terrorizing Israeli cities.  A young Israeli conscript meets eyes with an equally attractive Palestinian.  A scream shatters the silence. A woman is going into labor. Both the conscript and the young man cooperate to help the woman until a doctor can arrive.  Moments later, the baby is born, stillborn.

With this brilliant metaphor for a seemingly endless conflict, director/screenwriter team (and life partners) Eytan Fox and Gal Uschovsky, have once again crafted an intelligent, emotion-rich film 2006`s, `The Bubble.`Like its predecessor, `Walk on Water,` `The Bubble` is a complex and engaging look into Israel`s baffling chaos through a variety of lenses: Jew/Arab, soldier/civilian, male/female, gay/straight.  And through all of these runs a thread of a deeply shared humanity.  The Fox/Uschovsky team`s message is simple and universal: salvation lies in realizing our common human core.

Light romantic comedy (gay and straight), a family drama and a heart-wrenching tragedy are all here in this quirky gem.  The four main characters and the talented actors/actresses behind them are what make `The Bubble` the dynamic, deep-reaching story it is.  The cute boyish Ohad Knoller plays the sensitive, introspective Noam, a music store clerk who spends his weekends with the IDF on checkpoint patrol.  His Palestinian connection is Ashraf, played by the handsome and super-talented Yousef Sweid. After their initial meeting, Ashraf shows up at Noam`s apartment returning Noam his identity card left at the checkpoint.  There, Ashraf meets Noam`s equally charming friends/roommates, Yali, the coy restauranteur  played by Alon Friedman and the charming and captivating Lulu (the super photogenic Daniella Wircer).  Together they all live in Tel Aviv`s arty, progressive Shenkin district.  Strongly against the occupation and war in general, they all support Noam in his efforts to keep Ashraf in the city illegally.  After an artfully rendered love scene, Noam and Ashraf soon become inseparable.  Paralleling them is Lulu`s unrequited infatuation for a local celebrity journalist and Yali`s budding romance for a super-macho ex-soldier, Golan.

The heart of `The Bubble` focuses on the interplay of all these relationships.  Lulu gets revenge on her heartless latour and finds her true beau in the process, while Yali succumbs to the charms of the gauche Golan.  Yet, it is Noam and Ashraf`s story that defines the film.  As their commitment to one another deepens, they cross taboo lines in Israeli society, most of all, that of love between Arab and Jew.  Ashraf, happy to be near Noam, must still answer to the culture he left behind in the Occupied Territories.  He must come out in a deeply homophobic culture and the film`s dramatic arc comes full circle when Ashraf opens up to his beloved sister.

Yet, this is Israel and horrific realities soon shatter Noam and Ashraf`s growing love.  Fox & Uschovsky are masters at complicating things when a happy end appears imminent.  As a suicide bomb nearly kills Yali, Noam puts his friends before his new love.  And when tragedy strikes Ashraf`s family, he vows revenge.  Yet, the two lovers are doomed to meet again, forced to face what is truly important.

The heart-wrenching ending demands that same suspension of disbelief as did `Walk on Water.`  Ultimately though, `The Bubble` follows a sacred tradition by honoring those who dare to give up everything for love.  Funny, entertaining, and thought-provoking, `The Bubble` will ultimately leave you hopeful despite the tears.  Take a chance on this little-known film. You will be rewarded a thousand-fold for doing so. Shalom. Salaam.",1366934400,2,3779,5.341793570219966
3033452,4,B000YMDJ02,"I thought ""The Bubble"" was a film that didn't start promising much, but ended up leaving me gasping. Noam is Jewish and Ashraf is Muslim. They spot each other at a checkpoint and when Ashraf finds Noam at his appartment in Tel Aviv to return Noam's wallet their love story begings.

I didn't enjoy very much the first half of the movie. It was rather slow and it seemed to focus mostly on the life of young Israeli in Tel Aviv, where, in fact, they live in a western-style bubble. Under a Jewish name, Ashraf, who speaks Hebrew like a native, and pretending to be from Israel, finds a job in Tel Aviv and both he and Noam have a love story.

However, Ashraf decides to go back home in the West Bank because of his sister's wedding and because of how unlikely their relationship is to progress, and Noam decides to fight for this relationship. This is when the second half of the film really takes off and becomes interesting. Not only we get to see the difficulties of a gay love story between a Muslim and a Jewish, but we are also exposed to the non-sense of the current conflict and to the intolerance of homosexuality in the Muslim world.

Had it not been for how slow and vague concerning the real plot of the film was during the first half, I would have given this film 5 stars. The second part is solid in depth and is very engaging, and the ending is unexpected and breathtaking, so I think this film absolutely deserves no less than 4 stars.",1365724800,,1450,4.343173431734317

3033461,5,B000YMDJ02,"""The Bubble"" is a powerful film from Israeli director Eytan Fox.  It is a story of life, love, friendship, politics, religion, homophobia, ethnic conflicts and just about anything else you can think of, set in violence-torn Palestine.  Three liberal Israeli roommates (two gay men and a straight woman) in Tel Aviv take in a Palestinian man who is in the country illegally.  They provide a home, a job, and their friendship and love.  Unfortunately for them, their love cannot overcome the hatred of the world around them, and the film comes to a shocking, completely unexpected conclusion.

There isn't much to say about the film, except that every aspect of it is superb: the directing, writing, cinematography, music, and especially the performances of the four lead actors are pitch-perfect.

In a scene that echoes the opening street brawl between the House of Montague and the House of Capulet in Romeo & Juliet, The Bubble begins during an altercation at an Israeli checkpoint. The Palestinian travelers are squabbling with the gruff Israeli soldiers over their treatment, when a woman goes into labor. A young soldier, Noam (Ohad Knoller), tries to deliver the baby, while Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) translates for him and comforts the woman. They notice each other in the moment, but part ways immediately when the baby is born dead.

A disillusioned Noam returns to civilian life, and is enjoying his time with his flat mates when Ashraf appears and returns the Israeli's lost passport. The two go up to the roof of the building, and their relationship takes off from there - in explicit visuals I might add. For those who are wondering about love scenes, gay or otherwise, this movie has both. If male or female nudity, or male-male love scenes truly bother you, you'll probably want to steer clear of The Bubble, though in doing so you will miss a good movie.

The performance of Yousef 'Joe' Sweid is heartbreakingly wonderful and can't help but draw the viewer in. He portrays an endearing innocence in a world hostile to everything Ashraf is, without the character feeling forced or contrived. Such a character not carefully handled can easily appear quaint, and even idiotic to an audience, but here you come to care for a man who seemingly has obstacles at every point on the compass.

It's acting well done, and Sweid is not alone. Daniella Wircer (also sometimes credited as  Daniela Virtzer) imbues the token girl friend/flame dame role with a great deal of zest and the two other male leads give good turns in their roles. You start to think of them as family - the way the characters view themselves. They are young, and almost ridiculously idealistic, but they instill hope in the viewer, even when we know how star-crossed love stories play out.

If you've an open mind, it's two hours well spent.",1253577600,13,2298,4.80506329113924

3033470,4,B000YMDJ02,"'The Bubble' is at its best when detailing the everyday life of idealistic, self-absorbed young Tel Aviv residents who feel removed from the harsher realities of the Israeli/Arab conflict. The scenes depicting the sweet, somewhat dreamy romance that unfolds between Noam, an Israeli reservist and record store clerk, and Ashraf, a Palestinian, are a pleasure to watch unfold. One of my favorite scenes is when Noam first introduces Ashraf to his roommates, and then takes Ashraf up to the rooftop and introduces him to his city.""Tel Aviv, Ashraf; Ashraf, Tel Aviv"".

Fans of Eytan Fox's earlier movie 'Yossi and Jagger' will be happy to see Ohad Knoller (Noam) portray another star-crossed lover. But while part of the charm of 'Yossi and Jagger' was the sometimes charged interactions between the effusive Jagger and the reserved Yossi, the romance between Noam and Ashraf is more muted. Noam tells Ashraf that they are ""explosive"" together, but their passion is more talked about than seen. I thought it would have been more interesting, and more believable, if Ashraf and Noam had argued about music, politics, religion, ANYTHING. Instead, they seem to be a couple completely devoid of conflict.

The charming romance ends abruptly soon after Ashraf returns to Nablus for his sister's wedding and a chain of events is unleashed that will change the lives of all of its characters. It is here when the movie begins to falter. I thought the final third of the movie was marred by too many improbable coincidences and by an implausible and, to my mind, nihilistic ending.

Even with these flaws, I would still recommend 'The Bubble', because it has more spirit and life in it than many more well-crafted movies do.",1235606400,3,1714,5.007017543859649
3033471,5,B000YMDJ02,"As evidenced by the differences in some of the reviews posted here on Amazon, the subject matter of the film mirrors the tension and dissent of the political landscape it's told on. Some people love this movie and others are shocked and bothered by parts or the whole. It provokes such heated responses whichever side you fall on. I think this means the director's insight and point of view on the Arab/Israeli conflict, as seen through the eyes of two gay men from each side who unexpectedly fall in love, is a unique and important addition to gay cinema. Whether you think any or all of the film is plausible or not, the strength of the story carries you along as the two main characters meet, fall in love, and then struggle with the inevitable challenges of being from opposite sides of a centuries long struggle, in addition to being closeted about being gay. I learned, as others have noted here, that LGBT life in both the Palestinian territory, and a country like Israel, can be quite different from what we in North America and Western Europe have become used to (and take for granted sometimes) as the gay liberation movement soldiers on delivering rights and freedoms, leaps and bounds ahead of more traditional and conservative parts of the world. In the Middle East, this film makes clear that love (both gay and straight) is even more complicated when you live in a constantly volatile and unsettling place. The parallels between the tension and volatility of love, and it's mirror tension in politics, to me makes this an important story told well. As a film it is strong comment from a left leaning Israeli voice, and as an addition to queer cinema I think it will be regarded as a seminal story like some of the other films it has been compared to in the reviews posted (Brokeback Mountain, Boys in the Band, etc.,). I would highly recommend it as this story brings thought provoking and well crafted gay cinema one step forward, in my opinion.",1232236800,3,1961,4.670520231213873
3033472,5,B000YMDJ02,"This movie achieves so much. At its core, it is a retelling of Romeo and Juliet. The two main characters come from opposite ends of their society and experience an especially forbidden love. The movie explores that love and its implications while providing a commentary on the harsh reality of modern life in Israel. The political and literal state of life in a war zone is on full display and shows the pain, fear and anger of all players. The director manages to reveal the underlying temperament of Arab and Israeli societies while clearly presenting the sometimes surrealistic denial of the nation's situation that one finds in the ""island"" of Tel Aviv. The title refers to that state of separation that Tel Aviv perpetuates but it also refers to the characters' suspension in a miasma of war. This is a great film as a love story, a gay love story, a snapshot of Israeli life, and as a commentary about the human heart and it's capacity for love and pain.",1231891200,3,960,4.652941176470589

3033474,4,B000YMDJ02,"The '07 Israeli film `The Bubble' was at times a rather difficult film for me to watch. The reason for my difficulty has nothing to do with the quality of filmmaking or acting, it's the homosexual content within the storyline. Not being of the gay persuasion this is the first film I've watched which displays physical contact between two males (no I haven't seen `BrokeBack Mountain'). Movies such as the `70's cult classic `The Boys in the Band' are easier to deal with, discussing homosexuality is not by any means the same as observing the physical act.

To be honest what initially drew me to `The Bubble' was the beautiful, unknown young woman on the cover (Daniela Virtzer), the subject matter of life in modern day Israel (Tel Aviv) and the explosive relationship between Jew and Arab as seen from an insiders perspective.

Now after watching `The Bubble' in its entirety I must admit that this is indeed a finely crafted, beautifully delivered tale of life, love and Middle East politics that's definitely worth viewing. The storyline is superb, the cast excellent and the ending poignant and totally unpredictable. Definitely not for everyone, especially children but if your open minded and looking for something challenging, thought provoking and surprisingly tender give this one a try.

P.S.: The sexual sequences are actually quite discreet and lacking in that overt, voyeuristic shock factor that might keep viewers away.",1216684800,6,1437,5.080508474576271
3033475,4,B000YMDJ02,"The lead actors in The Bubble and the characters they play are all appealing, and the film provided a look at Tel Aviv that I, pretty much an outsider to Israeli culture and politics, had never seen before. It was particularly interesting to learn about a youth movement in Israel that is sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians;  one does not always hear about this movement when reading about Israel in the American press. Characters' observations about living in ""a bubble"" wherein idealism, intellectuality, and tolerance seem to insulate people from harsh realities in life are well taken.

The two male leads have a sweetly depicted romance that moves the film forward. The romantic/sexual explorations of two secondary characters provide comic relief and insight into the vexing foibles of 20 something love in a big city; these secondary situations are two-dimensional, though, and don't contribute as much to the film as the central relationship between a young Jewish Israeli guy and a Muslim Palestinian.

As is the case in Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story, The Bubble is melodrammatic in its resolution of the forbidden relationship between ""star-crossed lovers.""  That said, the movie is enjoyable as a love story, as an introduction on a personal level to the emotional nuances of Israeli-Palestianian politics, and as an affirmation that there can be moral beauty in a loving relationship between two men--even when the world is hostile to the relationship.",1212624000,,1477,5.167364016736402
3033476,4,B000YMDJ02,"As a big fan and proselytizer of Eytan Fox's 2004 smash hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-on-Water/dp/B0009YVBGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk on Water</a>, I rubbed my hands in anticipation to see that his follow-up, The Bubble, was now on DVD.  While this one doesn't measure up to 'Water,' it's definitely compulsory viewing for those of you who, if you're like me, enjoy great Israeli cinema.

Fox is a trenchant observer of Israeli/Arab conflicts.  In these last two films, he's poked his thumb in the eye of 'official' government policy in subtle but notable ways.  In 'Water,' he depicts Lior Ashkenazi's Mossad agent tiring of and eventually giving up his life of walled-off vigilance.  Here in 'The Bubble,' we see a group of young Israelis bond (unknowingly, for some) with a Palestinian compatriot.  [And, as an added bonus, we get Ashkenazi playing himself in a Tel Aviv performance of 'Bent'.  That was an outstanding touch by Fox.]

I think the film could have done with an ending slightly less melodramatic than what Fox has offered up here (can't really even hint at it here without giving it away).  Also, this film got made and released before 2006's fierce conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.  I wonder if that would have changed the movie, as skillfully written by Fox and longtime partner (professionally and otherwise) Gal Uchovsky.  The movie's title refers to Tel Aviv's walled-off ""life goes on"" verve as battles often rage just a scant distance away on the country's very close borders.  In the 2006 conflict, The Bubble must have seemed, to put it mildly, somewhat less disconnected from all that.

I especially liked the work turned in by Yousef Sweid here as 'Ashraf.'  He was Palestinian waiter 'Rafik' in 'Walk on Water.'

Now, here's my updated list of 'gotta see' pieces of Israeli cinema, presented in no particular order....other than 'The Syrian Bride,' which is first on the list because it's first in my mind:

As a representation of conflict in the Middle East, it paints a portrait of the human side of those caught in the mix of turmoil, those dreaming of a life of peace where they can simply be.  These are the images we rarely see in mainstream news, but are strung together in a beautiful film that will make you think and it will draw out feelings and emotions from all ends of the spectrum.

Inside ""The Bubble"" that is Tel Aviv, Lulu works in a beauty shop, Yali manages a trendy cafe and Noam works in a music store. The three share an apartment until a chance encounter with a palestinian named Ashraf sets things into motion. Noam and Ashraf fall in love, even as Yali feels pangs of jealousy, and the trio of room mates conspire to shelter Ashraf in Tel Aviv.

Of course, Ashraf can't stay undercover forever, and when he heads back to the West Bank to attend his sister's wedding to a terrorist. When his closet life gets discovered, he becomes trapped between the two worlds. The idealistic trio back in Tel Aviv have planned a rave for co-existence, all while Jihad, the groom to be, plans out an act of violence to perpetuate the conflict. The thin lines of cultural violence and revenge weave back and forth as ""The Bubble"" plunges towards its conclusion.

While the crossing threads can seem a bit too obviously absurd, ""The Bubble"" still moves at a steady pace. It hits all the emotional high points with expertise, with Noam's singing Tim Buckley's ""Song of the Siren"" being especially moving. The love story is a good fit, as Noam and Ashraf make a believable star-crossed couple. The soundtrack is strong throughout, incorporating Bright Eyes, Lloyd Cole and others.

Eytan Fox, in THE BUBBLE ('Ha-Buah'), has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the schism, electing to tell a story that contains some fine humor, a lot of love, and a taste of brutal reality.  It is a window into a situation that begs for understanding.

In Tel Aviv three close friends are roommates: Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), a beautiful young woman with strong opinions; Yali (Alon Friedman), a very 'out' gay young man who works in a popular caf; and Noam (Ohad Knoller), a handsome, somewhat shy fellow who, in addition to his day job in a music shop, is a member of the National Guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city's checkpoints.  It is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young Palestinian named Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid), and a mutual attraction occurs. The three friends decide to 'stowaway' the illegally present Ashraf (whom they nickname with an Israeli name) and while Ashraf and Noam settle into a love relationship, Yali hires Ashraf at his caf, and Yali and Lulu both proceed to find love interests, too.  All goes well until Ashraf must return home for his sister's wedding. Though in Tel Aviv Ashraf has been able to be openly gay with Noam, life is far different in Jerusalem: Ashraf is told he must marry his sister's groom-to-be sister.  In an attempt to rescue Ashraf from his fate, Noam and Lulu disguise themselves as French reporters to gain access to Ashraf.  In a moment of supposed seclusion, Noam and Ashraf are discovered kissing by the groom-to-be, and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for Ashraf to remain 'in the closet'.

While the young people in Tel Aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence, an attack occurs in Jerusalem - one that has grave consequences not only immediately, but also in the revenge mission Ashraf must now assume.  The ending is tragic on many levels and it underlines just how serious the problem between these two countries is.

The acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people.  The story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes Eytan Fox such a fine writer/director.  More people should watch this important and very fine film.  In Hebrew, Arabic, and English with subtitles. Grady Harp, February 08",1203379200,24,2695,4.796976241900648
3267927,5,B000YMDJ02,"I've been a fan of Eytan Fox since I saw the tragic love story, ""Yossi and Jagger"".  I wasn't aware of ""The Bubble"" until I saw a review of it in a recent catalogue.  As luck would have it, a local video store just added a copy and I snatched it up.

Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed although I must admit, the inevitable ending broke my heart.  The story follows three young Israelis who share an apartment in Tel Aviv.  From their history, it seems there has been a revolving door of failed romances.  However, after a fateful meeting at a checkpoint between Noam, one of the roommates, and Ashraf, a Palestinian, a true love begins to blossom.  Fox makes the romance very real and watching the two young men from very different worlds fall in love is handled tenderly----a deep contrast to the violence that surrounds the city they live in (their perfect little ""bubble"").

Though Ashraf has no Israeli ID, the roommates keep him in their apartment and arrange a job for him to stay in the city.  Once his identity is blown, though, he panics and returns home to prepare for the upcoming wedding of his sister.  His sister, Rana, is engaged to Jihad, a radical, who believe terrorism is the means to getting the message across to the Israelis.  In a couple of horrible events that affects both Noam and Ashraf, the end of the two lovers short-lived utopia is set in motion.  The final scene between Noam and Ashraf was heart rendering and left me unsettled and wishing that the troubles in that very complex and volatile region could be solved once and for all.  But as Ashraf's voice over says ""They probably never will.""

Its a shame that the Oscars didn't recognize an amazing film like this in their ""foreign film"" category.  This film is as good as ""Brokeback Mountain"" or any of the other contenders and, in my opinion, shows their continued closed-mindedness to gay themed movies.  The moments between Noam and Ashraf are sincere and as loving as you'll see in any other film dealing with romance.  By the ending, you are praying the two will find a way to be together, away from the horrible killings and death that seems to be a part of every day life in the middle east.

Three of the actors were standouts.  Ohan Knoller, also of ""Yossi and Jagger"" is very good as the mellow, music loving Noam.  Knoller gives Noam a very layed back and easy going persona, who's also sensitive and kind.  He's a very charming actor and I look forward to seeing him in more roles.  Also, the beautiful and equally charming, Daniela Wircer, (as one character calls her ""an Israeli Carrie Bradshaw""), who is looking for Mr. Right but keeps ending up with losers (although Mr. Right is right under her nose!)  Finally, Yousef Sweid, as the handsome Palestinian who steals Noam's heart.  Sweid does a great job as a young man torn between his first real love and his culture, which views homosexuality with abhorrence and disdain.  His sister's reaction was so sad for me to watch, showing that this young man had no one in his corner in the world in which he grew up.

Some will find the ending very controversial but I found it just sad and an unfortunate reality of our world today.  I hope you will take time to see this movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  I will certainly be adding this film to my dvd collection.  Highly recommended.",1203120000,13,3348,4.533333333333333
3267928,5,B000YMDJ02,"The Israeli movie ""The Bubble"", a creation of director Eytan Fuchs/Fox and his screenplay-writer husband of 18 years, is a MUST SEE.  I've had the DVD since August 2007, because I ordered the Region 2 (PAL) edition directly from Israel.  I like it even more every time I watch it.  In the film festival circuit, it has been getting standing ovations, and for good reason.

The film works well on a number of levels: It's a very touching gay love story, told without coyness or artifice. It's a very revealing glimpse into both sides of a conflict most of us only hear about on the news. It's a love letter to the modern, hedonistic city that is Tel Aviv. It's a portrait of a group of charming young friends who care deeply for each other, and who I found I really cared about too.

It's also a beautiful plea for peace.  At times funny, sad, touching, and always thought-provoking, it's a movie that stays in your thoughts long after it's over.

I have to say I like it even more than ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- which had a number of aspects I did not like.  Back in the days when I thought the Academy Awards actually meant anything, I might have hoped ""The Bubble"" would win Best Foreign Film.

Not only is their homosexuality not accepted by both cultures -- more or less -- but their cross religious love affair, Jewish and Palestinian, also cuts across the grain for both cultures. Yet there was something quite satisfying to watch in the film as you see ""teh gayz"" fighting against bigotry and homophobia endemic to their respective peoples and at least on the Israeli side of the divide, reflecting the divide between those of Israeli society who accept their homosexual brethren and sisters, and those still mired in the medieval thinking of ages past. I was ecstatic to see young Israelis confronting their countrymen head-on and staging a rave on the beach where any and all could come and have a great time.
It was also a surprising movie at times when unexpected scenarios pop up, such as the scenes depicting an ""undercover TV reportage event in the West Bank,"" ostensibly to cover a wedding, but really just to get in touch with the missing lover. The consequences of that prank end up going terribly wrong, but who could have imagined that when they first cooked up this plot twist?
The ending was more like the ubiquitous ending of too many of these Israeli-Palestinian tales of star-crossed lovers. I will leave it at that so as not to ruin the film for those who have not yet watched it. I gave it four stars, not because it is not a great film that deserves five, but because I was disappointed by the lack of creativity in dealing with the end. Perhaps there is no alternative denouement to these tales of unrequited love under the current political climate. But I would have loved to see the director try to find a better place to suggest we all strive for other than the trite and hackneyed one we are all already way to familiar with. But I do love the film, for the acting is superb while the cinematography is praiseworthy for how it captures the essence of modern Israel and Palestine as a backdrop for their love affair. I have never been to the Middle East, but am fascinated by the place with its ancient history and ongoing turmoil. I hope to travel there sometime in the remaining years of life I have. The possibilities advanced by the director for the potential acceptance of the ""enemy""  and the bridging of the great chasm that currently separates them politically and religiously gives one hope for the future. I hope that the next movie along these lines will be able to proffer an alternative ending of hope and love, instead of the current one of hatred and ignorance. I highly recommend this film to all who love a good love story and a challenging plot line. Definitely worth the eyeballs....",1380499200,,2780,4.63894523326572

3267948,5,B000YMDJ02,"At an Israeli checkpoint, Palestinian Arabs wait to be subjected to humiliating, if necessary, body searches.  Suicide bombers are terrorizing Israeli cities.  A young Israeli conscript meets eyes with an equally attractive Palestinian.  A scream shatters the silence. A woman is going into labor. Both the conscript and the young man cooperate to help the woman until a doctor can arrive.  Moments later, the baby is born, stillborn.

With this brilliant metaphor for a seemingly endless conflict, director/screenwriter team (and life partners) Eytan Fox and Gal Uschovsky, have once again crafted an intelligent, emotion-rich film 2006`s, `The Bubble.`Like its predecessor, `Walk on Water,` `The Bubble` is a complex and engaging look into Israel`s baffling chaos through a variety of lenses: Jew/Arab, soldier/civilian, male/female, gay/straight.  And through all of these runs a thread of a deeply shared humanity.  The Fox/Uschovsky team`s message is simple and universal: salvation lies in realizing our common human core.

Light romantic comedy (gay and straight), a family drama and a heart-wrenching tragedy are all here in this quirky gem.  The four main characters and the talented actors/actresses behind them are what make `The Bubble` the dynamic, deep-reaching story it is.  The cute boyish Ohad Knoller plays the sensitive, introspective Noam, a music store clerk who spends his weekends with the IDF on checkpoint patrol.  His Palestinian connection is Ashraf, played by the handsome and super-talented Yousef Sweid. After their initial meeting, Ashraf shows up at Noam`s apartment returning Noam his identity card left at the checkpoint.  There, Ashraf meets Noam`s equally charming friends/roommates, Yali, the coy restauranteur  played by Alon Friedman and the charming and captivating Lulu (the super photogenic Daniella Wircer).  Together they all live in Tel Aviv`s arty, progressive Shenkin district.  Strongly against the occupation and war in general, they all support Noam in his efforts to keep Ashraf in the city illegally.  After an artfully rendered love scene, Noam and Ashraf soon become inseparable.  Paralleling them is Lulu`s unrequited infatuation for a local celebrity journalist and Yali`s budding romance for a super-macho ex-soldier, Golan.

The heart of `The Bubble` focuses on the interplay of all these relationships.  Lulu gets revenge on her heartless latour and finds her true beau in the process, while Yali succumbs to the charms of the gauche Golan.  Yet, it is Noam and Ashraf`s story that defines the film.  As their commitment to one another deepens, they cross taboo lines in Israeli society, most of all, that of love between Arab and Jew.  Ashraf, happy to be near Noam, must still answer to the culture he left behind in the Occupied Territories.  He must come out in a deeply homophobic culture and the film`s dramatic arc comes full circle when Ashraf opens up to his beloved sister.

Yet, this is Israel and horrific realities soon shatter Noam and Ashraf`s growing love.  Fox & Uschovsky are masters at complicating things when a happy end appears imminent.  As a suicide bomb nearly kills Yali, Noam puts his friends before his new love.  And when tragedy strikes Ashraf`s family, he vows revenge.  Yet, the two lovers are doomed to meet again, forced to face what is truly important.

The heart-wrenching ending demands that same suspension of disbelief as did `Walk on Water.`  Ultimately though, `The Bubble` follows a sacred tradition by honoring those who dare to give up everything for love.  Funny, entertaining, and thought-provoking, `The Bubble` will ultimately leave you hopeful despite the tears.  Take a chance on this little-known film. You will be rewarded a thousand-fold for doing so. Shalom. Salaam.",1366934400,2,3779,5.341793570219966
3267949,4,B000YMDJ02,"I thought ""The Bubble"" was a film that didn't start promising much, but ended up leaving me gasping. Noam is Jewish and Ashraf is Muslim. They spot each other at a checkpoint and when Ashraf finds Noam at his appartment in Tel Aviv to return Noam's wallet their love story begings.

I didn't enjoy very much the first half of the movie. It was rather slow and it seemed to focus mostly on the life of young Israeli in Tel Aviv, where, in fact, they live in a western-style bubble. Under a Jewish name, Ashraf, who speaks Hebrew like a native, and pretending to be from Israel, finds a job in Tel Aviv and both he and Noam have a love story.

However, Ashraf decides to go back home in the West Bank because of his sister's wedding and because of how unlikely their relationship is to progress, and Noam decides to fight for this relationship. This is when the second half of the film really takes off and becomes interesting. Not only we get to see the difficulties of a gay love story between a Muslim and a Jewish, but we are also exposed to the non-sense of the current conflict and to the intolerance of homosexuality in the Muslim world.

Had it not been for how slow and vague concerning the real plot of the film was during the first half, I would have given this film 5 stars. The second part is solid in depth and is very engaging, and the ending is unexpected and breathtaking, so I think this film absolutely deserves no less than 4 stars.",1365724800,,1450,4.343173431734317

3267958,5,B000YMDJ02,"""The Bubble"" is a powerful film from Israeli director Eytan Fox.  It is a story of life, love, friendship, politics, religion, homophobia, ethnic conflicts and just about anything else you can think of, set in violence-torn Palestine.  Three liberal Israeli roommates (two gay men and a straight woman) in Tel Aviv take in a Palestinian man who is in the country illegally.  They provide a home, a job, and their friendship and love.  Unfortunately for them, their love cannot overcome the hatred of the world around them, and the film comes to a shocking, completely unexpected conclusion.

There isn't much to say about the film, except that every aspect of it is superb: the directing, writing, cinematography, music, and especially the performances of the four lead actors are pitch-perfect.

3267964,4,B000YMDJ02,"I borrowed this from the local library without knowing anything more than provided by the description on the back of the box. I thought it would be some light, fluffy, Will-and-Grace type comedy, and was pleased to find instead a contemporary tale of star-cross'd lovers.

In a scene that echoes the opening street brawl between the House of Montague and the House of Capulet in Romeo & Juliet, The Bubble begins during an altercation at an Israeli checkpoint. The Palestinian travelers are squabbling with the gruff Israeli soldiers over their treatment, when a woman goes into labor. A young soldier, Noam (Ohad Knoller), tries to deliver the baby, while Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) translates for him and comforts the woman. They notice each other in the moment, but part ways immediately when the baby is born dead.

A disillusioned Noam returns to civilian life, and is enjoying his time with his flat mates when Ashraf appears and returns the Israeli's lost passport. The two go up to the roof of the building, and their relationship takes off from there - in explicit visuals I might add. For those who are wondering about love scenes, gay or otherwise, this movie has both. If male or female nudity, or male-male love scenes truly bother you, you'll probably want to steer clear of The Bubble, though in doing so you will miss a good movie.

The performance of Yousef 'Joe' Sweid is heartbreakingly wonderful and can't help but draw the viewer in. He portrays an endearing innocence in a world hostile to everything Ashraf is, without the character feeling forced or contrived. Such a character not carefully handled can easily appear quaint, and even idiotic to an audience, but here you come to care for a man who seemingly has obstacles at every point on the compass.

It's acting well done, and Sweid is not alone. Daniella Wircer (also sometimes credited as  Daniela Virtzer) imbues the token girl friend/flame dame role with a great deal of zest and the two other male leads give good turns in their roles. You start to think of them as family - the way the characters view themselves. They are young, and almost ridiculously idealistic, but they instill hope in the viewer, even when we know how star-crossed love stories play out.

If you've an open mind, it's two hours well spent.",1253577600,13,2298,4.80506329113924

3267967,4,B000YMDJ02,"'The Bubble' is at its best when detailing the everyday life of idealistic, self-absorbed young Tel Aviv residents who feel removed from the harsher realities of the Israeli/Arab conflict. The scenes depicting the sweet, somewhat dreamy romance that unfolds between Noam, an Israeli reservist and record store clerk, and Ashraf, a Palestinian, are a pleasure to watch unfold. One of my favorite scenes is when Noam first introduces Ashraf to his roommates, and then takes Ashraf up to the rooftop and introduces him to his city.""Tel Aviv, Ashraf; Ashraf, Tel Aviv"".

Fans of Eytan Fox's earlier movie 'Yossi and Jagger' will be happy to see Ohad Knoller (Noam) portray another star-crossed lover. But while part of the charm of 'Yossi and Jagger' was the sometimes charged interactions between the effusive Jagger and the reserved Yossi, the romance between Noam and Ashraf is more muted. Noam tells Ashraf that they are ""explosive"" together, but their passion is more talked about than seen. I thought it would have been more interesting, and more believable, if Ashraf and Noam had argued about music, politics, religion, ANYTHING. Instead, they seem to be a couple completely devoid of conflict.

The charming romance ends abruptly soon after Ashraf returns to Nablus for his sister's wedding and a chain of events is unleashed that will change the lives of all of its characters. It is here when the movie begins to falter. I thought the final third of the movie was marred by too many improbable coincidences and by an implausible and, to my mind, nihilistic ending.

Even with these flaws, I would still recommend 'The Bubble', because it has more spirit and life in it than many more well-crafted movies do.",1235606400,3,1714,5.007017543859649
3267968,5,B000YMDJ02,"As evidenced by the differences in some of the reviews posted here on Amazon, the subject matter of the film mirrors the tension and dissent of the political landscape it's told on. Some people love this movie and others are shocked and bothered by parts or the whole. It provokes such heated responses whichever side you fall on. I think this means the director's insight and point of view on the Arab/Israeli conflict, as seen through the eyes of two gay men from each side who unexpectedly fall in love, is a unique and important addition to gay cinema. Whether you think any or all of the film is plausible or not, the strength of the story carries you along as the two main characters meet, fall in love, and then struggle with the inevitable challenges of being from opposite sides of a centuries long struggle, in addition to being closeted about being gay. I learned, as others have noted here, that LGBT life in both the Palestinian territory, and a country like Israel, can be quite different from what we in North America and Western Europe have become used to (and take for granted sometimes) as the gay liberation movement soldiers on delivering rights and freedoms, leaps and bounds ahead of more traditional and conservative parts of the world. In the Middle East, this film makes clear that love (both gay and straight) is even more complicated when you live in a constantly volatile and unsettling place. The parallels between the tension and volatility of love, and it's mirror tension in politics, to me makes this an important story told well. As a film it is strong comment from a left leaning Israeli voice, and as an addition to queer cinema I think it will be regarded as a seminal story like some of the other films it has been compared to in the reviews posted (Brokeback Mountain, Boys in the Band, etc.,). I would highly recommend it as this story brings thought provoking and well crafted gay cinema one step forward, in my opinion.",1232236800,3,1961,4.670520231213873

The two main characters come from opposite ends of their society and experience an especially forbidden love. The movie explores that love and its implications while providing a commentary on the harsh reality of modern life in Israel. The political and literal state of life in a war zone is on full display and shows the pain, fear and anger of all players. The director manages to reveal the underlying temperament of Arab and Israeli societies while clearly presenting the sometimes surrealistic denial of the nation's situation that one finds in the ""island"" of Tel Aviv. The title refers to that state of separation that Tel Aviv perpetuates but it also refers to the characters' suspension in a miasma of war.

3267971,4,B000YMDJ02,"The '07 Israeli film `The Bubble' was at times a rather difficult film for me to watch. The reason for my difficulty has nothing to do with the quality of filmmaking or acting, it's the homosexual content within the storyline. Not being of the gay persuasion this is the first film I've watched which displays physical contact between two males (no I haven't seen `BrokeBack Mountain'). Movies such as the `70's cult classic `The Boys in the Band' are easier to deal with, discussing homosexuality is not by any means the same as observing the physical act.

To be honest what initially drew me to `The Bubble' was the beautiful, unknown young woman on the cover (Daniela Virtzer), the subject matter of life in modern day Israel (Tel Aviv) and the explosive relationship between Jew and Arab as seen from an insiders perspective.

Now after watching `The Bubble' in its entirety I must admit that this is indeed a finely crafted, beautifully delivered tale of life, love and Middle East politics that's definitely worth viewing. The storyline is superb, the cast excellent and the ending poignant and totally unpredictable. Definitely not for everyone, especially children but if your open minded and looking for something challenging, thought provoking and surprisingly tender give this one a try.

P.S.: The sexual sequences are actually quite discreet and lacking in that overt, voyeuristic shock factor that might keep viewers away.",1216684800,6,1437,5.080508474576271
3267972,4,B000YMDJ02,"The lead actors in The Bubble and the characters they play are all appealing, and the film provided a look at Tel Aviv that I, pretty much an outsider to Israeli culture and politics, had never seen before. It was particularly interesting to learn about a youth movement in Israel that is sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians;  one does not always hear about this movement when reading about Israel in the American press. Characters' observations about living in ""a bubble"" wherein idealism, intellectuality, and tolerance seem to insulate people from harsh realities in life are well taken.

The two male leads have a sweetly depicted romance that moves the film forward. The romantic/sexual explorations of two secondary characters provide comic relief and insight into the vexing foibles of 20 something love in a big city; these secondary situations are two-dimensional, though, and don't contribute as much to the film as the central relationship between a young Jewish Israeli guy and a Muslim Palestinian.

As is the case in Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story, The Bubble is melodrammatic in its resolution of the forbidden relationship between ""star-crossed lovers.""  That said, the movie is enjoyable as a love story, as an introduction on a personal level to the emotional nuances of Israeli-Palestianian politics, and as an affirmation that there can be moral beauty in a loving relationship between two men--even when the world is hostile to the relationship.",1212624000,,1477,5.167364016736402
3267973,4,B000YMDJ02,"As a big fan and proselytizer of Eytan Fox's 2004 smash hit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-on-Water/dp/B0009YVBGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk on Water</a>, I rubbed my hands in anticipation to see that his follow-up, The Bubble, was now on DVD.  While this one doesn't measure up to 'Water,' it's definitely compulsory viewing for those of you who, if you're like me, enjoy great Israeli cinema.

Fox is a trenchant observer of Israeli/Arab conflicts.  In these last two films, he's poked his thumb in the eye of 'official' government policy in subtle but notable ways.  In 'Water,' he depicts Lior Ashkenazi's Mossad agent tiring of and eventually giving up his life of walled-off vigilance.  Here in 'The Bubble,' we see a group of young Israelis bond (unknowingly, for some) with a Palestinian compatriot.  [And, as an added bonus, we get Ashkenazi playing himself in a Tel Aviv performance of 'Bent'.  That was an outstanding touch by Fox.]

I think the film could have done with an ending slightly less melodramatic than what Fox has offered up here (can't really even hint at it here without giving it away).  Also, this film got made and released before 2006's fierce conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.  I wonder if that would have changed the movie, as skillfully written by Fox and longtime partner (professionally and otherwise) Gal Uchovsky.  The movie's title refers to Tel Aviv's walled-off ""life goes on"" verve as battles often rage just a scant distance away on the country's very close borders.  In the 2006 conflict, The Bubble must have seemed, to put it mildly, somewhat less disconnected from all that.

I especially liked the work turned in by Yousef Sweid here as 'Ashraf.'  He was Palestinian waiter 'Rafik' in 'Walk on Water.'

Now, here's my updated list of 'gotta see' pieces of Israeli cinema, presented in no particular order....other than 'The Syrian Bride,' which is first on the list because it's first in my mind:

3267974,5,B000YMDJ02,"This is a beautiful film, because it captures the incomprehensible political situation in the Middle East in terms many of us can relate to. The characters are very believable and I found myself becoming very attached to them. That made the message of the film all the more difficult to take in. This film will be with me for a long time to come.",1210377600,2,346,4.421875
3267975,5,B000YMDJ02,"This is a truly amazing film on so many levels.  As a narrative, it is deeply poignant as you find yourself connecting with the characters in their joys, pains, frustrations, love and passions.  As a love story between two gay men across conflicting borders, it raises political and moral questions of citizenship and the role of the State.  As a representation of conflict in the Middle East, it paints a portrait of the human side of those caught in the mix of turmoil, those dreaming of a life of peace where they can simply be.  These are the images we rarely see in mainstream news, but are strung together in a beautiful film that will make you think and it will draw out feelings and emotions from all ends of the spectrum.  The Bubble is a blend of current events, politics, philosophy, excitement, sorrow, humor and wit, relationships, and much much more.  This is a true piece of art.",1208563200,8,894,4.591194968553459
3267976,4,B000YMDJ02,"Israeli director Eytan Fox has juggled films with sex and politics before (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yossi-Jagger/dp/B0001KNHAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yossi & Jagger</a>), but does so superbly in this tragic love story. Inside ""The Bubble"" that is Tel Aviv, Lulu works in a beauty shop, Yali manages a trendy cafe and Noam works in a music store. The three share an apartment until a chance encounter with a palestinian named Ashraf sets things into motion. Noam and Ashraf fall in love, even as Yali feels pangs of jealousy, and the trio of room mates conspire to shelter Ashraf in Tel Aviv.

Of course, Ashraf can't stay undercover forever, and when he heads back to the West Bank to attend his sister's wedding to a terrorist. When his closet life gets discovered, he becomes trapped between the two worlds. The idealistic trio back in Tel Aviv have planned a rave for co-existence, all while Jihad, the groom to be, plans out an act of violence to perpetuate the conflict. The thin lines of cultural violence and revenge weave back and forth as ""The Bubble"" plunges towards its conclusion.

While the crossing threads can seem a bit too obviously absurd, ""The Bubble"" still moves at a steady pace. It hits all the emotional high points with expertise, with Noam's singing Tim Buckley's ""Song of the Siren"" being especially moving. The love story is a good fit, as Noam and Ashraf make a believable star-crossed couple. The soundtrack is strong throughout, incorporating Bright Eyes, Lloyd Cole and others. Almost as good a film as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brokeback-Mountain/dp/B00005JOFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brokeback Mountain</a>, ""The Bubble"" is an excellent entry into international gay cinema.",1207440000,3,1807,5.688888888888889
