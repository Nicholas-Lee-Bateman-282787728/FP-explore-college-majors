1422302,4,B00005BGRP,"Well, if you're considering this DVD, hopefully, you've already seen the first four movies that comprise the first season of Lexx (this DVD is the first four episodes from the second season), otherwise you might not appreciate a program that takes some bearing-with to get into the swing of. All the humor of the first season carries over into the next 20 episodes of Lexx, and it just gets weirder. The second season does not quite have the satisfying depth of the first - while there is a story arc that carries across the season, it really is background except for the first episode, and the last few... there are a lot of one-shot stories that seem to focus more on the frightenly bizarre universe of the Dark Zone. The innuendo also gets cranked up a notch, with one episode taking place in a brothel satellite, another one seeing a character turning into a ...crazed cyborg, yet another having the Lexx crew switching genders and so on... this season is NOT for the kids! However, if one just sits back and enjoys each episode at face value, its still a mightily fine season. The camp factor during this season has been ramped up considerably, and while some of the episodes are outright silly, all in all its still a lot of fun.
Hardcore sci-fi fans may be put off by the camp humor, the patchy story, and the sexual content. However, if you're looking for a fun and silly ride, these are more or less exactly what makes this a worthwhile purchase. Fans of the Lexx universe might be caught off-guard by the second season, but I'd suggest bearing with it and enjoying it for what it is.",990662400,19,1593,4.534722222222222

7937363,5,B00005BGRP,"I am a huge fan of Lexx.  I really think it is one of the best shows I've ever seen on TV.  I got into it around the middle of the second season & became an addict after that.  I have all of the DVD's & have seen every episode (even the movies) multiple times.  I plan to review each DVD, each episode, one by one.  So here's my review for Series 2, Volume 1

Episode 2.1: Mantrid - The first of the TV series that takes place after the 4 mini-movies.  Although I would highly recommend you see the Mini-movies.  If you don't you won't be too lost, the show does a pretty good job of catching you up.  The is the episode where our main villian for Season 2 is introducted Mantrid.  Overall a very good episode, Mantrid is a cool character.  (Episode Rating: 4 out of 5)

Episode 2.2: Terminal - I think one of the sadest episodes of the entire series.  One of our beloved main characters dies at the hands of some crazy doctors.  Basically Stan gets hurt & they have to rush him to a hospital, they find one, but something is not right with the staff.  A great episode & if the death of the Crew member doesn't get you in tears, almost nothing will (Episode Rating: 5 out of 5)

Episode 2.3: Lyekka - Here we get introducted to a very important character in Season 2.  Lyekka, she is a plant who needs to eat a lot and she likes eating humans.  The Lexx crew is visted by some other people as well & chaos ensues.  Lyekka does come to be quite usefull though as shes brings back that deceased crew memeber, sort of.  A very funny & sexy episode. (Episode Rating: 5 out of 5)

Episode 2.3: Luvliner - The crew is very, shall we say, randy.  The get a message from the Luvliner, a place where you can get what you want for money.  They decide to go & get in a heap of trouble while they are there.  Basically because the guy who runs it & his friend try to steal the Lexx.  A hillarious episode, one of the funiest of the series (Episode Rating: 5 out of 5)

7937364,4,B00005BGRP,"4.5 stars.  I used to be a late-night channel-surfer, and one night I hit on a show that was simply too bizarre and original to ignore: ""The Lexx.""  I can honestly say I have never seen a more original show on television.  The three-and-a-half main characters are Stanley Tweedle(the proto-typical bumbling anti-hero looking for willing females), Kai(an undead former assassin for His Divine Shadow), 790(a robot head with a cynical nature and an all-consuming love for Zev/Xev), and Zev/Xev(a character played by two different alluring actresses who is a hybrid Love Slave/Cluster Lizard).  It's sounds confusing, I know.  If you are a newcomer to this series I would suggest starting with the first series Vol. 1 through Vol. 4 for a more comprehensive backstory.  The writers of this show were on drugs!!!  If anyone doubts this conclusion, just watch episode 2.3 entitled ""Lyekka.""  There is so much off-kilter imagery in that episode that it should be considered possible genius. There is also a lot of humor in this show, most of it sexual innuendo or pot-shots at Stanley Tweedle from 790 for being inadequate as a human being.  Some of the special effects are excellent, and other times they are phenomenally cheesy!  But the show is so much fun and so over-the-top weird that I have to give it a solid rating.  I simply can't give it 5 stars, however, because there are times when the transfer to DVD is incredibly grainy.  Most scenes look pristine, which makes those that are not look really bad.  Also, it was a mild shame that Eva Habermann(Zev) was only available to do the first 2 episodes.  As 790 said, she was ""Delicious!""  However, Xenia Seeberg(what a great name!) takes over and is equally attractive and she understands the character perhaps better than her counterpart.  This is a very original Sci-fi series.  I asked a collegue if he ever heard of the show, but he hadn't.  I told him ""It's like Sci-fi on acid!""  To me, that is the perfect description.  Don't do drugs!  Just watch The Lexx!!!",1081900800,,2019,4.811046511627907
7937365,5,B00005BGRP,"I don't mean to disappoint anyone who are LEXX fans. I am also a Lexx fan and it wasn't long that Brian Downey wrote me and told me that there will me no more Lexx. That includes spin-off ideas and animation ideas. He told me so after rejecting my first animated Lexx script called ""Stan's Dream"" as an addition to the live show ""The Net."" I was hoping to have one wish. To became one of Salter Street's next scriptwriter.",1056153600,,422,4.2875
7937366,5,B00005BGRP,"This Is A Great DVD  When I first viewed this series os Showtime, I have to admit, I thought it (wasn't good).  I wouldn't watch it at all.  It wasn't until friends convinced me to give it another try, that I found that I really did like the show.  I'm a big SciFi fan and this really is a great series.  Unfortunatly, it has now been canceled.  I am in the process of buying all the episodes.  This is one of the best.",1034812800,,419,3.9759036144578315
7937367,4,B00005BGRP,This is the second best DVD from season two.  It has the intro to the beautiful new Xev in Lyyka along with the introducion to Mantrid and a great comedic episode in love liner.  A great way to start off season two.,1025740800,2,215,4.095238095238095
7937368,5,B00005BGRP,"Episode ""Mantrid"" it's a verry imaginitive episode.
His Divine Shadow's tyranny has been overthrown, and His order left in ruins. Chaos reigns in the light universe, with His Shadow's minions scrambling to find a place for themselves. One of these is His Shadow's bio-vizier, Mantrid, who plans to become immortal by transferring his consciousness into a massive computer.
Episode 2.2 ""Terminal"" This is the 1st time xev dies.
Waking Kai can be a dangerous business, as Stanley Tweedle finds out the hard way. He is mortally wounded and, after some intense bargaining tactics on Zev's part, is rushed to the Medsat Medical Terminal. Here he is treated by the smarmy Doctor Kazzan who, to be fair, does indeed save his life. But along the way one ultimate sacrifice is made.
Episode 2.3 ""Lyekka""
The Lexx picks up an unusual passenger: a shape shifting plant who takes on the appearance of a girl from Stanley's dreams. At the same time, some intrepid space explorers from the planet Potatoho have a run in with the Lexx. Kai invites them aboard, and some awkward first contact scenarios are played out. It's revealed that these boys are patriotic to a fault; they'll do anything for the glory of Potatoho. Needless to say, they don't exactly jive with the rest of the crew.
Episode 2.4 ""Luvliner"" Every body on the LEXX better get ready for some bad Luck.
Let's face it, flying around the empty reaches of space without someone to play with makes for a frustrating time indeed. So when a signal is picked up from a nearby bordello satellite, its no wonder Stan and Xev are so eager to board. But the goods aren't exactly as advertised, and the den of iniquity turns out to be more of a pigpen. Still, Xev and Stan, accompanied by a reluctant 790, decide to indulge their desires.",1010275200,15,1779,4.723472668810289
7937369,5,B00005BGRP,Lexx is something either is understandable to you or is a b-grade sci-fi.  Those looking for stoic and run of the mill sci-fi tend to vilify Lexx as badly written and directed.  SciFi Channel's treatment of the series when it first aired alienated many people.  Now is the time to see them in order and uncut! Those who appreciate something a little different and understand pacing outside the realm of standard American TV get the quirkiness and love the sexual overtones.  Season 2 does suffer from a 'Movie of the Week' approach but those episodes seem more like homages than rip offs.  Volume 1 introduces the grand freak Mantrid and sets the arc for the entire season.  Watch and learn to Luv the Lexx.,1001289600,4,707,4.661290322580645
7937370,5,B00005BGRP,"Not many programs on television take risks like Lexx. TV programs just follow the same trustworthy formula, year after year. Lexx takes chances with every episode, and I admire that. You'll never see anything like this on regular primetime. Lexx pushes the envelope, and I hope they keep doing so for a long time.",999993600,4,313,4.814814814814815
7937371,5,B00005BGRP,"WEIRD AND FUNNY; THE BLACK HUMOR IS SUBTLE AND THE  SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE OUTSTANDING.  I GOT HOOKED ON IT WHEN THE ORIGINAL MULTT-PART MOVIE WERE SHOWN ON CABLE. I WATCHED THEM AS WELL AS  THE RERUN THAT WAS SHOWN MUCH LATER. NOW THE SERIES IS OUT AND IT IS EVEN MORE BIZARRE - IT REMINDS ME OF THE OLD HEAVY METAL MAGAZINES (I STOPPED MY SUBSCRIPSON WHEN IT WAS BOUGHT OUT BY NATIONAL LAMPOON.  TOO MUCH GORE AND FATALISTIC OVERTONES.)
THE 3RD SERIES LEANED IN THAT DIRECTION, TOO.  BUT, OVERALL I STILL LIKE THE PREMISE OF 1) STANLEY A DORK CONTROLLING A MEGA BIOSHIP CALLED LEXX, 2) KAI (THE GOOD GUY) A 2000 YEAR OLD ASSASSIN CONTROLLED BY 3) ""THE DIVINE SHADOW"" (AN IMMORTAL BAD GUY) AND 4) ZEV THE FAT KID ON THE BLOCK WHO WAS TURNED INTO A LOVE SLAVE WITH A LIBIDO TO MATCH (BODY AND ALL)BUT WITH A TOUCH OF CLUSTER LIZARD WHEN HER BRAIN WAS SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THE LOVE SLAVE ATTITUDE.  SHE DOES WHAT SHE WANTS, WHEN SHE WANTS, AND SHE'S GOT A THING FOR KAI.  OF COURSE THERE IS A A ROBOT HEAD ON WHEELS WHO GOT THE LOVE SLAVE INDOCTRINATION AND IS MADLY IN LOVE WITH ZEV. HOPELESS DEAD END THERE.
ALL SAID, YOU'LL EITHER LOVE OR HATE ""LEXX""; GIVE IT A FEW EPISODES BEFORE MAKING UP YOUR MIND - YOU MIGHT BE SURPRIZED!",994118400,6,1224,4.25
