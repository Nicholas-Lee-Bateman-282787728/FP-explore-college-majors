1407632,4,B000059PP2,"There are only four fantasy movies that I still get stoked on watching, Conan the Barbarian, Sword and the Sorcerer, Krull, and Dragon Slayer. Now, Sword and the Sorcerer comes home to DVD! I have been dreaming about seeing this movie again in widescreen and finally thanks to Anchor Bay I can rest in peace. This film has been one of my favorite childhood movies since I first saw it in the theaters and it has never looked better. Normally movies that I loved as a kid and watching them again now are pretty silly, but this movie stays pretty solid, even today.
The picture quality is great, the colors exibited look good with minor grain, mostly noticable in dark scenes but you can hardly tell. Black levels are right where they need to be. The 5.1 audio could have been better but it sounds solid. David Whittaker's music will blow you away (one of the best scores of all time).
On the extras side, well we are given two theatrical trailers and one t.v spot, and that's it, all I might add are pretty painful to watch. It would have been nice to have a special edition but i'm not complaining, I have a perfect widescreen DVD of one of my favorite movies. A big thumbs up goes to Anchor Bay, especially for not changing the cover art! Now if someone would only release Dragon Slayer on DVD!",988156800,4,1295,4.422594142259414

Richard Lynch and Richard Moll give great performances and Lee Horsley as the campy pre-Bruce Cambell meets Errol Flynn manly hero.  Excellent soundtrack  Awesome 3 bladed projectile broadsword!  A guilty childhood pleasure!  Thanks for putting this one on DVD Anchor Bay!",983750400,8,498,5.175

1407663,5,B000059PP2,"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for this flick.  Okay, it's as corny as they come and some of the stuff is truly ""over-the-top,"" but all in all I still love it.  I still find it puzzling, though, as to just how he maneuvers that three-bladed sword.  I'd think it would be a tad clumsy to wield, don't you?  Another point is where the Hell are the springs in the bloody thing?  I mean, how the Blazes does that contraption launch the blades the way it does?  And here I though Iowa produced corn.  Sorry, folks, but this flick outdoes you at your best!  Still in all, I still love it because it supplies me with a couple of good laughs and makes me wonder if the actors had to hide their faces as they cashed their paychecks.  All that said, it's still worth a bag of microwaved popcorn and a liter bottle of pop on a ""nothing to do"" afternoon.",1391558400,,851,4.140243902439025
1407664,5,B000059PP2,"My previous attempts to get a copy were pretty dismal--wrong region coding, would not play, in another language and would not change to English ----and Amazon was so cool to take them all back--and I kept looking 'cause Amazon somehow finds what you are looking for. And finally I got a region 1(USA copy) and it is a wonderful old cheesy movie that I loved and now can watch again whenever the feeling strikes me.
Yup, as everyone has said--this is an old cheesy ""swashandbuckle"" movie from the 80's (1982) that does not take itself seriously and is just fun(ny) to watch.  ""with what"" is just a running joke--!
this is one of those late night, can't sleep or rainy afternoon movie.
If you don't take it seriously, you will have a good time.
Update: 2/8/14--I finally sat down to watch the whole movie--only got part way through on the first 1/2 of this review--and horrors--the last 35 minutes of the DVD will not play. It freezes, sticks, jumps--and there is NO ENDING AT ALL-it just stops playing and starts over again. So once again, I am returning to Amazon. Just one, that is all I want, just one GOOD copy of this old movie that plays to the end without changing the language, bad region codes, stalling/freezing/stopping/jumping. Just one good copy. So disappointed.",1390867200,2,1275,4.691964285714286

1407667,1,B000059PP2,"I tried 3 separate players and none of them would play the DVD. Pretty bummed about it since I was so looking forward to seeing this movie again. I know, some reviews said it was ""cheezy"", well, yeah, that was sort of the point. It never takes its self too seriously and that was the goal I think. I had the VHS and finally wore it out, I don't mind a cheezy movie when it was meant to be cheezy. Anyone really think the Conan the Barbarian films with ""Ahnold"" were Oscar quality acting... they are meant to be fun and this movie scores a 10 in the fun department for me. As for the disk not working, I contacted the seller and am waiting to hear back, sure hope we can find a way to make it work. Will try to update this review when I hear back from the seller ""King-Shirt-Shop"" if I can figure out how to update a review :-)
UPDATE: 12 Jan 2014 - Kings Shirt Shop was true to their word and sent a new DVD to replace what we believed was an improperly coded DVD, the second DVD would not play either. Turns out, you have to have a DVD player capable of converting the PAL signal to NTSC. If this had been made clear in the item description, I most likely would not have purchased it. I take fully half the blame on this one, the other half goes to whoever wrote the item description for not making a point to highlight that the DVD signal needed to be ""converted"". PAL-NTSC is not something I have ever had to worry about and I own a LOT of DVD's. I have asked Kings Shirt Shop if they would consider refunding my money on this one. I'll update this again once I get an answer from them.",1388016000,,1589,4.079872204472843

1407678,4,B000059PP2,"I saw this film as a teenager back when the fantasy genre was just getting started. It was memorable back then. It has all of the classic elements. Some of the special effects are a little too intense for kids, but it is still pretty tame compared to what passes for fantasy today. It is a fun adventure film. I wish they had made a sequel.",1385424000,,340,4.166666666666667
1407679,3,B000059PP2,"Cheesy flick that's overpriced only because it's hard to find, no matter if it's amazon or ebay. Only worth the investment for those heavily into obscure and rare B-movies.

1407689,5,B000059PP2,"My friend and I are both huge Robert E. Howard fans, and needless to say we were pretty disappointed when we saw the first conan on the big screen after waiting years after hearing the rumors it was being made. I guess we were both happy that R.E.H.'s character hit the big screen at all, we both agreed that Arnold was a living special effect and the only one we knew of that came close to matching Conans stature. Other than that we were bummed out. This wasn't conan, some sad little blue eyed boy placidly excepting the beheading of his mother, some dim witted slave who,s physique was formed from forced slavery and was so ignorant he did,nt realize he was being paired off in a pit fight to the death until  he was being chewed up and spit out!!! NOT Robert E. Howards Conan at all! Then my friend brought over a VHS tape called ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" and said you gotta see this! Well I watched it and when it was done I turned to my friend and said holy crap that was conan, he just smiled and said I know. Other than Talons noble heritage his character is Robert E. Howards Conan the whole movie was a R.E.H. Conan adventure from the demonic wizard to the giant snake & horde of rats. Lee Horley even captured Conans wit "" thats a small threat, a very small threat.""Hilarious. The crucifixtion scene when Talon pushes through the pain and with brute force free's his self, pure R.E.H.Conan. The king says he thought Talon was off ruling some black tribe to the south...all Conan. The intro of Talon's different occupations strait out of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories even the violence was so R.E.H. skulls being split to the chin, sadistic jailers every thing about this movie was more Conan than ""Conan the barbarian"". If I dubbed over Talon's name with Conan and if Lee Horsley had given prince Mika the three bladed sword back to him along with the crown this would be the best Conan movie ever made! Some might say this movie didn't have a big enough budget and its B-rate don't let that detour you from getting this movie if you are a fan of sword & scorcery this is a must for your collection. If your a Robert E. Howard fan this movie is a must for your collection. Robert E. Howard wrote that Conan was known by many names he was called Amra when he was a pirate & chieftan of the black tribes to the south I think he was called Talon in the city of Adan & prince Mika was the kid fighting in the begining of this movie, Ha Ha Ha ...

1407692,4,B000059PP2,"Strong Sword and Sorcery elements which include a bold hero, a magic (or perhaps a genius of engineering, which could be the same thing) sword, beautiful women, an evil sorcerer and a cruel and merciless usurper. A great tone that shifts from lighthearted to serious and back at the right moments and a self aware script that doesn't ask too much of its actors but yet allows some personality to flow through. While the violence isn't (usually) gratuitous, Albert Pyun ensures their are the adequate gross-out moments (which is kind of a prerequisite for both S&S and 80's movies). Richard Lynch is great as the nasty King Cromwell (the Usurper), Lee Horsley is solid as Talon (aka Prince Talon who despite the descriptions only wants to avenge his father, not regain his kingdom) and George Maharis/Richard Moll trading off supremely as the evil sorcerer Xusia. Kathleen Beller is sexy, playful and strong as the love interest/damsel in distress and elevates that role beyond the stereotypical. Most of the supporting cast is solid and add a depth usually not seen in low budget films like this.

As much as I could bash some of the elements affected by the low production budget, the truth is, Albert Pyun and the actors did a great job of giving the viewer a great deal of exposition and details within the scope of the action. Because of this the movie is fast paced and this isn't a bad thing, it is at its core an action adventure film based in the Sword & Sorcery sub-genre and this films pace helps in that regard. While overall the film has a sexist angle of male's first(as the genre does)there are enough scenes that show women's strength and character as well, from Kathleen Beller and two other characters, elevating even that a bit.

Some films are good because they are bad and some are good despite themselves being bad, this film is the latter. Despite its flaws this film is action packed, does a better job at telling a Sword & Sorcery story in this medium then almost every other film (Sadly very view films stand out in this genre anyway) and fun. So many films I see as an adult (after having seen them as a young lad) I am sorely disappointed that they do not hold up, this film was not one of them! I enjoyed it even today.

Blades, boobs and the bombastic overacting of Richard Moll as the demonic sorcerer captivated my puberty-addled brain.  Now, it has lost much of its initial allure, but still manages to entertain based on the charisma of the two lead actors, and it's sense of tongue in cheek humor.

My only real complaint is that the print is quite grainy.  A restoration would have been nice, but given the perceived VERY small audience for this DVD purchase, I'm not surprised.

1407695,5,B000059PP2,"I saw parts of this on cable TV, never really thinking of it as too corny or silly.  It has humor but there is also a lot of sword fights, magic, beautiful woman, great actors and a good, solid story.  It was something you could watch again and again and always see something new and never get bored.
I think it is the humor that really stands out - the word play, the lift of an eyebrow, the one liners.  Also, on the DVD, you can see that many of the women are either topless and close to nude, which is always a plus for a male viewer.  The result is a low-budget film that does not act low-budget.  It has the epic feel, a story about good fighting evil fighting evil - hey, there is more than one bad guy which is a plus also.  There is a magical sword, a dungeon, and, yes, even a brothel.  Sailors, swords for hire, rebels fighting the good fight - everything you can think of.

It's basically a B-movie sword-and-sorcery flick, but aside from some trite dialogue and the fact that the demon raised in the movie was played by Richard Moll (a good actor, but after seeing him play Bull on ""Night Court"" kind of took the scare away), the movie has held up well.

Cult movie from the 80s maybe?  Sci-fi?  Yup.  Same guy as this Conan ripoff?  Yup.  And over 40 other films in less than 30 years.  The man has certainly been prolific - if not particularly good.

Well, he started off on the right foot, even if this low-budget affair is cheesy, goofy, and most definitely made to cash in on the Schwarzenegger film's success; or presumptive success might be a better way to put it, as it was actually released a few weeks before John Milius' bigger-budgeted, better-marketed film. In fact (and this blew my mind) it had almost exactly the same box office gross, at least in the USA, as the film that made Arnie a star - 40 million dollars or so, a substantial amount for a low-budget indie in those days.

Why the film hasn't stayed in the public consciousness and why the promised sequel (mentioned in the end credits crawl) had to wait until this year, remains a mystery to me after re-watching the film recently. The plot is pretty basic and really rather inconsequential: evil Cromwell takes over the peaceful kingdom of Ehdan with the help of monstrous undead sorcerer Xusia, killing the king and his family but missing young Talon, he of the three-bladed sword, who will eventually grow into strapping he-man Lee Horsley and come back for revenge, along the way saving gorgeous Princess Alana (Kathleen Beller) and her brother Micah, who believes himself to be the rightful heir in the absence of Talon. There's lots of fairly mediocre and unconvincing swordplay, plenty of shots of the half-naked Horsley for the ladies and the scantily-clad Beller and other nubile vixens for the guys, rather dreamy overlit photography that helps camouflage the overall cheapness of the sets and costumes, and a musical score that's rousing if rather shameless in its ripping off of 40s swashbuckler stuff and even for a moment ""Gone With the Wind"".

But what makes the film work is the sense of humor it has about itself, and Horsley's charisma. How can anybody take the triple-sword (which fires two of its blades like crossbow bolts) seriously, or do anything but laugh when Talon is crucified on a big wooden X at a wedding celebration but pulls the spikes out of his hands (mostly in slow-mo of course) and then goes on to start chopping up the bad guys as if nothing happened? The film has an energy and verve that for me more than makes up for some really ludicrous lapses in plotting near the end, and I for one wish that a sequel starring Horsley had been made. This is Pyun's highest-rated film on the IMDb and judging from what else I've seen and the descriptions and comments on a few others, probably deserves to be. Too bad - it's far from a great film, but it's sad that the director has become such a joke ever since.",1254960000,2,2928,4.633204633204633

1407702,4,B000059PP2,"Usually when you see that a film is directed by Albert Pyun, it's best to just run away and not look back.  Pyun has directed tons of dreadful films over the years(this is the man responsible for the Steven Seagal film, Ticker as well as the Snoop Dogg/Fat Joe/Ice-T/Big Pun horror themed crapfest, Urban Menace).  His home for the last two decades has been the direct to video market, and most likely you have seen one of his films at some time(and probably shut it off after twenty minutes).  His biggest deal was Cyborg, which many have seen.  Once in awhile the stars seem to be in line coz Pyun will manage to crank out something entertaining.  Yes, I liked Mean Guns and the quirky Full Moon pic, Dollman.
The Sword and the Sorcerer is without a doubt his finest movie.  It was also his first film and is different from anything else he's done.  Made during the sword and sorcery resurgence of the early 80s, this film is a nice addition right up there with Conan and the Beastmaster.  Though it's budget is considerably lower than those films, it's a step above Deathstalker.  Plot wise, it's rather standard for the genre.  Lee Horsley is a wandering warrior who comes across a city ruled by evil usurper, Cromwell.  He's ""hired""(he does it for sex with the leading lady as opposed to money) to rescue the rightful heir from Cromwell's dungeon and restore peace, happiness, ta-la, tra-la.  A demon-like sorcerer played by Richard Moll has helped Cromwell in his conquests, but was betrayed and left for dead, and now plotting his own revenge.  Horsley uses a three bladed sword that looks terribly awkward as a weapon.  It can also shoot it's blades like a harpoon gun(but with a vapor trail and cool sound effect).
It's a pulpy and very fun movie.  Why it's no longer available for a decent price on DVD is a mystery and a damn shame(I was lucky enough to get it years ago when it was still in print).  It's dark, it's gritty, it's also a bit tongue in cheek.  Horsley  is an adequate hero.  He's not the beefcake Arnold or Marc Singer were, but he has charisma.  Richard Moll isn't seen much, but he's a cool character.  The scene where he's first conjured is kinda creepy(well, it scared me when I was a kid anyway).  The evil Cromwell is played by Richard Lynch, who any cult horror/action film buff knows is an iconic bad guy.  From Ruggero Deodato's Cut and Run to the Chuck Norris extravaganza, Invasion U.S.A., Lynch is the man to turn to when you want a bad guy that really looks like a bad guy.  The man doesn't even have to act, he just has to be in the frame.
All in all, a very enjoyable movie if you like this genre.  Probably the best you're gonna do once you leave the big budget area.  It's one of those films where at the end, before the credits, a message pops up on screen to tell us that ""Talon"" will soon be returning in another adventure.

1407714,2,B000059PP2,"Fantasy movies from the early 1980s, with few exceptions, varied mostly from run of the mill mediocre to painfully bad.  Albert Pyun's THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, a bargain-basement budgeted, uninspired, and messy bloodfest from 1982, falls among the lowest end of the spectrum.  Clocking in at a seemingly neverending 100 minutes, it starts out when medieval tyrant King Cromwell (Richard Lynch), on a quest for world domination, resurrects a centuries-old sorcerer, Xusia (Richard Moll, in heavy lizardlike makeup) to conquer the tranquil kingdom of Eh-Dan.  Ten years later, Talon (Lee Horseley), a prince who escaped the invasion, leads a band of mercenaries to liberate conquered kingdoms.  In the process, he returns to his old home of Eh-Dan, where rightful heir Mikah (Simon MacCordinkale) and his voluptuous sister Alana (Kathleen Beller), are plotting to overthrow Cromwell, who, incidentally, has plans to marry the lass.  When Mikah is kidnapped, Alana desperately hires Talon to rescue him; he agrees to do so on the condition that they have a lovemaking session should he succeed.  Oh, and incidentally, Xusia (who had been betrayed by Cromwell) is also planning to settle the score with his former ally, spending about a good portion of the last third disguised as a shady court advisor, Mahelli (George Maharis).  (This last plot development is handled clumsily and in a groanworthy way, as is much of the movie.)

Taken as a plot concept, THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER sounds fairly uninspired, but it's even worse in its execution.  The simplistic plot becomes needlessly convoluted as it bounces all over the place, throwing in lots of unexplained and abrupt developments that come from nowhere--if Cromwell needed Xusia to conquer Eh-Dan, then why does he stab and then throw him over a cliff shortly after smashing a few armies?  There are lots of unexplained stupidities, too, particularly in the hero's weapon, which, at the touch of a button, can send one of its *three* blades spearing through an enemy like a projectile; furthermore, at the laughably choreographed final showdown between the villain and the hero, we discover that the sword can opt as an alternate dagger in the event that it is shattered in close combat.  That is only one of the many scripting problems contained in this movie.

It's poorly edited, too, particularly the hero's first combat scene with two villains.  All the shots in that moment are spliced completely out of order, making it a very choppy and confusing flow.  Another particular example of bad editing occurs when a group of rebels makes plans to invade Cromwell's castle, and the next shot shows them all in prison!  This is done with no transition or explanation, that it makes it mystifying how they got there.

What ultimately works against THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER overall, however, is the excess of gory violence (one person's face is sliced in half with bloody results, another's heart is ripped out of her chest, and a tongue is cut out) and occasional nudity (the hero swings into a room with topless babes, and in another scene the leading lady is given an oil bath).  These two controversial elements can be put to effective use in masterpieces like PAN'S LABYRINTH (lots of horrifying violence, but done in a meaningful way) or, perhaps in CONAN THE BARBARIAN (par for the course with the original pulp novels it was based on).  Here, however, both are slapped onto this film for no other apparent reason than just violence and nudity for the mere sake of it.  In one particularly distasteful sequence, we see the hero spiked onto a cross, bleeding painfully during the main villain's wedding.  Not only did I find this a blasphemous and tasteless echo of Christ's crucifixion, I found it even more ridiculous (and sickening) that Talon would have the gall to yank himself free of the device.

Even without these problems, there's hardly anything to recommend about THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER.  The characterizations are mono-dimensional and uninteresting, the acting and the dialogue are terrible (Moll does get some points for being at least scary, even though he has little to do in his surprisingly scanty role, as does MacCordinkale, who does a decent job), and the direction is very amateurish and clumsy.  The special effects are also pretty cheesy, particularly the aforementioned sword and especially in a corny transformation scene toward the end of the film where a character literally pulls apart his human skin to reveal a demonic creature. The only thing to come clean out of this dreck is a lively musical score by David Whittaker as well as Moll and MacCordinkale's performances, but otherwise, the movie as a whole is little more than standard junk for undemanding fans of this kind of trashy fantasy.

When it's all over, just before the credits roll, there is a comment made that the hero will have further adventures in an upcoming film called ""Tales of the Ancient Empire.""  Successful as THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER was financially, it's not really all that surprising that audiences were never treated(?) to such a sequel.

Cromwell is great as is Xusia and Rodrigo and all the rest.  A lot of these actors went on to successful TV roles in Murphy Brown, Night Court and of course Horsley in Matt Houston.  Look through the credits to see.

Anyway....

How many movies do you remember seeing back in a different lifetime that you thought were really cool only to check 'em out in the current day and find that they really were average at best? The Sword and the Sorcerer is definitely one of those movies. 25 years is a long time, and my viewing of this film back in 1982 at age 20 was...let's just say...""enhanced"" by...well...the things I used to do prior to plopping myself in front of cable TV at 2 a.m.

But The Sword and the Sorcerer is still fun. The audio magicians did a little sorcery of their own and gave Sword a surround sound update back in 2001, but the DVD picture is still as grainy as a VCR would be.

The story is cool. A fictional Days of King Arthur-ish tale of Tyrant Titus Cromwell's rise to power, and, Son of King Richard, Prince Talon's fight to take back the throne that would have been his. Throw in evil Sorcerer Xusia (also vying for the Crown), have him conjure up a ton of camp and a lack of continuity, and you have what-seemed-a-lot-better-at-the-time The Sword and the Sorcerer.

The Sword and the Sorcerer was Albert Pyun's directorial debut (and it shows). But the movie's $40MM box office take surprised even the producers that had originally planned a sequel called Tales of the Ancient Empire that continued the adventure of Prince Talon. Pyun said that Sword was so profitable that ironically a decision was made to scrap the sequel and just bank the profits of the original. Smart move.

Pyun went on to direct a score of B movies and clunkers. The little known lead actors all went on to lead pretty successful TV careers. No sequel was ever made. We all lived happily ever after.",1170028800,2,2310,4.660933660933661

Also appearing is Simon MacCorkindale (Death on the Nile, Jaws 3-D), George Maharis (The Satan Bug), and Richard Moll (The Dungeonmaster, House), probably best know as the tall, bald headed bailiff Bull from the popular television series ""Night Court"".

As the film begins we learn through narration and visuals that a tyrant usurper named Titus Cromwell (Lynch) desperately wants overthrow a peaceful and wealthy neighboring kingdom, so much so he resurrects a demonic, reptilian faced wizard named Xusia (Moll) to aid him in his efforts.  Xusia's main power seems to be the ability to yank out other peoples internal organs through mental telepathy, which is pretty nasty, but I'm unsure how it would assist in overthrowing a kingdom, but whatever...apparently Cromwell realizes this, too, as he quickly betrays Xusia with a sword to the guts, but the wily wizard manages to escape.  Anyway, Cromwell does succeed in his bid to take the kingdom, killing off nearly the entire royal family except for Prince Talon, who gets away with a three bladed sword (two of the blades can be fired like projectile weapons) entrusted to him by his father.  As the years pass Talon grows into a man (who looks a lot like Lee Horsley), and Cromwell becomes a powerful ruler with an eye towards ruling the entire civilized world (he wants all the cheese).  In one particular kingdom a rebellion forms against Cromwell, lead by a prince named Mikah (MacCorkindale), assisted by his sister Princess Alana (Beller), who's got a real bad habit of kneeing guys in their nether regions...actually, it's a pretty poor rebellion as rebellions go, as it seems made up of only a handful of greasy farmers...anyway, there's a bit of betrayal resulting the Mikah being captured, forcing Alana to enlist the aid of Talon, agreeing to partake in a night of whoopee with Talon if he saves her brother (having seen Ms. Beller in all her nekkid glory in the 1978 film The Betsy, I'd have to say it's worth it).  A whole bunch of stuff happens, most of which I won't go into, but Xusia eventually returns, Talon gets crucified, and Cromwell tries to hook up with Alana, all leading up to a climatic battle between the forces of good and evil, the fate of the world hanging in the balance...

The fantasy action/adventure genre really busted loose in the early to mid 1980s with the release of the good...Conan the Barbarian (1982), Dragonslayer (1981), Krull (1983), The Beastmaster (1982), Legend (1985), and the not so good...Lucio Fulci's Conquest (1983), and Hawk the Slayer (1980), to name a couple...where does The Sword and the Sorcerer fall?  For me, somewhere in the middle.  It's not a completely bad movie, but it does have an abundance of flaws, the main ones including a fairly convoluted plot, not so hot production values, goofy acting (a pretty common fault in many sword and sorcery pictures of the time), and some fairly funky, eye rolling dialog (pay particular attention to the bit between Talon and the princess, talking about his `sword').  As far as the plot, it is messy and confusing, but I have to give the filmmakers credit for their ambition as they did try to cram more in here than is usually found within films of the genre, but it got a little out of hand as things progressed.  One thing that really annoyed me early on was the narration...for about the first twenty minutes or so, the narrator chimes in on a regular basis, spewing forth unnecessary exposition.  Horsley actually came off alright, except for the fact he appeared to be wearing a dead wombat on his head the entire time.  I think it was meant to be a wild, untamed coif, but it reminded me of the ridiculous perm my older brother got himself in the late 1970s.  Lynch does well enough, but it's pretty much a role I've seen him in any number of times before.  His character did seem a bit too `hands on', always insinuating himself into things I wouldn't think he'd normally be involved in, you know, given the fact he's running an entire kingdom and such, but given the general ineptitude of his minions, I suppose he had little choice (on the flipside, Talon's men certainly weren't of the rocket scientist variety either).  I did learn much from this film, including the following...

1. Moldy, powerful, reptilian mages recently resurrected from the dead are extremely cranky and likely to yank someone's guts out.

2. Usurping tyrants are often fickle, and will turn on their underlings in a heartbeat, even moldy, powerful, reptilian mages resurrected from the dead intended to help them accomplish a goal not yet completed.

3. If you do revive a moldy, powerful, reptilian mage from the dead and plan on betraying him, best to kill him dead as they tend to hold a grudge.

4. When your soon to be dead father makes you swear to avenge his death, it's okay to take an extensive amount of time off for yourself to wander the globe, have grand adventures, and score with babes before actually getting down to business.

5. Princesses tend to go for the gonasticales when threatened and will use access to their goodies to barter for necessary services.

6. Princes are laughably gullible.

7. A prince, a princess, and eight, greasy, spindly armed farmers do not a rebellion make.

8. If you're sneaking into a castle via the sewers and one of your party, especially an inconsequential member (an elderly man, perhaps), falls behind, best to leave him rather than try and assist him and get eaten by ravenous rats.

9. Best to kill the architect of your castle, rather than imprisoning him in the dungeon in an effort to protect information regarding secret passageways and such, eliminating the opportunity for some swarthy hero-type from rescuing him and using said information against you.

10. Interior doors within castles are made of balsa wood.

11. A crucified man makes an interesting set piece for a wedding.

12. If you have enough intestinal fortitude, you can free yourself after being crucified.

13. A three bladed sword, one that launches two of the blades as projectiles, seems an impractical and unwieldy weapon (where does one get replacement blades?).

14. Gold lamay armor festooned with sequins may look pretty, but does little in protecting ones vitals.

15. The days of yore were full of smoke, mist, fog, vapors, steam, smog, and anything else that could just generally keep one from clearly seeing what's going on.

Just a note...on the surface this might appear a film suitable for general audiences, but there is a good amount of violence, blood and even some nekkidness once things get going, so it might not be one for younger viewers.

The picture on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 televisions, looks all right I suppose, but some of the scenes are kind of murky and muddled.  The audio, available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0, comes through very well.  As far as extras, there are two theatrical trailers, a television spot, and a 5X7 insert reproduction of original poster art, with the chapter stops on the flipside.

1407721,2,B000059PP2,"'The Sword and the Sorcerer' released in '82 is a mixed bag of positive and negative.

The Negative: The production values are marginal, the picture quality overall dark and grainy. The dialogue doesn't fair any better, it's also dull and uninspired. As for the storyline, well I found it extremely uneven with some parts of the movie excruciatingly slow and others quite good.

The Positive: Lee Horsley is surprisingly engaging as the vagabound, warrior Prince Talon and Kathleen Beller is breathtaking as Princess Alana, she's never looked better. The film is worth at least one watch just to see Kathleen in her prime. There are also numerous other very lovely ladies (such as Anna Bjorn) in this production that will keep all the young male viewers interest peaked.

Cast includes; Richard Moll, George Maharis, Richard Lynch, Simon McCorkindale and Robert Tessier, one of the great tough guys in film.",1152662400,3,907,5.073825503355705
1407742,4,B000059PP2,"Wow. The Sword & the Sorcerer, on DVD. A blast from my past that I can't pass up. Bear with me while I reminisce briefly - I'll come around to the point in a moment.

Once upon a time, long, long ago, I found a book. Just a couple hundred pages long, but chock-full of bloody adventure. The cover is what grabbed my attention, really: a vicious looking ape-thing, partially covered with a tattered crimson cape, and a lean, scarred, snarling blue-eyed barbarian, armed with nothing but a short blade, clinging to the monster's back. I begged my mom to buy it for me. After several head-shakes and skeptical looks regarding my fascination with the silly thing, she gave in. And thus it was my first exposure to Robert E. Howard and Frank Frazetta, an event that probably warped me beyond belief. I spent the next few years tracking down everything Howard ever wrote, every Conan story ever published, and just about every other conceivable sword & sorcery and dark fantasy story/compilation/novel I could lay my hands on, with authors ranging from the swashbuckling classics (Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories) to the dark, creepy and, well, Wagner-esk (Karl Edward Wagner, and his sorcerer/warrior/killer, Kane).

Spiral down the road bit - I'm a little older, haphazardly dealing with my freshman year of high school, and suddenly Howard's stories came to life with a Muscle & Fitness magazine article featuring pre-Gubornator Ah-nold and the film version of Conan the Barbarian. Being rebels, albeit too young to go see an R-rated movie by ourselves, some friends and I promptly decided to sneak into a local theater on opening day and watch Ah-nold mangle the English language on celluloid. We stayed and watched him defeat Thulsa Doom and toss James Earl Jones' severed head down those steep marble steps five times in a row.

Right afterwards, I ran to the store and bought the movie novelization. Read that. Re-read all my Conan comic books, too.

And so it went - my obsession with sword & sorcery books suddenly transmorgified into a new obsession with, ta-dah! Movies! And thank God, because right about that time She decided to invent the VCR (err, yeah, I know, Betamax came first. Whatever). My dad splurged and bought a big, clunky top-loading VCR that cost something like four hundred bucks (but hey - now he could tape golf while he watched football) and had a 'remote' with a four-foot cord that was attached directly to the unit (Ah, the golden days. But you know what? That thing was a freakin' tank - it lasted FOREVER and would play ANYTHING, no matter how messed up the tape was).

So I spent the next four years watching every cheesy sci-fi/fantasy flick that our local, pre-Blockbuster/mega-video store managed to pull in to stock. From the Good (Conan, Excalibur) to the crummy (Conan the Destroyer, the Barbarians), to... this. The Sword & the Sorcerer.

Low budget. Yes. But so much better for it. This baby is right out of the gritty, blood-caked, Weird Tales style of dark fantasy, with the swashbuckling warrior (Lee Horsely, who's career pretty much ended right here), on a bloodthirsty quest to rescue the sultry, beautiful princess (Kathleen Beller) from the vile, wicked sorcerer (Richard Moll), in the process winning back his stolen kingdom, torn away by a bloodthirsty tyrant (Richard Lynch). Sci-fi/action hack supreme Albert Pyun (see Nemesis - one the cooler Blade Runner/Terminator/Cyborg style knock-offs) directs with an unusual flair for something this on-the-cheap, making Sword & The Sorcerer a cheesy treat to remember.

By the way - yeah, I bought the novelization for this one, too. And I still have it, safely tucked away with all my old Conan books. Even though I just ordered Sword & Sorcerer on DVD, I dunno if I can wait. Think I'll go pull the book out now, then jump into bed with a flashlight, pull the covers over my head, and read until the sun creeps up.

Maybe I'm not so grown up yet after all.",1150761600,6,3971,4.829411764705882

1407745,4,B000059PP2,"Borrowing heavily from the writings of Robert E. Howard (the opening scene was nearly plagiarized from Chapter One of ""The Hour of the Dragon""), ""The Sword and the Sorceror"" is quite an enjoyable film, if you're into that sort of thing.  If you hate S&S films, however, this is probably just going to reinforce that opinion, don't waste your time if you're NOT into it.

While I'm not going to go into too much detail reviewing this, I would like to point out that Lee Horsely's portrayal of Talon is actually more like the literary Conan than Arnold's interpretation of the same character in ""Conan the Barbarian"".

Yes, its cheesy.  Yes, its unbelievable.  Yes, some of the acting is downright laughable.  But it really doesn't matter, does it?  This movie is still far better than ""Conan the Destroyer"", ""Red Sonja"", or any of the ""Beastmaster"" films.  So sit back and enjoy.  This movie rocks!",1123804800,4,897,4.7727272727272725
1407746,4,B000059PP2,"There were loads of Swords & Sorcery films coming out in the 80's, most of them low budget garbage.  But this was actually one of the better films.  It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable.  Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant.  Pretty standard stuff.  But it's exectuted well.  The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard's Conan Story ""The Hour of the Dragon"" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer.  In the Conan story the sorcerer's name was Zaltotun.  In this movie, the name is Xusia.  Mere coincidence?  I think not.  But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame).  He's suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life.  Unfortunately Xusia doesn't get enough screen time.

Lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here, too.  Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan.  He's a fun-loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne.  He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross, although it's an ""X"" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism.  Again, this is a scene lifted from a Conan story ""A Witch Shall be Born"" when Conan was nailed to a cross.  Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon, actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately.  Now, I'm no doctor but I'm guessing that someone who had a 4"" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but, ok, it's fantasy so I'll buy it.

Still, despite some shortcomings, this is an enjoyable little diversion.  The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized.",1119571200,2,1999,4.5251396648044695
1407747,5,B000059PP2,"This outrageous, gratuitous, exploitative, low-budget fantasy epic has to be one of the most entertainingly misguided movies ever. The whole thing is played with the rousing, happy enthusiasm of a children's adventure film, but it's loaded with blood and gore, off-color humor, nudity, and sex. It also seems to have been inspired by everything from ""Excalibur"" to ""Conan the Barbarian"" to ""Star Wars"" to various gory late-70's and early 80's horror movies.
Lee Horsely plays Talon, a rogue barbarian who travels around a fairy tale kingdom on his horse, looking for adventure. He dresses like Conan, smirks and wisecracks like Han Solo, and looks just like every wanna-be actor in Hollywood in the early 1980's - with chin stubble, and a big, feathered, blow-dry hairdo. And oh yeah, he also has a trademark weapon (every great '80's action hero had to have a trademark weapon) - a magical sword with three blades. The extra blades can shoot off and look very awkward as they fly through the air and impale bad guys. How the blades get replaced is never explained, but somehow they always do.
Richard Moll plays Xusia the Sorcerer, who looks like a cross between Freddy Krueger from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and The Emperor from ""Return of the Jedi"". He sleeps in a coffin covered with human faces and filled with blood. The real bad guy of the movie is Cromwell, a ruthless leader from another country who is trying to conquer the entire land. He seeks out Xusia and demands that the ancient Sorcerer use his evil powers to help him. Xusia rips out the heart of a half-naked witch girl and agrees to help.
Cromwell pillages and plunders and takes hostage the leader of the resistance, Micah, and tortures him in the dungeon. So Micah's sexy brunette sister (played by Kathleen Bellar) seeks out Talon and begs him to help her rescue Micah. Talon (our hero) is at his sleaziest here, as he tells Bellar that his fee for the rescue mission is that he gets to have sex with her. Thus the adventure begins!
The good guys sneak into Cromwell's castle. Talon steals the guard's uniform and gets into lots of fight scenes. Bad guys get shot with arrows, set on fire, stabbed, etc. Another bad guy gets his head splattered on a grinding stone. Kathleen Bellar gets captured by the bad guys and thrown into Cromwell's harem. Once she's stark naked and receiving a full body massage from the other harem girls, she doesn't seem to mind so much anymore. Talon gets caught by the bad guys and crucified with his hands nailed to a big, wooden X. No problem. He just yanks his hands off the spikes that have been driven through them, and goes back to fighting!
The big ending takes place in a scary, cave-like dungeon with smoke and blue lighting. One of Cromwell's servants takes the sexy heroine (now barely dressed in a skimpy white costume and pearls) down to this dungeon and acts like he's going to rescue her. But then, in a very gruesome special effects sequence, he rips his own face in half and reveals that he's really Xusia, the Sorcerer in a flesh and blood disguise! The girl faints and falls to the ground, where she is attacked by a snake. There are many slow, lingering shots of Kathleen Bellar's bare legs writhing with the snake twisting around them. Cromwell and Talon show up and the ending is a big, three-way fight between Talon, Cromwell, and Xusia. The Sorcerer tries to use his evil powers to rip Talon's heart out. The magic sword shoots more blades. Cromwell's staff has a secret blade hidden inside of it! Talon breaks the magic sword in half to reveal that it ALSO has a secret weapon hidden inside! Cool! Then Cromwell reveals ANOTHER hidden weapon! Then Talon unleashes a hidden knife blade from his wristband!!!! AWESOME!!!!! There is more violence, and Talon wins. He chops the snake's head off and saves the girl. Then we see him swinging on a rope carrying the girl, as several people down on the ground pump their fists and shout his name! ""TA-LON! TA-LON!""
But the funniest part is the very last thing, right before the credits: A title card comes up, promising that ""Talon WILL return!"" A goofy title for a sequel is offered. But alas, no such sequel was ever made. Oh well.",1105401600,4,4204,4.659488559892329
1407748,3,B000059PP2,"In the ancient days of the early '80s, many Conan-imitation fantasies stalked the land. Most of them were cheap, dreary, and unwatchable. But the best of this low-budget bunch was the successful 1982 flick, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."" Director Albert Pyun has gone onto to direct a slew of very cheesy movies, often featuring kickboxing, but this is his best film. People who love brawny sword-swingin' action will get a kick out of it. Yes, it's done cheaply, but there's some honest imagination in it, and the plot -- although filled with massive holes as deep as torture pits -- actually seems as if the writers took some time to think it up. The story still follows the basic clichs of this type of fantasy -- saving princesses, a vengeance-seeking hero, a resurrected evil wizard -- but it flows well and keeps you interested.

Of course,the film has tons of problems, and anyone who isn't seriously into the fantasy genre or early 80s movies will probably hate it. The sets are inexpensive and unimpressive, the photography cramps the action to stretch the budget, visual effects are minimal, and the acting is at best only adequate (but still better than most films of this kind). Lee Horsley plays the wise-cracking hero Talon, who wields a silly but rather cool three-bladed sword. Talon joins the resistance against evil King Cromwell (veteran b-movie villain Richard Lynch) in order to rescue a princess (Kathleen Beller). Behind it all lurks a monstrous sorcerer (Richard Moll under some well-done make-up) who has it in for Cromwell for betraying him and manipulates the resistance for his own ends. The story builds up to a surprisingly exciting finale that flexes some furious muscle and spills copious amounts of blood.

Unlike fantasy movies made today, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is adult in tone: the violence gets quite bloody and extreme, and casual nudity is sprinkled throughout. The DVD from Anchor Bay is an adequate presentation. The picture is letterboxed and enhanced for widescreen TVs. There is some grain, but the well-lit scenes look quite clear. The sound comes in 2.0 surround and 5.1. The 5.1 mostly expands the music to the back speakers, but it sound good considering the age and budget of the film. The only extras are two trailers (almost exactly the same) and a TV spot. As usual with Anchor Bay, there are no subtitles whatsoever, not even in English.

For night with people who love sword-slashing fun and don't mind some silly budget-cutting, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is a good bet.",1102982400,48,2533,4.8997668997669

1407763,3,B000059PP2,"I love this film!! I saw this, at the ripe old age of 31, way back in 1982, when the sword and sorcery genre was just getting started....in fact, with this movie and ""Conan The Barbarian"". ""Conan"" struck me as being ridiculous, especially with Arnold wearing a phylactery on his head with his forehead showing, unlike every illustrated image I had ever seen of Robert E. Howard's hero. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom was BEYOND ridiculous with that pathetic longhaired wig that just didn't jibe with his features.

Now, ""Sword & the Sorcerer"" didn't have the bucks behind it that ""Conan"" did, however, it is MUCH truer to the spirit of both the novels and Marvel comics stories that I remember reading when I was in college. Though the acting in some spots is laughable, this movie has a definite ""matinee"" quality that makes you root, if only internally, for the hero and his friends.

I only just recently realized that Lee Horsley played Talon, the hero, because he doesn't even remotely resemble Matt Houston or his ""Paradise"" character in the role. Other TV people pepper the cast with their presence, but the weirdest cast member HAS to be Joe Regalbuto  as one of Talon's freebooting colleagues. Hard to imagine Frank Fontana playing a pirate, isn't it? Richard Lynch, a man who has made a career out of playing truly despicable characters, plays Titus Cromwell, a usurper king who has to be patterned after Hollywood's generic image of Alexander the Great. He OOZES evil in the role, relishing every snarl and hiss he speaks. Kathleen Beller, who has to have the prettiest brown eyes and long lashes in TV, plays the hero-girl and love interest Alana.

While the art direction is actually pretty good for the time it was made, and holds up over time, and the cinematography is almost exemplary, the TRULY hammy acting is what gives this movie its funky, campy charm! Richard Lynch assays a line in the movie that will go down in cinema history as one of the classics of the ""Yonduh lies da cassul of my fodduh"" school, when he tells George Maharis' Count Machelli that he must ""Obey"" his ""orduhs"". Maharis follows a few scenes later with an equally comically read line ""...He must be one of SHOOSIA'S demons!"". (That's actually spelled ""Xusia"", but Maharis' too-American reading of it lengthens the ""u"" sound in the word and puts an ""sh"" where a ""z' sound should be in the beginning of the name.)

ALL the characters are portrayed rather broadly, with some of the corniest double-entendrs and dialogue you're likely to ever see in a movie made after 1939! Like I said, this is the charm of the movie....it's actually very witty in parts, and one character, Captain Morgan, the only black with a speaking part in the flick, utters some of the funniest diction you'll ever hear as he says ""Blast you, Eric! Spread the word of Talon's plight!"" in tones so clipped, you'll swear he just learned English. Phonetically!

Talon, it turns out, is the long lost son of the king Cromwell slayed when Talon was a young prince to obtain his peaceful kingdom, and to compensate for this loss, he has turned into a soldier of fortune, helping other kings retain or regain their kingdoms for a price. Alana, the daughter of one of his father's advisors, pleads her case with him, not knowing who he is, to rid his native Ehdan of the usurper Cromwell, so her brother, Prince Mikah, can sit on the throne as the ""rightful heir"". This Talon does, never revealing to anybody else but Cromwell who he really is. Along the way, there are various cartoon gorey scenes that a two year old could tell were fake, (though they're STILL pretty gruesome,)some actually pretty good music, very colorful frames, and some of the most comically corny dalogue and acting you'll ever see in a movie. It's easy to believe that the people involved INTENDED to make this movie so campy, because it's pretty consistent throughout.

This movie can be had dirt cheap, NEW, on VHS, so I recommend you get it, pop open a brewsky with your GF or buddies and enjoy one funny, well-filmed camp classic.",1074297600,5,4065,4.708860759493671
1407764,4,B000059PP2,"This is one of the best, and surprisingly underestimated, fantasy movies of the 80's. It goes along the lines of classics like Beastmaster, Conan, Dragonslayer, Krull and Legend. Its best features are the great dialogues and solidly written characters, the marvelous sets, a surprisingly coherent and original plot, and an excellent soundtrack. The acting on the movie is not so good, but the story is so entertaining and funny that you won't really mind.
Talon, the son of a murdered King, turns into a barbarian hero who tries to end the rule of an evil conqueror and his allied demon. To achieve his goal he must free the heirs of the kingdom and avenge his father. In his quest he will encounter all the elements common in most fantasy stories: sword battles, powerful demons and treacherous villains, beautiful and exotic damsels in distress and dark ancient rituals and magic spells.
After the credits roll by, you will probably be left expecting to see the second installment of this movie: Tales of the Ancient Empire, which unfortunately, was never made.
A word of warning: the image quality of the DVD is not great, nor does this movie have any Special Features, but it's very unlikely it will ever get a better edition.

1407766,4,B000059PP2,"One must practice special caution when indulging in an Albert Pyun film. B movie fans know all too well the dangers associated with this director, his cavalier ways of spurning decent plots, workable scripts, an emphasis on acting as a centerpiece to filmmaking, and special effects. Yep, Pyun really knows how to take the fun out of movies. That hasn't stopped the guy from producing clunkers into the present day. Pyun is responsible for the ""Nemesis"" series, ""Cyborg,"" ""Brain Smasher: A Love Story,"" and ""Omega Doom."" At least this director utilizes master thespians like Christopher Lambert and Jean Claude Van Damme in his films. Regrettably, there is no other way to state it: Albert Pyun is a hack. At least Al didn't completely embarrass himself when he made ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" in 1982. I say ""completely"" because there is still plenty of eye rolling dialogue and groan inducing situations in this sword and sandal epic, but overall this movie actually manages to entertain.

The early 1980s saw the emergence of a slew of barbarian genre films flood the market, due largely to the success of Schwarzenegger's ""Conan the Barbarian."" ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is probably one of the better ones to roll down the pike. It's definitely better than ""Red Sonja,"" or Miles O'Keefe's ""Ator."" Even better is the television talent that populates ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."" In the starring role of Talon is none other than ""Matt Houston"" star Lee Horsley. Simon MacCorkindale, who worked on ""Falcon Crest,"" plays rebel leader Prince Mikah. Then there is Kathleen Beller who did a stint on ""Dynasty,"" seen here as Princess Alana. Throw in Richard Moll (""Night Court"") as the evil and ugly sorcerer Xusia along with B movie favorite Reb Brown and Joe Regalbuto (Frank Fontana from ""Murphy Brown""), and you have a cast packed with familiar faces. You can almost track the course of 1980s pop culture by watching this film.

The plotline here isn't all that different from your typical barbarian movie. Evil King Titus Cromwell, played with smoldering intensity by Richard Lynch, resurrects the wizard Xusia in order to use his magic to conquer the kingdom in which Talon is a potential heir. Cromwell always deals off the bottom of the deck in his foreign relations, first double crossing Xusia and then rampaging through Talon's kingdom, killing his father, his mother, and spiriting off any potential heirs he finds. Talon escapes with his father's special sword, a rather pathetic looking thing with three blades, two of which can shoot through the air with cheesy accuracy. This background section of the film offers the viewer some narration by a guy my girlfriend thought sounded like Sidney Poitier, Xusia emerging from a mud bath, a witch who hilariously over emotes before her internal organs fly out of her chest, and a bunch of battles we never see.

Flash forward a few years. Talon is now a tough looking guy who wears a lot of furs and has head of hair that rivals Paul Atreides's coif in David Lynch's ""Dune."" Talon spends his days riding the countryside as a Robin Hood, rescuing damsels and restoring kingdoms. It isn't too long before Talon and his gang of dirty mercenaries meet up with Princess Alana and Prince Mikah. Mikah is ready to launch an insurrection against Cromwell when he is double crossed by the evil king's wily advisor Machelli, a man who has his own ideas about who should hold the throne. Talon finds himself trying to rescue Mikah while trading risque quips with Alana. There are a whole slew of fights, some swordplay, a few mild gore scenes, and even some nudity thrown in for good measure. Talon gets his showdown with King Cromwell in an ending that has a few twists that aren't really surprises. As the credits roll, Pyun promises us a sequel about Talon's further adventures, a film that never materialized for some reason.

I think the best thing going for ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is that it never takes itself too seriously. All the actors, especially Horsley, ham it up with relish. It is difficult not to see some humor in a script full of this many innuendos. Sure, this endless barrage of quips grates after awhile, but when the dialogue starts to get you down there are other things you notice. For example, there are plenty of implausible events occurring every few minutes. You gotta love it when Talon, during his crucifixion, pulls his hands out of the wood through sheer strength and then manages to wield a three bladed sword in an epic battle. And what's with that weird battle ballet sequence? Laughing at this scene alone is worth shelling out a few bucks for the movie.

Alas, the DVD has only two theatrical trailers and a television spot as extras, although one of the trailers contains a scene that doesn't appear in the film. I guess Pyun doesn't do commentaries for his movies; he is probably too busy lining up financing for his next bomb. As for picture and sound quality, they aren't great. As far as the picture goes, the smoky, dank sets probably meant the original print wasn't that great to start with. If you like low budget films with lots of action, occasional overacting, and scantily clad women, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is right up your alley. I went out of my way to see this because when it came out in the theaters I was too young to get in and too naive to sneak in. A few years later, I finally snuck in to Dudikoff's ""American Ninja."" Yes, I know, I know; I should have stuck with this one instead.",1058227200,5,5504,4.7531380753138075
1407767,4,B000059PP2,"Chances are very good you've never even heard of ""The Sword and the Sorcerer,"" a fantasy film from the 80s that got lost amidst ""Conan the Barbarian"" and its ilk. Despite the fact that one of the world's worst directors (Albert Pyun) is at the helm, this is one of the better sword n' sorcery films to come out of the decade. It may not be the aforementioned classic, but it ranks alongside ""The Beastmaster"" and ""Dragonslayer"" quite readily - though this is decidedly more adult in its presentation given its violence and sexuality.
The story centers around Talon, a mercenary warrior who seems to lack much in the way of principle, but who also happens to be the son of Adon's slain king. When he was a boy, his entire family was slaughtered before his eyes by the evil Cromwell, who has now forcefully gained the throne. Cromwell is not the only villain, however, for the sorcerer Xusia also lusts for the kingdom of Adon - and for vengeance against Cromwell, who betrayed him. All the while, the rabble of Adon prepare for revolution, and look to a reluctant Talon for guidance.
""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" benefits from its surprisingly good storyline and its entertaining characters, but the film's sense of humor is what truly sets it apart, as it knows never to take itself TOO seriously, despite its vengeance-driven plotline. Given the film's meager production values and cheesey ambience, this is a blessing indeed. It's hard to knock a movie that's knocking itself. While it will certainly not garner high praise from all viewers, those who enjoy 80s fantasy should consider adding this to their collection immediately. Simply put, ""The Sword and the Sorcerer"" is bawdy fun.

1407768,1,B000059PP2,"I'm shocked at all these rave reviews. This movie is so horrible!
First of all, it speeds through a plot that drags with no body. This movie is confusing and empty of a good plot and dialogue.
I liked Krull way better than this and for some reason Krull got worse reviews. *shrugs* I don't understand. I guess to each their own.
One thing I can say it is better than Beastmaster 2, so if you are up for a cheesy sorcery movie than go for it, but honestly there are so many better fantasy movies out there. If I had a second chance, I wouldn't have wasted my dollar on renting it.",1032998400,5,579,4.132743362831858
1407769,4,B000059PP2,"Comparisons to ""Krull"" not withstanding, it is basically ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" meets ""The Archer.""  The music wonderfully accentuates the serial-caliber action.  There's a reason this film has come to DVD before David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" and that is because of its serial quality adventure appeal.  The quick one-liners that are almost in ""modern speak"" and non-stop action sequences almost betray a pre ""Hercules"" and ""Zena"" screenplay, but in a realistic context. Hollywood review-double speak aside, this was a movie that was fun to watch when I was a kid, an is still fun now.  The story holds up to a ""realism"" critique in a way the 1990's tv's ""Zena"" and ""Hercules"" can't.  Although it may not be able to compete with the power of the original ""Conan,"" viewed in the light of its contemporaries ""Raiders"" and ""Remo Williams"" the movie ""Sword an the Sorcerer"" deserves its place among cinematic's magic films.  It's ability to be viable for nearly twenty years is deservng of respect.  Keep it in your video library between Tom Cruise's ""Legend"" and ""Conan the Barbarian"" (and just to the left of ""Raiders"" and ""Excalibur"")",1018828800,,1136,4.947368421052632
1407770,4,B000059PP2,"When you go to a local burger joint, you know the guy who makes the burgers is there in the back just cranking the things out. His cuisine is never going to reign supreme on ""Iron Chef."" But does that stop you from going there? No -- if you want a perfect combination of grease, cheese, and charred animal proteins, you can still enjoy the heck out of a good burger.
That, in a nutshell, is The Sword and the Sorcerer. It's a brilliantly dumb movie that has no pretensions of being High Cinema, and as such it succeeds better than any other movie of heroic fantasy (especially Conan the Barbarian, which any reader of the books knows is watery-weak in plot and vacuum-sparse in its characterization).
See it for the sometimes striking and sometimes laughable special effects. See it for its fantastic, bombastic soundtrack. See it for hammy acting and borderline clever double-entendres, tons of bit parts by B-list actors, a swirlingly complex plot that really doesn't matter, and a swaggering hero who out-Conan's the Schwarzenneger Conan and manages to do it despite some wincingly bad hair days.

1407792,5,B000059PP2,"To think I had been in cut-throat bidding wars for mildewy shop-warn copies of this masterpiece in online bidding rooms.  Now it's on DVD!  HA!  This is my favorite Sword and Sorcery movie of all time.  Not as well written or acted by half as say, Conan, but by God it has something.  Demons and swords that shoot any number of blades...daring rescues...crucifixion...nudity.  It has it all.  I've been renting this movie since I was a kid, and now I own it.  Oh sweet happiness.  In all seriousness, the effects hold up, the dialogue is great, and any number of later tv stars pop up all over the place.  I could not recommend this more if I made money on it's sale.

1407793,4,B000059PP2,"This is a fun flick, plain and simple. The ""undemanding"" types (you know, the folks who like to be entertained and not preached to) will know why this movie is a classic upon one viewing, for it has all of the ingredients: timeless story, action for action's sake alone, beautiful women, a creepy demon, and non-stop glorious violence. No boring (and insincere) Hollywood commentaries on the unfairness of the modern class system, no politically correct BS, no attempts to be hip, just good cheesy fun. I could never understand why people who hate these kind of movies still insist upon watching them and then drone on and on about how much they hate it, ad nauseum, ad infinitum, etc. (they must all be critics who like fey ""art films"" and are paid by the word...). Low budget, perhaps...sometimes cheap looking, perhaps...but just keep in mind that twenty years from now all of the ""cutting edge"" contemporary films about ""virtual reality"" and hip-hop culture and computer generated monsters will look incredibly stupid.

I became quite confused about the relationships of all the kings, queens and princes of this film, but it has a huge cult status with our household.  Lee Horsely plays a great barbarian type of role (even though I think he is the dead kings son).  The sword he uses is spectacular!  I think you'll recognize who plays Jerusha - interesting role for him. Good fun flick.",994118400,,462,4.275862068965517
1407795,4,B000059PP2,"I was certain that I would never own a copy of The Sword and the Sorcerer in this day and age when it is seemingly forgotten - especially a copy on DVD. And yet, to my complete shock, I stumbled across it, brand new, and picked it up at once to add it to my ever-expanding collection of fantasy films.  The Sword and the Sorcerer is a rather obscure contender from the early '80s, and at a glance seems like a Conan the Barbarian clone given the poor box art and the many parallels between the films. The Sword and the Sorcerer has nothing on said classic fantasy, however, but offers many delights all its own, even if they are clothed sometimes in distasteful cheeseball ambience. While Conan the Barbarian is a dark, vengeance-driven epic, The Sword and the Sorcerer is a lighter (and, yes, vengeance-driven) adventure story with a healthy dosage of comedy that shows the film tries not to take itself too seriously. This sense of humor is what sets it apart from the rest, and is probably its finest attribute given its less respectable production values and acting.
The plot revolves around Prince Talon, a mercenary warrior who seems to lack much in the way of principle, who has wandered the land for many years seeking to reclaim the kingdom of Adon and avenge the deaths of his family at the hands of the evil Titus Cromwell. And yet Titus is not the only villain, for the sorcerer Xusia, whom Titus betrayed and thought slain by his own hand, has returned to claim vengeance of his own. All the while, the rabble of Adon prepare for revolution, with an unwitting Talon as their shining hope.
 This is certainly not a film that would ever garner high praise from all viewers, but to those who enjoy barbarian-style '80s fantasy with a touch of humor and a surprisingly interesting story, this is something you should consider adding to your collection. It is far more fun than a movie of this mold has a right to be, and I consider its DVD debut a very welcome, if surprising, thing.

1407797,5,B000059PP2,"Summary:  An Evil King seeks the aid of an evil sorcerer in order to conquer a peaceful kingdom. One of the good king's sons escapes and later seeks vengeance as an adult.
My Opinion:  This is a very fun movie. I loved at when I saw it years ago and I'm very glad to have it in my collection now. I loved Lee Horsley as Matt Houston and he is great here as well. This movie is one of those guilty pleasures for Fantasy fans. It may be cheesy and silly but it's so much fun that I don't even notice.
DVD Quality:  Pretty much bare bones with a couple of trailers. Hey at least it's on DVD!
What You Should Do:  If you are a SciFi or Fantasy fan and a collector, you should buy this DVD. I can't imagine them putting out a Special Edition of this one, so there's no need to wait. If you liked  Beastmaster, Krull, Dragonslayer, Conan or anything along those lines, then give it a rent. Otherwise skip it.",991094400,9,902,4.1022727272727275
1407798,4,B000059PP2,"First, let me emphasis what S&tS *isn't*: it isn't big budget, it doesn't have mind-blowing special effects, and it certainly doesn't have that mainstream American appeal that most of the films churned out of Hollywood seem to have. It doesn't have the polish of Krull, or the big-name actors of Conan, or the whiz-bang animatronics of Dragonslayer. Rather, it has a gritty, European import flavor, cheesy special effects, and has the requisite T&A one might expect from a movie of this calibre.
Now, let me discuss what S&tS is: it is a darn fine fantasy adventure movie, and perhaps the overall best one to come during that early 80's period where Dungeons & Dragons hit its apex of popularity. I make this observation based on the fact that it has no real weak points, and on the strength of the character actors that populated this film. Lee Horsley, as the protagonist Talon, has a combination of charm and presence unmatched by Arnold (Conan), Peter McNichol (Dragonslayer), Ken Marshall (Krull), and even Rutger Hauer (Ladyhawke). Veteran character actors Richard Lynch (Cromwell) and Richard Moll (Xuxa of Dulles) are outstanding in their portrayal of the finest antagonists this side of Legend's Tim Curry (Dark). True, Kathleen Beller detracts more than she adds, but Anthony De Longis and Simon MacCorkindale more than make up for her wooden performance. Save for Beller's Alana, all of the main characters exhibit remarkable depth and dimension for a B-movie, much less an A-movie.
The plot is somewhat preposterous, even for a fantasy film, but it is intriguing, and draws you in. Light humor is applied liberally and intelligently throughout as a contrast to the drama and danger, and is spaced such that one feels as if he's on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. This is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it attempt to teach a moral lesson to the viewer. Simply stated, this is a good, old-fashioned, high-adventure romp.
My only criticisms are that the DVD is lacking in features (subtitles would've been nice), and the editing of the film, particularly in the climactic final battle, is pretty poor; a director's cut of this film would have been most welcome.  Otherwise, this is a film that belongs in the collection of every fantasy genre fan.",990144000,8,2292,4.953246753246753
1407799,4,B000059PP2,"This DVD has its share of shortcomings, in particular in the lack of extra features (Only some trailers!). The sound is 5.1, but makes little to no use of that fact.
The movie itself has a few areas of confusion... Wasn't that Talon's sister carted away as a child at the beginning? But when we next see them as adults, Alana is Mikah's sister... so what happened to Talon's sister? And why doesn't Talon reveal himself to be the rightful heir to the throne? Does Mikah ever learn who Talon really is? And the credits list actor for ""young Mikah""... where did we ever see Mikah as a child? Was this left on the cutting room floor?
Overall, I still like this movie. Not nearly as good as Dragonslayer, but still very fun to watch. There are a few partial nude scenes, and Xusia is pretty darn gruesome, so you might not want to let the kids watch this one. Too bad there aren't more fantasy movies on DVD... I keep waiting for Dragonslayer, but it just doesn't seem be happening. I suspect LOTR will be on DVD before Dragonslayer!
