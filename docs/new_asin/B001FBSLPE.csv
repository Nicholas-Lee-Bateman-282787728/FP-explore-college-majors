3584553,5,B001FBSLPE,"Sure, there were problems with the movie, but the script was dead on.  Keep your eye on the first time screenwriter, Ty Lieberman.  You're going to see big things from him!",1229212800,4,172,4.516129032258065
3584554,5,B001FBSLPE,"While some of the performances are a little disappointing, this movie clearly derived from an excellent script by Ty Lieberman.  The core story is both funny and touching and the humor is very good.  Watch it, you'll like it.",1228435200,,225,4.743589743589744
3584555,3,B001FBSLPE,"You say you always wanted to see a gay version of Julia Roberts' ""My Best Friend's Wedding""?  Well, the Here! TV made-for-cable film ""Kiss the Bride"" (2007) comes pretty close, but nowhere near as good or funny.

Matthew (Philip Karner) is the editor of a San Francisco-based gay magazine, working on a special article about gay marriages, and being deluged by invitations by couples wanting their ceremony to be featured.  Among the pile of invitations, he spots one with the name of his boyhood best friend (and first lover) back in New Mexico, Ryan (James O'Shea) who - to Matthew's surprise - is marrying Alex, a woman, played by Tori Spelling. Matthew decides to attend the wedding, and satisfy his curiousity as to whether Ryan is indeed gay and, if so, perhaps talk him out of getting married.  A very colorful supporting cast dictates much of the action from there, first mistaking Matthew for the stripper hired for Alex's bridal shower (Trivia note: the stripper that eventually shows up is Dean McDermott, Tori's real-life spouse), and then being invited to stay with Ryan and Alex in their guest room, in between outings with their respective dysfunctional families.

I get the feeling that the screenwriter was going for some sort of ""message"" beyond the normal scope of a fluffy romantic comedy, but I came away unsure what that message was supposed to be.  Obviously, he was making a point that sometimes people make wrong choices because they feel powerless to do otherwise, or perhaps he was saying that gay/straight sexuality is not a matter of black and white, but of shades of gray.  In any case, the message is muddled with a sophmoric storyline, with some ""what were they thinking?"" moments (such as when Matthew is caught in bed with Alex, and reportedly is aroused) and weak direction.  I found the acting capable, for the most part, with Spelling actually pretty good, with the weakest link likely Karner, whose character carried most of the scenes. Currently on rotation on Here! TV, and available on DVD (extras include lengthy background and deleted scenes which make the direction seem even more questionable). More disappointing than awful, and has a few amusing moments. I give it three stars out of five.",1228348800,4,2236,4.912466843501326
3584556,3,B001FBSLPE,"My partner and I watched this last night with high expectations.  After all, Latter Days was such a wonderful movie.  Big disappointment.  Some of the acting was not up to par, and I kept waiting for some really good dialogue between the characters, but it never happened.
My biggest beef with this movie is the scene where the gay guy is making out with the fiance of ""the love of his life"".  That was so wrong; it didn't work with the rest of the movie.  I lost all respect for him at that moment.  It didn't make any sense at all, and more or less ruined what was otherwise a fair movie.",1227657600,3,590,4.223214285714286
3584567,4,B001FBSLPE,"Not the average boring gay film. This one has good actors, a good story line, this one is funny and entertaining. An all around good film to watch",1304467200,,146,4.25
3584568,5,B001FBSLPE,"The movie is nice, the director is for sure good. Maybe in comparison to Latter Days it has a bit more the feeling of low budget movie, but it's not something that weight too much on the quality. It has the merit to show what it can be the life in a small town for a gay boy; when you feel alone in your same home, maybe friendship could be mistaken for love, and when you are forced apart from that love, it becomes more perfect than what it really was.",1278288000,,454,4.0
3584569,5,B001FBSLPE,"Amusing, fun, semi-sexy, and just a plain good movie.  If you want a light hearted, feel good film try this one.  It does have its moments of seriousness, but on the whole its a romp that will keep you entertained.",1240790400,,214,4.325
3584570,2,B001FBSLPE,"Caution: Spoilers. A silly plot and unsatisfying ending. A gay man is on the brink of getting into a hetero marriage when the long lost gay ""love of his life"" returns (at the bride's secret invitation to ""test"" her finance's true orientation) to try to ""save"" him (a la ""My Best Friend's Wedding""). The gay lovers decide to forego their love for each other because the long lost friend thinks the bride-to-be is ""cool."" So the gay groom-to-be and the bride-to-be decide, at the alter, to have a commitment ceremony instead of a wedding. DUMB,DUMB, DUMB, but then Tori S. does play the bride. The only redeeming feature of the film is the male ""eye candy"" on display.",1240531200,,666,4.6525423728813555
3584571,3,B001FBSLPE,"The irony is the special features BEHIND THE SCENES keeps telling us the ending will be a total surprise and yet the final scene of the featurette shows the ending.  As well, there is nothing predictable about this feature.  Where you think the film and characters are going to go is exactly where they go.  The only question is why it seems to take so long to get there.

On the plus side, the supporting cast is great but largely wasted.  One of the supporting actors has most of her scenes left on the cutting room floor, presumably for pace considerations, but it really provides her some moments and especially some input into her life that it's a shame the scenes are cut from the film.

One of the supporting cast is Charlie David and his appearance in the film is another broadcast of where the story will end up.  His association with DANTE'S COVE HERE! series has provided him inclusion into a lot of other films, and his limited talent and appeal are debatable.

The two male leads are very attractive.  However, the scenes taking place ten years earlier in their relationship does not serve the film well, the guys are obviously much older playing teenagers.  Probably the scenes should have been filmed in black and white or sepia toned or any way to soften their hard edges (facially as well as in their adult musculature).

Tori Spelling steals the show as her character - which could be annoying as she is so perfect and perfectly adorable - never manages to grate.  You can see why her fiance wants to marry her and why the old boyfriend ends up loving her too.",1239494400,,1578,4.5371024734982335

3584574,4,B001FBSLPE,"this review is actually written by bruce's longterm life-partner, dennis milam.""kiss the bride"" was nicely written and paced and the acting was overall good. it was refreshing to see a same-sex romance that did not have to end either tragically or madly-in-love but was more realistic. the special treat was seeing steve sandvoss on the screen again. after his debut in ""latter days"" i'd hoped he'd be discovered and his talent would be recognized. he's kept working steadily according to his website. here,he gets a chance to play a comedic role. he is so good he disappears into it. it took a while to realize who the actor was! his comedic timing was sharp and he made the goofy character come alive and be lovable. the scenes at the stripper club parking lot were memorable. on a more superficial level,it was good to see him with facial hair.i'd seen him with it on his website/other films. however, he's not just another handsome face but has real talent.",1232668800,10,961,4.7604790419161676
3584575,5,B001FBSLPE,"This is a fun film, showing that Tori Spelling is more then just her last name. She shines in her role as Alex, a quirky fun-loving woman about to marry.

3584576,3,B001FBSLPE,"((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form. Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and your comments/reviews at various on-line sites. Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some of the ""near-Addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

I'll admit that on first watching I was mightily disappointed, particularly in view of what I consider C. Jay Cox's much better, gay-related work, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Latter-Days-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0002I84JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Latter Days (Unrated Edition)</a>.""  However, repeat viewings of ""Bride"" have resulted in my initial impression taking on a somewhat more positive spin, as you may gather from other of my comments, below. In this work it seems the director and writer are trying to tell.....no, make that show.....us that sexual preference (if not also orientation), is not just a black or white, a yes or no thing; rather it's a continuum and can change over time. Still, even if you consider that theme to be well handled, in no way does this production come close to achieving/maintaining the high interest levels being attained by that other recent gay film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>,"" directed by newcomer Jonah Markowitz.}

If by now you're wondering, this movie......if it's anything......is a ""seriocomedy."" It is NOT a gay romance (although at an earlier, teenage time in our two male leads' lives, there might have been the beginning spark of romance). No, come to think of it, even then it was more likely to have been just youthful lust. So, with that out of the way, you might ask how this production works as a semi-serious comedy. On this, all I can say is that in such a genre, comic timing is everything, and I suspect that comedy performance has not been in the background of either of our male leads (but older, supporting cast members Tess Harper and Robert Foxworth keep the chuckles coming fairly reliably). Karner / O'Shea almost get it on the button at times.......but a successful comedy needs more than ""almost"" when it comes to timing. Still, what Philipp Karner (Matt) does do well is deliver sincerity---and you're going to like him for that. And then there's James O'Shea (Ryan), who effectively gives us a ""confused sweetness""---you'll fall for that as well. Oh, yes, and he also ""puts out"" for us in the form of a good looking face and an excellent body (and er, ahem, that includes a great ass and a nice package---more than enough there to have shared with a Karner, who could stand a ""boost"" in those departments). As for Spelling, I'm not a ""Tori-fan,"" but she does come across as miles better here than she was in another gay film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trick/dp/0780629167/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trick</a>.""

Along with secondary character actress Amber Benson, we also have Steve Sandvoss, and both are ""carryovers"" from ""Latter Days."" Sandvoss' character and a ""buddy,"" played by Michael Medico, are given fairly frightful parts in the opinion of this viewer. Even so, it's too bad that whoever put together/approved the Cast List for the film's Closing Credits didn't know enough to realize they'd gotten these two player's character names reversed (that must make one feel good as an actor).

One last point, for those of you who might keep up with such things: Karner does get from O'Shea a lot better lip-locks (both in quality and number) than does Spelling. How about them apples?

PS--This DVD won't get tossed out in the trash (as some have been)----but it's hardly likely to make it onto this viewer's ""Addictive"" list*** either.  Oh, and we appear to have a couple of Ty Lieberman fans here; which is fine---although they don't appear to have reviewed anyone else's films at this site.

If it sounds slightly familiar to you, don't look any further than this film itself. In one of the dialogues pops-up a title of another ""wedding"" comedy and that is ""My best friend's wedding"". Yep, ""Kiss the..."" has some resomblence to its predecessor, unfortunately is not equally wonderful.
