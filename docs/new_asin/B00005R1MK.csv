1652389,3,B00005R1MK,"Okay folks, I felt it was time to put my two cents in.  I understand some of you being upset about this movie, but there are some circumstances that you must know.  The first thing is that this movie was originally released by MTI Home Video which did the cover art and included all of the extras.  When MTI sold the distribution rights to 20th Century, MTI neglected to contact my brother and Ken Mader to also include the extras.  20th Century in all their (not so great) wisdom released the movie without the extras, but never changed the box art.  For those people that wanted the extras, you should go to 20th Century and give them your mind!

Now, as for the movie; I was obviously very close to the making of this movie, but not directly involved.  I know how much dedication my brother and Mader and all the others put into this.  I give it a solid 3 rating because of my knowledge of the movie.  This movie having been created by my brother is a part of me.  The indoor scenes were shot in my brothers basement and the set work, I thought, was amazing for some amateurs!  The spooky house was none other than our parents house and so it is with great pleasure that I watch this movie.  Not the best, but something I can appreciate and something the my family appreciates.

The making of this movie also helped me in more ways than I had expected.  I now like to buy movies in those Walmart bins and the more obscure, the better.  I enjoy some of the worst movies, because I remember the time and effort my brother and Mader put into theirs and so I feel a sense of dedication to the many others that are trying to do the same.  I refuse to knock the other ""bad"" movies, made by small-town people that are just trying to ""break through"" and be recognized.  I will, however, knock the big budget, big studio, big actor junk movies.

Thanks,

David L. Kurtz",1102550400,2,1863,4.301724137931035
1652390,1,B00005R1MK,"The movie -- trash!  The DVD box art says that Carnivore is a widescreen presentation that is `digitally mastered'. The film is NOT in widescreen, and `digital mastering' can only mean that either the master exists on some kind of digital medium, or worse, that the film was `mastered to digital' in the sense that DVDs were made from the master (obviously, since the product is a DVD).

The transfer is one of the poorer ones that I've seen (unfortunately it isn't the worst). It is extremely grainy (it looks like it was recorded from a VHS tape that had been rented about 300 times in the mid-80s, and then stored in a mildew-filled basement for 10 years), The sound has a lot of hiss and was equalized with far too much bass--you have to crank up the treble, crank up the volume, and you still can't hear dialogue in some scenes. I don't know what aspect ratio directors F. Joseph Kurtz and Kenneth Mader filmed in, but the framing suggests that it _wasn't_ filmed in `full-screen' (1.33 : 1), which is the aspect ratio on this disc.

Additional bad news is that the box art also promises a director commentary, a featurette called `Carnivore Kills!', a trailer, and optional Spanish subtitles. None of these are on the disc. Instead, the disc has two menu options. One for `Play Movie' and one for `Scene Selection'--which gives you access to only eight chapter markings. This is either a serious case of false advertising or an equally serious screw-up on the manufacturing end. And in both cases, it would probably be best for everyone to send their copies of the DVD back to 20th Century Fox and demand a refund plus a free copy of the DVD when the corrections are made. Even if some of the problems (such as the sound) are rooted in the source material, these can be fairly easily rectified in a moderately-equipped recording/engineering studio.",1099612800,3,1854,4.663608562691132

True, CARNIVORE is not a great film. Not only is the story unoriginal, but it never really gets moving. It's a SLOW film, with much yakking and wandering about an empty house.

A government scientist, working alone in an isolated suburban house, is killed by the monster he's created. A rubber-suited creature with almost comical mannerisms (the way he keeps withdrawing his arm, playfully, as the scientist tries to give him an injection -- right before he kills the scientist -- but why?)

The military learns of his death because video cameras transmitted it to Washington. Which is good, because that scientist was the ONLY employee working on the project, in that house in Illinois. HUH?

So the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency dispatches a ""crack team"" to drive over there and tranquilize the monster, which is presumed to still be in the house. Apparently, there is no one in all the state of Illinois that the federal government can send. No field officers or local military bases.

Instead, this crack team must drive from D.C. to Illinois Not fly. But drive. And not too fast. They can't break any speed limits because ""We don't want to call attention to our mission.""

The team consists of two Secret Service types (black suits, dark glasses, curt dialog) and a leggy blonde  in a business suit. The Secret Service types discuss their Uzi machine-guns while the leggy blonde warns them not to use guns, because the monster must be tranquilized.

Meanwhile, four teenagers break into the abandoned house, hoping to party, get drunk, have sex. Naturally, the monster finds them...

Some comical cops also arrive, as do the government agents. Yet considering all the people present, there is a surprisingly LOW body count. Practically no one gets killed.

MUCH of the film is of the teenagers wandering about the house, exchanging aimless dialogue. I suppose it's meant to be ""filler."" The cops also exchange the usual filler dialogue -- debating the merits of junk food vs. health food. Even so, this film is very short. About 75 minutes, not including credits.

One nice thing about CARNIVORE is the colored lighting, mainly blue. It adds a touch of atmosphere to a largely drab film. (Perhaps the colored light were inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B000S0GYRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>&nbsp;and its copycats? -- NO, I'm not saying CARNIVORE is anywhere near as great as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B000S0GYRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>)

According to the IMDb, CARNIVORE began shooting in 1989, and it shows. The big hair, the clothes (nearly as ridiculous as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Demon-Wind/dp/B00009RS0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Demon Wind</a>), the old cars, the hair band music at film's end. Instead of cell phones, one teen talks on an old landline in his room -- at least it was push button. The cop has a large walkie-talkie.

CARNIVORE is listed as a 2000 film. That's how long it took to find ""completion funds"" and distribution.",1366329600,,3616,5.984496124031008
7951397,5,B00005R1MK,Funny watching first attempts at a dinosaur in movies. They have come a long way to Jurassic Park. But a lot of fun.,1363910400,,116,4.086956521739131
7951398,1,B00005R1MK,"Despite the promising cover - this movie was bad. Really bad. Not in the ""so bad its good"", but just bad.
The acting is bad, the setting is bad, the plot is bad, the monster effects are bad, the jokes are bad, the mood is bad. Despite low expectations at the outset, this movie STILL managed to disappoint, it's that bad.
The only thing NOT bad is the DVD cover artwork. That's it. (Which is why I picked it up at the local library in the first place - please don't waste any money on this.)
This is apparently some kind of home movie attempt at a monster movie and how it ever got a DVD release is beyond me. It's like the type of movie you'd encounter on youtube - one made by drunk college students who don't realize how bad their production really is. I might have been a little more forgiving if it was only that, with about an hour or more cut from the running time.

7951399,2,B00005R1MK,"Those wacky kids are never going to learn. You don't just break into abandoned houses, hoping to party with your buddies, and expect to get out of there alive. It's just not the way it works. That old house everyone says is cursed? It is. The stories folks tell about something evil living in the house? It does. The rumors of teens going into the house and never making it back out? They're true. So when your brilliant idea is to get your friend, his girlfriend and his girlfriend's sister, along with a case of beer your brother bought for you, and go spend the night in the old Romero house, you can't be surprised when one or two of you gets their guts splattered all over the wall.

In this particular case, the house in question is owned by the US Department of Intelligence, which is using it as a secret lab where they're working on a top secret project to create the ultimate killing machine. The problems only start when the secret project kills its creator and gets loose in the house. Agent in charge Dana Anderson is dispatched from Washington DC along with two incompetent field agents to contain the situation and deal with the Carnivore. But before they can get there, Scott and his buddy Marc, Marc's girlfriend Dee, and Dee's sister Bobbi are going to hang out and get drunk in what, on the surface, appears to be just another empty Illinois house. Granted, if they'd stumbled upon the hidden lab beneath the house . . . no, it wouldn't have matter; these four were way too stupid already and would have stayed and wound up dead anyway.

See, the Carnivore won't kill unless it's threatened, but its creator, Dr. Westmont, was in the process of helping the creature with its pheromone imbalance: seems the creature can't tell the difference between fear and arousal. So when Marc and Bobbi sneak off to spend some horizontal time alone, the creature, mistaking Marc's turned-onness for fear, attacks.

The other three make their escape, but not before the cops show up. Sheriff Holt orders Deputy Bryant to check out the dead body, which leads Deputy Bryant to having his face chewed off. Sheriff Holt makes his escape, but not before Dana Anderson shows up with her DIA field agents, Liddy and North. Anderson and Liddy go inside to check out the situation and, hopefully, contain the Carnivore with a tranquilizer dart. At least, that's the plan, but Liddy desperately wants to use his Uzi, so we'll see how that goes.

In the end, after 80 minutes of this nonsense, I have to say that whatever grand scheme writer/director/producer/executive producer/production designer/editor/set constructionist/camera operator/cinematographer/etc Kenneth Mader had in mind for his big debut, CARNIVORE must surely have fallen far short of that mark. At least, I hope so, because if this is the movie he INTENDED to make . . . he's drawing inspiration from the totally wrong influences.

I get that CARNIVORE qualifies as a micro-budget movie and was probably made for a couple thousand bucks, but there's nothing wrong with hiding that fact and trying to make your movie look like you put some effort into it. I'm sure creature effects are expensive, I get that. Then you know what, don't rely so much on showing the creature. There are ways to work around that, to shoot the monster in a way that doesn't reveal just how goofy the cheap costume looks.

Also, this is a horror movie, ease up on the comedy relief. In fact, with as little tension and suspense as this movie has, there's very little need for any kind of relief in the first place. But if you insist, then do so in moderation. As it is, Mader's got three small plots all coming together to form the greater whole. There's the teens in the house plot, the agents in transit plot, and the cops on duty plot. And every single time we switch scenes, one of these characters is cracking wise. Marc in the house thinks he's hilarious. Agent Liddy is just smarmy and arrogant but dumb as a post, which comes across as silly. And Randy Craig, who plays Sheriff Holt, obviously thinks he's Kevin Pollack.

As for the acting, I'm going to go out on a limb and say Mader hired either his friends or a bunch of locals. Considering none of the principles have gone on to star in anything else, I'm opting for the former. And trust me when I tell you, Mader, despite being a ""filmmaker"", is not friends with any actors. At least he wasn't when he was making CARNIVORE. They gave it a shot, but they obviously knew they were making a cheap, crappy horror movie, and they each set their skill level to accommodate.

I'm all for the DIY approach. It would be the way I'd want to do things if I made movies. Quality control and all that. But jeez, dude, there has to be some quality to control. CARNIVORE was just a cheap, silly movie that doesn't even succeed on a cheesy level.",1343865600,,4834,4.612790697674418
