219558,5,6300182061,"The film was richly acted and memoriable, about the skiier whose tragic fate changed her life to that of a paraplegic. Equally tragic, was her friend who suffered from polio, but triumphantly rose out of the iron lung to battle this ugly disease which affficted some of the population. It is about Kinmont's struggle to reclaim her independence and to understand her newly aquired disability with a courageous face. A must for everyone to see.",1029456000,8,443,4.92
219559,5,6300182061,"This wonderful movie tells the story of world class skier Jill Kinmont, who seemed destined to reach the very pinnacle of her career, until a tragic accident left her a quadriplegic who would be confined to a  wheelchair for the rest of her life, and her struggle to forge a new and  meaningful life for herself in a world which can be very cruel at times,  especially to people who have a  physical disability.  A truly  inspirational story which shows that life can indeed continue and can even  be good, even in the face of overwhelming odds.  A must see for anyone who  doubts the existence of true courage in the face of adversity or the  remarkable resilience of the human spirit.  Jill Kinmont, you're amazing!",960940800,40,717,4.611111111111111

219822,5,6300182061,"This is a powerful film of the courage and true story of a hopeful Olympic Ski Champion who has an accident while skiing and becomes paraplegic.

To go from the pinnacle of physical accomplishment to being physically incapacitated from your life dream can be devastating. Yet, Jill Kinmont had a level of courage that is inspiring and a standard of excellence for all of us to follow.

It is a film for the entire family and is a tour de force for Marilyn Hassett who faced being physically incapacitated at one point in her own life. No doubt that actual experience gave her an insight about the life and adversity of Jill Kinmont that could not be conveyed to the audience by another actress.",1398124800,,694,4.588709677419355

219852,5,6300182061,I loved this movie from the very first time I saw it in theaters many years ago. All the parts were well cast and well played. Ms Hasset certainly is convincing as a young paralyzed girl. I don't know if it was over dramatized or not regarding her romance but I enjoyed the way it was portrayed in the movie.,1380931200,,308,4.15

219856,5,6300182061,"I first saw this movie when I was 9 year old. At that age, I looked through or past the romance, and felt deeply inspired by Jill Kinmont's story. She made me set two goals in my life: 1; To make it to the Olympic Games, and 2: that ANYTHING can be overcome. Perseverance and tenacity will get one through all obstacles in life.
Well, I reached that goal of making it to the Olympic Games (twice), as well as persevering through every obstacle, and there were many. However, I never had the physical obstacles that she overcame. She was my hero then and for a long long time. I bought this movie on dvd in order to show my children and hopefully to inspire them also. I still can look past the reviewers' and critics' ire at the ""cheesy romance"", and I do still feel inspired by Jill Kinmont's amazing story. We are short on true heros these days, and she truly is one. The world lost the real Jill Kinmont in 2012, but she went on to fight the status quo and to fight for disabled rights through her entire life. A beautiful soul she was and is.",1376784000,,1046,4.235

219926,4,6300182061,"Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable movie, inspiring and romantic.  But it seems a little too much in places, unrealistic.  Marilyn Hassett and Beau Bridges both put in what seem like heartfelt performances.  Bridges is both romantic and sad in his portrayal of Dick Buek, champion ski racer and daredevil boyfriend of Jill Kinmont (Hassett).  You get the impression there is more to his story, and we never find out what that is.  This left me wanting to know more.  Hassett though seems over the top at times in her emotional expressions.  This may be one reason why she never really went that far as an actress in her own right.  She may have been just about perfect for this role, but she obviously was rather limited in her general acting talent.  But again, the movie is a heartwarming one, and one to see and own, to watch again and again.",1339286400,,851,4.509803921568627
219927,5,6300182061,"I was 16 years old when I first saw this movie. That day it became my favorite movie of all time. It was beautful and tragic at the same time. Marylin Hassetts portral of Jill should have earned her an award of some kind. However,After this movie and part 2, I never heard of her again. Dramatic licenseing was taken between the relationship of Jill and Dick. In reality they were very good freinds and he did help her to learn to live again. The sking is about one third of the movie and it gives you a great look of how the early skiers had it. From their equipment to being pulled with tow ropes gives you an idea of what it was like in the fiftys. Charles fox, who wrote the soundtrack,did an incredible job. I had the album soundtrack for years. If I knew how to get it on CD,I would. Marylins narration gives you a look into Jills thoughts. She should have won some kind of award for her work in both films. I've never heard her name again. Jill was 10 years older than Marilyn but she pulled it off well. I started thinking about Jill kinmont in March for some reason. To my amazement,I discovered Jill had died in Feb. 2012 at age 75. Marilyn Hassett if you see this, contact me.",1337472000,,1187,4.2105263157894735
219928,4,6300182061,"I remember seeing this as a kid, and how much it resonated with me at the time.  It is a tragic story, to be sure, and this movie is definitely one of those tearjerkers that plays on your emotions to get the point across.  The music swells in just the right places--at all the perfect pivotal moments--thus pushing all the right emotional buttons to great effect.  It's all very obvious, and undoubtedly designed to wrench every tear from your heart as the story unfolds.  That's why it was the blockbuster hit that it was back in the day.  Still...it is very effectively done, and beautifully acted by everyone in the cast--Marilyn Hassett in particular.  Yes, it could have been more subtly rendered, but, still, it really does the job well if you can abide such sappiness.  I sat through it again tonight, with a more astute eye for its interpretation of the story, and still felt that proverbial lump in my throat over and over, once again, even with the benefit of hindsight and clarity that age sometimes brings to one's esthetic.

I would still recommend this to anyone with a soft heart, and the capacity for imagining what could have been, under different circumstances. The Olivia Newton-John song, ""Richard's Window""--a reference to the late Dick Buek--at the end of the movie--is the proverbial nail in the coffin.  Watch it and weep.  Is the emotion one feels for this tragic character who rises from the ashes any less meaningful in spite of all of the intended shmaltz?  In my estimation, no.  Sometimes this kind of movie is just a balm for the soul.  It was like visiting an old friend seeing it again last night.  I had some reservations about purchasing the On Demand dvr offered here, but aside from two hiccups in the movie toward the end, it played beautifully on my 31"" television--in letterbox, as it should be seen.",1330646400,2,1840,4.691588785046729

219941,5,6300182061,"I was drawn to this movie because I recalled my two older sisters seeing it at the time of it's theatrical release and saying how great it was.  I might have been twelve then and I was more inclined to see ""Jaws"" for a fourth time than waste my time on a girly flick.  Regardless, this recalled to me a film from 1956 called ""Interrupted Melody"" that starred the incomparable Eleanor Parker as a rising opera singer who was felled by polio at the heighth of her fame.  The distinction between these two films is that Parker's character's illness did not silence her voice but the result of Jill Kinmont's(Marilyn Hassett) skiing accident means she cannot renew a semblance of the life she once knew.  Prior to her accident the world was Kinmont's oyster.  She was at the top of her game and headed to the 1956 Winter Olympics.  Like many athletes her drive and determination belied some narcissism and arrogance.  When the reality of permanent paralysis hits her Jill has new obstacles to overcome.  Not only does she have to tackle her physical shortcomings but she has to rebuild herself as a person.  Jill's journey is both grueling and touching.  Hassett, an actress who inexplicably fell off the map after starring in an adaptation of Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar"" in 1979, does monumental work assaying the transitions that Kinmont has to go through to realize her true worth as a person.  The physical demands of the role as well as the emotional ones are handled seamlessly by Hassett.  There's a side story involving a relationship with a daredevil skier played by Beau Bridges that could scuttle the movie but that's not the case.  Instead of being a time capsule curio ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" is relevant today because it's themes are universal.",1327190400,5,1765,4.728758169934641

219947,5,6300182061,"This film is so beautifully crafted that it deserves to be recognized as one of the most inspiring and uplifting films ever made.  You cannot watch THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN and possibly feel sorry for yourself.  The film demands the viewer to find his or her own strength within no matter what his circumstances are.  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN was a surprise hit for Universal back in 1975.  With no advanced publicity,  the studio hurried  it into movie theaters after a private screening at Universal that left all it's top executives in tears.  I remember it as ""the film that would not go away"".  Word of mouth spread about how effective and moving it was keeping The Other Side of the Mountain playing in various movie houses off and on  for years.  This new DVD transfer under the VAULT SERIES collection is GORGEOUS.  The sound crisp and the widescreen colors intact.  I think the film holds up better today than it did in 1975.  It may not be a critics picture but The Other Side of the Mountain works in the way THE SOUND OF MUSIC works or TITANIC or even Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE.  Yes, it's glossy, but the story touches on all the elements that a person going through this experience would face in reality.  Only the hardest of heart will not be moved.  Without giving too much of the plot away, the main character is forced to deal with a new reality.  There's the ineffective parents who can only give her love and little else.  The best friend that reminds her of how bad everything is.  The boyfriend who dumps her because he cannot come to terms with her ""new reality"" and then the man who re-enters her life to reconnect her with the spirit she thought she had lost.  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN is a movie about the individual, a loner on her own path and the struggles she must endure and overcome in order to find her true spirit.  This film contains Beau Bridges best performance.  The entire film rests on the shoulders of Marilyn Hassett who holds the film together triumphantly.  It's a stirring performance that inspires hope, not pity.  Alot of top notch supporting work her also, Dabney Coleman, Nan Martin, Belinda Montgomery and the wonderfully funny Dori Brenner.  The effervescent score by Charles Fox is one of his best and  enhances the beauty of David Walsh's stunning cinematography and the emotion of Larry Peerce's sensitive direction.  This film should be in the library of every veterans hospital in this country, that's how important it is.  Definitely deserves to be reevaluated.",1301529600,7,2543,4.653932584269663

To rephrase his thought, Jill suggests there are likewise only two joys... One is having God answer all your prayers, the other is not receiving the answer to all your prayers...

The four words: Your injury is permanent' slam into Jill Kinmont's consciousness like a bullet... She was a ski champion, full of life, action and beauty... Now, almost totally paralyzed after a bad fall...

Being Quadraplegic, means that every aspect in her life is different from that point on... Her total care is left up to other people: She cannot bathe herself, feed herself, or dress herself... Jill automatically suffers the effects of having no arms and no legs, and becomes incontenant as well...

Marilyn Hassett makes Kinmont a fighter whose determination initially explodes and inspires some to have unreasonable expectations of her limited recovery... She tries to reach a state of empowerment, the right to feel proud of herself, and what she is, and what she does, and to have that pride recognized as acceptable by her love ones... The tender romance between her and Beau Bridges provides some fine moments...

220049,4,6300182061,"""The Other Side of the Mountain"" tells the true-life story of '50's Olympic skiing hopeful Jill Kinmont, whose career was cut short by a devastating skiing accident that left her a paraplegic.  The film follows her triumphant recovery and struggle to maintain a normal life.  As directed by Larry Peerce, the film is inspiring, funny, sad, filled with good performances and features the beautiful vistas of California's Eastern Sierra Madres, in particular those surrounding the lovely town of Bishop.  Unfortunately, David Seltzer's script is the weak link, as it never rises above the level of standard Hollywood biopic, with spotty dialog and a tendency to lapse into uncomfortable melodrama.  Still, most viewers will ignore the hoakum and be totally engrossed in Kinmont's story.

Little-know starlet Marilyn Hassett plays Kinmont, and it's a good performance--even though she's clearly in her mid-twenties, she's believable as a giggly adolescent, and appropriately plucky when in full survival mode after tragedy strikes.  Beau Bridges and Belinda J. Montgomery lend valuable support as first love (and fellow champion) Dick ""Mad Dog"" Buek

and childhood best friend Audra Jo, whose own career was ended by polio.  While Bridges is the big scene stealer as a maverick whose tough-love rehabilitation approach will undoubtedly raise eyebrows, Montgomery is the true standout as the kind of friend everyone should have.  Nan Martin and William Bryant as Jill's parents and Dabney Coleman (in an early role) as Jill's supportive coach round out the fine cast.  And for once that most overworked of cinematic conceits, namely the framing device, works wonderfully well as an older Jill looks back on her life while teaching a class of Indian children.

In all, ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" is an inspiring tale, with an ending that will leave all but the most jaded of viewers wiping away a tear or two.  And while the execution may be a tad hokey and uninspired, one thing is undeniable:  while most films fade from memory almost immediately, Kinmont's story will stay with you for a lifetime.  It's been nearly thirty years since I first saw this film, and to this day, whenever I pass through Bishop, I wonder how Jill is doing, and hope life has brought her all the happiness she deserves.  **** (out of *****)

A note to Universal Home Video:  you've released ""Gable and Lombard"" on DVD, which was a complete flop from 1976 and critically maligned as an inaccurate and dishonest portrait of the great screen couple.  ""The Other Side of the Mountain,"" however, was a box-office success in 1975 and in its 1976 reissue and received decent notices from critics, yet it languishes on VHS with no DVD release date in sight.
