1394472,4,B000055ZEZ,"Ok like another reviewer said you must realize your watching something like fritz the cat (and definatly smoke a bowl or two first) Dirty Duck is the tail of Willard who is a flop with the ladies and is in general the biggest wimp you will ever meet. Willard ends up taking the duck along with him after a bizzar predicted death. The duck ends up taking willard of a pointless journery that looks like its a combo of Fritz the cat and the beatles Yellow submarine processed in a blender, mix in some really low (but funny) humor. Then journy comes to a end that has to be one of the most messed up and twisted ending ever, you will have to see this movie for yourself. The movie as a hole dosen't really hold well and is really poorly animated and voice casted but that is half the point it even says so in the opening song. Most of this movie's score is made up from flo and eddie former members of the band  The turltles (and don't let their pop friendly past fool you their music in the flick is raw and funny, almost trey parker in style but way befor his time. I highly recomend this to any stoner who wants to trip to a movie. This movie works on all levels though. If you liked Yellow submarines crude and trippy style and want to try something more adult then this is one flim that will be worth your time.",1124236800,14,1314,4.173228346456693
1394473,5,B000055ZEZ,"probably one of the best animated films in the adult genre. very entertaining...Flo and Eddie are all up in it, and there's even a surprise apperance from yoko, john and the mother of invention himself..i am a rugrats fan and charles swenson delivers a top notch film that's sure to delight and amuse. the studio should make a low-budget sequel for all the new generation fans that appreciate this movie.",1028764800,8,404,4.785714285714286
1394474,4,B000055ZEZ,"Dirty Duck is a surprisingly funny low budget ""toon porno"" featuring two former members of Zappa's Mothers Of Invention and Flo and Eddie. The cultural references however, were old even when the movie came out in 1975. The movie follows Willard, a down on his luck loser [who has trouble attracting women] and the duck who's out to help him; and even includes a surprise ending. As for comparisons, this one is better than Fritz The Cat, especially since the great R. Crumb was against the Fritz movie from day one.",1007856000,5,515,4.670329670329671

7931355,5,B000055ZEZ,"If you love Zappa, if you love Flo and Eddie and understand the irreverent humor of both, this is the movie for you!  All the music in the film is by almost everyone in Zappa's 1971/72 ""Mothers Of Invention"".",1383782400,2,208,4.333333333333333
7931356,1,B000055ZEZ,"I saw this bomb at a late show right when it was released, which was under the title ""Cheap"" and that sure says it right. It isn't even about a duck. Being a major Zappa and also ""Flo & Eddie"" (Kaylan and Volman, the ex-Turtles singers who joined The Mothers for several albums) fan I thought there might be some good music but there isn't. It is an animated cartoon that a five year old could have drawn. There is no plot to speak of. This ""Down And Dirty Duck"" title nonsense only came about later when obviously they had to disguise what they were marketing. It was not shown in theaters under that title, in fact it was not shown in theaters much at all because managers had more sense. Often a horrible movie can be fun to watch in order to ridicule it. For that purpose it is ideal. For entertainment, it is a bomb and the original title ""Cheap"" describes it to a T.",1382486400,,872,4.227544910179641
7931357,3,B000055ZEZ,"I didn't watch it, it was a gift for a guy who was looking for a copy,  I don't really know if I'd of liked it, hated it or been bored. Still, it was great to find such an obscure film.

7931358,4,B000055ZEZ,"A simply funny stupid work is, probably, of just own producers' sexual delusions materialized in screen actions.

It is simply hard to tell what is about as some Jewish-like character of a shy boring insurance agent put in a charge of a duck-sex-predator revering at the end of the pipe female genitals and a wild sex following any agent's interaction with an opposite sex since such practically-consumed revelation.",1248220800,3,416,5.117647058823529
7931359,1,B000055ZEZ,"I got this out of curiosity... and all I can think after seeing this is... what the hell was that all about.

Overall it's really just pointless and odd... and this is coming from someone that likes oddball movies like Cool World and Wizards.  The animation reminds me of old cartoons that where made sometime in the 40s... mabe not... it's not that good.  If you have ever seen the realy old show Crusader Rabbit you might have an idea of how the animation is... and that had the excuse of being the first animated show for TV, so the animation couldn't be good, it wasn't in the budget since TV never got that kind of money.  This movie don't have that excuse

Beware this buy, Friz is better, ether of them, this is just horrid all around.",1230595200,,742,4.3478260869565215
7931360,2,B000055ZEZ,"The best thing about this sad excuse for an underground seventies cartoon is that no one is forcing you to watch it. I mean it's not like a scene from Clockwork Orange where the viewer is strapped in and their eyes propped open with coat hangers. That's the best thing about it. There are a few (maybe four even) moments of humor so crude it's funny but most of it isn't. So much for the movie's good points.

The animation is not only amateur it's deliberately lame which would make it a good match for the meandering/scattered writing that tries to pass as plot if such a match up could actually be thought of as desirable. It isn't! The combination teams up to make anyone wonder why they are subjecting themselves to this poorly animated passing of gas. Tiny bits of the musical soundtrack actually might have been turned into something (not sure what) if anyone associated with this project gave a damn which obviously no one did.

A couple of reviewers have suggested smoking something fairly pungent before watching Dirty Duck but I'd suggest a much more powerful narcotic. Maybe a half pan of brownies but a proper antidote for this boring animated mess probably lay somewhere in the truly psychedelic category. If you have too much respect for your body to do that then show your mind the same and don't bother with this movie.",1201305600,,1336,4.632911392405063
7931361,1,B000055ZEZ,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - even for X-rated.  The

animation was poor at best and the movie itself barely deserves the X

rating save for a few scenes.  The main character Willard(not Dirty Duck)

is visually portrayed as a stick figure similar to animation of the 1930s.

X-rated movies usually don't have good plots to begin with but this one

makes Fritz The Cat look like classic cinema.",1179273600,3,413,4.5
7931362,3,B000055ZEZ,"I take issue with the other reviewer's claim about racism.

The middle class racist hang ups portrayed in the subway scene

were those of ther protagonist not of the authors.",1128384000,2,174,4.766666666666667
