I'm almost 60 and I was able to catch on quickly. I enjoy it very much. Also, I appreciate that there is diversty in the dancers. As a Black woman, I get tired of hip hop workouts led by and featuring only White women. I want to see myself represented!",1515456000,,390,4.27027027027027
8337431,3,B001R5V2QS,"I'm a big fan of Jeannette Jenkins, and have several of her dvds.  I was somewhat disappointed in this one, but I realize that it might be a matter of personal preference. I am referring to the style that Jeannette uses to teach the dance routine in this workout.  She starts with one step and then keeps building step by step, always repeating and repeating from the beginning.  The good part is that you can easily remember the next step, and Jeannette, being the great instructor that she is, always cues you beforehand.  And, by repeating the moves so many times, your body is getting a good aerobic workout.  However, for my taste, this style of teaching tends to be boring and just too repetitive.  Someone else might love it.  But, I don't think I will be using this dvd very often for that reason.  I admit that had I known this ahead of time, I wouldn't have purchased this dvd.  Sorry, Jeannette, all the other workouts of yours that I have are just terrific!",1498694400,,969,4.491428571428571
8337432,5,B001R5V2QS,"I bought this as something my 9 year old daughter and I could do together. She likes to do workout tapes with me (she's skinny) but often things can be too challenging. This was easy and fun, but we both work up a sweat. If you are a hardcore dancer or need something really intense this isn't for you. It's great for newbies or people who want to take it a little easier.

As always, Love Jeanette!",1483228800,,399,4.181818181818182
8337433,5,B001R5V2QS,"Jeanette is really good at cues and she is so bubbly and fun. You can tell she loves what she's doing and it shows! The backup dancers are a variety of ages (like 9 to 60ish) to show that anyone can dance for fun.  They aren't too hard, but challenging enough not to be too boring.",1474243200,2,281,4.017857142857143
8337434,1,B001R5V2QS,I like a challenging work out like Jillians. I have another Jeanette DVD that is a great work out but this was lame and beginner level. She starts off introducing 15 ppl who are in the video. Nobody cares. The moves are just as lame w music from the 80s. I returned,1449964800,,265,4.115384615384615
8337435,5,B001R5V2QS,This is great.  Such a good workout.  And I love Jeannette's personality.,1407110400,,73,5.0
8337436,4,B001R5V2QS,"This work out is the business.
 I absolutely love this work out it had some tricky foot work but I mastered it.",1403136000,,111,4.045454545454546
8337437,2,B001R5V2QS,Very disappoionted with jeanette on this one.  Love the Hollywood trainer but this is just too concentrated on diva vice her normal exercise routine,1391904000,2,148,5.166666666666667
8337438,5,B001R5V2QS,"I am the type of person that dreads going to the gym. In addition, I have a syndrome that causes my joints to ache making working out even more unenjoyable. I started a weight loss program and I really want to do some type of physical activity to strengthen my body and to prevent flab. I bought the DVD after reading a few reviews. When I received the DVD, I let it sit on the shelf for about 2-3 weeks still thinking that it would be just like any other workout video. When I finally decided to do the workout, I was SUPER surprised. I absolutely love the video. Jeanette makes working out fun and I couldn't believe how fast the workout went. I wear a heart monitor and consistently burn between 370-400 calories every time I do it. I also look forward to working out with the DVD and have found myself doing the workout more and more each week.",1339632000,11,848,4.273291925465839
8337439,5,B001R5V2QS,"I happen to love Jeanette Jenkin's personality, cueing and energy.  In this video I believe she gives a real peak into her true personality which is both funny and warm.  She may be called the Hollywood Trainer but she seems like a fun girlfriend.

In the cardio part of the dvd, Jeanette teaches a complete dance routine of easy movements with names like like ""Clear the dance floor"" ""Own It"" ""Beat it"" ""Stiletto"" and ""Mambo"".

The music in this workout is superb and ranges from ""old school soul"" to spanish guitar, to reggae, to pop. The music does not overpower which I appreciate.

I would say this is an intermdiate-beginner level workout. You will sweat! The 40 minute cardio section is followed by a 20 minute toning section that ends with a cool down stretch.

Very professional production quality. Among the diverse group of students are a 63 year old grandmother, a pregnant mother, a plus size woman, a 5 year old boy and an 11 year old girl.  and they add their own personality to the dance movements.  Everyone has a great time and they add their own personality to the dance movements!

I had to buy it used here on Amazon but it might be available on the author's website.  This is a KEEPER!",1334361600,8,1207,4.546296296296297
