Yes. This is Li Yang,a director who captures the darkest side of China and expose it,but here you can still see that people are not born evil even when are doing evil things...go watch it.",1227744000,4,405,4.71830985915493
3622976,4,B001H5ZQHY,"Bai Xuemei, recently graduated from college, is unwittingly sold, not by her family but by her friends, to a villager deep in the bowels of mountainous rural China ... in the 1990s! This is not a documentary. It's almost a typical horror film pacing through a Texas Chainsaw Massacre style suffocating terror without any blood, but there's psychological and physical abuse, including rape--father and mother hold Bai Xuemei down while her purchaser rapes her. Ouch!

China is a vast expanse and this film's cinematography captures that space wonderfully. Bai Xuemei is so far up in the mountains it is simply too far away for her to run to safety.

Lu Huang who plays Bai Xuemei is the only professional actor in the film. The rest of the cast, from the shopkeeper to the Village Chief, are actual villagers. When the police arrive to make a rescue and the whole village gangs up on them demanding the girl repay the 7,000 they paid for her if she is to return home, it rings with a frightening authenticity. I watched this film feeling that with 5 minutes left to go she would be rescued despite everything suggesting otherwise.

It's not that kind of film. Blind Mountain is an essay on the collision of traditional and contemporary Chinese culture. It's not pedantic, nor is it belittling to the realities of the culture at its source, but it's hard not to see it that way, especially through 21st-century, western eyes. The film does a remarkable job of showing that it's not a matter of simply enforcing contemporary law. It's much deeper and difficult than that.",1224547200,6,1568,4.77859778597786
8307904,5,B001H5ZQHY,This movie will rip out a lot of anger and sadness from you. What an ordeal she had to go through. Amazing.,1465257600,,107,3.909090909090909
8307905,5,B001H5ZQHY,"Clearly this is one of the best movie I have seen in a long time. China it seems is on the same par as Hollywood in the movie making industry. This movie is very intense from beginning to end, even though the ending is somewhat blunt. The environmental country is breathing taking and extremely beautiful. The day to day traditional lifestyle of country living is also captured. This is a movie about human trafficking and shocking are the methods used. If you like Chinese movies or just movies in general, you won't be disappointed viewing this one.",1426636800,,551,4.690721649484536
8307906,5,B001H5ZQHY,"Other than the fact that most kidnapped brides have little education and are more likely to be from North Korea or Burma, the movie is very realistic including the part about threatening the police. In fact in one case a villager killed a policemen that was attempting to free his wife. Also, in some locations, half of all female residents were purchased from human traffickers and a tacit system of neighborhood monitoring exists to prevent victims from escaping. Like in the move, typically the initial trafficker is woman and often a friend or cousin and in most cases they entice the naive and poor young women with offers of employment.

Officially, to look good to the world, China has laws against trafficking of brides and because the truth was unfavorable to China, the movie was edited to makes it appear that China punishes the people that purchase kidnapped brides.  Since the location of the kidnapped brides is well known, it would be easy for China to prevent most trafficking of young women.  Instead China usually punishes the brides if they escape. And, if they are North Korean, they will be arrested by Chinese authorities and deported back to North Korea where they face brutal punishment and, at times, execution.  China almost never punish the purchasers.

China, a Tier 3 country, the lowest possible ranking for fighting human trafficking and along with Uzbekistan is on par with countries such as North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe. China may be the worse country in forced marriage trafficking abuse because they encourage the kidnapping and selling of young women to rural farmers and there are continued indications of local officials' complicity in trafficking. For instance, when a bride was known to be a victim of human trafficking and forced marriage, local officials would still issue a marriage license.

The problem may be excess males. The result of China's one child police and the preference for boys. Sex-selection abortion accounts for almost all the excess males. The result is an epic surplus of bachelors. The unmarried men are often desperate--for companionship, for sex, for household help. In rural areas the bride shortage is exacerbated by young Chinese women's preference for urban life and modern-minded husbands. Young women are fleeing the farm in droves, attracted by well-paying factory jobs and more comfortable urban lifestyles. In the three provinces closest to North Korea, the ratio of young men to young women is a staggering 14 to 1.",1373068800,5,2516,5.079903147699758
8307907,4,B001H5ZQHY,"Human trafficking is a bit too common in China, and other SE Asian countries.  In this film, based on actual events, a young college graduate is conned into travel to a remote province, where she is drugged, and sold as wife.
Not pleasant fare, but a good movie, with some insights into one of the darker sides of China.",1371600000,,320,4.423728813559322
8307908,4,B001H5ZQHY,"""Blind Mountain"" (2007 release from China; 109 min.) brings the story, set in the early 1990s, of a young woman named Bai, a recent college graduate, who thinks she is getting a job opportunity selling medics in Northern China. Instead, she finds herself drugged and abandoned in a remote village, apparently sold for 7,000 RMB to a local family's son. Bai fiercely resists and tries to escape several times, to no avail, and hence remains in a forced 'marriage'. She eventually befriends a local teacher (the only one in the village with some formal education) who falls in love with her and promises to help her to escape. At that point we are about half way into the movie. Will Bai be able to get away from her forced marriage and escape the village? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a devastating family drama, and not one for the faint of heart. At the beginning we see how eventually the entire family (the 'husband' and his parents) subdue Bai by power so that he can fulfill his 'marital obligation'. The despair in Bai is apparent throughout this movie. Second, this movie minces no words or images about the brutality and absurdity of living conditions and arrangements in rurual China. At one point, Bai and a friend are walking by a sign that reads ""More trees and less babies is the road to wealth"", well, of course!

This movie made quite a splash upon its first screening at the 2007 Cannes film festival. It will not surprise you that the movie we (in the free world) get to see is apparently quite a bit different from the version that was released in China (where it had multiple edits, including an alternative, 'happy' ending). All that said, if you are in the mood for a foreign quality movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""Blind Mountain"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1364256000,2,1934,4.652046783625731

8307910,5,B001H5ZQHY,"This movie is one of the most disturbing movie's I've ever seen.
Sort of like some of the Gong Li films but not with her.
It is worth seeing but very hard to imagine that women can be treated like this.",1284768000,,202,3.951219512195122
8307911,3,B001H5ZQHY,"This is a good movie, but it's not what I expected.  It has all the making of a good exploitation movie but it isn't.  the plot is good and the acting is good. It's not low budget. But if your looking for women being exploited then this is not the movie you want. I recommend star of david beauty hunting for exploitation.  This movie is a more of a drama.",1266710400,,356,4.057142857142857
8307912,3,B001H5ZQHY,"This film was excellent for over half its length, until two things happened. One, when she gets caught in a town far from the village, because a bus driver decides that a cigarette is payment enough for allowing a man to board the bus and physically remove someone against their will. Yeah right! Everyone else demands money for any type of help, but the bus driver will take just a cigarette? The fact that he would even stop for a bunch of country yokels who aren't looking to pay for a ride seems unrealistic to begin with. It is a major contrivance that creates a path leading to an ending with no resolution. Which is the second gripe I have. The police have guns but don't use them when being threatened? What?! That is completely counter to the way the Chinese police and country villages have clashed in reality. The villagers are so worried about a visiting inspector giving them a bad report (who cares? it's not like they depend on tourism), but not the government police with guns who are rightfully rescuing a kidnapped girl and who can have them arrested and imprisoned? What the police do at the end will only create more frustration upon the frustration you'll already be feeling at this point of the film. What you'll get for all of your emotionally invested time is nothing, because the writer/director has chosen to not provide you the satisfaction of some type of resolution. I'm not talking about a ""satisfactory"" resolution, I'm talking any kind of resolution. I get what the filmmaker is doing by ending it the way he did, but by going that route it inflicted great damage to the message of the story. It's not a bad movie by any means; it is well written (mostly), directed, acted and the locations were well chosen. So, if you like being frustrated and enjoy yelling at the movie screen, watch this movie. If you prefer something that will provide a sense of accomplishment at the end I suggest looking elsewhere.",1243296000,2,1938,4.636627906976744
8307913,4,B001H5ZQHY,"I'm not sure about the metaphor here, but Blind Mountain surely yields views of Chinese culture which are surprising, brutal, and wondrous.  I came away with a real fascination with the story and its execution on film.
The acting is superb...each character seemed to identify with and play his/her part with creative conviction so that the totality has tremendous authenticity.  Take note of the brutal son and his equally brutal mother who softens only when her new grandson appears.
There are only a few minor inconsistencies..for example, why would a family send their daughter to college (a daughter is still not valued in Chinese society; surely the family had hopes that an education would allow her to rise) and then turn around and 'sell' her in marriage where they would receive so little in return?  And how can law enforcement be so little respected in a society which supposedly respects people in high places?
I wish a Chinese reviewer would comment on the film here. The script seemed sound and it would be nice to know if the translation is too.
The scenery is magnificent and evocative.  A definite 4, bordering on 5 star movie!  This is the way culture-commentary is true art!",1237939200,,1193,4.857142857142857
