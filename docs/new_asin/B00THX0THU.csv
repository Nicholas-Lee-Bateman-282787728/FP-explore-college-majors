8701796,5,B00THX0THU,"My grandchildren watched the VHS tapes over and over again and just loved them.  It is amazing what they learned from them  I bought this for my great-grandchild and she, too, loves it.  She really likes the old tapes, too, because she can play her favorite over and over again.  My favorite, after watching the videos through six grandchildren spread over 20 years is ""The Best Babysitter Ever"".  You gotta love Hilda!",1453420800,,419,4.763888888888889
