3528322,5,B001DDBD36,"This set was especially ordered for three of the four movies, and in particular for ""Prancer"".  The young girl who played Sam Elliot's daughter deserved an Oscar for her performance in this movie.  This story pulls at one's heartstrings, about family, neighbors, community, kindnesses to other, and opening oneself up to friendship and love.  Our family love that movie, but enjoyed ""Miracle on 34th"", ""Home Alone II"" was especially enjoyed by the grandchildren.  Since our family is big on decorating for the holidays, inside and out, a movie about competition in outdoor decorating was enjoyed as well.  Strongly recommend this for good family entertainment.",1390867200,,660,5.3076923076923075

3528326,3,B001DDBD36,"This is basically a good value in a holiday movie box set, each title having its own slimline case but BE WARNED: the disc of the 1947 version of Miracle on 34th Street is the colorized version contained in the 2-disc special edition. I for one am not a fan of messing with original versions of films for marketings' sake. Fox could just have easily inserted the original version disc with all the special features instead of the colorized version. For this reason this product loses two stars.",1228262400,16,494,4.625
