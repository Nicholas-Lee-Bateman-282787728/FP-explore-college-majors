he became one of the top stars today. Street Smart is powerful!!",1471651200,,173,4.2727272727272725

MORGAN FREEMAN is hypnotic in this film STREET SMART and it had extras to boot! Great Product, thanks.",1377734400,,301,4.392857142857143

I knew about Code of Silence -- a minor genre classic. However, Street Smart was new to me and it is a delight. The premise is that Christopher Reeve as a reporter makes up a story about an out-sized destructive pimp. Surprise! Real-life pimp ""Fast Black"" doesn't like it.

I've become so accustomed to seeing Morgan Freeman play dignified, play wise, play cool, that it is revelatory to see him sink his teeth into a full-blown villain.

""Stuck for a story idea that will excite his dismissive editor, New York magazine reporter Christopher Reeve hits on a winner: the life of a Manhattan pimp. The editor eats it up, but there's just one problem: Reeve made the whole thing up and now the editor wants more. What's worse, a scarily charismatic pimp (Morgan Freeman) and his top prostitute come looking for the reporter, believing that he was, in fact, writing about them. As they seduce him with access to their world, he becomes more and more trapped by his lies, particularly when a crusading D.A. also takes an interest in just what he knows. Reeve is the bland nougat center in what is otherwise a very tasty little film, given added crunch by the superlatively seductive Freeman and the equally intriguing Baker.""

""From the director of The Fugitive comes a riveting, turbo-charged crime thriller starring international action star Chuck Norris (""Walker, Texas Ranger""). Exploding with heart-stopping chases and lethal martial arts confrontations, it's a ""daring"" (Washington Post) and ""suspenseful"" (Boxoffice) adventure that pits an honest cop against two vicious crime lordsand his own department. Eddie Cusack (Norris) is a Chicago detective who plays by his own rulesa dangerous habit, especially when he breaks the force's ""code of silence"" to blow the lid off a deadly police cover-up. Now an outcast, he receives little help from his embittered fellow officers when he's hurled into a blistering battle against rival drug kingpins. But Cusack is a one-man army, waging war on the criminals with his razor-sharp wits, lighting-fast karate moves and a special surprise: ""Prowler,"" a remote-controlled, rocket-equipped tank!""",1269734400,2,2157,5.154285714285714
