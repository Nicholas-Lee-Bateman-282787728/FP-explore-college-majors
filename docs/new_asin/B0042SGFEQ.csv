Meet new inmates Janet Dominguez (Deirdre Rubenstein), Pat O'Connell (Monica Maughan), Sharon Gilmour (Margot Knight), Caroline Simpson (Rosalind Speirs), Vivienne Williams (Bernadette Gibson) as well as the return of an infamous inmate causing anguish for one particular member of staff. However her arrival causes initial delight for Vera Bennett (Fiona Spence). Could Vera become Governor Bennett? It seems very likely in this set of episodes.
We say goodbye to Karen Travers (Peta Toppano) and Greg Miller (Barry Quin) in a life or death cliffhanger. It's also Vera's birthday Wentworth style. Shortly after we have our only ever Wentworth Christmas experience with the amusing play which causes much embarrassment to the staff. Doreen (Colette Mann) has the emotional runaround when she discovers her mother (Anne Haddy) has been trying to locate her. We also meet Geoff Butler (Ray Meagher in the first of his three Prisoner roles) who causes anguish for Meg Jackson (Elspeth Ballantyne). Is there a possibility that Lizzie Birdsworth (Sheila Florance) may be released? There are terrorists attempting to break one of their own out of Wentworth. Could this result in the end for our beloved Governor Davidson (Patsy King)? Has Doreen finally found happiness in the arms of Kevin Burns (Ian Gilmour)?
Find out in the third volume of this terrific series. You can also watch the first few scenes involving long - term cast member Betty Bobbitt who played Judy Bryant. Enjoy!",1313366400,,1644,5.138059701492537
