8193478,1,B000PUAIL6,ordinarily i give everything with Miranda otto is in a 5 star but i must admit this is so bad . she shouldn't have accepted this boring junk of a movie even at that age for whatever money she got. this is the only movie with her i couldn't sit through.the story line is pointless-useless and doesn't work. nothing to keep a viewer from hitting that stop or reject. so rent or buy at your own risk.,1435622400,,397,4.1688311688311686
