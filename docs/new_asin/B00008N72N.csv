1853058,5,B00008N72N,"Sholay - the greatest Bollywood film of all time - brought together the acting talents of some of the biggest stars in Bollywood at that time. The two male leads, Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan, were already hugely popular. Amitabh Bhachchan had just made his big breakthrough the previous year (1974) with Zanjeer. Dharmendra was already well established and had starred in the box office smash hit Yaadon Ki Baaraat (a film which sadly doesn't get very many mentions when talking of classics). These two are supported in the film by Sanjeev Kumar, Hema Malini, Jaya Bhaduri and Amjad Khan making his onscreen debut as the menacing villain Gabbar Singh.

The story is about a retired police officer Thakur Baldev Singh (Sangeev Kumar) living in a village that is being terrorised by Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Thakur recruits two small time crooks Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh), whom he had encountered during his work in the force, to capture Gabbar. The film has various other sub-plots including a comedic love story between the funny romantic Veeru and the never-shuts-up local simpleton Basanti (Hema Malini), and a more serious one between Jaidev and widow and Thakur's family member Radha (Jaya Bhaduri).

Even though the film is over 30 years old it still looks fantastic, testament to the fact it used advanced filming technologies way ahead of any other film of it's time.

The dialogue is so memorable that the soundtrack was changed and re-released with additional memorable lines from especially Gabbar Singh and others - the first time this was done in Bollywood.

The acting is truly brilliant with very powerful performances from Sanjeev Kumar, Dharmendra, Amjad Khan and Amitabh Bhachchan (for Amitabh's best ever performance see him in Deewaar - another absolute classic film from the previous year).

This film is to Bollywood what Star Wars is to Hollywood - the greatest film of all time. It set a new standard for others which  has never really been equalled since its opening in August 1975.  It ran for five consecutive years to packed cinema houses in India.

I urge anyone, regardless of colour or creed, to watch this film,  and sample a slice of Bollywood magic.",1121212800,29,2202,5.010958904109589

sholay grossed 35 crores in its first run,an unimagiable amount at that time.in its rerun in 80s it doubled its previous distributer price.its tickets were priceless,where other hit films tickets were blacked for 15-20 rs,it crossed 100rupees mark quite easily to an willing audience who were ready to pay the sum.
the story is about a police inspector whose family gets masacred by a dacoit,the dreaded GABBAR.he hires two crooks JAI ,VEERu to catch GABBAR alive for him.like VEERU tells in one of the popular dialogues of the film,the story contains emotion,comedy,drama,tragedy all in all.probably world cinema's only character SAMBHA ,is the only character to be immortalised by only one line""poorey pachas hazar"".

The print supposedly is 'digitally remastered' but both the picture quality and sound is sub standard. It is a shame that in this day and age we are deprived of movies that deserve Blu Ray treatment.

1853067,5,B00008N72N,"Unarguably, no other movie has imprinted itself upon the Indian collective consciousness as Sholay has, and deservedly so.  It is, in one word, flawless*; the dialogues, the cast, the acting, the music, the background score and its technical aspects are all superlative and have firmly stood the test of time.

The insinuated brutality of certain scenes (shooting the grandson, hacking off arms) is handled sensitively, by seamless transitions onto their consequential aftermaths or symbolic sights and sounds rather than by splashing bloodshed across the screen.

It is a spectacle, I believe, that perhaps can only be rivaled in scope and magnificence should someone be enterprising enough to tackle the very fertile narrative of the Mahabharata into an equally eloquent and polished movie production.

* Disclaimer for animal lovers and those who believe animals ought to be treated with the respect and care: I cringe with despair during a comedic scene involving a bird and a majority of action sequences involving horses, there is more than one scene in which horses are tripped - I can only hope animal welfare was the topmost concern and that they weren't hurt, however, it is impossible to know that for certain.",1434844800,,1221,5.182741116751269

1853070,2,B00008N72N,"The words ""NEW DIGITAL RE-MASTER"" are just gimmicky terms. Mean nothing in the Indian home video industry!
Like any other version of the film, this is an uncleaned, ""non"" re-mastered transfer. I would rank it among the poorest quality editions of the movie. Ideally they should have taken a cleaned up print to master their DVD, then perhaps the tag would've held some meaning.

The video quality is not very good. It has a lot of dirt, scratches and wear-and-tear. But overall, is pretty colorful and clarity is average. Nowhere close to an excellent transfer.

The audio quality is terrible, its mono 5.0 (opposed to ""Enhanced Digital 5.1"" mentioned at the back.) Clarity is awful, and there's a lot of distortion. Won't even give the audio half a star.
There was a version that had very good 5.1 audio (mastered from the original 6 track audio source). There's a lot of difference in the two versions.

In short, this version is no better than any other one. Don't fall for the terms on the cover saying ""NEW DIGITALLY RE-MASTERED"".

If you really need to see this film in great quality, order a version from amazon.fr which is presented in an anamorphic frame. The audio is mono (1.0) and is very clean.

1853071,5,B00008N72N,"Sholay is an epic for the era in which it was released and till today. I don't think an American who doesn't get the language can accurately critique the movie. Each character was carefully embedded in the movie, with its dialogs and peculiarities.
For those of us who remember this movie, remember each dialog, song, moves etc. Not just that, it was ahead of its times in its social message and theme.
None had been presented this way.
Even today, not many writers focus so much on each character of the movie and pull it all together. When done this way, it no wonder is a hit and an epic.",1420243200,2,591,4.381818181818182

1853097,5,B00008N72N,"I saw this movie 30 years ago in the cinema. It was a couple of years after it was released. Its most memorable moments are its dialog in the Hindi language, and that too relative to its time in the mid 1970s, moslty credited to the late actor Mr. Khan.

In so far as comparing it to American movies which I also watched enthusiastically then, I was highly impressed by Sholay movie's dialog in comparison. From a western point of view with regards to the action scenes, the Hindustan Government censorship board had strict censorship on action scenes. Even so, the final product was not lack lustrous due to the action scenes, of which some are memorable to this day.

The songs and dances carried the movie further out of the cinema's boundary, in comparison to most my American movie experience - faithfully.",1398211200,,811,4.664335664335664
1853098,4,B00008N72N,"There is a lot of confusion and misinformation in the reviews on this page so, before I review the film, which I watched last night, a few facts.  The EROS DVD version of the film is 204 minutes long with a standard 4:3 aspect ratio.  There are some flaws in the print, and some in the original filming.  The worst flaw in the print is a ragged vertical line on several minutes of film.  In the original film, there are several cases where objects intrude on the screen, such as a hand holding up the stolen motorbike in one shot.  But neither is bad enough to spoil the viewer's experience.  The print is certainly not ""awful"" as one reviewer said.

According to Wikipedia, what we are seeing on the EROS DVD is what was originally filmed.  To make the film appear to be wide screen, without the expense of widescreen cameras, the tops and bottoms were cut off the frames for the theatrical release.  Also according to Wikipedia, the censorship board cut quite a lot of violence from the original, making it a much less powerful movie.  The EROS DVD is the ""director's cut"" with the violence intact.

Now, how did I like the movie.  It's ok, but it's no Star Wars.  The dialog in the Russian ""Eastern"" ""White Sun of the Desert"" is better.

For me, the comedy fell absolutely flat, especially the endless ""humor"" about a woman who talks too much.  The Charlie Chaplin pastiche by the prison guard was mildly amusing, but not really funny.

The action is good, but not great.  It held my interest.

The acting is very good, especially the charm of the two main characters.

What I liked best was the music.  The song and dance numbers always brought a smile to my face.",1395705600,,1668,4.4784053156146175

I have always loved this movie but I thought I got this love by watching it again and again as a child because my grandfather was a big Amitabh Bachchan fan! In fact I have watched all Amitabh's classic innumerable times when I was young. I have always wanted my kids to watch those movies that I used to love but they r so busy with countless distraction that this generation is blessed ( or maybe cursed) with, they never showed interest in watching boring old movies!
This summer vacation I made a pact with them that I would make them watch my old favourites. And so far they have loved all of Them.'Sholay' and ' Seeta and Geeta' being their most favourites!
The dialogues of this movie are still being used in new movies. So kids were familiar with most polpular ones!

While I can follow the plot fairly well, the lack of proper translations for the songs and the reformating of the image is too great a compromise. Since Ramesh Sippy is still alive and well, he should be given the green light to supervise the new HD restoration. That means returning scenes that were cut, unpacking the original six-channel stereo soundtrack and mapping it to Dolby 6.1 or 5.1 (as well as a AC3 2.0 soundtrack), gathering any material that would make solid bonus features, and of course, creating a brand-new, proper subtitle stream that includes all dialogues and lyrics.

It's complicated.  You see, Sholay is a masala masterpiece, which means it includes everything you've ever thought of in a movie:  romance, cultural commentary, comedy, action, drama.  It's a buddy movie, and an action movie, and a love story, and a classic tragedy, and just about anything else you've seen in film but all in one amazing package.  It would take nearly three hours for me to even scratch the surface of the many layers of the plot.

It tells the story of two friends Veeru (Dharamendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bacchan), a couple of small time thieves and con men who are hired by Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kapoor), an ex-police officer and village elder, to rid his village Ramgarh, of the dreaded Gabbar Singh, a bandit and a wanted dacoit (an Indian robber).

Its one of the few films that everything came together, the songs, the acting, story, comedy (who can forget Dharamendra's drunken diatribe atop the water tower when denied marriage to Basanti (the gorgeous Hema Malini) but the difference was that for the first time, a villain was more appreciated than the heroes! Gabbar Singh was the ultimate villain ever, the very mention of his name would be used as a threat to ensure children behave themselves.

Theatrically screened in 1975, it is timeless... not even for once you feel that there's anything dated, everything looks contemporary - and this is no mean achievement!

Every single character is etched out optimally and you remember ALL of them after the movie. Howzzat!

The music is memorable, it complements and enhances the myriad of moods and sequences and emotions and drama in Sholay (Embers) - whether it's the terror and ruthlesslessness of the villain, the dacoit Gabbar; the unspoken romance between one of the two heroes Jai and the widow Radha; the flirtation between the other hero Veeru and the ""tangewaali"" (coach driver) Basanti; the angst, lionheartedness and the bravery of Thakur, a landlord and an ex-police officer who recruits Jai and Veeru, two small-time crooks, to capture Gabbar (for avenging his family's massacre); the extraordinary chase sequences; the wonderful start and the awe-inspiring end.

The continuity is amazing and so is the editing. A rock near a bridge shown in the beginning is there at the end too. As for editing, the best example is when Gabbar strikes down swords on Thakur's arms (who's tied between two pillars) but the actual hits are never shown, instead, as soon as the swords come down, immediately a shot of Thakur recalling this incident is shown and for the first time his shawl has fallen down and the wind is flapping his armless shirt-sleeves... it is first-rate!

There is also tremendous folklore and near-mythology associated with this movie - the so many versions, the significantly different endings, the struggle to get this made and released...

Amazon at this page seem to be selling a Region-1 coded release from Qualiton Imports. My question to all other reviewers and anyone owning this exact edition (Qualiton Imports, Region 1) is what is the runtime of this movie and whether this is the one in which the fearsome antagonist Gabbar dies...? Is it 204 minutes long or is it really 4-and-a-half hours long as one reviewer has put it? Is it presented in fullframe or widescreen format? Is it really coded Region 1? Please answer keeping in mind that my questions are about the Qualiton Imports edition adverstised here by Amazon.",1127865600,17,2376,4.98989898989899
