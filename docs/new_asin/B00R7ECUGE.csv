6901588,3,B00R7ECUGE,"First let me say the subtitled version of this anime is in the top three of the year.  Where I had an issue was the voice acting in the dubbed version.  Normally funimation has really good voice acting on dubs.  On this blue ray ""The acting is bloody rubbish, guv'ner"". The accents are horrid, and the actors seem to slip between barely English accents to heavy Geordie.  The voice actor for YaYa is totally wrong and totally lacking in the bubbly cuteness of the Japanese version, the actor for Rissen lacks the grim determination of the Japanese actor.  The translations have changed from the subtitled, in ways that ruin some of the dialog,  One example is YaYa in the Japanese version makes statements which are technically true, but which give people the wrong impression.  In the English version she says things which are untrue,  but Rissen's counter dialog isn't modified as much so there is a mismatch.  In some cases Rissen's dialog was changed to dialog that is, in my opinion, not as snappy or funny as in the original.

So, if you want a subtitled version then this is a great buy and you'll be happy.  However if you want it for the dub version, you probably be disappointed.",1424390400,9,1189,4.614285714285714
6901589,5,B00R7ECUGE,"I saw the first 2 episodes and I got attached to it because it had action on it, plus fantasy so you could say that's mine kind of anime and from thier on the rest of the episodes gets even better.",1424217600,2,197,3.8292682926829267
6901590,5,B00R7ECUGE,"Unbreakable Machine Doll Is my # 1 pick of the year. I read the Manga first and the anime stayed true to the script. Set in the turn of the 20th century, the Victorian era to be exact in jolly old England. Now if you have read the manga then you will be slightly let down because they never finished the story. This is all to common because if goes beyound 13 but less than 24 they cut it short. So our hero Raishin Akabane and his and by the way most powerful automation Yaya have come to the Walpurgis Royal Academy. Having come from Japan for revenge, it seems that his older brother may have killed all of his Family which are gifted puppeteers. Raishin on the other hand showed little ability early on but as time goes on become very good at magic and Shoko the inventor of Yaya loans Yaya to him so that he may get into the Academy to do her spying for the Japanese government solve some very strange crimes.
The art work is fantastic and the storyline is very believable in fact it fits very well. the closing song is delightful to say the least it had me laughing. Really I went and bought the Japanese copy because I liked it so much ( I speak Japanese). If you haven't seen this yet than do yourself a favor and take a look I think you will fall in love with it too.",1423180800,21,1276,4.128514056224899

6901616,4,B00R7ECUGE,"Good stuff. Steampunk England, but more focused on magical dolls, a series that layers in the backstory, background, and plot pretty well. It rushes breathlessly forward, with highly detailed fights, jump cuts, and frenetic pacing. Like, the main character protects his doll, jump back to a flashback where he did it in the past, in he goes for an operation,  and he's back on his feet to save the day again. In the meantime,  others are fighting, conspiracy is afoot, and the world order is in danger of collapsing. Exposition is refreshingly brief, with only just enough explained - visuals serve instead. I like it. The characters are pretty stock, but the main guy is actually pretty fascinating; I'll buy the manga to see if there's more to him. The anime starts collecting girls, bit it doesn't feel like a harem anime. Though, it doesn't miss a chance for some fanservice either. But it is only just one more thing added to the headlong rush that drives the series. It does lose instant classic status for being just a bit too loose. For example, it's primarily set in a British school for these magical engineers, but there are few rules or adults truly interacting with the main characters - think about Hogwarts without strong professors or rules about magic. And the levity feels pretty awkward, though it helps contrast against the pace. The adults mostly watch, stepping in only as necessary. It's a bizarre, hands off approach, but does keep the action focused where it should be, the teens. I rather like the multi-episode stories, too. Good animation that is consistently making good decisions - more detailed for battles and emotions, less so for shadowy talking. Good Japanese voice acting, with good dialogue, even if the translation is markedly different at times. Would enjoy another series.",1490313600,4,1812,4.9183006535947715

6901621,2,B00R7ECUGE,"Before I say anything, which won't be much considering my complaints with the show, I turn your attention to the very helpful reviews posted by Andrew Smith and arkham618. These two said literally everything I was thinking after watching the series so if you can glean anything from this show, I would highly advise reading their reviews seriously.

I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan of anime, and too my credit I have only watched a sizable handful, but I know the essentials to making a good show. I have never regret purchasing a TV show, considering I spent the money so I have to deal with it, but if I were to pick one show that violated this thought process, it would be Unbreakable Machine Doll. To it's credit the show isn't necessarily bad, but it does what most MAD HOUSE production animes have done which is that it feels more like a promotional anime than a complete adaptation. Not to say those are bad; in fact Overlord, No Game No Life, and Berserk are all fantastic shows and I would highly recommend any of those in comparison to this. Anyway, even if that was the goal with this anime that would be the only redeeming value I can see this show having. The point of a promotional anime is to make a handful of episodes adapted from the original source material that give great insight into what the show is and how it's going to play out. Typically these shows end with massive cliffhangers in hopes of drawing the audience's attention to the original source material to finish the series if they so desire while still making the series worth watching. So even if that was the goal behind Unbreakable Machine Doll, it still falls flat in every field possible in trying to be an accurate adaptation.

The first few episodes are actually pretty good I'll give it that, the premise is intriguing with small hints of originality and the [main] characters are fairly likable, or as likable as common anime tropes are but that's not a negative I have with the show. I won't spoil anything for reasons I'll give later, but the moment in the show where all the attention is drawn away from the main character and placed solely on one of the main side characters is where I have some major complaints. First and foremost the central premise that I previously mentioned was part of the shows charm is completely abandoned and you're thrown into, what seems to be, a completely unrelated event timeline that spans the rest of the show. If you're going to put as much time and effort as you did into the story of the first few episodes, why squander it so early on because it only gets worse from there. The show then switches roles and the main character is still precieved as the main character while the central story is entirely focused around a side character. While again this isn't necessarily a bad thing and in fact can be made into an intriguing plot devise, this show does quite the opposite. Multiple side characters are then thrown into the mix and last multiple episodes because of their ""importance"" but have little to no actual ""character"" other than just being plot convenient, which is a great sin when making watchable programs. The problem is that it doesn't end there.

My second complaint would have to be that once the central storyline changes past the first few episodes, unless you've read the original source material you will have no idea what's going on. Unexplained character importance, overly mysterious villains and pseudo-villains, cryptic abilities certain characters posses (at plot convenient times no less but never to be used again), and somehow among all the main character role switches the central hero always seems to be the original protagonist who, in most scenes/episodes has nothing to do with any character or scene and yet is there regardless. Forcing the original protagonist to forget his original goal of life in your show and carry the burden of countless side characters (who get more screen time than actual dialogue and importance combined) including his own machine doll (who was a lovable character with some story depth) who just becomes a latent excuse for fan service and to harass every character in the show including the original protagonist, she just turns into an annoying child and you almost despise when she's on screen, does not make for an enjoyable or every watchable show. I did finish it just see if there was any redeeming value and if any of the events that lead up to the cliffhanger finale actually made any sense, but for every inevitably continuous minute this show marched on was another clueless mess of time unfortunately wasted.

Now in all honesty I highly dislike this show but I gave it two stars because it's not all bad. The first few episodes were really quite good and I still enjoy the idea behind the original premise, so I'd say stream the first few episodes and if you're not completely lost in every second that passes than continue it. You may find something worth watching in this show, but don't impulse buy it. Because when you find out that you spent actual money on this and you have the reaction I did, you will regret it. It takes the sole problem that Hyperdimension Neptunia had and scaled it ten fold. That being said it may actually be a good show for those who have read the original source material and can understand what's actually going on, but I could honestly never pick up a copy of the manga because of how disappointed I was in this adaptation alone. This ends my review that will probably be read by no one and those that do find themselves reading it will find every reason to be triggered at every word I've typed and explain how Unbreakable Machine Doll is the greatest anime of all time. That being said I'll leave with this: stream the first six episodes, if you like it then finish it and consider buying it afterwards but don't let something like stylized animation and majority high reviews be taken to heart because you should only really listen to your own opinion and not write reviews for shows that aren't even worth a second of your time.",1472428800,,6078,4.661696178937558

6901623,4,B00R7ECUGE,I would like all seasons or none.,1462665600,,33,3.857142857142857
6901624,5,B00R7ECUGE,"Finally, a show I bought based on the reviews lives up to expectations. The storyline
is sort of Infinite Stratos meets Gunslinger Girls. The students here have automatons
instead of mechanical suits as in I.S., but the idea is similar: they fight with powers
enhanced by the student's magical abilities. And like G.G., the automatons which are
treated with kindness and respect develop personalities, and even the ability to act
independently. Of course this last is a two-edged sword for the protagonist, whose
automaton introduces herself to everyone as Raishin's wife, and acts like a jealous
female. This is the source of most of the humor in what is otherwise a fairly dark story.
It is extremely well done. Raishin treats ""her"" with the same kind of amused exasperation
as Misaka of A Certain Scientific Railgun treats Kuroko--and with as little success.
All the supporting characters are well done and believable, too.
The one complaint that can be leveled is the same as for any 12- or 13-episode series:
by the time all the characters are introduced and a little back story given, the series is
wrapping itself up. UMD desperately needs another season or two.
Though your kids would enjoy this series as well, parental guidance is warranted, as there
is a little android nudity included, and some mild sexual innuendo.",1462320000,6,1328,4.986486486486487

6901629,2,B00R7ECUGE,"One of the more preposterous animes I've seen. The threadbare plot consists of little more than a series of pet monster fights interspersed with inane adolescent bickering, some cursory investigative interludes, and copious fan service from the female characters. Non sequiturs abound, with characters and plot elements introduced without preamble and treated as self-evident fixtures of the setting. (The magic underpinning automatons is especially poorly handled. There's little effort to establish the ground rules at the start of the series, and the protagonist's clever exploits only become evident after the fact, in the expository dialogue of bystanders trying to parse his actions.) Although the protagonist is mildly interesting, many of the supporting characters are downright obnoxious, with the females in particular seeming to be plagued by neuroses in inverse proportion to their bust size. (The most buxom girl is actually the most likeable, in a mousy sort of way.) Finally, the series ends with the central conflict -- the protagonist's mission of revenge against the villain who murdered his family -- not only unresolved, but barely addressed amid all the distractions posed by lesser antagonists.",1453420800,8,1216,5.578378378378378

6901633,5,B00R7ECUGE,"Unbreakable Machine Doll is definitely one of my favorite shows. It is a beautiful show with an outstanding art design that really stands out among the crowd. As an attribute of this, it also has a mix of 3D animation thrown into the fight scenes that really blend well with the setting of the show.

This show takes place in the UK and the dub knows it. Every character has an English accent aside from the few Japanese characters who were given all decidedly given American accents, and this alone makes this dub worth hearing. If you listen to Funimation dubs often, this is not just another one where you will recognize every voice. I personally feel there's no need to mention the Japanese track, but I'm sure you sub only guys will love it.

The animation itself is nice and the show has some great lighting effects. The studio behind UMD is a fairly new studio that doesn't have all that many works under their belt, but they know what they're doing with more unique art styles and the ocassional mix of 3D. Honestly, I'm not sure how this show's budget was balanced, but this show definitely doesn't look like it's lacking.

This show is a basic revenge story, harem builder, but the special attributes of the art and audio track make it something really worthwhile. If you don't mind the sometimes lacking female characters and their over focus on their ""attributes"", then you will love this show. Seriously, give it a shot",1444608000,8,1432,4.6299212598425195

Also refreshing were the mini-story arcs, which had a beginning and a conclusion that could be seen in an evenings watching, As usual, there are plots withing plots, the bevy of girls with issues he must help, and a few side characters that provide some entertaining moments.

Although there is fan service, most of it is the ""Doll"" Yaya trying to seduce Raishin. And Raishin is neither a complete blockhead dweeb nor a goofy perv in the usual anime trope, but a fairly normal guy. It makes the fan service a funny gag, like the cat that always hops into your lap whenever you sit down.",1426550400,16,783,4.7153284671532845
6901657,3,B00R7ECUGE,"While I have to confess I don't own the series I have seen all of it and was less than impressed.  The character are complex and likable, but the plot doesn't deliver.  It seems like lots of time is spent on subplots and the introduction of new characters, but in the end very little is accomplished, and too many questions are left unanswered. Perhaps a second season would improve the overall series, but as a stand alone the first season is very disappointing.
The OVA's included with the series that seem to be a big selling point are only about 4 min long each, once the credits are cut out, and don't amount to much more that a couple of topless shots of the female characters.",1426464000,9,683,4.412698412698413

8694400,4,B00R7ECUGE,"Unbreakable Machine-Doll is one of the oddest mixtures Ive ever seen in anime (and Ive seen a lot of weird stuff in anime!).  On the one hand this is one of the biggest, most hilarious screwball comedies Ive ever seen as the dedicated, honorable Raishin Akabane manages to assemble one of the most manic, mixed up, and misguided harems in anime history.  On the other hand this is one of the most gruesome series of adventures Ive ever waded through: a serial killer (or killers), a monstrously evil misuse of dogs and children, and a byzantine conspiracy of assassination and God knows what else.  But don't forget to laugh!

Raishin Akabane has come to pre-WWI England from Japan, accompanied by his beautiful automaton, Yaya, in order to enroll in the prestigious Walpurgis Royal Academy to study Machinart: a dangerous blend of magic and technology, but thats just the cover story.  He has really come to England in order to kill someone.  You won't believe who, you won't believe why, you won't believe how, you won't believe his undercover side job, and you won't believe the price he is abjectly willing to pay; however, along the way Raishin, who is chock full of unusual ideas when compared with his mostly British fellow students, keeps running into a problem.  Whenever he sees a young lady in trouble, he just has to help, even if she believes (and thanks to Yaya she usually does) that hes a complete pervert.  He also acquires an advisor, who thinks hes a blithering idiot, and a male friend, who regularly states his intention to kill him eventually.  Starting to see the pattern yet?

This story is told in shimmeringly beautiful animation, a considerable portion of which is very well done computer animation, and contains 12 standard episodes and 6 shorter OVA episodes.  Defects?  The story isn't even CLOSE to being finished, and it doesnt help that the third of the three, four episode stories is more confusing than the rest!  Clearly, at least one more season would be REQUIRED in order to have any closure, and given the premise, Im not sure anything short of the final battle would be satisfactory; however, for while it lasts its a hell of a ride.

Note: No surprise at this point, but the typical anime nudity problem is more messed up than usual here.  On the one hand female breasts get bared in every single episode (even in the credits!), and you will just have to face the situation.  On the other hand is the nude female corpse you get to see in loving detail.  Wont be forgetting that one for a while.  Really NOT for children can I say?

Note: Inspired by the lovingly detailed descriptions of the various English origins of most of the characters, the voice actors have made an effort that would please (or infuriate?) Henry Higgins of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Fair-Lady/dp/B00NN78PKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Fair Lady</a>, by carefully giving the proper English accent to each character.  The result?  Well, while as usual, especially with a complicated, unfinished story like this one, the Japanese with English subtitles makes the most sense, the Voice acting track with all the proper accents is something to behold!",1524614400,,3215,4.98314606741573
