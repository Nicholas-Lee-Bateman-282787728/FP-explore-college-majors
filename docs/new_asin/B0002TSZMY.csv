8031690,4,B0002TSZMY,"Real things have happened, not too long ago, in world history that can teach us that human imagination, incorporating wisdom and a love of preserving beauty in life, is an important tool for survival.

always chatted but never became aquainted.  One day, I realized I had not

seen her for awhile, so I went to her home, a couple blocks away.  She

had fallen and no longer able to take her walks.  I began to visit this

elderly couple and one day learned that she and her family had been in an

Indonesian prison camp during World War II.

I was stunned to learn that this amazing person had an amazing story.

I immediately ordered the book and the film.",1167955200,12,530,4.148514851485149
