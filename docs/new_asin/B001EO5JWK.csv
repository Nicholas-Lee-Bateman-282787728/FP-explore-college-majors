8299017,5,B001EO5JWK,"This DVD provides an introduction to key Arnis (sometimes called Kali or Escrima) techniques involving empty hand and the whip. The format is very clean and there are jumps that allow you to go to different techniques easily to make review a snap. This DVD was clearly made to present the information with a minimum of superfluous material, just the thing for an introductory DVD. Master Valdes is interesting and clearly knows his stuff. Anyone interested in these techniques should also look at the second DVD in the series which also deal with Arnis.",1224547200,2,553,4.8936170212765955
8299018,5,B001EO5JWK,"I have attended North Austin Tae Kwon Do Seminars that have featured Mr. Valdez, and his mastery of whips, knives, escrima and hand-to-hand techniques are mesmerizing and informative.  Aside from the self defense value these techniques provide, Mr. Valdez provides detailed instruction on how to best utilize these techniques for both offensive and defensive use.  You will not likely find this quality of instruction anywhere else.",1223856000,2,432,5.53030303030303
8299019,5,B001EO5JWK,"These DVD's are great.  Guru Valdes shows dozens of techniques in a clean and simple format from many angles.  I'd recommend this DVD to any stylist who wants to learn more about Joint Locks, Chokes, Knives and other weapons.  Hard style TKD and Karate stylists will be able derive many techniques to add to their self-defense curricula.",1222905600,3,337,4.87719298245614
