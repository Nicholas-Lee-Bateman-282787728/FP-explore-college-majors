2411656,5,B000BBOUUO,"I have successfully purchased all seasons of Full House for my family.  We LOVE them.  When we have nights where there is nothing on television (which is quite often), we load these up and watch them in order.  It's been really fun watching the Full House family grow up before our eyes.  Plus, I never realized there were so many ""nice"" moments and moral lessons for the kids.  So much better than some of the stuff on tv now.  We are actually all enjoying them!",1275350400,,463,4.3882352941176475

2411660,5,B000BBOUUO,"I love this show and was very disappointed when I couldn't watch all of season 2. I received two replacements and they were all bad. I hope the DVD company can get good, new ones made soon. It's a great show.",1151625600,,208,4.097560975609756
2411661,5,B000BBOUUO,"The shows are exactly the same as those shown on TV of course, but the extras were both interesting and entertaining.

2411699,4,B000BBOUUO,"What ever happened to....
TV that you could watch in front of your children without having to worry they will hear something you aren't ready to explain to them?
TV shows that were enjoyed by the entire family?
I bought this series because my 3 and 6 year olds discovered the Olsen twins recently. They have actually fallen in love with Stephanie.
