5554562,5,B00B4EHE4G,I had been away from yoga practice for too many years and felt nervous and insecure about reentry. This DVD was just perfect. So gentle and rejuvenating. Jurian's warmth is really encouraging. (And her voice is beautiful!) I am so grateful.,1392940800,2,240,4.878048780487805
5554563,4,B00B4EHE4G,"This DVD is a good place to start with a
Gentle Yoga practice.  It is very easy and slow moving.  I like the Kripalu style because it is very body oriented and noncompetitive..",1381795200,4,176,4.303030303030303
5554564,5,B00B4EHE4G,"I spent some time at Kripalu this spring and had the pleasure of taking two classes with Jurian.  I wanted to experience her style of teaching again at home so I purchased the DVD.  It does not disappoint.  It is gentle, but also has a dynamic flow.  It is not, ""lie on the floor"" yoga.  It is great for all fitness levels and you feel stretched out and rejuvenated after this class.",1374451200,10,383,4.263888888888889
5554565,5,B00B4EHE4G,"I loved this practice! It is deep and rich, beautifully paced and languaged. Great for yogis of any level of experience. It's perfect for days when I simply want to luxuriate in my personal yoga practice. The voice-over technique and the simplicity of the setting allowed me to draw my focus inward and to remain present without distraction. In the ever expanding world of the business of yoga, this DVD stands out as a reminder to me of what yoga is about.",1371081600,9,457,4.585365853658536
5554566,5,B00B4EHE4G,"I have been watching ""Gentle Yoga"" DVD in the AM and love it so much.
My compliments on this work.  It is soooo beautifully written, staged, filmed and performed; truly a work of art and a wonderful, pleasurable addition to my life. The music is just perfect for the work.  It is so soothingly done that I hardly notice how hard I am working.  It is just the right length for that morning practice.",1369699200,9,398,4.351351351351352
8562229,5,B00B4EHE4G,"We have purchased multiple copies over the years as this is one of the best yoga instructional DVDs we've encountered. Jurian's human and compassionate style makes yoga approachable for us, and doesn't feel competitive and we don't feel bad about ourselves when we aren't ""perfect"" or up to someone else's standard or body ability. This instruction allows us to focus on our own bodies, movement and form while allowing for mediation and compassion during the poses. Yay!!",1527724800,,472,5.142857142857143
8562230,5,B00B4EHE4G,"Ms. Hughes Kripalu Yoga is almost as good as our Kripalu trained teacher.  Good, familiar Yoga routines.",1510876800,,104,5.117647058823529
8562231,4,B00B4EHE4G,"Jurian is awesome and I adore her. I've taken many workshops and classes from her. She always presents many options and encourages you to listen to what you need, a hallmark of Kripalu yoga. However, the price being charged for this this video is too high. Purchase it from her website instead.",1504915200,,294,4.673076923076923
8562232,5,B00B4EHE4G,I love this DVD! I am 63 and exercise regularly and I take a yoga class that is more challenging once a week. I wanted a yoga that was more restorative and this is perfect fora  Sunday morning me time.,1485993600,,201,4.025
8562233,3,B00B4EHE4G,"Nice music, good voicing, very slow, not difficult. A mind-body practice that requires concentration but moves far too slowly for me. I have a on and off again relationship with mindfulness and yoga. Even when I'm most committed this DVD drags. Watching it fast forward while fiddling with the controls really drove home that the video was slow and it wasn't just a short attention span.",1451606400,,387,4.878787878787879
8562234,4,B00B4EHE4G,"relaxing, mellow, easy to follow.",1417996800,,33,5.8
8562235,5,B00B4EHE4G,I love this DVD. It is now my favorite one. Beautiful flowing movements that slowly awaken the body. I'm going to do a session today.,1398384000,3,133,4.36
8562236,5,B00B4EHE4G,"Jurian's guidance and professional manner makes this a ""must get"" DVD. The flow is seamless and gentle. Its beautifully done and is great for beginners and seasoned yogi's. At the end of the class I felt the calm balance I feel when I am in Jurian's class at Kripalu.  This DVD is truly beautiful and I highly recommend it.",1398384000,2,323,4.47457627118644
8562237,5,B00B4EHE4G,Since  my trip to Kripalu a few years ago I have been wanting to have that kind of yoga experience on a regular basis.  This dvd gives me exactly what I was looking for and I love having the Kripalu feel in my living room.  Great buy!,1395619200,2,234,3.9361702127659575
8562238,5,B00B4EHE4G,"I have many DVD workouts including some yoga workouts. I lean towards more of workout yoga as opposed to one leaning towards spiritual or relaxing yoga. That being said I find this DVD to be a nice alternative, a chance to have a purely relaxing workout. And having done the same movements in many workouts, there are some nice variations. It's beautifully shot and narrated with adjustments for all levels.",1393286400,2,407,4.828571428571428
