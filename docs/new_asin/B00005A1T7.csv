This is just a technical review. And truly: it's a unique DVD.

It must have taken a very thorough preparation to produce a DVD with an image quality as low as this one. All shadows are a muddy kind of black without any detail visible and all highlights are just completely  white, again no detail visible.

And for those of us who love the incomparable Raquel: her flawless skin comes in two colors, magenta and green.

Yes, the company that has put this DVD on the market has succeeded in eliminating skin-tones! Applause!",1109116800,12,590,4.580952380952381
