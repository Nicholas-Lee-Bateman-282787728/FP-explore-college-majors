1390797,4,B000053V6O,"This video is a wonderful update to my collection.  Minna Lessing is down to earth, easy to follow and is a good example of strength and beauty.  No annoying or distracting cheerleading, just an overall great workout.  You almost feel like you are right in the aerobics studio with her.  This tape works your lower body completely.  As an ex fitness instructor, I found her workout to be challenging, yet easy enough to follow, even for beginners.  No fancy moves here!  The circuits make the time fly by, and you'll find yourself begging for more.  The 15 minute fat blaster at the end isn't the greatest toning routine, but it is effective.  I would definitely recommend a mat, as some of the upper body toning is done on the knees.  This one tape has replaced about three of my Denise Austin workouts.  I look forward to more releases from Minna.",998092800,4,849,4.593333333333334
1390798,4,B000053V6O,"I was very pleased with this tape. I recently purchased Minna's Emergency Workout and that one was good but this tape really makes you work. It is not very long, only 35min or so. But the workout is very challenging. I have done all the tapes, from the firm, to Taebo Advanced to Advanced Stott Pilates,etc. I must say I have bought too many tapes and unfortunately they are not always difficult. Well this one was an excellent workout and I would definitly recommend it.",995932800,6,471,4.552941176470588
1390799,4,B000053V6O,"I liked this video because it moved along at a good pace but wasn't overly difficult to follow.  I don't think I'll get bored with it too quickly.  Plus I liked the moves.  They were different enough to be challenging, not so much that I couldn't follow them the first time.  I liked Minna's style also.  I agree the music is nothing to rave about, and the background/production could have been improved.  But these are secondary to the workout itself which I liked a lot.",988416000,2,472,4.4941176470588236
1390800,4,B000053V6O,"This tape is really good, I mean I worked up a major sweat and I felt the burn for hours afterward. I couldn't walk the next day I was soooo sore! But even though I am praising it, this workout does have a couple of drawbacks but not so bad to make it not worth 4 stars. Number 1 there is no one to show you how to do a lower impact or easier workout if you are a beginner. She does tell a few times how to do it slower but she doesn't show you so you don't know if you are dong it right. Also this tape is mostly jumping and bouncing so if you have weak knees don't get this tape!! This workout is not for everyone so if you can find it for rent I would suggest doing that first..also be prepared to watch it a few times because it is very fast paced and none of the movements are really well demonstrated..all in all it's a good workout and I really enjoyed it!!!",980985600,9,865,3.865168539325843
1390811,5,B000053V6O,"This video really works. I have never loved a workout video, but i do this video three times a week and i enjoy it every time. When i first watched it, the first thing that came to mind was that i would not need fitness to do this....i would need courage to even attempt the first 10 minutes! your legs WILL burn and your heart WILL beat hard and if you don't break a sweat then your not human. This workout will not dissapoint.",1111017600,,428,4.107142857142857
1390812,4,B000053V6O,"If you like the workout that you would get at a gym, but just don't have time to get there, this is the workout for you! I feel as though the cardio section gets my heart rate going as much as it would if I were running. Not only are you getting your heart rate up and sweating off calories, you're toning at the same time. Minna is a great instructor too! She is qualified, upbeat, and down to earth, but not annoying in the least. I won't lie, though. I'm an active person, and my first workout with Minna was tough!
DRAWBACKS:
Boring routine- the moves are extremely easy to follow, but they consist mostly of lunges and jumps.
Uninspiring music- the video jacket boasts ""spicy latin music,"" but beware...it is nothing of the sort.
Great for those who carry weight in the buttocks and legs, not-so-great for those who carry weight in the stomach- the routine is, like I said, a lot of lunging and jumping so it tones up your legs and butt fast! Although there is a 15 minute bonus toning section including ab work, it is not even enough to feel the burn (I'm used to doing ALOT of ab work though).

Overall, the tape is effective, and it seems that after only a week of using it, my body has already begun to shrink! Just take into consideration the amount of jumping that Minna does, and proceed with caution if you have weak knees or ankles.",1104883200,6,1346,4.341269841269841
1390813,5,B000053V6O,"I don't think I've ever given any other workout tape five stars (not even in those reviews that only exist in my head), even though there ARE ones I keep going back to... but I actually LOVE this tape. First of all, Minna is adorable. She is so blessed with natural charm and the fact that she usually runs out of breath by the end of the cardio parts will just make you love her even more... for not making you feel like a total loser simply because you're sweating like crazy after only a couple of minutes. And you SHOULD be prepared for some serious sweating; like, remember those scissors jumps from elementary school? I almost forgot they can get SO lethal! Yes, Minna uses some of the basic-basic movements on this tape, but she must be using them in the right order and at the right intensity, because you'll feel really, really worn out by the end. Okay, at least I do and I like to think I'm in a pretty good shape.

There's also a 15 minute set of targeted exercises at the end of the tape, where she uses a couple of light handweights, but if you don't have those, you can easily use those heavier ashtrays you have at home.

Oh, the girls in the back are great choices, too - there's this really skinny one, a not-exactly slim one, a pretty muscular Asian girl that has this very cute smile on her face all throughout the workout and an approaching-middle-age lady. They are just all real cute AND natural, so you won't feel ashamed of your body only by looking at them.

Great people, great set of exercises - I absolutely recommend this one.",1098489600,13,1556,4.358620689655172
1390814,4,B000053V6O,"I'm on my latest 'must get in shape now' plan and saw this tape at the library. I figured, it's free, why not check it out.
I couldn't believe how much this tape kicked my butt. But in a good way.
Sure you do a lot of lunges and squats, but Minna always seems to keep you motivated.
Why none of the participants in the video were sweating, is beyond me. I definitely got a great workout and will incorporate this tape into my weekly routine.",1060560000,2,441,4.1395348837209305
1390815,5,B000053V6O,"I recommend this video, without a doubt, if you are currently in good shape in respects to endurance and lower body strength.  I was initially apprehensive as to the kind of results after working out only 35 minutes. But, I am no longer!  I have been doing pilates and am an avid hiker and cross country skier and am in good shape; but after doing this video, muscles that were not sore before were!  I am slim too but after a month of using this video, my body has shrunk in size.  Clothes just fit a little looser and I do indeed stand up straighter.  I think that the tape was a mastermind in regards to keying in on an overall body conditioning and strengthening.  Also, I have never had the ab results that I have gotten from the 15 minute workout.  This is my primary tape now and have to remember to not do it a day before long hikes since my legs are usually pretty exhausted from the tape!",1048291200,,898,4.216374269005848
1390816,5,B000053V6O,"Buy this tape!  Minna is by far my favorite aerobic instructor on the market because neither her style or her perfectly fit body are annoying like so many others out there.  Her tapes are fun, and they get the job done in good time.  Fat Eliminator is great if you want to tone and get the heart rate up in one quick workout.  Plus there's added weight work at the end if you have a little extra time to target your muscles.  The sessions are effective either together or alone.  Don't get suckered by those 12-minute targeted toning tapes.  With this video you can have your cardio and that targeted toning with a one stop purchase.",1044489600,,633,4.405172413793103
1390817,5,B000053V6O,"This is one of my favorite exercise videos.  I've had it for several months and it still works up a sweat and burns my thighs.  It's circuit training with 6 intervals alternating strength and cardio.  It's mixed impact, some sections have higher impact then others.  It's really great for thigh toning.  At first I had trouble getting through some the exercised, but now I can complete the whole tape.  The moves are pretty basic and Minna has exelent cueing and instructions.  After the 30 minute circuit workout there's a 15 minute toning section which is also effective if you are using the proper amount of weight.  I recomend this for intermediate and advance exercisers.  If you're a beginner you may have to modify it a little.",1011225600,,734,4.761904761904762
1390818,3,B000053V6O,"I own the Minna Lessig Strength and Grace workout and really enjoy doing that video, so I thought I would enjoy this one too.
Unfortunately, I didn't.
She should be called ""Knee-na the Lunging Princess!""
This whole video is lunge after lunge after lunge. The first 3 circuits (both the strength and cardio portions) are ALL lunges. If you have bad knees, or knees that get sore easily, avoid this video. I had to modify every exercise, even in the cardio portions of the circuits, which included Jumping lunges!
On a good note, I did like the fifteen minute bonus weight training portion at the end of the video, which had some excellent ab work. I also liked the one circuit that focused more on punches and shoulder strengthening.
I hope this was helpful!",1010361600,19,757,4.656716417910448
1390819,5,B000053V6O,"I was really impressed with the Minna's style in this video.  It was different from the Kathy Smith style that I am used to, and in my hectic schedule I actually looked forward to doing the fast paced Fat Eliminator video.  None of the moves were that challenging but they definitely got me moving and sweating.  The circuits work well throughout the movie to keep you energized and not worn out.  The last strength circuit is a bit strange but at the end of the 30 minute workout Minna and her wonderful four other ladies are incredibly energetic and encouraging to keep you going.  If you have the extra time, the 15-min. bonus includes some great Ab work.",1006214400,4,658,4.5423728813559325
7930246,1,B000053V6O,Horrible on the knees. Gets really boring after a few months.,1467763200,,61,4.636363636363637

7930248,5,B000053V6O,"I absolutely LOVE this workout video! It's by far the best workout video I have come across. Minna alternates between strength and cardio. The video does have a crazy amount of lunges and squats but that is the fastest way to eliminate fat. I nearly died the first time I tried the video. I couldn't make it through half of it, but don't worry, because as you build your endurance you'll be able to make it through the entire video. And it's such a great sense of accomplishment when you do! I love that Minna pushes you to the point where you think you can't do anymore and then she switches to the next move. The video goes by so fast and doesn't feel redundant.

I have used this workout video SO much that it's getting to the point where the picture quality and sound are slowly dying. Minna why isn't this on DVD??!! I can't seem to find it anywhere. If it's available, let me know asap! I'll buy up a bunch of them so I never have to be without my Minna: Optimizer-Fat Eliminator. Best workout video ever!",1297468800,,1011,4.321052631578947
7930249,5,B000053V6O,"This is my 'go to' exercise dvd for a good mix of cardio and strength; it firms me up and gets me in bikini ready shape before every caribbean vacation. I have been using this DVD for many years and keep going back to it even though I keep trying other programs. It is a 20 minute workout (which is great if you are short on time!) with an add on 15 mins weights and cruches.  This is definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS. it uses a lot of squats and lunges and if your leg muscles are not toned you will feel it in your knees.  If you do the exercises properly and have good leg muscles it causes no problems with your knees.  Done at least 3x per week, this workout will tone your legs, butt and help you lose the fat around your middle.  It is a great workout and I would recommend it for anyone serious about getting in shape.  Great value add in any exercise library.  Minna is a great instructor.",1231632000,,894,4.109195402298851
7930250,4,B000053V6O,"I bought this video on VHS in 2001 after I had my first child.  I was desperate to lose the weight and tone up.  I found that after about 2 months of giving this exercise video a try I was in better shape than before I even got pregnant!  Every exercise routine reaches a plateau, however I found that the better in shape I got, the more fun this video is.  I admit I couldn't even get through the first two circuits when I first started, and woke up so sore I couldn't even walk up the stairs.  A few years later, I'm still loving this video and use it as a great and fast cardio workout.  I'm not a fitness expert, and I read a lot that this is beginner/intermediate, but it is a good basic video with no corny whooping and hollering.  She is down to earth, but gives enough motivation in her video to keep up with the workout.  Minna is awesome, and I do have a lot of her videos in my collection.",1200700800,,900,4.045197740112994
7930251,4,B000053V6O,"i did this workout this morning.  i rented it from my local library on VHS [doesn't seem to come on DVD?].  i really like minna's workouts as they add alot of variety.  they are not the same ole boring repetitions.  she alternates between toning and cardio and they are fairly short segments [circuits], which prevent burn-out.  i like the music as well and she throws a *few* dance and boxing moves in there to add variety as well.  the moves were nothing too complicated and easy to pick up without adding anymore strain to your workout.

i also like minna's personality as she does not 'chit-chat' through the whole thing.  she has a pleasant voice and style that does not irritate.

minna dresses fairly modestly, which is something i was concerned about when i started searching workout programs.  her top is a little too low-cut, which isn't a problem until she does push-ups or other exercises that require her to bend down.  it's not a video i would play with any males in the room, not that i exercise with a bunch of them standing around anyway.

i would have to say that this is not for a beginner.  it is pretty tough and seems to be for people who are already fairly in shape and want to get a little stronger and maintain.  the title seems deceiving.  if you think you have fat to eliminate, then you probably won't be able to do this all the way through at first, or maybe even second.  it wore me out, but i am challenged and would like to revisit it so as to work myself to this level.

another thing i have noticed about minna's workouts [i have done two so far] is that it seems you need to warm-up before her warm-up.  her 'warm-up' consists of fairly fast cardio-type stretch exercise 'thingies', for lack of a better phrase.  it's like you need to warm up first before you do her warm-up.  her warm-up was pretty intense [esp. in her '1 minute workout' dvd].  it's minor and not enough to deter me, but thought i would point that out.  :o)",1184025600,,1961,4.403899721448468
7930252,3,B000053V6O,"As others have said, it's not for those with bad knees. The workout involves a lot of jumping and squats.

But if that doesn't apply to you, and you're looking for a decent mix of cardio and toning, this is a great buy. I always work up a sweat during the cardio portion. (A couple of the circuits could be a tiny bit more challenging to get your heart rate up higher, so if you're in above-average shape this might not be the video for you.) The 15-minute ""blast the fat"" toning for legs, arms, and abs is excellent. I esepcially like the abs section. Granted, the moves aren't anything I haven't done before, but she does the right amount of reps to make the stomach burn.

Lastly, Minna is a pleasant instructor -- her cues are right on and she keeps you motivated without being annoying.",1158278400,2,791,4.374149659863946
7930253,4,B000053V6O,"I was hesitant to try this DVD, as I generally hate workout DVDs and don't find them useful, but after trying it out, my mind has been changed.  I actually can see the results of three days a week of Fat Eliminator:  in only four weeks there's more tone in my thighs and [...], and I can now fit back into my ""skinny jeans.""  Even though the workouts are hard (and ""hard"" is an understatement), they leave me energized and looking forward to the next one.  As for Minna, she is easily the best instructor I've seen on a DVD.  She's encouraging without being cloying, and she's done a great job in putting together a workout that those of us who lack the coordination for dance moves can do.  Her instruction is easy to follow without being too talky.  She also looks like someone who's in shape and not just skinny and has muscled rather than just skinny people working out with her, which is nice to see.

There are a few issues that make me rate this four stars instead of five, though.  They are:

*  There is no mention on the DVD of how much the Fat Eliminator half works the knees.  If you have knee problems, definitely talk to a doctor before you pick up this DVD.

*  The workout gets repetitive.  I like that it targets the lower body, but lunge after lunge after lunge is boring, even though it does work.

*  The music could be better.

Overall, even with those issues, I highly recommend this workout.  You will definitely feel the burn---within the first 10 minutes my legs are exhausted, and I work up a good sweat by the time the 30 minutes is over.  If you do this DVD on a regular basis, you WILL see results.  I'm less enthused about the Strength and Grace portion, but I'm not much of a yoga person; if you're into yoga, you'll probably like it a lot more than I did.",1145232000,,1787,4.2746268656716415
7930254,5,B000053V6O,"I've been working out for an entire year consistently; LOVE squats & lunges.  However, while looking for something new for variety, found this video but wasn't sure about its effectiveness without weights (can squat 50 lbs for 65 reps).  OH MY GOD!! this workout will have your legs SCREAMING!!! I've seen a little more cut within the thigh muscles already.  Never underestimate a workout using only body weight.
