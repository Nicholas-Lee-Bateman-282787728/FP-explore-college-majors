The rides are taken a bit faster than what he'd ride, he's a slower cruiser; but the different rides in the DVD are motivating and he's wanting to take some of the same trips. There are more DVDs for other areas around the U.S., I know he's planning on getting more of them.",1231286400,,397,4.102564102564102
