This DVD is just several boring clips of simple Muay Thai moves thrown together.  For real fights, Muay Thai Ultimate Fights 1 & 2 are still my favorites.",1166054400,,274,4.551020408163265

8031875,3,B0002TT02S,"I liked much of the competition and training footage, but the format of this DVD is what drags it down into sleep-inducing territory: it's basically a flowery promotion piece of Muay Thai (and its place in Thai culture) that reeks of Ministry of Culture funding.

Luckily I only Netflixed this one, it came as two DVDs, and I was hoping that at least one of them would have some full-length footage of actual MT contests but no luck.

Disc 1 does have a somewhat interesting section that shows all the hand, elbow, knee, and kicking techniques of Muay Thai but it does so very breezily, more to show off than really to show you how to do these things.  So be forewarned that this is no training DVD.  Many of the allegedly ""defensive"" techniques also seemed a bit dodgy, kind of like simple common-sense reactions that they're packaging as some special ""techniques"" such as defending against a punch by kicking your opponent first...DUH!!!

There are some compelling clips of Thais as well as foreigners competing and training, this was really the best thing on the DVD but it was only maybe 20% of the whole movie.  If you are interested in pre-fight ceremonial dances and the cultural history of Muay Thai you'll get plenty of that, but I found it a bit excessive and it started to bore me.",1136332800,9,1292,4.620087336244541
