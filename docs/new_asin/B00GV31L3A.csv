Pigs help humans find truffles.  Well, the South African military needs a way to fly airplanes without so many large birds around that can cause bird strike.  (For an interesting exploration of that problem, see Anthony Hopkins film The Edge.)  Thus, South Africa asks a British zoo to send its two adult and three young caracals over so the big cats can begin hunting down large fowl.  Its great to see a symbiotic relationship, rather than a parasitic one.  Still, if you find the human interest angle to be selfish, you may not like that this work fails to examine caracals just as everyday creatures.  Still, if you like works with positive outcomes, then this could warm your heart.
Im going to be honest.  I didn't even know what a caracal was.  Seeing this documentary helped me to learn something new each day.  Its great to know that lions, tigers, leopards, inter alia, are not the worlds only existent big cats.  Ive always heard the line that captive animals can never be put back into the wild, but this documentary shows an exception.  Also, the five cats have individual personalities or traits.  The father wanted to adapt the least.  The narrator even predicts that too much contact between the father and one son will eventually lead to a fight to the death.  The females often take the initiative in the new challenges ahead of the group.
This work was also fascinating to me as Ive never seen a cat, besides the lynx, with huge, almost rabbit-like ears.  The work takes note that some of the caracals have floppy (what I would call bent) ears, rather than erect ones.  Its never explored whether the cats have great hearing due to their large ears.  We do learn that the cats are enemies with jackals and will eat small rodents or bugs at times.
If you like the idea of parent birds throwing their young out the nest to force them to fly, then you will like the progression of the tail here.  The work never explains why caracals were imported from Britain when its implied they are native to Africa.  Before being put into the environment, they are kept quarantined for two months.  I appreciate that the people who planned this were so cautions.
Again, on the lines of human interests, Top Cat appears near the start of the program in the same logo that Tom Cruises Top Gun was written.  Its implied that these cats are being trained just as Richard Gere was in An Officer and A Gentleman.  If the human-centric, anthropomorphic angle of this program would eat at you, you may find this portrayal problematic.  Still, for self-interested folk who always ask, Whats in it for me?, this equation of the cats to humans will help them to keep watching.
I haven't seen a nature special in a while that really kept my attention the way this did.  I applaud the makers of the program for releasing this.",1420934400,,2964,4.576850094876661
