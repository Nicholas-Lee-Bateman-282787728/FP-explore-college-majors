Oval Portrait:

It seems some of Poe's classics should not be made into film. In this tale a family gets together for the reading of a will at a house that appears to be haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, whose oval portrait appears on the wall. The haunting effects are poor, as in turning a camera on/off poor, something that dates from the 1920's. We do find out about Rebecca which consumes much of the film.

Originally released in 1972 as ""One Minute Before Death."" It has a low budget Mexican feel to it. The acting wasn't great either.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, nudity, or sex between two living people.

Devil's Daughter:

Nothing like a bad Italian combination of ""Rosemary's Baby"" plus ""The Wrath of Khan"" to make for a low intensity boring film. The beginning of the film opens with evil satanic bikers killing i.e sacrificing some desert hippies. It then jumps to 1991 Frankfort where a Van Helsing looking guy (Herbert Lom) sticks a bug up a school teacher's (Kelly Curtis) nose. Very long. Very boring. Not well acted. There are better ways to spend your time and money.

Released under the title ""La setta.""

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1350604800,,1256,4.626126126126126
