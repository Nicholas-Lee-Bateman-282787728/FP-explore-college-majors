7937375,5,B00005BCMM,"In honor of author/producer Bill Cosby's 74th birthday, I will leave my humble reflections on the sweet little title character he has based loosely on himself.
 Being from the ""Fat Albert "" generation,I first began watching Cosby's newer animated series, ""Little Bill""(voiced by Xavier Pritchett) ten years ago, when very young cousins of mine came to visit. Its animation style reminded me of books I enjoyed as a child, and the characters who shape Little Bill's world create a warm, secure, and loving environment for him as he deals with the issues of childhood.
  These include his mother, Brenda(voiced by Phylicia Rashad), his father, Big Bill( the late great Gregory Hines), his sister, April(Monique Beasely), his brother, Bobby(Devon Malik Beckford), great-grandmother, Alice the Great( Ruby Dee), and his friends Andrew(Zack Tyler) Kiku(Eunice Cho),and cousin, Fuschia(Kianna Underwood).
 We follow the five-year-old's adventures with his pet hampster, Elephant, and as he learns to tie his shoelaces,make sure he is on time for school, take pictures, deal with someone close to him moving away,is entertained by an elderly jazz singer, and learns to keep his focus on enjoying a family outing despite the loss of his little sailboat, among many other adventures.
  As had ""The Cosby Show"" a decade earlier, it depicts a strong African American family in a positive way, but people of all races and creeds find it to be a relatable as as well as an enjoyable series, which always ended with Little Bill in his room reflecting on what he had learned to his invisible audience to the puzzlement of his family, and the response of the five-year-old's secretive and sweet giggle. Any series that ends that way has my vote .",1310428800,,1730,5.095406360424028

7937377,5,B00005BCMM,"We first started watching Little Bill when our girls were toddlers.  It quickly became one of our favorites because of the way it addresses issues important to young children, because it so much less annoying than Oobi/Barney/Teletubbies, because it has great music, and because Little Bill is just so cute.  It's also nice to see African Americans as the main characters instead of as extras to fulfill the carefully balanced, politically correct mix of skin colors you usually see, and this makes it easier to raise color-blind children.  We're buying this video because our girls are in preschool and kindergarten now, and the TV show comes on while they're in school.  We missed hearing his adorable little songs. :)",1113782400,4,720,5.025210084033613
7937378,5,B00005BCMM,"THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! Bill Cosby for creating such a wonderful series of books and videos. Last year while pregnant with our first child I began to look for books and videos that were educational and entertaining which she  could watch. So we were quite ecstatic when we came across Little Bill one Saturday morning (Saturdays at 8:30 a.m. Channel 2). Since that day we have purchased every Little Bill book (every series, there are a few) and video. We even have the Little Bill doll. Our daughter has been watching and enjoying Little Bill since she was four months old. She looks forward to Little Bill every day. Already she is familiar with the opening jazz number.
If you looking for a book/video series that is both educational and entertaining that you both can enjoy (where you don't have to worry about the content) THIS IS IT. It has something for both the child and the parent (the jazz touch is great, like Bugs Bunny with the classical music). Not too mention the familiar voices of Ruby Dee, Phylicia Rashad, Gregory Hines, etc.)
We just purchased the Merry Christmas, Little Bill video. The first one will pull at your heartstrings, the second and third are just a fun look at children and their imaginations.
Parents will find themselves wanting to watch Little Bill almost as much as the child. I agree with reviewer Karl W Berner, it is the most entertaining and delightful children's television show airing today.",1038787200,10,1450,4.776892430278885
7937379,5,B00005BCMM,"Bill Cosby can never go wrong because he cares about kids and all of humanity!  I was introduced to Little Bill initially by purchasing Bill Cosby's first collection of Little Bill books before I had a child.  I purchased this video for my 3 year old son and he can't get enough!  Little Bill's laugh is too cute!  My husband and I love to watch the Black family themes and images with bonds of love and friendship that our son experiences with us everyday.  Moreover, it's great for all cultures to see...not just African Americans.  The music has the ""Cosby"" jazz touch and great for us adults to tap our toes while we watch. We will continue to build our collection of Little Bill videos for our children to enjoy for years to come.",1014336000,7,735,4.447761194029851

Come join a young boy growing up in New York City with his family, friends, and adventures.  You'll laugh.  You'll empathize.  You'll fall in love with Litte Bill.",1001116800,3,323,4.925925925925926
7937381,5,B00005BCMM,"Hello, friend! I bought this tape for my 3-year old yesterday and we've already watched it five times!  The Little Bill show on Nick Jr. is one of my favorites because it teaches important lessons in the setting of a supportive family unit (and I don't have to screen it for guns, violence, or rude language).  I highly recommend this tape.",994636800,5,340,4.557377049180328
