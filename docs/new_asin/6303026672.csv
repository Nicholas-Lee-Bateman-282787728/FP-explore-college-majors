534548,4,6303026672,"This amazing tribute documents the sacrifices and triumphs of the brave marines who risked and lost their lives to take Iwo Jima from a defending Japanese army of 21,000 that was dug into the volcanic island in a labyrinth of tunnels, caves, pillboxes, and sniper nests.  The island was needed by the US military as a airfield for the assault of the Japanese mainland and an emergency landing base for damaged aircraft returning from Japan.  Japanese soldiers defended the 8 square mile island almost to the last man.  The invading marines had little shelter on the denuded island from the continual onslaught of Japanese firepower, and were forced to battle uphill one pillbox and defensive position at a time until the island was secured at the cost of 6,800 American lives and 19,000 wounded.  With original color motion picture footage shot during the assault of the island interspersed with interviews of the marines, sailors and army air corps veterans who survived the 36 day battle, this unnerving and honorable film offers an excellent overview to anyone interested on one of the pivotal battles of WWII.  Highly recommended.  Warning: includes some graphic images of dead soldiers, some horribly maimed.",1251849600,10,1213,5.101010101010101

534592,4,6303026672,"Gross but relates to actual suffering on both sides.  Courage and valor have meaning when we come to know the reality.  It also helps me know why the nuclear option was necessary to end the suffering on both sides.

Historical note not in the video:  Casualties on both sides were expected to be horrific: 100,000 to 400,00 for the US while 500,000 to 2 million for the Japanese with conventional warfare continued. The A-bombs saved lives on both sides.  Even after both A-bombs were used, hard-line Japanese soldiers tried to capture the Emperor and destroy the records to be used in his surrender broadcast the next day.  A  conventional ""1,000 plane"" bombing by the US  caused the unintended disruption of this attempt to stop the surrender.  Most people don't know conventional warfare was to continue until the US had victory.

The Japanese had accurately predicted where the US invasion of Japan would take place. On a personnel point my father was to be a landing craft operator in the invasion effort.  Life expectancy was very low for these operators as they  were to make multiple trips landing troops.",1443139200,,1113,4.861702127659575

534643,5,6303026672,"The battle of Iwo Jima, was messed up even before it began.  The pre landing naval barrage, was a failure.  The japanese defensives positions were not destroyed.  The allied estimate of the number of jap troops on the island was wildly inaccurate.  When the marines landed, they ran into a buzz saw, Gen. Kuribayashi lured them into his trap.  The fact that the japanese could not win this battle was clear fron the onset of hostilites.  This was a battle of carnage, one side was clearly beaten, but would not surrender, and the other side was forced to go in an dig them out of thei fortifications.

534646,4,6303026672,"There is present a most difficult accomplishment that US Armed Forces are credited with in the successful action hereby acknowledged as Iwo Jima:The True Story. The two DVD set states that in the storied history of the United States Marine Core there were during World War II a total of 81 Medals of Honor awarded to Marine Core Service men and of those 81 Medals awarded to the Marine Core 27 were awarded to Marines on Iwo Jima. This very difficult perhaps even most difficult conquest cost US Armed Forces a greater total number of casualities than it did the Empire of Japan. The Japanese had constructed a interlinked series of tunnels that one opinion suggested that these underground tunnels were as much as 4 and 5 stories deep,that is entirely underground and nowhere to be scene. This desolate looking barren landscape was a virtual killing ground of mole hill to mole hill,pill box to pill box,bunker to bunker. The proximity of this island of molten ash and rock was unavoidable with its defenders representing an inner ring of defense vital to Japans security. There was very little natural defenses that Iwo Jima possessed perhaps to the exclusion of Mount Surabachi located on the Southern End of the Island. The Japanese were not the only adversary that the taking of Iwo Jima represented. The beaches were all of Molten Ash with Tanks and virtually anything that moved on wheels sufferring loss of traction as a result. The Japanese knew the Island better and were very prepared to die dearly for there Emperor. There were some 20,200 Japanese defenders of which nearly all were to die with save be but for 216 prisoners of war. The fighting was non stop,that is it went on round the clock. The many casualties sufferred by US Marines a true percentage was extracted by virtue of the round the clock grapple with death known as battle fatigue. Marines lost some 6,000 Men killed with nearly 17,000 wounded. Though this was a battle of attrition for the Japanese it served notice to both sides as this two disc set states in 36 days of Hell. One account by a surviving Marine Core veteran tells of a Japanese 30 Calibre machine gun getting a bead on this survivors story. He told how the incessant fire from a thirty calibre literally blew away every inch of this legitimate size bolder being used to protect our survivor. In a manner of speaking this was a true life story telling and down to earth details that Iwo Jima:The True Story represents. There is much to the legacy of this battle and most important its aftermath. The landing field on Iwo Jima saved  many hundreds of lives and many B-29s as the proximity of Iwo Jima allowed our bombers a base to land. There were some 300 B-29s to be stationed on Iwo Jima before the Wars end. This was part of the equation that was figured into Was it Worth it ? Is it possible to know this day any other way then to have been there? The witnesses are a real asset as they represent surviving servicemen who were there and whose real life stories are in fact real life stories. The two-disc offer provides enough information to allow for a good listen as would be a valuable lesson in warfare in the South Pacific. It is that and it worth much in that particular regard. The responsiblity for the telling of a story and a great story as well should not be overlooked. This is the real thing a story unlike any other story for it is a real story. A very well thought out presentation and a highly recommended viewing. The second disc provides the voices of two famous persons who like others in the entertainment industry did their part. The voice of Raymond Massey,sounding very much like he did in ""Action in the North Atlantic"" talks of the war as it concerns us in Europe. Captain Tyrone Power is thorough in his desire to sell the audience on War Bonds,both of these men are worth listening to. A most interesting section is dedicated to the B-29-A Flying Super Fortress. We learn that the B-29 had innovative wing storage ability for fuel,it was the first long range bomber to have a pressurized cabin,it was the first to have remote control gun turrets with a new High Altitude Precision bombing ability with the name of IBM being mentioned. The B-29 is considered the best of the war and the best that US Forces used in the Campaign in the South Pacific. It is a very informative and interesting discussion when we listen to the problems this rush to production B-29 had as it made its way into the war. There were interesting mentions of the overheating that the Wright Engines had as the B-29 challenged all. There was a section entitled ""The Road To Iwo Jima"" whereby some naive assumption are significantly challenged. It is revealed that better than a full year prior to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan,the United States took such actions that looked not so different than the kind of actions that today we have a pot marked landscape in the middle east. FDR initiated a full oil embargo on the Empire of Japan,there was additionally other limits to natural resources were as well put in place and to add insult to injury the Headquarters for the Pacific Fleet was moved to Hawaii from San Diego,Ca. The involvement that this causes to occur is provocative,though it may very well be a date that will live in infamy it was not so simple to suggest how such conduct came to occur. Do not mis-understand the actions by the United States. The actions by the United States were in responce to Japans aggressive conduct in china and elsewhere and can be said in good faith were not merely provocative they wished not for war though such a heavy handed ability position is hard to ignore. There remains the lives of two surviving veterans who tell of the difficult moment when it was finally determined that there were no more Japanese on the island of Iwo Jima. One of the two men sounded almost in shock with the other surviving veteran telling when a few remaining japanese soldiers attacked a base located at the foot of Mt. Surabachi killing many Flyers. I can not tell the reader different,this was the real story and the real story is why Iam here.",1335657600,,6152,4.602914389799635
534647,2,6303026672,"This was a movie designed to highlight the life of Booker T. Washington who was born a slave, but set free by the Civil War while he was still a young boy.  He defied the general trend of the times in which blacks were not supposed to learn how to read.  He did learn to read and became college educated, a teacher, an orator and an early civil rights leader.  Unfortunately, this movie covers very little of his story.  It is only an hour long.  It shows highlights from his boyhood, but ends when he is a young adult and only briefly mentions the many achievments of his life, as the movie is ending.  It really doesn't show much about him, other than he learned to read -- against many odds.  I would have like to have seen a second hour showing the important consequences of his learning, and illustrating his many contributions to civil rights back in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Also, this copy looked like it was a VHS dub.  It could have been a much better product.  Generally, the movie didn't seem to me to do this great man full justice.",1270684800,4,1055,4.336734693877551
534648,4,6303026672,"For the past decade, ever since James Bradley wrote ""Flags of Our Fathers"" the Iwo Jima fight has been the subject of films, other books and compilations of old and new documentary footage. I found this item in a bargain bin at a big-box store for half the price listed here, but I would have paid double for it. The 30,000 Marines who assaulted the island, backed up by perhaps 10,000 Navy and air personnel, trained for a year without knowing exactly where they were heading. The chosen target island was expected to fall inside of a week, but it took 36 days of brutal and unique combat to get the job done. World War II was too large, complex and lengthy to be  understood by studying one battle that took one month in one spot, but the courage of the soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines throughout the war CAN be comprehended by a study of the sacrifices made on Iwo Jima. Within a few years, there will be no more combat veterans left from that war---pretty much, anyone born after 1929 is too young to have gone to it at all, in any capacity. If the subject interests you, this item is well worth owning. I have also read at least six books on Iwo Jima, and each has a different enough look at what went on to be worth reading, and to have little duplication with other accounts. There is a reason that the U.S. Marine Memorial is a sculpture of the famous photo of the second flag-raising on the highest point of Iwo Jima, and this DVD set will demonstrate that fact. Even people who honor that image often do not realize that there were 30 more days of blood and bravery to come for those guys after that moment.",1252108800,20,1623,4.356435643564357
