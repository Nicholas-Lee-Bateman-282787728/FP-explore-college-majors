4368275,5,B004F88IYI,I saw this episode years ago when it first was shown on TV. Lots of local scenes and not on stages. Beautiful car too!!,1406073600,,119,4.0
4368276,5,B004F88IYI,My all-time favorite show. These were filmed before the interstate and in the real locations. I loved seeing the New Orleans French Market before its gentrification. The original Fish Market and the famous docks. Hoover Dam being built and life on the Louisiana oil rigs. So much history that is no more.,1402185600,,304,4.865384615384615
4368277,5,B004F88IYI,"When Tod and Buz take work on a commercial fishing boat in Astoria, Oregon and befriend the owner and her daughter, they also take on the wrath of a jealous rival fisherman (David Janssen) with deep-seated post-war anger issues.",1398643200,,228,4.871794871794871
4368278,5,B004F88IYI,"I live in the community this episode was filmed at. The shipwreck is IREdale not Errdale. Guest star was David Jansen as the baddie. Corny by todays standards, but fun to watch what it was like in Astoria, OR many years ago.",1398038400,2,224,4.357142857142857
4368279,5,B004F88IYI,"Good quality reproductions of the actual series. Clear and crisp images . Bonus material includes many of the commericals that were part of  the 1963 season.  good storylines and wide variety of each predicament the two got into. Glenn Corbett was the replacement for George,  but unfortunately the public (then) couldn't wrap themselves around a new side kick and the show ended.  Corbett had very good acting regardless of he being thrown into a show's demise.",1357862400,,462,5.0394736842105265
4368280,5,B004F88IYI,"By this I was old enough to understand the THRILL of the Road that my older brother found in Season 1 and 2. I also made up my mind that is was going to buy a BLACK Corvette, which wasn't available at that time but I didn't know that. That 63 Split Window Coupe was my baby.... and we were going to SEE AMERICA when I was 18... 5 years later.",1350864000,,342,3.8309859154929575

8427744,2,B004F88IYI,"I mainly purchased this episode because of guest star appearance from some of the classic horror movie icons, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney, Jr. It was rather disappointing.",1485993600,,169,5.296296296296297
8427745,5,B004F88IYI,Love the show!! Great Purchase!!,1484870400,,32,5.6

8427747,5,B004F88IYI,VERY GOOD FOR SENIORS WHO GREW UP WITH RTE 66,1452902400,,45,3.6
8427748,5,B004F88IYI,"Such beautiful quality and packaging, but I do wish it had captions ad perhaps a commentary. The. Fact that I get great guest stars like Boris Karloff, O Meyer Lorre, Lon Chaey (Jr.) Buster Keaton and Joe E Brown.  So glad  I but this one. Beautiful",1427846400,,249,4.391304347826087

8427750,5,B004F88IYI,good show,1425168000,,9,4.0
8427751,5,B004F88IYI,"Great season, though originally this set had a lot of issues. I would actually spend a few bucks more and get the entire series, it is well worth the little extra investment.",1417132800,,174,4.46875
8427752,4,B004F88IYI,"For fans of these three masters, it is so much fun to see them together again playing the old roles.  Surprisingly, Chaney is the standout and seems to really relish his roles (contrary to his attitude at the time when he made the original movies).  Also is a great bit of time machine for classic 60's TV",1416182400,,305,4.333333333333333
