4388287,5,B004ISVH34,"For those of us old enough to have witnessed the entire career of Frankie, from the Bobby-Socksers ot the late 30s up through his later years, this was a serious reliving of his many, many hits.  As the teenage idol with the Tommy Dorsey big band and throughout his professional life, he was a class act, and probably the best male popular song stylist of my lifetime. Anyone interested in a story of his life in his songs should really enjoy this, and for those interested in the history of big band, swing, blues and more that was popularized during his life, listen and learn!",1397779200,9,579,4.514285714285714
4388288,1,B004ISVH34,"So I opened this on  Christmas morning and put it into my region-free DVD player. I live in Tokyo, so region-free is the only way to fly. It listed up as ""wrong regions""

Then I tried playing it on my PC, and it wouldn't 't event register as a DVD'. A total waste of money",1387929600,,272,3.9272727272727272

4388291,4,B004ISVH34,"Contrary to another reviewer, I consider the picture quality
to be quite acceptable.  All four specials are excellent,
but my favorite is ""A Man and His Music+ Ella+Jobim"".
The show's highlight occurs in the last half with a
free-wheeling medley by Frank and Ella. It's almost as good
as Ella's amazing blues medley with Dinah Shore on Dinah's
wonderful ""Chevy Show"" (you can see it on YouTube).
And, by the way, someone should get wise and put out a set
of Chevy Show highlights.
