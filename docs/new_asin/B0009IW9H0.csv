I am pretty much a beginner, but have some understandings. I almost returned these unopened because I was afraid that these may be too basic for me - which turned out to be the case. For me, I should have purchased other DVDs. If you are not an absolute beginner, I would suggest you purchase other DVDs or purchase the DVDs separately if there  is something you don't know. Essentially, if you know the concept of barre chords, finger-picking, and bass runs and have used them even a little, I'm not sure that you need these DVDs. He shows you some stuff, but it is all very basic. Creating easy song arrangements was sort of new to me, but he did a lot of things he didn't explain adequately. He introduced additional notes and chords without a lot of explanation. I think that if you are presenting a course on creating easy song arrangement, just saying figure out what sounds good and do it, isn't really instruction. There was some new information, but it didn't always seem applicable in any general sense. He introduced something called a harmonic scale at the end, and I needed to look at other reference books to figure out what he was doing so I could apply it to another key. This concept was something I didn't know about before the DVD.

Although most of the material was too basic for me, and I expect I would have learned much more from other DVDs, I think the material was fine for people new to playing. Also, the quality of the video was fine.",1247356800,2,1587,4.376271186440678
8061371,5,B0009IW9H0,"As many have already said, Homespun productions are the best musical instruction DVDs on the market.  This 4 DVD set, purchased in the set, represents a great deal of information for the beginning guitarist at a great price.  This may be the equivelent of the beginning guitarist taking 6 months to a year of guitar lessons from a master, Happy Traum.

Each DVD is different and will take you to different areas of learning.  This is like a college 101 course that covers a good basis of guitar playing allowing you to ""graduate"" and move on to specific learning styles (fingerpicking, solo, country, blues, etc).  Happy covers so much material that you will end up confident in your playing, and ready to move on to the next level when you have completed this course.",1178064000,3,768,4.701492537313433
