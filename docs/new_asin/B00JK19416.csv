6365310,5,B00JK19416,"I can't understand the other low ratings given this film. I found the pace wonderful without the usual American action-every-second and constant loud music or sound effects. Instead, this film delivers beautiful cinematography and the use of wind interspersed with occasional music that preserves a renaissance feel (even played on period instruments). I wonder if this film was produced by the same makers of ""Renoir"" - another film using the sound of wind and beautiful scenes coupled with minimal dialogue.

One does not need a raging Mel Gibson to see a tragic figure destroyed by a conservative and cynical power. Mads Mikkelsen is superb in this film and does more with facial expression than most can do with words or actions. The minimalist script seems appropriate to the message of the film and conveys the silent strength of the leading character.

My guess is that those who are bored with this film are simply too enmeshed in American action films. I plan to rent this again and to watch in the same way one might play a symphony a second time. I think of this film as art, more than mere entertainment. others may need a high decibel level to achieve the entertainment they want.

Watch this film, but be patient. Don't work on you device while watching and enter another time and world and enjoy a tragic play that does have a predictable ending (but don't all tragedies?).",1403136000,17,1388,4.799163179916318
6365311,4,B00JK19416,"Much of the sequence of events gets left out, but the mood prevails

6365312,2,B00JK19416,"A very slow script and an ending that I'll bet didn't surprise anyone. In fact, I didn't notice much script at all. Just a lot of brooding and melancholia. Being rated R, there is violence and bloodletting, but it's understandable, given the circumstances, but a lot was based on the old vengeance syndrome. If I were to give it three stars, it would be because Mads Mikkelsen's acting shines brightest above all others, but I've seen him in better movies.",1402099200,2,456,4.7125
6365313,2,B00JK19416,"If just reading the overlong and unwieldy title for Arnaud des Pallires latest film has bored you to tears, don't even bother trying to endure Age of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas. Pallieres' adaptation of Heinrich von Kleist's 19th century novel has all the pieces to be a busy piece of revenge entertainment: conquering hero played by the typically rugged and awesome Mads Mikkelsen; handsomely shot windswept locales, and a real-life story with elements of Robin Hood and Braveheart. Yet for all of its individual glories, the film remains a largely inert and passionless whole that not even Mikkelsen can save.

Credit goes to Pallieres for maintaining the novel's existential flavor, but without a character to connect with it all amounts to nothing but a poor man's Braveheart, minus that film's vigorous battle sequences. Even the dispute which begins Kohlhaas' vengeful quest lacks any real heat, as he's a merchant who has two prized horses confiscated by an arrogant Baron throwing his weight around. Returning to claim the horses and the servant he left to tend to them, Kohlhaas discovers the animals have been mistreated and the caretaker cruelly attacked. Kohlhaas' plead to the court for reparations are dismissed due to the Baron's influence and power. For what feels like an eternity we are treated to repeated appeals to the court, all of which fail, until Kohlhaas' lusty wife is murdered attempting to make one final plea on his behalf. Cue the crazy rage and bloody revenge, right? Well, not exactly.

While Kohlhaas does set out to cut a swath through the countryside, slaying those he believes has wrong him so terribly, it all remains oddly distant. It doesn't help that Kohlhaas' desire to get his due has just as much to do with his lost horses than for his dead wife, and the lack of real internal fire he shows over either. That passion is certainly there while she is alive, as the two can barely contain themselves sexually even when in the presence of their daughter. The sparsely written script only hints at the ""ends justifying the means"" struggle within Kohlhaas, depicted with tight control by the ever-stoic Mikkelsen. But the entire film is an exercise in control, so much so that it never connects on a visceral level even when called upon to do so. Battles are few and far between and show Pallieres' weakness in staging trackable action. Better are the scenes when Kohlhaas is engaged in theological debate with a heady priest (Denis Lavant) or during a tense encounter with the Princess where everything he holds dear hangs on her every word. Unfortunately, these brief moments of genuine tension and intellectual complexity are just as rare as the sword 'n armor warfare a film like this sorely needs. Soulful imagery aside, Age of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas tediously tramples over its own potential.",1401580800,12,2869,4.962577962577963
6365314,4,B00JK19416,"This is a German- French co-production and is based on the novella by Heinrich von Kleist. That novella was based on the real man Hans Kohlass. In the film we see Kohlass played by the always excellent Mads Mikkelsen (`The Hunt', `Valhalla Rising' and now `Hannibal') as a horse trader. On the way to market he has two horse confiscated by the Baron who claims them as a toll charge.

Kohlass is not amused when he finds out the Baron has acted illegally and moreover abused the horses and set the dogs on his man servant. So after a few more attempts at justice he takes the law into his own hands and goes all out for retribution. Soon he has an `army'.

Now this is a two hour film and it does take its time in more than one place - poetic might be a way of describing it. But the novella, although published in 1810 was seen as written in an existentialist way with a linear narrative posing as a chronicle. I feel director Arnaud des Pallires wanted to capture that especially in the tunnelled vision pursuit of justice that Kohlass embarks on.

There are two covers for this in Amazon Instant you get the correct cover which is a still from the film and the Region 2 version has the UK version which is less than honest and is what the next sentence is referring to as this review is on both pages. This is also not an action film and once again we are subjected to misleading cover art that should be illegal, there are no screaming hordes and no castles set afire either so if you want an action film then give this one a wide berth.

There are notable performances from Mikkelsen, ably supported by German David Kross and veteran French actor Denis Lavant; Roxan Duran (`The White Ribbon') makes a spirited appearance as the Princess too. The cinematography is really nice and the horses and scenery are both beautiful and bleak when they need to be. So it is a well made, well acted and beautifully shot film and I even liked the music but I could have shaved some minutes off the run time hence my rating, but I am still glad I watched this and would recommend with the above caveats.",1399766400,31,2095,4.364102564102564

6365316,5,B00JK19416,"Beautifully shot, cast, directed, acted... tragic, and frankly, I couldn't finish it because I knew how badly it would end. But you may have a stronger stomach than I.

IMHO, the two best actors working right now are Tom Hardy and Mads Mikkelson. They are similar in that they are both minimalists. Hardy does more with his voice than Mikkelson, who prefers silence to all things, but what a face... the Greek sculptors of antiquity would weep over him, carved from pain and lit with the fires of hell.  Mikkelson wisely lets his face and body talk. Watch everything you can of these men and be glad you were alive at the same time.",1461715200,2,632,4.535087719298246

Excellent to see characters who actually believe in God and try to follow his will even when it is not in their heart. A lesson in how a man can regret his actions even when he has the capability to exact revenge or what he perceives as justice. The main character certainly does not want to hear what the Pastor has to say but heeds his word since he knows to accept rebuke. This makes him an even better more righteous man although doomed to face his punishments.

6365326,4,B00JK19416,"Though this seems to vary more than a bit from the actual historical event, it's still a heck of a movie.

Here's the scoop. Michael Kohlhaas is a horse trader on his way to trade fair. Two of his horses are taken as toll, by a particular Baron, to cross a bridge. The horses are terribly mistreated and Kohlhaas seeks justice from the court. When he is denied he enlists a couple of men and goes after the Baron. His few men turn into many and things get out of hand.

Mads Mikkelsen plays Kohlhaas who simply wants justice. The Kohlhaas depicted here seems to vary quite a bit from the actual version in that this one is more upstanding. It seems the original wasn't all that circumspect on who he killed or what villages he burned to the ground. But this movie is clearly on his side. Given the subject matter this is a surprisingly quiet movie. No great battles or final showdowns. Much attention is paid to the landscapes. The wondrous beauty is used, I suppose, to bolster the pureness of Michael. And he does not enlist his many followers. They find him because they believe in the cause. Yup. He's nearly a saint. I liked the ending. It was a real surprise. How does one achieve justice but still lose. Watch this and find out.

It's a beautifully shot movie and well acted. Mikkelsen says a lot with very few words. But it is probably too quiet for American sensibilities. Don't expect big Hollywood stuff here.

It might not be quite worth the 4 stars I gave it but it's well worth seeing for true cinephiles.",1438128000,,1519,4.433691756272402

Mikkelsen's acting is very good, however there is nothing epic about this movie, except how boring it is. The main character never gets revenge, at least not what American movie goers would call revenge. I expected some good action scenes. I expected a real uprising. The so called uprising was very softly depicted.

SPOILER ALERT--
The story is about this man Kohlhaas who gets screwed by a wealthier jerk who just became baron thru inheritance, his request to the court for the baron to compensate his is denied repeatedly, his wife is murdered by the baron (or his cohorts in the court), so he leads some peasants around pillaging a little bit (no real action to speak of), then he is sentenced to death, executed minutes after his original request to be compensated by the baron is fulfilled.

6365333,2,B00JK19416,"Age of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas is a historical drama based on a Heinrich von Kleist novella Michael Kohlhaas (1810). The French-German film is about a Robin Hood-like protagonist (played by Mads Mikkelsen), a horse dealer who becomes the leader of a band of rebels after being wronged by an arrogant baron and his lackeys, but don't expect a big action set-pieces here.

For the film is more about one mans quest for justice and the price he has to pay. Most viewers would find the long conversation between our hero and a theologist (Denis Lavant) more interesting than the action sequences that are few and far between (and not very impressive).

Despite the strong acting from the always reliable Mikkelsen (and the shocking events his hero has to undergo), we are not very much interested in the character Michael Kohlhaas. With the too understated storytelling, the film feels distant and lacks depth. I find the film not only slow-moving, but emotionally uninvolving, as it fails to convey the characters inner struggle.

By the way, the original Heinrich von Kleist novella was turned into an HBO film The Jack Bull in 1999 starring John Cusack. Its a western version. Just in case you are interested.",1422316800,,1225,4.908212560386473

6365339,5,B00JK19416,"In 16th-century France, as the feudal age comes to an end, horse merchant Michael Kohlhaas (Mads Mikkelsen) leads an honorable and quiet life with his wife, daughter, and servant.  One fateful day, however, a vainglorious and youthful baron (Swann Arlaud) confiscates a pair of his prize horses as an unlawful toll.  Frustrated by this exploitation, Michael turns to the court, but finds them reluctant to act due to the baron's wide-reaching influence.  Michael is then forced to exact justice himself, enlisting a band of farmers and laborers to fight alongside him as he pursues the baron.  His iron sense of purpose in this campaign is questioned by an itinerant priest (Denis Lavant) in a particularly thoughtful sequence in this grim historical drama.  The film is defined by a deliberate pace, a moral severity evocative of the oeuvre of Ingmar Bergman, and highly atmospheric photography of the late-medieval-period countryside, at once bucolic and desolate.  The film will no doubt prove a tad detached and glacial for many viewers, but those on its austere wavelength should find it involving and, in its final minutes, unexpectedly heart-wrenching.",1416700800,4,1159,5.271739130434782

I realized I was getting waaay into watching a much simpler life. Not like I want to live without icecubes or antibiotics when I really need 'em, or heating!!

Mads Mikkelsen's performance was a redeeming feature though.",1515369600,3,292,4.745098039215686
8651587,5,B00JK19416,"The limits of Jesus' teachings end a would-be revolution. The aristocracy does Kohlhaas wrong, he fails to win restitution in a rigged justice system and takes up arms, drawing popular support from the peasantry. Soon, Kohlhaas is wrapped up in his own image and hangs one of his own brave and loyal troopers for theft. A clergyman (in the legend, this would be Martin Luther) who is traveling with the revolutionaries begins guilt-tripping Kohlhaas, blunting his drives and derailing the uprising. This is where philosophy kicks in. Can you forgive your enemies? Can you forgive in the micro, but not in the macro? That probably makes more sense. If your enemies know in advance that you will forgive them, what will stop them from taking everything you have? Jesus said, ""If the strong man is home, the thieves will not enter"". But if the man of the house is devout, he will simply forgive the thieves. Forgiving can be the lazy man's response to a trespass. The only reason some criminals aren't kicking in your door right now, is because they think you may be armed. Kohlhaas forgives, disaster follows.
Mads is a great and watchable actor. Tall, and fit, he gives the impression of quiet power. Far more imposing than he seemed to be when playing Le Chiffre. The soundtrack is interesting. It is mostly just the wind. That, and some foreboding cello and other strings.
Someone called the film 'low budget'. Hey, it's not Braveheart. It isn't supposed to be. If this was an American film, Kohlhaas would have fallen in love with the Mother Superior of the convent his men burned, and would have been healed by her love and wisdom. All this after a candle-lit love scene.
By all means see this film, and wonder what would have happened to the American Revolution if the clergy was in charge.",1514505600,,1794,4.73482428115016
