I haven't laughed this much for a long time and I showed it to the little kids; ages 10 and 6 and they laughed as much as I did.  He knew how to 'surprise' his audience. You know something is going to happen sometime, but what and where...he's a master of catching you off-guard.  The old film was excellently preserved.  Thanks Buster.  A merry heart does good like a medicine.",1303516800,,503,4.522222222222222

You can't go wrong with Buster Keaton, he was the master of the Stone Face afterall... and so adorable! lol I'm 30 years old and my husband and I have been fans forever! If you love Buster Keaton this is a great choice with about 14 different shorts.",1237939200,3,321,4.4576271186440675
8169868,4,B000MM0ZW4,"Although the term ""DVD-R"" might sound discouraging, the only minus is that these discs do not have a menu, they just start up the second you put them in the player.  The transfers are more than decent (they aren't completely blurry or pixelated) and the accompanying music is more than appropriate.  The use of piano, violin and organ are what makes up most of the score.  None of that scary MIDI stuff.

The only thing that is slightly different from the other Keaton releases is that in the bottom corner of the screen is a small image of ""RE"" standing for Reel Enterprises, these discs' distributor.  It isn't that distracting and after a minute or two it's easy to forget altogether.

Altogether this is a great collection of Keaton shorts for a price that's more than fair (if you think about it, each short is about $2.00 each), and they are some of his best.  The only omission I care about is ""Neighbors"" from 1920, which I would say is one of his most charming two-reelers.

The reason I bought this was so I could have all the shorts that I wanted, then buy the Keaton discs from Kino according to what I want (a DVD here, another DVD there).  Overall, it saves you $100+ because you won't have to buy the whole Kino set.",1186531200,13,1231,4.435555555555555
