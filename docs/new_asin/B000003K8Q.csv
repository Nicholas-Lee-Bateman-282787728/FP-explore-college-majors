You could literally TOUCH the anguish,in Captain Siskos' voice,as he recited the names of those,whose lives were lost(that he was AWARE of)in trying to accomplish the critical""mission""of recovering a crashed Dominion ship,to unlock vital secrets,that might help the Federation,in the war against these invaders from the Gamma Quadrant..I really enjoy ANY episode,that features a changeling!! Especially a dead or dying one,since they appear invincible and virtually immortal at times,like that changeling ""Laas""from the ""Chimera""episode who could shape-shift into the form of a starship,and travel in the vaccum of space,AND turn into FIRE!! These changelings are IMPRESSIVE!! I was taken aback,the first time,I saw this episode(a decade ago)when Sisko,looked up and discovered that this whole crisis,was occuring because a critically injured Founder was on board this coveted ship..I LOVED,the chilling ""scream""this changeling made,as it was losing its' ability to hold its assumed shape,and came dripping down off of the ceiling!! The Jem Hadar killing themselves,was a powerful testament to their(disturbing)loyalty to the Founders!! Another part of this episode I,REALLY enjoyed,was when Jadzia tried to ""lighten"" the dark mood,of the situation with a(ill-timed)joke,and Sisko angrily snapped:""Dax,maybe you haven't noticed,but no one's LAUGHING!"" Worf and Chief O'Brien going at each others'throats over their differing concepts of death and dying,while watching a(terrified)mortally wounded cadet""expire""was a nice touch of drama!! Wonderful episode,that even ""non-Trekkies"" will enjoy!!",1203724800,,1690,6.32034632034632
7902739,5,B000003K8Q,"'The Ship' had me absolutely spellbound from preview to finish. I consider it one of the best episodes of the series. The emotions conveyed and shown in this episode are various and acted very well by our heroes and the guest-stars. The situation enacted was very entertaining and completely believable. It fit in well with DS9's continous Dominion story arc and, unbeknownest to us at the time, would set up another story in another episode further down the line, which the DS9 writers have a habit of - and a talent for - doing. Sisko was at his usual best; playing the tough-guy routine with the Dominion, trying to hold his men together under horrible conditions, and revealing his true inner feelings when all is said and done in such a way that you can't help but love this guy. Dax is in her usual role as Sisko's moral compass and shoulder-to-cry-on. I thought it was an interesting - albeit disturbing - twist to have Worf and O'Brien go at each other under the strain of their situation. It shows what can happen to even the best of friends under trying circumstances and wisely follows up with a reconcillation of sorts at the end. I enjoyed seeing Muniz again, displaying DS9's excellent skill at continuity. Because he is a known character at this point (not just a no-name redshirt) his death makes it that much more emotional not only for the characters but the audience as well. Absolutely LOVED Kilana. I've always thought the Vorta were a very well thought-of part of the Dominion concept and I usually enjoy them whenever they appear, but she was a real treat. She displays the usual coolness, lack of emotion, and superiority complex inherent in her people, but at the end we see her as an emotional and pained individual who deserves at least some sympathy for her plight. Although the Jem'Hadar are mostly present for some cool fight scenes, they do add to the emotional impact of the episode's revelation and you come away more convinced than ever of their devotion (designed or otherwise) to their leaders. Overall, the story told in this episode is an excellnt one that will try the emotions of anyone who watches and enjoys the genre. The ending is especially poignant, when you realize that, had things been done differently, both parties could have walked away happy. Aside from being a worthy addition to the Dominion storyline, this episode (not surprisingly) has a point and a lesson for those open enough to recieve it. For all these reasons, this is not one to be missed!",1125187200,,2504,4.719178082191781
7902740,4,B000003K8Q,"""The Ship"" (Story by Pam Wigginton & Rick Cason, Teleplay by Hans Beimler, Aired October 7, 1996) is actually a much more intimate sort of episode than you would expect for the 100th episode of ""Deep Space Nine.""  While exploring a world in the Gamma Quadrant, Sisko, Dax, Worf, O'Brien and Muniz, one of O'Brien's engineres see a Jem'Hadar ship crash onto the planet's surface.  The crew are killed, but the ship is intact enough for Sisko to want to use the Defiant to get it back to DS9 to study and learn some of the military secrets of the Jem'Hadar.  However, before that can happen, another Jem'Hadar warship appears and destroys the Federation runabout, killing all aboard.  Sisko and the others take refuge in the crashed ship and wait for the Jem'Hadar to attack.  But instead a Vorta named Kilana makes contact and demands Sisko give up the ship.  Sisko figures out that there must be something aboard the vesel that the Vorta wants, and the negotiations taken on a whole new tack.  Meanwhile, Muniz has been seriously wounded and needs medical attention.
""The Ship"" is actually an interesting meditation on the problems of negotiating with the enemy, especially if you think in terms of zero-sum games.  I am not sure if I agree with the idea that either Sisko or Kilana would have ever accepted a win-win situation, but I can certainly appreciate the notion that each would prefer to have a lose-lose outcome rather than risk having the other side ""win.""  Of course, there is an irony to the final outcome of the situation, and I think there would have been more of an impact to the episode if both sides had lost everything.  Still, this is a rather thoughtful episode from the show's fifth season.",1072742400,,1712,4.695652173913044
7902741,5,B000003K8Q,"The death of the ensign is worth twenty minutes of grief.  Like year one's ""Duet"", ""The Ship"" shows the price the men pay when involved in combat and the importance of trust in diplomatic discussion.
The conflict between Sisko and the female Vorta is a perfect commentary on war.

7902742,4,B000003K8Q,"Whilst on a mission in the Gamma Quadrant, Sisko and crew travelling in a defenceless Runabout (come on guys, in the middle of hostile territory!)  they find a Jem'hadar fighter that has crashed into a planet and is  half-buried beneath the surface. Sensors indicate everyone on board is dead  so Sisko decides to dig out the starship and send it back to Starfleet,  something that will greatly advance Starfleet's knowledge of the Dominion.
Sisko, Worf, O'Brien, Bashir and few irrelevant officers become trapped  in this Jem'hadar fighter when another warship arrives full of Jem'hadar.  For some reason the Jem'hadar will not risk entering the downed fighter and  killing the Starfleet officer, Sisko realises that there is something  inside this ship that is very important to them, if they find it they find  they're ticket out of danger!
This is a great episode that shows the  tension between Worf and O'Brien, unfortunately one of the irrelevant  Ensign-like officers is on his deathbed, unfortunate not because he dies  but because we have to put up with everyone mourning his death for 20  minutes. Apart from this small problem the episode is flawless, we see a  new side to the Vorta and a weakness in the Jem'hadar! Written by a Star  Trek fan who had never had anything commissioned before, this is a pivotal  story that would be looked back on in future episodes.",966729600,8,1378,4.9004329004329
