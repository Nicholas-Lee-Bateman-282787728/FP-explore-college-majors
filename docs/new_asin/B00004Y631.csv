1370721,4,B00004Y631,"C'mon really, why else would you buy the movie other than to see a bunch of crazy post-apocalyptic slicing and dicing?!? If you're looking for a epic battle film that will go down as a classic for its acting and storyline, buy Braveheart. If you want a film that doesn't expect you to consider the laws of physics while watching (let alone picking out all the flaws), buy this. Its a good, entertaining movie if you're interested in ""Mortal Kombat"" type movies or if you're a fan of ""Highlander""... if you're looking for Oscar material, you've got the wrong film. They shouldn't be put on the same level.",972604800,2,604,4.601851851851852
1370722,1,B00004Y631,"Having read Beowulf as a high schooler, I wondered if anyone could do justice to the epic poem.  Unfortunately, we will have to wait.  I evaluating the dvd, I wish I could come up with something artist or journalistic to say about it in order to sound like a movie critic, but all I can think of is ""the movie is terrible.""  Lambert's flat, unemotional performance leaves even the best of fans (I loved the Highlander) cold.  The highlight of the film has is the fight exchanges, and even then, the feats fall flat.  In a day when the Matrix and Jet Li (Romeo Must Die) have taken fight scenes to the next level, employing the latest and greatest computer aided and stunt techniques, Beowulf takes us back to the dark ages of cinematography.  My recommendation:  if you must see it, wait for it to come on television.  It is truly a ""B"" Movie....
BAD!",972518400,3,851,4.445161290322581

1370724,4,B00004Y631,"Put your brain on pause, and let Chrisphe Lambert's best film since the first Highlander, entertain you!  Its a strange mix of old and new, and  the actions scenes are very comic book in their execution. The only bad  points of the film are Rhona Mitra's incredible lack of acting skills, she  is the original 'Lara Croft'model, game fans, and the cartoon like CGI  monster... Those points aside, if you like movies with big swords, over the  top martial arts, big monsters and a pumping dance and heavy metal  soundtrack, Anthrax and Rob Halford are just two of the acts included, this  just might be the film for you.......",968544000,10,625,4.669724770642202
1370725,4,B00004Y631,"Well I have to state right from the outset that I am biased.  I love Christopher Lambert, especailly in these sword wilding smart cracking  roles.  This has to be the best fick he has done (in this vein) since the  original Highlander, and it is rather reminiscent of that title.  Following loosely on the Norse fable of the same name, Beowulf plunges the  viewer straight into a fantasy world with a technological bent.  There are  chain swords and hedge trimmer weapons, a huge steampunk-esque outpost, and  guys with armour reminicient of robocop.  Anyone who has played roleplaying  games the likes of Shadowrun or Castle Falukenstien will be right at home  here. The soundtrack is awsome (heavy rock and techno bents) and the  dialoge and acting are on par with the usual fair of todays mass produced  movies.  However this is definately a B-grade movie.  Not that that is a  bad thing.  I happen to like decent B-grade fair.  And this is quite  decent.  They spent quite a bit on the sets and props for this show, shame  they didn't spend just a little more on the CGI. Now to the bad points.  The female leads are reminicent of ex-porn stars, espically the blond  playing Grnedel's mother.  The women's cloths are designed to hide very  little and show off a lot, which turns some scenes into covers for Heavy  Metal Magazine! Despite this I give it quite a good rating 4/5, however  this is as a B-grade movie.  Good beer and pizza movie, ladies might not  see it that way. (and now I'm off to buy the soundtrack!)",966988800,10,1522,4.591760299625468

I ended up fast forwarding to scenes with the stunning Rhona Mitra, which I think is the only high point of this movie. It looks like they used different film stock at different points, making an uneven experience, and although a lot of care went into set/production design, it can't carry a movie like this that has cheesy dialogue, bad CGI, and no real meaning or life to it. It just looks weird, the film, like something low budget that came out of a 2nd world country (it was filmed in Romania). It reminded me of ""Yor, Hunter from the Future.""

His blend of humor and action is part of the reason I feel he's underrated.
He's shown versatility and ability in his acting.

1370745,1,B00004Y631,"Ah, Beowulf. The oldest piece of English literature. A vivid, compelling poem about the clash of man and monster, with subtext about the triumph of Christianity over the old pagan religions.

With that in mind... how about the story as a post-apocalyptic wangstfest with lots of female nudity?

Yes, some genius decided that the tale of a superhuman hero going up against a grotesque monstrosity to save a kingdom needed some Mad Max injected into it. And while the idea itself is not inherently bad, everything about the execution can be used in a ""How Not To"" guide -- it's a foul, muddy, overcomplicated mess that tries to dazzle us with rubber monsters, ridiculous weaponry, and a string of soap-opera subplots that don't really relate to anything in the main plot.

The mysterious warrior Beowulf (Christopher Lambert) rescues a young girl from a bunch of savages who want to sacrifice her, in order to exorcise the evil that is plaguing the cartoonish-looking castle of King Hrothgar (Oliver Cotton). But she runs back and gets killed, because she considers it a better fate than facing whatever horrors are waiting in the castle. Intrigued, Beowulf heads right to the castle to find out what is going on, and receives the best news possible: a monster named Grendel is coming to the castle every night, and killing people.

Hrothgar welcomes him warmly, since Beowulf is the only one who can kill Grendel. But others aren't so welcoming: his daughter Kyra (Rhona Mitra) believes Beowulf is representing her dead husband's family, and the powerful knight Roland (G&ouml;tz Otto) thinks Beowulf is a rival for Kyra's affections. Yes, we have terrible soapy subplots in this story, and none of them add up to anything.

Of course, it takes Beowulf awhile to come up with a way of killing Grendel, since the demon-creature's power is enough to wound even him. And in the meantime, Hrothgar is having strange memory-dreams of a seductive seminude woman (who looks like a refugee from a 1980s softcore-porn music video) whose presence is tied to his wife's death many years ago. When Beowulf seemingly kills Grendel, that woman's dark power threatens everyone in the castle -- and the only one who can stop her is Beowulf.

A sci-fi version of ""Beowulf"" is not a bad idea -- just look at the movie ""Outlander,"" which dabbled in just that idea. Neither are some of the other ideas, like a love interest for Beowulf or a post-apocalyptic setting. But this ""Beowulf"" is a complete disaster that squanders every possibility its setting and genre open up -- the setting could have made Grendel into a grotesque mutant abomination, or an alien creature feeding on human beings. Instead, they stick with safe territory: ancient demons that don't match the sci-fi setting,

The main additions to this story are the obnoxious soap-opera subplots -- Roland's rivalry with Beowulf, Kyra's murdered husband, and Grendel's parentage. None of these has any real relevance to the main story. And of course, they tried to throw in some sexy twists on the tale by depicting Grendel's mom as a succubus rather than a monster.

But even if the story weren't overloaded with miscellaneous subplots, the script is still a massive stinker, with long stretches of Beowulf just hanging around saying pretentiously emo stuff about how dark and tormented he is (""Only an idiot would want to come to this damn place."" ""Unless he was already damned""). The attempts to be gritty and dark merely make this setting grimy, dim and mucky, so that you don't much care if this bleak, miserable band of people end up surviving.

The costumes range from decent (Beowulf's worn leather getup) to the silly (horned helmets, see-through dresses, Hrothgar's eyeless mask), and the weapons are just hilariously bad. Hrothgar's sword is a giant saw blade with no point (much like the movie) and Beowulf dual-wields tiny crossbows and throwing axes, both of which are useless once he's used them a single time. And no matter how hard Lambert tries, tiny crossbows are never cool-looking.

And as a side note, the soundtrack is absolutely awful. Admittedly scoring it entirely with electronic and industrial music is a bold choice, but it's poorly chosen -- Grendel's killing spree and a funeral are scored with peppy, blippy electronica.

Lambert is absolutely lifeless as Beowulf, but admittedly he's playing a character with less dimension than a paper doll -- Beowulf spends all his time wangsting about how evil and dark and brooding he is. I'd say that it's in order to get into Kyra's pants, but Lambert and Mitra have the chemistry of a pair of coma patients. Otto mostly shows anger through making kissy-lips, but sadly his character is the most developed in the entire movie, despite being shelved as the ""love rival."" Cotton is the only actor who seems to be doing well as a grizzled, regretful king.

And a special mention must be given to Layla Roberts, a former Playmate who does little but lick Hrothgar's nose and writhe around wearing transparent netting. She is so mesmerizingly bad that she manages to make the laughable dialogue BORING (""Do your loins at this moment, at this moment of death, do they burn for me?"").

If you need a sci-fi version of the Old English poem, try ""Outlander."" This post-apocalyptic ""Beowulf"" is a mess in every way that matters, except perhaps as fare for a riffing party. Even Lambert's coolness can't break through the murky, muddy funk.",1447372800,2,5444,4.917211328976035

You'd be better off watching Abbott and Costello meet the Wolfman, because at least they're not trying to convince you it's something else entirely.

Now while this is not the worst film in the world - it certainly ranks higher than, say, Hobo with a Shotgun - that's not saying much because it could have been so much better, especially considering the cool electronic eighties music and the weird, dystopian, steampunk/road-warrior vibe that punctuates this film. No matter that it does a halfway decent job of following the original story - if you don't mind annoying references to Highlander immortality nonsense, ""I heal quickly. That's all I'm going to say"" - in the end the acting and writing are so bad you just can't help but laughing out loud throughout the film.

The only reason I'm not giving this zero stars is due to all of the seriously hot women running around throughout the film, women whose absence might have tempted me to smash up my living room after the first ten minutes of sitting through this film.

One theme of the movie was that there was a group of people that executed anyone leaving the outpost. The premise was that whatever was going on in there so traumatized these people that they were insane and needed to be killed. Having watched most of the movie, I think those guys got it right. The movie was that bad.

I would comment on acting, except I didn't see any in the movie. Even something as simple as walking with a crutch (broken leg) was botched. Everyone spoke in a whispered monotones. Maybe they didn't want their voices recognized ?!

The storyline was weak. You will figure it out in the first 15 minutes. It has a bit of a teen slasher feel to it. You keep thinking ""You moron, don't open that door!"" and they do, and bad things happen. And, as they are being killed off one by one, do they think to always be in pairs or more. No. Everyone liked wandering the halls by themselves until they were killed.

Special effects, yeah right, a guy in a rubber monster suit does not constitute special effects. And the good guy has lots of gadgety weapons. One of my favorite scenes is when the good guy is avoiding the villain by doing backflips through a puddle of water. Really?! The monster came over and swatted him. It was great! If the monster had just swatted harder, it would have ended the movie and all would be good.

If this movie were better acted, directed, and cut, it could actually be a pretty fun play on several old themes. It might even inspire a new generation of fourteen year olds to live life with passion and an open mind.

Sadly, this movie wasn't well acted, directed, or cut. The best acting is from ""The girl with the exposed cleavage"" and her father. (the armorer wasn't too bad either). Everyone else, including Lambert, speaks their lines in a 'more dead than talkie' fashion. The action scenes lack fluidity and imagination.

I still really enjoyed this movie, however I must say it may not be for everyone. If you are looking for something with historical value you should look else where. The core of the Beowulf story is still there but this is certainly an interpretation.

The setting of the story is quite vague, with the only reference being the Fortress. The time is rather vague as well, with things mostly being medieval yet having a few modern things thrown in. The feeling is almost post apocalyptic. The music is also very modern as well, leaning towards heavy metal.

Because of the quantity of film adaptations, it is really hard to find one that stands out from the other.  However, this one does stand out... for its pure cheesiness and stupidity.  Set in some hybrid of the medieval past and fantastic future, the movie looks like it was put together on the fly by multiple directors.  The story takes place inside a castle set somewhere in the European countryside, and everyone gets around on horses wearing armor and carrying swords, a la the medieval past.  But the warriors also have what looks like gas-powered chainsaws, which indicates something based in the 20th century.  There is blood and guts and gore, like any faithful adaptation of Beowulf should have.  There is also a lot of very fake action sequences, improbably jumps, and a monster that can vanish into thin air.  The acting is horrible; the dialogue is too scripted and reliant on one-liners.  And the swordplay is way below the par set by main actor Lambert in his Highlander films.  The only notable thing about this movie was its impact on its main actor and actress.

In some ways this film reminds more of how Hideyuki Kikuchi (creator of Vampire Hunter: D) would approach this story. A lone horseman rides in to save a town (or in this case, a castle) and much like VH:D, the story is supposed to be set ""in the distant future"" yet it looks more like a warped depiction of medieval times with no real allusions to any future technology, (also no guns, no vehicles, no electricity.) This setting was surprising and welcome, and Lambert seemed to be right at home in this world as well. The script seems okay, yet the delivery of performances from everyone else is just plain terrible. Honestly, I think that the film would be better viewed silently with subtitles as the only thing worse than the acting is the dated EBM-Industrial soundtrack. The costumes are top-notch, the CGI (at the end) is horrendous even for the time it was released.
The DVD has a ""behind the scenes"" featurette which is unfortunately about 2 minutes of candid shots and production scenes without narration with more crappy music. The only other feature is the trailer for the film.

Christopher Lambert looks pretty good still and he has one heck of a stuntman doing somersaults and other tricks to beef up the sword fight scenes.

1370949,1,B00004Y631,"Beowulf (Graham Baker, 1999)

The best thing I can say about the tragedy that is Graham Baker's ""update"" of Beowulf is that the first interminable fight scene uses, as its background music, Prodigy's remix of Front 242's ""Religion"", which was the best work that either Front 242 or Prodigy ever did. Of course, if you recognize the names Front 242 and Prodigy, you're probably wondering why either would be on the soundtrack of a movie set in the eighth century. Now you know where Brian Helgeland got at least one idea for (the not much better) A Knight's Tale.

In case you've somehow missed it for the past twelve hundred years, the plot has to do with Beowulf (in this case, played by Highlander's Christopher Lambert) coming to the aid of Hrothgar (Raindogs' Oliver Cotton) against the monster Grendel (veteran creature performer Vincent Hammond and a lot of CGI that's actually pretty decent). That, however, is where the similarity to the epic poem ends. The most striking departure, unless you're a geek like me, is the addition of Hrothgar's beautiful daughter Kyra (Doomsday's Rhona Mitra) and the inevitable love-theme subplot, this one treated as a triangle between Kyra, Beowulf, and the captain of Hrothgar's guard (Der Untergang's Gtz Otto). Also, the farther along we get, the more ridiculous (to the geeks) the plot departures get. Suffice to say Beowulf is no longer King of the Geats, but he may have another throne waiting for him...

It's everything you'd expect from a Christopher Lambert movie; the acting is atrocious, the action scenes are overwrought, the script is ridiculous. Rhona Mitra is always a welcome addition to any bad movie, but there's only so much staring one can do (and she's not always onscreen). Do yourself a favor and steer far clear of this monstrosity.

Blood, yes there will be blood, and sex thrown in for good measure, along with mysteriously supplied gas and electricity, and predator style effects for the monster.

Despite all of that, it is compelling viewing, although I tired of all of Lambert's acrobatics which were OK once but not repeated.

The science fiction channel exercised their rights to add a little censureship but not too much. Stupid dialogue with many accents did not detract too much and the special effects on the outpost were just silly.

I watched this movie expecting just what I got the usual Christopher Lambert fare, i.e. Highlander with Sean Connery.  Christopher is not known for his academy award seeking movies.  As a matter of fact the Sicilian was one of his better roles and he is not the best of actors but the supporting cast i.e. Rhona Mitra with the ""enhancements"" is eye candy for the meandering script and dialouge.  From what I understand this film is loosley based on a book based on myth and that is what I took it for.  Sword and socery and nothing more.  I guess this movie is similiar to the Kung-Fu movies that used to come on on Saturday afternoons with the flying through the air, and feats of great strength by the star performers and in that light it is an entertaining movie.  Mr Lambert was his usual monotone, quite dry self which was occasionally intrupted by a mythical beast that tore asunder warriors for no apperent reason other than they were home.  I would have given this movie 3-stars except for the very lovely Rhona Mitra whom I think is well pleasing to the eye.  For a long time she did bits in movies, i.e. the neighbor of Kevin Bacon in ""Hollow Man"" and the bounty huntress seeking to bring Riddick to justice in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" and recent brief appearances in the newly released movie ""Shooter"" starring Mark Wahlberg.  So all in all if you like sword and sorcery and a bit of a twist of a quirky movie and I apologize for almost forgetting about the lovely Patricia Valezquez in a cameo role in this movie, known more for her roles in the Mummy and Return of the Mummy with Rachel Weisz, but I digress, then you may like this one, I did because I didn't expect anymore out of it than ""Action"" and nothing more.  If you are looking for character depth and development then I suggest one of the movies I mentioned above especially the movie ""Shooter"" with Wahlberg, it is fantastic!

What Attracts A Cult Following?
1) Charismatic Hero: Christopher Lambert stars in the role of Beowulf. That will attract Highlander, The Hunt and Mortal Combat fans.
2) Hot Women: His co-star and romantic interest is gorgeous newcomer Rhona Mitra as Kyra. She is one of the sexiest actresses to appear in a fantasy adventure film since Caroline Munro graced the screen in the role of the slave girl Margiana in the '74 film, 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad'. It's worth watching just for her. (*There's also a brief appearance by ex-Playboy centerfolds' Patricia Velazquez as the ill-fated Pendra and Layla Roberts as Grendal's demonic Mother).
3) Quotability Factor: The dialogue is trite and annoyingly shallow, but contains many quotable lines such as; ""I'm not like other men"" and ""The only thing that stops me from being evil is fighting evil"". Quotability is a must for attaining cult status consideration.
4) Monster Aesthetics: Grendal is an acceptable adversary for Beowulf, but his demoness Mother (Layla Roberts) is even better.
5) Music Appreciation: 'Beowulf' contains a strong, pounding, contemporary rock soundtrack to help keep you focused.

OK for one viewing, but not much more unless you're a hardcore Lambert fan or just like looking at Rhona Mitra. On second thought, maybe a repeat viewing is in order.",1153699200,19,1524,5.165991902834008

Christopher Lambert is a flaxen hair warrior on a horse yielding a sword in a battle against a man eatting monster by the name of Grendel, which is mysteriously somehow connected to him, while Enigma crossed with the Matrix type music blasts through out the movie. Lambert plays Beowulf who comes to a place called the Outpost, where many troubles are happening, and he volunteers to kill the beast that is running on murderous rampages when night falls. He also establishes a relationship with a young widow and tackles her brother who doesn't trust him.

I'm a huge Lambert fan, he's quirky and odd but his movies are different and simply great. If you enjoy movies such as Conan, Red Sonja and fantasy costume and monster madness then this might be a great addition to your collection.

1370962,2,B00004Y631,"'Beowulf' is the hero of an old epic poem, of which name you might remember in the English literature class, (Perhaps it will be better-known thanks to Gerard Butler, who is to play the title role in the 2005 film.)  Whatever his version may be, my advice about this Christopher Lambert version is this: DON'T WATCH, if you don't want to waste your time.

How can you translate this old poem into a film, absolutely modern media?  The producers of the film thought it best to shift the setting of the story into the near future, probably post-apocalypse times, and the castle is no longer a traditional castle with a moat; it's more like a disused factory with a slight 'Mad Max' touch built in Romania.

The idea is not bad.  To this castle a tormented hero with a dark secret comes, and he is Christopher Lambert's Beowulf, perfectly equipped with gadgets like a crossbow with automatic-reloading system.  He makes his way into the castle, beating the armies surrounding the premises, and proposes to kill the monster haunting it: it's called Grendel.

Actually, so far, the film is not bad.  But suddenly it loses its steam after this promising opening.  The occasional fight with Grendel is not exciting enough, partly because poor editing and the unconvincing monster (or low-budget CGIs).  Christopher Lambert's rather one-dimentional character does not help, nor the unmemorable king Hrothger (Oliver Cotton) and his daughter (Rhona Mitra).  The dull story reminded me of 'The 13th Warrior.'  But at least 'The 13th Warrior' had an advantage of being a Kurosawa copy; in 'Beowulf,' which is a poor copy of 'Mortal Kombat,' you cannot escape from the attack of loud techno-pop soundtrack.

The only saving grace comes from the two ladies -- Rhona Mitra, the original live-action Lala Croft, and Patricia Velasquez, 'Anck Su Namun' of Brendan Fraser's 'The Mummy' series.  Yes, they are both sexy, and if you can judge a film by its being sexy or not, you may like it.",1113177600,3,1973,4.868263473053892

Take the money you were going to spend on the tape, buy a torch and a metal hanger, heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless.

1370964,3,B00004Y631,"I have read most of shakespeare's works but this one I haven't yet. For this movie that can only be a pre. Anyone who even considers any link with the original writing will be appalled by this movie. But anyone with the intelligence to read Shakespeare would be able to see in advance that this one movie has indeed nothing to do with the literature and also would be able to open their mind enough.

And if you do that there is a chance (especially if you are a not too stupid man with still too much testosterone in his blood) you may like it. The vision behind it is a erotic melting pot of weird gothic romance, unintentionally funny acrobatic fighting diverse (funny) acting archievements and a lot more. Basicly I think it was the director's wet dream version of Beowulf, and as that it is abolutely fantastic.

The modern technology in a basicly gothic setting has its appeal definately. The bodybag is totally rediculous, and so is the speaker. But the costumes are often very cool. Sell all your clicheed fake immitation Matrix outfits, this is the way to go. I am still looking for the top of the princess to give to my girlfriend. But seriously the costumes were one of the few things worth watching.

For the monsters the CGI department used some tricky ways to make what basicly looks bad have enough appeal, although I agree that the monsters are probably the least scary element of the movie. The mother in the end looked very awkward, expecting something like in Species this new body of the mother looks very unpractical to me, but in some way sexy, as is the most important element of this movie. The editing of the shots of here is terrible beyond believe, but there was probably not very much to begin with, anyway it is easy to see the whole new look of the mother was only done in CGI, and for the real action they only used images of the face with some make up, and a few props, truly B-movie style...

As an actor Christopher Lambert is theoreticly a good choice to portray the character in the story. However in reality his performance is not toitally the way we would expect. Moments of more than wooden acting intervened by moments where it looks like he couldn't manage to keep a straight face and stop having fun about where the hell he ended up as an actor are all over the movie.

The sexual fantasies about a Shakespeare play cannot be complete with a a certain amount of sexy women. The Princess as I mentioned gets all of the attention by her already mentioned outfit, but if you as a man find time to watch her face you may find moments of acting beyond what to expect from this movie. The monster's mother goes even way further, actually she is almost a parody of herself here.

So what we see here is a movie made with a vision, no mather what kind of vision or whose vision, a universe is created. Attempts to do something like that always receive recognition. I wish I could get a chance to turn one of men's literary masterpieces in an almost mindless [...] of style and vision with a slightly erotic flavour, it must have been great fun for the crew to work on this.

As a viewer, you first should really consider what this is, and hopefully this review helps on that. This kind of movie indeed deserves a few loyal followers (probably the people who also love Starship Troopers) and masses of people left hating. I myself will definately see this movie again some time, not that I love it. But it is inspriational in an artistic way and just entertaining to watch.",1104883200,,3506,4.451713395638629
1370965,2,B00004Y631,"To call this version of Beowulf mediocre wouldn't be appropriate to the level of blandness that it brings to the screen. There's relatively little to like in this post-apocalyptic recasting of the ancient poem, itself a 10th Century Christianized retelling of an even older pagan myth.

 Christopher Lambert stars (which should tell you most of what you need to know already) and does almost as a good job of acting as he did in the Highlander movies, which is to say not that well at all. To be fair, he isn't given much to work with here and neither is the rest of the cast (more on them later.) He pretty much broods around the screen with a perpetual scowl on. He's also very little like the Beowulf of legend. This version of Beowulf is an abomination (I don't want to say too much for fear of giving away the story) and is thankfully a virtual martial arts master as well. Ironically, for all of his talent he is unable to best Grendal nearly as easily as the original Beowulf who in one fight ripped the beast's arm off.

 The cast is mostly a joke. It's clear that the director felt that recasting the tale in the future would give him more possibilities. After all, in the 10th century there were few women who liked to put their men to shame by kicking more butt then they could. And they also didn't care to dress with as little clothing as possible. As hard as it might be for our culture to realize, there was a time when modesty was a virtue. Also very rare among the 10th century Danes were black men who's sole purpose was comic relief. But fear not, this movie's got that angle covered. The king is well cast and is mostly sympathetic. But he ends up being part of the largest disaster to come along in this long, sad line of disasters.

 Because see, what would Beowulf be without lots of sex? Oh wait, the original didn't have sex, you say? Eh, it should have. And this movie makes sure that you know that it's all about sex. Thankfully, we're spared most of the details but by the end (and again, I can't say too much without ruining the end) it's perfectly clear that no tale can stand up against our sex obsessed culture. Add to this a ridiculous interpretation of Grendal's mother and you're thankfully almost to the end of this garbage. As a note to those who are familiar with the poem, the movie does not cover the final third of Beowulf's story and barely manages to include a horribly mangled version of the middle third. Hollywood still seems obsessed with a ""happy"" ending and so that is what we get, albiet a shallow and absurd happy ending considering the rest of the movie.

 If techno music, overly-choreographed fights re-using the same moves several times, shallow characters, mediocre effects, and flat acting are your idea of a good time...then go and pick this movie up. Otherwise, unless you're a hardcore science fiction fan, you'll want to stay away from it. For those of us addicted to sci-fi, it's probably worth seeing once just to say you have seen it.

The movie is a futuristic retelling of the Beowulf story, and it does a half-decent job of it until the end, when it suddenly veers into an erotic horror tale. I really don't remember the Old English version having Grendel's mom as a hot blonde porn star. I also don't remember the epic being boring, filled with cliched second-scare, bad cuts between scenes, or Beowulf being such a wooden character.
The movie had two good things going for it: a great industrial soundtrack (which nonetheless doesn't go with the movie at all), and the way it's made me want to reread Beowulf, if only to clear the bad taste of this movie out of my mental palate. I haven't read it for at least ten years, and it's definitely worth the reread. It also made me remember how I want to learn Old English.  I'd love to be able to read the poem in its original language.",1084233600,5,1008,4.508196721311475
1370968,2,B00004Y631,"The epic poem that is Beowulf ranks as one of the greatest pieces of literature man has ever produced. When a reader ponders the ideas found within this wonderful work of art the mind simply boggles at the depth and richness running throughout the poem. Glimpses of the old Europe abound in this tale about Hrothgar, Beowulf, Grendel, and Grendel's mother, a Europe of drinking halls, campaigns of conquest, human destiny, and dark monsters creeping through the night. Simultaneously, a reader of Beowulf glimpses the stirrings of Christianity, which would soon overrun all of Europe and put an end to the old ways. Scholars of Beowulf never tire of writing articles and books about this piece of literature and new translations of the work continually appear. If you wish to read Beowulf, and I recommend you do so as quickly as possible, check out the spectacular Seamus Heaney translation. Do not, under any circumstances, watch this cinematic version of Beowulf in lieu of reading the poem. Not only does this movie not follow the epic in any significant way, the film also takes a decidedly B movie approach to the whole topic. ""Beowulf"" stars Z movie star Christopher Lambert as the enigmatic hero, another point you would do well to consider before popping this disc in your DVD player.
At some point in the future, in a time never elaborated upon by the filmmakers, a fortress stands watch on the borderland between good and evil. The soldiers in the fort, led by a king named Hrothgar and his right hand man Roland, fight endlessly with a mysterious creature who shambles out of the dark each night to claim a new victim. The garrison rapidly diminishes under the onslaught of this malevolent apparition until one day a man rides up to the fort claiming that his destiny involves fighting evil. This man is Beowulf, played with mind deadening woodenness by a bleach blonde Christopher Lambert. The men manning the fort are naturally suspicious of this new arrival, but after Beowulf fights the creature to a standstill the men are more accepting of his presence. In no time at all, Beowulf antagonizes Roland, wins the admiration of Hrothgar, and catches the eye of the king's busty daughter Kyra. The killings continue unabated until the big showdown between Beowulf and Grendel, the name of the being haunting the soldiers in the castle. A further surprise appears in scenes involving Hrothgar's dream encounters with a mysterious blonde apparition, a woman who has something to do with the death of the king's wife and who eventually plays a big role at the end of the film.
Initially, I warmed to ""Beowulf."" Despite Lambert in the lead role, most of the actors did a better than expected job in their roles. The gorgeous Rhona Mitra did an adequate turn playing Hrothgar's daughter. Charles Robinson, who played Mac on ""Night Court,"" does as much as he can in the role of the fort's chief weapons master, and the actors playing Hrothgar and Roland did acceptable work as well. The set pieces looked better than average for a B movie, as did the armor and weapons used by the characters. The movie starts with a nice fight scene between Beowulf and a small army outside of the fort, and this too gave me hope that the movie would rise above my original expectations. As the movie wore on, I discovered my interest waned considerably. The CGI effects used for Grendel and his mother looked cheesy and uninteresting, and Lambert's portrayal of Beowulf tended to grate after the first thirty minutes. The soundtrack contributed greatly to my sense of irritation. The filmmakers saw fit to imbue this project with a booming techno beat, and used it every chance they got whether the scene called for it or not. Sometimes this music does work, but far too often it distracts and annoys. To keep boredom at bay, I began to count how many times Beowulf executed fancy back flips during the combat sequences. In fact, it seemed that the only thing Lambert's character did after awhile was jump around, strike poses, and mutter cryptic phrases about the evil in the fort. As the final credits rolled, I knew I had just finished watching a typical B movie stinker.
The ""Beowulf"" DVD is far from a bare bones sort of release. There is a trailer for the film, along with additional trailers for films like ""Scream 3."" A short behind the scenes featurette is also available. The movie itself looks good for a low budget bomb, and you should still have a good time watching the nice looking women in this movie even if you cannot stomach the lousy dialogue or abominable special effects. ""Beowulf"" is a must see for those who get a kick out of science fiction cheese films or fans of Christopher Lambert, but all others should stay away.",1067731200,11,4735,4.76857490864799
1370969,1,B00004Y631,"I love the poem Beowulf. I've read it several times in the original verse and it is one of the greatest epics in English literature. Several years ago when I heard they were making a movie of this classic tale and that Christopher Lambert was scheduled to star as the legendary hero, I thought it was a good thing. However, I was wrong.

The only thing BEOWULF shares with the classic poem is the name of the hero, the name of the king (Hrothgar), Grendel, and Grendel's mother. That's where the similarities end.

The plot of this film is terrible. The acting is lame (Lambert does a decent job, but his character just doesn't fit in this world). The soundtrack is horrendous and feels like something out of a rave instead of a castle on the outer limits of space. The special effects aren't too bad, but considering the multi-million budget of this movie, they are rather crummy. The lighting in the movie is terrible and detracts from what little action occurs on screen. The dialogue is really bad too, but I guess the sfx budget kept the filmmakers from hiring decent writers.

Overall, BEOWULF is terrible. Not only does it rip apart a classic piece of English literature, but it's even a disgrace to the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Not recommended at all.",1052438400,,1256,4.648648648648648

It was so funny to see him flip around and beating up people in the siege at the beginning of the film.
The only things I cant say is good is first the ending. its to macho, Beowulf saves the girl and the castle explodes(!). The other is that they use bodybags, gas torches, modern food boxes and even a nightvision telescope(!) this was a bad flaw, but I just laugh about it.
Otherwise, a great and very funny classic.",1047513600,,629,4.25

The fantasy like setting is extremely well done and somehow the use of modern technology doesn't seem out of place here.

1370973,4,B00004Y631,"Anyone coming for a faithful Beowulf adaptation, or in fact anything remotely like any reasonable Hollywood film one has ever seen, is in for a real surprise.  I hope you like surprises, as I sometimes do, because after a third viewing I have to confess that _Beowulf_ is probably the best recent example I have seen of whatever passes for unintentional surrealism these days.
Plenty of people who like their genres served whole have complained that this movie looks cobbled togetther from dozens of different films, and that the parts don't sit right together.  I am compelled to agree.  Never before have I seen a medieval sci-fi horror western martial arts film with a couple of soft-core scenes thrown in for good measure.  No other movie would dare to cut from a crowd of futuristically dressed soliders carrying swords, screaming ""Kill the Beast!"", straight to Christopher Lambert in a trenchcoat on a horse, accompanied the whistle from _The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly_ on the soundtrack.  That's as cool as the unexpected intersection of a sewing machine and umbrella on some psycho future guillotine bed.
Depending on your point of view, everything is wrong or a whole lot works.  Christopher Lambert is as convincing as he ever has managed to be (I'd pay just to hear him say, ""I'm Beowulf"" a few more times), the supporting acting is all slightly off, the lead women are gorgeous, and the soundtrack--
The soundtrack deserves its own paragraph.  Ben Watkins of Juno Reactor, currently one of the best two techno outfits in the business, basically remixed a bunch of industrial and used a lot of his own stuff to create possibly the most overblown film soundtrack ever--as might be expected, given how much like a b-action film Juno Reactor's music already is.  It's less a soundtrack than an entirely separate movie which doesn't sit well along with the all this stuff from _Beowulf_ it has to accompany.  Watkins has killer techno going before the fight scenes can even really get underway, leading to the amusing audio-visual experience of hearing his music brought way down on the mix so we can hear the sounds of people walking around, looking out warily for the monster.  Not content to use everyday horror shock cues, he seems to have substituted an electric guitar for the usual ""woosh"" noises, bringing the film into the fifth dimension, without space or time, where Bernard Hermann has no meaning.

Christopher Lambert rides around on a horse and struts around in armor, while some unknown terror stalks around the basement of a castle. The castle is surrounded by more men with armor and horses, who don't want anyone to enter or leave it, although they're only moderately successful.

Now, don't mistake me, I have nothing against black people, but I wonder what two black men was doing in an European mediaval world?

Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!

Christopher Lambert does an outstanding job of portraying a tormented hero. Even better than he does in the Highlander movies. Brave, cocky and not sure of himself but sure of what he is doing. Spouting those sarcastic lines that make you laugh and the other characters step back. Set in a strange kind of future where you see modern tools like an infer red telescope along side ancient weapons (swords etc.) But not necessarily post - apocalypse.  This really sets the tone for the movie.  The viewer really has no time reference, making the movie that much more intriguing - mystical?  I loved the way the characters are played off on each other, each revealing secrets and fears.  There is much more to this movie that blood and guts, but make no mistake, violence there is plenty.

I rented this movie with the hope that the filmmakers tried to adhere to the original story from the poem.  Instead, they have attempted an update that completely falls short.  The original plot of the story is far and away the best storyline, with a larger-than-life hero with ""the grip of thirty fighting men in his hand"", fight scenes against bizarre lake creatures and a battle to the death in an underground lair with Grendal's mother.  In an attempt to ""modernize"" it, however, they have thrown out almost every good story element and ruined any chance of creating an engaging and exciting film, one that faithfully portrays the original story.  I would challenge anyone to find any translation of the poem and read it...you will understand my complete dismay once you have.  By the way, why do writers and directors (not all of them, mind you) think that for a film to work, a sex element must be present?  Sex certainly has it's place in film, to be sure, but it's use in this movie makes no sense whatsoever. In trying to follow the Amazon guidelines, I'll not recount the numerous, numerous ""problems"" in this movie as they relate to the original story; I'll just end by saying...So many missed opportunities to make a great film from a classic story.

Beowulf, in the original tale, saved people from the monsters and nobly sacrificed himself. In this moronic film, he is a sociopathic ""swiss-army-knife"" who wants us to feel sorry for him.

Actually, I recommend The 13th Warrior to any fan of medieval action or fantasy adventure. My endorsement of Beowulf doesn't go NEARLY as far, and yet somehow, in spite of its many glaring flaws, I find this ""adaptation"" quite entertaining.
This straight-to-video year 2000 take on the ancient tale stars Christopher Lambert as the superhuman hero Beowulf, except this isn't the Dark Ages. Instead, the events take place in a post-apocalyptic future of gears and steaming pipes (a setting that, I feel, was a mistake). It has Hrothgar the ""Border Lord,"" Grendel, and Grendel's mother, but everything else from the poem is absent, and here the similarities begin to wane. As movies go, this is Fortress meets Mortal Kombat (both of which starred Lambert) meets Mad Max, and thrown somewhere in the middle of this techno-gothic realm is Beowulf. Beowulf himself has become a high-flying martial artist (thanks to Lambert's stand-in, naturally); Grendel's mother has become a sexy porn star succubus who seduces Hrothgar in his dreams; and Grendel is your typical B-movie creature with some purple haze surrounding him at all times to make the costume seem more imposing (and, point of fact, it does make the man in a monster suit beastie seem less like what it actually is).
Not unlike the old fantasy flick The Sword and the Sorcerer, Beowulf still manages to be fun in spite of its many failings and sometimes laughable production values (not to mention laughable acting). I still haven't managed to grasp how it can equal more than the sum of its parts, but if you don't expect a film version of the old epic and instead expect a second-rate Lambert action flick, you might have fun also.

I had high expectations, and as the movie is very disappointing I can not give it more  than 2 stars. The dialogues are poor, there is no depth anywhere in the film, the music  is awfully terrible and ugly (pop / techno...), the ugly fighters (their look, etc.) do not belong to the dark  ages or the Medieval times but to Mad Max, the castle (seen on the skyline) looks like  a crazy, top-down castle (should I say postmodern, or  la Picasso?) the mother of the  monster really acts like a porn-star (I really thought I was watching a porn-movie during  the sex sequences), etc. all cheap stuff poorly combined together.
And the mythic, religious, metaphysical dimension of the tale is not explored, not given  any depth in the film. Think by contrast of the richness with which John Boorman  expresses the pagan worldview in Excalibur (e. g. when Arthur sees insects moving on  the earth while Merlin sleeps, etc. to illustrate the pagan view that the Earth has a soul) (and Excalibur had gorgious music, Wagner and Orff's Carmina Burana, etc.) By  contrast to Excalibur, the materialist version of the Arthurian legend (the one  featuring Sean Connery, I even forgot the name of the movie) is very poor, no match.  But here we have the opposite : the mythical version (Beowulf), which should have  been very rich, is much below the materialist version, Crichton's The 13th Warrior, (where the monster turns out to be no monster, but man-made) which, inspite of its poor editing, is still much more enjoyable (but also bloody) than  Beowulf.
And I even much prefer Disney's great viking movie for children, Stevenson's The  Island at the Top of the World to a film like this Beowulf. Do not expect here more than  one of those (cheap) B-movies that feature  a monster, or you may be very  disappointed as I am.

There isn't much to this movie, other than bad techno music, a porn star, and a bunch of technology that didn't fit anywhere in history except the late 19th century.  The only thing the movie appears to share with the epic Beowulf is the name, and a faint storyline of a half mortal, half god being coming to destroy a creature that's wrecking havoc on a castle.
I love Christopher Lambert, but this movie did not do justice to his acting skills. He doesn't have any lines that are worth remembering, the movie doesn't do much to develop his character, and for being half human, half god he's surprisingly vulnerable.  There's a short (five minutes or less) amount of time given to why he's half human, half god, and why he's there to defeat the Grendal.
The rest of the characters are pretty flat, even Kyra (Rhona Mitra) and Grendal's Mother (Layla Roberts).  There isn't anything special about either of the them, and the only thing Layla Roberts brings to the film are a few dream sequences where she gets to act sexy and porn star like, and Rhona Mitra really doesn't add anything.
Beowulf really turned out to be a pretty one-dimensional movie, with a lot of bad techno that really didn't fit.  Add in one porn star, some technology that's centuries before it's time, lots of people who haven't been in a lot of well known movies, and some sword fighting, and you have a step below B grade movie.",989107200,4,1590,4.4878892733564015
1370995,1,B00004Y631,"Wow. I really didn't know they made movies this bad. While Lambert has been known to star in a few clunkers this one has to take the cake. The script is just the pits, the soundtrack is an incessant techno-type music that seems out of place, the setting is terribly unconvincing, and the actors (to the extent that they can act) are worse than just about anything I've ever seen.
Avoid this film unless you are a connoisseur of bad movies. Otherwise, it'll subtract at least 5 points from your IQ.",981590400,,497,4.472527472527473
1370996,1,B00004Y631,"After reading Beowulf I was curious how this great epic could be translated into other genres.  Part of what makes the poem great is its language.  It's chant-like use of alliteration, caesura and compound wording makes it beautifully nuanced reading.  Moreover, the story itself has all the essential parts and themes to keep the reader intrigued.  The film adaptation, however, had none of this.
I was very disappointed to find that besides ignoring all of the above, the movie created such ludicrous plot twists as a weakly contrived love interest and far fetched psychological melodrama.  To treat this fundamentally christian-pagan poem this way is near sacrilige.",981158400,5,669,5.273584905660377
1370997,2,B00004Y631,"This movie promises a lot - a story arround a classic legend, one of the best actors up to date and a nice fantasy flair. What you get is different. The fact that the creators of the Mortal Kombat Movie did this picture says already a lot.  What you get is a superficial techno fantasy movie with a silly story, boring acting, trashy tekkno music, cheap special effects and Christopher Lambert, yet in one of his worst roles cause the plot doesn't give him any chance to show up his great acting abilities or even just his charme (in beowulf everything he says sounds boring and that's not his fault, it's cause the dialogues are very flat). All that makes you feel like watching a mix of that hercules tv series and the mortal kombat movies. There is no point in wasting money on that one. Those who like simple entertainment should better watch Hercules or Xena on TV for free and Lambert adorers can save their money here and buy the great new ""Ressurection"" where you get that great acting again that made him so famous. You may noticed that i gave 2 stars still - well, Lamberts appearance is at least worth one even though he could do a lot better and the second star is for the dvd menue & extras - they did better work on that as on the whole movie.",980467200,7,1257,4.326271186440678

Not so good: ALL of the fight scenes in a movie of this type should have been good; the ""backflips"" during some fights were excessive. Lambert is not as nimble as he used to be and it shows.",973468800,,282,4.339622641509434
1371000,1,B00004Y631,"I rented this film knowing it would have nothing to do with Beowulf, the book. In fact, I rented it expecting very little, except for maybe a couple good action scenes and some Rhona Mitra cheesecake. There's one passable action scene in the first few minutes, and Rhona Mitra is appealing in her low-cut leather bodice, but she doesn't really do anything in the movie, and frankly, neither does anyone else. This movie is ten minutes of excitement jam-packed into two hours. It's not really ""funny bad"" in a B-movie way, and it's not really interesting on any other level. The biggest laugh you will get out of this flick is the ""Mortal Kombat"" rip-off opening credits. If you're looking for a cheesy B-movie to watch, re-rent an old favorite and don't waste your time with this one.",972777600,2,784,4.688405797101449

Ham is seriously in the fist, beating you 3-ways to Sunday and all I can do is whisper, please, sir; can I have some more?"" I love Christopher Lambert. So stoic, serious and sarcastic. More back flips in a climactic fight scene, than I have ever seen in another movie. This is B- movie GOLD!!!! Other movies like it, if you want to compare or watch something else.
