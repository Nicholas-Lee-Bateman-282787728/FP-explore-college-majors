8361715,1,B001CCY452,I love horror movies.  I love good B-movies.  This is neither.  The fact that it was made in 1990 and wasn't released until 2009 should say something.  I was hoping it would have been so bad it was entertaining but it was just bad.,1525046400,,231,4.181818181818182
8361716,1,B001CCY452,"I watched this movie four years ago and I've rewatched parts since. It is without a doubt one of the unfunniest, most miserable endurance tests ever put to the medium of film.

The jokes ALL fall flat. The kills are boring and drab. Everything plays out like an after school special shot on a budget of $8.

If you are still intrigued and want to watch this, please do it for free. NEVER spend your money on it.",1523577600,,411,4.256410256410256
8361717,5,B001CCY452,"Right from the opening credits animation and the shameless rip off of YELLO's hit ""Oh Yea""  you know you're in for something special. Yes, here we have another lost anomaly from the end of the 80s, beginning of the 90s big haired era. Just get drunk or high, watch it with friends (also drunk or high) at 2am and you'll see the insanely brilliant humor in it all. Worth every penny of your purchase",1523059200,,398,4.378378378378378
8361718,4,B001CCY452,"I think this might have been Fred Travalenas only feature lead role and its great to see him here.  Fun early 90s horror slasher comedy, reminded me of Student Bodies.",1522972800,,167,4.566666666666666
8361719,4,B001CCY452,"Now, you might be looking at my 4 star rating and wondering just what exactly that's based on.  The acting is sub par.  The story is ridiculous and barely held together.  The cinematography leaves something to be desired.  And a laundry list of other offences.  What this movie DOES have going for it is heart.  If you love terrible movies, Night of the Dribbler will deliver.",1519516800,,376,4.621212121212121
8361720,2,B001CCY452,"Trusting the Code Red label; we pre-ordered this disk without knowing too much about the film. Of course; when it arrived - we eagerly popped it in - looking to find a horror comedy. What we instead received was a really poor spoof, with no gore and really no decent sight gags. Think of ""Saturday the 14th Strikes Back"" (but maybe worse).

The only reason it gets 2 stars for the obscurity of the material on the disk; and the fact they attempted to make it the best product possible (though the washed-out full frame transfer leaves quite a bit to be desired; we believe it's due to the age and rarity of the print).

Our advice: RENT IT (if really curious)",1268006400,,659,4.39344262295082
8361721,1,B001CCY452,"I would rate it zero stars but Amazon don't give you that option, DONT BUY IT,Slow very slow and just plain stupid!!! I see why it was never released, If you are looking for a slasher flick its not one, Its the worst attempt of a comedy that i have ever viewed. The jokes are plain stupid. Words cant describe how bad it is, It felt like ever watching this film, Code red i hope you only pressed a few hundred of thses because it should go back into the vault. You are gonna lose money putting out garbadge like this, Put out NIGHTMARES IN A DAMAGED BRAIN and DEATH WEEKEND, People want these titles, Not goofy films like this.",1255737600,5,627,4.233333333333333
