8557678,1,B00008R9KY,"BY FAR the cheapest horror film I have seen.  MUST be on digital video.  It was so bad that I did not figure out it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy til half way through it! I just thought the acting was really bad.. either way, the acting was bad.
The actresses were supposed to be babes-FAR from it.  Infact, the blonde who always showed her cleavage and stomach was CHUBBY!
BAD acting, stupid ending!!!
They should have saved their money and had a nice dinner somewhere instead.",1073088000,,476,4.386363636363637
