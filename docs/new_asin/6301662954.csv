341962,5,6301662954,"Robert Mitchum and Kurt Jurgens are magnificent as dueling captains in this superb tale of WWII rivals in the South Atlantic. Until Das Boot, this was, in my estimation, the #1 submarine flick of all time. David Hedison and Theodore Bikel add lustre to a fine cast. Great special effects and direction. This is one of my all-time faves and it is a valued addition to my video library. I recommend this one highly! If you've never seen it, you're in for a treat.",990230400,,461,4.5
341963,5,6301662954,"Even if you have seen the Star Trek episode, this is still a great movie.  I only wish the video were available in widescreen.",985651200,,126,4.25
341964,5,6301662954,"Taut, tense saga of war at sea, with superb performances from a veteran cast.  This film shows how much more can be accomplished with actors, script, and direction, than with over-reliance on the hi-tech special effects which often drown contemporary movies. Of its genre, ""The Enemy Below"" is simply, The Best.  Highly recommended.",976060800,3,332,5.245283018867925
341965,5,6301662954,"This movie is about the conflict between an American destroyer commander and a veteran U-boat commander in the southern Atlantic. While the U-boat  commander's only goal is to carry out his orders and get back home,  Mitchum's only goal is to track and kill the U-boat.
There are top-notch  performances throughout this movie. It gives, I believe, a representative  view of the German and American views of the latter part of the Battle for  the Atlantic.
All the U-boat crews wanted to do in the latter part of the  war was to survive, and all the allied surface fleet wanted to do was to  smash the U-boat arm that had wreaked so much havoc earlier it the  war.
If you like war movies in general, and sub movies in particular,  don't miss this movie!

341967,5,6301662954,"Spectacular sea saga where you can't always tell the cat from the mouse.  Mitchum puts in a stellar performance as a destroyer captain who chases a career-strong but weary U-Boat captain.  One of the best WWII movies  Hollywood ever produced -- tightly edited, well paced, with only a couple  of obvious cliche' scenes.  (Watch for the scene where the U-Boat captain  confronts a panicky crewman wielding a large wrench.)",911692800,2,421,5.028985507246377

342022,5,6301662954,"""THE ENEMY BELOW"" was an outstanding war drama and the finest of its kind, between the United Artists release, ""RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP"" and others, this was just an amazing movie! released by Twentieth Century Fox in 1957, the movie was a superior production that also featured the terrific special effects of L.B. Abbott shortly before working with Irwin Allen on the Fox TV shows of the 1960s, as well as working on the Academy Award-winning FX in 1966's ""FANTASTIC VOYAGE"" and the 1970 release, ""TORA, TORA, TORA!"" the movie, starring Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens was a terrific and involving adventure as a US Destroyer stalks and tries to hunt down the German U-Boat in the North Atlantic. LB Abbott's great miniatures and underwater shots were just breathtaking and creatively challenging! director Richard Powell knew his work as well as choosing a superior cast, one of which was played by Al Hedison, who later became known as David Hedison, who worked on Fox's ""THE FLY"" movie in 1958 and later co-starred with Richard Basehart on ABC's ""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"" series in 1964. In another interesting coincidence, a 1966 episode of that series called ""The Enemies"" had used the majority of stock footage from ""THE ENEMY BELOW"", since both materials were produced by Twentieth Century Fox.  ""THE ENEMY BELOW"" was first nationally aired by NBC in 1963. back in the late 60s and mid-1970s, much of Twentieth Century Fox's film library was syndicated on TV and owned and distributed by what was then called Warner Bros./Seven Arts in those days before the corporate re-acquiring of studio assets by the 80s and 90s. all trivial put aside, this movie is a great thrill ride for viewers and consumers who understand the material from a time when quality and creativity walked hand in hand, and especially for Robert Mitchum fans who loved his work in those days!  an episode of ""STAR TREK"" in 1966 called ""Balance Of Terror""  was also inspired by this movie, so you know that this movie was and is still worth its weight in gold! worth the buy, especially on BluRay!",1516492800,,2080,4.820728291316526

342025,5,6301662954,Pretty good World War II movie with Robert Mitchum as u.s. Navy captain trying to kill a German sub. The movie tells a story from both the German side and the US side as the two captains try to outwit each other. It's pretty tense along the way and quite plausible although it's doubtful that anything like this ever actually happened as described in the movie. Still it's good entertainment. I think part of the reason it's good is because it just shows the futility of War,1513123200,,474,4.459770114942529

I hope not to spoil it, but love the exchange at the end when the German Commander says, ""I should have died many times, but this time it was your fault."" To which Mitchum replys, ""Oh, I didn't know that, maybe I won't next time.""  And Jurgens says, ""I think you will.""  Great acting, very believable and realistic.

342054,5,6301662954,"During World Was II a U-boat and a destroyer are in a cat-and-mouse situation to the end. The question is who the cat is and who is the mouse? They use standard clichs and extraordinary tactics; however there is not need for anything supernatural or far fetched to hold your attention. It is a battle of wits and wills between the Commanders of both vessels. We are there as they both sweat out time or take chances.

For the most part everyone is speaking English so you will not have to strain your eyes to read the small print at the bottom of the screen. Being made before CGI we will watch some battles and scenes made with the use of models.

Yes you have seen this story portrayed again in such classics as ""Das Boot"" (1982). What is more interesting is even the same dialog is played out in the movie ""Star Trek II - The wrath of Kahn"" (1982)

342075,5,6301662954,"Robert Mitchum  and Curt Jurgens give  excellent performances in this underrated classic.  Mitchum is the Captain of a destroyer following a German U-boat in the Atlantic off the southern Caribbean Sea.  In almost all submarine movies, there is the tension within a ship about the commanding officer.  While there is some talk at the beginning of both missions, that is done away quickly and the rest of the film is the cat and mouse game that the two captains play, one trying to reach a rendezvous point and must shake off his American adversary, the other hoping that help will arrive.  This was Dick Powell's first movie directing effort and he proved he could have been one of the greats (had he not been under contract with Howard Hughes).
There is one scene that seems to me to embody the natural feel to this movie.  Two sailors on the destroyer are talking, with their fishing poles hung out over the edge of the ship.  As they talk the camera follows the fishing lines down into the submarine where casual talk is going on by the Captain and his crew.  The final action scene is based on an actual event.  And the ending is uplifting, rather than the usual victory cheering.",1500076800,2,1184,4.595238095238095

Robert Mitchum plays a naval captain in the South Atlantic. After having lost his previous ship and forced to survive for weeks in the ocean, he's given another assignment due to the navy in desperate need of ship captains with combat experience.

Curt Jurgens is the German sub commander on mission to collect a code book from a German raider. His sub gets spotted by Mitchum's ship and the hunt is on! Mitchum has an advantage with the latest underwater detection, but Jurgens is a captain with experience from the 'old school' and makes the chase tough. The films shows friendships from both sides and it's good to see how the German characters despise the Fuhrer like so many actually did.

342202,1,6301662954,"I cant believe how badly the transfer of this great movie into Blu Ray was.  I had been waiting for this movie to be on Blu Ray, now it is and Kino Lorber totally messed it up.  My copy of the DVD is far greater in any aspectpicture, clarify, sound, you name it.  And oh my DVD also has subtitle options.  Speaking of subtitles, I am beginning to notice, Kino Lorber is starting to remove subtitles on all their newly released classic Blu Rays.  I used to complain about another company, Olive Films.  This Olive company produces crystal clear Blu Ray transfers but they never ever had subtitles on the Blu Ray films and a lot of people were complaining about it.  Until recently they probably heard peoples complains, Olive starting to add subtitles on their Blu Rays.  Kino Lorber on the other hand, just about all their Blu Ray transfers are substandard to most company even from certain DVD copiesand now they are also removing their subtitles and their titles are also very expensive.  Everytime I see an old title favorite is announced to be released in Blu Ray by Kino LorberI always say, why does it have to be them?  Why cant be Shout Company or Olive Films since they now include subtitles or other companies, but not Kino Lorber?  Whats so bad is that KL get to transfer into Blu Rays most old favorite movies.  I would really love to see Enemy Below blu ray transfer from Criterion or Shout or Twilight.  Ah probably not in this lifetime.",1476403200,19,1450,4.509578544061303

The transfer suffers from fuzzy imagery (only partially disguised by edge enhancement) and damage to the source elements
(particularly noticeable in the opening credits) and it rather looks like it has been poorly scanned from a release print.

I was able to do a direct comparison with a version saved on my Sky+HD box and the latter is vastly superior in video quality.

Stars: 4.5

Pros:
-Main cast is perfect
-I was on the edge of my seat (before hollywood had a formula)
-Focused on humanity over politics without trying to support a specific political agenda (almost unheard of nowdays)

Cons:
-The supporting cast is under developed and a little weak

342583,5,6301662954,"I see a number of other great reviews have already been written on this film. I agree with all of the film's good points, as it was very well researched as far as US destroyer and German U-Boat tactics.

But my real $0.02 is my relief at seeing there was thankfully a minimum of sappy, unrealistic self-hatred on the part of the German characters. Was there a line devoted to it here and there? Yes. Jurgens character -- during a lull in the action -- speaks with a confidant words to the effect of how ""there was somehow honor in fighting WWI, but not WWII."" Um, what? Also, during one of the waves of depth charges launched by the US destroyer, Jurgens rolls his eyes at one of his subordinates who is reading ""Mein Kampf.""

I've spoken with numerous Kriegsmarines and members of the Heer and overall Wehrmacht and NOT ONCE did any of them express some embarrassment in serving their country. Instead, they were proud of their service, especially in light of the political realities that have come to light about how WWII was manipulated by servants like Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. So why does hollywood always attempt to make Germans look either outright evil, or embarrassed to serve their country? That's honestly my only gripe with this film and thankfully, these aspects were minimal, unlike ""Morituri,"" which was ruined by its zionist political undercurrent.",1463356800,,1372,4.809322033898305

342668,5,6301662954,"I found this movie very engaging not in a war action movie kind of a way, but introspectively drawn by the motives that lead to each and next strategic decision by two commanders of a submarine and naval warship -- the U.S. commander who has a past that gives him more of a motive to redeem himself and his lost wife, and a over seasoned German commander who knows that the days of Hitler will soon be over, and ready to desert. Interesting that as Russians you would be defecting, while as Germans you would be deserting.  First scenes of their gear in comparison seems more outdated than the U.S., and as a U-boat, smaller, the commanders are clear of the SWOT analysis in order to remain afloat and alive, as well as their duty for their boat and ship.  If the General trained into WW2 is himself from a 3rd generation Prussian deserter who remained in the U.S., I'm sure that would have been more a pondering for the German soldiers to wonder if their lives in America would be preferable or realized if that General will also later become the President during Korean War to administer until 1960, the main agenda being highways and roads in America. ... President Eisenhower. As they are using and recalling from their experience from an initial entry and attack and rebound by a U-Boat, I love their thoughts and conversation they convey, as they slowly resort to the last of what they can give and execute and command as their loyal duty to their fellow soldiers, for their country in a state at a later time in warfare, and why the U.S. commander of a burning ship would help the commander of a U-Boat. Very fascinating to watch the two trying to figure how the other will move and maneuver through each attack and rebound from a warship and one a sub U-boat, the risks they take as well as their crew and watching their reactions, and why a U.S. commander feels that way toward his opponent at the end, almost as if to say thank you, as we're all alive, and I don't know if at a certain point you just let it go to our advantage.

I went on to serve in the US Navy for six years and on the same ship, a Knox class ASW Frigate (USS Miller, FF-1091) for four and a half years.

Great movie to watch over and over.",1455753600,,521,4.591397849462366
342925,4,6301662954,"I had never heard of this film before, until I was reading an article about a Star Trek episode: ""Balance of Terror."" I love that particular episode - and as it were, for the same reasons I love this film. When I found out the inspiration for the ST episode, I finally was able to track down a copy of ""The Enemy Below"" to view (as well as seeing it on TCM a few times, I believe).

Like many great films set during war-time, this is more than a run of the mill bang-bang, shoot-'em-up battle-sequence. It examines the people involved in such action - putting a human face on war. and giving some insight into the psychological effects of battle. I would say, in terms of action, it would be between ""Mister Roberts"" and the earlier mentioned ""The Longest Day.""

Basically it's a deadly chess game with the various moves taken by two ships being countered almost perfectly by the opponent. And, though the crews may not know the reasoning behind each counter-move, a logical (I'm not sure about accuracy, but it sounded good) explanation normally is given - after the fact. Though casualties occur, such is the sad aspect of warfare. The important thing is each Captain is first and foremost aiming to complete his mission: The U-Boat to reach a rendezvous point, the Destroyer (having detected the U-Boat) attempting to prevent that by pursuing the enemy.

I have slowly become a Robert Mitchum fan. Though I really never thought of him in the same category as bigger name actors, every once in a while I've caught his performance (generally in a supporting role). I think the first time I really started to 'catch the bug' was seeing him in ""The Longest Day."" From that point on, I've really started to enjoy and appreciate his style. In this film, I love how Mitchum finally makes his appearance - disproving the crew's feeling that, being a new commander, he has no idea what to do. The way he calmly goes about making decisions which could easily result in their destruction - or 'losing' the scent of it's prey - is marvelous. Mitchum just projects what my idea of a military commander should look and sound like.

His counterpart, Curt Jrgens, is likewise a quite capable commander - doing his best to complete his mission, but ultimately reaching a point where confrontation is required. I personally enjoy how the film tries to show the difference between German military members, and flat-out Nazi sympathizers/proponents. Much like the Luftwaffe commander of the POW camp in ""The Great Escape.""

Bottom line: this is a very good military film - it has a nice mix of personal stories and backgrounds, battle scenes (as much as you can show between a surface ship and a U-Boat), and the concept of military strategy - an aspect not often shown at this level (the closest probably being some of the scenes in ""Patton"").",1455753600,7,2827,4.691532258064516

Showing two honorable captains and honorable crews, it presented the drama and life aboard a destroyer and uboat. Both captains and their crew were presented with their human side showing. The movie stayed focused on the drama between the two men, presenting the stress on both sides without getting overly sidetracked with wacky events. The movie presents the fog of war without cursing and gratuitous blood and gore found in many modern movies. This is one the older kids can watch.

343297,5,6301662954,"This is a really excellent movie about a fictional encounter between an American destroyer and a German submarine.  The movie depicts a ""chess match"" type encounter between the two captains.  The movie stars Robert Mitchum.  It is directed by Dick Powell.  It is one of my personal favorite movies about World War II.

The movie is based on a novel authored by a British author who was an actual British naval officer in charge of escorting shipping in World War II.  The novel depicts a British warship and crew in a similar encounter with a German submarine.  The novel is food, not great.  Generally I like books bette than the movies that are hey inspire.

Casting is top notch, Robert Mitchum as the cool, confident destroyer commander and Curt Jurgens as the hardened U-Boat commander who is anti-Nazi and probably a Christian as well.

The storyline was also used on a Star Trek episode (the Balance of Terror).",1447718400,,332,4.741379310344827
343652,4,6301662954,"In 1957 WWII was still fresh in the consciousness of the country and Hollywood was busy cranking out flicks to capitalize on that. This is one of the better I've seen.

Here's the scoop. Robert Mitchum Captains a ship in the South Atlantic while Curd Jurgens captains a U-Boat in the same stretch of sea and seems to be on a mission. Each gets wind of the other and the game is on as to who will prevail in the meeting.

This is a generally decent flick. Director Dick Powell was known more for his acting than directing. He directed 6 films, most of this quality. I found his handling a bit clunky as was some of the dialogue. What is happening here is the cat and mouse game played by the two captains. Mitchum, for the most part seems to have a better bead on Jurgens than vice versa. He doesn't though, short change Jurgens. He considers him a worthy and dangerous opponent. It isn't until the final act that Jurgens sees the one possible link in Mitchum's armor and acts on it. Another thing happening here is that the Germans are not portrayed as two dimensional evil-doers. You spend as much time with them as with the Americans. They are real human beings. And they are shown respect by the Americans as well when they go out of their way to rescue the German survivors, and risk their lives to rescue Mitchum along with Jurgens and his next in command.

Again, this suffers a bit in a few areas but its strong points more than make up for it. If you're a fan of WII cinema, have at it.",1447718400,,1494,4.309608540925267

There is a homage (french for ripoff?) to the movie in a Star Trek episode involving Kirk and a Romulan commander in a shielded Warbird. An interesting aside is that one of the co-stars was a young David Hedison who found some fame later on TV as another submarine 1st officer in ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"".

343954,3,6301662954,"As of 2015 (close to 60 years after this feature was released): 600 reviews.  Amazing, especially when the movie is--at this point--somewhat dated and quite ""typical"" of the late-50s hollywood war movie (meaning, fairly predictable.)  The original story--a British novel written by an English WW II naval officer--was a lot more hard-edged (in the climax, when seamen of both sides share a lifeboat, the Brit Captain takes a swing at the U-boat Captain).  However, Dick Powell made the movie during the Cold War era and Germany was a good ally, hard up against Russia's Iron Curtain and so there's a brothers-in-arms ""respectful adversary"" feeling at the end.

Dated, too, are the Oscar-winning special effects, with the (predictable) miniatures and rear-screen projection use during final combat scenes.  No matter how clever the effects are (and they are) they just couldn't fake water, resulting in drops of water that are as big as...well, one of those three-inch guns mounted on the little destroyer escort.

Excellent performance by Hollywood newcomer Curt Jurgens in his first screen appearance, as the U-boat skipper, and a solid one by Robert Mitchum as the American commander.",1440979200,,1186,5.248677248677248

344046,4,6301662954,"All I'm doing is piggy-backing them reviewers what already gave this movie a scintillating push. There is Das Boot, and that's untouchable when it comes to the best submarine films. There's Crimson Tide, and also The Hunt for Red October. And, then, there's 1957's The Enemy Below, a WWII picture from 20th Century Fox in which a U.S. naval destroyer squares off against a German U-boat in the South Atlantic. What we get is a taut chess match between the two opposing commanders, terrifically played by Robert Mitchum and Curt Jrgens. Once-crooner, once-hard-boiled-detective, now director and producer Dick Powell helms a fine character study of combatants from both sides of the war, and the toll it takes, and the tight camaraderie that builds, and how, in the best of men, disillusionment doesn't mean one reneges on one's sense of duty or honor. Jrgens cuts a truly sympathetic figure, while Mitchum proves that he's far from being a ""feather merchant."" Now dated, The Enemy Below, nevertheless, offers a suspenseful plot, great acting, and inventive shots from Powell. And just to add that extra bit of verisimilitude, the real-life sailors of the USS Whitehurst - the ship that doubled as Mitchum's destroyer - participated in many of the scenes and played background characters like the gun & depth charge crews and the communication staff. Lt. Commander Walter Smith, who was the commanding officer of the USS Whitehurst, played Mitchum's engineering officer. He's the guy reading the Little Orphan Annie comic book. One last thing, The Enemy Below also inspired one of my favorite Star Trek episodes, ""Balance of Terror."" So, yeah, maybe I'm biased for this submarine flick.",1433721600,,1685,5.108695652173913

I remember a lot of movies by how kids talked about them on the playground of Crestview Elementary on the Air Force base I grew up on. The Enemy Below had shown on TV the night before and the talk was enthusiastic; the smell of sea spray and depth charge timing fuses is strong in this one. Robert Mitchum plays a wise, patient but untried wartime captain of a Navy destroyer. Slithering through the dark waters below is a German sub, trying to escape him but committed to a course that will fulfull his mission. Mitchems hunter is relentless and reveals experience far above what even his crew expected of him as he outwits and out maneuvers Kurt Jergens sub driver. Deep underwater, Jergens has ghosts he cant outrun. For one, being a Nazi , he says, has damned them all. We will meet death without God, he mourns.  But even as he runs out of torpedos and calculates how much air is left aboard his ship, up top Mitchum knows he will take advantage of any lapse of judgement and the German will send him to the bottom -- and nearly does, right to the end.

There is a great moment when, waiting for word on the missing sub,  a sailor hangs a fishing line over the side. Director Dick Powell has the camera follow the line, dipping beneath the waves to the dangled hook, then tilting straight down to see the submarine lurking below. One of many bravura moments of unexpected technique in a movie filled with them.  Taut action is absorbing and never lets a boring moment down the hatch as one by one, good men crackup, get injured, or die during two hours of one upmanship between sea captains. No time is wasted on scenes of claustophobia orsailor's boredom; this is an all-out sea battle movie beautifully performed, filmed and directed start to finish. Movies like this really find my soft spot; a major Periscopes Up! from the schoolyard.",1429228800,,1896,4.5

The film accurately portrays life aboard a destroyer escort in WWII. It's very detailed, right down to the men wearing sailor hats that had been dyed blue. My dad was a WWII ""tin can"" sailor and he once mentioned that the first order that they heard piped over the ship's PA system when they went aboard their ship at the Charleston Navy Yard in 1943 was to ""lay aft for hat dying"", a simple task intended to hide the dirt and grime the sailors faced in the course of their everyday work.

Nobody built U-boat sets until ""Das Boot"" which is now the standard, deservedly so.

This was one of his favorite movies, and it immediately became one of my favorite movies.  Just last month I finally bought the book and read it, and it, too, was every bit as good.  Having that as the source, it's no wonder they were able to make such a great movie.

Kurt (or Curt, depending on the source) Jurgens was phenomenal as the German submarine commander.  He exuded that war weary captain angst perfectly.  He looked the part, and every line he delivered was spot on.  Robert Mitchum was equally excellent as the American destroyer commander.  He had even broken his back during the filming and kept on filming.

The story of hunter and hunted is very well done.  They keep switching from one aspect to another, from destroyer to sub, and you get to see the offensive and defensive moves from both, reacting to what the other is doing.  Amazingly enough, they really kept to the original book quite a bit.

The cinematography is outstanding, especially considering what year this was made.  And because of the year, it has an immediate, visceral feel to it because you know it's not all CGI and green screens.  The Navy did a great job working with the filmmakers.

If you're at all a fan of naval warfare, or World War II, this movie should absolutely be in your collection.",1414972800,2,1379,4.548780487804878

Interesting note, the film score was composed by Leigh Harline who also wrote ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" for the Disney people.

Also recommended is Das Boot which also stars Kurt Jurgens. You can watch that in either German with English subtitles or the dubbed English. It makes little difference if you get the right version because both Jerguns and the other main character spoke excellent English and years after the movie first came out they went in and dubbed in their own lines so they are actually speaking the English translations.",1406851200,,697,4.620967741935484

344387,5,6301662954,"This is a really excellent post-war film: stirring, smartly written, fast story line, lots of action, and compelling characters. Sure, it might be a little predictable in the big picture sense: not in the maneuvering or tactics -- no, I think a Navy man (especially those in ships such as these) might gain an advantage there. But it's predictable in that you pretty much could guess where this was going, and what ""ground"" this movie might tread upon by the end. But it's like one of those great old war movies, or more modern fare like those who enjoyed the terrific Captain Kirk Star Trek TV episodes where his ship was in the battle of their lives -- and those who liked that old original series know what I'm talking about. While we have every expectation Kirk will win, the joy of watching is in the dynamics of combat: tactics, intrigue, ingenuity, training, experience, and brotherhood.

And speaking of brotherhood, the movie was made 12 years after the war ended, and the movie industry was aware that we had entered a phase of reconciliation. Sure, we had a lot of anger at an enemy who had plunged the world into an inhuman war. But we were also mending fences, and this movie concentrated not only on the two opposing ship captains, but it also showed us several times that the German captain was no Nazi, and he in fact HATED Nazis and their poisonous mentality.

What was really fun to watch was the intelligent battle, the shrewdness of two heads of ship who knew the ropes and were at the top of their games, like two experienced boxers circling the ring waiting for the other to make a mistake. Robert Mitchum is so good in this role you have to think that he was made for them...I think men would follow him into battle just because he was Robert Mitchum, with that great leader's face: keen eyes, weary long face and demeanor, and a deep, sonorous voice that inspired but also let you know he understood it all. On the German side, Curt Jergens played his role perfectly too: tired of war, feeling his time had passed, knowing that his own children died in war and he had nothing to go back to.

But it's the cat-and-mouse game that we're put through that makes the film: both sides were well matched, and the film hardly focused on anything else. From almost the opening credits to the end credits there was barely time for the briefest of exposition to bring you up to speed to let you know who the key players were, and then it's, BOOM! you're in the fight.

This is a great movie that people who understand that battles are fought by men, not machines, and no one side has it all. If you're interested in a fast 100 minutes spent leaning forward out of your chair you can't go wrong here.",1405900800,,2712,4.483805668016195

Kurt Jergens is awesome as the German sub commander. It is one of the few made with TECHNICOLOR and in ""CINEMASCOPE."" Friends say...well why not watch The Hunt of Red October or Crimson Tide?  I reply...those are NOT WW2 movies but cold war movies. Nothing really happens in those. Plus comparing subs is like comparing new vs old cars! Yes they are better today in terms of performance. But are they in terms of cool?  WW2 Subs to me were way cooler because they were more manual control and not all computerized like todays massive monstrosities. Sorry but I'm more entertained watching a Balao class WW2 pink sub in ""Operation Petticoat"" than a drama like the cold war sub movies. Why?  Because the subs in WW2 actually attacked and fired torpedoes.  Das Boot is awesome.",1397692800,,932,4.562874251497006

Robert Mitchum is outstanding as the ""feather-merchant"" who does battle with a U-boat. Curt Jergens, as always, plays a German to a tee!! The other performance that immediately comes to mind is in The Longest Day. Many do now realize that during WWII Curt Jergens was actually a POW of the Nazi's. Ironic that he then went on to mostly portray Nazi's in his movie roles. I just love Mitchum's performance in this movie. He commands the screen and all your attention.

You are never quite sure who is chasing who but it is a very interesting look at naval battles between surface vessel and sub. Robert Mitchum and Curt Jergens are superb as the antagonists and a cast of good character actors keeps the story turning.

there is a part when the U'boat crew starts singing like a bunch of drunks in a pub and that was stupid in my opinion. but this was 40 some years ago and musicals were the way of entertainment.

The mind game being played out between the two captains, is the core of this film.  The tension is amped up, as the hunt progresses, on both sides.  The ending is somewhat implausible, the destroyer escorts were not heavily protected ships, they were not called ""tin cans"" for nothing.

345142,5,6301662954,"The movie script differs substantially from the original book. The ship is changed from British to American. More importantly, the final scenes of mutual respect and potential friendship between the protagonists is not at all how the book ends. In the book the destroyer captain hates the German captain so much he takes a swing at him while they're in the lifeboat. The movie also vaguely alludes to the ""enemy"" being evil (or the devil), not particularly the Nazis (""You cut off one head and it grows another...""). This gives the title ""The Enemy Below"" a double meaning not at all present in the novel.

There were liberals in Hollywood as far back as 1955.....

 The destroyer escort USS Haynes was portrayed by USS Whitehurst (DE-634), filmed in the Pacific Ocean near Oahu, Hawaii. Many of the Whitehurst's crewmen acted in the film: The phone talkers, the gun and depth charge crews, the sailor fishing, and all of the men seen abandoning ship, were Whitehurst sailors. The ship's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Walter Smith, played the engineering officer. He is the man seen reading comics (Little Orphan Annie) during the lull before the action.

Even knowing all of this, it is still a very good movie, a little bit ahead of it's time. If you noticed in the mid, late fifties a lot of the Hollywood war movies were toning down the hatred of Germans and Japanese. If you think i am making that up, watch some of the early black & White ww2 movies filmed during the war and up to around 1951-53.

345259,4,6301662954,"The Enemy Below is an enjoyable movie that does many things well but still falls short on several levels.  First, the good.  Mitchum and Jurgen are both good actors and their characters appear to be solid men who would be formidable adversaries in a war setting.  Unlike in some movies, the Nazi commander is not demonized.  In fact, he is portrayed as unsympathetic toward the Nazi cause and not particularly blood-thirsty.  He's just a man with a mission to accomplish and enough pride in his work that he doesn't want to fail.  Mitchum is similarly portrayed as a somewhat flawed commander, not the best of the best but still a competent and overall decent man.  In sum, the the adversaries are made to appear human.  Unfortunately, neither commander is an especially memorable character, either.  There's no Mr. Roberts in this movie.  Likewise, the action is somewhat muted.  Yes, there is a standoff between a submarine and a destroyer, and yes, the submarine tries to avoid destruction by diving to the limits of its capabilities.  There are some nice scenes with depth charges going off and views inside the submarine as the german sailors listen to all the explosions.  Mitchum's commander made some smart decisions.  The German commander was wily.  There was a climax.  Somehow, though, the action seemed a bit too easy on both sides, the climax a little bit underwhelming.  Perhaps I'm seeing this through the same eyes that watched the first Die-Hard and Midway and I'm expecting too much, but that's how I rate it.  Four stars because I enjoyed the movie but not five because it's not going on my favorites list and I won't be touting it as a gem that other people should watch when they get a chance.  It's good--but not especially memorable.",1372550400,,1756,4.812709030100335

Good yarn with a plausible script, ample technical texture and some pretty compelling performances particularly by Jurgens and Theodore Bikel (as the sub skipper's main staffer).  One attractive subtext: that parts of the German Navy had disdain for Hitler and the Nazis.",1372118400,,648,5.221153846153846

One aspect of the movie that comes through so well is the respect each commander has for the other, even as the duel it out on the high seas. The ending is a little corny where both the German and American crews work together to save their respective commanders, but the point was to show the respect that each adversary has for the other.

And the secondary story of the American crew's apprehension does their Captain know what he is doing fighting the German U-boat also figures well into the movie.  Overall it's a good movie and for those that enjoy old World War II or Navy movies, I would recommend it.",1372118400,,872,4.364197530864198
345264,5,6301662954,"A very personal tale of the tedium of patrol and escort duty on a U.S. destroyer in WWII, and you get to see the hardships of living in a U-Boat.  The Captain (Robert Mitchum) is laid up in the beginning from having his previous ship sunk out from under him.  You also learn a great deal about the salty, and experienced U-Boat Captain (Kurt Jurgens).  Kurt Jurgens, like Werner Klemperer (""Hogans Heroes"") was a survivor of the nazi holocaust and the war so his feelings were very real and personal in the movie. The movie was very well done up to the end when Hollywood had the destroyer actually ""run aground"" on a floating U-Boat (not physically possible) instead of cutting her in two after ramming.  It did, however, lend itself to the meeting of the captains, who helped each other and the U-Boat Ace's best friend and executive officer, escape.  Probably the best scene came from Kurt Jurgens as he talked about the war with his exec.  In the First World War he said war gave a country honor and strengthened it like steel.  This war, he said, was a bad war.  ""If we win, we win without honor, and if we lose, we lose without God.""  The acting was excellent, and the U-Boat and anti-submarine tactics were very good.

Consider the filming industries capability back then, the movie is realistic and exciting.  Still is today.  Comparing this movie to, ""The Hunt for Red October,"" wouldn't be fair due the emergence of digital technology.

I highly recommend this movie and place it in my long list of favorites.  Robert Mitchum plays the U.S. Destroyer's Captain and plays a confident commander.

345358,5,6301662954,"I grew up in the '60s with two much older brothers, both of whom were war movie fans.  As a result, I grew up with the same taste in war movies.  One of my particular favorites is The Enemy Below.  This is a very fine movie dealing with a subject that had been very frequently utilized in film making with regards to WWII; maritime conflict between surface vessels and submarines.  Most other films of this nature were very nearly mass produced, with predictably mediocre results.  The Enemy Below is quite different from it's contemporaries:  it paints a picture of the opposing commanders thinking, wondering just what was going through their counterpart's mind.  It's a story of strategy which does not begin to get  exciting until the climactic meeting of vessels at the surface, almost at the very end of the film.  This, it turns out is an altogether good thing.  The film holds your attention with thought provoking strategy, tactics and planning, rewarding the viewer's patients with a very fine ending.  The delicious whipped topping that made this movie very nearly perfect was the directing duties performed by Dick Powell, a very successful and well known character actor of the '40s, 50's and 60's as well as the casting of Robert Mitchum as the American destroyer commander, Curt Jurgens as the German submarine commander and Theodore Bikel as First Officer of the submarine.

The German commander's attitude toward the Nazi government was compelling. Especially when he covered up the Nazi quote above the hatch leading out of the command center.

345482,5,6301662954,"The Enemy... takes place during World War II but it is more than a war story. It tells of two naval captains, one American and one German, but war becomes second to a study in humanity. The U-boat captain is discovered, while on a mission, by an Americn destroyer captain. Both men are intelligent men and the story continues while each man tries to out think the other. Neither of them is happy about the violence of war but each has a job to do. We learn that the German is revolted by Hitler and the Nazis. When the cruiser finally outwits the sub and is doomed, the Captain orders the crew to abandon ship,while he remains with his dying first officer. The American also orders his crew off the mortally damaged cruiser and manages to transfer the dying man to his ship, and having a change of heart also rescues the captain. When they are both safely on a American rescue ship, it becomes very clear that they are two men who share the same set of values in spite of their allegiances to opposing countries. Honor and human values  in this movie win out over war and destruction. This may be Robert Mitchum's finest hour. Curt Jergens is wonderful in the role of his adversary.",1347235200,,1182,4.447004608294931
345483,4,6301662954,"This is a fine but ultimately fanciful tale involving a U.S. Navy destroyer and a German U-boat during World War II. Robert Mitchum plays the new and seemingly untested captain of the destroyer, on patrol in the South Atlantic, where it encounters the submarine and proceeds to engage it in a game of cat and mouse, as Mitchum matches wits and daring with the U-boat commander (Curt Jurgens), and the story alternates between the two crews, until they meet in the final battle. If you've seen ""Action in the North Atlantic,"" then you've seen several of the plot devices employed here by the opposing captains. But despite its derivative nature, the movie remains suspenseful and entertaining, with several unexpected twists. Shot aboard a real destroyer - though in the Pacific, not the Atlantic - the movie builds great suspense before it eventually disintegrates into a somewhat implausible climax. But it's entirely diverting until then.

345511,5,6301662954,"THE ENEMY BELOW is one of the best duel-of-wits on the high seas between submarine and destroyer ever filmed. Robert Mitchum as the captain of an American destroyer and Curt Jurgens as the captain of a German submarine try to out maneuver each other in a battle of nerves, instincts, intelligence, seamanship and raw courage. The multi-talented Dick Powell directed this taught drama, which remains one of the most memorable and benchmark films of this genre. The interior of the German submarine does not have the realistic or claustrophobic look as seen in DAS BOOT but that's not the point. Powell's focus is on the two captains and how they act and react. This film does not lose sight of the mentality of that era and the psychological makeup of the men at sea above and below. This is classic filmmaking and should not be overshadowed by the recent resurgence of certain World War II films that seem to have lost sight of the reason men fought and died. This film also has an impressive cast featuring David Hedison, Theodore Bikel, Kurt Kreuger and Doug McClure. Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens portrayed true men of honor each dedicated to their duty that they were called upon.

SINK THE BISMARK!is one of those rare films where we get to see the action out where it happens on the high seas and back at the underground war room in London during WWII. What a film. This is a great film because it mixes raw courage and tests our emotions to the ugly face of war while never letting us forget why we fight. One of my favorites.",1337040000,,1535,4.581818181818182

Probably because the men depicted in this picture are all but extinct: men of principle, bone and blood, and true gravel and grit. No need to write a rambling, detailed review here -- plenty of folks have supplied plot spoilers and critical reviews. I just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this picture and all of its details. The mental match between the two captains is a high-stakes chess game where any miscalculation could be fatal.  Mitchum is awesome as the American destroyer skipper.  Very much like my favorite Captain Kirk, he's daring without being brash -- aggressive without being foolish. He a completely confident commander with a mind for strategy and the intestinal fortitude to execute trenchant tactics. If you ever watch the original Star Trek episode ""The Balance of Terror"", you can see where its writers must have researched many such naval battles and film plots -- possibly even this movie since it was released in 1957 -- 10 years before Star Trek.

The poignant point is that even the most hardened warrior wishes for peace and the comfort of home.

There are some thrilling scenes interplayed by a destroyer cahsing a submarine and the submarine chasing the destroyer. The submarine firing torpedos and the destroyer sprawling depth charges. The irony of this film is when both captains have to abandon their destroyed vessels respectively and the enemy 'below' and 'above' are juxtaposed and seem to become reconcilable. In my own opinion I think that the message of the last scenes is a good message that both enemies suffer as humans and both parties desrve dignity.,1325721600,2,666,5.0636363636363635

1.  The Germans are not demonized.

3.  The two commanders respect each other.  Their enemy is more the war than each other!

I guess it has a hopefulness which is not in most war movies, showing how crises sometimes cause enemies to work together.  I like it most of all because it's unique, for not making either side the good guy or bad guy.",1309564800,,615,4.4774774774774775

Directed by Dick Powell

One of the best of this genre. More than a blood-and-guts war movie, though it has plenty of terrific action scenes.  It's more of a man-vs-man ""cat and mouse"" story. Absolutely excellent direction by Dick Powell and some outstanding cinematography. Crisp scenes between Jurgens and Theodore Bikel (who plays his Exec. Officer), that is nothing but facial gestures and eyebrows.

Powell shows you how to direct and shoot a well-scripted film, with some of the best performances from every cast member. An model of how to make a terrific story into a movie.

Mitchum and Jurgens, each a commander reveal they are firm in their beliefs toward their respective countries. While Jurgens is not the gung-ho Nazi, he does have a firm dedication to his fatherland, and what it was before the war. Mitchum also has the same firm devotion to his country, and what he is doing is the right course to bring a successful ending to the war, ultimately, but both commanders are desperately trying to out think and outmaneuver the other.

Special footnote: -- Look for good performances by supporting players Theodore Bikel as the Executive Officer of the submarine, David Hedison as the Executive Officer of the destroyer and Russell Collins as the ship's doctor on the destroyer. You might note a small role for Doug McClure at the beginning of his career.

345553,5,6301662954,This is one of my favorite old war films. The acting is superb. Robert Mitchem and Kurt Jurgens and the entire cast made an interesting and exciting movie.,1304121600,,155,4.571428571428571
345554,4,6301662954,First the title The Enemy Below after all is said and done is really not the enemy under water but the enemy within ourselves.  Yes the scene where the sailor gets his fingers cut off was not done well but the point of that is to parallel the problems on a sub where the guy goes crazy grabs a wrench and wants to get out. Each captain has his problems on his ship.  Each captain lost a loved one and each captain had a person they could talk to and that is where we see that both captains are in reality the same even though they are on different ships.  Mitchum's character distains war because as he said you cut off one serpent's head and another one grows. Saying you stop one war and another one takes it's place. Jurgens character found WW I glorious with a sense of purpose where WW II serves no purpose at all. The enemy below is the enemy within humanity itself but at the end there is hope for humanity found in the middle of the Atlantic. Problem with some people who rate these movies is that they are like deer and see the special effects like deers lookiing into lights not see the underlying message the story is trying to get across but I guess those type of people are not deep enough for the average intellect and give poor ratings.  I am kind of in between a 3 and 4 star. I would like to give it a 3 1/2 but not possible in this rating. The story itself was pretty good.  The acting I thought was good from the main characters.  For those who want action I would not recommend this.  But those who can view this movie in a different light in a way that gives food for thought I would recommend this movie.,1296172800,,1626,4.159235668789809

The problem is, ""Action"" was written 20 years earlier than ""Enemy Below.""  Shame on you, Dick Powell, for stealing all your major action scenes from an unsuccessful movie made earlier and thinking people wouldn't notice.  No, ""Action"" is not given any credits in ""Enemy.""  Actually, it might not be Dick Powell's fault:  It might be the fault of the Australian Navy commander who wrote the book ""The Enemy Below"" if he, the Aussy commander, wrote the final sequence exactly from ""Action,"" which, if not given credit, would be plagiarism.

Curt Jurgens is a survivor of the Battle of the Atlantic and is trying to stay alive to carry out a mission.  Both men meet in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in a deadly duel of wits.  For me it was not so much a matter of good versus evil but men versus the Atlantic as both the German and American ships are damaged and we see two battles, man against man and man against the sea.  Both battles are never ending.

Mitchum is saddled with a wardroom of reserve officers with little real knowledge of the sea and has to make do with them.  Jurgens has a ship of battle tested men whom he is leading. The contrasts are start at times as we see that one of the men working with to destroy the German submarine is a watchmaker in civilian life and now is working a depth charge rack aboard Mitchum's ship.  Jurgens has one officer steeped in the Nazi line and his treatment of him is quite interesting as we see how well he dismantles the officer's arrogance.

In the end, both captains have a wary respect for the professionalism of the other.  One might wonder about the respect for a man who's duty is to sink a ship on sight and without warning and maybe condeming the entire crew to death in one form or another.  Remember that in the Pacific, US submarines were doing the same thing to Japanese ships.

I'm compelled to compare ""The Enemy Below"" with ""Run Silent, Run Deep"".  The big difference is ""Enemy Below"" is filmed in beautiful color.  The other difference is the story line, character development and overall excitement and suspense created by the films.  ""The Enemy Below"" is more matter of fact.  It delivers it's story without building much interest in the characters.  It is very good at demonstrating tactics and maneuvers used by both U-boats and the American destroyers in WW2.  It you like films with a lot of technical navy data, real scenes aboard a destroyer and a great color print, then this film is for you.  I would give it 4 stars for that but it does not deliver the kind of tension and suspense generated by the earlier film.

Robert Mitchum and Kurt Jurgens deliver believable roles as the respective captains of the battling ships.  The reason I gave this 3 stars is my ratng looks at all war films or films about war and its effects on people and this film belongs in the 3-star group.  It's still a very good movie and one which many folks will enjoy more than once.

345587,4,6301662954,"The Enemy Below is a sturdy WWII movie that stars Robert Mitchum & Curt Jurgens. Capt. Murrell (Mitchum) is the commander of an escort destroyer in the North Atlantic. This is Murrell's first command since losing a ship several weeks earlier. Instead of recuperating extensively in a hospital he has chosen to accept the command of another ship. We don't see Murrell for about the first ten minutes of the film; we do get to hear several of the sailors discussing their new skipper. In these few minutes we learn that there's some doubt among the sailors about the ability of Murrell. This all changes when the radar picks up an unidentified blip. Murrell takes charge immediately quickly establishing himself as a no nonsense, able commander.

Von Stolberg (Jurgens) is the commander of the German U-boat. He's on a mission to pick up a British code book that has been captured & return it to Germany. He's an experienced commander who has his private doubts about the war.

The film is essentially a cat & mouse story, a chess game between the two commanders. They're both experienced & care about their crews. Throughout the film both are thinking through their strategies trying to outwit & out guess the enemy's next move. They end up with a grudging respect for the other which is displayed in the film's final scenes.

The film is presented in a wide screen format & was produced & directed by Dick Powell. There are some bonus features that include the film's trailer, other Fox film War Classics, subtitles & audio tracks in French & Spanish.

In this one, Robert Mitchum and Curd Jurgens wage a 96 minute psychological battle in the Pacific. The production begins rather slowly, with the American crew wondering whether their new captain is qualified for his new command, after serving in the Merchant Marines for years. Mitchum quickly allays all fears; he's as smooth and precise in command that one would think he was born at the helm. Below sea level, Jurgens is his German equal in many ways; not allowing his fiery disposition to cloud his judgment of his potential slayer above. The film builds in intensity as this naval chess game finallly reaches an apt but somewhat surprising conclusion. This story was copied almost directly by ""The Bedford Incident"" circa 1965, with even better results,in this reviewer's opinion.

345615,4,6301662954,"""The Enemy Below "" depicts a battle of wits ,strategy and cunning between two antogonists in the South Atlantic  during World War 2. One man is US Navy Captain ,Murrell (Robert Mitchum)and his opponent is Captain Von Stolbery (Curt Jurgens)a world weary U-Boat skipper .Both men have lost loved ones in the conflict -Murrell his wife and Stolberg his son ,also a serving member of a U-Boat crew. Von Stolberg is vehemently anti-Nazi and crosses swords constantly with the ""political officer""imposed on such vessels by diktat of the Nazi party. I suspect this was inserted as a sop to audiences of the time who might struggle so soon after the war to accept a German in a heroic light .

The clash arises when Murrell's vessel ,the USS Haines picks up a signal from the U-Boat .Stolberg is seeking to meet up with the main body of the German ""wolf pack""-he has a key British code book in his possession .
Despite his world weariness and heart sickness at the war and the fate of his nation under Hitler ,Von Stolberg will not tamely surrender. Maneuvers  and counter maneuvres .the two skippers -equally adroit and skilled -battle each other to a resolution .We witness the reactions of the two crews especially those of the U-Boat crew as the vessel is forced to wait it out on the bottom of the ocean and come under heavy assault from depth charges .

The acting is outstanding .Mitchum underplays beautifully bringing a stoical quality to the role that wholly suits the character and Jurgens ,in his first major English speaking role is brillaint as a man torn between love of his country and service but hatred of the nation's leaders .They meet only in the final moments of the picture.
Theodore Bikel impresses as Jurgen's second in command and look out for an early Doug McClure role.

Full marks to the expert direction of Dick Powell who builds suspense brilliantly but does neglect character at the expense of the mechanics of war .Technicolor photography of rare skill by Harold Rosen and a literate and intelligent Wendell Mayes script odd futher qualities to an exceptional ,even -handed war movie

345616,5,6301662954,This movie classic is one of the best action packed dramas of World War II dealing with an American Destroyer and a German U-boat. Robert Mitchum plays the American destroyer commander and Curt Jurgens plays the U-boat commander. Their sea craft cross paths in the South Atlantic Ocean and engage in a deadly cat and mouse game that can only end in the death of one of them. This duel of two very experience naval officers covers thousands of miles and is action packed. Over all the models are realistic enough that you can just sit back and be engrossed in the hunt. This movie not only shows us the mandatory hunting of the enemy in a deadly chess game where one mistake means defeat and death.

While it is a battle of wills between the able destroyer captain and the cunning submariner which is carried on anonymously, neither surrenders their humanity. Neither one wants to be fighting the war, but each is determined to do it the best of his ability, and just as easily set that dogged determination aside when they are thrust together at the end. It is a tribute to an excellent screenplay that this movie is not preachy or self-righteous, but shows how men adjust to a time of war and try to carry through everything that happens, but can survive it by holding on to their core values no matter what.",1193011200,,1307,5.136150234741784

Mitchum and Jurgens are both in fine form, and really demonstrate the futility of traditional patriotic warfare, if not its occasional necessity up through the 20th century.

There are certainly better films from the standpoint of showing the outfitting of a German WWII submarine, but that really does not detract from the drama of this film.  For the inscrutable U-Boat commander (also classically played by Juergen Prochnow in Das Boot), Curt Jurgens demonstrates exceedingly well the conflict of dual roles of commander and friend with his subordinate officer Heinrich.

The entertaining story presents a battle of wits between an American destroyer captain (Mitchum) and a German u-boat skipper (Jurgens) set in a bright, clean view of WWII.  Features probably the handsomest destroyer crew ever assembled and certainly the best-tanned u-boat captain.  Good things include some interesting characters, interesting dialog and nice shots aboard the US destroyer.  The u-boat is less well represented in terms of sets and equipment closeups.  Good depth charge scenes and a nice sonar sound.

Has a clear anti-war message and also a vaguely anti-Hitler German captain with whom it's easy to empathise.  Overall it contrasts strongly with Das Boot in terms of realism and grit although both films ultimately share a harsh view of u-boat life at war.

What ensues is a nerve wracking, tension filled game of cat and mouse between Jurgens and Mitchum in the Dick Powell produced and directed ""The Enemy Below"".  The movie's effectiveness in part is based on a minimum of propaganda and a focus on the strain and determination of the combatants.  Each captain and crew is pulling out all stops to complete their mission and thwart their opponent.

345691,5,6301662954,"Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens star in this exciting World War II drama about an American destroyer escort and a German U-Boat stalking each other in the waters of the South Atlantic.

Mitchum stars as Capt. Murrell, a former merchant marine sailor who had his merchant ship sunk by a U-Boat in the North Atlantic.  When asked why he wanted to get back in action so soon after the sinking, he replied that he wanted to be on the shooting end for a change.  Thought to be ""soft"" by his crew, Murrell soon earns their respect with his no-nonsense attitude and quick thinking.

Jurgens stars as Captain Von Stolberg.  A veteran of U-Boats from World War I and an enemy of Naziism, he still has a cunning edge to him, and he is every bit as methodical and quick thinking as his American counterpart.

While on station in the South Atlantic, Murrell's destroyer encounters Von Stolberg's submarine, and the chase is on.  Each captain masterfully commands their vessel and crew, while at the same time trying to figure out what the other's next move will be.  In the beginning, Murrell's destroyer has the upper hand, mirroring the sub's vain attempts at escape, while laying down a tremendous barrage of depth charges.  But they can't seem to deliver the coup de grace.

Meanwhile, Von Stolberg and his crew manage to weather the storm of depth charges while trying to manuver the American destroyer into a position where the sub can fire a spread of torpedoes.  This ongoing game of cat and mouse continues until Von Stolberg is finally able to shoot at the destroyer.  One well-placed torpedo hits the destroyer, but is this the end for the Americans?  What will happen to the U-Boat?

This is a treiffic movie.  Jurgens and Mitchum are tremendous in their roles as the opposing captains, and the action is non-stop.  The battle scenes and special effects are very good, and the movie won an Academy Award for its special effects.  I highly recommend this great war film.

I can see  how the decks gleamed in the sunlight, hear the sounds of a General Alarm and of men racing to battle stations, see depth charges, 20 MM and 3"" guns, ""hedgehogs"", sonar and radar sweeps, compasses, officers' quarters and enlisted men's cots stacked three high.

345695,5,6301662954,"Sailing on the high seas in his destroyer, the new captain encounters a submarine.  His wife having been killed in a ship sunk by a torpedo, Capt. Murrell (Robert Mitchum) has a special distaste for submarines.  He immediately gives chase and attempts to destroy the submarine.  Capt. Von Stolberg (Curt Jrgens) is a U-boat commander on a mission, and initially he sees the destroyer as more of a nuisance than a real threat.  We quickly learn the answer to the question asked by members of Murrell's crew, does the new captain know what he is doing?  We learn at the same time the crew does that Capt. Murrell knows submarine tactics.  It is soon after we learn that Capt. Murrell knows what he is doing that Von Stolberg also learns the same thing.  Now the chess game becomes serious.

We learn a lot about both Murrell and Von Stolberg as the movie progresses.  Von Stolberg cares little for Nazis and Hitler, an attitude typical among German submariners during World War II.  Von Stolberg is tired and anxious for the war to end.  While Murrell is just trying to do his job, you can sense equal measures of revenge and perhaps just a touch of regret that war and killing is necessary at all.  While he is very matter-of-fact as he chases the submarine, he does so without enjoyment.  At times I thought he was even a little sad that the conflict was necessary.  Von Stolberg too is distressed regarding the feinting of the two craft.  He wants to make his rendezvous, he wants to go home.

As the story develops we gain a deep respect for these two men as the scenes switch between the two characters.  We realize that while there must be a resolution, we too would rather the two ships go their own way, especially since we know the war must be near an end.

The special effects are somewhat spotty.  The interior views of the submarine and the destroyer are quite good.  The exterior views of the destroyer and submarine are generally good, but there are some exceptions.  Fortunately, the cinematography and skill of the director allows us to overlook the small flaws in the special effects, particularly as the movie draws to an exciting conclusion that makes us wonder whether either captain will survive the encounter.

It may be somewhat difficult for most to put themselves in the position of a World War II submariner without having seen one of these boats.  Fortunately there are several on display in various places around the country.  Once you realize how tiny and cramped submarines were in that era, you wonder at the fear of men under attack from above, particularly after the invention of sonar.  They can hear everything from the drop of depth charges to the horrendous explosion they make, yet, they can do nothing.  Learn how small these submarines are and you will appreciate this movie even more.

Also worthy to note in this movie is the presence of several well-known actors.  David Hedison, later to be on the bridge of the Seaview in the television series ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" plays Murrell's executive officer.  Theodore Bikel, character actor in numerous movies, plays Von Stolberg's second in command.  Well down in the credits is future ""Virginian"" star and movie star Doug McClure.  A number of other actors had extensive future careers at the time of their appearance in this movie.

This movie is one of the best of the movies about World War II.  The movie portrays the lengthy battle between a submarine and destroyer quite well.  More importantly, the movie focuses on the two captains and their mixed feelings about the combat.  This movie is worthy of having in any war movie collection or any collection that emphasizes conflict between two characters.",1098316800,37,3710,4.734789391575663
345696,4,6301662954,"With so many other (mostly positive) reviews for ""The Enemy Below"", I will try to keep my comments brief. This is a fine World War II thriller set in the south Atlantic, with a US Navy destroyer and a German U-boat hunting one another in a deadly game of nautical chess. It was released theatrically in 1957.

Robert Mitchum stars as the destroyer captain, with a major chip on his shoulder towards German submarines. A previous ship he was travelling on was torpedoed--he survived--his wife did not. As usual, we have one of Mr. Mitchum's excellent performances--tough as nails, but all too human at the same time. His adversary, the U-boat captain, is played by Curt Jurgens--this role is the more difficult of the two, and Mr. Jurgens is quite marvellous. This German is a decent human being, trying to do his ""job"", hating the war and especially the man who is destroying Germany and its people--Adolf Hitler. Mr. Jurgens simply wants to get home, with his crew and boat in one piece. This is no cartoon Nazi--just a human being caught up in war, like the rest of the men on his submarine.

Since both captains are extremely intelligent and experienced seamen, their ""duel"" becomes a fascinating exercise for the audience, with liberal amounts of suspense and action. Director Dick Powell does an excellent job--he would re-team with Robert Mitchum a year later for ""The Hunters"", a fine Korean War aviation film ( also reviewed by yours truly ).

The supporting cast is fine--Al (soon to be David) Hedison is Mr. Mitchum's patrician second-in-command--his opposite number on the U-boat is played by multi-talented Theodore Bikel. You will also spot a very young Doug McClure on board the destroyer.

Fox has given us a beautiful, wide-screen picture--the colours are fine. There are only a few extras--a trailer and a news clip. I must express my surprise though at the mistake on the cover of the DVD--other reviewers have noticed this too. The cover is supposed to depict the two main adversaries in the film--Mr. Mitchum is there--but the other profile is certainly not Curt Jurgens. Both of these fine actors have passed on. Surely, with one of Mr. Jurgens' best performances in ""The Enemy Below"", he deserves more respect than this ! ?

I only gave ""The Enemy Below"" four stars because, if I give it five, what would I give ""Das Boot"", the best submarine film ever made ? Still--if you like World War II action thrillers with two great stars at the top of their game, this DVD must be in your collection. Recommended.",1095033600,18,2527,4.786697247706422
345697,5,6301662954,"Dick Powell had to have had one of the most interesting careers in Hollywood history.  He started out as a golden-throated pretty boy actor, made a successful mid-career shift to hard boiled roles like Philip Marlowe and then, for good measure, directed a handful of movies, including the submarine action picture THE ENEMY BELOW.
  THE ENEMY BELOW is a 100% action movie, without any distracting romantic sub-plot or comic relief crew members.  Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens are excellent as the American destroyer commander and U-boat commander who cross paths in the Atlantic Ocean and engage in a deadly hunt.  With a few exceptions the models are realistically rendered and convincing.  This is one of the best war movies out there, and maybe the best navy movie available.  I strongly recommend it to action fans.",1090108800,45,821,5.037037037037037
345708,5,6301662954,"This is not the average sub-film that centers on the crews of the sub and the sub-chaser. This is a two-man cat and mouse film, marvelously done with style and incisive insight.
Robert Mitchum is the man who rises to do what is needed. Not a superhero, but a very human man who goes into war and does what is required. He is the Captain of a U.S. destroyer sent out to track U-boats. Curt Jurgens is his mirror reflection - below - a Captain of the U-Boat that becomes the target of Mitchum's search. He is not a product of the Nazi war-machine, but again, a very likable man just defending his country. This is demonstrated with deft humor when Jurgens very deliberately hangs his jacket over the plaque of Hitler's propaganda.
The script eschews the stereotypical ""Nazi monsters"", and portrays a German crew with very real - and universal - emotions. They, too, were just men doing their job and what is required. Instead of having us root for the Americans to blow up the evil Germans, you are put in the position of caring equally for both sides. You comprehend that they are men, offering their lives for their command, not in a political way, but in a time-honoured fashion of a man going to war. You understand both sides REALLY do not want to be here, to kill or be killed; they would rather home. No rousing stereotypical propaganda. In the end, they will kill each other if they must, but given the choice, they would rather not.  Very different for that period of war films.
A little dated appearance on the boat scenes by today's standards. It's obvious toy models when the boats crash, but easily overlooked and dismissed when balanced with the very impressive lack of finger-pointing and flag-waving for either nationality. Both Mitchum and Jurgens are dead-bang on target in their lead roles, with David Hedison, Theodore Bickel and Doug McClure round out a super cast",1090022400,167,1883,4.654654654654655
345709,4,6301662954,"""The Enemy Below"" benefits from an unconventional performance and writing that makes it stand out from the pack of World War II films produced int he same era. Robert Mitchum plays the commander of an American destroyer and Curt Jergens as the commander of a German U-boat. They're stalking each other at sea playing a high stakes game of chess with each man carefully considering each move and countermove. Mitchum's commander may be a bit layed back compared to some but it's what keeps his men devoted him to him. Jergens plays his captain as someone who is doing his duty but doesn't believe in the Nazi cause.
Director Dick Powell's first film(who also did the well regarded ""The Hunters"" also featuring Mitchum and Robert Wagner about Korean War pilots stranded in enemy territory)keeps things suspenseful and taunt by confining his action sequences to the ships. Since we don't really see the outside world beyond the commanders' worlds, we feel as if we're on the boats with them. The Oscar winning optical effects involving the miniatures for both ships (as well as live action footage shot on very, very convincing sets)still looks pretty convincing even in our digital age. Water is one of the most difficult things to shot in miniature because the water beading up on the surface or the wakes generated by the ships don't get any smaller, hence it tends to give away the illusion if you're not careful.
There's no notable extras beyond some previews but the glorious widescreen presentation and Deluxe color vividly reproduces the original theatrical experience. There's few of the analog blemishes one might expect. The use of a dual layered disc means the film looks natural with few of the pixel problems when a film is compressed incorrectly.",1089417600,4,1758,4.9425675675675675
345710,4,6301662954,"This is the movie that sets the standard for submarine movies.  Made in the late 1950s, ""The Enemy Below"" has aged very nicely, and is still just as enjoyable as it was when it first came out.
This is a tough, taut film of warfare at sea.  Robert Mitchum puts in a superb performance as the no-nonsense, competent American destroyer skipper.  Kurt Jurgens is excellent as the thoughtful and professional German U-Boat commander.  The story is simple.  In the South Atlantic, the American destroyer detects the German U-Boat, and has a mission to destroy it.  The U-Boat has a mission which requires it to slip away from its American pursuer.  The two highly experienced captains must seek to read the mind and guess the intentions and actions of the other in a complicated chess game.  All of this makes for an excellent story.
The German commander (Jurgens) is shown to be a non-Nazi and a humane thoughtful man.  He fights because he is a professional, despite his belief that he is fighting ""...a bad war.""  Since this film was made at the height of the cold war, one suspects that there is an element of reconciliation in the story--the notion that although Americans and Germans were enemies in WW2, they were going to be able to reconcile once the war was over.  The story has this thread throughout.  I don't wish to give away the story, and more would be telling.  Suffice to say that this is an absorbing flick that achieves its goal: it entertains.
This is one of the classic submarine flicks.  Enjoy.",1088467200,5,1511,4.652830188679245

However, it is interesting to note that 'The Enemy Below"" release date in the U.S. is 1 year behind Japan in February 2003, France in May 2003 and U.K. in June 2003.
Has Fox made a mistake on the DVD sleeve. The German U-boat kapitan played by Curt Jergens certainly does not wear a moustache, not to say a gray one. The identical picture of the UK, Japan and France DVD sleeve showing Robert Mitchum with his burning destroyer in the background gives a better depiction of this action-packed war movie.",1085875200,,645,4.521367521367521
345714,4,6301662954,"In recognition of Memorial Day, Fox Home Entertainment will release five classic war movies on DVD  in an eclectic mix that takes us from the trenches of World War I ravaged France to the skies above Korea in the Korean War.
Perhaps the most anticipated of these movies is the often postponed ""The Enemy Below"" which had previously been targeted to coincide with Memorial Day 2003. As tense as submarine movies come this well respected movie follows the game of cat and mouse between the relentless captain of an American destroyer and a U-boat captain in the waters below.
That is what sets this movie apart from all others in its genre. The cover of the DVD sports the images of its two lead actors, Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens, and in a sense that accurately conveys the human drama that is the underlying theme for the movie. In both the American and German sides, the crews are relatively insignificant. The main focus of the movie is Mitchum's characters determination to outsmart and sink his quarry and Jurgens'  characters equal determination to evade his adversary and complete his mission.
The quality on the DVD is surprisingly good considering the age of the original elements with no noticeable dirt or scratches on the transfer. Special features for the release  include three short vintage MovieTone clips from the 1940s that detail the battle for the Atlantic.",1083283200,8,1381,4.8931623931623935

345716,5,6301662954,"The enemy below is one of many movies that set out after the end of the second world war to reverse what America and their allies thought of Germans. After having to de-humanise them (as they did to us) for a decade or so to enable our young men to fight, kill and eventually defeat them, by 1957 we had new bad guys, (Boris and natasha cartoons) the Russian Communists to contend with. Also West Germany was now our staunch ally and so the need to reverse public opinion about the hated Hun.
This movie does a remarkable job in starting to reverse anti German feelings. It's a good yarn, tense and sells us that really the beasts were not beasts but just good men pitted against each other. Most of them anyway. It must have went a long way towards achieving it's goal of re-conciliation between two former enemies, now allies.
The singing of the rousing song ""The Dessauer Marsch"" written in 1706 with words no doubt written for the u-boat crews is a bold adventure as they refer to ""Nazi fellowship"".",1066003200,4,1003,4.4863387978142075
345717,5,6301662954,"First of all, this was not an American story, the original novel the movie was based on is written by a retired British Navy Commamder.  The destroyer was a British destroyer, and the destroyer captain is a British Officer. Dick Powell's movie  changed them all to American.  However, this change does not shadow his brilliant performance in his direction of the movie.  Two experienced sailer, crossed line of each other on the high sea, one desperately tries to evade the other, the other desperately tries to pursue his target, each uses his best effort to frustrate the other's attempt.  Aside from the seamanship, leadership, and technical knowledge of enemy vessel's performance ability, both charactors have also demonstrated chivary in a war of nasty.  The ending scene dramatically shows the war can be romantic, chivarious, regardless the regime he represents.  In wars like today when a nation vows to assassinate the oposing country's leader, this movie is refreshingly clean and non-violent, even peaceful.  If there is any shortcoming in this otherwise excellent film, I would say it is the unnecessary cheap addition of Anti-Nazi propaganda.  So if we have to praise a German soldier, we must also say he is anti-nazi, otherwise he is not worth our praise.  This is a common mentality of some of Hollywood's best directors.  A mild insult of the reader or watcher's intellience.",1053993600,5,1393,5.092511013215859
345738,5,6301662954,"There are very few war movies I have not seen. Of those close to hundred or so that I have seen this is in the top ten. The psychological battle that takes place in each captains mind and in fighting the enemy is very well done. Yes it is true that neither wants war but they must do their duty and in doing so they are clever adversaries. If you like war movies that give both sides perspective like ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""The Battle of the Bulge"", and ""Hell in the Pacific"" you should enjoy it. The key roles by Robert Mitchum and Curt Jergens are superb and the supporting cast is quite good as well. The battle sets are professional and look great even compared to todays standards. The music adds to the suspense throughout the movie. The director does a fine job of pulling us into the movie and keeps the pace brisk. One for anyone that enjoys good war movies to add to their collection. If you enjoy Naval movies this is one of the best. I can't wait till my pre-order of the DVD arrives 5/20/03. Did I say pre-order? Something has now happened so that you can not order this movie. After three months I am beginning to wonder what happened to foul up the release.

345739,5,6301662954,"This is a classic war movie.  What makes it unique is that it is a battle fought at sea between two excellent sea Captains.  Kurt Jurgens is the German U-Boat Commander and Robert Mitchum is the U.S. Destroyer Captain who's job it is to sink the U-Boat before the U-Boat sinks his ship.
This is a movie that is intelligent and realistic.  Both Captains are involved in a deadly game of wits and tactics. Both Captains know the sea very well and both develop great respect and fear for each other's capabilities to sink one another.  A fine supporting cast enhances this movie as well.  Jurgens is the U-Boat Commander who has no love of ""Der Fuhrer"" Adolf Hitler, but does have the utmost loyaltly towards his Fatherland, his U-Boat and his crew.  Mitchum portrays a newly assigned Captain of a Destroyer who trusts his crew and his own decisions.
Both Captains play the ultimate game of ""Cat and Mouse"" on each other.  Neither are winners, one definitely loses more, yet both have gained utmost respect and understanding of each other.

On the voyage, the destroyer encounters a German U-boat (captained by Curt Jurgens) which is en route to a rendezvous with other German vessels.  The bulk of this film is a classic ""Killer Sub vs. Sub Killer"" (as mentioned in the trailer before the film).
The strength of this movie is not the cat-and-mouse battle.  The power of this film lies in the portrayal of both sides of the battle.  War is hell, and everyone merely wants to go home.
This is ""Das Boot"" many years before it was made.  You will even see ""Hunt for Red October"" scenes here.  This film is well worth the viewing.  This is Mitchum and Jurgens playing roles made for them.  I highly recommend it.",1022025600,77,840,4.402597402597403
345742,4,6301662954,"There was a lot of flak about _U-571_ because that movie fictionalizes the seizure of an ENIGMA machine from a U-boat... combining two real events involving BRITISH sailors and ships (the capture of the U-505 being almost irrelevant to the ENIGMA story).
No (previous) reviewer had mentioned that _The Enemy Below_ is based on a novel of the same name ... involving a BRITISH destroyer hunting a U-boat.  The movie tracks very well with that novel, other than some cultural changes for the US crew of the US ship. Therefore I think that Leonard Maltin may have it wrong when he says this is essentially a remake of a 1930's movie.  I believe it really is an Americanization of the (early 1950s) British novel.
Yes, the  (original) _Star Trek_ episode ""Balance of Terror"" is based on this movie.  Both are gripping and suspenseful, and have memorable moments.",1012262400,2,858,4.816326530612245

Mitchum is not seem at first and remains a shadowy figure to the crew.  Like Huston's MOBY DICK this approach works, but Ahad's crew knew Ahad.  Mitchum's crew wonders if he knows what is doing since he is new to the ship.  Like Ahad both have suffered by the prey they seek.  Like MOBY DICK both hunter and the hunted will suffer from a series of escalating and violent confrontations.  When Mitchum does appear it is clear he does know his business as Jurgens soon discovers, but Jurgens has some surprises as well.

THE ENEMY BELOW is not up to the standards of RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP but is better than TORPEDO RUN. It is also different that both those movies. Where they use a dramatic human interest story as the main plot line, this movie has a narrow focus on what you would expect from a film about a sub battle. The emphasis is on the chase, the strategy, the cunning and wiles of both commanders - US destroyer Captain Murrell (Robert Mitchum) and veteran German U-Boat commander Von Stolberg (Curt Jurgens). The drama is in changing fortunes - now who is the hunter and the hunted? Both of the main characters are well developed, and while there are differences in behavior, motivation, and naturally, stategy, the movie also shows clearly that as professional sailors they recognize and appreciate the good qualities in their opposites. As such this movie is memorable for the fact that Germans are not demonized or simply stereotyped as Nazis.
It's a well directed movie, with excellent moments of suspense, good acting in some key supporting roles - Lt Ware (David Hedison). The only let down is with some very obvious models in some of the battle scenes.",994982400,12,1286,4.771300448430493

Robert Mitchum as the captain of an American destroyer and Curt Jurgens as the captain of a German submarine try to out maneuver each other in a battle of nerves, instincts, intelligence, seamanship and raw courage. The multi-talented Dick Powell directed this taught drama, which remains one of the most memorable and benchmark films of this genre. The interior of the German submarine does not have the realistic or claustrophobic look as seen in DAS BOOT but that's not the point. Powell's focus is on the two captains and how they act and react. This film does not lose sight of the mentality of that era and the psychological makeup of the men at sea above and below. This is classic filmmaking and should not be overshadowed by the recent resurgence of certain World War II films that seem to have lost sight of the reason men fought and died.
