241874,5,6300214192,"A really creepy and suspensefull horrormovie with a lot of great suprisescenes! Better then the first one! Jason is a mutch scarier killer then miss voorhes. And the story is more developed in a POSITIVE way that  ceaps the mysterius creapy feeling over the story. The little shed that  jason lives in with the secret room that chocked the policemen really  freaked me out. Good that they cept the scary classic ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha  sound! Jason looks muth scaryer in the ""mask"" or what ever you  wanna call it, that he has in this movie then the hockey-mask in the bad  sequels. A classic horrormovie thats defenetly worth a look! I hope they  will make a remake of this movie couse that would bee a masterpiece! Couse  thats the only negative with this film:the fakt that its so low-budget. See  it, and youll wish the same..!

241875,5,6300214192,"This is the first appearance of Jason Voorhees (except for the very ending  of part one, where he is a very young boy). Approximately a year later,  miraculously full-grown and very hideously deformed, Jason comes and  murders a whole load of teenagers. Great pointless fun, one of the best of  its kind.

241876,3,6300214192,"Okay, it's fairly bad, but a very decent movie for the genre at the time.  Amy Steel as the heroine, Ginny, gives a pretty good performance, and the cinematography is superb for a slasher movie.  Some criticize it as being a copy of the first movie, but it simply uses the first as a base for expansion and does pretty well for itself.  Definitely worth a look!

241967,5,6300214192,Friday the 13th part 2 is awesome on blu-ray the picture the sound are perfect this movie is great to add to my horror collection thank you!,1508371200,,140,4.222222222222222
241968,4,6300214192,"Five years after the Camp Crystal Lake Massacre, a group of counselors hold a training camp near the defunct, notorious crime site, where they mostly get into typical shenanigans like trespassing on Camp Crystal Lake, drinking, having sex, and doing drugs. This doesn't sit well with Jason, who sets out to kill all the camp counselors and punish them for their immoral behavior in honor of his mother.

Friday the 13th Part 2 is a vast improvement over the first which dragged and had no suspense up until the end with Mrs. Voorhees. The mythology for the whole series is kind of wonky. Jason appears as he is most known, a hulking silent beast of a man. Instead of his signature hockey mask, he wears a bag over his head with only one hole to see out of. He dispatches teens with knives, a garrote, and his signature machete. The kills are decent and the the lead-up can be suspenseful. It was made with the awareness that the audience knows when kills are coming and still surprises at times. Most of the teens are interchangeable, but I was disappointed when Mark died. He seemed decent and was largely dismissed by everyone else because of his disability when he had big dreams and aspirations.

Ginny, the final girl, is the best character in the whole movie. First, she's a student in college studying child psychology. Unlike most final girls, Ginny has a boyfriend and it's implied that they have sex. She also drinks at a bar. It's interesting that this portrayal is more progressive than Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 even though it was made 5 years later. Anyway, her psychology training gives her insight to Jason's mental state and it ends up saving her in the end. She puts on Mrs. Voorhees' sweater and pretends to be his mother, which buys her and her boyfriend much needed time.

Friday the 13th Part 2 is a decent sequel and much better than the first. Jason isn't my favorite slasher villain by far, but the movie was enjoyable. The ending has some inconsistencies that make me want to see the next movie if Ginny is in it. I doubt she is and I doubt they'll say what happened to Paul, but I can always hope. Maybe I'll work my way through the rest of this series even though I haven't heard good things about further installments.",1508025600,,2247,4.570719602977667
241969,4,6300214192,"Part 1 SIDEBAR:  You may recall that in part 1, almost in the form of a Psycho (1960) mother-son role-reversal, Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer; Friday the 13th) was our killer and she was taking her cues from the inner voice of her presumably deceased Jason in her head (Kill her, mommy).  Part 1 ended with her being decapitated (great scene) and her decaying son (perhaps a dream) pulling our final girl Alice (Adrienne King; Friday the 13th, The Butterfly Room) into Crystal Lake.  Of course, when she awoke in the hospital, the sheriff informed he she was found in the water and there was no sign of a boy.

Director Sean S. Cunningham (DeepStar Six) brought us a low-budget ($550K) franchise opener iconic among slasher, revenge and summer camp horror.  Boldly following in his footsteps, the very capable director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th Part III, Warlock, House, Halloween H20, Lake Placid) starts his career with twice the budget ($1.25 million) to introduce us to the franchises next killer: Jason.  What I find most amusing is that this movie is about Jason Voorhees avenging his mother who died avenging Jasons deatheven though he never actually died.

Halloween SIDEBAR: Its fair (if not obvious) to say that Halloween (1978) clearly influenced subsequent slasher movies.  Someone (to me, on Facebook) recently made the claim that Friday the 13th was a was a direct spin-off/rip-off/carbon copy answer to Halloween. With respect to part 1, I cant say I agree with the extremity of the comment (e.g., carbon copy) when the killer was a crazy mother with nothing supernatural about her.  Even in part 2, Jason is just a man who cowers at the sight of a girl with a chainsaw and collapses after a kick in the ballseven if he does re-emerge alive after a blow that would kill anyone.  Only in later installments did Jason become the unstoppable undead menace we know today (and, in that respect, more like Myers). However, we do find a victim pegged to the wall (in part 1, with arrows; as Myers did, with a knife) and, in part 2, Jason definitely mimics the Michael Myers head tilt (after sticking the guy to the wall in the kitchen).

Mrs. Voorhees may be dead, but her sons body was apparently never recovered and local folklore suggests Jason lives in the wilderness.  But no worries, crazy locals like Ralph (Walt Gorney; Friday the 13th Parts 1 & VII) continue to warn all would-be campers you're all doomed.

Moving at a more brisk pace than the much slower original (although not slow-paced back in 1980), a bigger camp staff means more victims, more kills and more nudity.  Now five years after the events of part 1, Ginny (Amy Steel; April Fools Day), Ted (Stuart Charno; Christine, Once Bitten) and Sandra (Marta Kober; Neon Maniacs, Slumber Party Massacre III) among many others are hired to prepare to open a camp on the other side of Crystal Lake.  These summer staffers die from all manner of stabbings, slashings and barbed wire strangling (likely inspiring the Wrong Turn razor-wire scene).  My favorite death scenes were the speared lovers and the toppling wheelchair.

Much as in part 1, the glimpses we get of our killers hand and clothing seem very human. Although his breathing is a bit on the eerily heavy side and, when we see him at the end, his face is a disfigured fright.

Its funny looking back at this movie after seeing a total of 12 franchise films which make the killer larger, more unstoppable and more supernatural with each sequel.  Watching this 1981 killer is almost humorouslike, remember when Jason (Warrington Gillette, 61; Time Walker) was just a dude who actually ran after his victims (unheard of in later sequels), was scared of chainsaws, and was slowed down by a kick in the balls from a scared girl?  Yeah, Jason has come a long way. LOL

Playing off the nightmarish end of part 1, we close with what may or may not have been our final girls bad dream and the questionable notion of whether or not Jason is still alive.  Probably alive, right?  In either case, part 1 was a classic that joined Halloween in ushering in the modern slasher era. But this sequel (the first Jason movie) is what really ignited the franchise by offering a movie with greater rewatchability and more excitement than its predecessor.",1508025600,,4267,4.752032520325203

242141,5,6300214192,"Friday the 13th Part 2 is slow, dated, and by slasher standards there isn't much show stopping gore.  Despite this, the movie remains a classic of the b-movie horror genre and many fans' favorite entry in the series.  This is probably due to the affable main counselor Ginny and many of her funny counselor friends.  It might also be due to the slasher formula just working.  The 1st half, while rather bloodless sets up our characters as enjoyable people you might enjoy being around.

It's less bloody but every bit as violent, with a comically ever-present Jason stalking through the shadows in almost every scene (no matter how distant), seeking hapless teenagers to string up for the vaguest of reasons. He's not quite the icon he'd grow into with later installments - no hockey mask, clunky coveralls, a tuft of long brown hair - but he does a fair job of mixing up the arsenal and he's usually bathed in shadows so we can give that a pass. There isn't much to root for in the bland cast of victims, which checks off stereotypes like a politically-correct Saturday morning cartoon. Even at an economical eighty-seven minutes, I felt like we were spending a bit too much time with these shallow, repetitive supporting characters. Special points for sending the wheelchair-bound counselor down a steep flight of stairs with a gaping head wound, though. Redundant and formulaic, rambling and aimless, it's a little too comfortable with aping the original where it could be seeking broader pastures.",1475712000,,1094,5.016483516483516

242446,5,6300214192,"Two months after the events of the first Friday the 13th, the sole survivor of the first film, Alice Cooper is recovering from her trauma. In her house, she's horrified to find the severed head of Pamela Voorhees and is murdered by Jason who sticks an ice pick in her temple. The film then fast forwards 5 years later where a young teen, Paul Holt, hosts a camp-counselor training camp at a building not far from Camp Crystal Lake that consists of prankster Ted, wheelchair-bound Mark, troublesome Scott, the innocent Vickie, couple Jeff and Sandra, and Paul's assistant.

One night at a campfire, Paul tells the would-be counselors the legend of Jason Voorhees as a warning to not cross the fence that separates them and Crystal Lake. None of the teens take the story seriously and brush it off as a joke. It's not until these ignorant, hard-headed teens start getting picked off by a now older Jason do they realize what they've stumbled into

Overall: Part 2 remains one of my favorites of the Friday the 13th series. Why? Why not? It marks the emasculating debut of Jason Voorhees who picks up where his mother left off and slays teens who tread in his yard---or in this case his lake. The mask hadn't debuted yet so Jason uses a pillow case with one eye hole to conceal his face while he slashes away. In a way, the sequel is strikingly similar to the first. Ultimately same game, different player. To keep it short, Friday the 13th Part 2 has everything that made an 80s horror movie great. Ignorant teens, a hardcore killer, topless girls, sex scenes, blood, and lots of killing. While the Friday the 13th took a dip nearing its end, this sequel signified great things that would become of the series throughout the 80s.",1447372800,,1727,4.62214983713355

So, after 5 years a new set of camp counselors come back..a new camp next to Camp Crystal Lake, where everyone got slashed 5 years ago. They are warned of course and don't listen. The characters are basically the same...horny couple, horny teenagers hitting on the opposite sex..you know, the normal story line. lol Jason makes his appearance in this one...without the mask, ugggg, you just have to have the mask. The ending kind of irks me because you don't see how the main girl survived..one minute shes getting attacked and the next she's being taken away in an abulance...hmm ok. Not my favorite one for sure, but still good.",1444089600,,785,4.737226277372263
242452,5,6300214192,"The ""dead"" boy Jason Voorhees is now very much alive and a man and we're expected to ignore the fact that the whole point of the first movie was REVENGE against camp counselors who allowed Jason to drown because his mother (a toothy Betsy Palmer) was too busy cooking to keep track of him.  Not only is Jason very much alive, but for someone who was supposed to be severely challenged, his disability didn't stop him from tracking down the one and only survivor of the first film and disposing of her with an ice pick!!!  At least he brought his mom along on this road trip.  Did they take the bus or drive?  Wouldn't someone wearing a flour sack on his head draw unnecessary attention?  Just saying.............

New director (Steve Miner), new writers, new direction.  And the myth of Jason as an indestructible killing machine begins.  Poor Jason has grown up with only a head for a mother.  He finds it terribly inconvenient, not to mention incredibly insensitive, that a training camp for bad counselors should start up on the very lake where he was brutally drowned!!!  And considering just how boring it can be living in the wilderness with only a head for companionship, should it be held against him that he hasn't learned to play well with others and sought to free up the neighborhood of pesky counselors!?

I like this sequel better than the original (confusing finale notwithstanding) because it introduces sack-head to the unsuspecting public.  Be afraid, very afraid, or as crazy Ralph put it before he was garroted by barbed wire.............""you're doomed!""",1443657600,2,1574,4.832089552238806
242503,5,6300214192,"Friday the 13th.
No one is ever going to confuse this movie with ""art"" because that's not the point, it's a slasher flick, it's suppose to be like this.  From its eerie opening with the sounds of frogs and scary Christian music on a full moon night, to that strange kikikiki-mamama noise that's hidden in the Psycho rip-off music by Harry Manfredini, Friday the 13th is an unabashed kill-fest.  Period.  It's one and only prevailing idea concerns punishing bad teenager because Jason Voorhees' mother (Betsy Palmer) was too busy cooking to notice her son was drowning.  Naturally, she blamed the camp counselors for her neglect.  Thus, when the camp was reopened 21 years later, she had to dispose of the new counselors as a public service.  Incompetence should not be rewarded.

Most of the ""scares"" are of the ""jump"" variety.  Most of the violence/killings are done out of the line of sight (you see the results but not always the actual killing).  The characters are a notch about animated mannequins.  The cinematography overuses the POV prowling camera gimmick (sometimes with laughable results as a person standing behind a small tree would be seen by passersby).  They show why too much of Betsy Palmer's dental work.  And logistically speaking, the killer couldn't have tossed a body through a window then two seconds later driven down a road far from said window.  (That has always bugged me.)

But for all its glaring flaws, the bad acting, the crappy dialog, it's still an enduring classic of the genre and one of my all time favorite slasher flicks.",1443657600,,1561,4.863636363636363
242504,5,6300214192,"Some facts about the movie:  Steve Miner was the director and producer, the make up and gore effects were handled by Carl Fullerton, and the musical score was still composed by Harry Manfredini.  It was made at a higher budget of $1,250,000,  it was released on April 30, 1981, it was a huge hit in its opening weekend grossing $6,429,784, and its Domestic Total Gross was $21,722,776.

The general plot: It opens with the sole survivor from part 1 Alice Hardy, having recurring nightmares/flashbacks of her horrendous struggle with Mrs. Voorhees all the way leading to managing to best her and get pulled down in the water by little Jason and then find herself in the hospital with no certainty as to what really happened.  Her mother calls her in concern over her and Alice lets her mother know that she needs to sort this whole thing out alone.  Alice goes to the kitchen, has some water set to boil in a teakettle, her cat comes in from the open window, she opens the fridge and finds Mrs. Voorhess's rotting head in the fridge.  Shortly after, an unseen killer picks up her ice pick and kills Alice with it.  This time in the opening credits the Friday the 13th title still rushes forward, but this time it explodes and the next thing you see is Part 2.  We still get to hear a creepy and eerie theme by Harry Manfredini which this time in the opening and throughout the movie his score has a sci-fi type element to it.  Next we meet Jeff and his smoking hot girlfriend Sandra Dier.  The 2 of them enter a small town in the big truck.  They go to a payphone to get some directions from some friend of theirs named Ted.  They soon get together with Ted to go work at a camp that's close to where the (now closed) campgrounds to Camp Crystal Lake is.  This camp is run by a guy named Paul Holt  When the camp counselors arrive to the camp we meet Paul.  Paul is filling them in on some important tips in regards to working there and also, we get introduced to sexy female counselors Terry and Vickie, also handsome perv Scott, and wheelchair bound Mark.  There were a bunch of other counselors but their names are never said and they're hardly in the movie.  Another hottie Ginny Field arrives late to Paul's chagrin.  Paul and Ginny are an item and Paul was worried about her when he didn't know if she would arrive or not.  While at the campfire roasting marshmallows, Paul tells everyone there all about Jason.  The sheriff intends to make sure that none of Paul's camp counselor's ever set foot on the Camp Crystal Lake's grounds as everything's been quiet for five years and that's the way he wishes it to stay.  As counselor's and the sheriff turn up dead, another big thunderstorm comes into affect, Crazy Ralph continues to try and warn people, and the killer having no problem with killing people in the next camp over, the angst incredibly deadly slayings continue this time by a different killer.

The night shots are just as well lit as before, the cinematography is still beautiful and beautifully shot, the new camp location feels just as isolating and confining, the cabins feel just as claustrophobic, the first person camera perspectives (like that of Dario Argento) are still awesome, and the music is still incredibly tense and eerie.

The gore and make up effects while not as well done as Savini's are still quite well done and the kill scenes really up the ante.

Unfortunately there was only one scene of nudity, but it's an enjoyable scene of nudity all the same.

SPOILER ALERT:  If you haven't seen this movie then you probably won't want to read this part.
Some of the choice kill scenes are, Scott getting his throat slit while hanging upside down from a noose, Mark getting a machete to the face causing him to roll backwards down the steps, and Jeff and Andrea's post-coital double homicide with the killer lunging a spear through the both of them.

This time the killer is of course Jason wearing a sack over his head with one eye hole for some reason (reminiscent of The Town That Dreaded Sundown) ,a plaid shirt, and overalls.  He fully utilizes as his weapons of choice, an ice pick, a pitchfork, a tribal spear, and a pick axe.  He's not wearing the hockey mask yet.  Jason has never been the same after both drowning and seeing Alice kill his mother.

One thing that occurs that tightens a certain loose end is when Jason catches Crazy Ralph at night and strangles him to death against a tree.  No more warnings were to come from him anymore, they're on their own from there on.

Once seeing his alter table with candles and Jason's mother's rotting head, Ginny's idea to wear her sweater worked considerably too well.  That's one of my top favorite scenes with the cool special effect of making Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) appear to be there when it was just Ginny fooling Jason.  I love the way they handled that magical moment when Ginny dashes at Jason with a machete in slo-mo while he's trying to finish off Paul.  They used the same instrumental song in the background and definitely made it come off similar to a certain scene towards the end of the first one.  END OF SPOILERS!

Overall, this sequel does its level best to not only properly pick up right were p art 1 left off, but it upped the ante in terms of gore and its body count.  Unfortunately there wasn't much nudity, but what you do get in that category is worth seeing.  The intro of a new killer was a bold move that truly worked.  There's more beautiful and very sexy people,  It proved unpredictable and scarier than the first movie, it took plenty of cues from the first movie with its first person camera perspectives, the ground shots of the killers approaching feet, the excellent cinematography overall, Harry Manfredini's freaky score with some sci-fi like elements to it, the stakes were raised higher for the gore and kill scenes, and its ending is a definite cliff hanger that'll send shivers up your spine for sure.

242508,4,6300214192,"A group of unlucky camp counselor are systematically stalked and killed by the murderous Jason (devoid of a hockey mask) in this sequel to the 1980 horror hit.

Out of the countless sequels in the series, this one, in my opinion, is the best or at least, one of the better ones. It is far more polished in its execution; relying on a lot of atmosphere, bone-chilling suspense, creative camera angles etc not just outlandish violence and while its young cast delivers in their performances with only a couple of the actors looking a bit stiff, the film's mood is really effective. The film follows the standard formula- lot's of violence, clichd dialogue and characters, forced humour, gratuitous nudity etc, but this one does it better than most. The Jason presented to us here, in his early stages of his ""bloody"" career, is far more terrifying. In the countless sequels that followed, he became more of a caricature; here, he is far more mysterious. The film does a good job in keeping his presence (and size) a mystery. Even in the scenes where we see a great deal of him, we see mostly his feet, his arms, his hands, with very few scenes shown where we actually get a good look at him completely and from the neck up. Interestingly enough, the disguise/mask used to cover up his deformity is a burlap sack with some holes cut out for his eyes - think ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"", and although it may not be as iconic as the infamous hockey mask, it is a chilling sight. The film also builds to a fine cat-and-mouse chase and although some scenes in the final stretch are a bit too dark and may lack the excess gore of more modern slashers, that anxiety is there in abundance.

""Part 2"" also has a whole assortment of attractive, amusing characters for Jason to chose from. Ranging from the strong-willed Ginny (Amy Steel- anyone remember her from ""The Powers of Matthew Star""? Maybe not), her blond boyfriend and head counselor Paul (John Furey), the incredibly fit Terry (Kirsten Baker) who happens to be one of the most beautiful women to ever grace Crystal Lake (and did I mention she's incredibly fit?), her adorable little doggie, Muffin, the handsome but snooping Scott (Russell Todd) and a wheelchair bound jock, Mark (the late Tom McBride) and his admirer, Vickie (Lauren-Marie Taylor). They are all here in all of their nave, sin-ful, ignorant glory. Most of the actors deliver really good performances with the stand-out being Steel. The gorgeous Baker and her side-kick (Todd) are the only ones that comes off a bit stiff but I think it is mostly their characters. They offer a lot to behold visually, but not much in substance and dialogue.

The film is violent, but aside from a couple of scenes, there isn't that much ""in-your-face"" gore (pun intended since there is one scene where ""in-your-face"" is quite fitting in its description). The kill sequences, and gore effects are very well done; surprisingly not done by Tom Savini this time around. There are also some really iconic moments in this film that just look great from a horror movie standpoint. Not to get into any spoilers but that quick shot of a wheelchair rushing down a long staircase in the woods in the pouring rain is fantastic - I always wondered how they managed the shot without the wheelchair falling over. Also, the POV shot of Jason's hand, with his stained finger nail, holding a knife as it slowly approaches his victim is incredibly effective and is just evidence how you do not need a lot of blood to make a scene disturbing. I do remember reading the lack of explicit gore in this film is due largely to cuts made to avoid the dreaded ""X"" rating. Unfortunately these cut scenes do not exist anymore (I do hope this is not true and that they will be found somewhere, sometime) and this is a shame; a Director's cut, or Expanded cut of this film would be an interesting view. This brings me to the ""Extra's"" featured in the ""Deluxe Edition"" DVD- the featurettes are good but not great and some are just too darn brief. I would have loved to have seen some cast interviews since most of them have literally dropped off the face of the earth and unfortunately there are no deleted scenes and this is what makes this ""Deluxe"" edition incredibly disappointing.

Overall, ""Part 2"" is a pretty good sequel (IMO the best sequel) and quite frankly, it is the only one of the follow-ups that rivals the original in quality, execution and performances - although Betsy Palmer's iconic performance as Mrs. Voorhees is kind of hard to beat. It is also one of the few ""Friday"" entries where the homicidal Jason is truly terrifying- the other being ""The Final Chapter"". As the sequels rolled along, he became too much of a caricature and the essence that made him terrifying originally is lost. Do not look for logic here, since the story, as a whole, doesn't make much sense, but suspend your disbelief and take pleasure at the sight of a much younger Jason doing some really bad things and despite the lack of interesting bonus materials, this release is a good purchase for horror fans. ""Friday the 13th - Part 2"" remains effective, even after repeated viewings. Get it (if you haven't already).

242590,5,6300214192,"Well, here we go with Jason now as a young adolescent seeking revenge for his mother's ""death"" and beheading by the first movie's only survivor (Adrienne King). You have to understand that at the time this movie was made in 1981, you only had a handful of ""present day"" horror movies. What I mean is, before 1978's ""Halloween"" (except Carrie 1976), you had to probably go back to ""Psycho"" (1960) which John Carpenter says is the granddaddy of all horror movies. After the success of ""Friday the 13th"" part 1 in 1980, an inevitable sequel was bound to be made after the ending. ""Halloween"" set in motion the ""holiday"" horror movies of the '80s and beyond. What fascinates me is the fact no one has made a horror movie about Thanksgiving, yet. lol  Back to Jason in part 2. After seeking the counselor that killed his mother off, somehow he is able to track her whereabouts and find the house that she actually resides in. You know what happens next. He then goes back to camp crystal lake and sets his sights on a new group that is at a camp across the lake.

The new counselors are eager to learn about Jason and what happened 5 years ago at the now forbidden camp. What they all didn't learn is that the lake is forbidden to all by Jason himself. I think this is one of the best horror sequels for slasher flicks of the decade. I found it suspenseful more than anything. I found the characters likeable, especially that of Teri, the tall sexy nude swimmer. It definitely has the ""sex"" thing going on, but what's a summer camp movie without that? lol Lauren Marie Taylor also shines as a young, sexy brunette.

I am a fan of the Friday the 13th movies and pretty much grew up on them coming out nearly every year or so in the '80s. The original 8 anyway. If you like the first one then you will like this as well. I like the characters of this one even more than that of the first, with the exception of Adrienne King's character. Paramount has done a great job on this Blu-ray edition.

242680,5,6300214192,"The characters were likable, the plot was interesting (well, as interesting as the previous one), and Jason's mask was hardcore.

Better than the first, better than all the ones after it, Friday the 13th - Part II was more on-point than any of the other movies in this franchise. The protagonist killed it, using her Chekhov's Skill to delay Jason and make for a killer (ha!) scene. Also, 1/3 of the movie wasn't filled with only 3D effects that you can't see in 3D because you're not in the theaters.

I'll start by going over the cast of characters (SPOILERS will be in this paragraph). In this one, the antagonist has had an upgrade to Jason, but Jason does not have on his famous hockey mask - instead, he sports a sort-of fabric bag over his head, tied loosely at the neck with a rope. This is almost scarier than the hockey mask because it, at first, almost makes his actions (tilting his head; toppling over easily; etc.) seem doglike. His weapon of choice in this movie seems to be an ice pick, though he'll drift into other means if he feels like it. The protagonists in this movie are much more likable than in the previous movie. We start with Sandra and Jeff, a couple; we don't learn much about these two past that, though it's obvious that Sandra's got a hankering for adventure, and Jeff does not. There's also Vickie and Mark. Mark is where the franchise first shows some diversity, putting a character in a wheelchair. These two quickly pair up and Vickie has this amusing scene right before she's killed where she thinks she's getting ready to go down on him (really she's getting ready to be killed) and she truly puts perfume all over her body - they won't need a bed of roses when she's buried, she'll smell like one. Mark is optimistic about his condition, believing he'll get out of the wheelchair before he dies, though the doctors don't agree. He seems very kind, as does Vickie. Terry and Scott are (sort of) a pair, as well. Scott, or, as I like to call him, Pretty Boy Floyd, lusts after Terry to the point of taking her clothes when she goes for a gratuitous midnight skinny dip. Terry resists his moves, but he keeps working it. Terry seems rather quiet, and Pretty Boy is quite the opposite. There's also Muffin. The condition of Muffin is not known. Oh, and Ted! He's the token goofball. His condition remains unknown, as well, though it's assumed he's fine, seeing as he was in town on the night of the massacre. Lucky duck!

(SPOILERS) Finally, our two main protagonists are Paul Holt and Ginny Field. They, too, are obviously coupled up, but they're not just in the movie to have some meat for Jason, unlike the others (most of the others get killed when they're doing something sexual, i.e. having sex). When Paul and Ginny return from the town to check on things, while Ginny finds a pool of blood in a bed, Paul laments about how ""the kids smoke better dope"" than he does. After they both see the blood, they descend the stairs to meet their doglike serial killer.

Ginny totally slays him.

By using a chainsaw, a kick to the groin, child psychology, and a machete (I think? I can't remember completely what the last weapon was), Ginny kills (ha!) it. Paul distracts Jason when Ginny goes in for the kill, then Paul helps Ginny back. However, after the obligatory nightmare sequence, it's unknown whether Paul really did survive the entire ordeal or not. It's possible that the eyeball that Abel finds in the next movie ""with the rest of the corpse"" is that of Paul's and has been hinted towards. Feel free to contemplate!

All in all, it was a great ride, especially in comparison to the other movies. They sort of lost touch when they got 3D effects - a horror movie doesn't need 30 seconds of yo-yoing and 30 more of juggling.",1410825600,3,3768,4.525697503671072

242684,5,6300214192,"I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Why? It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young people in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer -- who becomes more and more of a hideous monster over the course of the series -- implements an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end.

Released in 1981, one year after the first film, ""Part II"" is basically a retread of the first but with different characters, a different killer and a different camp on the same lake, not far from ""Camp Blood,"" i.e. Camp Crystal lake. In reality, the film was shot on an entirely different location--Kent, Connecticut.

It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is the general vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. The locations of the films in the series include Blairstown, New Jersey (I), Connecticut (II & IX), California (III, IV, V), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).

It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unstoppable monster that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the series introduced a campy element in Part III, which pretty much plagued the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway; still, I prefer the serious tone to the cartoonish. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about the first film--as far as realism goes--is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerfully psycho Voorhees gene.

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but--with the exception of the 2009 reboot--I don't find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not scary. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes. There are numerous jump-scares, of course, but that's not what I'm talking about.

""Part II"" doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 87 minutes. It introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, but he's noticeably smaller in stature and more human than in later sequels. A couple of times the main protagonist, Ginny (Amy Steel), is able to deter him fairly easily (like opening a car door or kicking him in the groin). Speaking of Ginny, she's a fine heroine in the manner of Alice in the first film and Pam in ""Part V."" Kirsten Baker plays the requisite hottie, Terry, and the filmmakers take advantage of her beauty. Unfortunately, the ambiguity of the ending is inexplicable.

GRADE: A-

(If you're wondering why I rate a film of this nature so highly, I'm rating it according to what it is -- a slasher film. No genre is beyond redemption or above contempt)",1406592000,3,3674,4.802215189873418

242686,5,6300214192,"Released in May, 1980, ""Friday the 13th"" was produced in the wake of the success of 1978's ""Halloween"" and also shares elements of 1976' ""Carrie."" The story revolves around a cursed summer vacation spot, Camp Crystal Lake, and the slayings of young camp counselors. Critics slammed the film and I'm not sure why since it's in the same league as the acclaimed ""Carrie"" and ""Halloween.""  Regardless, it was hugely popular at the box office, making far more than any of the sequels until ""Freddy vs. Jason"" in 2003. As of this writing there are 12 movies in the franchise and another in the works, easily making it the most successful slasher series and one of the most successful franchises of any genre.

I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Why?

Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end.

Speaking of the women, the first movie is highlighted by Annie (Robbi Morgan), Alice (Adrienne King) and Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) with honorable mention to Brenda and Claudette, the latter from the opening 1958 segment. As far as dudes go, a youthful Kevin Bacon is on hand as one of the counselors. Part II features the incredible Terry (Kirsten Baker), as well as Ginny (Amy Steel), amongst others. Speaking of Part II, it's basically a retread of the first film but with different characters, a different killer and a different camp on the same lake, not far from ""Camp Blood"" (although, in reality, the film was shot on an entirely different location -- Kent, Connecticut).

On that note, the first movie was shot in Blairstown, NJ.

I give ""Friday the 13th"" a fairly high rating because it IS an effective film in the often-maligned slasher/horror genre, not to mention it kicked-off this amazingly successful franchise. No genre is beyond redemption if done right and that's the case here. Part II is almost on par with the quality of the first (the ambiguous ending is lame).

The original runs 95 minutes and Part II 87 minutes.

242713,5,6300214192,"This is one of my top five favorite horror movies of all time. It has so many good things about it. It has a really strong cast and it nearly surpassing the first film. Both films had strong casts so it's a toss up. The lead character Amy Steel shines as the likable, resourceful,kind, strong and intelligent heroine. Steel is on par with Jamie Lee Curtis in terms of Final Girls. The story is about the camp reopening years after the killings and Jason who was believed to be dead is alive and ready to kill anyone who steps foot in his territory. The young cast turns in a strong performance Laurie Marie Taylor plays one of the young counselors who has a very memorable scene with Jason. She is a very nice and likable character who we care about it. It's important to care about the characters and most if not all the characters in this movie are very likable. The movie is very scary much like the first and very suspenseful. This had one of the greatest endings to a horror movie. The fight between Steel and Jason is awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seat as it's very long. I can watch this movie over and over with not getting bored with it much like the first film. I think it's a must own film for any true horror movie fan. I think this is a great starting point for new horror movie fans and new Jason fans. It's kind of an overlooked film of the series. It was very good. Enjoy the movie and cheers!",1393804800,,1421,4.227941176470588

242715,5,6300214192,I think next to Halloween 2 this is the best horror sequel it has the same ingredients that made the original. Like the original the movie starts out with the killer as a mystery you don't know who it is but this is the first sequel to feature Jason as the killer. But what I like about this one is jason wasn't famous yet he has a sack over his head instead of a hockey mask he stalks new people that come to reopen the camp nit knowing they are being stalked the kills are as creative as the first this has always been a favorite sequel of mine the only flaws I can see is the movie is too short but still it makes up for that and many of the kills sadly have been cut you barely see much blood in some of the kills but still the movie is good now I will also review this about the new deluxe edition of the movie the first eight Friday the 13th movies have been reissued with special features now the flaw of the deluxe edition of part two is there isn't much special features no deleted scenes no commentary like some of the other Friday deluxe editions sadly part two doesn't have much just afew scenes from conventions for the Friday the 13th movies interviews with some of the actors that played Jason. And a interview with the guy who wrote the book called crystal lake memories its very interesting and gives you info on the movie. Part two kinda is left as a mystery I have heard about many of the uncut scenes but nothing has been released. But I enjoy this movie so the lack of special features doesn't ruin the movie for me I would like a commentary or to see some deleted scenes but the movie is a good sequel if you haven't seen it I would recommend it Jason is alittle different in here but he is more human but I like the way he lurks and stalks in this movie I think this is better then the original it's a enjoyable movie.,1383696000,2,1841,4.116666666666666

242761,5,6300214192,"The Friday the 13th franchise remains one of the defining film series of the slasher flic genre. As a child I found the concept fascinating, but I wasn't allowed to watch the films. An indestructible, yet not undefeatable killer, Jason Vorhees was the archetype for film killers. An undead murderer with a simple story, an iconic mask which he nearly always removed at some point, and ridiculously risk-taking young victims just looking for a good time, this was almost a sub-category of its own.

As a film series, the story of Jason progressed, and had it's share of ridiculous moments. The low budget FX often take away from the shock value for modern audiences, and the first entry is mired down in hokey dialogue and poor acting, at least in the beginning. However, the best chapters in Jason's story are the first few. The original film finds it's own stride, and has an ending on a par with Psycho. The second chapter, which really gives Jason his due, sets up an even more sinister side of the character. Despite the fact that the iconic hockey mask doesn't get introduced until Friday the 13th part 3, these are the crucial introduction to a character who still sells Halloween masks.  As a fan, I love this series, both as a horror enthusiast and as a nostalgia trip. I think the earliest chapters are the best, since the last few installments just go way over the top-ending with Jason in space AFTER supposedly being sent to hell.

Still, if you love horror, know the franchise, or just want to see what does and doesn't work in a serial killer movie, it's worth your time, especially for the first few films. They are a walk down memory lane, and a guilty pleasure.",1377734400,3,1678,4.624161073825503

Harry Manfredini is back with a brand new, suspenseful, nail biter music score. This sequel is directed by Steve Miner and he's humble enough to give director Sean S.

Friday the 13th Part II is a lot faster paced than the first film. The climax gives you little time to catch your breath.

The murders were weakly executed with very little sound effects. The killer became too anonymous. There was too much undressing of girls. And the hair-dos were so funny, I kept laughing and wishing for hairdressers to jump out of the woods, ready to cut off about 2 tons of hair :)

242815,5,6300214192,"In 1980 Sean Cunningham released, not the first film of its kind, but the most famous (or infamous, depending; maybe I should say notorious?) of modern slasher films. Who would have known so many sequels and imitations would, or could, follow?

~ Camp Crystal Lake, 1958: Some teens are kicking back in a summer resort, when an unseen assailant enters one of the cabins and slaughters the two young people inside, who are about to engage in a little carnal, sinful fun. There was no apparent motive, no clues, no suspects.

Cut to the  present day: Friday, June 13th, 1980 (circa the film's release): After years of misfortune and general bad karma, Camp Crystal Lake is about to reopen. We, the viewing audience, know what's going to happen, even without having seen the film beforehand. A girl, maybe 18 years old, hitches a ride from the local diner to the cursed resort, as she is supposed to work there, but on the way she meets an untimely, grisley fate. In a very well-executed (I realize the pun after writing it) scene, the magic of Tom Savini's work comes to the fore, as Annie, the aforementioned hitchiker, is hunted down and murdered as well. And as beautiful as it is, nature doesn't care a whit about you; the trees standing tall and the birds going about their business as usual while Annie receives a fatal slice across the throat, spilling arterial blood on herself and the ground while this maniac looks on, bitter and spiteful.

Some fans of the slasher genre don't give this, the first installment of the series, the credit it deserves, because (spoiler alert for the two or three people who haven't seen this movie) none of the murders are committed by legendary fiend Jason Voorhees. But this installment is the most believable in the whole franchise. A deformed, possibly retarded boy is believed to have drowned in the lake while the camp's counselors and staff are unaware, too preoccupied with their own fun to notice. He was all his mother had, the light of her life, and now, due to negligence, he disappeared in the lake, and hasn't been seen since. Everybody says he is dead.

The main body of the film depicts the events of the rest of the night, as one by one, the people at the lake are mercilessly killed by this unseen stalker, and the morning after (spoiler again), as surviving victim Alice awakes from a vivid nightmare in the hospital (this scene is one of the best shockers in film history). The dialoge leads one to believe that  Jason Voorhees is dead, although it's possible he isn't. This doesn't contradict Pamela Voorhees' assertion that her son was left to die, because what if he didn't? He was still left alone to struggle in the lake, unable to swim. It was traumatic, and preventable; a mother's worst nightmare.

The movie itself looks good, nice and clear, good picture, wide screen letter-boxing, and though not hi-def, it is visually a good product nonetheless. The sound is nice and immediate, not bad at all; unless you want 5:1 surround, you won't be disappointed. But for cheapskates like me, it is optimal. There is an alternate audio track in French, which is  puzzling because the subtitles are in English and Spanish. So you can read the subtitles in English or Spanish, or listen to it in English or French.

~ ""Part Two"":

Picking up exactly where the first film left off, Part Two tells the rest of the early part of this saga; the continuity between the first two films is probably the best in the entire series. The first reel recaps highlights of the first film's last reel, Alice's deadly showdown with Pamela Voorhees. Per this part of the story, Jason has been living in a deplorable little shack in the woods since his near-death experience, believed by most to be dead, possibly even by his own mother. He was alone in the world, especially after seeing his mother's decapitated body on the lakeshore that night, and this is what set off his legendary killing spree: Anyone who came to his neck of the woods must die. Every killing was in revenge for his mother's death; a strange twisting of circumstances, given his mother's crime spree was to avenge her son's alleged death. Close family, huh?

There is some dialogue in this installment which helps clarify the story for the casual viewer who may have missed a few key points as to why Voorhees is out killing everyone who comes near him, as there is an element in this film's audience which don't care much about the specifics and may have missed them first time around.

The only thing in this sequel which reeks of the inferior sequel syndrome (just my opinion) is the way the ending virtually cloned the first film's ending. We get to see Jason in all his hideous splendor, but possible this was Ginny's nightmare, as she and Paul are being taken away in stretchers as the major scare scene cuts to the next morning. It is effective, made me jump many times over the years, and I guess it is just a staple of this story's depiction; it just seems to try to clone a very effective scene from before. But again, it really is effective, as it sets out to scare, and it does.

This was before Jason adopted the hockey mask as his trademark, and I have to say, the pillow case with an eyehole is a lot scarier; it's reminiscent of ""The Elephant Man,"" which was itself a true story. And when we finally do see Jason, his deformities are consistent with the way he looked in the first film; it was a very good age-progression, ignored beyond Part Three.

This film has the same look, sound, and features as the other film on this disc, a French audio track along with English, and Spanish subtitles, letterboxing, the same film qulity, the same look, same sound, and so on. So you could say it's a three-hour movie, with a gap in the middle.

242898,4,6300214192,"I've always felt that the Friday The 13th movies, especially the early ones, are imitations of Halloween. There are so many similarities between this movie and the original Halloween by John Carpenter. I view it as just Halloween done all over again, except the setting is a campground by a lake and there is lots of blood and gore, unlike in Halloween. If you watch this movie, you'll notice striking similarities to Halloween, everything from what the teenagers are doing throughout the movie to the methods of shooting certain scenes (such as from the perception of the killer using a Panaglide camera and not showing the killer's face for the first half of the movie). And look at what Jason is wearing over his head. It's white, and it's a mask, bottom line. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give away too much and go into specific detail.

Now, how is the movie itself? Well, I saw this movie for the first time in 1982 on cable TV. I thought the movie was terrifying and it really stuck with me and I've never forgotten it. I saw this movie for the second time last night - 27 years later. My experience was entirely different - I view this film differently now. The acting in this movie is fair to poor and kind of campy. I couldn't help but do a comparison with the movie that this movie imitates, Halloween. The acting in Halloween is so much better. Why am I comparing this movie to Halloween? It's because there's absolutely no question that the Friday The 13th movies are Halloween knock-offs. Anybody with half a brain will tell you that. Michael Myers paved the way for Jason and Freddie Krueger and other villains. It's the truth, it's not my opinion.

The storyline basically is that a group of teenagers want to spend a few days at Camp Crystal Lake. There is a legend around the area that a kid named Jason Voorhees drowned in the lake five years earlier and his mother had her head chopped off by one of the teenage campers (in the first movie). Jason comes back to terrorize the teenagers on the campground. The characters seem to be installed in this movie just to be killed off by Jason. You never really get to know the characters. Blood is plentiful. There is quite a bit of nervous suspense, much like in Halloween, but less effective. The score to the movie is much less effective than Halloween, though I do think it's unique and does work somewhat. You won't see Jason in his famous hockey mask in this film. That comes in later films (I believe Part III was the first to have Jason wearing the hockey mask). I've only seen two Friday The 13th movies - this and the first one.

If you like slasher films with blood and suspense, then see this movie. I think it's mediocre to pretty good. Not bad. Could have been better. Grade: B",1256169600,2,2767,4.453648915187377

Rumors have it that Jason Voorhees (Warren Gillette) is still alive and wants revenge for his dead mother as more counselors are being killed one by bloody one.

A bloody sequel to a 1980 slasher box-office hit classic that is well paced and exciting all the way. This is the one that has Jason Voorhees as the killer rather then his mother as the studio decided to have Jason as the killer when the first movie was a box-office smash in the summer of 1980. Betsy Palmer from the original movie does an appearence as Jason's mother but in a memory and Jason here doesn't don his famous hockey mask until the next movie but here he wears an Elephant-Man burlap sack over his disfigured face, the body count is much higher then last time with some fine gore like icepick to the skull and machete to the face. This one offers good timely scares, violent kills and made Jason the icon of horror in the 80's next to Freddy Krueger.

242903,4,6300214192,"When the first Friday the 13th film made over $30 million at the box office on a less-than-$1 million budget, Paramount instantly began production on a sequel. Released a year later in 1981, Friday the 13th: Part 2 isn't much different from it's predecessor. In fact, it follows the formula of the first film so closely it's hardly a different movie. This is good and bad. Bad, if you like variety. Good, if you just want an effective slasher film.

A description of the plot isn't entirely necessary but...Five years after the events of the first movie, camp counselors arrive at a summer camp that is located on Camp Crystal Lake. Everyone knows the story about the young boy Jason, whose body was never recovered after he supposedly drowned. They also know about his demented mother. They think that the nightmare is over, but someone is lurking around the campgrounds and it's not long before the bodies begin to pile up.

This is, as you likely know, the movie that introduced the film world to Jason Voorhees, sans the ski mask. Writer Ron Kurz had to be frustrated when he was hired to pen this script. He really had nothing to work with from the first movie to work with. By making Jason a villain instead of a victim he created a horror icon. Too bad the ski mask doesn't appear until the next film.

Jason wears what basically looks like a pillowcase to mask his facial deformities. When he actually appears like this, it's not frightening or intimidating. It's actually almost funny.

I bring this up only because Friday the 13th: Part Two actually has some genuine scares and suspense, even. It actually has less ""cheap scares"" than the first film and the scene of Jason without the pillow-case in the last few minutes of the movie is actually rather effective. More so when I was younger, but still memorable.

I'm not a huge fan of slasher films generally. I believe if you've seen one you've basically seen them all. However, if one can make you jump a little bit and not completely insult your intelligence with horrible acting and low production values, than I will favor it. With a brisk 85-minute running time and some good moments, I think this does deserve to stand alongside the first film. It's not perfect nor is it a masterpiece...But if you're a fan of the slasher genre than you can certainly pass the time with this.

Whereas the blu-ray of Part 1 is overzoomed-in, this actually shows more of the picture than the previous DVD releases.  I think they did a great job on the transfer...the only grain I see is the original film grain from the low-budget cameras they used back then...it looks the way it is meant to look.  I absolutely loved it, and found myself saying numerous times during the movie 'this looks SOO AWESOME!!!'  And I am as critical as they come, I can assure you.

The special features are decent...aside from the Lost Tales from Camp Blood short film crap--those are all just pitiful and should be destroyed.

Otherwise my only complaint is we need a director's cut of this one...there is some really great footage missing here...I know we've been saying it for years, but man oh man, add that to the awesome quality of this BD, get rid of the Lost Tales crap, and I'll buy it again.

Or even something like what they did with 'Slashed Scenes' feature on the DVD of Part 4...they basically gave you every bit of film that wasn't used surrounding those death scenes as an extra...no audio or color correction or anything, but great quality and it's all there.  I was actually able to splice in some extra gore, color correct it (the best I can with what I have), do some audio-looping & editing tricks, and make my own director's cut of it in Windows Movie Maker.  I would love to do that with Part 2!!!!

242905,3,6300214192,"FRIDAY THE 13TH PART II BLU-RAY

*** Out of 5

The Blu-ray release for Friday the 13th Part II is the same release as the Deluxe Edition DVD; while I haven't seen the Deluxe Edition DVD if you have that odds are it won't be worth buying on Blu-ray since the features are the same and while it will probably look slightly better I don't think it will look that much better to warrant an upgrade, but if you only have the SD DVD the sound and picture quality alone is worth the upgrade.

This is the same R-rated cut as we've gotten in the past and the footage is nowhere to be found and Paramount may have cheated us in the past I think their claims are legit. With all the SE releases they have given the movies if they had the footage they would have included it as either a feature or in the movie. So if you're holding out hopes that Paramount releases an unrated version odds are you'll never see one; with that out of the way onto the release.

Really lame feature, which has nothing to do with the movie; all this feature provides is a brief look at the convention scene; I'm not really sure why this even made the disc. I suppose this would work as a filler feature, but due to the weakness of the other features it makes this even worse.

LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD PART II (HD) 8:54
Directed by Andrew Ceperley I found this to be entertaining, but the daytime scenes take away from it. It was enjoyable for what it was worth though, but I'd rather have something about Friday the 13th Part 2.

JASON FOREVER (SD) 29:47
This was shot in 2004 for the Crystal Lake to Manhattan set, but it was only a Best Buy Exclusive; Peter Bracke moderates and Ari Lehman, Warrington Gillette, C.J. Graham and Kane Hodder appear; this was an entertaining feature, but nothing we haven't heard before; Steve Dash is the one who actually played Jason in part 2, Gillette was hired for the role and is credited in the movie, but only played him for the unmasking scene at the end hence why that is all he talks about. Overall I liked the feature, but again I would have rather seen more about Part 2.

THEATRICAL TRAILER (HD) 2:12
No need to explain this one.

TRANSFER
This is an upgrade over the SD DVD for sure and even though I haven't seen the Deluxe Edition DVD they are both from the same source and any upgrade probably won't be that noticeable in general. But overall the transfer was excellent; it's not as good as the transfer for the original, but light years ahead of the 2D HD transfer for part 3. Seeing as the film was released in 1981 you cannot expect perfection, but this transfer cleans up a lot of the grain and dirt and the colors are strong and sharp and it's not as dark looking as the SD DVD; like I said this transfer isn't as good as the original, but it comes really close at times. I was surprised at how clean the movie looked. The only scene where the grain was bad was when Ginny and Paul are driving to the bar, but it's not a big deal since it was only a shot of the sky, but besides that one scene grain and dirt are kept very low. I was hesitant on if I should pick this up, I loved the transfer for the original, but hated the 2D transfer for part 3, but no doubt this is a winner. It may not be the perfect Hi-Def experience, but it looks amazing. It's not as dark and murky as the SD DVD and is brighter and no worries the movie doesn't lose its low budget charm. Again I have to say I was quite surprised at how great the picture quality was.

AUDIO

The 5.1 Dolby TrueHD I just wasn't that impressed with; the music sounded good, but I felt the dialogue was a bit low. You can easily understand everything that is said, but I wasn't really into the audio. I felt the same for part 3 and like that one I watched the movie with the original Mono track. While the shrieks from the score might have more of a jolt with the TrueHD I felt the Mono track was the overall better of the two.

FINAL WORDS ON THE DISC
Friday the 13th Part II was a solid entry in the series and far better than most people will give it credit for, in a sense this is the original with a higher budget and a new villain. The characters are pretty much the same as those in the original and the pacing is mostly the same. Even though this is a rehash of the original it serves its purpose as an entertaining and creepy slasher flick, but the release was quite poor. While the picture and audio alone make this a major upgrade from the SD DVD the special features really aren't very special. It would be nice if some people involved with the movie took part in the release and due to that this disc is a failure; Peter Bracke does a good job at supplying info on the movie there was still far more that could have been done. So while the disc is a winner in picture and audio it's a total failure in terms of extras. But again the Blu-ray is more than worth it for the excellent transfer and that is why I give it 3-stars; I would rate it higher, but taking the overall product into account the features take away from it.",1246406400,5,5613,4.216014897579144

242958,4,6300214192,"Nope, sorry boyles and ghouls the uncut version of this film is not included on this new disc.  It's the same as the previous releases, but with a better picture and much better sound.  Though, on the documentary His Name Was Jason you can grab a gander at some on-set stills from the famous but always deleted double penitration by spear scene.  That's the best you're going to get for now.  Hopefully, in 20 years or so we will get the right elements for these films to be released uncut and uncensored.  I'm happy to have the first one uncut, but I would be really bummed to never see part 7 without Director Buechler's over-the-top gore kills.  Maybe the Deluxe Edition of that one will have it reinstated.  If you have any info regarding that, be a cool cat and throw it my way.

This film starts the series proper by giving us its star Jason Vorhees, despite the fact that the first film clearly stated that he drown as a child, hence his mother's killing spree.  He's still retarded, but now he's a fully grown hill-billy to boot, with no explanation for the latter. Maybe Mrs. Vorhees was just so nutty about being anti-sex that she made the whole thing about her son up?  Dunno.  Doesn't really matter when it comes to this series either. The continuity only gets more loopy as the franchise rolls on.  Jason was only scary in a true way briefly in this series and this is on e of them, about three sequels before he became the series hero and all that mattered were elaborate gore kills.

Amy Steel steals the movie as the best final girl in the entire series.  She's pretty enough and seems real and nextdoor-ish enough to elicit sympathy, plus she's totally likeable.  Most the other chracters do the same, but it's a slasher film and at the end of the day, we know that most of them will have a really bad end of the day.  A wheelchair clad boy buys it too and it could've come off mean-spirited but rather works as a great shock moment and was truly unexpected as far as the grammar of what you can and can't do on film goes.  Jason himself is a great concept desgin in this film.  His wardrobe is simple but borrow heavily from Deliverance.  The make-up effects used to create his carnage and his revealed face are quite excellent, even better then the Savini work in part 1.  Though you only get to see Jason's gnarled visage in a glimpse during the climax it will truly burn itself into your mind forever.  Jason wears an Elephant Man-like sack throughout the majority of the film and I find its blankness more effective then his eventual hockey mask, similar to the white blankness of Michael Myers shape mask in Halloween.

The new Deluxe Editon is a real let down ultimately.  Steve Miner was and still is a fairly mediocre but competent director(with the exception of Warlock, that flick is AWESOME) but he seems to not want to be involved with anything Friday the 13th these days, not even for a decent retro featurette!  If he could do a commntary track for his misguided and thoroughly crappy remake of Day Of The Dead then why not for the film that help establish him in in Hollywood?  There's no trace of him on this disc or previous box sets, unless he's being referred to by the cast or crew.  These references I'm referring to can only be heard on the Killer Extras disc from the From Crystal Lake To Manhattan box set, so if you're a hardcore Jason fan, I wouldn't get rid of it if you still have it.  You also get some inside dope from the cast and crew on the recently released His Name Was Jason two disc set from Anchor Bay.

What we do get, besides a great new transfer, is a brief interview with the author of the coffee table book Crystal Lake Memories.  It helps fill in some of the production that the filmmakers could have easily provided had they contributed.  The only thing it doesn't address is why Steve Miner doesn't talk about these films.  It's far too brief though.  We also get a featurette about Friday the 13's cast and creators at horror conventions.  We get some shallow but funny insight from fans on why they love Jason so much and why the cast and creators love their fans.  Then we get the second segment in a short film series called Crystal Lake Memories that's lame and worth watching once, and then only maybe.  We also get the original theatrical trailer and finally we get a feature called Jason Forever.  Jason Forever is a panel discussion with all the stuntmen and actors who played Jason throughout the series.  It's a hold over from the previous box set, it was a bonus disc, at least if you bought it from Best Buy, but its cool and informative to see all the guys who played Jason side by side sharing their on set stories.  That's it.  Pretty lame if you ask me.

This film deserved better as far as special features go but it has never looked better in a home theatre format.",1245110400,6,4848,4.421645997745209
242959,4,6300214192,"It's been five years since that fateful night Alice beheaded Pamela Voorhees. Unfortunately for Alice, Jason, Mrs. Voorhees son, saw everything. A camp located near Camp Crystal Lake opens up and its flooding with counselors. Everything seems to be going fine until a few of them decide to go exploring the infamous Camp Blood. From there, it's a bloodbath and Jason Voorhees is finally introduced as the killer of this franchise.

I'm one of the people who thinks the bag is scarier than the hockey mask, so I'm a pretty big fan of this one. While I was watching it this time around though, it just reminded me of The Town That Dreaded Sundown since the killer also wears a bag over his head. I think I give both films a similar rating, as well. Weird. There were a few things that crossed my mind during this viewing though. Like when everyone in camp goes to town and only a few counselors stay behind, Paul says they only have two cars. They take the two cars and drive off into town. Then when Vickie is getting ready for her evening with Mark, she runs out...to her car. These films definitely aren't without their flaws obviously, but the majority of them are still a lot of fun. I also loved the pitchfork even though you never really got to see it used on anyone. Seeing Ralph finally get offed wasn't too shabby either. One thing that kind of left me scratching my head was the ending. Ginny gets carted off into an ambulance, but that's it. You don't see Jason's body or Paul's. Nobody is saying anything other than Ginny. Did Paul die? Did Jason get away? Did Ginny dream the whole thing? Was it Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the dining room? Nobody knows.

The second installment of the series is the first to feature Jason as the killer, but without the trademark hockey mask that would later mark every other Friday film. The film isn't all that much different from the first and that is why I give it only a 2 1/2 star rating. Jason hasn't peaked at this point, but he would soon do so!

A group of Camp Councelors arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to set up the camp before the kids arrivein a couple of week. As the day goes on and turns to night the teens start getting killed off one-by-one.

When you first see Jason (with his pillow case for a mask) he looks really scary but after about 10 seconds he looks kinda funny. Hard to imagine a psychopathic killer wearing pillowcase over his head, it made him look a bit like a demented nun.

Death scenes weren't very gory because of all the controvery surrounding the first moving, but they were shown on screan and still featured some blood, so it's not too big a dissapointment.

Overall, a good sequel (but not as good as the origional movie). Would deffinatly reccomend to slasher fans or anybody who liked Friday the 13th.",1237593600,,1031,4.444444444444445

The transfer is the same as the previous DVD release, but it is the bonus features that make this an improvement. This has Crystal Lake Memories, Camp Blood Part 2 and conventions with the Friday the 13th cast & crew.
This picks up where part 1 left off , now Jason is on the loose at the camp, killing off the teens one by one. Mild gore and nudity. The characters are ok. The end of the movie is very similar to part 1 where when you think its over, here comes Jason and it will make you jump. Better than later entries on the series. I feel the first 3 are the best of the series and at least the stories were fresh despite obvious rip-offs of Psycho and Halloween. And yes Id like to see Jason vs Michael Myers...

242987,4,6300214192,"FRIDAY THE 13TH PART II

**** Out of 5

Release Date- May 1st, 1981

Running Time- 87-Minutes

Rating- R

Screenplay- Ron Kurz

Director- Steve Miner

Starring- Amy Steel, John Furey, Adrienne King, Kirsten Baker, Stu Charno, Bill Randolph, Lauren-Marie Taylor, Marta Kober, Tom McBride, Walt Gorney and Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees

Many fans of the franchise cite Friday the 13th has being overall better than the original and while I do enjoy part II I don't think it's on the same level as the original movie. The one thing forgotten by a lot of people is the early Friday the 13th movies while were made as cash ins with a large body count they still tried to create suspense and scares. I break the series down in two. The first few were Friday the 13th films and the 2nd half Jason films.

After the unexpected success of Friday the 13th the sequel was pretty much rushed into production and opened just under a year after the original. This time around Jason Voorhees makes his debut as the killer, which really doesn't make any sense. If he did drown as a child how did he come back? And if he didn't drown as a child where as he been all this time? I suppose it really doesn't matter and since this movie turned a profit it didn't matter to fans either. Friday the 13th Part II was the debut with Jason as the killer and the rest is slasher movie history.

In many ways Friday the 13th Part II is almost a remake of the first film. The basic structure is the same, the characters are a lot like those I the original film Ted is sort of a take on Ned, and Jeff and Sandra remind me a bit of Jack and Marcie; even the final chase scene is shot for shot the same only with new characters.

Writer Ron Kurz does fairly decent with the script; apparently he did some rewrites on the original, but was un-credited. I suppose that is legit seeing as the screenplay here is nothing more than a rehash of the original script just change the name of the characters and add a few more in. The characters lack depth like those in the original and while not totally faceless they lack the identities like the original characters. Overall for a slasher flick, Ron Kurz does write a decent little script even if it mostly rehashes the original.

Steve Miner made his directorial debut and pretty much sticks to the formula that Sean Cunningham did with the original. Steve Miner is an interesting director, despite some success in box office he never really came up with a style of his own. In all his horror flicks he follows the format of other filmmakers like Cunningham, Craven and Carpenter. Though despite not having much of his own style, Miner has been able to make some enjoyable movies and Friday the 13th Part II is one of those enjoyable movies.

Steve Miner never strays from what Sean Cunningham did with the original; he follows the same exact formula and pretty much takes scenes from the original and has them here in the sequel. Despite the total lack of originality, Miner is able to build some decent suspense and tension while able to provide a jump scare or two. Unlike Cunningham, Steve Miner never really sets a creepy tone like Cunningham was able to do. I suppose that is in part due to having his scenes play out the same. But again despite all of that Steve Miner does craft an enjoyable and some what creepy movie. Though the death of Mark was excellent and really set the tone for the remainder of the movie.

Jason Voorhees was played by Steve Dash despite the credits; Gillette only played him in one scene at the end. Jason was actually rather creepy and is always lurking around and unlike the later installments he takes his time and is a bit more methodical sort of like Michael Myers, which works well. Ginny played by Amy Steel is one of the fan favorites of the series with good reason and Paul played by John Furey was also a solid character. Adrienne King returns as Alice in a very small role that is unconnected to the rest of the movie.

Overall Friday the 13th Part II is a fairly solid sequel and while it's nothing more than a rehash of the original with new characters it actually works well and is at times fairly creepy. A lot of fans cite this one as better than the original and I can't help but feel that is due to Jason since with all the sequels it does seem weird without Jason in the original. But regardless, Friday the 13th Part II is a fairly strong slasher flick and comes highly recommended to fans of these kinda movies.",1233964800,2,4479,4.425273390036452

242989,5,6300214192,"This is the best ""Jason"" Friday The 13th flick. The continuity from part one to part 2 was great. Jason is gown up and what I would expect how Jason would look according to the legend. Jason is human, he is clumsy, and not very smart in this movie. I think those elements make him that much more scary. The sack on his head adds to the fright as one hole is cut in the bag to expose his only good eye.
Even though this movie had it's fair share of cuts, the gore is still there and the kills are still quite brutal. The cuts added to the suspense, leaving the kills to your imagination. The hero/heroine tandem of Amy Steel and John Furey is hands down the best of any Friday The 13th movie.
Steve Dash played Jason top notch

This is the best 'Jason Voorhees' Friday The 13th movie, this movie brought Jason Voorhees to be a household name. The characters in the movie were so easy to like and the movie was set in the perfect spot for a sequel to Friday The 13th. Paul, Ginny and Ted (the survivors) were some of the best characters in the entire franchise. I think they set the movie apart, and really made you root for them.

242991,5,6300214192,"In continuing with my reviews of the Friday the 13th series, Part 2 is probably the most important of all films. Not just because we're introduced to Jason Vorhees, but because of the smoking hot actress who plays Ginny, Amy Steel.

Jason is introduced similar to the killer in Part 1, and we don't really see him until the last 20 minutes, a common event since the first movie when the killer stalks the last victim around camp. My only problem (which is very minor) is the transition from 2nd & 3rd movie.

This film takes us deeper into the woods, into the shack of Jason, where he'd been living for the past several years. Jason is 36ish in this movie, born June 13, 1943 & ""died"" in 1956. The first set of murders happened in '58. Part 1 takes place in '78, and part 2 takes place in 82/83. So far, everything matches up in the series. The end of part 2 (or beginning of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Part-3/dp/B00004WZ0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Part 3</a>&nbsp;is were it gets confusing. His clothing and hairstyle have drastically changed, not to mention his face (which we see though he's masked throughout both films) is quite different. Now the 2nd & 3rd movie are supposed to have happened right after one another. And the 3rd & 4th are supposed to have run after one another also. Where are all these bodies coming from? Wouldn't the lake have been quarantined off until the cops found out what was going on? This is explained in being different parts of the lake, where the 3 different films take place. It doesn't make sense, but I guess you have to believe it.

And of course, Amy Steel is in this movie!! I had such a huge crush on her when I was a kid, seeing her in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Ties/dp/B000K7UBXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Ties</a>&nbsp;episode, and later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-Like-a-Man/dp/B00015HVMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk Like a Man</a>&nbsp;with that idiot Howie Mandel (whom I liked until he shaved his head and did that stupid&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/game-show/dp/B000HBS5CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">game show</a>). So seeing her in her glory (and undies) is still a treat. She hasn't done much since, but oh well. That's showbiz!!

The original gets props for originality but not for it's plausibility.
Also ,Amy Steele gives a much better  performance than the original heroine Adrienne King.

The kills in part 2 were better as well as the characters""sorry Kevin Bacon"".
Even though in the first Friday in the end we do get the jolt of a young deformed Jason jumping out of the lake to drag The last girl standing""Alice"" into the water""very scary"".

 In part 2 we get that same jolt when an assumed deceased Jason jumps through the window after the encounter at the shack with ""Genny ""and ""Paul"" where he has set up a shrine to his beheaded mother Pamela Voorhees .At this time in the franchise we didn't know Jason was indestructible so it was fair to assume he was dead even though I was hoping he wasn't ""YET"".
 In Part 2 see him wearing a burlap bag over his face save one eye as well as his hideous face for an instant when ""Genny"" pulls the bag off.""gnarly"".The infamous Hockey mask was not introduced until part 3.

and to reinforce the popular viewpoint that r-rated releases of this are worthless...the censorship of this movie is sloppy and extremely overdone..that NEEDS to be fixed.  the cuts are especially noticeable where there's music playing at the point that they cut it, which is about half of them.  i can't stand feeling like i'm being parented while i'm watching a slasher film in my own home.  censored stuff sucks.

paramount has the footage, no doubt.  they just don't want to spend a little time and money to remaster it and insert it.  that's not easy to do...but if they care and can see that they would profit from it, it could happen.  the question is how to make them aware of it??",1230422400,5,1113,4.685567010309279

243021,5,6300214192,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back to camp . . . here's even more heart-pounding terror.
Five years after the horrible bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, all that remains is the legend of Jason Voorhees and his demented mother Pamela Voorhess(Betsy Palmer), who had murdered seven camp counselors in this flicks predecessor.

At a nearby Summer camp, the new counselors are unconcerned about the warnings to stay away from the infamous site. Carefree, the young people roam the area, not sensing the ominous lurking presence. One by one, they are attacked and brutally slaughtered. Suspense and screams abound in this compelling sequel.

FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART II was quite an upgrade from its predecessor and even better than the original along with the fact that this sequel was a moderate box-office hit that opened in theatres back in the Spring of 1981 in 1st place and was also the first one to feature the hellbent diabolical Jason Voorhees(Warrington Gillette)as the main antogonist, a trend which would be repeated for the rest of the series with the exception of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 5-A NEW BEGINNING.

Now with it being 5 years later; a group of teenagers come to Crystal Lake to reopen the site and set up a new camp and at a bonfire, the head counselor Paul(John Furey)tells the story about Jason and his now deceased mother with everyone aware that Jason is not a legend and is avenging the death of Pamela Voorhees by killing off troubled kids one by one at a Summer camp with Jason wearing a burlap sack only in this sequel since he switches to wearing his famous hockey mask in FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3, which opened in theaters on Friday August 13, 1982.

In addition to what helped make FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2 such a success was it inspired the release of HALLOWEEN 2 in the Fall of 1981 and then the theatrical release of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 in the Summer of 1982 had inspired the theatrical release of HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH in the Fall of 1982.

Following the success of this movies predecessor FRIDAY THE 13TH which was released in the Spring of 1980; Paramount Pictures began plans to make a sequel & insisted on having Pamela's son(Jason Voorhees), despite Jason's appearance in the original was only meant to be a joke, but director(Steve Miner)believed it would be a good idea & would go on to direct the first 2 sequels after Sean S. Cunningham(Director of FRIDAY THE 13TH)opted not to return to the directors chair which was similar to how John Carpenter declined to direct HALLOWEEN II since Carpenter didn't even want to do a sequel to his 1978 masterpiece HALLOWEEN, so Miner used many of the same crew members from the original FRIDAY THE 13TH while working on the sequels just like HALLOWEEN 2's director(Rick Rosenthal)did with HALLOWEEN II.

So if you loved the original FRIDAY THE 13TH, you will more than likely love FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART II.

FRIDAY THE 13TH: PART II also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 since Ronald Reagan was our president when this horror flick was released back in the Spring of 1981.",1227225600,,3155,4.684115523465704

243023,5,6300214192,"As far as I'm concerned, Friday the 13th Part II is the best film in the whole series.  Moms did some nice work, but now it's time for the real killing machine to take over.  Jason doesn't have the hockey mask yet, and he's not yet the seemingly inhuman, unstoppable killing force he will become, but he definitely earned slasher rookie of the year for his efforts in this film.  He doesn't have the scary presence of a Michael Myers, but Jason is all about ruthless, efficient killing.  The first few minutes of the film, featuring flashbacks to the climactic scenes of the original, are pretty annoying, but the rest of this film is a great, unsettling ride.

Frankly, I never cared for Alice (Adrienne King), the sole survivor of the first film, so I had no problem with Jason clearing up the only loose end left by his dear, beheaded mother (speaking of unsettling, poor Adrienne King soon left the business altogether because of an ardent fan who began stalking her).  Once the extended opening scene is out of the way, we head back to Camp Crystal Lake - actually, another campsite on the lake - where a camp counselor training center is drawing a new cast of potential victims right into Jason's backyard.  With the exception of Ted (Stu Charno), I actually liked these young people.  The guys are less annoying and the girls are prettier than those in the first film.  I must admit I was taken aback by the presence of a cute little dog named Muffin being brought into the danger zone, though.  (Do what you want to the people, but I have to draw the line at killing cute little animals.)  Even good old Ralphie is back to warn the kids that they are certainly doomed.  But come on - it's been five years since the last murders, and everyone knows Jason is just a legend, right?

Some guys seem to have a thing for Terri (Kirsten Baker), which probably has something to do with the fact she likes to wear the shortest shirts allowed by law and to go skinny-dipping, but Ginny (Amy Steel) is my girl.  Not only is she cute, she's also a spunky little fighter - and she almost finds an actual use for her psychology degree.  She's not smart enough to figure out that you need to beat the hell out of and slice and dice Jason into about 50 pieces when you have him down, but what are you going to do?  I would say that Vicki (Lauren-Marie Taylor) is pretty hot, too, but I'd better not because she looks like she's about fifteen years old tops.

Jason's appearance in this film is interesting, especially given the fact that he wouldn't don the hockey mask until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-3/dp/B00004WZ0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part 3</a>.  We actually see his face for the first time near the end, but for most of this film, he wears a sack of some kind over his head.  Reportedly, the look was inspired by the killer in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Town-That-Dreaded-Sundown/dp/6303917461/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Town That Dreaded Sundown</a>, but the image that I call to mind is that of the sketch of the Zodiac killer as described by Bryan Hartnell.  (This attack, in which the Zodiac killer murdered Cecelia Ann Shepard and left Hartnell for dead, is the most eerie and frightening attack I have ever read about, which is why I think it makes for a much more frightening image than the vintage Jason hockey mask.)

The ending of this film is surprisingly open-ended, but I guess the filmmakers already had plans for a next installment in the series.  What gets me is the fact that a couple of minor characters I fully expected to see dead actually miss out on all of the murderous fun.  Based on Jason's performance here, their deaths would have made very nice additions to the collection.  If you ever want to visit Camp Crystal Lake, Friday the 13th Part II should be a necessary part of your travel plans.",1225152000,2,3959,4.822485207100592

243025,5,6300214192,"Friday the 13th part 2. A very good sequal. I liked this movie even more than the original. It has undeniable suspense. It has a few really good kills. It has one of the best looking Friday girls (Kirsten Baker). Her nude scene alone is worth the price of admission.

The movie starts off with our heroine from the last Friday the 13th in her apartment. She is feeling a little bit scared by being alone in her dark, empty apartment. What happens next? Well, you will have to see the movie to find out.

The next day we are introduced to the rest of main characters of this film. We are treated to yet another camp setting. Things go well for awhile until murders start to happen. People are disposed of left and right. Who is the one doing all of the murders? Is it the killer from the first movie?

This movie is great from start to finish. It held my interest all the way through. I hadn't seen this movie in quite a few years and remembered that this movie always seemed to be my favorite Friday movie and this time it didn't dissapoint. I loved hearing the speculation some characters had about an urban legend that was supposedly lurking in the woods.

This movie really has an early 80's feel to it, which I like. Right now I am working on building a time machine and when it is complete I plan on going back in time during the filming of this movie. I will warn the producers to save as much of the extra footage as they can so that in the future the rest of us will be able to watch the extra scenes to our heart's delight.",1223164800,5,1532,4.200680272108843
243026,3,6300214192,"The first Friday the 13th movie has its good and bad moments, both of which are entertaining.  It also established a landmark in horror movies and spawned innumerable slasher imitators, and while its I feel Friday the 13th Part 2 is an inferior follow-up to the first movie, it's an important part of the series as it's the first movie where Jason gets his knife on.  So, if you're a fan of both of them and you're looking to conserve some shelf room for My Bloody Valentine or Maniac, you've come to the right place.

THE GOOD:

-Clean, animated menus
-Both movies on one side of the disk (it's not a flipper!)
-Comes in a standard DVD case, so it takes up half the room of both movies packaged separately.

THE BAD:

-This is the exact same disc from the Friday the 13th box set, which isn't a big deal, but shows the limited amount of thought that went into putting this together.
-There's no chapter insert.
-No trailers.
-The yellow.  The original cover art for these movies, while still here, is a foreboding black and red.  Here, it's swallowed up in a chipper yellow frame.  Even the spine/side of the art is yellow, so when you stick it in your DVD case, you'll only be able to recognize it by the bright yellow spine that obscures the titles of the movies, making them tough to read.  Hey, at least it's not as bad as the horrendous ""I Love the 80s"" cover art.

So who is this for?  If you're a fan of the series, you probably have these movies already in better looking cases, and if you just want the best of the series, you're better off with just getting the first movie.  However, if you want to save some room in your DVD case, or want a little Jason with your introduction to the series, then this is an easy way to get the first two.  My two cents?  Get 'em both separately and toss your copy of ""Underworld.""",1219104000,,1827,4.316715542521994

  I watched ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" in a ""Friday the 13th"" marathon that began on Friday, June 13, 2008, Jason's birthday!  ""Friday the 13th Part 2,"" I learned, is an excellent sequel, far better than most other sequels in the horror genre.  As in the original film, we don't see the killer's face until the end, though we strongly suspect who the killer is.  The death scenes, once again, are very gruesome and imaginative.  The director, Steve Miner, must've been highly influenced by the Italian Master of Horror, Mario Bava, who directed ""Bay of Blood"" (a.k.a. ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"").  Some of the scenes from ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" closely resemble those from ""Bay of Blood.""  For example, the machete buried in the crippled man's face and the spear thrown into the couple making love on the bed can also be found in ""Bay of Blood.""  I strongly recommend that you buy the ""Mario Bava Collection Volume 2"" which has ""Bay of Blood"" along with some other Bava classics from the last years of his career.

  In ""Friday the 13th Part 2,"" we learn more about the serial killer's identity than in all the proceeding ones.  He is made to appear as an actual person and not a horrifying creature.  We learn that he is a mentally deficient mongoloid who didn't drown, but ran into the woods to live as a hermit or to be raised by a hermit.  Mistrusting all humans, including his mom, he stayed clear of them; but when he saw his mom die, his fear turned to rage and he had to kill anyone who trespassed in his woods.  Knowing he looks different from the beautiful camp counselors that he so loves to stalk and kill, Jason uses torn bed sheets to hide his face in shame.  We also learn that he pays homage to his mom by surrounding her decapitated head with burning candles.

  ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is a must have for fans of the series and fans of the slasher frenzy that gripped our country between the mid seventies and the mid eighties.",1213833600,6,2204,4.4575

Steve Miner is probably the most accomplished director to take on any of the Friday the 13th films and the quality shows.  The scenes are subtly stylized and photography is the strongest here.  The story is also more compelling and mysterious than the subsequent films.  It partly stands out because Jason is not quite the icon he later becomes.  He is smaller by far here than in any other sequel and he dons a white pillowcase with a single hole for his one eye to peak through.  He wears overalls and his weapon of choice is a pitchfork.  There is something more raw and effortless behind his appearance.  Being the first film with Jason as the killer, we also ask ourselves for the first time how he survived and we don't know for sure until we realize later that it is likely because he is undead.  There is something genuinely creepy about a dead mentally challenged teenage cyclops running around in the woods and hanging out in a shack with his mother's severed rotten head.  It all seems a bit more real than the big brooding invincible zombie of the later films and we still know its Jason in sort of his transition state.  He's just learning the ropes as a mass murderer.

Five years after that, a group of more shallow young people show up to Crystal Lake to attend a camp counselor training.  The camp itself is condemned because of the murders that happened there.  The story of Jason and his mother is of course told around the campfire and the camp is referred to as ""Camp Blood"".  Gradually and as expected, the counselors in training are murdered one-by-one until we are left with just counselors Paul and Ginny.  It is now that we see more of Jason as he fights with Paul in a dark room.  These sequences are actually pretty intense and add some suspense rarely seen in these films.  Eventually we are introduced to Jason's shack with his mother's head and so on during the chase and Jason is eventually killed.  As we know from the series of sequels he doesn't actually die of course.  He leaps through the window at the very end and almost gets the same jump from the audience that he did when he jumped out of the lake as a little boy in the first movie.

Overall, there are some legitimately great moments in Friday the 13th part 2.  The whole climax and all through to the finale is very well done.  There is also a midway scene where a police officer gets a brief glance of Jason running across the street and into the woods.  The policeman follows him into the shack we see at the end of the film and gets a hammer thrown into his head.  That scene really stands out for me.  I'm not sure it was intended to be as eerie as it is, but the brief cut of Jason running into the woods is definitely well handled and convincing.

There is something about this film that sets it apart from the others.  I think it's the fact that it is Jason who is the killer for the first time, and because it is before he becomes the self-parody he does in parts six through ten.  It's hard to take parts three and four as seriously because he resembles the half-comical icon he will eventually become in far lesser movies.  Friday the 13th part 2 is exempt of that connection and it stands on it's on as one of best slasher films I have ever seen.  Then again, that's like saying it is one of best plates of Spam I have ever eaten.",1185321600,18,3582,4.34789156626506
243109,5,6300214192,"Here we have the best two films in the legendary Friday the 13th series. One of the things that really make these movies work well is the scenes where the stalker lurks, stalks, and watches before he or she makes a kill. That plays on the juvenile fear that we all carry in our heads that there is something out there watching you. When you were a kid, your parents always used to tell you to be a good little boy or girl because Santa, The Easter Bunny, or God is watching. If you are bad you will not get a present or you will not go to heaven. The constant here of course is the idea of something watching you, and if you get out of line, there is a consequence. Perhaps, that is the best theme of all that is played out in these early Friday installments.

- Friday the 13th (1980) -

In 1957 a young boy drowns in Crystal Lake. In 1958 two young camp counselors are murdered by an unseen assassin. Years later Steve Christy is preparing Camp Crystal Lake for re-opening despite warnings of the superstitious locals of the ""death curse."" It seems that as a result of the camp's unexplainable dark history the locals suffer from a sort of mass hysteria by attributing unsolved crimes to some sort of ghost story. These new people should have listened to the warnings to stay away from the place the locals call ""Camp Blood,"" because on Friday the 13th 1980, there is a string of horrifying and grizzly murders ending in the beginning of an urban legend come to life.

- Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) -

Five years after the events of the original film, Paul and Ginny are running a summer camp counselor training facility. This place is not exactly at Camp Crystal Lake, but it is on the same like, adjacent to the old (not condemned) murder site. The locals believe that Jason is out in the wilderness as some kind of monster. Some claim to have seen him. Others claim that he is just a legend, a ghost story for the campfire. This film puts the story into the urban legend context, putting the story on the same wave length as Big Foot or Loch Ness or The Jersey Devil.

243110,5,6300214192,"Friday the 13th Part 2 is definitely a worthy sequel and a very good debut of the modern monster Jason Voorhees. Even though Jason has yet to wear his infamous hockey mask, he still comes off as very creepy, kind of like a crazy hillbilly. In reality, his look was based on the killer on the movie ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"", which is another really cool movie if you haven't seen it.

The acting in the movie is about what you would expect from the genre, which isn't that bad actually. The acting isn't important; it is all about the gore and how the kids are killed. The story itself is really cool and explains that in fact, Jason didn't drown, but actually survived and has been living in the forests for all of the years he has been presumed dead. You can see a difference in this Jason later in the series, in this movie, Jason actually is afraid of Jenny with the chainsaw coming after him. In later movies, he wouldn't even bother to move. Overall, this is a really cool movie for fans and a great introduction to the Jason we have come to know and love-without the mask.",1168560000,10,1085,4.344827586206897

You know, I've got a crazy thought. I thought that a store like Amazon would actually want to SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. Having some dork say ""as bad as this movie is"" is not the best way to sell a product.

Onto Friday 2, this movie tells a very good story in the context of an urban legend while developing key characters and building suspense. The deaths are creepy and violent, the music is awesome, and Jason is at his scariest. This film also has the best atmosphere of the series.

This movie could have been the original, despite the original being very good as well.",1165795200,44,749,4.374100719424461
243113,3,6300214192,"I hated the actors in this. They were either in dire need of a haircut (the guys), or in need of a bra (the girls). I don't think any of the actresses in this wore a bra at all.

OK rant over.

The second Friday the 13th movie brings us straight into the movie by removing the original surviving member. Then bring in a whole bunch of pretty people, who will get killed off in new & inventive ways.

Nothing new there eh?

But this time, Jason is the killer - much like Drew Barrymore's phone call in Scream, he wasn't the killer in the first one, it was his mother, trying to get revenge on the camp counsellors who let her son die.

Only, her son didn't drown. (Otherwise he would still be a 12-year-old boy.) He grew into a deformed man (never thinking of giving his mum a quick call to let her know he was alright - but then there would have never been a film franchise, would there?) hell bent on getting revenge, now even moreso, after seeing his mother get beheaded at the end of the last movie.

The infamous hockey mask hasn't appeared yet, instead in its place, is a sack with one eyehole in it. We also get a brief glimpse into the future, when one of the characters wields a chainsaw. But I actually feel sorry for Jason. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but he saw his mother beheaded in front of him, and he was mentally capable of understanding this, and he keeps her decapitated head. All he wants is to be loved, and his mother was the only one who ever really cared for him. So the scene where the actress wears his mother's disgusting jumper was particularly moving, with one eye showing more emotion than a botoxed actress ever could.

We get a brief glimpse of what Jason really looks like at the end of the film, where we see everything that was under the sack, and I mean everything. Prepare to avert your eyes.

The deaths in this include lots of naked girls screaming, a dog, a guy in a wheelchair, and a couple who can't get enough of each other. The latter provides a scene that was actually cut, the double impalement. Not something you want to see when you look over your boyfriend's shoulder when he's on top of you.

The film has one of the longest pre-credit sequences in history, and it almost seems pointless when the credits come on and actually interrupt the film. Just show them over the film!

Although it's good, already by the second movie, I'm feeling it a bit repetitive, and repeating too much of the same stuff that has already featured, or been done better. Fingers crossed it gets better.",1162771200,,2537,4.3446088794926006

243126,3,6300214192,"Chapter 2 of the ""Friday the 13th"" saga follows Part 1 well. Alice, (sole survivor of Part 1) is trying to go on with her life. She has some flashbacks of her confrontation with Mrs Vorhees, and is soon killed by a grown up (at least in body)Jason. 5 years pass by, and a new summercamp opens next to the now off limits Camp Crystal Lake. Interestingly, even though this series started in the early 80s, it really looks more 70sish. (It doesn't start looking 80sish until Part 4.) Moving on, we get to meet the new counselors, including the level headed Paul and the future child psychologist Ginny. Ted offers some welcome comic relief. Jeff and Sandra are a likable couple. Mark is a nice person confined to a wheelchair. Vikki is a friendly girl. The character development in this chapter doesn't quite reach the levels parts 4, 5, and 6 did. But it is there, and some things like Vikki's affection (mingled with sympathy) for the wheelchair bound Mark are touching. Moving forward, around a camp fire, Paul tells the group of the events of Part 1 and hints at what is to come in this movie. Naturally, Paul and the counselors come to see at least the thing about Jason as a joke. (Now we know it won't be a joke, but comic relief often parallels the main plot somehow.) We do get to know the counselors a little, and for awhile they just go about getting the camp ready. Later, Jeff and Sandra get caught trying to visit the camp grounds from Part 1. While they get caught by a police officer, it's the police officer who suffers a worse fate. Jason naturally appears and starts knocking off the camp counselors. While this sacrifices the plausibility of Part 1, it takes on an interesting symbolic meaning. Basically, Jason's killings symbolize the unpopular boy (or the geek in less censored language) getting his revenge on the popular and well like boys and girls. This is more prevalent when Ginny starts to fear the possibility of Jason's existence and uses her child psychology to explain the situation. (""He never had any friends...The only person who ever loved him was his mother."") While some people just like to watch killing, it is most probably the symbolic portrayal of a geek getting his revenge on popular people that accounts for the popularity of this series. Moving on, Ginny turns out to be the 'lucky one' who has the final confrontation with Jason. If you are reading this, you probably already know how Ginny uses her knowledge of child psychology to combat Jason. (While Alice used simple violence to defeat Mrs. Vorhees, Ginny takes a more interesting approach.) Personally, my favorite chapter will always be Part 6. But this 2nd chapter is done fairly well and worth the time. INTERSTING LOOK AHEAD SIDE CHEAT: In Part 1, Mrs. Vorhees refers to Jason as her 'only child.' Well, in chapter 9, the writers decided to cheat a little. Jason is given a sister, as well as a niece, and a once removed niece. So not only does Mrs. Vorhees get a daughter, but she also gets a granddaughter, and great granddaughter as well.",1151280000,,3047,4.634011090573013
243127,3,6300214192,"Here we are, back in the 80's again. There's more short shorts, more gratuitous nudity, and more atrocious acting! Despite a total lack of any purpose or redeeming value whatsoever, Friday the 13th Part 2 does manage to entertain it's audience. Jason himself finally gets into the action in this sequel, finding interesting ways to off all those fun loving camp counselors guilty of the abominable sin of being hormone driven young adults. A decent amount of gore is present for all the horror fans, along with plenty of exposed female flesh and girls running around in the skimpiest outfits known to mankind.

There seems to be a bit of a contradiction in how Jason is handled in this film. Jason is simultaneously presented both as a mindless, simian force of nature, and an intelligent hunter bent on purifying the world of perceived evil. Despite being a plodding, and presumably at least partially retarded, hulking man who couldn't sneak up on a blind and deaf person, Jason is able to stealthily work his way through forests to garrote people from behind, as well as tracking down and killing a woman whose name, address, and phone number he would have no possible way of obtaining. Of course, attempting to rationalize anything that occurs in an 80's slasher flick is an effort in futility. Although the killer is different, the flow of the movie is nearly identical to the original Friday the 13th. Campers are warned not to go the camp, people see the killer and are immediately dispatched without warning the others, and finally one lone character is left to have an exceedingly drawn out chase scene through the woods. While the formula was tired and stale to begin with, it's at least done more convincingly here than in the original.

There is some great humor in the movie, and some of it is even intentional, which is rare in this genre. A half heard joke, with the prominently articulated punchline ""....so the bear wipes his *ss with the rabbit!"" is executed so perfectly that the viewers will be laughing uncontrollably for the rest of the movie. The unintentional humor is no less funny, with several ""Did that really just happen?"" moments that permeate nearly all horror movies. For example, a girl enters a cabin trying to find a paralyzed man who is in a wheelchair. When he isn't immediately found, where does she go to look for him? Up the flight of stairs to the second floor, of course, as that would be the first place a wheelchair bound individual would go! A few of the actors do a commendable job of portraying their characters, but for the most part the level of acting is honestly appalling. As this is a very common theme in movies of this style, I'm almost tempted to believe people in the 80's actually spoke this way, reading incredibly lame and cheesy lines to one another with no feeling or life whatsoever.

Fans of the slasher films from the days of yore will certainly delight in this particular piece of cinema. The average film goer will notice that there is a direct correlation between the enjoyment you'll get out of a Friday the 13th movie, and the amount of alcohol you've imbibed prior to starting the film.",1149465600,,3157,4.715579710144928
243128,2,6300214192,"I'm not a fan of the first entry of the F13 series. I learn more towards pts. 4 and on, with The New Blood (pt 7) being my favorite. I will say that part 2 is a step up from its predecessor. The pace is much quicker, and the characters are given a little more time to develop. And it is here that Jason is introduced as the manic revenge driven monster that he is. It's really not explained why Jason lived alone as long as he did without making contact with his mother if he knew she was alive as well.

 Actually, a part that I like about the movie is when our lead heroine played by Amy Steel gives sympathy to Jason by saying that all he has known is himself and his manicness is nothing short of having to deal with having no life to be with and seeing his mother murdered. Good scene, good acting from Amy Steel - which is why she's one of my favorite heroines from the series. She gave a strong show, and wasn't as annoying as Adrienne King (who in this film is given her ""justice"" according to me).

 Friday the 13th 2 did what all sequels should do. It upped the ante, went by quicker, laid down the rules of the later entries along with a bit of a backstory for Jason, and showed more gore. Yes, gore is famous in the F13 movies. Although I am still upset about some of the offscreen kills and obviously edited kills. F13s are also famous for those.

 I just want to let it out that I thoroughly enjoyed Tom McBride as Mark, the guy in the wheelchair. For some reason, his character - although short-lived - is also one of my favorites in the series. He had more depth in his performance than any of the thin characterizations from the first film.

 Friday the 13th 2 is definitely a step up from the first one, and the remainder of the series never took a step down.",1149120000,2,1777,4.145348837209302

The music is just as bad but the acting is in fact a bit better. The special effects look and are cheap even by the time when the movie was made and that is not a good thing at all. The script is better developed and Jason reminds me alot of variation or a very demented version of Norman Bates. The acting is on a better high school level and the murders are your typical slasher flick scenes. The murders are quite subtle though and do not show as much gore as in many other slasher movies or later sequells in this series. But if one does not expect anything more then a decent slasher flick then one will not be disapointed. I give it 3/5 stars and it rightly deserves it.",1145750400,,803,4.0886075949367084

Sure enough, due to the excellent response of it's predecessor, a sequel was made two years after.  One wondered just how could the storyline continue considering Mrs Voorhees demise in Friday the 13th.

It is a couple of months later and Alice (Adrienne King), the sole survivor of Camp Blood, is recovering back home.  But unforunately for Alice, evil never dies.  A mysterious 'assailant' breaks in and brutally murders her.  She is never seen again.  A year later, Camp Crystal is re-opened, much to the disgust of Crazy Ralph and other residents in the town.  Since Mrs Voorhees is dead, what can possibly go wrong?

The new group of camp councillors are slightly freaked as one would imagine but determined to ignore Camp Crystal's bloody past.  But someone else won't let them forget...

Two months after her encounter with Mrs. Voorhies, Alice is recovering at home when she is attacked and stuck in the temple with an icepick.  She disappears after that without a trace.

Five years later, a new campground has opened up close by the old Camp Crystal Lake.  Once again, the area is covered with young camp counselors.  The leader of the group is Paul Holt (John Furney) and he is assisted by Ginny Field (Amy Steel).  The counselors are there to take refresher courses in swimming, archery, and life saving.  The counselors are told about the happenings at Camp Crystal Lake, but of course none of them believe it and think it was just a legend.  Naturally, some of them have to check out the area for themselves.  Unfortunately for them, they find out that Jason Voorhies is not a legend.

Jason's first appearance (minus his famous hockey mask) was somewhat disappointing.  He just didn't seem to be as menacing as he is in later movies.

Five years after the Friday The 13th massacre at Camp Crystal Lake, Paul Holt (John Furey) reopens a camp counselor training center near the infamous Camp Blood. After a group of counselors show up for some off-season training two counselors (Jeff Randolph and Marta Kober) try and sneak a peak at the legendary Camp Blood. A nosy cop (Jack Marks) picks them up and brings them back to the Paul's camp. On his way out he spots a hooded figure dart across the road, and naively goes in after him. The figure turns out to be the murderous Jason Voorhees, seeking revenge for his mother's death five years earlier. Later on that night a group of counselors head out for one last party before the real training begins. With the camp seemingly desolate and barren Jason comes in to stalk and kill each and every counselor.

Meanwile at the bar Ginny (Amy Steel) and Paul (John Furey leave Ted (Stu Charno) to head back to the camp to find a bloodbath.

[good things]

This is the best ""Jason"" Friday The 13th flick. The continuity from part one to part 2 was great. Jason is gown up and what I would expect how Jason would look according to the legend. Jason is human, he is clumsy, and not very smart in this movie. I think those elements make him that much more scary. The sack on his head adds to the fright as one hole is cut in the bag to expose his only good eye.

Even though this movie had it's fair share of cuts, the gore is still there and the kills are still quite brutal. The cuts added to the suspense, leaving the kills to your imagination. The hero/heroine tandem of Amy Steel and John Furey is hands down the best of any Friday The 13th movie.

Steve Dash played Jason top notch. Next to Richard J. Brooker in Friday The 13th Part 3, Dash is the best actor to ever play Jason.

[the bad]

The ending of the movie is still a mystery. What happened to Paul? did he die? Did John Furey quit? According to John Furey himself, Paul did not die, and John Furey did not quit and walk off the set. The ending was left open for the sake of a sequel.

There really isn't many things I disliked about this movie. I really would like to see the cut footage. It was also a shame that Ted (Stu Charno) did not have more time on-screen. It also left a slight taste of disgust in my mouth when I saw Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney), the only survivor in part one (other than characters not really involved with the plot) get offed by Jason.

[final thoughts]

This is the best 'Jason Voorhees' Friday The 13th movie. I am a HUGE fan of Part 3, but this movie brought Jason Voorhees to be a household name. The characters in the movie were so easy to like and the movie was set in the perfect spot for a sequel to Friday The 13th. Paul, Ginny and Ted (the survivors) were some of the best characters in the entire franchise. I think they set the movie apart, and really made you root for them.",1136246400,,2905,4.273224043715847
243155,4,6300214192,"Whenever a sequel to any movie (horror or otherwise)is made, it's usually just a rehash of the original with maybe a few different elements thrown in.  This is no different, except for the fact that Jason is now doing all the killin' (or moralizing, whichever you prefer)instead of his mother.  Not too much blood or gore, but it definitely delivers in the jump-out-of-your-seat scare department...ESPECIALLY the last scene.  One thing you can tell is that it was a fairly rushed production.  I mean, it came out less than a year after the original film premiered.  And, like the first movie alot of editing had to be done to secure an R rating from the MPAA.  Here, you see a grown-up Jason wearing a bag on his head (reminiscent of a KKK member) and some raggedy overalls.  Jason didn't get his hockey mask until part 3 (and thank goodness for that, otherwise this series would have not lasted as long as it did if he still had that damn bag)!  Alot of fans treat this one pretty shabby.  Along with Part 5, this is probably the least favorite of fans of the series.  I actually like this one, and am quite fond of part 5 as well.  Ginny (this movie's scream queen) is one of the better female heroines of the entire franchise (part 7's Tina and part 4's Trish are also notable as better female leads).  There are actually quite a bit of memorable death scenes here too (the dude in the wheelchair, the guy in the rope trap, the double impaling), but I'd have to say that Jason's ""death scene"" for this one was pretty weak.

243158,4,6300214192,"This was the first sequel to the original Friday the 13th to be shout. There were11 other films maybe after this if you count Freddy versus Jason and the futuristic recenntly release Friday the 13th part ten from back in middle of 2003 or early 2004.  I recomend that if you are under 15 you do not watch these film unsupervised. The one surviving counseler killed miss Vhoroes and made it of but that just spewed on Jason. Some power from  beyond the world of living the devil or some demon brought back jason in a stronger adult body. This film is slight less scarier than the seqeuels I think Jason is a little bit less broad because this is like a teenage version he were a bed sheet which is not as intemdiating as the mask. After the surving counseler is brutally murder Jason returns to the lake to killing any one else who steps on the camp ground where his mother was killed. Can jason be stopped and how can a child who was supposedly dead 30 years ago  come back to life. The answer is not clear but if  you loved the gore and thrills this one will be even better. Recommend for 17 to 105 due to equal amounts of villiance, and gory most like the original and thematic elements and mild occasional brief cursing. If you love Jason whether he's smack d0own or he's getting smacked this series will be a thrilling for any thrilling seekin adult kid who can stomach it. Will any one get out alive find out in the thrilling conclusion.",1130112000,,1442,4.349442379182156
243159,4,6300214192,"FRIDAY THE 13TH was a box office success, and one of the most influential horror flicks below HALLOWEEN and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, which were both superior in that respect. FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 2 isn't necessarily a strong entry in the series, but it's the introduction to our new killer, Jason Voorhees, a character who would become landmark in the horror genre, joining the ranks of such heavyweights as Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers.

This movie picks up right where the first one left off, with a re-imaging of the final events of the first movie. However, Alice's survival would be short-lived, and within the first ten minutes of the movie she is dispatched with by Jason. Enter another hormone-driven teenage population, and while they were not quite as good as the original cast, they were great victims for Jason to kill off, one by one. The fact that he did not wear the hockey mask only in this movie is actually interesting and I think wearing a piece of cloth over the head made him a bit amusing. But take note: Jason's not to be taken lightly. His kills are anything but painless, and as each teen counselor is dispatched with, the motives become clear. Jason's going to avenge the death of his mother. The way the poor guy in the wheelchair was dispatched with was painful, and the way his wheelchair flies down the steps...Jason was pissed. Betsy Palmer makes a brief cameo in this movie in the end scene where Amy Steel's character, Ginny, puts on mother's sweater (disgusting) and tries to trick him into believing that she is ""mother"". It works briefly, but then as soon as she tries to cut his head off, he sees the head of his dead mother and reacts quickly, and the ending ultimately leaves an opening for the next installment.

While all in all not a bad movie, it's not what the first one or some future installments would be. But this is the movie that brought Jason to the forefront, and that's what really makes this worthwhile for any fan of the series.",1130112000,2,2003,4.607843137254902
243160,4,6300214192,"I'm writing this review for one reason I was at a Horror Convention this week in Florida. They had live Q&A panel talking about Friday the 13th parts 1-4. Anyway Tom Savini was on this panel who worked on parts 1-4 and so was Steve Dash! Steve Dash was the main stunt man on Friday the 13th part 2. He was asked to play Jason because of all the physical stunts that he was going to have to do! When I was at the convention the ""Real Jason"" Steve Dash who has never received credited for playing Jason told us that he would never share the stage with Warrington Gillete who only played Jason at the end of the film when he is unmasked! Steve's name is not even in the credits! Tom Savini who headed up all special effects confirmed this! So the guy you see running around in the burlap sack on this head is stunt man Steve Dash not this other guy who got all the credited for playing this version of Jason and takes all of it too! Which by the way this performance is considered one of the best among horror fans!",1129507200,,1012,4.1421319796954315
243161,5,6300214192,This time.... Jason is the killer. He dosen't wear the hockey mask yet. I liked the way he killed everybody. What a great movie!,1124064000,,128,4.375
243162,3,6300214192,alrite it is not scary but it is fun and that is what makes friday te 13th series specail i liked the death scenes especaily the impalment i thought that wa verry original and not as good as the original still worth watching,1122854400,,224,4.232558139534884
243163,5,6300214192,In the previous installment Jason must of witnessed his mothers death and is now really pissed off. In the first ten minutes he kills off Alice from the first film. He then goes to a camp counselor training camp. He then kills them off one (or two) at a time. The main character then returns to find everybody dead and then meets the sack faced Jason in his first film. One interesting kill in this film is when Jason axes a crippled guy in the face and he falls down some steps in his wheelchair. I do prefer Jason with his hockey mask but his weird mask in this film isn't too bad. This entree starts the increase in body count which started at like 9 in the first and eventually reaches about 20 in part 5. I recommend you buy the box set instead because it is a lot cheaper tan buying each of these films seperately.,1121385600,3,820,4.19620253164557
243194,5,6300214192,"This review refers to the Paramount DVD edition of the film.

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Amy Steel, John Furey, Adrienne King, Kirsten Baker, Stu Charno, Warrington Gillette, Walt Gorney, Marta Kober, Tom McBride, Bill Randolph, Lauren-Marie Taylor, Russell Todd, Betsy Palmer. Score Composed By Harry Manfredini. Produced and Directed By Steve Miner. (R) For Violence, Very Mild Gore, Profanity, Suggested Drug Use, Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 87m.; 1981.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Five years (screen time) have passed since the original camp massacre. Now, a new batch of eager camp counselors-in-training are unwittingly awaiting their turn at the slaughter after opening an installation on the same lake where the first nightmarish incident occurred. This film presents one of those exceptionally rare materializations when a sequel lives up to its predecessor. Steve Miner, associate producer from the first film, takes over directorial duties from series creator Sean S. Cunningham and succinctly runs with the ball. His direction is taut and accomplished, keeping the pace moving at a brisk level. The new counselors fill their roles with more than good looks and generic acting (as was the case with the original). They're given better dialogue, craftier one-liners and more opportunity to stretch their skills. Stu Charno is a delight as this film's comic cut-up Ted, who provides a small relief from the consistent onslaught of suspense. Amy Steel, as Ginny, proves to be a more versatile leading lady than Adrienne King ever hoped to be. While the desolate loneliness that drenched the original film is slightly overshadowed here, this sequel makes up for the loss by providing an intensity the first film couldn't muster. The final, almost twenty minute chase scene and showdown against Jason Voorhees (Warrington Gillette) is one of the most tense moments to appear in any of the eight original ""Friday"" films. But the success of this film doesn't lie solely in its cast and director. Harry Manfredini has returned, having obviously grown more comfortable with his eerie score. He nurtures his themes like a parent would a child, presenting an accomplished backdrop for the movie. On a small side note, don't expect to see an immediately recognizable Jason in this movie. Instead of wearing his trademark hockey mask, he adorns himself in a white sackcloth hood with one eyehole. He wouldn't acquire the infamous hockey mask until the third entry. Overall, this film is one of the dominant reasons why the Jason Voorhees saga would become such a long-running institution in the realm of terror. Fright fans can fully immerse themselves in this sequel and take away an experience equally as harrowing as the one found in the original ""Friday the 13th"".

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: Paramount doesn't appear to have remastered the 1.85:1 widescreen presentation that much for this film. The prologue in particular shows its age and a vast amount of grain. That graininess also reappears at sporadic intervals during the film, serving to completely agitate viewers, especially when one considers that the colors were naturalistic and outdoor locations were well lit. Sadly, this flawed presentation is still a minute step up from any videocassette version I've ever seen. If any horror movie deserved a remaster, it would certainly be this one. On the plus side, the accompanying 2.0 mono track is relatively free of hiss and pops, unlike the track used for the original film. There's fair separation and clean dialogue with only occasional moments of interference. A French mono track is also available for the film as well as English subtitles which are easy to read and have been placed within the frame of the movie. The front cover features a bleak but faithful representation of the old video release cover. The back cover shows no thought or imagination whatsoever on Paramount's part. The one sheet insert that arrives inside of this case features the same lack of ingenuity, but at least it delivers the fourteen chapter stops for this ninety minute film. The disc itself is a silver top with the name of the movie, the Paramount logo and other small tidbits painted on its surface. As with the original ""Friday"" film, the only special feature is the original theatrical trailer (2:10). The trailer has a lot in common with the movie itself. Not just because it previews the film, but because it's a direct sequel to the original theatrical trailer. This trailer picks up where the first one left off. It may be grainy and may only arrive in a 1.33:1 full screen format, but it's still an enjoyable piece of movie history. However, it does make returning cast member Adrienne King's role appear more grand than it really is.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Paramount has never been known for plying their releases with additional footage, let alone hiding anything on the disc. You're more likely to survive a night fending off Jason Voorhees than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Almost all of the female counselors in this movie appear, at least momentarily, in their bathing suits. However, there's more entertainment in this category than mere swimming attire...although Ginny (Amy Steel) looks outstanding in her yellow bikini. As if the bikini weren't enough, Ginny also gives viewers a brief glimpse of her white lace bra when she changes her shirt the first night at camp. In another early instance, viewers have a lovely shot of Sandra's (Marta Kober) bouncing breasts as she and Jeff (Bill Randolph) run towards a pay phone. The camera also makes sure it gets a couple of delicious close-ups of Terry's (Kirsten Baker) behind as she walks through the woods...and gets nipped by Scott's (Russell Todd) slingshot. Later in the film, Baker bares every inch of her sumptuous body when she goes for a late night skinny dip in the lake. The luscious Vicki (Lauren-Marie Taylor) spends some time showcasing her beautiful buns in a pair of panties, and for those lucky viewers who have a zoom button, she also bares her bush while changing into those panties. Adrienne King also has the opportunity to see a ""cute"" pussy, during the opening moments of this film, however it's of the feline variety (hence no asterisks to expose a profanity).

THE GORE REPORT: One of the counselors has his throat slit while hanging from a booby trap and another takes a machete directly into his forehead. There's also a pair of young lovers who are speared through their abdomens in bed. Later, that blood-soaked bed serves as a small gore highlight, however none of these scenes features the bloodshed they should. Rather, the goriest moments of this film come at the beginning during the flashback sequences to part one.

SAY AGAIN: ""These kids smoke better dope than I do."" - Paul Holt (John Furey), head of the new camp.

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. While it's more economical to buy Paramount's collectible boxed set, which features some admittedly intriguing extras as well as the original eight films, the box is still not up to the standards DVD afficionados expect. Therefore, the individual discs are still the preferred method of acquiring the films until true special editions are promulgated.

243195,2,6300214192,"Friday The 13th II is simultaniously a step up as well as a step down from the original.  This entry seems to be better produced yet at the same time much stupider and more pointless.

After the original film's killer was his/herself slain, the sole survivor went home and lived happily ever after...at least until she is killed herself, presumably by Jason, who was believed to be dead.  Jason then donns a burlap bag over his head and begins dispatching teens left and right.  Set 5 years after the original, another batch of sex-crazed teens try to reopen Camp Crystal Lake.  The same old man from episode 1 returns to warn this batch of teens as well, but is killed for no good reason, soon after.  Jason, as I said earlier mows through the teens like a lawn mower, using his trade mark machete on occaision.  Smart girl Ginny uses psychology to slow Jason and then apparently kills him.  Jason survived however, and attacks her and her boy toy in the end, reminiscent of the original's end.

Friday The 13th II is not original at all, contains no suspense and is largely a waste of time.  Fans of seeing people brutally murdered should be happy with this film though.

I suppose I should mention that this group of kids is slightly smarter than the last batch (and I like them a slight bit more).

I awarded this film with 2 stars largely because it is miles ahead of the 3 following entries.",1110153600,,1397,4.5

243197,4,6300214192,"FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 opens with the death of Alice (Adrienne King), the sole-survivor / slayer of psycho-mum from the original. She is trying to get over the trauma of two months earlier. Instead, Alice finds an old acquaintence (well, at least a part thereof) in her fridge, and is terminated via ice-pick! Yep, Jason lives on! It seems he didn't take too kindly to his mama's departure. Now, fast-forward 5 years and we have a whole new slew of numbskulls, getting ready to open their own new camp on Crystal Lake, right next door to the old one! Of course, Jason's all grown up now and gone feral, living on wildlife while waiting for his nitwit human prey to arrive. When they do show up, we find that Ginny (Amy Steel) is the only one among them with a brain in her skull. She seems to sense early on that she's being watched, and even believes the campfire tales of Jason and his mum. The others are just so much machete fodder! One by one (w/ the exception of the amorous pair who are shish-kabobbed together) these wacky kids are done away with in grizzly fashion. I love the ending of this movie and wish it had all ended there, but alas, the sequels keep coming! Enjoy this healthy dose of ghoulish goulash...",1107475200,3,1221,4.431111111111111

  This is the sequel to Friday the 13th Part1. And it is a pretty good sequel. It had some cool graphic deaths. But Jason is not wearing a hockey mask in this one. He wears like a bag, a brown bag with one hole in it. So he can see.  I Thought the 1st one was better because it was more entertaining then this one was. This 1-disc dvd has no real features.

243199,5,6300214192,"In 1980, Sean S. Cunningham's, ""Friday The 13th"" was a massive hit at box-office records. The film was widely praised for its horrifying make-up effects, created by the infamous Tom Savini. But fans craved for more, and they meant to have more.

  In 1981, director Steve Miner gave the fans more with, ""Friday The 13th Part 2"". The film starts off in August of 1980, just two months after the massacre Mrs. Voorhees brought to Camp Crystal Lake that June of 1980. Alice (again played by Adrienne King) has been struggling with the horrifying memories of that brutal massacre that occurred two months ago. She awakes from the terrifying dreams and realizes that she is safe at home. Alice is living on her own, trying to piece her life back together. After a brief phone-conversation with her mother, Alice goes off to take a shower. She finishes her shower, only to hear a noise coming from her kitchen. She goes into the kitchen and grabs an ice pick from the counter. She heads over to the kitchen window, where a cat jumps in. She puts a teakettle on the stove and heads over to the fridge to get the cat some milk. Instead of grabbing the milk, Alice screams in horror when she finds Mrs. Voorhees' head in her fridge. Behind her, is a full-grown...Jason Voorhees (played by Warrington Gillette). He grabs Alice and stabs her in the temple with the ice pick.

  Five years pass after Alice's demise. Paul Holt (played by John Fury) has opened a summer camp, just next to Camp Crystal Lake. He has hired a large batch of counselors, including Jeff (played by Bill Randolph), Sandra (played by Marta Kober), Ted (played by Stuart Charno), Mark (played by the late Tom McBride), Scott (played by Russell Todd), Vicky (played by Lauren-Marie Taylor), Terri (played by Kirsten Baker), and Ginny Fields (played by Amy Steel), Paul's girlfriend and assistant head counselor.

  Everyone arrives safely, but Ginny arrives a little late, due to her car not being in the best of shape. That night, Paul has a little fun with everybody when he reveals the legend of Jason Voorhees, and reveals what happened at Camp Crystal Lake five years ago, where Ted comes out dressed like a dead Viking. That's when Paul informs everyone that Jason is supposedly dead, Mrs. Voorhees was killed by Alice, and Camp Crystal Lake is off limits. The next day, while jogging, Terri's little dog, Muffin, meets Jason, where later that day, Jeff and Sandra go off into Camp Crystal Lake and find a supposed mangled dog. Before they even have the chance to really figure out what it is they're looking at, they are snagged by a cop. The cop has a few words with Paul and then goes on his way, but only to find Jason running around Camp Crystal Lake. The cop chases him deep into the camp and finds a broken-down cabin. He enters the cabin and enters the far-back side of the cabin. What he sees is shocking, but before he can make more comments on what he is seeing, Jason kills him off.

  That night, while Ginny, Paul, and the rest of the counselors go off to party, Scott, Terri, Vicky, Jeff, Sandra, & Mark stay behind to watch the camp. During their watch out, Terri goes for a little skinny dip. Scott jokes around by grabbing Terri's clothes, but he gets caught in a rope trap. As Terri goes to get a knife to cut the rope, Scott is then killed off, followed by Terri. Vicky and Mark make plans to sleep with each other, so Vicky goes off to grab a few things, where Mark is left by himself, where he is then killed. After Mark is killed, Jason kills both Jeff and Sandra through double impaling.
  Vicky returns and searches the whole main cabin for Mark. She enters Jeff and Sandra's room and finds the two of them dead, where she finds Jason, wearing a burlap sac over his head. She does not have chance to run, for she is killed off.

  Paul and Ginny return to find Jason waiting for them. Paul is knocked unconscious, while Ginny battles Jason by herself. She runs into the cabin where the cop was last seen and finds what the cop had found: Mrs. Voorhees' gray sweater and Mrs. Voorhees' rotting head. Ginny grabs the sweater, puts it on, and acts out as Mrs. Voorhees, but Jason knows better. Soon, Paul enters, where Ginny and Paul seemingly kill Jason. As they head back to Ginny's cabin, they find Muffin, Terri's dog, safe and sound. As Ginny goes to pick up Muffin, Jason comes busting through the window, grabbing Ginny. Ginny awakes the next morning, and finds that they paramedics are taking her to the hospital, where she'll be safe.

  Now, I do remember telling you that camping is out of the question. So, put away your camping gear. But while you are waiting, watch Friday The 13th Part 2 if you enjoyed the first.",1106524800,,4717,4.540094339622642
243200,5,6300214192,"Starting 2 months after the events of the original Friday the 13th, the day when Mrs. Voorhees went on her killing spree, Jason finds Alice, the only survivor of the murders, and kills her.  That completes one of two things for Jason: now that he's killed the beheader of his mama, he can move on to killing all of the other camp counselors he comes across.  So, he returns to Camp Crystal Lake, where the teens (and the crazy yet smart hermit Ralph) are all killed until the head of the camp and the second survivor girl are left.  The ending is a lot better, so I won't spoil it.

Before I started watching the Friday the 13th films, I thought that they all had some hockey masked killing machine in them, until I saw this one.  Because Jason actually kills an idiot teen who he takes the hockey mask from (in Part 3) he has to put a pillow cover, or whatever the director created, over his head.  It actually makes him look like the hillbilly/killed mama avenger that he should be.  I would highly recommend this one if you want more action than the first.  Enjoy, to whatever extent you can handle!",1104796800,,1102,4.367647058823529
243201,4,6300214192,This movie is the only good sequel in the Friday The 13th Series! I think it's a very good movie and I would have liked it better if the main character Alice played by Adrienne King would have survived the film! She is way too good of actress to just die during the first 15 minutes! This film and Halloween 2 were released around the same time and I like the Halloween series better than the Friday The 13th series. I think this is a good one you should buy it.,1104537600,,462,4.087912087912088
243202,2,6300214192,"You don't have to watch these films in order, but I suppose it helps.

The story so far: little Jason, the deformed child supposedly drowned many years ago, came back from the dead to avenge the killing of his psychopathic mother, who was bumping off the kinds of dozy teens who made love whilst her son, entrusted into their care, was drowning.

So now, several years later, Camp Crystal Lake is open once again, and a load of teenaged councillors are moving in to take drugs, have sex and do all the other kinds of things that'd make you delighted to entrust your kids into their care.  The survivor from the first film has been murdered, so a new heroine must outwit Jason.

Quite frankly, a good opening sequence and a spooky climax involving Jason's shrine to his mother can't excuse the eighty minutes of tedium in between.  The special effects are worse than in the first film, the teenagers are irritating, and the occasional musings about the mysterious Jason are ruined by pathetic attempts at humour.

Worth watching if you're a fan of the series, if only to see the film which introduced the grown-up Jason.",1100736000,,1119,4.654822335025381
243213,4,6300214192,"The ""Friday the 13th"" series has become a cult favorite since the release of the original installment in 1980.  Ten successful sequels have been released since.  This series has given new meaning to the horror genre.  Its frequent bloodshed keeps the films interesting.  Though they are B-rated films, all are highly entertaining.  This has forced some audiences to become more alert when camping in the woods.  Camp Crystal Lake has become a very famous fictional landmark in horror films.

""Friday the 13th: Part 2"", released in 1981, is no exception.  Unlike the predecer that desplicts Mrs. Voorhees's murderous rage, this introduces Jason Voorhees to the spotlight.  Since this film, he has become a horror film favorite to many fans.  He doesn't start wearing the infamous hockey mask until Part 3.  He wears a cloth over his disfigued face in Part 2.  As he slashes young campers one on one, the story continues to build in suspense and adrenaline.  Regardless multiple viewings, the storyline remains exciting.  Though occasionally the plot contains some unrelated scenes, their wit continues to entertain.  Through the blood, the gore, the sex, the mischief, the camp, and the chases, its audiences screams continue.  Though the acting is average, their unique presence and the personalities make up for that while staying true to the horror theme.

""Friday the 13th: Part 2"" is sure to please many horror film fans.  Those curious about this film should watch the original installment first.  Otherwise the storyline will be confusing.  Those who like these should proceed to the others in order.",1098144000,,1606,5.127413127413128

The first deliberately ended on a wide-open note (not as common in 1980 as it is today, and not in the slightest contrived but the pivotal point for the whole movie and perhaps the whole series) and without the second chapter the first would have been woefully incomplete.

  I think ""Part 2"" fully equals or possibly exceeds its predecessor.  Like ""Part 1"", it's shot in a somewhat 'rough' manner, with simple camerawork and a minimum of flash, similar to the styles for the first ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Basket Case"", though not nearly As rough.  It's a technique that's worked far better in a number of horror films than in most genres, because it doesn't look like someone's meticulously filming a motion picture, it looks as though events are being captured on film as they happen, giving the movie (when it's done right) a creepy, unsettling atmosphere.

  It's got one of the most likable casts of characters in The ""Friday"" line (admittedly a problem in some of the other entries), with even the couple of characters who look like they're going to be total wastes becoming much more bearable as the movie progresses and you get to know them, with my personal favorite all along being the Kirsten Baker character (Teri). And Jason, of course.  Actually, this is one of the most essential chapters in the series in establishing Jason as not just atop-tier horror monster, but a top-tier 'sympathetic' horror monster in the vein of the Frankenstein Monster, as opposed to Freddy Krueger, who's a top-tier 'Pure Evil' horror monster.  It's been opined that Jason isn't truly evil because he acts on instinct alone like the shark in Jaws, or a force of nature like a hurricane - with no actual will and hence no ill will.  I agree with part of that but not all - I submit that Jason acts on instinct AND emotion but without reasoning, rationality, or any of the 'intellecetual' thought processes, aside from occasional glimmers at most.  One can see that in this film, especially when it's rewatched after some of the later entries.  You see things in the early films in new ways, and sometimes from very  disturbing new angles after you have the benefit of hindsight from seeing all the movies.  Very surprisingly, you can also sometimes see things from slightly brighter possible angles too, in addition to darker interpretations.

  Both by itself and in conjunction with the other entries, ""Part 2"" is particularly disturbing in some of the things it doesn't come right out and say, but which have unsettling implications for possible untold parts of Jason Voorhees's origins.  There are some things that are very open to interpretation in places (some in more than one mutually-contradictory direction).  To say any more would be to risk giving away possible spoilers.

  In less abstract terms to this movie's many high points - excellent pacing, high intensity, some genuine humor (as opposed to failed attempts at humor in some similar horror movies), some truly ferocious moments, and an absolutely awesome midight lakeside scene with Baker (which was all the more enjoyable because it didn't come until after one had time to get to know her character, so by that point I was thoroughly smitten with her).  Also, Baker's character has an adorable little puppy she carries along with her through much of the movie.  A little 'cute animal' touch here and there to occasionally break the tension usually doesn't hurt; plus it makes me like the character even more because I have a soft spot for girls who love animals.  Besides, she's so frikkin' Sexy (Kirsten, not the dog!!)

  All this and one of the best, most high-charged endings in the ""Friday"" series - this isn't just a must-see, this is a must-have.",1096502400,95,3873,4.815431164901664
243216,3,6300214192,"It didn't take long for Paramount to get right back into production on the sequel to their successful invention that is Friday The 13th. There are reasons why this movie was more popular than the original, but I must say overall I was disappointed.

 The plot puts us in the home of Alice, our female survivor from part 1, and within three minutes she's killed by Jason. We then fast forward to five years later where (and tell me if this sounds familiar) Paul Holt (replacing Bill Christy) has decided to ignore the stories of it having a curse and rebuild Camp Crystal Lake anyway. This time, however, Jason is the killer instead of his mother and things get a little more gruesome. The plot still breaks us down to the death of every counselor except for one, this time its Ginny instead of Alice, and a final showdown.

 Okay, I know this is the film that Jason is introduced and although he's got a lawn bag for a mask that many people found this installment to be one of their favorites, why? The plot is recycled at best, changing Jason's mother with Jason, and a sad excuse for an ending. Ginny does show some courage, however I must admit that she's not really dealing with Jason until the end (she's not even at the camp until then)! I also felt, probably like others, that Jason was tricked in a way that was just a little too convenient and childish than I think even he is capable of (especially because he plays a pretty good cat and mouse game with Ginny just minutes earlier). I also didn't like the blow Jason endures to finish him off, it makes the ending incredibly predictable. What I did like about this film was the introduction of Jason, who is much more intimidating than his mother (however the lack of Betsy Palmer was missed). I also liked the deaths, which endured some upgrades but unfortunately weren't as gory as the first movie (less splatter). The movie also starts its famous ""naked girl swimming for no reason at midnight"" sequences that will follow in almost every movie from now on.

 The DVD, again, isn't much compared to the ones of today, but I do feel it is just perfectly appropriate with what I wanted. I got the movie with cleaned up video and crisp sound. I know it sucks that we only got 2.0, but see my previous review as to my feelings on that. I liked the trailer, it was fun to see how they were back then and it was all in all a good package. As far as hoping for an ""uncut"" version, I didn't see any obvious cuts and I'm not sure that would even interest me too much (ok, it would, but it's not going to happen!).

 This movie isn't what many fans have made it out to be. Do I own it? Sure. It's still another ""classic"" because it introduces Jason and works well with natural progression. For the non-collecting, non-Jason fans, however, you may want to skip this one or watch a friend's copy first and make your own choice. If you're not an avid fan, this'll also be one of the reasons you consider the boxed set rather than buying them one by one (however read each of my reviews on the series first!).",1091664000,,3057,4.379188712522046
243217,4,6300214192,"Steve Miner brings us the first sequal in what would eventually be many. Part 2 introduces Jason, who would later become an icon in the horror genre. After avenging the death of his mother, Jason stalks his way into a nearby counselor training camp. With better lighting then the original movie, it ends up a better overall film then the previous (unless you just can't stand Jason). While the majority of the film focuses on Jason's murder spree, it also answers some questions that most people never pay much heed to. It shows the hut Jason lives in (that he apparently built himself), how he survived in the woods, and why he kills people (at this point to appease his dead mother, possibly resurrect her). Unlike the previous movie, this one was more about bloody death scenes then the mystery of who the murderer is. At this point in the series, Jason doesn't seem like the completely unstopable killer he is later on. He even has a lot of trouble wrestling with one of the characters towards the end of the video.

Also note, that if you are tired of watching perfect young teens gettings slaughtered by now, you should turn away from the series. Those of us that just like to see blood and guts (with the occasional set of boobs) will continue to enjoy this series as it continues on.",1091145600,,1291,4.564655172413793
243218,2,6300214192,"""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is well known by horror/slasher fans to be considered the second best of the series. And I don't know why. I'd say part 6 is. But im not here to talk about part 6, so I guess I'll have to review this. Part 2 begins by killing off probably the nicest ""last girl"" of the series, Alice. On my first viewing, I was dissapointed already. However, Alice is replaced by yet another satisfying ""last gir"", the sassy and smart Ginny; but she still didn't save the rest of the film from being a dissapointment. The whole movie just seems to be missing something; I have no idea WHAT tho. The rather murky atmosphere also made it a tad depressing. And a poor little dog is killed! About the only thing I liked about the whole thing was Ginny. She, and the first appearence of Jason may have helped some in making this installment so popular...",1089417600,,858,4.36875

243245,5,6300214192,"Many people don't really count this as a good Jason movie, but I find it to be the best one.
He may not have the ""famous"" hockey mask. No, instead he uses a pillow sack (or something like that), he doesn't get the mask until the next chapter (part 3). This film is quite similar to the first, but it isn't as boring and slow. It gets pretty straight to the deaths. The film starts us off with the girl who survived from the first film, and we see Jason getting her own back on her, for killing his mum. I think that can be quite a creepy scene, when we see Jason's mom's head in the fridge. Then the film heads five years later, and a set of new kids are heading to Crystal lake. Once the first teenage dies, it just starts to get freaky and scary.
The film probably does have a bit more nudity in it, but still now much. As we do get on the first film, there is quite a chilling chase sequence within the last 10 minutes of the film, with Jason chasing a teenage girl (of course). The chase stretches out quite a bit and can become quite scary. Until we come to the end, and we get quite a jumpy, freaky twist at the end., like we do in the first film's end.
So, in my opinion, the best Jason film. Other good Jason titles are:
Part 4
Part 6
Part 8",1087776000,,1249,3.9800796812749004
243246,2,6300214192,"""Friday the 13th part 2"", while not as well thought out as the first, is more enjoyable than its predecessor, despite its fluffiness. It actually takes place in 1985, tho it was made only a year after the original, at a camp *near* Camp Crystal Lake. There are AlOT more counslers this time, but most of them remain namless, and we don't really hear them say anything. Only about 9 of them, or something, get killed when left behind at camp, while the others go to a bar. The only two things that bothered me about this installment was that it felt too short. Actually, it IS the shortest 'Friday film in running time. The other problem being the death of Alice. I really liked her charector! And it wasn't even necessary to the rest of the film that she dies...Did anyone else feel sorry for her?!?!?! BUT, Ginny, the new heroine is also great.

243247,1,6300214192,"Without suspense, without real scares, and without any of the tense atmosphere that gave at least something of value to FRIDAY THE 13TH, this sequel---the first in which Jason appears, and without his trademark hockey mask---is pretty inferior to an already mediocre horror film. Without even any hint of the mystery element that the original at least tried for, what's left? Just a worthless slash-o-rama---even more worthless since a lot of the original gore effects had to be cut in order to avoid an X rating. A FRIDAY THE 13TH without a whole lotta gore?

Cast:  Amy Steel, John Furey, Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer.
Running Time:  87 minutes.
Rated R for violence, gore, and language.
While most horror sequels are laughable compared to the successful originals, this second installment in the endless series is just as good, if not better than the original.  Director Steve Miner creates a film that is actually very terrifying, with many sudden jumps, jolts, pitchforks flying through walls, and maniac hands crashing unexpectedly through windows.  The basic premise of the film is about the resurrected thought-to-be-dead Jason Voorhees, who returns to Crystal Lake camp to avenge his drowning fifteen years before.
Amy Steel is fair in the lead heroine role, running around frantically as he finds more counselor dead bodies spread throughout the camp.  ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is no horror classic and it has lost some of its luster in its over 20 years of age, but fans of the series or those who want a good scare should give this sequel (the best one in the series) a chance.

This second film is much like the first, a jump out of your seat scarefest. The sack that Jason wears over his head thru out the film is inspired by the 70's movie - ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" (the film, based on a true incident in Texarcana, Arkansas, had a hooded serial killer running amok in a small town). Ever wonder what happened to the cast of any of the ""Friday"" films? You're probablly thinking that these films are usually career poison (like I did), but you would be wrong.

Flashbacks chronicle Jason's behind-the-scenes activities in the first film (perhaps explaining how his mother was able to throw the dead bodies of muscular youths through windows with such apparent ease).

Maybe when he kills people it's becasue their less ugly than he is. If Jason didn't have a sack or his hockey mask over his head the people would die just by looking at him. I have a question though. Why can he come back from the dead but his mom can't. You'd think it would run in the family. And why is Jason all grown up now. This movie was basically the first one except Jason was in it. Same plot almost same characters. The nudity in these movies is just unnecissary. Friday the 13th movies about the most boring movies i've ever watched.

I would never go to a summer camp of any kind after seeing these movies. It is a great series, but I strongly feel that they should have just made the Friday movies into a thrilogy and stopped after the third film. All of the films form the forth one on was not the same storylines as the original three, the rest of the films storylines go in all kinds of different directions.

The story is pretty simple. A bunch of councellors are training for the fateful day when they'll be watching children. And basically that's what goes on for the entire movie, only as it progresses you get more perversion and kills.
There's plenty of horror in this, with Jason running around, you don't know where he'll turn up or when he'll strike. The final chase can get pretty intense as well.
The characters, well, they're all pretty horny and that's pretty much what you could say for all of them except the main heroine, who worries about Jason, Jason, who kills, and the cop, who tries to keep people out of the Crystal Lake campground (these councellors are actually a mile or so away).
The kills are all done with various sharp implements, but they're done at just about the right time. Knives, barbed wire, machetes, pick things, its a buffet of stabbity stabs.
As for acting, it seems decent enough. The main characters do their job pretty good, and Jason was really awesome. Too bad we don't see him act this way ever again. The woods were also a particularly scary place to have this film, even in the daylight it had a creepy tone to it.

I can definately understand why there are so many negative reviews of the film, and most of the things they are saying are probably true. But you know what I like this film in spite... strike that... because of all that [garbage]. Obviously the film's plot is a retread of the first film, but hey, I've seen that plot in 498 other horror films too, thats just how horror films work. A hero being chased by an invincible killer and how he/she overcomes the impossible... and lots of other people get killed in the process.
That being said, I love this film. Its just awesome. All the kill scenes are just spectacular. My favorie has to be the guy in the wheelchair, that is friggin' classic. Jason is an equal oppertunity killer! The acting is atrocious (and so is my spelling) but I wouldn't have it any other way. I don't want to like these people. I don't want them to say meaningful things that I can relate to. The less I know about them the better, because I know in about five minutes there's going to be a machete in their head. So let them spit out one-liners and cliches they'll be gone soon enough.
So if you can get passed the flawed script and the bad acting (which in my opinion are both part of what a good horror film is) you can get into the special effects and direction by one of my favorite directors, Steve Miner, in his directing debut. The effects in this film are superb: ghastly, bloody, revolting, classic. The direction is above par for a splatter filck especially for a newcomer.
Finally the movie definately still packs a scary punch. I don't care how cool you think you are, or how stupid you think horror movies are, Jason is a mean MF and if you aren't afraid of him, he'll see to it you don't live to say ""that looked so fake""!",1058054400,,1894,4.338028169014085

The movie takes place 5 years after the first one,a bunch of teenagers are at a local counselor training camp on the same lake as Camp Crystal Lake. They all think that Jason is just a legend,what a big mistake as all the counselors are again killed off one by one. While Friday The 13th 2 isn't as great as the first one,it's good in it's own way. One of the problems with this one is the stupid outfit that Jason wore,it's something hillbilly like. The deaths scenes are cool but not a gory as the first one or some of the sequels.

Five years later, a camp leader named Paul (John Furey) and girlfriend Ginny (Amy Steel) has opened up a counselor training center facility just near ""Camp Blood"" as some folks of the town near the lake call it. However rumors has spread that the legendary mongoloid child Jason Voorhees (Warrington Gillette) is still alive for he didn't drowned by lives as a hermit in the woods to avenge his mother's death but soon people at the facility start disappearing one by bloody one as only two people must try to see if Jason Voorhees is behind these killings.

Exciting and well paced sequel to a horror masterpiece that made the big slasher craze of the 80's! A year after the original movie made alot of money at the box-office, Paramount decided to make a sequel and of course a franchise thus it became a reality. Betsy Palmer does a nice cameo as Mrs. Voorhees even though it's just a mirage in Jason's mind, here Jason becomes the villain after his mother was the original villain in the first movie. This one has him wearing a Burlap sack on his head with one eye which was a year before he donned the infamous hockey mask that made him so iconic. The body count is higher this time then the last one with some cool gory murders like a machete to the face of a wheel-chaired person and a Icepick through the skull for instance as the film offers some good jump scares and one bizarre ending.

This DVD may not have the uncut version but the film is nicely remastered with great picture and sound with cool extras like ""Inside Crystal Memories"" interview, ""Friday's Legacy Horror Conventions"" featurette, Lost Tales from Camp Blood part 2 short film, Jason Forever featurette and Trailer.",1048550400,,1930,4.656891495601173

243345,5,6300214192,"This actually a very scary, funny, and poorly made movie all at the same time, but manages to be good. We are introduced once again to Jason, but this time he's all grown up now, and can do things for himself. The costume for Jason in this film, is actually creepy. To get scareed in this film you must take it seriously, and not make fun of it (that's what Scream is for) and enjoy this as a horror movie. This series is always being bashed by critics, but the fact of the matter is, Friday the 13th does have a plot and tells a long complex story, it's about a boy who drowned, but comes back to life to take revenge for his dead mother. He was a mongoloid and wasn't liked by the counselers or the kids, and was a mager hydrophobic. The only friend he had in the world was his mother, and when he saw her die, he went insane, and decided that if anyone ventured into the woods again, he'd kill them. This series is terribly misunderstood, and should be taken seriously, regardless how poorly they were made. Paramount better start releasing these movies un-cut, because idf they haven't relized, there are more people that like it than those who dont. It takes a certain breed of woman to face off against Jason Voorhees - delicate and sensitive, slightly on the prim side but resourceful when it comes to a life-or-death battle. Women should praise these films, because it is the women who are the heros and not the men. I don't think anybody really set out to change the world with these movies, nobody will ever be accused of trying to make a social statement or great art. What these films are is entertainment, and about what the audience wants. Can't wait for Freddy v.s. Jason, Jason is going to win!",1043193600,,1710,4.3974763406940065

243348,3,6300214192,"The second in what would become one of the most milked movie franchises ever (there are ten incuding the recent Jason X), Friday The 13th Part 2 isn't nearly as bad as you might expect.  It's obviously noticeable for introducing us to Jason for the first time, although he doesn't get to don his hockey mask until Act 3, here wearing a cloth with an eyehole which is actually quite creepy.  Set five years after the original yet made only a year after, this has a group of kids up on Camp Crystal partying and doing things they shouldn't be.
What's most fun about this is watching all those clichs laid out in front of us.  There's the post-coital killing, the girl who's punished for going skinny-dipping and the old man whose prophesies of doom turn back on him.  If you watch this after watching Scream, it's impossible not to laugh at the now famous score and several scenes which is parodied from the film, most notable the scene with Ginny in the car.  The killings are all pretty gruesome, with some very dark humuor being injected into several impressive set-ups such as the boy in the wheelchair rolling backwards down the steps of a cabin after being murdered with an axe.  Of course, after dispatching with the original only survivor in the opening sequence, all you've got left are a group of blandly attractive undeveloped characters that you can't really care about.  Still, it's not without an element of fun that you watch the voyeuristic camera movements follow the sexy girl out to the car accompanied by corny music.
Unusually, the female protagonist Ginny outwits the killer rather than just outrunning him or waiting for help.  Obviously the explanation for Jason's murders are lifted straight from Psycho, but the scene where she wears his mother's jumper to try and convince him that she's her should be given some credit at least.  Plus there's an inconclusive ending which leaves it open for Part 3.  I have to admit to never watching any of the sequels, and from what you hear they're all pretty bad, but this one is actually pretty good and worth at least an hour or so of your time.",1036713600,,2110,4.647849462365591

It's not all that different from the first one(actually, none of them are), but it's good for junkfood entertainment. This is pre-juggernaut Jason, so it's interesting to see him as a scrawny guy in overalls. He makes a special trip to the city to kill Alice from the first film. He wouldn't do this again till part 8. He stumbles, gets chainsawed, gets kicked in the crotch, wrestles with the boyfriend, makes mistakes in judgment. Pretty neat. Some of these reviewers tend to complain about the sack Jason wears. What's the big deal? If you were some deformed orphan surviving in the woods, it's very logical that a sack is the best mask you'll find. This is the one that introduces us to the guy who would become the Frankenstein of the 80s along with the Dracula(Freddy Krueger) of the 80s.",1036540800,,947,4.479768786127168

This time he stalks Ginny(Amy Steel) five years later, and more counselers at Camp Crystal Lake who plan to reopen it.

While there are a few half decent moments, the rest of Friday the 13th Part 2 falls flat on its face.

Two teenagers are off to start up a camp, very near to Crystal Lake. Yes, for us horror buffs, we know very well old Camp Blood wasn't the dead-on setting for this sequel, and wouldn't be used until Part VI (renamed Camp Forrest Green).

This chapter is the introduction of a character who was killed as a little boy, drowned at summer camp in 1957.  His mother, who was the killer in part 1, was beheaded and that somehow brought the boy back to life.  Five years before part 2 we see him still as that 11 year old boy coming out of the lake, covered in sea weeds.  But in part 2, he seems to have grown in size and age.  There is also, in part 2, the return of the ""town crazy""-who seems to be nothing less than a prophet.  All the other townspeople dismiss Jason as a legend, but they are still scared of the camp reopening.  His invulnerability is the true key to how Jason stayed 11 years old for 26 years (1957-1985).  -Since parts 2, 3, and 4 take place back to back, and part 2 happens five years after part 1, the whole thing takes place the year part 4 came out in the theaters.-  He begins to age again when he is reborn at the end of part 1, and like a newborn is easily wounded.

This one is right up there with the original.  It follows the same formula as Friday the 13th; 45m. to meet everyone, 20m. to kill everyone, then another 20m. for the heroine to battle with the revealed killer.  If you thought the first one worked, you'll think this one does too.
This one does have a few things going for it that the first one doesn't.  Steve Miner does an excellent job with the murder set pieces, blowing away anything in the first film.  The ending duel is much more elaborate and the heroine is much smarter this time around.  ""You've done your job well, and mommy is pleased.""
The burlap sack rules the school.  It does a better job of making you wonder just what is under there. And by the way can we get a consensus as to just when this movie takes place?  Is it five years or five months after the first one?
The DVD has a nice enough transfer considering that Paramount probably stores these movies in dank, wet cellar and hopes that they'll get ruined by flood damage.  Again, this is the cut version.  No alternate endings(Mrs. Voorhees opens her eyes!)Why?  I don't even ask that you put the restored scenes in the movie, just use them as extras.  Please.  I'll buy you an ice cream.

243456,5,6300214192,"After the great Friday the 13th we have the even greater Friday the 13th part 2. This movie uses humour as well as teen terror. The comedical element makes it unique from the others in the series. After the events at Camp Crystal Lake, a training camp on the same route has opened and counsellors arrive for a summer of fun!
So who are these counsellors - who have given up their summer to play victim to Jason Vorhees?
Ginny - a girl next door type who in some ways is very similar to Alice in Friday the 13th but has more girl power. Alice may have defeated Mrs Vorhees but can Ginny take on Jason?
Paul - the mastermind who opened the training center ignoring any rumours linked to Camp Crystal. He and Ginny look foward to a summer of passion.....is that what they'll get?
Sandra and Jeffrey - the perfect couple. Camp is a chance to be together and to investigate Camp Crystal. Will they disturb the peaceful Camp and awaken the evil? Should they have listened to Crazy Ralph?
Terri, Mark, Vicky and Ted - more camp counsellors who have entered the biggest death trap. Will camp be the greatest experience? or will they be saying their prayers before sundown?
Alice - she defeated Mrs Vorhees and was the only survivor at Camp Blood - will she be so lucky this time round?
Friday the 13th part 2 has become my favourite Friday film. The humour element made this movie a cracker!

Before she a can scream, a ice pick goes through her temple (ouch!).  It's obivious who the killer is, none other than Jason Voorhees, Mrs. Voorhees' imfamous son.  Meanwhile, at Camp Crystal Lake, new management re-opens the park, despite all the warnings and curses told about the place.  Little do the dim witted, sexually active teens know is that Jason has return to finish some business.  Jason wears a white sheet/bag over his head, despite his ugly, deformed head (which, for some reason, remind's me of ""ork"" from the film ""The Goonies""), rather than his imfamous Hockey mask, which he picks up in Part 3.  Friday the 13th pt. 2 is really, in a way, a ""remake""/""semi-sequel"" (if any horror fans have seen ""Evil Dead II: Dead before Dawn"", they know what I'm talking about) in my opinion.  While it was released only a year after the first film, it lacked box office success the first film gained.  It wasn't till Jason picked up his Hockey Mask at a local Sports Mart (and started his long despute with Corey Feldman) till the series picked up it's popularity.",1013644800,,1628,4.74113475177305
243459,4,6300214192,"Knock a star off this review if you don't like slasher movies.  It's not a great movie per se, but for what it is, a sequel to a highly successful low-budget horror flick, it's not bad.  This appeared less than a full year after the original Friday, and in some ways it certainly seems rushed.
The film has a brisker pace than the original.  It also clocks in at only 87 minutes, including an extended pre-title credits sequence that includes plenty of flashback to Part I.  Again, it feels a bit rushed, but to be honest, at least things get moving down to the nitty-gritty of the stalking pretty quickly.
This is the film that really introduces us to Jason Voorhees, the maniacal killer of, oh, about 8 more movies.  Part 2 takes place 5 years after the original slaughter.  A group of counselors are opening up a camp on another part of Crystal Lake, not far from the camp where the murders in the first film took place.  They sit around the campfire and talk about the Jason ""legend"", try to scare each other, and then dismiss it as a legend.  Smart, right?
Well, it doesn't take long for a grown-up Jason to wander his woods and start offing most of the cast.  He wears a sack over his distorted face; it wouldn't be until Part 3 that he would acquire the famous hockey mask.  There are more murders in this installment, and bloodier ones.  Apparently though, this film had to be cut just under 10(!) times in order to avoid an X rating by the MPAA.
Which brings me to the DVD release of this and all of the Friday films for that matter.  What gives?!  Paramount should be well aware of the MASSIVE fan base for these films.  Most die-hards know that there were many cuts to this and all of the Friday films, yet we have yet to see any restoration on video, laserdisc, or DVD in America.  The list price for these DVDs is not cheap, and yet Paramount cannot be bothered doing anything with them, except including one rather cheesy theatrical trailer.
It's quite obvious that all of the murders are cut for gore.  The MPAA really went to work on the slasher genre around this time, yet I've seen much, much worse blood and gore in countless ""action"" films.  (Check Robocop from 1987, and then watch Friday the 13th Part 6 or 7 from around the same years and compare.)
Anyone who reads around the internet knows that there are cut scenes in these films AND that there is a market for uncut, deluxe DVDs for the Friday films.  So would Paramount please do justice to this series that made them so much money?
If you own the videos though, the DVDs are certainly an improvement on sound and picture.  They could still be better.  The transfers are good but not spectacular, and the soundtracks could be much better.
Strong points for this film include my favorite Friday heroine--the resourceful Ginny.  The writers tried to inject a little bit more Jason story into this one, but again, it all seems a bit rushed to cash in on the popularity of the original.  The film has a pretty creepy atmosphere once Jason gets up to his old antics, including hiding under some bedsheets to pop up and surprise a female victim, as well as the (again, cut) double-impalement on the bed.  The ending is creepy as well...what happened to Paul?  Or Jason for that matter?
All in all, Friday fans will probably pick this up just because, but Paramount should really go to work on this series and finally do it right for release.",1013126400,6,3413,4.467741935483871
243460,4,6300214192,"Ahh yes, the beginning of Jason's killing spree. I think part 2 is better than the first, simply because I am a Jason fan, and nobody can compare to him in the Slasher genre. You may notice that later on in the series the whole summer camp atmosphere is lost due to the fact that Camp Blood is closed down (I wonder why?). Well, the first 2 movies take place entirely in this camp environment, which is what makes them great. Jason is ruthless, and this movie is ruthless. Stupid kids get slaughtered one by one in glorious early 80's slasher style. Be prepared for: throat slashings, hangings, hammer in the back of the head, machette in the face, double your pleasure, double your impalement, severed head, axe ripping flesh open, and more. Don't mess with Jason! Although not nearly as gory as part 3, 4, or 9. 2 is still a classic.",1012176000,,835,4.4640522875816995

This gripping film, a follow-up to the original hit, is, in my opinion, just as compelling-packed with just as much shrills and suspense. To those who love watching the sequels that followed, it's likely that they may not like this one. But if that is so, it's also likely that they may have not liked the original, either, for in that particular point of the series a firm narrative still existed and you somehow still took it seriously, despite of how obtuse it frequently seemed, but those were the early eighties for you, and you had to keep that in mind, you had to keep in mind of the genre's techniques back then, a time when slashers were somewhat meretricious, in other words, enjoyable and yet clearly cheesy at the same time. In the decade that we are now in, when I think of this film, I think highly of it, yes, but I just can't picture a group of wild teenagers with earrings pierced all throughout their bodies and chains hanging out from their jeans, really taking it seriously, for it still had purpose, but that's precisely the way it is nowadays: the greater the shape and intellect, the less attraction for the younger ones.
Although there were a number of mistakes made, though such vacuous errors could've easily been prevented, they were still quite minor, and even if they were to draw someone's attention, are good for a laugh and yet not at all affective to the terror that fans of the original would come to expect in this one. It's great entertainment. It's all-good. (For instance, in Crazy Ralph's death scene, he's watching two lovers physically showing their affection to one another, from outside their window, when all of the sudden you observe of a wire going over the tree in which he was standing next to and around his neck; it must have been a pretty short tree, huh?) Ralph, mind you, was a local resident aware of the town's curse, and he really set the mood as one to warn vacationers of the consequences they'll undergo if choosing not to embark from it, which merely deteriorates his self-image to these vacationers who of course never really take him seriously, they may momentarily find themselves swooped into a world of wonder, but are bright enough (or stupid enough) to know better than to listen to some old loony, being the reason the old man's known as...well, ""Crazy Ralph."" I loved him. Why did he have to die? I guess he was the one distinctive factor that would thwart Jason's killing spree. (""I told the others. They didn't believe me. You're all doomed. You're all doomed,"" he tells them.)
Ron Kurz did a fanciful job with the dialogue, especially for one sequence of the film in particular. It's the one where the entire cast of characters (before most of whom did meet their doom) was gathered together around the fire (the rather weak one) in the middle of the night, doing what any other counselor into the spirit of camping would do in such circumstances: roasting goodies while telling long tales of those legendary people feared by many. What I really liked about this piece, what was so clever about it is that, sentient that this being the first film in the series to really introduce Jason as the next stalker more than ready to discharge of such obvious rage and fulfill his vengeance upon these nave interlopers, they have them enlighten you upon such a madman's infamous chronicles before ultimately the characters...well, fell as victims to his bloody rampage themselves. They enlighten you and then get a little inventive as they begin to conjecture as to how his living conditions might be and as to the man that he may have grown to be, which makes matters all but more chilling as it then alters your initial perspective upon his semblance and persona in which he was given prior to this one when he was just a child, and braces you for a whole new one that, as they explicate, grew to be very unpleasant. You begin to get a sense of what you're in for.
Using the most mesmeric and beguiling words, the leading character of the group, the head counselor, Paul, cleverly sucked you right into his tale until ultimately some goofy counselor not yet seen in this scene leaped into the picture dressed in some ape-like Halloween costume, and you develop a sense of what the filmmakers were trying to do. Diminishing the mood, it then was all fun and games and Paul essentially assured the others that regardless of how deep they stroll into the woods, no peculiar-looking individual would wind up face-to-face with them, which of course, as the film deepened, wasn't true at all, as some peculiar-looking individual did, and we all know what happens next...

243463,3,6300214192,"After a pre-credit sequence that nicely severs itself from the previous film's storyline, Friday the 13th Part 2 jumps forward five years to focus on a new group of victims to be opening a ""Counselor Boot Camp"" on the accursed Crystal Lake.  The raw wounds of the previous debacle are still sore points with the locals, who are leery of a possible new 'Camp Blood', and with good reason.  Turns out that Jason Voorhees (whose burlap sack of a mask had 1981 theater audiences giggling and making joking references to David Lynch's then current hit The Elephant Man) did not drown in Crystal Lake like his mother believed, but has been living like an animal in the surrounding woods while waiting for the opportunity to continue enacting his revenge for his mother's murder.  As the advertisements promised, 'the body count continues'!
First time director Steve Miner (Lake Placid, Halloween H20) keeps screenwriter Ron Kurz's ultra-flimsy 'story' moving at a gallop.  Clocking in at an economical 87 minutes, Friday the 13th Part 2 is the shortest film of the series and a fairly entertaining one.  Amy Steel (April Fool's Day, The Powers of Matthew Starr) makes an engaging herione and Stu Charno (Christine) provides, for a change, non-irritating and plot natural comic relief as the camp's merry prankster.  Harry Manfredini's now famous score remains a rollicking rollercoaster ride of a horror movie composition.

Good points:

extremely bizarre ending
best Friday the 13th actress, Amy Steel, as ""Ginny""
return of ""Crazy Ralph""
scarriest death scene: Vikki (when Jason hides under covers)!!
creepiest cat & mouse chase (with Ginny)
Of course this movie was nowhere near perfect.  Not much information is given to the audience & the ending leaves you hanging.  And what's up with the intro?  The scene with Alice was unrealistic & rather pointless.  Jason couldn't possibly know how to track down his mother's killer.
Too much was cut from this movie as well.  In the original script, Mrs Voorhees's eyes were suppose open!  That would have opened up doors for the following sequals (then in Part 3 she would return?) <g>
After part 2, the FRIDAY THE 13th plot goes somewhere else.

He's not the hockey masked maniac he would later become, but he's very frightening as a mentally disturbed freak who roams the woods wearing a sheet over his head.  The climax is a real show down that would later become the highlight of these movies.  This is a classic slasher of the early 80's and the new DVD does it a lot of justice.  Although the old VHS tapes were in much better shape than some of the other movies in the series, Part 2 does look much better on DVD.

243516,2,6300214192,"Friday The 13th was a surprise box office hit in 1980, so a sequel was inevitable. While the original film was a rather decent and raw horror film, this sequel begins what is to be the typical in slasher/horror/Friday The 13th sequels. Most of the rawness and vividness of the first film will never be recaptured, and they become the quintessential hack and slash horror sequels. Beginning with this one. The only thing that makes this sequel different from the original is the introduction of Jason. If you remember, his mother was the killer in the original. As far as slasher films go, this one is pleasing. Nothing new. As expected, there really isn't a story here. Did you expect one?. There's a camp. There's some camp councelors. There's some campers. There's a homicidal killer with a fondness for gardening tools and other sharp instruments. Voila!. You got yourself a sequel!. We get a decent lead performance by Amy Steel as Jenny. She's not great, but she does the part good enough. This film is before Jason gets his infamous hockey mask. If you ask me, Jason's sheet he wears in this film with one eye hole(reminiscent of The Elephant Man) is far more scarier than the hockey mask. That's just me. What do you all think?. We are bombarded with more of the same babes in the woods getting knifed, strangled, sliced & diced. There's even a twofer when Jason gets two campers at once. Any guesses as to what they were doing?. It's sure to please any Friday fan and slasher fan. Other than that, why bother?.",1000339200,,1518,4.646840148698884
243517,2,6300214192,"I have never seen FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 until 1983 and back then, I found the sequel to be scary but I have always found this film to fall flat in some areas.
I bought FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 on VHS along with the original film back in 1989, then bought the DVD edition of this film when released in October 1999.
FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 was the only film in the film series to return participants from its prodecessor.  This sequel returns Adrienne King (Alice who survived Part 1), Walt Gorney (Crazy Ralph from Part 1) and a cameo appearance by Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees from the original slasher film.
FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 I found took too overlong to introduce itself, the film dragged in many areas and I found Jason to be very wimpy in this film, especially around the fight sequences with Ginny (Amy Steel).  I also found that the fight sequences could have been better.  The window shock scene near the end was a good fright, then lead to confusion of whether Paul (john Furey) was dead or was he still alive.
FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2, like the original film was overall good on DVD.  The film was shown for the first time in standard widescreen (1.85:1) format.  The picture quality was amazing too and the sound was quite good, despite its Mono sound.  However, Paramount did NOT restore the lost footage (moreless the murders), as they promised to do when the DVD was released.  There was also a lack of extras here, too as just a theatre trailer was included.  Overall, FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 is the same film as it ever was which falls flat on its face.

While I found the original a bit more entertaining, generally, if you liked the first, you'll like this.  They're generally the same films.  I was just as scared watching this as I was watching the original when I was a kid.  The gruesome deaths and make-up are well done, and the style of the murders are as fun as they were first time around.  The side dialogue taking place between the counselors as they wait to get killed is entertaining at best, and once again, it works well with a crowd.  The ending is pretty dramatic, as well, regardless of the fact that it's not completely logical.  More deaths, bigger body count--what more could you ask for?  Were you expecting ""The Godfather Part II""?
The plot is simple, which works with this type of film, as camp counselors gather to open camp around the same area the first film took place, ""Camp Blood"".  The aforementioned Crystal Lake has been deemed off-limits, but that doesn't stop foolish counselors from exploring the territory.

243519,5,6300214192,"When Friday The 13th hit theatres, and wheeled in a magnificent 25,000,000 dollars at the box office, it was quite obvious there would be a sequel, and some might think that's a bad thing.  Because of the originality, and horror, of the first film, this one has a lot to live up to.  And it, surprisingly, does this very well!!!  I think that this one beats the original by far.  Instead of just the stalking and the killing, there's a lot more action in this one, and a lot more fighting.  We also have a much brighter heroine, who plays her charecter to the hilt, Ginny (Amy Steel, April Fool's Day), and the rest of the cast is much more 3 dimensional than in the first film.  The setting is also a lot more creepy this time around, and the murders are even more creative and just a bit less gory.  Producer/Director Steve Miner (Friday The 13th Part 3, House, Forever Young, Halloween H20 20 Years Later) helped make this sequel what it is.  He is quite good at horror films, and he is propably the man responsible for how scary this one is.
The film picks up two months after the horror of the first film, and we see Alice, our heroine from the first having a nightmareo f that awful night.  After a shower, she opens up her refrigerator, and sees a horrible sight.....  The film jumps to five years later, where we see a new group of counselors seeting up right next to Camp Crystal Lake.  The owner, Paul Holt, gives a chilling story about the legend of Jason Voorhees, who was presumed to have drowned in the same lake, although his body was never recovered.  Jeff and Sandra decide to go and check the camp out, even though they don't know what's there, a strange, mysterious creature lurking in the bushes and waiting to strike. That night a group of counselors go out to town, while others stay at the camp.  The particular date is Friday, June 13th, a very unlucky day,as the counselors will soon find out.......
Part 2 of this series just might be the very best.  There's a bit more comedy in this entry, and that helps the film a lot, but doesn't take away the terror and the horror of the killer.

It's difficult to disagree with the argument that this opportunistic thriller amounts to little more than a re-tread of its infamous predecessor. Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of FRIDAY THE 13th the previous year, Ron Kurz's script places a bunch of young counselors in a training camp next door to 'Camp Blood', whereupon a mad killer (whose identity is fairly obvious from the start) proceeds to wreak bloody havoc.

Given the spate of similar movies which arrived in ""Friday""s wake, ""Part 2"" lacks the element of surprise, but the basic premise still works extremely well, and debut director Steve Miner (graduating from associate producer and unit production manager on the first film) stages the shocks and scares with genuine low-budget flair (note the deft use of Steadicam in the latter stages of the movie). Much of the film's effectiveness is due to surprisingly strong performances by a predominantly young cast (despite some patently inadequate dialogue), with lead Amy Steel providing a good account of herself as a heroine who's determined NOT to fall into stereotype. Betsy Palmer and Walt Gorney provide welcome cameos as Mrs. Voorhees and 'Crazy Ralph' respectively, and the extended climax is both imaginative and genuinely frightening.

It isn't perfect, of course. The lengthy 12 minute prologue is little more than an attempt to pad the meager running time (87 minutes in total), and there's an unpleasant whiff of misogyny evident in a number of scenes where female characters strip down to their underwear before being summarily dispatched by the rampaging killer. MPAA interference has also blunted the impact of several murders (47 seconds were removed at their request), though the remaining footage may still be too much for some viewers. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a date movie that'll have your loved one clinging onto your arm for dear life, this hugely effective shocker will hit the spot every time. For best results, see it with a crowd - and hold onto your popcorn!

243553,2,6300214192,"Well, this does not quite match the first. In this chapter, we lose the element of plausibility that the first one had. Also, I think the death of King in the first scene kills the suspense of the movie. I think it would have been much more effective to see strange things happening, have Geena discuss the situation, and then have her exposed to the truthful reality of what she feared. On the positive side, some images are well done. The characters are pretty well developed, and there are some nice comical moments. Jeff and Sandra make a real likable couple, and it is touching when Vikki falls in love with the handicapped Mark. Also, the story is well constructed in that Part 2 opens up 5 years after Part 1, at a nearby camp, and where fears of the past have not exactly vanished.",975456000,2,789,4.448275862068965

It's been a few months since Alice's days at Camp Crystal Lake and when she killed Mrs. Vorrells and now in her home she meets her son Jason!  Now it's 5 years since camp Crystal Lake was shut down again,but now a man opens a new camp right near Camp Blood (A.K.A)Camp Crystal Lake.he brings in about 15 teenagers on Friday the 13th! About 10 of the teens go w/ him and his girlfriend,ginny to a local bar, While there Jason Vorrells goes have a little fun and soon kills everyone there at camp. Soon Ginny and her boyfriend comes back(with the other ones still at the bar) and is shock to find out that their friends are dead! Minutes later Ginny is running threw the near by woods running from dear ol' Jason where she finds the head of Mrs. Vorrells. soon the movie turns into a basic ripoff of the ending of Friday the 13th minus the Psycho theme music. This movie is a great sequel of Friday the 13th. One thing that makes it better is dear ol' Jason is in it. the bad points are it rips off friday the 13th little too much, crazy ralph got killed and i know i am not alone on this but Ralph was the best man in the whole series, and when you think of  that crazy man Jason u think of the infamous hockey mask witch he doesn't get untill friday the 13th 3. in closing i belive this is the second best friday the 13th of the series behind number 4which is great and i would go as far as to say is compare to halloween!",972086400,2,1571,4.045016077170418

This movie scared me nearly to death, and even now, at age 27, I still  think it's one of the most frightening films I've ever experienced.  Admittedly, the story is rather thin, but director Steve Miner makes up for  it with enjoyable characters (Amy Steel's ""Ginny"" remains my  favorite ""FRIDAY"" girl) a dark, threatening atmosphere, and good  old fashioned, make you jump and scream out loud scares. The final chase  begins an hour in and maintains its tension for the remaining running time  (most horror movies seem to only have a 5 minute or less climax).

But before commenting further, let me just say that Jason seems to me, to be a much more bloodthirsty knockoff of Michael Myers: Think about it; two  silent killers, both wearing white masks, who kill on a whim. However,  Jason has had a much better career than Michael, so I suppose the ends  justify the means. Amy Steel plays Ginny, the heroine majoring in child  psychology, who manages to outsmart Jason. The highlight in this movie  though, has to be the cameo appearance by Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees,  and Adrienne King at the film's opening. Most noticeably absent though, is  Jason's hockey mask, though the bag over his head is an acceptable  alternative. One major blooper though, is seeing that Jason had hair and a  beard in this movie, while all the other sequels clearly show him as bald  as a cueball, and clean shaven. But this movie is still a great one in the  series.",959731200,2,963,4.6390532544378695
243635,4,6300214192,"Warning-some spoilers ahead. This is great! This film has almost everything that a slasher film should be like. What really makes this great is that this is Jason's debut as the killer! he's way cooler and deadlier than  Ms. Voorhees (though I thought she was OK.) A lot of other things make this  great. The acting is pretty good,the plot is great and Harry Manfredini  improved his already excellent score. Jason's  ""Chi,chi,chi,Ha,ha,ha"" sound is awesome too. Amy Steel is a great  actress as Ginny and really shows her potential. She's also the best F13th  heroine to date. Shame she never fought Jason in his hockey mask. Warrington  Gillette does a pretty good job as the grown-up Jason too. What about the  scares? There plentiful. This is easily one of the creepiest of the  series,right up there with Parts 4 and 6. An example of a scary scene is  this-at one point in the film,Ginny is in a dark room with her boyfriend  Paul. When Paul goes to fix the electricity,Ginny has an uncomfortable  feeling that someone is in the room. Then out of nowhere, Jason strikes with  a big-a$$ spear! We all jump at that scene. It's really great. Another  example is when Jason is chasing Ginny with a really big pitchfork  throughout the camp. It's dark and Jason doesn't seem to want to give up. We  all know that Ginny is in danger and we're all hoping she makes it out  alive and not shishkabobed. It's an awesome scene. The scariest scene is by  far the end-Ginny is her cabin and is badly hurt. Paul tries to calm her  down,but then a loud noise is heard. Paul carefully opens the door and we  see a cute little puppy. Just when we think it's safe,Jason strikes  again,but he's unmasked! He looks real ugly too.  Although Jason looks way  better with his hockey mask,he looks OK with a pillow sack (he looks  scarier actually.) What about the gore? For some reason,I found this to be  one of the least goriest of the series. People who say that it was gross  must've seen the DVD transfer. I sadly haven't seen it yet. Overall,Friday 2  is a very cool and scary horror flick. The script is just a rehash of the  first film and nothing more,but this is still a great movie  nothenless. Would've gotten five stars had Jason gotten his hockey mask  (sadly that will never happen.) I still highly recommend this. It's  definitely one the better ones of the series.

Five years after Mrs. Voorhees went on her murder spree, a  counselor training center has opened up right across from the now shut-down  Camp Crystal Lake.

They're always the same thing. I mean, I like getting  the same thing all the time. Sequels should be...SEQUELS!  Look at  Halloween H20. It's sort of a remake of Halloween III, but in a way it's a  sequel to Halloween 6, but it seems to act like 4-6 never happened. It got  lost somewhere in there. And a lot of fans dis-liked it, despite its $50+  million box office take. Look at The Lost World : Jurassic Park. Who would  have liked to have seen the characters from the first film, return to the  park? I got my hand way up! With the Friday The 13th series, the sequels  are the same thing over and over again. Here in Part 2, Jason Voorhees is  handed down the machete from his beloved ax-murdering mother. And went on  to become one of the screen's all-time biggest villains. Ginny, Paul and  the rest of the teenaged, sex-crazed teenagers hang out at a camp ground,  next door to the ol infamous Camp Blood. There's nudity, spear-poking and  cleaver-chopping, and even the crazy old Ralph, who eventually meets his  maker. In the beginning scene, Alice from Part 1, finds Mrs. Voorhees' head  in her refregirator, only to get offed by the soon-to-be hockey  mask-wearing Jason. Yes, thats right. Jason gets the hockey mask, not here,  but in Part 3 (my favorite of the series.) Here as we all know, Jason wears  a one-eyed sack.
There's some great gore and death scenes present in this  horror classic. Including : Jason's VERY FIRST SHISHKABOB KILLING!  A  wheel-chair bound teen gets it, and another teen hanging upside down gets  his throat slit. The FX is just brilliant! Its really awful, that the film  was cut to pieces, due to the MPAA.

I also liked the performances and the characters, and the opening scene was really scary and intense,  especially late at night. i wish all the installments could be this good.",946339200,61,289,4.5576923076923075
243737,1,6300214192,"The same plot as the first, only this time the dead kid out in the lake grows to be an adult and goes around killing the teens. No suspense, no scares, a shocking plot. Watching this only proves to be a waste of time.",945475200,,217,3.9545454545454546
243738,3,6300214192,"Sequel to the original has Jason taking revenge for his mother's decapitation by hacking up another bunch of teens trying to open a summer camp close to Camp Chrystal Lake. Makes no effort to separate itself from  the first, which is probably why this is so enjoyable. Only if you liked  the first.",944524800,,298,4.60377358490566
243739,4,6300214192,"Counselers return to Camp Crystal Lake, only to be killed by Jason. And this time, Jason wears a bag over his head. His face is truly disgusting, with long hair and bushy eyebrows. JASON WEARS A BAG!",943488000,,199,4.405405405405405
243740,5,6300214192,"Probably the only Friday film that offers a complete continuity between it and the first film, Part 2 ends with the most exciting chase scenes this side of Part 3.  More technically polished than the original, but less  creepy, Part 2 also offers a great cast (featuring the series' most  fetching lead actress Amy Steel) and a few good shocks.  Film is hampered  only by the MPAA cut gore effects.  DVD shines in the picture dept and the  sound has never been better offering many ambiance sounds never noticed in  the VHS versions.  Equally, the letterboxed format offers some added  picture to the sides of the frame. Recommended.",941587200,3,633,4.777777777777778
243741,4,6300214192,"Yes that's right, Jason wears a grocery bag instead of his custom Hockey Mask. More of the same graphic murders, including a double impaling with a spear, which happens to 2 teens having intercourse.",939254400,,199,4.882352941176471
243762,3,6300214192,"Amy Steel could proably stand well as the best Friday heroione ever. She has a lot of strength that the others were missing. And am I missing something, or was 1981 a big year for people dying with hammer claws in the  back of the head? It happened both here and in Halloween 2.",938563200,,278,4.148148148148148
243763,3,6300214192,"The only 'Friday' sequel worth sitting through. Thanks to Amy Steel's great heroine and a pre-hockey mask Jason, the suspense has a good chance of building properly. The only thing really bogging it down is-you guessed  it-brainless young campers too busy gettin' busy to worry about a vengeful  psycho stalking the grounds.",931996800,,324,5.211538461538462
