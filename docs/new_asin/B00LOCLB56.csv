6495067,5,B00LOCLB56,"This DVD is terrific - David Suchet, of course, makes it such a joy to listen to.",1418428800,,81,3.823529411764706
6495068,5,B00LOCLB56,COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER,1417478400,,22,4.75
6495069,5,B00LOCLB56,Great! Great! Great!  Scenery and story so informative.  Took you to places you didn't think you would see,1417046400,,106,4.833333333333333
6495070,2,B00LOCLB56,"This show was more about Suchet than St. Peter.  He shrugs and cannot seem to draw any conclusions about whether St. Peter was really a saint and really the first pope.  He was much better as Poirot, and had his heart in that role.",1416009600,,231,4.2272727272727275

6495091,5,B00LOCLB56,David Suchet is a great actor and story teller!,1469059200,,47,4.333333333333333
6495092,4,B00LOCLB56,"I personally didn't like this as much as I did the one David Suchet did on St. Paul, but it was an interesting alternative view of  Peter's life.",1467676800,,145,4.178571428571429
6495093,3,B00LOCLB56,"Historically very interesting - You see the sights and locations of St. Peter's life and get insights from various historians and theologians.  However, some of Suchet's (and even the ""experts'"") musings and speculations are off.  For example, ""Because Peter went to Rome and was martyred there, the Catholic Church believes him to be the first Pope."" Huh?!  Any Catholic can tell you, Peter could've died ANYWHERE on the planet and still been the first Pope.  It was because of the authority Jesus gave him.  Here's another:  ""Why did Jesus go to Jerusalem at that time"" (ie. Passover)?  ""Was it to have a confrontation with the religious authorities?""  Um... Nope.  It was to suffer and die for mankind.  One ""expert"" from Notre Dame says in one sentence, if Peter was really martyred in Rome, he would NOT have been crucified.  This was a ""later tradition.""  Then in her next sentence she says, ""The Romans might have crucified him.""  Ok.  Why say he wasn't (it was a later tradition) then that he might have been?  Speaking of ""experts,"" the Holy Land is chock full of Orthodox and Catholic priests and theologians.  Where were they in this film???  I recommend this film for the sights and sounds and interesting historical tid bits it offers, some of which are quite rich and interesting, such as Suchet's adventure aboard a fishing boat and with the shepherd.  Look for your theology elsewhere!",1462233600,,1401,4.864406779661017
6495094,5,B00LOCLB56,MY WIFE AND I FOUND THIS dvd TO BE VERY INTERESTING AND ENJIOYABLE!,1458518400,,67,4.230769230769231
6495095,5,B00LOCLB56,Very direct and clear explanation of the gospel stories regarding the apostle Peter,1457827200,,83,5.461538461538462
6495096,5,B00LOCLB56,"I was skeptical about buying this and was thoroughly impressed, and could not shut it off. What a good journey with one of my favorite actors.",1456790400,2,142,4.5
6495097,5,B00LOCLB56,This one works fine and is as good as expected.,1454025600,,47,3.8
6495098,3,B00LOCLB56,"I wish they would get people that are grounded in the biblical faith, and well versed in its historical attributes to do these documentaries. When you don't have that, then you lose its inspirational significance.",1453420800,,213,5.114285714285714
6495099,5,B00LOCLB56,Love David Suchet. Love Early Christianity.  Does it get better?,1452816000,,64,5.4
6495100,5,B00LOCLB56,"I watched this on PBS and wanted a copy because I enjoyed David Suchet' s adventure. It was an adventure for him because he is a Christian convert from Judaism and so much of what he is doing is discovering the Christian roots. I don't believe it was intended as anything but his journey to places where Christianity not only began, but how it is evolving. If you want theology or a more in depth look at the Christian history I suggest you look for books by Fr. Mitch Packwa who is not only one of the more knowledgeable historians but also participated in archaeology in the Holy Land, speaks Aramaic...the language Jesus spoke, and speaks at least four other languages since he gave yearly tours to the Holy Land for many years until his final tour this past Christmas.
David Suchet is just a neophyte (except for his great acting) and it is easy to see how much he enjoyed his journey. I am buying his DVD on St. Paul next and hope he does more.",1452556800,9,949,4.367231638418079
6495111,5,B00LOCLB56,"Love David Suchet and this was fascinating, like an armchair tour.",1449014400,,66,5.090909090909091
6495112,5,B00LOCLB56,Great Info and Presentation and Presentation on St Peter and the Early Christian Church...,1446595200,,90,5.5
6495113,5,B00LOCLB56,"David Suchet has been a favorite actor of mine since I first saw him as Hercule Poirot on TV. Since I am a dedicated Christian, the title of this DVD set grabbed me and I had to order it. So glad I did! Mr. Suchet, a dedicated Christian himself, goes to the Holy land and begins learning from the learned locals all he can glean about the life and times of St. Peter and how he became first a Christian and then how he began traveling the land and spreading the Gospel. This is a great historical explanation of Peter's life and dedication to his life's work as a Christian teacher who spread the word and wrote some of the greatest parts of the New Testament. If you are a new or old Christian, this is an extremely valuable work on how to understand the birth and growth of Biblical teachings and how they can be used to continue spreading the Word!

Thank you, Amazon, for the chance of finding and owning this great work!!!",1446076800,7,927,4.297142857142857
6495114,5,B00LOCLB56,"Love both of his DVDs  ""Footsteps of St. Peter"" and ""Footsteps of St. Paul""
Beautiful scenery and he stays strictly with Bible text and teaching.
Hope he continues to make more Bible theme DVDs.",1445904000,3,194,4.705882352941177
6495115,5,B00LOCLB56,In the Footsteps of St Peter was good. Unfortunately In the Footsteps of St Paul was not suitabe for playing in the UK as it was for the wrong region. It has been given to friends who are returning to America.,1444780800,,209,4.121951219512195
6495116,5,B00LOCLB56,It's a very down-to-earth and charming exploration of the Gospels and the relationship between Jesus and St. Peter.,1444089600,,115,5.444444444444445

6495126,5,B00LOCLB56,"I also liked the St. Paul video. To me though, this one is even better. Can't really explain why. I wish Suchet could talk more freely about his faith. Good video though. Worth the price.",1431561600,,187,4.371428571428571
6495127,5,B00LOCLB56,"Excellent DVD - very good material from experts in history of biblical events - not too wordy by David Suchet - He keeps briefly to the facts but

6495145,5,B00LOCLB56,"I have been a huge fan of David Suchet for years, and so I approached this documentary with a note of trepidation.  What if he turned out to be jerk?  I should not have worried.  Mr. Suchet is an absolutely charming guide on a tour of the life and travels of St. Peter.  He makes the trip very intimate yet informative.  My wife enjoyed it so much that, only a few days after watching it, she requested that we watch it again so that she could absorb it even better.",1424217600,13,466,4.133333333333334

6495149,5,B00LOCLB56,"I watched and showed In the Footsteps of St. Paul to my church's Adult Forum.  It was very successful.
Because of the fine quality of David Suchet's personality and mannerisms, I purchased In the Footsteps of St. Peter.
I was equally impressed and I highly recommend both series to those who would like to understand better the lives of these great
men who helped to change the world.",1423612800,13,384,4.647058823529412

6495151,5,B00LOCLB56,"I am impressed with Suchet's documentaries (Peter & Paul). It is fascinating to see the locations where Peter may have traveled and hear Suchet's take on their characters. As an actor, that is very important to him. Personally, I had not considered Peter's humanity very much.",1420416000,5,276,5.021739130434782
