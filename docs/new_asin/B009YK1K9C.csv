This is a story about a flight from Hawaii to California on a four engine propeller driven airliner. It tells about the crew and passengers stories and lives. [This started with Chaucers Canterbury Tales in medieval times.] It serves as a witness to the culture and attitudes of that era. Note the little boy who wears a toy pistol on the trip, and the smoking in the cabin. Do they still use the term dumb bunny? People could carry a pistol on board, the Right to Keep and Bear Arms was respected in those days. What if one passenger starts to make trouble?

Some notice an unevenness in the engines. Then one engine has a fire! This is extinguished but the speed and altitude are decreased. A local ship gets their radio message and relays it to San Francisco. A rescue team is alerted so it can fly towards them. This airliner passed the point of no return; they can only go forward. The Coast Guard lives up to its motto {Semper Paratus). The loss of fuel means they will have to ditch in the sea. The passengers are told what to do. Baggage will be discarded to lighten the load. If the wind changes they may reach the coast. The crisis affects people, we hear them speak their minds.

The navigator recalculates their position, his original calculation was wrong, they cant make land. Eleven more minutes of fuel would allow them to land. Is there a way to compensate? Life vests are passed out to everyone on board, they will be inflated when they go into the water. The co-pilot has a plan - shut down another engine to save fuel. They approach the coast, they are warned of their lowered altitude. The airport lights are turned on. Another engine acts up, its blades are feathered. Full power for the remaining two engines. Wheels and flaps are lowered, and they land safely! The passengers and crew leave the airliner. One is arrested by the police, we see the family of another [comic relief].

This is an entertaining movie that does not have a lot of action for its dramatic story. The use of ships for long distance travel declined in the 1950s and flying grew in popularity [after the sinking of the Andrea Doria]. Was this movie designed to promote air travel? A song associated with this movie was very popular.",1427846400,,2286,4.527845036319612
