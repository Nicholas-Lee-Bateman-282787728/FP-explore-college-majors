Some instructional videos will get you all the bell and whistles,(split screen/full tab notation) but with this one? You cut right to the chase.
He explains, as if you were sitting right in front of him in his studio, what 'modes' or scales work over what chord positions.

Isn't that all you really needed to know in the first place all these years? LOL!

The only thing I would have liked is a short description of the guitar, amp and strings he was using.
And that PICK? Wha? It's a huge yellow triangle! I have NEVER seen another guitar player use one
of those, so I'd like the background story how he came to use such a unique pick shape and size.

Bottom Line? A friendly, well taught personal lesson from a man who wrote the book on playing electric guitar 'outside the box', literally.

By the way: Will Ray's rendition of 'Sweet Dreams' is still the greatest single tribute to Roy Buchanan, ever.
