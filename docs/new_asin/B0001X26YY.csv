8017567,1,B0001X26YY,"What could be spookier than an evil spirit returning to his town for some demonic revenge for horrors visited upon him and his loved ones by the townsfolk generations ago?  Um, quite a lot actually, but in the right hands this could be a concept resulting in something to give little kids nightmares. In the hands of the makers of The Demons of Ludlow it just comes across as nothing special.

The town of wherever-the-heck-this-is gets a piano as a special gift from the family of the town founder.  It's actually inhabited by said evil spirit who starts killing people.  One curious gal (whose name I can't remember either as an actor or character  that's just the effect this film has on me) begins investigating the history which is suspiciously absent from official records.  The girl, a preacher, and the demons/spirits face off in a battle that will leave you yawning and sleepy-eyed.

The story is disjointed and often illogical.  Sometimes it seems like the demons hide the bodies of their victims, and sometimes it seems like the corpses are left for others to find. One death in particular is talked about like a strangulation then later as a dismembering.  Which is it?  We don't see it for ourselves so you figure it out.  Perhaps it was called a strangulation in order to spare the gory details from family members?  Your guess is as good as mine because the story gives no indication, and the character reactions offer no clues.

Sometimes it seems like the attacks are linked to the piano (which, by the way, sounds NOTHING like a piano to the viewing audience which doesn't strike the characters as odd), and sometimes it seems like the demons and piano are only loosely linked. Is there one demon/spirit or are there several in a hellish conspiracy? For that matter what are we even dealing with? The spirits of the dead? Demons? Spirits who became demons? Do the preacher and his wife have tension in their marriage or are they hunky dory with each other?  These things seem to be whatever a particular scene needs them to be without worrying about staying consistent throughout the movie.

There's obviously a history between the evil spirits and the town, but the explanation is so badly written Im still not quite sure what exactly happened.  That's a shame because the concepts sound like they could be crafted into a fairly decent narrative.  Basically it works out to be a revenge plot from beyond the grave which could have opened the doors for some great ambiguity about who is really the villain and who is justified in their actions.  Instead, people just do what they do without much weight given to logic or consistency.

The demonic attacks are generally pretty goofy although there are a couple of times where I thought they might surprise me and pull off something worth seeing.  What intriguing moments try to creep in are quickly squashed by poor storytelling.

The acting isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it's still weak.  This might be why I've never heard of any one of the actors before.  Of particular annoyance is that they don't sell the piano playing even a little bit. I guess thats not so much the fault of the actors, though; the music we hear is obviously not being played by the person shown on screen at the piano.  If you can't make it look like the piano is actually being played then don't show the piano being played so much! But then again why start using any coherent logic now?

Content:
There are some shots of heads being whacked off and other less graphic violence. There is a little bit of nudity and some sexuality.

DVD:
This is available on at least 2 of those big 50 movie mega-packs: Fright Classics and Chilling Classics.  The audio on both is fair meaning you can understand everything being said but don't go getting your surround sound hooked up for it.  The FC print has video that is shifty and somewhat unclear.  The CC print is slightly grainy but less shifty.  There are no extras for either one.

Ive seen rumors of a remastered DVD edition out there, but I cant actually find it. Comments make it sound like its not worth the effort anyway. I found a few import options, but details on them are sketchy at best. Youre better off streaming or getting it in a movie mega-pack.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
If the backstory had been presented better I might consider letting this have a slightly better rating.  The letdown of the ending just ensures this doesn't rise above the dregs of the lowest numbers.  If you like bad horror movies there are plenty out there that are more fun than this one.  Avoid it unless you're looking for something to poke fun at. 1*.",1523923200,,4629,4.638036809815951

8017569,2,B0001X26YY,"I wish I could rate this movie higher, but...on the bright side, the sound (MPEG) is an improvement over the previous DVD-R: all dialogue is now clear, not that it matters much! Not surprisingly, the picture is not noticeably improved, with plenty of pixels swarming the background browns and blacks. I like the loopy sound of the ""piano"" soundtrack, sort of a bizarre blend of ""Tubular Bells"" and John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" The story, what there is, seems to echo JC's ""The Fog"" a little, but feels undeveloped overall. Still, there are some decent images and atmosphere throughout, plus a better DVD cover than before. Enjoy!",1421452800,,630,5.0095238095238095
8017570,3,B0001X26YY,"ok, this is a low-budget horror film.  The plot is essentially about a curse that a family (now dead) puts on a small town.  (the film is not clear as to the motivation for this).

one character is a reporter who is investigating the curse.  During her investigation, people start dying all over the town by super-natural means.

the curse is somehow connected to a old piano that was given by a donor during the town's recent celebration of it's incorporation, which was in 1776.  Whenever someone plays on the piano, another person seems to die.

* fans of 80's horror films should enjoy this.",1296000000,,595,4.609523809523809

8017572,2,B0001X26YY,"A haunted piano (!) arrives in the small town of Ludlow, just in time for the bicentennial celebration. Weirdness ensues, as descendants of the town's founders wind up murdered in horrible ways. A little girl appears to many victims, along with a group of ""demons"", who look an awful lot like ordinary people in old clothes, who kill-kill-KILL! The piano itself is possessed by an old warlock named Ephram Ludlow. Ephram had his hands cut off and wants them back! With it's half-hearted acting and drama-school special effects, DEMONS OF LUDLOW is nothing spectacular. I give it 2 stars because a couple of the death scenes were semi-interesting...",1129075200,4,648,5.0092592592592595
