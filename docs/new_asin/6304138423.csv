7863315,5,6304138423,"A great story of that unique period between World War I and The Great Depression when England was king and there wasn't a cloud in sight.  And the idle rich could be idle.  Not that nothing interesting ever happened.  But, when interesting things did come along you might have the need to call  on your trusted manservent to help you get out of the mess.
