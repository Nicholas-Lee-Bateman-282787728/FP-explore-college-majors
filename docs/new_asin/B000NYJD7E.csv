2788734,5,B000NYJD7E,"This was a favorite of a lot of my friends so I decided to watch it.  It was great.  I enjoyed it very much.  The music was haunting.  The characters were well developed and easy to relate to and like.  The story is about two couples from different eras.  Even the scene-jumping from present to past was very clear and fell together.  And I love happy endings, though I cried buckets of tears in-between.",1388448000,,404,4.378378378378378

Few films of today can compare with the tenderness of pure romantic love displayed in silent film, or the depth and glow sound brought to romance during the classic film era, but over the past decade, South Korea has blended something wonderful from both art forms and captured a transcendent beauty unmatched. A sense of longing for love and happiness just out of reach hangs over many of their finest romanticist efforts giving them an emotional ache not felt when watching anything else. An epic love story, The Classic is a beautiful river, filled with love and longing, promise, and dreams shattered by fate and circumstance. Like all rivers, it keeps flowing, eventually returning to where it began, completing a circle.

Son Ye-jin gives a tender and beautiful performance in a dual role as two love stories are played out over time, intertwined and connected in ways which only become clear in the final heartbreaking moments. Jo Seung-woo as Joon-Ha, and Lee Ki-woo as his friend, Tae-Su, make a considerable contribution to the story of Joo-hee (Son Ye-jin), told in flashback. Son Ye-jin also portrays the daughter of Joo-Hee, Ji-Hae, during the present day. Jo Ing-sung as Sang-Min, and Lee Soo-in as her possessive friend, Su-Kyeong, round out the modern day triangle as letters and diaries of her mother help her understand the present. Written and directed by Kwak Jae-yong with great sensitivity and understanding, the director of My Sassy Girl and Windstruck gets everything perfect here, right down to the music. Everything from Beethoven to The Swinging Blue Jean's Hippy Hippy Shake is used to wonderful effect. Most beautiful, however, is the haunting Saranghamyon halsoorok (If We Are in Love, Then..) used to underscore many tender and emotional moments in both love stories.

Ji-Hae (Son Ye-jin) is going through a box of her mother's love letters and diaries as this epic love story opens, and soon it will lead to flashbacks showing a parallel between past and present. Ji-Hae has been writing love letters for her girlfriend Su-Kyeong (Lee Soo-in) so she can get and hold on to her popular boyfriend, Sang-Min (Jo In-sung). It works well except that Ji-Hae has fallen in love with him herself while doing so. Insecure, possessive, and sensing Sang-Min has unspoken feelings for her friend Ji-Hae, Su-Kyeong constantly reminds her just who his girlfriend is. Son Ye-jin is marvelous here, shy and demure, with little hope of happiness because her best friend has everything she loves. Sweet, she immerses herself in the love story of her mother, only to find parallels to the present, and a deeper understanding at the right moment, which comes after a romantic run in the rain with the boy she loves. By this time, the viewer is deeply involved in the story of her mother, Joo-Hee, as it is told in flashback. Perhaps a more romantic and heartbreaking story has never been put on film.

If Son Ye-jin is marvelous as the daughter, Ji-Hae, she is ethereal as Joo-Hee, giving a Janet Gaynor type performance not seen since Seventh Heaven or Street Angel. The situation in which her daughter finds herself is reversed in flashback, with Joon-Ha (Jo Seung-woo) writing letters for his best friend Tae-Su (Lee Ki-woo) so he can get the lovely pig-tailed daughter of an important man. It is Joon-Ha who is enchanted by Joo-Hee, however, and as their love grows, so does their guilt, as Tae-Su is a good friend and loves her also. These two triangles, decades apart, becoming deeply involving, filled with charm and tenderness, and humor. To reveal too many details would be a disservice in regards to this film, where so much happens. Sprawling, yet intimate, with a sense of tragedy somewhere down the road the viewer can't quite get a handle on, this is a beautiful film all classic film fans will adore and embrace. A cross between Maytime and Random Harvest, it is a film never to be forgotten once seen. A haunted house, a run in the rain with no umbrella, and fireflies at night become magical recorded moments of love told through flashback. Even war intrudes on happiness in this romantic poem to love being a river.

A necklace may be the link between the past and present, so that love can finally overcome fate, in this lovingly rendered and beautifully acted film only Korea could make. Heartbreaking on one front and hopeful on another, director Kwak Jae-yong shows love as a river which always comes back for those who wait and hope for what seems just out of reach. Often difficult to find, great romanticist films are still being made, and South korea is leading the way. This version is for those who require a region three DVD, but it can be found in other formats. Worth tracking down a copy. A beautiful film.",1320364800,,4786,4.860294117647059
