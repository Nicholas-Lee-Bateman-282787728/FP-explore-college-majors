8266425,5,B0017LIGYS,"It is shame that some African-American families cannot get the land that their grandparents/great-grandparents lost during the late 1800s-early 1900s due to discrimination.  It did bring me to tear up in seeing how they lost their land. A definite ""must see"".",1399248000,3,259,5.317073170731708
8266426,5,B0017LIGYS,"Thank God for the true reality of American history. I purchased this to help inspire the younger generations to know the truth of America, look at how things actually are today and pray this DVD will improve and inspire our younger generations to get out and vote to ensure that which happened in America's past history as well as what is happening today with our Congress, our various political leaders who are against the masses of people in our society will not continue today and in our future America.",1397606400,4,506,4.696629213483146

8266428,5,B0017LIGYS,This documentary should be required viewing in every high school in America. This part of American History is not in any textbook in the good old U. S. A.,1387152000,,154,4.344827586206897
8266429,5,B0017LIGYS,"This DVD is worth the price of $26.95. I will say that first, because I do not pay that much for DVD's at all. I purchase most of our DVD's used between the price of $1.00 to $6.00 at the most. So I said that to say, this DVD has very valuable information for me to pay that price.

I did not want to pay the price, but once I received the DVD and heard the sound of the DVD I was skeptical because the DVD started off sounding muzzled. Once the DVD was past the introduction, the sound was excellent! The picture quality is great as well. The case is of good quality, no booklet included. I wish there was a booklet included. This DVD came single with art work on the DVD. Shipping was fast and package was great. So I have no complaints.

We watched this DVD as a family and this was very informative for our children and the adults. It is also lost history that a lot of people want buried. This is very painful, however in order to heal and move forward, gain closure, we need to know what took place in these times so that we will know the truth.

You will enjoy Banished, take time to know your history and see how our ancestors made do and made communities and lived life. It would have been nice if Black Wall Street was included. Racial cleansing was a part of history, and that is hidden unless you go looking for it.

As painful as Racial Cleansing was and is to read about, you still need to know what took place and the how and why. Banished will deliver that information to you. You will see what families lost, you will see how some became land owners off of the hard work of others.  This is very eye opening and will make you think. This should be taught in schools so that children know the truth.

This is a great teaching resource that will inform you and have you wanting more. We found our selves wanting more and did not want Banished to end. So we ordered more information on this subject matter: Freedom Colonies (book) by Sitton Thad, Sundown Towns by James W. Loewen, Buried in bitter waters by Elliot Jaspin, and searched this subject matter on the internet like Black Wall Street in Tulsa Oklahoma.

This is great subject matter to add to your collection to teach about history that was hidden. This will give you an understanding of how and why African Americans were ran out of town and off their land. You need to know how life was during this era. Banished is a great start, and will give you great food for thought.

After watching Banished:

Do your own research and find out who Jesse Washington of Waco, Texas the Waco Horror was and what happened to him. Mary Jane of Valdosta, Georgia what happened to her, her unborn child and her husband. Look up Black Wall Street, Know your history and remember this did not happen a thousand or two thousand years ago. This is recent your grand parents, great grand parents, parents aunts and uncles lived this.

Knowledge is power.",1374624000,13,2909,4.3406998158379375
8266430,5,B0017LIGYS,"A very good documentary to say the least. Learned a lot about fairly recent American history as it relates to many small towns, and it is a shame that extreme racism is a big big part of it.",1374624000,4,190,4.026315789473684
8266431,5,B0017LIGYS,This is a great book.  The history of banishing and removing African Americans from land that they owned is a history that should be taught in the schools across America.  Definitely recommended reading.,1367107200,2,203,5.121212121212121
