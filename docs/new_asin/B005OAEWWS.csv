8481083,1,B005OAEWWS,"I bought this dvd set from Costco and had it several months before I opened it.  To my surprise, all the dvd's in the set do not work on my dvd player.  The information and tag for the company issuing the dvd set is there but nothing else.  I also noticed in looking through the dvd set is one has to do with ""December 7, 1943 which documents the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.  Pearl Harbor was bombed in December 7, 1941.  I wonder who collected these videos and now I am hoping that Costco can look up this sale and refund my purchase price.  I am a WW2 fan and would have loved to seen this set of WW2 videos.  I have a Sony BluRay player and this dvd set should have played on it and I also tried it on my computer.  There are just no movies on the discs.",1359763200,4,771,3.9934640522875817
8481084,4,B005OAEWWS,"This is not to be confused with the 4-disc set from 2007 titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Goes-to-War/dp/B000NY1EA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Goes to War</a>&nbsp;(no exclamation point).

This is an 18 disc set in 6 volumes of 3 discs each. As of this date (the 68th anniversary of D-Day), there are no reviews posted and Amazon's description does not list the films included.  I will not attempt to review or evaluate the content leaving that to others more knowledgeable.  Having the set in my possession, I would like to make some general comments and provide a complete list of the films in the set.

All of the films are either documentaries or military training films.  Some have dramatized scenes and could be called ""docudramas"".  Some feature  well-known Hollywood actors and directors.  A number of the films were Oscar winners. Most of the films are about WWII but several deal with the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. Several films seem out of place. Who's Out There, is not about ANY war but is a 30 min. 1975 documentary narrated by Orson Welles which speculates about life on other planets.  One wonders why it and several others were included in a set titled ""Hollywood Goes To War!"".

The films have not been restored in any way and the quality varies depending on the source materials.  Most are in B&W, several are in color. The outer case of the set measures roughly 11''x 8''x 2'' and contains 6 folding DVD cases (Vols I-VI) containing 3 discs each in slots.
