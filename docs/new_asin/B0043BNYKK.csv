8414555,5,B0043BNYKK,"I had never heard of The Poodles until they were booked for the upcoming Melodic Rock Festival in October 2014.  I checked out several of their videos on YouTube and was very impressed.  After searching for all the bands CDs on Amazon, I decided to purchase the ""In the Flesh"" DVD and ""No Quarter"" CD combo pack.

I have seen hundreds of music documentaries about artists, classic albums, studios and even music fans but this is the best I have ever seen.  ""In the Flesh"" contains live performances mixed with great interviews, fan interactions and a history of the band.  You have the option of watching just the live concert footage by itself like one uninterrupted concert or watching with documentary footage between each song.

All of the band members seen very personable and love interacting with their fans.  A special segment is given to each band member to show them in their private lives and explain how they got interested in music.  I was very impressed with the anti-drug messages and the fact that their audience is comprised of young children all the way up to grandparents.

They only thing bad I can say about this DVD is that it is only in stereo.  If they would re-master this for Blu-ray with a lossless soundtrack, I would double dip in a heartbeat.

I was so impressed with this DVD that I went on Amazon and bought all five Poodles CDs.  I am really looking forward to meeting these guys at Melodic Rock Fest!",1396569600,,1434,4.602362204724409
