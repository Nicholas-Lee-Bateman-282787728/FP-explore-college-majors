2736807,4,B000MM0LEQ,"My Young Auntie is very much a shaw brothers kung fu classic.  The cinematography and action falls very much in line with these classics.  What makes My Young Auntie special is that it stars a woman and is very much a comedy.  I can't help but rave about the star.  She had a very difficult role, as she had to be both young and insecure, but still a great fighter and strong leader.  She did both very well, and the movie was a success.  Though I usually don't care too much about special features, I was very impressed with those on this set.  They brough back a number of cast and crew, and provided a very good insight into the actual movie.  I was very surprised how much fun this movie was, and can't recomend it enough.  Give it a try!  (And if you do, look for a disguised cameo but kung fu legend Gordon Liu).",1259107200,,818,4.185897435897436
2736808,5,B000MM0LEQ,"I had never seen this movie before purchasing it but I knew of it's reputation as one of the first kung-fu comedies and I was intrigued. Besides I like girls who can kick ass. I found it to be very entertaining, the fight choreography was very good, and it was far funnier then I thought it was going to be and the star, Kara Hui looks beautiful. Like alot of the Shaw Brothers movies; they have a somewhat dated feel to them but I think it works in it's favor as a bridge between what kung-fu movies were in the 1970' and early '80's and what they have become now. I highly reccomend this movie because it's fun, lighthearted, and a little sexy.",1254528000,3,646,4.260162601626016
2736809,4,B000MM0LEQ,"Kara Hui is excellent in this film and its so nice to see her in a starring role. Near the middle-end she kind of steps aside as the main character and othe characters are introduced. If you are looking for non-stop action then this isn't the movie. Not to put this movie down though because it comes across as a comedy. There are several good fight scences but this movie also has a good plot to it and that is another reason why you should purchase it. There is a good chinese sword vs. fencing technique fight in the middle of the movie. The ending fight could have been a little better but it doesnt disappoint too much. If you like great kung fu, good plot line, and the beautiful kara hui then this is the movie for you.",1233014400,,726,4.23021582733813
2736810,3,B000MM0LEQ,"I was thrilled to see the new release of the Shaw Brothers martial arts films on DVD.  I remember sitting in front of the TV every Saturday in the '70's and '80's watching Kung Fu movies.  And Shaw Brothers films were always the best.

Having said this, My Young Auntie was a waste of film.  There are a few good fights, but the attempts at comedy totally bog the film down.  Perhaps to an Asian audience this film is hilarious.  Jackie Chan, in an interview about the Rush Hour movies, stated that he really doesn't understand American humor.  Perhaps this is my problem with this film -- I may not understand Chinese humor.

In any case, if you are a hardcore fan of the Shaw Brothers films. buy this for your collection.  If you are looking for an action-packed classic Kung Fu movie, look elsewhere.",1223510400,2,803,4.482758620689655
2736811,4,B000MM0LEQ,"I noticed an error in the details; the screen format is 2:35:1, not 1:66:1, and there are quite a few extras like an awesome 22 minute interview with the ""Young Auntie"" herself, Kara Hui Ying-Hung and original widescreen Shaw Brothers trailers. This is NOT a bootleg, this is a re-mastered version of a great Liu Chia-liang (Lau Kar-leung) movie. I'm not going to go into the plot, but I will say that this one is a Liu comedy. If his brand of comedy appeals to you, you will definitely enjoy this. Besides, the fu (choreography by Liu & Hsiao Hou) is absolutely incredible. Many great cameos by Gordon Liu (who sings and plays guitar here), Kwon Young-Moon, Wilson Tong & Yuen Tak (one of Jackie Chan's classmates during their Opera school days). Many great set-pieces including a ballroom dance turning into an all-out brawl, European fencing versus Chinese swordplay & the numerous martial bouts towards the film's end, culminating with a fantastic bout between Johnny Wang & Liu Chia-liang (seen on the bottom of the DVD's cover). In short, a classic Liu Chia-liang comedy, a great looking DVD by Dragon Dynasty; crisp, blemish- free picture, widescreen, clear audio & re-mastered subtitles.

2736814,3,B000MM0LEQ,"Considered by many to be a Kung Fu classic, this Lau Kar-Leung flick is another of those films that has much to enjoy, however; the material in between those scenes can be pretty rough!  Kara Hui is introduced here as the central character(The Young Auntie if you will).  Although nice to look at and a strong female lead, I found her character to be fairly unlikeable and her fighting scenes are probably the worst in the film.  Hsiao Hou plays the charismatic nephew who is always trying to show his Kung Fu superiority (great facial expressions) and is impressive even when scripted into campy situations(like sword-fighting with a small army knife while dressed as Peter Pan!?).  Lau Kar-Leung steals the show to no real suprise.  He is obviously the best fighter of the entire cast(although Gordon Liu shows up in a bit part) and is electric throughout.  The movie clocks in at roughly 2 hours and even though there are fight scenes scattered through the first hour and a half it is the final half hour, filled with Kung Fu mayhem and Leung and Hou fighting alongside to rescue thier Aunt that saved this for me.  And that great finale is what elevates this to the 3 stars I gave it... everything up until then is worth watching once but rather forgettable.  If you do enjoy the genre comedy elements of this era(slapstick, misunderstandings, sexual inuendo, bizzare situations, dance routines, etc.) than this is a must own... these are the elements that brought the film down for me personally.  Either way this is worth a viewing and the DVD release by Dragon Dynasty is top notch as always(special features are a rare letdown though).",1189382400,3,1643,4.757042253521127

2736843,5,B000MM0LEQ,"some spoilers:

This movie is so underrated and timeless. I've watched a lot of Kung Fu movies with plots set in the 1980s in modern Hong Kong cities. At the time they were all the rage while Shaw Brothers was growing less popular as the 80s progressed.  Fast forward a few decades later, and those Shaw Brother movies have withstood the test of time while all of those trendy so called ""kung fu"" movies set in the big city look horrifically dated!

My Young Auntie was released in 1981, with a circa set some time in the 1940s or 50s if one were to judge by the ""motor cars"" and fashion. As a period piece it's authentic, despite being filmed on a Shaw Brothers sound stage.

Kara Hui plays Ching Dai Nan, young student of the dying elder of the Yu family. He convinces her to marry him, with instructions to protect his assets from his malevolent brother. She must bequeath her late husband's estate to his nephew Yu Jing Chuen. Young Auntie takes her charge seriously. As the wife of an elder, second uncle, she becomes an elder of the family despite her young age. She soon meets her nephew, but Yu Jing Chuen is much older than she expected. He is also surprised that his Auntie is young enough to be his daughter. Comedy ensues when his  teenage son (Hsiao Ho) arrives, who is around the same age as Young Auntie.

Yu Jing Chuen's son, Ah Tao (Who likes to be called Charlie Yu) has his ""daddy"" wrapped around his finger. He has been away to Hong Kong for school where he is learning English. Ah Tao is enamored with western culture which causes him to clash with his traditional young ""aunt"". His father commands Charlie to treat his aunt (who is an elder) with deference. But Charlie remains resentful and disrespectful, especially when ""daddy"" threatens to take away his schooling after he fails to keep a protective eye over Grand Auntie (let's just say she ends up in a sexy dress cut to high heavens, and a pair of torn panty hose) after a trip to the big city.

The movie plays up Kara Hui's attractive looks and if you're not paying attention, it also plays up the alpha male-ness of Hsiao Hou who for many of his scenes parades around with his shirt half-buttoned when he's not being a smart-ass.

Charlie embodies a western teenager's attitude and Hsiao Ho plays him very well. He's unjustifiably cocky, and a bit of a snob. Eventually, his antics gets them in trouble, and both Young Auntie and Charlie will soon need the wisdom of their elders to help them out.

Both are experts in Kung Fu. Auntie using a southern fighting style, and Charlie preferring to use both southern and northern styles, with a bit of western boxing thrown in. Dad is traditional and kicks butt. The movie ends with amazing and very entertaining fight scenes culimating to a battle of ""my dad can beat up your dad"". Of course, Charlie and Auntie, whose mild flirtation is built on competition, strive to outdo each other.

There are a few romantic moments between the two as they try to avoid awkward encounters, such as Charlie serenading Grand Auntie, (whom he also ocassionally refers to Grandmother when he speaks to her in English). A date to a dance where they play dress up as westerners. There is also an awkward moment when Charlie (who at first despises her) discovers his grand auntie (or grandmother?) in a sexy dress. We also get a really funny proposal that doesn't end well for Charlie.

Terrific performance by Kara Hui as a young woman who must embody the spirit of an older woman, and Lau Kar Leung as the dad, who is also hilarious and he is very skilled at Kung Fu. Of course, I prefer Hsiao Hou, he makes the movie funny and entertaining for me. His fighting style is unpredictable and different from the other characters in the movie.",1297987200,,3750,4.5325443786982245
2736844,5,B000MM0LEQ,"I really enjoyed this movie.

The story premise is good. A young girl marries an older man in order to save his martial arts school from being taken over by an evil relative.
She (having learned Kung-Fu in the very school she inherits) is amazing in her fight scenes.
And when she meets and teams up with the rest of her in-laws, it's funny as they try to understand why this young girl is their ""elder"".
The fight scenes are typical but well choreographed and executed. The comedy elements add to this movie without being too ""hokey"" for comedy's sake.

This is another Dragon Dynasty release and I'm very impressed with the quality of the films they've been putting out. The picture is clean and the remastering is top-notch.
The special features include an interview with the lead character played by actress Kara Hui, which is nice to get her input on how this movie came to be and what it was like to be in it.

I would very much recommend this movie to others who are a fan of Kung-Fu films.",1290297600,,997,4.437158469945355
2736845,5,B000MM0LEQ,"This was a great movie, it has some comdey in it but over all it was very good. Lots of action you can not help cheer for young Auntie as she takes on the bad guys. Great actions and fight scens.",1284336000,,195,3.7804878048780486
2736846,4,B000MM0LEQ,"Not that the gorgeous, skillful Kara Hui starred in so many classic martial arts pictures, but for damn sure she made an impact in her day. MY YOUNG AUNTIE - which to me is much cooler than its alternative title FANGS OF THE TIGRESS - is Kara Hui's breakout film. Much like Cheng Pei Pei before her and Michelle Yeoh after her, Kara Hui had no formal martial arts training and so relied heavily on her dance background to help her transition into martial arts cinema. Her performance in MY YOUNG AUNTIE earned her Best Actress honors in the 1982 inaugural Hong Kong Film Awards.

She plays Cheng Tai-Nan, a young woman who, at a dying old man's request, marries him so that his wealth and holdings don't end up in the clutches of his evil brother. Lau Kar-Leung (a.k.a. Liu Chia-Liang) directs and, as is his wont, he gives himself a plum role, this time that of Cheng Tai-Nan's benevolent nephew. I'm certain it won't be lost on the viewer that Lau Kar-Leung is much older than his very young auntie. An amusing early scene on the docks certainly mines this arsebackwards age discrepancy. But Lau Kar-Leung is a gracious filmmaker and he allows his two younger stars to get the brunt of screen time. And the camera loves, loves, loves Kara Hui, with her exquisite smirk and elegance and attitude and mad skills.

MY YOUNG AUNTIE tries on several hats. It's a kung fu actioner, a zany comedy, and, at one point, a musical. Humor being such a subjective animal, whether you favor MY YOUNG AUNTIE or not will ultimately depend on if you can stand the slapstick routines which dominate the film. Admittedly, for me, I think its two hours' running time may be too long, and by that I mean that it allows for too much silliness to go down. The sequence with the masquerade ball is particularly brutal. There were some funny elements, absolutely (like the above mentioned scene at the docks and, later, the bit with the aunt coaching her old out-of-shape relatives-in-law thru a training regimen, thus giving us the hilarious ""Pile Up The Monks"" maneuver). Lau Kar-Leung made a point of introducing Cheng Tai-Nan as a stern and dignified widowed aunt, but this is only so that he could present her in later scenes in which she becomes the brunt of jokes. And it always seems to happen during Cheng Tai-Nan's forays into modern womanhood. Although, to be honest, mostly it's her grand-nephew getting her into scrapes. In a way, Lau Kar-Leung is wryly commenting on the westernization of early 20th century China. Still, a glammed up Kara Hui gets a chance to show off her loverly legs.

The grand-nephew Ah Tao is played by Hou Hsiao, and his kung fu is solid, except that his character here is supremely annoying. Ah Tao (whose English name is ""Charlie"") is a westernized college student and exudes a cockiness that is initially unwarranted. The same age as his grand-aunt, the two right away embark on this sometimes funny, hotly contested rivalry which also doubles as this barely concealed courtship. Their relationship drives much of the story.

Kara Hui's performance throughout and the last 30 minutes are the film's saving grace. The last half hour comprises a series of extended fight sequences, and the fight choreography is awesome. Somewhere in the final act, director Lau Kar-Leung says ""Heck with this!"" and gets back in front of the camera and proceeds to mete out some harsh assskickings. There are several highlights during this half hour, some of them owned by Kwan Yung Moon's thuggish practitioner of hard Qi Gong. That last rumble between Lau Kar-Leung and Wong Lung Wei is also sweet and is rife with various Hung Gar techniques (the crane, tiger, crab, and even a monkey stealing a peach).

Dragon Dynasty DVDs typically come with top notch bonus stuff, and no different here: an audio commentary from film critics/scholars David Chute & Andy Klein (Bey Logan must've been sick or something); bios on the commentators (because absolutely no one wanted to know); an interview with Kara Hui (00:13:05 minutes long with English sub-titles) and an interview with David Chute & Andy Klein who at this point may be getting too much pub (00:07:35); the original theatrical trailer and the New Home Video trailer for MY YOUNG AUNTIE; and a stills gallery.

Kara Hui made several other terrific martial arts films. Off the top of my head: INVINCIBLE POLE FIGHTER, MARTIAL CLUB, LEGENDARY WEAPONS OF CHINA, and THE LADY IS THE BOSS. Also, fans of martial arts star Gordon Liu may be curious to know that he has a cameo in MY YOUNG AUNTIE as Ah Tao's sidekick. You'll know him by his ridiculous wig and that guitar he strums. He's definitely not channeling the monk San Te in this one.",1283126400,2,4690,4.741421568627451

8169872,2,B000MM0LEQ,"A movie for only the most indulgent fan (and judging by the number of four and five star reviews there are a few of them out there) this movie is a truly grating experience that is very much in the vein of the martial arts movie effectively morphed into a dance movie.

The plot is really not so much a plot as a threadbare concept designed to allow the minimum amount of dialogue in between dance numbers - oops I mean fight sequences - and is hard to care about. But then you aren't really supposed to. Effectively it involves the usual long winded dynastic succession of family members and petty inter-family jealousies that really just form the excuse for the aforesaid dance numbers. Oops there I go again, I mean fight sequences. One of the main premises of the movie is that a chap married a much younger woman before kicking the bucket and that this young widow then travels to other family members. Now given the family members were obviously in some form of contact and given that a young lady marrying an older chap is hardly a new concept anywhere in the world you'd think that this would not be a cause for such confusion. But no, it's milked to death in truly squirm inducing episodes. Time and again we have endless slapstick of the dialogue variety as people try to grasp that she is who she is. It's wince inducing.

As the movie plods and plods the whole thing does at least show some good acrobatic ability amongst the players. Certainly a few movies are eyebrow raising and are part of the reason this mess manages to score two stars. Also much of it seems quite nicely shot and the colours are quite vibrant.

A few nicely choreographed - if tediously overlong - scenes of harmless limp-wristed kung fu moves and nice cinematography are not enough however to save this film from being a bottom of the barrel experience. If you are a Shaw Brothers devotee then pick it up very cheaply if you simply must have it. Otherwise steer clear.",1489363200,,1955,4.501408450704226
