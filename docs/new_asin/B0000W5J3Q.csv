1957274,5,B0000W5J3Q,"30 Minutes - Balance Challenge
15 Minuets - Floor Work for arms, abs, and legs

Katalin Rodriguez-Zamiar has three black belts and over 21 years experience in the martial arts and boxing. By looking at her, you would not think ""boxing"" you would be thinking ballerina or perfectly fit dancer. This program uses ballet exercises that require extreme focus and control. Katalin's creativity is exceptional and her instruction style is exquisite. She introduced me to so many new moves, I can hardly describe them all. Her floor work has some beautiful exercises that will require you to have a good basic core of strength already in place.

From the very start of this program I was pretty excited because after doing so many Pilates workouts, I knew most of the floor/standing moves and the focus here is on standing postures and exercises. Yet, they are exercises with a new creative twist. It is even difficult to describe the exercises because they are truly more like a standing dance. Imagine standing and then raising your leg and then moving your body in interesting directions to test your balance. I think she is mainly focusing on the ""tendu en croix"" and ""degage"" with plenty of front and back sweeps where you are standing on one leg and moving the other leg fairly quickly back and in front of you. So, that is the basis and there is a lot of center position focus. The lunges mostly go to the side or are more like a courtesy. I found that they were very easy on the knees and I could actually do them! Yes! Normally lunges are my least favorite, but these were like ""dance lunges"" which moved softly to the side.

The balance element had my full attention. Unless you have been doing Yoga or Pilates for a few years, the balance exercises might really frustrate you. This is definitely not for beginners because you truly do need to know all the basic ballet moves which move at a rather rapid pace in this video.

Katalin is a perfect instructor. Not only does she never make a mistake throughout the entire workout, her cues are right on target and she has a calming beautiful voice. You feel nurtured all while she seems to gently guide you into some rather intense exercises. Your mind is so intrigued with the creativity that you forget you are exercising your body into a fully body sweat.

Standing Pilates Blend is Intermediate/Advanced for sure! I love it and can """"""HIGHLY"""""" recommend it to anyone who loves Pilates and wants to move to what I'd call the ""third"" level. The first being when you learn the moves. The second when you accomplish the exercises. The third when you start to get creative and take each exercise to a new level of intensity. The camera is also in motion and switches from a group exercise situation to individual segments for instruction by crashing waves or a beach scene. This is a visually interesting workout which seems to almost hypnotize you with beauty so you don't even realize you are working as hard as you are.

This is a ""must-have"" workout for anyone who wants to improve their balance. It will also tone your entire body and you will feel your abs and butt tighten and lift even after just one workout if you have been working out on a regular basis.

If you are just starting with Pilates, try Winsor Pilates, Karen Voight and Jennifer Kries first. Those will give you a great overview and teach you the poses and exercises you need to know to master this workout.

1957275,5,B0000W5J3Q,"Since most Pilates DVD's are substantially matwork, this is a refreshing change.  Zamiar is a very capable instructor.  I would rate this DVD beginner-intermediate.  As a beginner Pilates person I could do almost all the moves.  Fun to do.",1082592000,9,239,5.051282051282051
1957276,4,B0000W5J3Q,"I'm 20 years old and consider myself to be at a med/high fitness level with a good balance, so I was hoping this DVD would give me a great workout that was very challenging, so I was very disappointed at first. Instead I would consider the standing portion to be a moderate workout, I was certainly sweating by the end, but there was a never a point where my muscles were seriously challenged. Don't get me wrong I felt a lot of the moves, but not intensely or for very long periods. This will be a workout I will use on days when I'm not feeling so energetic. I was also expecting there to be more ballet like movements where I could feel graceful and pretty like a ballerina :-), instead I just felt like I was exercising, but it was still fun. If you're looking for a more intense workout that is more ballet/graceful like, I would recommend ""Element: Ballet Conditioning."" So after the initial disappointment, I decided to give it another try, and realized that it isn't such a bad workout for what it is. The floor portion I found to be an excellent addition to my pilates collection. It presents some different pilates exercises that I haven't seen before which was refreshing. It wasn't super hard but it definitely gave me a decent challenge.",1204848000,,1250,4.511013215859031
1957277,4,B0000W5J3Q,"Rebecca wrote a great review. I tried this since I loved Katalin in her ""The Method - Meditation Through Movement"" video which I wrote a review for saying she has incredible form & presence, but the pace was a bit slow & too easy for me. She has great body awareness & calm, natural demeanor. I bought her old VHS G.I. Jabb martial arts videos because of her incredible energy/form in it that I saw on her site katalinusa com.

This video's menu only gives the options of the 2 chapter choices of the standing/balance leg work of 30 min & her mat work of 15 min, along with only a quick text bio of Katalin's extensive martial arts accomplishments & other fitness extensive training. The choice of not being able to do w/o the music is a poor choice since the music was so light w/a slow tempo, it put me to sleep. When my heater fan kicked in drowning it out, I enjoyed the workout much more.

Floor work - 30 min - was straight ballet with some lunges, plies, curtsy style drops. She puts it into combos like leg circles, lunge, leg lift forward, backward then down. It's all about balance & ability to stand on one leg. Though I loved that help with grace, I found it repetitive.
Mat work - 15 min - almost no crunches, some leg lifts & drops, a hundred was done, but in sets of 4 pulses then rest, then 4 pulses... the yoga bridge was done very quickly, then a lot of side lying w/more ballet style leg toning.

While I bought this because it wasn't straight pilates & enjoyed the ballet movements, I found the pace to be a bit slow & too easy for me. She allows rests in between & modifies things such as the hundred. I did feel my muscles work for toning, but I already have incredible balance from years of yoga. I did not do it as gracefully as they did, but on a first try, I was close. This is because of Katalin's awesome cuing & reminders of good posture/alignment. She also puts great emphasis on when to inhale/exhale which was great. She also tries to cue YOUR left & right.
This video is for beginners, those with limited balance ability, or those who are die hard ballet fans. This can also be used for toning for a lazy day for those who work out regularly. I will thank Katalin, because by following her cues, I did feel more comfortable, relaxed, & really did the moves more correctly then I do on regular ballet dvd workouts.

If you like this style, I would recommend ""New York City Ballet"" which is better for intermediates with good balance. If you're looking for something that will whip your butt that's a blend of ballet, pilates, dance, balance, I'd suggest Kari Anderson's ""Angles, lines & curves""  I or II & her ""Reach""

1957278,2,B0000W5J3Q,"I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD. I like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser.  I did it once, didn't sweat and was BORED!  It has been gathering dust ever since.",1157241600,,227,4.255813953488372
1957279,5,B0000W5J3Q,"I recently picked this DVD up because I was looking for some variety in my Daily Pilates/Yoga Practice. I've been doing Yoga daily for well over 9 years and started doing Pilates every day before my Yoga practice in the Fall of 2005. I'm totally hooked on Pilates now, the results have been unbelieveable.

 I have many Pilates Programs that do the more ""classic"" Pilates mat work (Stott, Kries (Precision Toning), Burnett, Caban) and many that are variations on the pilates system (New Method, Caribbean Pilates, Liz Gilles and Quick Fix programs). Recently I had picked up New Method 20/20 Pilates Precision Abs and it had some standing Pilates work. At first I was thinking it wouldn't be for me, but the more I did it the more I realized how beneficial it was in terms of developing balance and coordination as well as working the core differently.

 I thought I'd try this Pilates Standing Blend led by Katalin Rodriguez-Zamiar to get more standing work and I wasn't dissapointed!

 The first session which is about 30 minutes long has a variety of standing exercises that are very ballet-like in nature. They are relatively slow and controlled movements which start simpler and build to more complex combinations. The combinations were not so complex that they were really difficult to follow. I'm a 6 ft 2 inch 46 year old male w/zero dance background and I'm not the most graceful person in the world, yet I was able to catch on almost immediately to almost all the moves without too much trouble. Usually by the second or third repetition of a movement I was getting pretty comfortable and this was my first time doing this program.

 I thought Ms Zamiar did a great job of explaining and demonstrating the movements and moved at a pace which was enough to create heat without moving so fast that it was impossible to follow. There were two students who also did the program with her so you could see how other people with different bodies and abilities might do the movements.

 I must admit that I was sweating like crazy by the end of the Standing section and felt like I was very well exercised.

 The second section, which I actually did yesterday for the first time, is a series of floor work. I really enjoyed this also because it was different than the traditional Pilates side lying series (which I enjoy also, but have on many programs already). It's only about 15 minutes long and challenged me in new and interesting ways.

 This program doesn't have any of the Pilates Mat Stomach Series  (which I knew from reading other reviews) so what I did was a short intermediate series (8 minutes long) from Karen Garcia's Pilates complete DVD in order to first warm up my core and then proceeded on to the Standing Blend DVD.

 I can definitely say I'm glad I purchased this because it adds the variety I need to my daily exercise program and I can see it getting featured frequently in my DVD/VHS rotation.

 Highly recommended!",1150070400,14,2943,4.6686046511627906
1957280,5,B0000W5J3Q,I had never tried pilates before and sampled this workout on cable on-demand first.  I have been doing the video average five times per week for four months and have lost over 20 pounds and two sizes.  I still find the video challenging and am amazed at how it is transforming my body (especially hips which are quickly disappearing!).,1145404800,8,335,4.661016949152542
1957281,1,B0000W5J3Q,"I bought this because I was taking a certification class in Standing Pilates.  With a couple of exceptions, the exercises don't bear much resemblance to anything I learned in class.  Mostly, they are more like ballet, which is fine -- but don't call it ""Pilates.""  There is also a section of matwork that I thought might be okay for people who already know what they are doing, but there is not enough instruction for newcomers to perform the exercises correctly. In short, there are better DVDs out there.",1123718400,13,506,4.7272727272727275
1957282,3,B0000W5J3Q,"I bought this video because it promised a serious blend of ballet, pilates etc taught by a martial arts black belt.  What I got instead was a beach front ""workout"" (not much of one however) taught by an obviously fit and attractive young woman in a bikini (sort of) with two helpers and a squeeky voice. This could have been on early morning TV interspersed with corny ads for junky exercise equipment.

Not a serious workout for serious people, but the scenery is pretty good if you just want to watch it while having a beer. Leave the sound off however.",1123113600,4,555,4.485148514851486
1957283,2,B0000W5J3Q,"This workout focuses on legs, legs, legs.  The mat work is so basic that it's hard to recognize the Pilates basis, and the ab workout is nearly absent.  The balance exercises are ok, but very repetitive.  I have numerous pilates DVD's, and this is the first one I wish I could return.",1110758400,8,284,4.423076923076923
1957284,3,B0000W5J3Q,If you are looking for an advanced pilates workout this is not it.  The video and instructor are nice and if you are just starting an exercise routine then this could be a great video for you.  If you are looking for an advanced workout you will not find it here.  I barely broke a sweat and found it too basic a program for my taste.,1105228800,7,334,4.03030303030303
8003995,4,B0000W5J3Q,"I have issues lying on my back on a mat but wanted the benefits of Pilates. This DVD seemed to be a good one and it is. However, the instructor is really fast paced so you have to pay strict attention and push yourself to get all the moves in. There are lots of leg exercises that I can feel from calf to thigh. You do need a chair or something to balance yourself with but otherwise, no equipment is needed.

There are two modifiers in the back, one who does an easier version of the moves and one who does a more challenging version. I just watch the main instructor. At the end is a 10 minute mat routine which I actually did a few times. It didn't bother my back as I expected and was really challenging. If you are very inflexible or have a real hard time with balance, this DVD may be a bit too tough. Otherwise, it's a great way to tone the legs and core without getting down on the floor. Watch it first so you know what's coming because there is no time to observe when you're actually doing the workout. I like it a lot.",1410739200,,1030,4.073891625615763

8003997,5,B0000W5J3Q,"Many other workouts that claim to be standing pilates are just standing workouts, but don't really incorporate pilates principles and neglect the core. This one is very good. Helps improve your balance and teaches you to use your core to improve balance. Challenging, but not so much so that you get discouraged. I recommend watching the workout all the way through first so that you understand the moves better before starting the workout.",1387238400,,440,5.041095890410959
8003998,3,B0000W5J3Q,"I felt that the quality of the program on the DVD was not a true standing Pilates program (blended or not), so I was disappointed. Others may have found this great, but I was looking for a standing Pilates workout .",1360886400,,215,4.2682926829268295
8003999,5,B0000W5J3Q,I loved this routine of standing Pilates and ballet movements. It really focuses on your legs! The 30 mins flew by! The floor routine is for abs and legs again and is 15 mins. I loved this routine! Katalin is really professional and keeps it moving at a nice clip and before you know it-you are done!,1333670400,,300,4.280701754385965
8004000,5,B0000W5J3Q,"This is the first standing Pilates (or maybe it's not true ""Pilates,"" but who cares?) workout I've tried and I love it. I was sweating after the first 10 minutes and could really feel my muscles. The key to this kind of workout is the concentration. If you don't concentrate on the small movements you're doing, the workout will not be as effective as it's intended to be.  I'm certainly no expert, but there were a lot of moves I've never seen or tried before, which I really liked. As for the review that said it's missing an abs section, I concentrate on keeping my abs tight throughout like you're supposed to, and for me, the whole darn thing is an abs section!  I highly recommend this DVD.",1312070400,,696,4.4296875
8004001,5,B0000W5J3Q,"This is my favorite workout video! After a couple of workouts, you will immediately see a difference in the shape of your body and overall muscle tone. I do not know how she does it but Katalin Zamiar is a genius! This is also a good substitution for all the former dancers out there who may miss dance class. This video makes me feel like I am in the warm up of my favorite jazz class. It's a great core workout!",1297555200,,413,4.111111111111111
8004002,2,B0000W5J3Q,I couldn't finish this video because it was so boring and basic.  I gave it two starts because it may be useful for someone starting pilates.  I am not advanced but I didn't find it challenging at all.  If you need to work on balance this could be helfpul.,1272067200,,256,4.183673469387755
8004003,3,B0000W5J3Q,"The 30 minute standing work seemed ineffective, but the last 15 minutes of mat exercises felt that with a few more repetitions the exercises would be worth doing. The instructor Katalin Zamiar is in great shape which is inspiring.",1244246400,,230,4.923076923076923
8004004,4,B0000W5J3Q,"This is a good pilates blend workout for folks bored with floor-work only DVDs. The first half-hour is the standing portion and then the workout ends with floor work.

I bought this DVD bcz i trust the Method dvd programs and I wanted to feel like I was incorporating more ""cardio"" with pilates moves. Doing these movements while standing gave me this experience versus those cardio/pilates workouts that have the viewer doing floor work and then make them pause the DVD to put on gymshoes to do the cardio portion.
Those videos make the workout feel broken up, atleast thats my opinion.
Now, if a person wants to a cardio/pilates workout without switching between DVD's then those cardio/pilates compilation DVDs are useful.

I recommend this work DVD as a happy-medium.",1228176000,,771,4.923076923076923
