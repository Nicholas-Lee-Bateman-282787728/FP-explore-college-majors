7155749,4,B00X3DC6OE,"I would've given this 5 stars if not for the annoying ending. The plot was interesting and both Kidman and Fiennes were awesome in their respective roles. I think maybe the director was trying to get the audience to feel the doubt and agony Kidman's character was feeling, but I would've appreciated a definite ending. It was frustrating to invest time and money in an unfinished story.",1436572800,6,386,4.776119402985074
7155750,4,B00X3DC6OE,"Sorry, I couldn't resist. In Strangerland, Kidman's kids disappear, but the culprit probably wasn't a dingo (although this cannot be completely ruled out). The story is about family, faade, and the inhospitable outback of New South Wales. It centers around Kidman's 15-yr-old daughter Lily, a girl who (to put it politely) is enthusiastic about the opposite sex; the audience is asked to puzzle out the why, where, and how. The uncertainty at the heart of Strangerland drives the tension, with mom and dad getting more than a little bit edgy. Psychological thriller? I say yes, but many will not agree.

PROs
 Nicole Kidman: you get plenty of high-quality Nicole here, so if you appreciate this particular actress, you'll be on cloud 9 (maybe even 10). The story is as much about her character as it is about the missing Lily (portrayed by the heretofore unknown Maddison Brown, who may remain unknown despite the star power of Kidman and Weaving putting her in the spotlight).
 Mostly strong supporting actors, esp. the fella who plays Bertie.
 Cinematography: great job by first-time (for a feature film) director Kim Farrant. She conveyed both the beauty and the peril of rugged New South Wales terrain.

CONs
 Sluggish pace will bore most non-indiefilmgoers (more broadly: most Americans).

Final thoughts: This review may be biased because of the cinematic love affair I've been having with Kidman since 1989 when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Calm/dp/B000I3QU9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Calm</a>&nbsp;(her breakout role) appeared on the silver screen.

7155751,2,B00X3DC6OE,"What's it about?

When two teenage children vanish into the outback, their parents already troubled marriage unravels further.

What did I think?

This home-grown drama doesnt quite know what it wants to be. Psychological drama? Whodunit? Neither? Parents Nicole Kidman and Joseph Finnes go for gritty, but look disconcertingly groomed and shiny for residents of an outback town (new arrivals, its true  but new arrivals from ANOTHER outback town). Nicoles performance is surprisingly good for a while but ends up veering into familiar melodrama, while local cop Hugo Weaving is as solid as ever. The beautifully shot film is obviously trying for a sense of mysterious uncertainty, but its one thing to leave questions unanswered and another to leave them frustratingly ignored.",1434585600,31,778,5.352459016393443

7155817,3,B00X3DC6OE,"This little film is one that we hope will be moving and that involves us in a personal story of life in the outback. Written by Michael Kinirons and Fiona Seres and directed by Kim Farrant the film just never lifts out of the dust despite the presence of some very fine actors who seem uncommitted to the project.

The story concerns Newcomers to the remote Australian desert town of Nathgari, Catherine (Nicole Kidman) and Matthew (Joseph Fiennes) Parker's lives are flung into crisis when they discover their two teenage kids, Tommy (Nicholas Manilton) and Lily (Maddison Brown), have mysteriously disappeared just before a massive dust storm hits. With Nathgari eerily smothered in red dust and darkness, the townsfolk join the search led by local cop, David Rae (Hugo Weaving). It soon becomes apparent that something terrible may have happened to Tommy and Lily. Suspicions run riot, rumors spread and public opinion turns savagely against the Parkers. With temperatures rising and the chances of survival plummeting with each passing day, Catherine and Matthew find themselves pushed to the brink as they struggle to survive the mystery of their children's fate.

Even the cinematography by P.J. Dillon and the musical score by Keefus Ciancia cant salvage this loosely associated, bumpy ride through scenes that after about thirty minutes have lost our concern. Grady Harp, May 16",1463961600,,1386,5.155555555555556

Kim Farrants drama (her debut feature) unfolds like a mystery at first, but like Picnic at Hanging Rock the focus is less on the solution than on the effects of the incident.

The idea is all fine, but the way it is executed needs improvement. After the promising introduction with beautiful photography of deserted landscape, Strangerland attempts to delve into the psychological aspects of the characters including Hugo Weavings police detective, but they often act in a too melodramatic way, ignoring the simplest things, like, if you beat up someone, you usually get caught by the police.

Of course, there are some subtexts beneath the main story of mystery, subtexts about, say, repressed sexuality, but with this messy storyline and incredible (and uninteresting) characters, the film runs out of gas in the mid-section even though it has intense acting from Kidman.",1457222400,,1155,5.160427807486631

Take this movie and make it better, would be a great assignment for a film class because the material has a lot of powerful potential and there are many ways it could be played out better. Sometimes a bad example of material that could be great makes us aware of what makes successful art.

What makes this movie not work?  It lacks the strong controlling hand of an artist.  The actors were good at what they do, but someone in control of the whole movie was absent, even a central viewpoint character would have helped.

For example, did a ""committee"" insist on certain elements to sell the film for the masses? Adding junk to a recipe can ruin it, like the scene between Murtie(?) (the aborigine) and Catherine, that could be interesting if handled discreetly but instead was handled as sex to pander to an audience and distracted from the seriousness of the movie.

Acting is solid if unspectacular, plotting and pacing were just ok for what's basically a ""down under whodunnit"".  Kidman, Weaving and Fiennes are borderline sympathetic characters, although the contrived teenagers' ""walkabout/kidnapping"" and the reaction thereto isn't handled believably.

7155889,4,B00X3DC6OE,"Glancing at the reviews on 'Imdb' i feel this well-crafted movie has been somewhat under-rated.
'Catherine' (Nicole Kidman) and husband 'Matthew Parker' along with their children 'Lily' (Maddison Brown) and
'Tommy' (Nicholas Hamilton) live in a back-water town these days on the edge of the 'Australian' outback.
They are a pretty dysfunctional family, 'Catherine' and 'Matthew' barely get along these days and sleep separately,
15-year old 'Lily' is out-of-control and has built up quite a reputation among the local-lads of the small town, the
problems within the household have rubbed off on younger sibling 'Tommy' he often goes for a walk-about at night.
When a ferocious dust-storm hits town, both 'Lily' and 'Tommy' had earlier seemingly run-off together, there is no
trace of their whereabouts, local Sheriff 'David Rae' (Hugo Weaving ) organises a search in the surrounding out-back
knowing that in the searing heat the two siblings can survive but a few days.
Desperation quickly overwhelms 'Catherine' and 'Matthew' their personal difficulties become even more evident, as
time appears to be running out it becomes an emotion-charged search......will the two be found alive ???
This Australian made movie has been well crafted, many actors among the cast emerge with credit for their roles in
the film, 'Nicole Kidman' in particular is superb.
Well worth a viewing..........

7155913,2,B00X3DC6OE,"Basically with any missing kids movie one two things happened, the kid has run away to what is, even in reality or perception, a better, safer, perhaps more exciting life and never plans to return or let anyone know where it went so the life it ran away from can't catch up to it. Or something bad happened to the kid, such as it was abducted, murdered or simply got lost and perished due to not having the skills to find it's way home and survive in the harsh realities of nature.  So when you buy a movie about missing kids, you're kind of expecting a number of clues in the story line along the way for you to guess what happened and by the end of the film you're either proven wrong or right, but either way you know.  With the case of a small town outback town like this, everyone of course is a suspect.

The problem with Strangerland though is that every single character in the film throughout either prior to the disappearance or after is given a possible motive, be it that they are into sleeping with underage girls, or they are the parent of one covering it up. Perhaps it's a gypsy curse style vengeance thing for nearly careless driving running down an old aboriginal elder in a 4WD either through some indigenous rainbow serpent type thing or a simple murder and blame it on the legend. Even the small town cop could have done or had worked out who did and was covering up for them if not himself since he determined where the SAS volunteers searched and if he ever contacted Telstra to find out who was calling the parent's house, he never revealed who it was. Plus the sheer number of those volunteers for such a small town meant there was a fairly sizable one near enough for those people to come from that would also have trucks and other suppliers coming and going in the area resulting in it a complete stranger we never see. Either of the parents of course could been responsible either through abuse or something as a motive for one or both of the children running away (with the other following in the night either known or unknown to the other), or simply as a killer.  Perhaps one of them was even keeping the kid locked away somewhere else in an old mine or something they'd stumbled across since they both drove around a lot.

The point is no questions are ever answered, sure there's the suggestion that there was a car at one point but that source could very well have been making that up just to stop being hassled, or either to cover up their own guilt, or show the person who did the crime that they won't be telling what really happened.  Or perhaps it was the simple case of a run away who caught a lift with a trucker and is now in a big city somewhere.  That's the problem, we the viewer are left to our own assumptions.",1444089600,,2757,4.3313953488372094

7155915,2,B00X3DC6OE,"I gave it a two, because I really can't say that I ""liked"" the plot. Basically, it was about a totally dysfunctional family moving to a sparsely populated area in the Australian outback. Not only is the family constantly miserable, but apparently almost the whole town is surly and unfriendly. It is definitely a place you would not like to live in. The kids go missing (one nice little normal boy and a boy crazy teenage girl). As the search continues, Nicole Kidman flips out under pressure and turns into a sex machine trying to bed every male within reach while the husband appears as unfeeling with as much personality as a potato (it was his role, not the actors fault).

I can't call it a psychological thriller, since most of the psychology is based on the characters mental flaws which really appear to go no deeper than the act of sex and control. I wouldn't call it an adventure or survival movie either since most of the film revolved around personal conflict.

On the good side, the photography was excellent and the acting was fantastic. Some people may enjoy the film.  However, I did not.  If I had liked the story I would have rated it higher.",1443484800,2,1160,4.5625

Good Lord, people, it is Clearly an art film. Not an American shoot 'em up detective show.
The cinematography in the Australian Outback are stunning.
There is a recurring theme of the Rainbow Serpent: a tattoo, a scar on an Aboriginal man's head, and a part of the scenery--hills going off into the distance. There is a dead snake in the desert which frightens Kidman (Mrs. Parker). A little Aboriginal boy talks of the Rainbow Serpent after two children go missing. In Aboriginal mythology, the Rainbow Serpent is (amongst other things) a punisher of law-breakers. But it is also a fertility god, creator & other things including a monster that eats children.
The mother of the missing children (Nicole Kidman as Catherine Parker) is baffled by this reference to a Rainbow Serpent but later goes looking for the old Aboriginal woman whom she (Kidman) nearly ran down when she was driving around, searching for the kids. At one point, Mrs. Parker/Kidman does go into the desert, desperately trying to connect with her daughter. She returns to town, naked & temporarily insane. This is such strong acting, it is difficult to watch. You really feel her torture.
I've seen other Australian films with an old woman character nearly run down, so it must be part of a myth I've never read. But I do know enough anthropology to realize she is a symbol for the Earth Mother & Nicole in her big SUV represents modern woman, not linked to Nature/the Land.
Nicole & Jospeh Fiennes play the Parkers, whose children disappear. Their daughter is wildly sexual at age 15. I won't do spoilers but there is a backstory there, which caused them to leave their former home & move to this ""wild west"" outback town.
the Parkers do not communicate well. Nicole's character seems to mainly lie in bed, dreaming & wanting sex with her husband. She has been clueless that her children are not attending their new school until the day she realizes they have disappeared.
Mr. Parker (Fiennes, brilliant)  is frantic, trying to do his job as a pharmacist & repair all the damage done in their former town. His facade is cracking, he seems on the verge of tears but also violence, anger dealing with anyone who has had illicit contact with his daughter.
The daughter (Lily/Maddison Brown) has created a diary which is collage, poetry, scribbles. It's her voice that narrates, with poetic lines at the beginning & end of the film. Her voice is haunting, lost.
My father spent some time in Australia. Dad mapped Antarctica but was trained in NZ & Australia. He came back wanting to move to either place. We kids desperately wanted to go but Mom put her foot down. Dad did tell you ""that land could swallow you up & no one would ever find you."" (like the dust storm in this film.) So I've always been fascinated with Australia, the danger of the land. I live in Colorado & have also lived all over the American West, which has similar features--especially Utah, NM & AZ. The dry, uninhabited, red rock terrain is hypnotizing.
It's almost as if the land wanted Lily (the teenaged Parker daughter) as a wife. She is desperate for mens' attentions (as is her mother).
The Sheriff (Hugo Weaving) does a fantastic job of trying to balance his duties to find the children but also to protect his ""people,"" the Aboriginal & other citizens of the area.
All the actors do brilliant work, Oscar or Golden Globe worthy. The cinematography is genius.
The ending left me wishing for a more definitive answer to the mystery. But this is an art film, not a whodunit. We are left wondering who Lily is referring to when she says ""touch me in the dark, no one can see.""",1441324800,15,3705,4.665137614678899

To say the family featured in STRANGERLAND is dysfunctional would be an understatement. This new drama starring Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes will surely disturb most and present all with a story that will frighten but not in a jump-in-your-face way. If nothing else it will start conversation with those who watch and go out for coffee after.

The location is a desert town in Australia, a beautiful scenic area of stone and sand that offers a home to what appear to be drifters and those getting by. Tossed into this town is the Parker family, recently relocating there for reasons unknown until later on. None of the four family members are happy to be here and some are more vocal about it than the rest.

Father Matthew (Fiennes) is a pharmacist who seems to have trouble relating to anyone in the house, in particular his wife Catherine (Kidman), a woman who still feels that emotional and physical need for her husband but whose affections go unfulfilled. Their oldest child, daughter Lily (Maddison Brown) is the rebellious child, a young girl turned 15 who seeks the attentions of any and all males she encounters, something that will lead this family down a torturous path. Lastly there is Tommy (Nicholas Hamilton), a young boy who is torn by the problems his family faces and who deals with it be sneaking out and walking the streets and nearby area in the dark of night.

The movie opens by exposing these problems to us but never explaining just what it was that happened to bring these four people to this point. All we know for sure is that Lily offers what most would call tramp like behavior, sleeping with boys her age and older. Is this a response to their moving, is it because of something at home or is it just an act of teenage angst? Before the end of the film all possibilities will be pursued.

It comes to a head when Catherine discovers one day that both children have not gone to school and have disappeared. With a major sand storm on the way, she contacts Matthew and they go to report them missing only to find themselves in the midst of the storm as they reach the center of town. When the storm blows over they report the missing children to the local police Chief David Rae (Hugo Weaving). Concerned but not overly so, he lets them know the children must be missing for 24 hours before a search is called for but begins on his own.

As the movie progresses the bits and pieces weve been left to wonder about are slowly revealed, the problems that laid beneath the surface of this family that they were dealing with, each in their own way but never together. Tossed into the mix is the problems faced by Chief Rae, personal with the woman hes sleeping with whose brother may be a suspect in the disappearance and his attraction to the attractive Catherine. With each passing day as the children aren't found, suspicions and accusations will fly, past wounds that had scabbed over will be opened wide and the mental anguish of all involved will take center stage.

This movie is not your normal fast paced detective drama that one would inspect. With the location being a small town in the middle of wide open spaces it doesnt have that quick cut megacity feel to it. Instead were presented with a small town where most everyone feels they know everyone elses business but at the same time don't have a clue what is going on. People try to help by joining the search, refuse to believe anyone they know could have done harm to the children and all look with glaring eyes at the couple whose children have gone and they feel may be responsible.

Kidman does a great job here, as both a tormented mother concerned for her children and as a woman who loves and longs for a husband who is in retreat for some reason. Fiennes comes off as a combination of unlikeable and sympathetic at the same time. Weaving takes on a commanding presence in the midst of it all while at the same time showing a vulnerable side that makes him wonder till the very end just what happened.

As I said, this movie is not fast paced but not so deadly slow as to be boring. On the contrary each moment on screen doesnt feel wasted. It all combines to make a taught thriller that keeps you wondering just what will happen next and with whom. It could be that the children hitched a ride, got lost in the desert or met with were the victims of foul play and the movie has you guessing with each scene. In the end it makes for a film that will hold our attention and consider the lives of the Parker family. Entertaining isn't quite the word to describe the film but it will end with you thinking long after the final credits role.",1440547200,2,4695,4.475467289719626

7155973,4,B00X3DC6OE,"This film is visually striking and you can almost feel the stinging desert heat on your skin and the heavy weight of the sun blazing in your eyes during some scenes. Nicole Kidman is superb, she expresses her agony so realistically it truly seemed to be her actual real life experience. I don't know how she was able to capture the broken, raw, and disturbing emotions that her character expressed during the ordeal. It ws hard to watch at times because it was so intense and almost to realistic for someone who is as sensitive as I am especially about child abduction. The movie is very sad, you will feel heartache and pain while watching it because it is so well acted and it touches on a terrible thing that happens everyday, all over the world to children and families everywhere. What makes it hard to watch is the fact that no one is entirely safe from a possible abduction and it makes you think too much. I appreciated, the raw, gut wrenching and brutal way the story unfolded because it was a true example of how easy something like a child abduction can happen and how even the most involved, aware and safety cautious parents can still lose a child to a stranger. This was not so,ething that could of been prevented by the family or anyone. There were times I thought that I should turn it off because I didn't want to know the final outcome. I liked the characters too much and I wanted the family to have their suffering end. But, I kept it on because the acting was phenomenal and it told a realistic story with the harsh reality that he family had to go through. If you want to watch an upbeat movie don't watch this. It is deeply sad and I was brawling at the end. Yet I loved the beautiful way it ended and I am glad I watched it. Nicole Kidman did some of her best work in this film.",1439337600,,1802,4.31858407079646
7155974,4,B00X3DC6OE,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot)com says: Dark dramas can be emotionally disturbing, an ebb and flow of emotional pull and crashing honesty. It must be careful not to bend towards schmaltz or surrealism; the more invested we are as viewers, the stronger the emotional zenith. The caveat for Strangerland is it is not for all. As wonderful a drama as it is. Truth is often hard. Plus, younger audience members will not have had life-experience to grasp the gritty honesty shown. Think Eugene ONeill. An admirer of Long Days Journey or Moon for the Misbegotten will adore these emotional workings; its riptide undercurrent and unfinished tableaus.

In plain English? Its wicked dramatic and the teens are not the stars, the grown ups and their keep-from-the-kids emotions are.

Amazing terrible truths are churned upon the screen until your whole being is glued. You are witness to a small family cracking, breaking, imploding, snapping violently and then fold in towards repair.

All this cataclysmic inter-family brouhaha is unfolding in a tiny Australian desert town people kind of made happen  in the way we do. The surrounding land seems none too keen on the intrusion, and feels free to pluck townsfolk away, vanished, at randomor so the local myths go.

And, new to this area is the Parker family (Nicole Kidman, Joseph Fiennes, Madison Brown, and Nicholas Hamilton). From frame one, you understand, things are a pinch off  but what. Oddly, the son walks all night as he can not sleep, and the daughter is a tad over-sexual at a minor age of 15. In fact, this demotion of the family to the strangerlands, is due to her recent covert meanderings with her much older sleazstack-ish teacher. The tension left in the affairs wake is as taut as any aerial acts wires.

Lillie (Madison Brown) is a languishing Lolita. Though, boys her age are fair game too. Shes very unhappy here. So is her kid brother

The evening after a very metaphoric dust storm hits, igniting the emotional fury ahead, both children are no where to be found. And, as this place borders a literal desert, parental panic ensues. The police sort of get on, but the familys past threatens to swallow them all over again. Where are these kids?

The cast is superb. Joseph Fiennes, here Mr. Parker, is akin to a well-aired Justin Isosceles 2010 red. He is a cut of grass-fed grade A mansteak. Course, thats just part of his genealogy; Ralph, his elder brother, is aging like a fine Giuseppe Quintarelli amarone. Yet, while yes the Fiennes mens beauty is well thrown about to idle time man-gawking in some circles, the talent of the whole Fiennes clan never ceases to strike awe.

Then theres Mrs. Parker, aka The Goddess of Alabaster, Nicole Kidman. This lady is one helluva talent. The story is not easy and the needs of the script hard. Yet even as she chips apart emotionally before your very eyes, the performance reads as true as taxes and as visceral as a meadow of fresh air-dried linens.

Hugo Weaving shows as the local sheriff and as always bubbles beneath. Hugo is a huge part of the films realism; hes a nice guy, thrown into really rough situations with varying levels of delicacy needed to keep the balls-in-the-air. Naturally, hes like a professional juggler.

Enjoy  but do so knowing this is no fluffy summer tickle-your senses movie. Strangerland is high drama that needs time to work in.",1439251200,2,3377,4.8117443868739205

Search parties diligently comb the outback for the boy and girl. The rest is up to you to decide if you want to watch this movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1438732800,6,612,4.473214285714286
7155977,3,B00X3DC6OE,"Superb performances and breathtaking cinematography enhance STRANGERLAND, a film that poses many more questions than it answers.  Indeed, at the end of its 111 minute running time, an audience has got to be wondering What just happened?

Married couple Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes have just moved with their two teenage children to a remote town in the Australian outback.  We sense that there is a lot of dysfunction going on in this family.  The parents don't share the same bed, their fifteen-year-old daughter seems to be the town tramp and the younger son goes out alone at night, walking in the desert.

One day, the two teens vanish in a dust storm.  Was foul play involved?  Or, did the kids fall prey to the mysterious, unforgiving Australian wilderness?

While Kidman and Fiennes are suffering their own personal breakdowns over the disappearance of their children, the local sheriff (Hugo Weaving) begins a massive search in the withering desert, while taking care to protect certain townsfolk with whom he is close.

STRANGERLAND is, at times, an engrossing mystery, yet it is also a bit overlong and ambiguous for this writers personal taste.  Kidman, Fiennes, Weaving and the supporting cast do not disappoint.

Kim Farrant directed the screenplay by Fiona Seres and Michael Kinrons.

The Blu-ray disc from Alchemy contains two Behind the Scenes featurettes.

When Catherine wakes up one morning to find her two children are missing her world is rocked. They feel the police are not doing enough and take it upon themselves to look for them. When past history is revealed no one can be trusted. This is a very difficult movie to watch. The acting by Kidman is Oscar worthy and everyone else does hold their own against her. On the other hand the subject is gut wrenching and the movie is a little slow moving. It does keep you watching and interested though, both to see the end and for Kidmans performance. This is a good movie but nothing you can watch over and over and also one you really have to be in the mood for. Worth seeing for her acting if for no other reason.

Beginning to end, it's impossible to tell which one STRANGERLAND is, and that's one more great thing about this new film from Down Under. So for those looking for grindhouse horror or oddball family drama, be warned: neither one of those genres is actually represented here. This is very much an adult film; but those with out-of-control kids should probably make their kids watch it.

The wild, however we approach its wonder and beauty, always carries a thorn, a poison stinger hidden in the beautiful landscape. The Australian Outback shown here is one of those most unforgiving landscapes. Thanks to great cinematography and really superb direction, you will get a good, breathless slice of Nature's Reality Show here, both in the vast reaches of the Outback and in the depths of human nature. And speaking of naturalness, it's here for the first time, you can see both great actors --Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving-- actually looking their age.

The fallout from one family's move to the deep Australian Outback from a metro center is spooky-beautiful to watch, slow to start, and stays deep. Layers keep unfolding. That indigenous Aboriginal wisdom ways were not the focal point or much of a back story disappointed me at first; but there were  understated markers along the way, including a very young child's mention of The Rainbow Serpent.

Maybe the real mystery at work here  is how many parents fail their kids, and the terrifying ripple effect that is the cost of careless parenting. One thing's for sure: no stone is left unturned in this scary, unflinching look at a family tangled up in one of the worst kinds of tragedy.

The combination of permissive *anything goes* parenting and what can happen to the sexually precocious kid and everyone around them without close parenting, is shown here to be fertile ground indeed, for Bad Things. In one shocking scene, the stay-at-home mom actually tries to blame the school for her kids' failure to attend.",1437955200,15,2026,4.961651917404129

8714836,3,B00X3DC6OE,"Set in the Australian outback, Strangerland tells the story of a family that has recently relocated to a small town that is literally in the middle of nowhere. The move seemed like an odd choice, but as you will later find out, it was a necessary one, but needless to say no one is particularly happy about it, especially the families two kids. One day there is a report of a large dust storm headed towards town and the parents go to get their children to safety, only to discover they are nowhere to be found. The local sheriff is called in, but he's not moving fast enough for the father, so he takes things into his own hands, further complicating things. Aside from the unusual setting and circumstances of the disappearance, this film isn't all that original, in fact, except for the ending and the location, it was really very similar to the film, Prisoners. The investigation was fairly interesting, as was the setting, Hugo Weaving was good as the sheriff, but was really the only interesting character with any kind of personality or background of interest. As for the rest of the cast, they're kind of just there, they don't talk much about themselves or their past and the film has an extremely narrow focus. Nicole Kidman just cries a lot and Joseph Fiennes wants to yell at anyone who will listen, which unfortunately is us. The bottom line, Strangerland is an average, forgettable film, it has enough going for it that it will keep your attention and it moves at a decent pace, but the characters are nothing to write home about, the performances are nothing special either, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand what's going on or what happened in the end.",1479081600,,1692,4.6245847176079735
