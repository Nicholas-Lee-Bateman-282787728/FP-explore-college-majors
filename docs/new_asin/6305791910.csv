Not only does it cover the Scottish military history of the bagpipe it also covers other countries military history with the pipes.
I found the best part of the DVD to be an interview between Prince Charles of England and the last surviving piper from World War One.
A very informative and entertaining DVD.",1412380800,,457,4.325581395348837
7895987,5,6305791910,"When I saw this movie, I remember several chapter of my country history.  In venezuela history we have so much respect for our british legion.  This Legion was formed by several English, Irish and Scottish men, they  fought shoulder with shoulder with our grand-grandfathers.  I remember  that Carabobo's battle (21-Jul-1823) was saved by sacrifice of the brittish  legion.
If see this movie and imagine this facts, you're in Venezuela  during our Independence war, specifically Carabobo battle: ""When the  spanish front line march against our lines, this was terrible, our cavalry  under General Paez command was crashed, we lost a lot of people including a  men nicknamed ""Negro primero"", the first black men to reach in  out country the rank of lieutenant in battle, and the brittish legion  commanded by Col. Thomas Ferriar goes to rescue General Paez, they stand up  facing from spanish cavalry, it`s one of our most great historical facts,  the british legion don't use bullets against spanish, they used his bodies,  his first and second line only fix bayonets and march against them, this  was a stop signal for the spanish cavalry and infantry, in this moment  Bolvar sent to the battle 2nd and 3rd Divisions commanded by Plaza and  Cedeo.  And inspired by the brittish sacrifice Rondn (Reserve Divison)  said ""Rondn an no ha peleado"" and he goes against spanish and  finally we won this battle and our freedom"".
The final battle of our  freedom was in 24-Jul-1823 in the Maracaibo Lake, it was based on a plan by  the Brittish Mathematician Cramer (the same of rule for solve squeared  matrix), too similar with the legion strategy in Carabobo but in a closed  gulf, they attack three casttles (San carlo, San Fernando and Zapara) in  the navigation channel of Maracaibo, we know this like ""Forzamiento de  la Barra de Maracaibo"".  The brittish presence in our history  start with the presence of General Francisco de Miranda in French, England  and United Stated, by this fact several English, Irish and Scottish men  goes to Venezuela.  One of this mens was Gregor McGregor, when he arrives  to Venezuela his troop was kilted mens.  It's was too much weird, but his  fierce in battle won our respect and a special place in our mind and our  history books.  By Bolvar's orders McGregor was the chief of Ocumare  people in battle, it was like a proof, and he passed it, because when the  spanish saw scottish and the black people joint in the same unit they think  taht this was Petion's people (Jaimaican soldiers) and don't fight against  them, another important men was an Irish, Daniel F. O'Leary he was the  Bolvar's Edecan (Bolivar's right hand), his presence in our land gave us a  great  account of information because he wrote several books about with our  independence.",966729600,,2789,4.890557939914163
