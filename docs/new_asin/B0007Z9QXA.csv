8054683,4,B0007Z9QXA,"This video provides most of needed information for new breastfeeding Moms.  I love that it contains compared good and bad latch, positioning, sound of baby swallowing and the interactive quiz.  The only thing I wish I'd known before I bought this video is that it is only meant for home use and not as an educational film, which I was hoping to use in my breastfeeding class.  It doesn't state this on the video package, just as the opener copyright statement. :(",1207699200,,463,4.621951219512195

8054686,1,B0007Z9QXA,"I do not recomend this video. It is a cheap production that goes very generally throught the topics of breastfeeding without explaining accuratelly. You can get the same information on a book that will cost you less. If you want a good video look at ""Breastfeeding without tears"".",1133913600,2,280,4.854166666666667
8054687,5,B0007Z9QXA,"I received this DVD as a gift before the birth of my second child.  I had successfully breastfed my first-born for ten months and enjoyed every rewarding minute.  I wasn't concerned about breastfeeding my second child because of the postive experience from the first, but when she arrived, we found ourselves struggling.  Unable to remember the details of breastfeeding from the three years before, I looked to Nature's Way for some help.  I was instantly rewarded.  We began to latch with more ease, and breastfeeding became enjoyable for both of us.

Nature's Way provides both new and experienced moms an in-depth look at breastfeeding.  The positioning and latching segments show the mother and baby from several angles and allow the viewer to hear the sounds of proper nursing.  The DVD also features sections on pumping and nursing discreetly which I found beneficial to my needs.  My husband even watched the DVD with me and was able to offer specific advice and encouragement in subsequent feedings.

This DVD is a must-have for new and experienced mothers, their partners, and encouragers.  We look forward to giving it as a gift to every expecting family we know!",1125014400,6,1173,4.994845360824742
8054688,5,B0007Z9QXA,"As an experienced internationally board certified lactation consultant, I was thrilled to see Nature's Way: Guide to Breastfeeding available for expectant and new parents.  Not only is it full of excellent, accurate information, but the visuals are remarkably helpful to any new mom wanting to breastfeed.  Close ups of positioning and latch-on, sounds of a breastfed baby swallowing and true views of the unique yellowness of breastfed stools are but a few of the very helpful aspects of this excellent DVD.  Hayley Wagner's calming, non-judgemental approach is wonderfully refreshing.  I highly recommend it to all!",1123718400,16,617,5.463157894736842
8054689,5,B0007Z9QXA,"I was so happy when I received this DVD as a gift at my baby shower.  I really wanted to breastfeed and wanted all the information I could get my hands on since this was my first baby.  After watching the DVD I was informed and ready to get started.  My baby and I found immediate success with breastfeeding and I believe it was because of the video.  I was ready to get started, not scared or worried, I was informed and knew the right way from the wrong way, and it all worked out perfectly for baby and I.

I strongly recommend this video to anyone looking for the right information on breastfeeding.  I know you'll appreciate it as well.",1120694400,3,641,4.256198347107438
8054690,5,B0007Z9QXA,"I got this DVD as a gift at my baby shower some months ago and packed it away with all the other gifts.  I never really gave it much thought after that until the subject of breastfeeding came up in discussion with my Mom and some friends.

As this was my first child I was apprehensive about the subject and thought that I'd need help and perhaps take a class.  Then I remembered I had this DVD.  I watched it and was amazed how well it was presented.  All my questions and concerns were answered within minutes of watching it.  I was so pleased because this was even better than attending a class.  I actually got to watch many demonstrations as I learned.  The quiz was great and reinforced the learning process.  The FAQs is another neat feature.

I delivered my baby last month and am now successfully breastfeeding him.  Often as I nurse him I'll watch the DVD to ensure I'm doing everything just right.

From now on this is going to be the number one choice on the baby registry for all future baby showers.  Hayley Wagner has done a magnificent job with this DVD.  Two Thumbs Way Up!!

Thanks

8054691,5,B0007Z9QXA,"First, in the interest of full disclosure, let me say that I have attended Hayley Wagner's brestfeeding classes and consider her a personal friend.  So I was very excited when this DVD came out because I know what an experienced, knowledgeable expert and wonderful teacher she is.  I hope you find enough substantive content in my review to convince you to buy this DVD.

This DVD is perfect for an expecting mother planning to breastfeed.  If you can't attend a class, I think this DVD will offer an ample substitute, but I can't say that from personal experience.  I can say that this is a perfect DVD to have after you've attended the class.  It can be hard to remember some of the finer points from class when you get home with your baby, and this DVD anticipates all the questions you may have when a lactation consultant is not around and you need help.  It's clear that much care was taken to include all the right content in this DVD.

As I said, this DVD is well suited to a mother planning to breastfeed, not necessarily someone trying to decide whether to breastfeed, unless you're curious about the day-today details of breastfeeding.  I could beat you over the head with the mountain of research to convince you to breastfeed, but it's ultimately a personal choice.  This DVD doesn't dwell on that choice either.  It devotes about a minute to the advantages of breastfeeding and then dives right into the instructional content, which is thorough, concise, and excellent.  Since there's no editorial review to give you any details of this DVD, I'll give you a quick list of the content (from [...]

Frequently asked questions

The extraordinary thing about this DVD is the way it presents the information and the detail it gives you.  For example, in addition to explaining how to get your baby to latch correctly, it shows you a baby latching correctly, compares this side-by-side with an incorrectly latched baby, shows techniques for correcting a bad latch, and even gives you the sound of baby feeding with a correct latch versus an incorrect latch - all of this with an actual breastfeeding mother and baby.  This level of detail is given for positioning as well.  Want to know what your baby's stool should look like in the diaper?  What colostrum looks like compared to regular breastmilk?  What the different kinds of breast pumps look like?  What a breast pump looks like in action?  This DVD will show you, in vivid detail!  (When I used a breastpump for the first time, I wondered if I had done it correctly because the rate of pumping into the bottle seemed low.  This DVD would have allayed my concerns.)

Finally, the DVD features are outstanding and the videography is excellent, showing all the right angles at just the right distance to give you the detail you need.  The chapter menu is detailed enough that you can go right to a specific area you need help with.  And the quiz at the end is a great pedagogical tool to help reinforce what you've learned.  If you get an answer right, you get cheesy applause like a goofy educational program, but if you get an answer wrong, the DVD shows you the appropriate snippet from the DVD which gives the correct answer.  I didn't even know DVDs could do that!

In closing, if you want the real thing, get this DVD.  This isn't made by some celebrity who happened to breastfeed her children, this is made by a professional nurse and lactation consultant with over 14 years of experience in teaching breastfeeding, solving real problems, and caring for babies, both her own (she has three) and her clients'.  Hayley has dedicated her life to the care and nursing of babies, and she distills a great deal of her professional wisdom and experience into this DVD for you.  This DVD is a must-have for any new or expecting mother.  Five stars aren't enough!",1118793600,17,4044,4.702279202279202
