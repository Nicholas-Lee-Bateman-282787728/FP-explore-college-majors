7951208,1,B00005QX7R,"It is TOO Bad this tape was not clearly marked that it was a VHS tape. I orderd thinking it was a DVD.
The person that I ordered from did not clearly do this like the other sites that are presenting this. Shame on them and sorry for me having something I CANNOT USE.WHO even has a VHS player anymore!!",1354060800,,301,4.033333333333333

MY WORD, THE HIGH-NOTES THAT BROKE THE HOURGLASS ONCE AGAIN, LIKE ""LOU CHRISTIE'S"" - ""LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN"" , AND THE HIGH NOTES COMING OUT OF OUR ""63-YEAR OLD"" OF ""JAY BLACK"" AND THE ""AMERICANS"", CLASSIC: "" CARA MIA ""... A GREAT MINI-CONCERTO WAS PERFORMED BY: ""Little Anthony & the Imperials"", AND THAT PART OF THE PROGRAM I JUST CATCH MYSELF WATCHING IT OVER & OVER AGAIN(grabe-talaga).. THE ""DUPREES"", CONSISTING OF: ""TOMMY PETILLO"", ""JIMMY SPINELLI"", ""PHIL GRANITO"", AND ""TONY TESTA"", DID AN ASTOUNDING PERFORMANCE WITH THEIR CLASSICS OF: ""YOU BELONG TO ME"", AND ""HAVE YOU HEARD"", SUCH A CHOREOGRAPHY OF THEIR ""FOOTWORK"" AND STEPS, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SHOW..I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM FOR YOU WILL NEVER BE DISAPPOINTED, AND THATS ONE TO WATCH OVER & OVER AGAIN....",1127347200,10,1179,4.9

7951213,4,B00005QX7R,"With ""Doo Wop 50"" over three years ago, PBS and its Pittsburgh affiliate came up with an amazing trip back in popular musical history, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that ""oldies"" music could be something more than sheer nostalgia. The performers, many in their sixties and seventies, rose to the special occasion of performing just a couple of their ""biggies"" in Pittsburgh's grand Benedium Theater and showed that they still had ""the right stuff."" Having given so many of the original R&B and Doo Wop groups their ""day in the sun"" in ""Doo Wop 50"" and ""Doo Wop 51,"" promoter T.J. Lubinsky apparently decided (no doubt with the help of host Jerry Butler) to expand and include more solo acts and more ""pop"" performers in the 2001 line-up. The result is yet another masterpiece, showcasing some of the most memorable performers of forty years ago. Unfortunately the need to edit two full nights of classic hits down to a single show meant that some terrific music had to be cut. Lou Christi only gets to remind us that he ""still has the voice"" on ""Lightning Strikes,"" but word has it that his other performances that same night were just as remarkable. One important omission made in introducing the performers was in stating who is ORIGINAL and who is NOT. The Duprees, despite their extraordinary recreation of three of their biggest hits, are not fronted by Joey Vann (who died in the early 1980s), nor were the Limelights of ""Daddy's Home"" fame fronted by James ""Shep"" Sheppard (also deceased), while the Fleetwoods only seem to have but one original in singer Gary Troxell. Still the legendary reunions, and more important, the ability of these performers to give yet again their full measure make this an extraordinary show worth watching over and over again. Had it been longer and more inclusive, surely my fifth star would have been earned.",1013385600,21,1857,4.80625
7951214,5,B00005QX7R,"Whether you remember them from your youth or just know good music when you here it, you'll love this video. It has all the the greats from the good old days, showing that they still got it after all these years. Every performance in this show is spectacular and it's great seeing all the old singers in action again. Every one from Frankie Valli to The Earls are showcased in this special. Don't miss out on this video, it's one of the finest collection of songs and performers of all time",1007596800,11,489,4.384615384615385
7951215,4,B00005QX7R,I think everyone needs a little lift in their long drawn out days.  Doowop music can do that for you.  These singers just want us all to remember the younger years and still appreciate them.  It's a chance to sit back and listen to some of your old favorite songs.  It brings us all a little nostalgia.,1007424000,7,302,4.245614035087719
