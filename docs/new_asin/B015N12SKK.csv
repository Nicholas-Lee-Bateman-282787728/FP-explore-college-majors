7442720,3,B015N12SKK,"Director Wych Kaos could only improve after releasing the awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tekken-2-Kazuya-s-Revenge/dp/B00KITEHVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge</a>, and while he does just that with Zero Tolerance, hes still not making the movie that most viewers actually want to see. Talk about unmatched expectations! This film  a thriller disguised as an action feature - is probably the best movie that Kaos has ever done, but thats still not saying much.

The story: When the estranged daughter of an ex-CIA operative (Dustin Nguyen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-Vietnam/dp/B00JPFTWQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in Vietnam</a>) turns up dead in Bangkok, he and his ex-partner (Sahajak Boonthanakit,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-God-Forgives/dp/B00E1LNDDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only God Forgives</a>) delve into the citys underworld to uncover the young womans shady past and unmask her killer.

To be fair, I don't think that the movie was ever explicitly advertised as a martial arts feature, but when the names used to promote it include Dustin Nguyen, Scott Adkins, Gary Daniels, and Kane Kosugi, one cannot help but expect a lot of hand-to-hand action. Disappointingly, the film does not even provide the bare minimum. There are two full-length brawls, only one of which counts as an actual karate fight (the Nguyen/Adkins showdown), and neither of them are very good  they could have been shot with anybody, with no need for some of the best onscreen fighters to get involved. The action content in general is meager, with only three shootouts to otherwise tide viewers over. One of these  a close-range affair in a crowded room  is pretty enjoyable, but breathtaking action clearly isn't this films objective.

This is a character-driven thriller, and in that regard, the movie isn't bad. Dustin and his costars all generally excel at playing morally ambiguous characters in a sleazy setting. The movies pacing is infinitely better than the directors previous picture, and though this is not exactly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven/dp/B00011CZRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven</a>, I felt engaged and anxious to find out who the killer was. The eventual resolution is a serious matter of taste  either youll find it ironically apt or a complete cop-out  but it highlights the earthy tone of the movie that may turn off people who are used to lighter fare. The subject of prostitution is questionable enough for some folks, but theres an odd, uncomfortable strain of chauvinism running through the picture, with abuse of women by both good guys and villains being a common occurrence despite the general anti-trafficking sentiment.

Apparently this movie was edited from an unreleased film, with the footage of Adkins and Kosugi shot a couple of years later. Its integrated pretty well  practically unnoticeable unless you know what to look for. This feat of seamlessness is easily the most impressive part of the movie, which otherwise ends up being relatively unremarkable. Zero Tolerance isn't the debacle it could have been, but its also not nearly as cool as Im certain most people were hoping for. Know yourself well before considering anything more than a rental.",1449014400,5,3443,6.034836065573771

7442730,3,B015N12SKK,"Scott Adkins essentially has an extended cameo in this film so having him plastered prominently on promotional materials is deceptive. But if you can move past that, its a moderately entertaining film about a failed father seeking out whoever killed his daughter who was a hooker. Adkins plays her sort of boyfriend. He's good in his few scenes.",1453766400,2,345,4.9655172413793105

8733943,3,B015N12SKK,"Two former paramilitary operatives - Johnny and Pete - search Bangkok to find the killers of Johnny's daughter Angel. But when Angel turns out to be a high-level call girl, Johnny and Peter shoot up everyone and everywhere to find who killed her. This is barely 3 stars, barely, not enough Scott Adkins for me at all, not that the rest of the cast weren't terrific, except for Dustin Nguyen, moody and angry and never showing a bit of emotion. His daughter is dead and he doesn't react except to kill. Does he cry, no. I found his portrayal confusing and ridiculous. I get this is an international film but still emotion is universal. Will I recommend it.....not really, if you see it on TV then go for it. Don't go out of your way, I used to love Dustin....what happened? I have to admit though that the only thing that got it to 3 stars is the ending, very inventive.",1495670400,,869,4.403726708074534
