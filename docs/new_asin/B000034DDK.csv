1256836,5,B000034DDK,"My, oh my...This is the direction that more filmmakers should take.  I don't believe that I have ever been so impressed by the imagery of a film from a first-time director as this.  Lodge Kerrigan sees angles, shots, and  displays mood better than most experienced directors, bar none. Picking  Peter Greene to play the lonely schizophreneic is a stroke of casting  genius, and all the more amazing, given Greene's penchant for  self-destructiveness.  The movie is very disturbing, particularly if you  have children, and I wouldn't hesitate to keep them out of the viewing  room, but the attention to detail is truly jawdropping, given the minute  budget.  This film was made over the course of 2 years, and although Greene  doesn't appear to age, Kerrigan's film shows a tremendously well thought  out visual flair.  Visually, it reminded me of some early David Lynch  works, minus the strange pointlessness and perverse sexuality.  Altogether,  a wonderful first effort, and an amazing, although largely unseen,  performance from Greene.  If you can keep your eyes on the screen, you will  be shocked and mesmerized.",949017600,17,1119,5.145251396648045
1256837,5,B000034DDK,"This film addresses the gross misconceptions concerning schizophrenia that unfortunately still simmer in the public consciousness today. ""Clean Shaven"" systematically names and attacks these misconceptions. First,  the film challenges the the prevailing idea that patients with  schizophrenia are more dangerous than the average individual. Second, this  film is untainted by embarrassing Freudian foolery. ""Clean  Shaven"" mocks the once-cherished theory that schizophrenia is due to  neurotic mothering, thrusting in its place a more enlightened ideology  informed by genetic research as to the etiology of this pervasive and  debilitating disease. This film is bone-chilling and, at times, reminiscent  of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" in its dogged attempts to accurately  depict a psychopathology that is grossly misrepresented in all forms of  media.",946425600,5,849,6.11864406779661
1256843,5,B000034DDK,"I was already fascinated with Peter Greene, so in checking out his filmography I came across this film. It sounded really good, so I decided to buy it, since many of his films are hard to come by in a video store. Needless to say I was blown away by this film itself and even more so by Peter Greene. He definetely made the film. I can't understand why he hasn't been in more roles such as this. He's definetely an underappreciated actor. The film haunted me...I thought about it and dreamed about it all night...which kept me from really sleeping...it just had such a profound effect on me. It really got inside my head. The fact it doesn't really say for sure that he is/isn't a killer...but the ending sequence made me believe he wasn't...I just wanted to give him a bug hug. Such a sad/intense film. I'm really glad I bought it.",1233014400,,832,4.409090909090909
1256844,5,B000034DDK,"This film is very intense and 79 minutes is about what I could take of it! We follow Peter (played by Peter Greene), a man with some kind of schizophrenia and parts of the film is how he sees the world. We are given very few explanations and the plot contains some interesting ambiguities. Clean, shaven is more about the audiovisual than about narrative and/or social criticism. Through the film we hear voices like an untuned radio, sometimes in the scene and sometimes it is inside Peter's head. Clean, shaven also contains a few quite nasty strong scenes (a corpse in close up, Peter trying to cut of his nail etc) that sensitive viewers should be prepared for. Even though the film is set in strange and ugly milieus like desolate industrial areas and shabby mansions it also contains a kind of beauty or at least it's own special aesthetics. Also, the actors are excellent, especially Peter Greene who manages to look really tormented throughout the movie.

The Criterion edition also contains some extras like commentary and a video essay. I'm really glad I have seen this special movie. Recommended to everyone interested in cinema, especially american independent!",1222732800,,1173,4.924242424242424

1256847,5,B000034DDK,"i'd heard about this film many years ago while having a ""disturbing films"" conversation with a coworker. the guy's opinions weren't generally that profound, but i made a mental note to check it out. that was maybe ten years ago and now i feel like i cheated myself...this is simultaneously one of the most beautiful and most depressing movies i've ever seen.

fans of eraserhead will love the sparse and desolate look to the locations. fans of experimental electronic music will marvel at the amazing soundtrack...and i mean actual sounds, not songs. in fact, there is a complete lack of music in this one; the sounds providing the background are the noises in peter's head and they range from tense to downright terrifying. peter greene's performance is gut wrenching as he delivers quite possibly the most sincere and touching depiction of severe mental illness i've ever seen on screen. if you think donnie darko was pathological, this character will haunt you for days.

and that is probably the main thing about it...i've been disappointed by a lot of movies lately, but this was downright wrenching to watch - i couldn't turn away for a minute even as the scenes of death and peter's deterioration got uglier and uglier. the closest effect i can think of is the initial ""punch in the gut"" of henry: portrait of a serial killer, but this lacks the tongue-in-cheek moments of that movie as well as its bleak and malicious sensibilities.

touching. moving. you might hate it, but if you want a brutally honest look at schizophrenia and the effects it has on the lives of anyone in its vicinity this needs to be seen. don't wait as long as i did.",1199923200,3,1648,4.735191637630662
1256848,2,B000034DDK,"The only positive part of this movie was Peter Greene's performance, he did a great job of portraying a mentally disturbed person.  The movie starts with no real direction, you're following around a mentally ill man who wants to find his young daughter.  After a while you're thinking ""OK, I get the picture, he's disturbed and lost, now what?""  Well, now nothing.  There really isn't anything more to this.  A pointless detective is added but he's idiotic.  If you want to know what this movie is like go downtown in almost any US city and follow around one of the disturbed homeless people for 80 minutes.  That's it, nothing more.  This didn't didn't elicit a single emotional response from me.  It was boring.

1256849,3,B000034DDK,"This mind trip advances in an edgy, contorted manner.  You'll feel trapped inside the head of a schizophrenic named Peter.  There is plenty of extreme closeups, attention to simple details, little sounds amplified.  He has a constant nervousness and some peculiar mannerisms.  As you are plunged into his brittle macrocosm, you'll get a strong sense of all these instabilities.
After Peter is released from a mental institute, he tries to absorb his surroundings while searching for his daughter.  There are some moments of self-mutilation that will make you cringe.
There are other parts of Clean, Shaven that can be hard to sit through.  The director really does well creating an uncomfortable setting.  My only problem with this movie is the opening scene.  It tries to set up the story and mislead you, but I found the truth too easily identifiable.

1256850,5,B000034DDK,"This chilling psychological thriller by first-time director Kerrigan was filmed over two years off the coast of New Brunswick, and was one of the first films to depict the agonizing, subjective experience of schizophrenia. With insight and sensitivity, Greene conveys the inner compulsions and emotional turbulence of his character with dead-on authenticity. Kerrigan's innovative use of sound--radio transmissions and white noise--and tight control over the reality of Peter's delusions (are they ours or his?) keeps the question of his guilt suspended until the very end. Note of caution: ""Clean, Shaven"" is not for everyone (especially if you're squeamish about self-mutilation), but it's an enthralling and utterly gripping mystery nevertheless.",1184112000,,749,5.8807339449541285

1256852,5,B000034DDK,"Peter Greene's portrayal of Peter Winter, a paranoid schizophrenic man, is heartbreaking and harrowing. But Clean, Shaven goes further, and allows us to experience some of what goes on in the man's mind.  The effect is disturbing but we begin to sympathize with the man as he searches for his little daughter. There is a whodunnit plot attached to the film, but the chief achievement of the film was to put us inside the mind of a sick, horribly isolated and profoundly suffering mind of Peter Winter.
Lodge Kerrigan and Peter Greene have created something great here. This film will disturb and unsettle you. I give it my highest recommendation.",1173571200,,646,4.872727272727273

1256874,4,B000034DDK,"""I Can Help Make the Dream That Obsesses You Come True Quickly."" So reads a newspaper advertisement, spread across a schizophrenic man's car window. Every glass surface on the vehicle, including rear and side-view mirrors, is covered in crumpled paper torn from a tabloid supermarket rag. Peter (Peter Greene, known to most as Zed from Pulp Fiction) doesn't like to see his own reflection. He drives along in his cocoon, insulated with monster babies, aliens, Elvis, and Playboy Playmates on killing sprees. Perhaps paper reflects better than glass.

Peter has other idiosyncrasies, to put it mildly. His morning coffee is poured into three cups, with great effort made to ensure equal levels of milk and sugar. He carries with him a torn photograph of a baby girl, probably his own (a plot device revisited in director Lodge Kerrigan's later picture, Keane), but we have to be careful with our assumptions. He also believes there to be a transistor under one of his fingernails, placed there during a scarring mental hospital sojourn. There's a corresponding receiver in his scalp - his attempts to remove these items are some of the more unsettling things you'll see put to film. Whether he succeeds or not is a matter a perspective, much like the rest of Clean, Shaven. It works well enough for him, so judge not lest ye be judged.

Peter's senses, like our own, are unreliable, colored by preconceptions and social forces. What we experience is not objective - Clean, Shaven demonstrates this, not simply by submerging us in Peter's warped, subjective point of view, but with reminders that our own point of view (specifically in regards to Peter) is warped as well. Guilt and innocence, as much as these concepts exist, are not so easily determined. Neither are ""crazy"" and ""sane"" (indeed, Clean, Shaven is most effective when we're forced to reexamine our own preconceived notions about mental illness). Life is often a collection of random images and sounds, white noise that can overwhelm us if we let it. Our ability to hear, and process what is heard, is based as much on what we tune out as what we tune in. Peter can't tune things out and for that he is ""sick."" We who are ""healthy"" are better at this, but I wonder how much better.

Clean, Shaven has a plot, barely (running time is a fleeting 80 minutes), centering on two parallel quests: Peter's search for someone who may or may not be his daughter and a police detective searching for Peter in connection with a murdered girl. The two men share some overt similarities - obsession with procedure and minutiae, the corporeal, proneness to violent outbursts. Kerrigan is a smart director, so this kind of narrative/character congruity (cop and criminal are of one mind), lazy clich in the hands of another, is at least tolerably subtle here. I imagine it's simply a nod to genre, or even an indictment of audience expectations. Perhaps it's filmmaker immaturity (it is his first picture, after all), but I'm willing to give Kerrigan the benefit of the doubt.

That's my own prejudice, but at least I'm honest about it.

Interesting footnote: In 2005, John Waters was asked to curate a series of films, with introduction and commentary, for ""America's premier gay television network"" Here! TV. John Waters Presents Movies That Will Corrupt You ran thirteen pictures, all with positive gay themes, the two notable exceptions being Irreversible (whose homophobic content frankly makes it a surprising selection to me) and Clean, Shaven.",1168992000,3,3499,4.933786078098472
1256875,4,B000034DDK,"Few movies I've seen recently have left me in the same state of shock and awe that Clean, Shaven has. That's not to say it's a masterpiece of cinema or one of my favorite films or even that it's worthy of 5 stars. But it is a fascinating character study that is very effective and unsettling. I first heard of the film via The Criterion Collection website. I didn't read too much into it, but what I did hear was intriguing enough for me to want to see it. One big factor was reviewers who compared it to two of my favorite movies Spider and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. This film and those two have similarities, but I found those films more entertaining, more effective, and creepier than this one. This movie does, however, have moments where it will flawlessly mess with your head. Peter Greene (an actor that's probably best recognized as Zed from Pulp Fiction) plays Peter Winter, a man with Schizophrenia. Instead of presenting us with a straightforward narrative, writer/director/producer Lodge Kerrigan takes a different route. By the end of the film, we're not sure what's real and what exists only in the mind of the main character. To say the film has a plot would be inaccurate, although elements of it combine to form a sort-of plot. The movie begins by establishing its mood and form of storytelling. Strange disconnected sounds play on the soundtrack, while Peter freaks out in the corner of a cell. In the next scene, we see what directions this movie is going to take. Peter sits in his car, when a young girl appears in front of it. He gets out of the car and on the soundtrack what appears to be him beating her and the sounds of her screaming. Whether this actually occurs, or not, is never made clear. In the next scene, Peter (while driving) begins inexplicably taping newspaper to the windows of the car and putting tape over the rearview mirror. The basic plot is that Peter is looking for his daughter Nicole. Her mother is dead and she was left to be raised by her grandma, who gave her up for adoption. Meanwhile, a detective is looking for the murderer of a young girl. He's fascinated with the case, since the young girl was found lying a field in a dress that has no evidence of blood or anything else on it. The movie will not appeal to many viewers. It moves at a slow snail-pace in many scenes, which will cause the average viewer to turn it off. I kept thinking that if Vincent Gallo had an inspiration for the way The Brown Bunny was made, he probably used this film. Although, I need to add that, most viewers will find this movie more endurable than that one. One of the things that amazed me a lot about this movie was Peter Greene. I've seen him in Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and The Mask but the man is, overall, an obsolete actor. Here he proves that he's very talented and has a lot of range. I'm surprised this film didn't lead him to more fruitful roles. I see a lot of movies and few of them, even the great ones, I want to watch again right away. This film was a movie I wanted to see again as soon as it was over. Not because I found it very entertaining, but because I don't think I was prepared for all the things it serves to you. This is definitely a movie people should check out.

1256876,5,B000034DDK,"In my personal opinion (less than an hour after first watching it), I have determined that I have just finished another of many film tasks; to find something unique and striking, and discover a new perspective on a certain level. But this 'something' is also extremely well made, and deep; it's also incredibly sad, and visually grotesque (a few scenes made me recoil, a rare enough occurance for a man who owns at least 300 DVDs, and has seen countless films with more gore, and even more gratuitous carnage). It is also one of the very best films I have ever seen.

The film is about a man named Peter Winter (played by Peter Greene [if you don't know who he is, slap yourself]), whom was recently released from a mental hospital for reasons unspecified. From then on he makes a journey of sorts to find his daughter, Nicole. Of course, if the film was merely about a sappy kind of father/child reunion, I would have stopped watching mid-way and called it a night, but there is a very huge problem with Peter. He is a schizophrenic, a man whose brain functions almost like a car radio, tuning in signals, noises, and bizarre voices, all displayed aurally in juxtaposition to the visuals (the effectiveness of this audio technique is so disturbing and enthralling that even David Lynch's personal sound man could not better it's precision). This not A Beautiful Mind. There is no easy way out, and there is no solution for his problem, and the film makes it a point to show you why he acts the way he does. After a while, the effect becomes so oddly familiar, that when, in one scene, Peter's actions are separated from this horrifying noise, we chillingly see the reality of his situation. The only way Peter can (temporarily) relieve himself of this horror is best left for you to find out. If you have a weak constitution, or stomach lining, then consider this a film to avoid, to dread. One scene is of such stunning depravity that it may very well make you leave the room in a state of uttter shock.

Seemingly, in a decade which was known for being upbeat (both to it's credit and sizable detriment), this little puppy dropped out of the sky in 1993 and stunned whatever few people were fortunate enough to hear it or watch it. I implore you, be one of those people.",1161302400,5,2273,4.541463414634146

1256878,5,B000034DDK,"Peter Winter (Peter Greene) is a tormented schizophrenic man who is let out of a hospital despite suffering from extreme symptoms of nearly continuous auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and a highly fragmented, discontinuous sense of reality. His one steady goal is to find his young daughter, Nicole (Jennifer MacDonald), who has begun a new life as an adoptee, following the murder of her mother. Peter first visits his own mother, a taciturn, emotionally withholding woman who is not at all pleased to see him. Later he discovers his daughter's whereabouts, when her adoptive mother brings Nicole to visit her grandmother (who is as chilly toward Nicole as she is toward Peter). Meanwhile, a police detective (Robert Albert), searching for a serial child killer, has concluded that Peter is his man. A fateful ending is set up when the detective encounters Peter with Nicole at an isolated beach.

There are serious flaws in this film: the screenplay is not well wrought and is too full of ambiguities, especially the entire serial child killing subplot. This is highly distracting. The acting is second rate, except for Greene's and MacDonald's performances. The film's strength lies in Kerrigan's insightful deployment of sound, setting and other effects to create the clinical realism of Peter's schizophrenic experience. Peter's intense, perpetual fear is palpable. Much of the film is shot in his car, where he has placed masking tape over the mirror, and newspaper over several windows, to fortify his privacy. The effect is an impacted atmosphere of paranoid insulation. Peter's hallucinated auditory experience - garbled voices, static and other noise, unaccompanied by any visual representations - is clinically valid. The voices and noise haunt him steadily. He tells Nicole he has had a radio device implanted in his head, with a transmitter in a fingernail. Earlier we had been exposed to his violent efforts to rid himself of these devices using scissors or a knife to gouge them out - forms of delusion-driven self-mutilation that are uncommon but not rare in persons suffering the throes of severe acute psychotic episodes. The use of tight close up camera angles - viewing Peter from just behind his back or in profile in his car - heighten the sense of claustrophobia, the extreme narrowing of Peter's psychotic world. The setting - Miscou Island, in New Brunswick - adds further accents of wildness and isolation to the overall tone of the film.

It can be argued that the detective's pursuit of Peter adds yet another source of paranoid fever to the film, though for me this conceit does not ring true. The fact that someone really is after Peter detracts from the power of his delusions. Other than this, Kerrigan can be congratulated for steering clear of the false visuals (realistically visualized imaginary friends and enemies) and other clinically implausible effects that Ron Howard used more recently in A Beautiful Mind. Anyone - professional or lay viewer - might rightly wonder how Peter could be discharged from the hospital in such poor psychiatric condition. Of course that happens every day in most contemporary short stay hospital settings, because involuntary treatment laws in most states prohibit keeping patients against their will except in the most extreme circumstances of immediate potential for violence. But we are given the impression at the start of this film that Peter had been incarcerated in a more traditional mental hospital, the sort in which people stay for long periods before discharge, until they appear relatively free of symptoms, sometimes longer. Of course these large old facilities are typically short staffed, keen clinical observation of patients may be scarce, and patients not uncommonly can muster a faade of normality to win their freedom.

The depiction of Peter's mother is also troublesome. Her grim withholding of affection for Peter and Nicole resurrects the spectra of the 'schizophrenogenic mother' - a psycho dynamic fiction popular the 1950s and 60s that accused parents, especially mothers, of causing schizophrenia through self serving, unaffectionate regard for their children. This myth was laid to rest long ago, and it is a black mark against this film to see such a notion resurrected. It does not dispel the power of this negative maternal portrayal when, from a distance, we see the mother crying as she hangs one of her son's shirts on a clothesline near the end.",1110672000,4,4455,5.167590027700831
1256879,5,B000034DDK,"This movie is challenging to watch.  It presents an unflinching look at a dysfunctional society and a profoundly disturbed man.  It's almost repulsively ugly; it is also fascinating, sad and true.

Much praise has been heaped on Peter Greene--better known for his role in The Mask--for his portrayal of Peter Winter, a man suffering a textbook case of Paranoid Schizophrenia.  This film invites us to look at how he perceives the world and how the world perceives him.  In one telling scene, a suspicious librarian reads intent into her interaction that we, the viewers, know is complete fabrication.  Who is the more paranoid?  Peter, who mutilates himself to escape the scrutiny of an unknown agency?  Or the society who interprets everything he does as dangerous and scary?

This film offers no easy solutions.  I've seen it a good dozen times; I've taught the film to freshman college classes.  And I still find more in it when I rewatch it, particularly when I discuss the experience with others.  It demands that you think and more, that you feel.  If you'd rather not do that, this isn't going to be your film.

Even if you don't mind doing that, this might not be your film.  It is grotesque and tragic.  Every time I watch it, I am moved by the starkness of its physical and emotional environment--the loneliness, the yearning, not only of Peter, but of everyone we encounter.",1103414400,4,1385,4.780590717299578
1256880,2,B000034DDK,"Clean, Shaven (Lodge Kerrigan, 1994)
Kerrigan, since this debut film, has gone on to work with some of the biggest names in Hollywood. Which should give most aspiring filmmakers hope, because after watching Clean, Shaven, someone obviously saw through the film's glaring problems to get at the potential that equally obviously exists underneath. You're not going to find it here, though.
Peter Winter (Peter Greene, from The Usual Suspects, Judgment Night, Pulp Fiction, etc.) is not a very nice guy. He also happens to be severely mentally ill; nothing is ever said about what it is he's got, though it becomes quickly obvious that schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder are two of his major problems. Upon his release from a mental institution (which you will only know if you read the box description), he finds that his wife has left him and put his daughter up for adoption (which is revealed very far into the film, but you will know if you read the box description). While he searches for his daughter, a police officer, Jack McNally (Robert Albert), is trying to tie Winter to a series of murders that seem to happen whenever he's around.
After reading that plot synopsis, one thing should be very clear: if you don't read the box description, you will have no earthly idea what's going on in this movie. Sometimes that works very well (like in Memento). Sometimes it acts to the film's great detriment. Someone should have given Kerrigan a kick in the continuity a few times while he was making this film; too much of it doesn't add up until the final few scenes, and by that time, it's far too late. Greene's performance is almost painful to watch, but everything going on around him plays second fiddle; thus, the movie seems like a too-long character sketch into which a plot was thrown as an afterthought. Greene's performance alone isn't enough to carry the weight. **",1072051200,4,1891,4.839506172839506

1256892,2,B000034DDK,"Clean, Shaven is an account of a schizophrenic man's (Peter) attempts to find and reclaim his daughter, who has apparently been placed up for adoption by relatives while Peter was incarcerated in a mental hospital. The stylistic tics director Lodge Kerrigan uses to provide insight into the mind of a schizophrenic -- short sequences where the camera is aimed at something quiet and banal (like the view from a moving car), accompanied by  nonsensical (?) radio-staticky voiceovers -- also succeed in creating some slight tension. That said, these scenes are plentiful and while interesting, can't provide any real narrative pull for the viewer to get caught up in. However, the film's real weakness is that it  wants to be both a snapshot of life as a deranged person and a deft psychological thriller -- a tough combination to pull off. The motivations for Peter's behavior are left ambiguous (in an attempt to mask a would-be twist ending); leaving  Peter a difficult character to empathize with. The story wanders along until a detective begins seeking Peter for reasons related to a series of child murders. The detective also behaves very erratically (he has emotional outbursts alone in his car; he seeks sex with a woman related to the case; and he employs an incoherent logic in pursuing Peter -- it seems impossible that the clues shown would lead the detective to Peter's location). At times it's difficult to remember which of the two characters is supposed to be the crazy one. Throw in a lusty librarian and several scenes of graphic mutilation and you end up with ... well, with very little. Here is a movie that ends up being less than the sum of its parts -- and its parts weren't all that thrilling to begin with.",1020816000,9,1731,4.821548821548822

As a veiwer, I found myself really empathizing with the character, and truly understanding what it must be like to have such a condition.  For that part of the movie, ""Clean Shaven"" was remarkable, and the character was excellent.  The mother of this character was also very good in the movie.
As for the rest of the movie, I have to say that it did not hold up to Peter Winter's performance.  The plot was flimsy and it never really went anywhere.  The acting by the librarian had to be the worst I have ever witnessed, and I almost found it laughable.  As for Lodge Kerrigan's character, I never really understood what his motivation was half the time, didn't know what he was doing, and I was often left thinking, ""so what....""  Why did he sleep with the woman?  How did he find Peter at the beach?  What was the robbery scene all about?
The movie was a good examination of ""getting inside"" someone suffering with schizophrenia, some nice cinematography, and very accurate in its views on society's prejudices and fears about mental illness.  The minimal script and conversation seemed forced and canned at times, not really leaving a good impression.  I liked the movie, but Peter Winter was the reason for that.",1019692800,5,1553,4.775280898876405
1256895,5,B000034DDK,"""clean shaven"" is one of the most horrifyingly disturbing movies i've ever seen, and it is unbelievably depressing. i love insanity trip/art house/horror movies, but this movie was a little much even for me. i admired the movie enormously for the obvious value it has a red flag for how severely needy and intensely mentally ill people are simply unloved even by those who should love them most and how cold and unfeeling our society is towards them, but would not watch it again for twenty dollars. keep in mind, however, that if you're looking for art house' madness this ain't it, it's simply the real thing in sad, full, sickening color. this is not ""fun"" weird at all--this is just poignant and devastating filmmaking. the only thing i would criticize are the many questions left unanswered, such as who nicole's mother really was and how she died, how peter managed to even get out on the street, etc. but all in all this movie is one of the most powerful i've ever seen, and absolutely important. it almost made me want to cry, and movies never do that to me.",1017964800,10,1066,4.5863874345549736
1256896,5,B000034DDK,"Clean, Shaven boasts a superb performance by Peter Greene, an incredibly tight script, wonderfully minimalist cinematography, and has some of the best, most memorable sound work this side of The Conversation.
(No less an authority than Roger Ebert named it one of his ten best films of 1994).
Kerrigan's debut(!) film... takes us straight inside the head of a recently released schizophrenic. I can't recall the last time a film took me so far into the mind of a character. It's a sad commentary on our society that the airbrushed,  cleaned-up ""A Beautiful Mind"" is getting so much attention for its Hollywoodized portrayal of schizophrenia while few people have ever heard of this far better film. Not for the easily frightened, to be sure (the fingernail scene is with me still), but for those who still care about filmmaking as more than just mindless entertainment, it's here.
My only disappointment with the DVD is that we don't get commentaries from either Kerrigan or Greene, which would have been absolutely fascinating.",1016409600,7,1028,5.047058823529412
1256897,5,B000034DDK,"This is a great film about a schzophrneaic that is released from an insane ayslum.  Peter Green (Pulp Fiction, The Mask) pulls in  a powerful and unforgetable preformence.  The plot follows Green as he goes to his home town insearch of his daughter.  When he gets there, a young girl is murdered and a P.I. goes after Green.  The movie is brillently acted with very little dialoge from everyone in the movie.  The movie won several awards in Sundance Film Festival and made someone faint during a showing at Sundance.  A well disvered 5 star movie, see this one ASAP.",997315200,5,567,4.61

1256899,5,B000034DDK,"I caught attention of this hardly known gem at a local video store, noticing bold statements as ""Dare to watch it"" and ""Boldest, most unforgettable film of the year.""  This is one film where you can believe the hype.  Not since ""Henry: Portrait of a serial killer"" has a movie really shown an in-depth cinematic representation of the mind of a serial killer.  But ""Clean, Shaven"" is a step above films like ""Henry"" and ""Man Bites Dog"".  Winner of many awards, it tells a simple story of Peter Winter, a very dangerous schizophrenic just released from an institution, and his search for his daughter, while at the same time police are trying to catch up with him.  Peter Greene is absolutely convincing as the deranged schizophrenic...he shows no emotion as he shaves his head and cuts his scalp in the process, nor is oblivous to pain during a very notable scene involving his fingernail and a very sharp object.  And Kerrigan's excellent direction is what moves this film to near brillance...Instead of just telling the story with characters speaking to one another, he forces us into the mind of the schizophrenic.  The movie is told mainly by images and sounds, as if what Winter was really experiencing...scenes are made unsettling by disturbing sampling and music, with long scenes of almost surreal images, intesifying the tension of the movie.  After watching ""Clean, Shaven"", you'll have the feeling of meeting a real-life schizophrenic.  Not many movies can boast this fact, nor make it realistic, but ""Clean, Shaven"" does that, and more.  One of the most unforgettable films, indie or not, in the past few years.",982713600,47,1622,4.908424908424909
1256900,5,B000034DDK,"This is an amazing film.  With this movie alone, Kerrigan soared to the top of my favorite directors list, right along with Lynch, Altman, and  Polanski.  An extremely careful and beautful heart-felt effort having  nothing to do with Hollyewood's commercialism.  I saw it first here at The  Cleveland Cinematheque, went back the next night, and then found the video,  which I've watched half a dozen times.  On just the strength of this one  film, I drove to Chicago to see Kerrigan's second film, CLAIRE DOLAN, which  is another masterpiece in my book.  Kerrigan is the best new director I've  seen since Lynch.",966124800,7,612,4.892156862745098
1256901,4,B000034DDK,"I'm French and I had read very good reviews about this movie, but I just saw it on TV a few weeks ago, under the name ""Psychopath"". I was really impressed. Sometimes it is rather difficult to watch it, because of  the breathtaking atmosphere, and some scenes are really gorey. But it is  one of the only films where you really get INTO the head of a  schizophrenic, and it's frightening. The sound work is just incredible,  with the mixed radio frequencies (even in French version). David Lynch's  ""Eraserhead"" is maybe the only other film where, from the  beginning to the end, experimental sound effects are so important. The plot  is maybe just a bit light and blur, but Peter Greene has such a strong  presence. And Lodge Kerrigan manages to bring some emotion in a very cold,  clinic and stripped down filming: it's not just a brilliant stylish  exercise, it's also a deeply moving human artwork. Definitely great,  deserves to be discovered.",960681600,10,947,4.748466257668712

7916511,5,B000034DDK,"Very still, eerie, paranoid movie. I don't think there is a movie that portrays schizophrenia impeccably accurate to the point that it's almost terrifying. The acting is spot on, the movie moves in great pace and keeps the viewer engaged the entire time. The best thing about this entire movie is that it doesn't hold your hand for one second. It's beautifully shot, and this movie alone shows that Peter Greene truly is an under-appreciated/underrated actor. Check it out if you love great, obscure movies.",1476662400,,507,4.976470588235294
7916512,5,B000034DDK,"I rented this movie because I'm a huge horror fan.  I read this movie was crazy, and it delivered.  I was interested to watch it because Peter Greene (the star) was also a villain in ""The Usual Suspects"", and of course, "" Pulp Fiction"".  So I knew this guy could handle his own movie.  This movie is taxing on the mind - it offers a never ending soundtrack of a schizophrenic mind.  If you don't want to know what that sounds like, to be crazy, for the duration of the movie, skip it.  I almost gave up and found myself rewarded.",1457827200,,529,4.188118811881188
7916513,5,B000034DDK,"I I like that the movie shows him with a chip in his head.  They put one in my brain too, now it is giving me dizziness..They are giving me an eeg.  I hope they will remove it.  The goverment put it in my head when I was in the ICU after a suicide attempt. The voices told me to do it.  I do not know why I am writting this review, since you all can read my mind.
However, the movie does not show the cameras that they put on people with schizophrenia. They even put one in my bathroom!!!  We are no treat to anyone, but the goverment thinks otherwise.  They also put in the movies that somehow we are bad people, this is not the case.  I would never harm anyone, the voices only tell us to hurt ourselves, not any one else.
Overall it is a good movie.  However, a beautiful mind and shutter Island is better of a movie, but the both of them are Hollywod films.  Then comes Canvas is also a good movie and is not a Hollywood film.",1454112000,,930,3.956989247311828

7916517,5,B000034DDK,"Lodge Kerrigan made a demolishing study about the schizophrenia around the figure of a very disturbed man n his early thirties who had a beautiful girl of ten years old. Once he is released from the mental institution, he tries to establish the expected filial contact with his daughter.

But during this encounter we will be witness of his serious mental damage. His breakdown nature, his imposibility for maintaining a lucid conversation (even with his mother) the ghosts that haunt him, the opressive situation in which it is, his way of living, his desperation, loneliness and obsession have never been brought to ithe big screen with major frenzy; (as a matter of fact, you might include The girl in the match factory, The element of the crime and Enter the void in these last years).

But what the script remarks admirably is the obsesive determination of the police inspector who runs parralel when he has to track down the murderer of a little girl in the town and how this compulsion works out with the same patterns; only that we validate thisbehavior because he is on the right side of the good guys although certain details here and there.

A powerful, incisive and tragic episode. A brilliant cult film of the Nineties. Be for sure.",1325808000,,1245,4.78139534883721
7916518,3,B000034DDK,"Three and a half stars actually. Interesting choice for Criterion. The mood is similar to ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" but thats where similarity ends. The problem with this film is I had recently replaced a worn out copy of ""Scared Straight"", a prison documentary with death row inmates talking with high school kids who were all petty criminals themselves. The inmates threaten and verbally abuse the kids to scare them straight so as not to land up in prison. The dialogue is offensive and its a great piece of work. The director of ""Clean,  Shaven"" must have thought so too; he has incorporated almost all the abusive dialogue lifted straight from the film as his character's audio hallucinations! I thought some of the background ambient voices and phrases sounded mighty familiar and got SS out to compare. It really hurt my original criticism of ""Clean, Shaven"". Had he come up with his own offensive and intimidating banter it would have made this a more durable piece of work. Still, disturbing and worth seeing. Lead actor reminds me a lot of Peter Weller.",1289779200,,1074,4.836956521739131

Peter Greene is astounding as the protagonist, who suffers daily the torments of his condition, and his effort to locate his missing (to him) daughter is almost superhuman.
