5084337,5,B007FZ7OI4,OMG I loved Tuff Turf and Heathers. This was SUCH a throwback to the eighties.  Love Kim Richards and James Spader in Tuff Turf. If you're into the 80's stuff - these are it!,1401408000,,174,4.117647058823529
5084338,5,B007FZ7OI4,I watched these great 80s movies growing up and just introduced them to my teenage daughter. These movies are so much better than what these kids are watching these days!,1367107200,,170,4.7
8516068,5,B007FZ7OI4,"Purchased for my dad who is 52 and always talking about the better days lol. He had actually not seen The boys next door movie and after watching clips of it on youtube i decided this would be a great purchase. He opened it up yesterday with a few others present around his age group who were also cheerful and excited explaining how great these movies were. That alone solidified i had made a great gift purchase. Would recommend as a flash from the past movie night or a purchase for a parent who lived it up in the 80s. Also, its Charlie Sheen- hes awesome!! :P",1514246400,,564,4.280373831775701

8516070,4,B007FZ7OI4,"I mostly just bought this for the pack for ""Tuff Turf."" It's a very 80s film that stars James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. as high school kids who stand up to the local school gang. I'm not crazy about James Spader, and the only real reason I saw Tuff Turf in the first place was because of RDJ (I'm a huge fan), but I have to admit, he was actually okay in this movie. I've seen it a few times and liked it so much I wanted to own it. The other two movies on the other hand are just okay. I hadn't seen ""Heathers"" in ages and it is entertaining but something I'd only watch like once every couple of years. ""The Boys Next Door"" is the worst of the three. I watched it and I'll probably never watch it again. It's slow. The acting is nothing special. The story seems kind of pointless. Honestly, the description on the back was more interesting than the movie itself. It might have had potential, but it was just poorly executed. I honestly had never even heard of the movie until I bought this pack, and like I said, it's not worth watching more than once (if even that).",1507507200,,1072,4.158653846153846
