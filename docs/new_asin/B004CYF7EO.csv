8423880,5,B004CYF7EO,"If you like the good ole days of tv when talented, genuinely funny men were the headliners of the late hour after the local news then you will love this. Please just start up the reruns of the Jack Paar show and then lead up to Johnny Carson and get rid of the late night hosts and shows that are on now. I think the reruns would do better. Anyone with a sense of decency and that are lovers of talented, funny late night  tonight show formats would prefer the old shows. I have tried to watch the current shows and some of the late offerings that are no longer on and frankly they just do not have the talent or the magic. They cannot hope to hold a candle to Jack Paar or to Johnny Carson.",1421884800,,691,4.043795620437956
8423881,2,B004CYF7EO,sound quality is awful. can't hear any dialogue. This particular Show wasn't that good anyway. Later episodes are better. Don't bother with this one,1404172800,,148,5.208333333333333

8423883,5,B004CYF7EO,It is simply wonderful to be able to jump back in time and spend New Year's Eve with Johnny Carson.  Amazon delivers the quality; Johnny delivers the entertainment.  Five BIG Stars!,1368057600,,181,4.806451612903226
8423884,4,B004CYF7EO,"Good sample of Johnny's early work from New York. I wish this were the entire episode, but it is not. So beware.
I would like to ask the seller why these episodes are not complete shows.",1304121600,7,186,4.194444444444445
