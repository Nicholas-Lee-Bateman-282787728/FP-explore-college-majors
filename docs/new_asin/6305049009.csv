7881335,5,6305049009,"I loved this program. It showed a view of the Kalahari at night when all the nocturnal animals come out.  It showed bat-eared foxes, veldt vignettes that few have ever seen, bush babies, a brown hyena, prickly porcupines and hedgehogs, black-footed cats, and lots of footage of the rare aardvark digging his labyrinth of tunnels that the others live in when he moves on. I simply could not stop watching this program.  It was wonderful.  I highly recommend it to any nature lover.  I am particularly fond of this one because it shows animals that are seldom seen in any other program that I am aware of.  I plan on watching it many times.  So will you.",989366400,,652,4.52991452991453
