Much better than I expected. Lord Of The Lions is an excepionally good Documentary On George Adamson. A very touching interview with George Adamson shows what a Great Person he was and what he tried to achieve. Highly recommended for anyone that has an interest in Lions in Africa and India. These DVD's highlight the difficulties with the Lions struggle to survive in the wild. Well worth purchasing.",1222387200,16,580,6.448717948717949

3136021,1,B0014Y57EK,"I was so looking forward to receiving this box set of videos as lions are some of my favorite animals and I love watching them.  I was sorely disappointed due to the terrible quality of the videos.  It was so bad that I checked my DVD player for loose cables and thought the problem was my hardware until I put in a totally different video and found that the problem was not my equipment, it was indeed the poor quality of the videos.  So now I'm stuck with a box set of videos that are virtually unwatchable.  Personally, I feel that the quality is so poor that this product should not even be sold on Amazon or by any reputable seller.",1358294400,4,637,4.239669421487603
3136022,4,B0014Y57EK,"The scenes in this collection show the gentler side of African lions.  George Adamson and his wife, Joy, raised the lioness, Elsa, and habilitated her to the wild, as reflected in the books, Born Free and its sequels.  Those who think of lions only as effecient killing machines can see other aspects of their lives in this collection.",1345680000,3,335,4.758620689655173
3136023,5,B0014Y57EK,"I completely love anything on Lions.  These are filmed beautifully with information on lions lives in the wild.  They draw you in and inspire one to do more for conservation and the protection of these magnificant animals.  Very enjoyable to watch over and over again.  If you are a lion lover, you should add this to your library.",1327881600,5,331,4.655172413793103
3136024,1,B0014Y57EK,"I was supposed to receive four different dvds but I only received three.  I did not receive ""the Lions of Gir"" and instead there was two copies of the ""Lions of Etosha"" in the boxset.",1303862400,2,183,4.228571428571429
3136025,5,B0014Y57EK,"This collection gives a look at the ""King of Beasts"" that is neither melodramatic nor overly romanticized. Lions have captured man's imagination for time immemorial. All the programs are pretty much even-handed, for these animals are predators. Still, there is something about the lion that is by turns admirable, repellant, fascinating, terrifying, and this collection is utterly absorbing.

This was actually a gift for someone, and he was delighted with the quality of the trasfers.

For someone truly interested in wildlife documentaries, this is a solid collection for the price.",1294444800,12,584,5.477777777777778

3136027,5,B0014Y57EK,"this set of 4 dvd  has 1 disk that is of particular interest, would of bought it alone, had we had the chance, but to get the disk of george adamson is very rare, so just being able to get it at all, is a bonus and makes this set very worth while.  the presention and packaging is very good, a quality product,  the actual filming and qualitly of documentry is of a standard you would expect from 20 year ago out bush.
I 'treasure' the disk of Lord of the lions, George Adamson, and find it most worth while and enjoyable, but anyone wanting detail on George would feel the same.  The other disk i find interesting is lions and hyenas,  but so far have not had the time to view it.",1231200000,19,681,4.090225563909774

The gem of the collection has to be the George Adamson programme by Sandy Gall-a rare find on DVD,and a wonderful but at the same time very pougnant to a man who was to die so soon after the programme was completed. It stands as a fitting tribute to this great man,and I can thoroughly recommend  both the film and the set.",1519516800,,408,4.368421052631579
