8179643,5,B000NO2FPG,"After having watched this game last when it was originally aired, I recently found myself very interested in acquiring the NCAA On Demand copy for my own. The package and disc are very simple, with a generic women's basketball photo and a listing of the two competing teams. Frills aren't necessary, because I can promise you that if you're buying this for the game, the game is all you care about.

The presentation of the game itself is very straightforward. It is the ESPN broadcast, naturally, and consists of the game and only the game. There are no pre-game or post-game interviews. There are no commercials. It's a copy of the championship game. Period. End of story.

Now, concerning the actual game...

Unless I'm mistaken, this was the year Geno Auriemma coined the phrase, ""We have Diana, and you don't."" It's so true watching this game. Taurasi remains one of the greatest, if not the greatest, player in the history of UConn basketball, and if you want to see those talents showcased on a grand scale, this is the game for you. She is aided by outstanding teammates Ann Strother, Maria Conlon, Barbara Turner and Jessica Moore. As a UConn fan, there are few games more satisfying than when Tennessee loses, especially in a championship setting. They played a great game, but UConn would not be denied.

One last thing I have to mention is the service provided by Amazon in receiving this disc. The first time it was mailed UPS left the package where my dog could reach it, and from what I can tell he had an absolutely awesome time destroying it. I let Amazon know on a Wednesday and received my free replacement copy on Friday. No matter how you look at it, that's truly fantastic service and it will keep me coming back for more. Thank you, Amazon.",1298592000,,1763,4.641025641025641
