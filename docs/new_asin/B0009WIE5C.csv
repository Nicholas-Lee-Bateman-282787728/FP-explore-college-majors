2327241,5,B0009WIE5C,"My children (4, 6 & 8yo) love this series, and this latest addition is no exception. They sing along with the songs (especially the punctuation song), and are learning at the same time.",1143504000,,185,4.636363636363637
2327242,5,B0009WIE5C,"My son was diagnosed with Pervasive Development Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified when he was 3. PDD-NOS is on the Autism spectrum, and children with this diagnosis often have developmental delays.

My son had a speech delay and other developmental delays. His speech is great now...no one can detect that he has this diagnosis. However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.

While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading. He gets tired and frustrated.

Well, trying many approaches for helping him, I thought I'd take a chance and get the Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory DVD from Amazon.com, especially since the reviews were so good.

My son IMMEDIATELY took to this DVD and watches it over and over! He's sounding out letters, ""chunking"", and trying to read on his own. I know that this DVD, along with Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory I, have contributed to his quick progress.

The premise of this DVD is this: Mr. Websley (remember that grumpy duck from the other DVD's?) builds a Storybook Factory to create talking storybooks. Leap, Lily, and their friends act out ""The Three Little Pigs"", while Professor Quigley captures the scenes and words for the book. Tad, Leap and Lily's younger brother, is the narrator and is frustrated that he's having trouble reading. While he tries to read the script, he learns chunking and inflection and begins to gain confidence in his reading.

The cool thing is that large text appears on the bottom of the screen during the scenes, with the words highlighted as Tad speaks them.

Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory also teaches story comprehension, understanding character and plot, and even punctuation! There's a great section on punctuation with incredibly catchy tunes and visuals about periods (""full stop!""), commas, exclamation points, and question marks. My son goes around the house singing the lively tune ""Punc, Punc, Punc Punctuation..."" It's great!

I feel this DVD is better suited to children who are ready to read and who have mastered (or are beginning to master) 3 letter words and can sound out words on their own.

Highly recommended!",1138406400,125,2252,5.032258064516129
2327243,5,B0009WIE5C,"In the Product Description it says that this video is for the 3 to 6 year old age range, but having children in that range myself, I can tell you that this is incorrect.  For unlike the other Leapfrog videos, this one is really meant for older children who are either on the verge of reading, or who have just started reading.

I say this from observation of my son (3.5) and daughter (5.5) and their friends.  Those of them that are almost reading, or who are sounding out short words and sentences, understand the importance of punctuation and 'get' the songs and the points of the story which emphasize inflection and reading naturally (chunking).

For the younger ones it just passes over their heads which is perfectly understandable since they haven't a good idea of what sentences and paragraph structure is all about.

Five Stars.  It's short, but for the right kids it's an invaluable tool for teaching about story structure and reading.  Young children will watch Lily, Tad and the gang, but don't expect them to learn much.

But buy this video.  If you have the other videos (which are amazing) go ahead and get this one to go along with them.  When the time is right, your child will just absorb this information like they did their letters.",1134172800,212,1253,4.6289592760181
2327244,5,B0009WIE5C,My daughters enjoy this dvd. My 6 year old is already reading much better. She has learn to pause and stop in all the right places. I am very happy with this purchase.,1132531200,34,167,4.090909090909091
2327245,3,B0009WIE5C,"My five year old loves this DVD, like all the ""Leap"" DVD's: but conceptually, too much is stuffed into 35 minutes.  I realize that the relatively short format of ""Leap"" videos is one of the reson why they hold young children's interest so readily: but like ""Math Circus"", too many concepts are jammed into too short a time.  Tad learns to read too quickly! Again - Mr. Websley is creepy.  The better things about this video, are the stronger female presence (Lily's in charge)and the absence of annoying Professor Quigley. And I can't fault the punctuation portion, which teaches what those items are in a way that's memorable and easy to understand.",1130284800,23,650,4.785714285714286
2327246,5,B0009WIE5C,"I love all the Leapfrog DVDs that we have, and without a doubt pre-ordered this DVD even before it became available.

My 30 month old loves this DVD as much as The Letter Factory and The Word Factory.  When he ""mastered"" the other two DVDs, I felt a sense of emptiness not being able to find anything else quite like them to keep his interest.  So you can imagine how elated I was when I found out there is another new DVD!

He now knows his commas, periods, question marks and also exclamation marks, and point them out to me when I read his favourite bedtime storybooks.  Before this DVD, he was oblivious to their existence.  And whenever I am at the computer, he will hit the comma & period keys on a Word document (not possible for exclamation marks and question marks, as these require the SHIFT key) all on his own, which means he has learnt them too!

Looking forward to more DVDs from Leapfrog!",1130198400,18,903,4.37125748502994
2327247,5,B0009WIE5C,I have all of the movies and my girls (4 and 5) love all of them.  I purchased the letter factory one last year just to see what they were like.  After they watched it five times in a row I went out and purchased the others that were out at that time.  They were also big hits.  They never get tired of them.  I bought this one the day it came out and will purchase any that come out in the future.  They are only about 35 minutes long but it is short enough to hold the attention of even a very busy two year old which was the age my youngest one was when I bought the first one.,1129075200,10,580,3.7520661157024793

2327337,5,B0009WIE5C,"I have to say the same thing about this and any other Leap Frog learning video.  The children memorize the songs and learn from them so much easier than a boring lesson that resembles a lecture.  The children dance to the music and can be seen repeating the lyrics while playing somewhere else.  This video really zeros in on the children's receptive learning skills.  This ""learn to read"" video is great for children just developing the awareness of letter sounds and how to combine them to make words they can actually read.  It excites the children to recognize words and gives them a great sense of accomplishment.",1448409600,,618,4.738317757009346

I mean, they did actually teach us to read and write in Kindergarten back then, and we went all day, but I didn't have this cool pen that sounded out the words for me when I dragged it over them.  That is incredible! The story is amusing and entertaining too. Imagine how much more perspicacious we would be if this was developed in our generation vs the Speak-n-Spell.

I have to buy a new Leap system for my grandson.  My kids' got passed down to the nephews. I only hope that I do an even better job this time around.  I mean our kids all skipped grades after elementary home school.  We gave them the choice to either go the junior high or wait til high school.  They chose junior.  They far exceeded our expectations. Its just that I feel I could have done better by them.  I feel these LeapFrog products were definitely my better choices.

This entire system and its accessories is vibrant in color, stories, activities, core subjects and keeping attention, I mean gosh!!! Way to go! Im grateful both to the manufacturer and Amazon seller.  We are not rich. This fits our tight budget.",1429056000,,1147,4.393364928909953

2327537,4,B0009WIE5C,"The ideal audience for this movie are those who already know how to read individual words, but have not yet combined them into sentences to make a story.

THE MOVIE
The Leap kids are filming a movie of the classic story ""The Three Little Pigs"" and Tad is asked to narrate.  He starts somewhat slow as he struggles to read the words of the script.  He's then instructed how to read in a normal speaking voice and as the words are being read, they show up along the bottom bar of the tv screen so your child can follow along.  By the end of the movie, the words are moving so quickly across the screen that it would be hard for any beginner to keep up.

SUMMARY
While the story-line is entertaining and the principal of how Tad is taught to read is correct, the beginning reader is easily lost in the rate of speed the lines are read which can be frustrating.  My 3-year-old son loves the earlier movies:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Letter-Factory/dp/B001TKUXUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Letter Factory</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Talking-Words-Factory/dp/B001U7NW20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Word-Caper/dp/B00361XWDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Word Caper</a>, but at this point he watches this movie just for the enjoyment.",1345507200,2,1484,6.46969696969697

The cover and 2011 date give you the impression you are getting another episode but you aren't. Be careful because LeapFrog doesn't number the products. I'm sure this just is another example of great American marketing efforts that feel that products do better if you just change the colors or pictures for no reason.

The Leap Frog Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, and Code Word Caper are some of the best resources I've found.  These movies systematically introduce and teach the basics of phonics in an effective and creative way.  The Letter Factory is particularly good and appropriate for children as young as two.

The Story Book Factory and the The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park don't follow a well structured system nor do they do a good job of teaching the things they presume to teach such as punctuation.  Taken as a movie for entertainment, the Amusement Park one is bearable but the Story Book Factory is very dumb.  That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 3.

The best one to start with is Letter Factory when they are a little younger (maybe 3-4), next would be word caper or word factory(4-5), and then lastly would be this one on reading each word and making sentences, etc.  Great movie for assisting with teaching your child to read.",1294444800,,594,4.276785714285714

2327562,3,B0009WIE5C,"This is a decent video but not essential.  Now, the Letter Factory is definitely a must-have.  My son is almost 4 yrs old and has been moved to the ""Early Reading Program"" at his preschool even though his age group is typically in Phonics first, then upon an assessment of readiness, they are moved to reading.  He knew all his letters by 18 months old and knew the sounds of each letter by  3.  If you are looking to help your child learn letters, you should definitely get the Letter Factory.  It's amazing and fun to watch.  My son wanted to watch that more than the Baby Einsteins (other than Baby Macdonald).

If you are wanting your child to read by 3 or 4, then this video is not going to help in my opinion.  It may possibly help for an older age group -- If anything, it helps get children almost ready to read in the right mind-set and tries to make it fun.  My son watched it a few times but wasn't hooked on it.  One thing that I didn't like is that the video only uses capital letters and that is not helpful when any book you pick up is going to have both upper and lower case letters.  If the child only sees words with all capital letters, than this is not going to help with reading a real beginner book like ""cat in the hat"".  The lower case letters are going to be foreign.

From my internet research, children that can read at age 3 are usually the ones that learned by word-recognition/memory (i.e. not actually reading).  Like my son recognizes the word ""STOP"" because its on all the stop signs, it's background is always red, and in the same shape.",1255478400,12,1571,4.260135135135135

2327569,5,B0009WIE5C,"Personally, I got the entire DVD boxset. However this has got to be my favorite of the bunch. Not only it's the only story in the entire boxset where Dot has speaking roles (in fact, it's the only DVD in the entire series where characters other than the frogs, Quigley and Websley has speaking roles, unless you take ""A Tad of Christmas Cheer"" into consideration as well, and even then the only other character with speaking lines is Parker), I personally liked the songs on the DVD as well, and the humor is enjoyable and kept my attention.

The only one complaint I've heard of the DVD (and all the DVD sets in general) is the lack of closed captioning and/or subtitling for the hearing impaired. Granted, this is title actually has some subtitling going on, but it would be nice if the entire story was captioned/subtitled from start to finish, since there are folks who want to absorb in the lyrics of the songs, and folks who, of course, need the captioning for obvious reasons.

Still, I give the title 5 stars. Only major flaw aside, the story is actually what I consider the best in the series next to ""A Tad of Christmas Cheer"". It's funny, it does what it's supposed to do and more, and there's actually subtle references to pop culture that keeps older viewers entertained as well.",1234224000,,1292,4.564655172413793
