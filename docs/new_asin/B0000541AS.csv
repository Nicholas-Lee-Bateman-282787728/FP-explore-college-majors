7930555,5,B0000541AS,"First, I am a model train nut.  I have 40 by 12 feet downstairs to devote to several train platforms where as many as 11 trains can run at the same time.  Add to that one platform that runs 10 battery powered Thomas the Tank Engine engines.  The video in question is part of a series called I Love Toy Trains that has 12 half hour shows that is almost totally watching various toy trains run around.  You would think that my 12 grandkids would get tired of it and some do as they get older, but they delight in finding trains in the video that look like mine or theirs.  My wife finds the child in the first 12 videos aggravating and so was delighted to have one of these videos where no one speaks.  They are entertaining for the rest of either way and we split our train time between these videos and the real thing downstairs.  The same company has also produced our favorite called John Deere Heaven where all of the trains, and everything else is green and yellow.  We have something similar downstairs.
Thank you,
Jim Furman",1377820800,,1030,4.328125
