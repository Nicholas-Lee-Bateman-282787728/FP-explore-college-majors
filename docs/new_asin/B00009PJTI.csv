7992326,5,B00009PJTI,"No Day of the Triffids in my set, as well. Was very disappointed as it would have been a great set. May send it back. I gave it 5 stars for Little Shop of Horrors and Graveyard Tramps. TO NOTE:Looking at all of the other reviews...all this time has passed and ,yet, no change has been made in the title",1182038400,,302,4.05
7992327,2,B00009PJTI,"Bought this title to see Triffids, but Triffids was NOT included.  What a disappointment.",1179705600,2,89,5.357142857142857
7992328,1,B00009PJTI,"This collection does not include the movie ""Day of the Triffids"" despite what the title says. I sent it back.",1165968000,,109,4.5
7992329,1,B00009PJTI,"Okay, there's been a BIG mix up here. Well, maybe not so big in the grand scheme of things, but if you followed the DVD link from the imdb page for the film ""Alien Predator"", which stars Dennis Christopher and...other people, to this Amazon page, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. Even though Amazon lists the details (cast, crew, etc.) as being that of the classic ""Alien Predator"", the actual product this page is selling is a boxed set containing 'Day of the Triffids', 'Graveyard Tramps', 'Track of the Moon Beast (featuring a man named Johnny Longbone), and the classic 'Little Shop of Horrors', NOT included in this box set, which is collectively titled ""Alien Predators"", is the actual FILM ""Alien Predator"". Buyer beware.

On that note, ""Alien Predators"" is a cool little b-horror movie, and it would be nice to actual see it on DVD. Although you'd laugh your way through most of it, there are actually a few scenes that are kinda' creepy.",1152403200,6,935,4.736196319018405
7992330,4,B00009PJTI,"Alien Predators is a mixed bag for sure! Disc #1- Side A- The sci-fi classic DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (beware, some later editions of this collection have replaced triffids with the lesser ""killers from space""). Giant carnivorous plants attempt to take over the world after blinding the vast majority of the populace (with a strange meteor shower). Can a small band of sighted heroes save the day?  Side B- LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. All about a giant carnivorous plant (named Audrey Junior) and the boy who loves it. A Roger Corman masterpiece! Disc #2- Side A- GRAVEYARD TRAMPS (aka: INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS). Mutated ""Bee girls"" attempt to take over the world by... um... er... well, mating their male victims to death. Meanwhile, the head Bee girl is busy making her hive bigger. Lotsa nudity and laughs a plenty! Side B- TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST. A lunkhead gets beaned by a meteorite, which turns him into a murderous, reptilian psychopath. His girlfriend sticks by him anyway. Will true love prevail? A schlock fest. This double disc is definitely worth the cheap price! Don't miss it...",1067040000,9,1087,4.81283422459893
