2644098,5,B000HWY60G,"Not only is this great for lymphadema, draining your lymphatic system, it's also good for streching tight muscles in the chest and arm area after breast cancer surgery, and its a nice light workout as well.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone suffering from lymphadema due to breast cancer surgery and lymph node removal.  It' kind of corny and it looks like it may have been made back in the 80's or early 90's, based on the style of sneakers everyone was wearing, but it really does the job and I always feel so much better after having done the exercises.",1325548800,8,559,4.524752475247524
2644099,2,B000HWY60G,"I am a yoga teacher, and specialize in yoga for breast cancer survivors. I heard of the Lebed Method and thought I could pick up some great tools for teaching. It was very basic, not really what I was expecting for a therapeutic dvd?",1298160000,,233,4.318181818181818
2644100,5,B000HWY60G,"After bilateral mastectomy with many lymph nodes removed, I developed lymphedema a few months after surgery.  I wish I had this DVD then because it takes you thru a routine of very effective moves to get the lymph system moving.  It took me a very long time to find a lymphedema therapist because they are few and far between.  I might have been able to skip that mad search, only to get a therapist who was just awful, and didn't teach me proper self-massage.  Then, had to hunt for yet another therapist.  This program works, but you have to be willing to pop the DVD into the player and actually do it to the best of your ability on a regular basis!",1268092800,19,652,4.311475409836065
2644101,4,B000HWY60G,"As a certified lymphedema therapist, I was interested in learning more about the Lebed method, and have already started incorporating these moves into the exercise programs I give my patients. After seeing this DVD, I am thinking about getting certified in Lebed method. I would highly recommend this DVD to people with upper or lower extremity lymphedema, and those treated for breast cancer who are at risk for developing lymphedema.  The exercises are slow, safe, and effective and the instructor has a positive, upbeat attitude that it makes it fun. Also includes instruction on diaphragmatic breathing to stimulate lymphatic duct, and the importance of wearing compression while exercising. I hope to see this DVD become a series!",1236470400,21,735,5.282051282051282
2644102,4,B000HWY60G,Slow paced arm workout for breast cancer/lymph node surgery survivors.  Relieves pain and tightness through exercise. Those confined to a chair would also find the workout out useful.,1235952000,15,183,5.535714285714286
8141770,5,B000HWY60G,The exercises are gentle and can be done standing or sitting. Ive done them once and some of the pain is gone! Fun too,1524614400,,118,3.9583333333333335

8141773,4,B000HWY60G,OOPs I thought I bought a BOOK not sure how I ended up with the disk. Having said that I expect to get the book now because I like to make flash cards up for doing my excercises and these are lovely and probably helpful. I know..copy right laws forbid it. Well no they do not. For your own personal use you can copy all you want. You can not sell or use in classes where someone paid to take it etc. But for little ole you...and so for me I make flash cards for my routines because I can take those outside in summer on the back patio and excercise or camping etc. I'm not subject to be stuck with a DVD routine or machine or even a BOOK. So I am glad I got the DVD and even if I do not get the book I will write and draw up my routine for flash cards use and be happy. I know a few people fault this for not being more specific or more challenging. The thing I think the author and producers wanted to get across you do not need to push it or cause pain to be helped by this routine. They don't even recommend you do it daily but are happy to have you choose 1 to 2 to 3 times a week. I intend to do it more often than 3 a week because I have an advance condition. Any and all help I can give myself is telling my self I care too. I would give it 5 stars had it been produced just a bit better. I could not hear the lady who often shouted out things from the back of the class. I would like to understand that. So sound production was not well done. Or had the lady not shouted out either would have been better recieved. I am sure they intended her to do so if not scripted in and so it would be nice to hear her encouragements or quips but could hot usually understand them do to poor sound pick up. Though it's low quality production that is less an issue for me but might bother others. I probably would over look that because the content is pretty good and so if they remake this perhaps they can either remove the back ground shout outs or make them so they come through to be enjoyed by all. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.,1442534400,,2030,3.8822115384615383
8141774,5,B000HWY60G,"Excellent, perfect, fun. I feel so much better physically and emotionally afterwards.  Atleast once a week!",1441756800,,107,5.6875
8141775,4,B000HWY60G,A very effective resource. I got results the same day. I'm certainly committed to continue to use the DVD.,1411516800,,106,4.631578947368421

8141777,5,B000HWY60G,"This is a very gentle movement program, intended to move lymph fluid at the speed and in the direction it's supposed to go.  It is also great for improving and maintaining shoulder/arm flexibility and range of motion (ROM).  There is a balance segment too.  Exercises can be done sitting or standing, and both approaches are well-illustrated throughout.  The background is drums or older pop music.  Not a glitzy production.  It manages to be upbeat, while being low key and relaxing at the same time.  I started using it after a few months of physical therapy (PT) for axillary cording and a frozen shoulder.  It consolidated and extended my gains from PT.  I did the moves the best I could at first.  Once I started, I was soon able to pull a tee shirt off over my head (finally!), which I attribute to the overhead moves performed to ""Dancing Queen"".  I am now done with PT, but I still do this program every day to help maintain ROM and because I like it.",1398643200,4,959,4.517441860465116
8141778,4,B000HWY60G,"She is fun, encouraging - and the exercises are simple, yet, they make sense on how they would stimulate the lymphatic system.  It goes quick, and I feel better.",1352505600,,161,4.551724137931035
8141779,5,B000HWY60G,"An all around feel good fun way to get moving again. This DVD is for ""regular"" people that just want to heal better. Also, the group in the DVD have all been there and you feel connected to them. Way to go!!!",1343433600,,208,3.9761904761904763
