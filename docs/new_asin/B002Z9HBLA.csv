4014198,2,B002Z9HBLA,"First off, ""Attack on Leningrad"" is a very misleading title. Long drawn siege would be better. The action scene on the cover is also very misleading. At the start there is a battle scene redone from ""Enemy at the Gates"" and some CGI Aircraft bombing but that is only for about 15 minutes of the whole movie, this certainly is no ""battle movie"". More accurate would be to have Mira Sorvino lying in a bed huddling to children trying to stay warm.

This is a Russian film trying to bring the story of Leningrad to life with a cliche script exploiting on some sort of ""Horrors of War porn"" without brining anything new or even being interesting. Into the plot are drawn a myriad of characters with thin and uninteresting stories and a sub plot about the Stalin regime. Added to this a completely unneccessary view from the German side and a love story.

On the whole the film felt as if it was trying so hard to cater to everyone and completely forgot to be interesting for someone.

Not that the siege of Leningrad isn't worthy of a good story. It certainly is. Its just that this story isn't good, just moves along in an unengaging way. Possibly worth watching but hardly a keeper and even then it is never a must see.",1277596800,6,1217,4.424107142857143
4014199,5,B002Z9HBLA,"A bitter-sweet story of Leningrad blocade presented from historical perspective of KGB activities and beliefs in the US journalists assistance (whish was rather mistic feeling of then locals) as a doughter of anti-Bolshevik tsar army general, born in England but speaking no Russian, shared a fate of her people during barbarous time of Nazi Germany seage of this city.

A quite naive story (an original tytle is Leningrad) provides a touching info of harsh conditions only Soviets were able to overlive.

Poor subtitles-both contextually and size leave plenty to improve.",1276473600,2,572,5.344444444444444
4014200,5,B002Z9HBLA,"This movie should really be called the siege of leningrad.  It's more about the siege that killed a million and a half people than a battle movie.  It features the true story of a british raised women who was born in russia who goes back as a journalist.  Few women in those days were risking their lives as war correspondants.  The film is pretty grim and actually the real seige was far worse than even they show in this movie. Which does show how some people were reduced to cannibalism, but most people starved to death or froze to death. OF course others were killed by bombs. Hitler was going to level every russian city , and so he cared nothing for the great culture of st petersburg (aka Leningrad) thank god they don't call it that anymore!  The film focuses on kate w and a family she tries to survive with in the siege.  The film does give you real glimpse of the horror of 800+ days of horror and siege, with frozen bodies lying everywhere, in stairwells, on floors , in buses , on ships. most people became to weak to move them. And a over a million bodies piled up.  Mira Sorvina really does a great job in this movie and the russian actors are excellent too. gabrial byrne also does a fine job as a brit journalist as well. This movie thankfully doesn't add things like a hollywood movie would , like suddenly the lead character in this utter horror finds true love! or such. So it's true to the sacrifice of the siege and of the real woman it tells about. The effects are pretty good , although they have me 109 fighters bombing leningrad which is not the case. They used stukas and such with the 109's straffing people and animals as well.  This movie needs to be released in blu ray here in the states. The company that has put this one out has also put out alot of war blu ray titles. great ones like 'katyn' , 'assembly"" , and 'flame and citron""
they are all foriegn language movies and so is this one. So yes you must read subtitles but who cares! It's good for your brain.",1275609600,7,1995,4.287234042553192

4014210,3,B002Z9HBLA,"The American version deletes many powerful scenes that are in the international version (German, Russian, English).  So this American version lacks much of the richness and desperation of the longer version.  Since the subtitles are fairly good, though not exact even in the American version, I recommend watching the international version.  The basic plot of course involves the longest siege of WW 2--Leningrad, which lasted over 800 days and cost the lives of 1,500,000 civilians and nearly a million soldiers from both sides.  This movie is unusual in that the two lead roles are women, one Russian and one English, both very strong while still remaining feminine in the face of great adversity.  The picture on the front of the DVD box is misleading--the real star of this is the Russian cop, Nina.  I think that Mira Sorvino's part was put in primarily to grab a non-Russian audience.  The relationship between Nina and Katya (Mira) is both complex and one of the few remnants of humanity in terrible, perpetually worsening conditions.  Subplots are well-done and do contribute to the main story line.",1477958400,11,1107,5.043956043956044

As I toured the surrounding opulent summer palaces I heard discussions from the guides of the Nazi occupation and the surrounding of the city in September 1941 leading to a 3 year siege of the inner city.  This film is based on a true story, shot on location, is one of a very few docu-dramas on the event.  The film is shown through the eyes of a foreign journalist who has a unknown secret identity which complicates the plot and adds a conflicting drama to the historical story.

Although the cast is meager, Mira Sorvino, Academy Award Winner, turns in one of her best performances as this journalist.  Actual scenes are shot on iconic city locations, even the Nazi occupation in the rooms of the summer palaces appear so.

The biggest problem, in my view, is that Gabriel Byrne and Mira Sorvino are simply too old to play ingenue leads.  At the end of the film, Gabriel Byrne is playing something like his true age. For most of the movie we are supposed to believe he is around thirty, at most.

There are numerous other problems, also mentioned by other reviewers.  The screenplay was poor. The story was unrealistic...would the Russians really have been tracking the daughter of a White Revolutionary from thirty years as a suspected spy during the siege of Leningrad? Doubtful.  And again, she is just too old to foster any sympathy.

The actress who plays the young female soldier is a whiff of fresh air, but the rest of the movie sinks. Even the children are a bit cloying. The end of the movie is supposed to be a tragedy, but we find we don't care about what's happened to two of the leads.

4014282,4,B002Z9HBLA,"I recommend Attack on Leningrad (2009) to anyone who is interested in World War II movies.  I give the movie 3.5 out of 5.0 stars, which I rounded up to 4 stars.

Strengths

- The story is extremely important and needs to be shared.
- The film exhibits the cruelty of war and the inspiring courage and resilience of the Russian people.  1.5 million civilians, half the city's population, died in the siege on Leningrad, the worst such loss in history.
- The cast, including Mira Sorvino, Olga Sutulova, Gabriel Byrne, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and two children, turn in good performances.
- It appears the budget was adequate for the subject matter - it has an epic feel.  My very-rough guess is that it cost USD 25 million to produce.
- The cast and dialogue in English, German, and Russian give an international feel, where Hollywood often fails.

Challenges

- The CGI was weak for a 2009 film.
- The dialogue was not always fluid and natural.
- There was uneven character development.  For example, a sympathetic German pilot that could have added depth feels phony and out of place in the movie.
- There was some weakness in continuity - at times I was not completely sure of where characters were and how much time had passed.
- The film compares unfavorably with stronger World War II films such as All Quiet on the Russian Front (1930), Casablanca (1942), Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), The Longest Day (1962), and Schindler's List (1993).  It is not as highly-produced, realistic, deep, or sweeping as these films.

4014292,2,B002Z9HBLA,"Let me start by stating that I am sort of an expert on this subject specifically and the Great Patriotic War (WW2 in the East) more generally and I have always looked forward to the Siege of Leningrad being portrayed in film and brought to a wider audience outside of Russia. Well, this isn't it. To my mind, the Siege of Leningrad is one of the most dramatic and gut wrenching tales of WW2 and one would think that there would be many ways that someone could bring this story to life and bring that drama across to an audience, but the script and the directing, the actors and the acting - argghh! - it all comes off so ""made for TV movie"". In all fairness, it was a made for TV movie produced for Russian audiences, and it included a couple of notable American actors too. However, it is so stale, so contrived, and photographed in that rather bad made for TV style that it screams all the way from beginning to end, ""I am not a serious motion picture"". I was gravely disappointed, so much so that I did not make it all the way through the first time watching it. That was how utterly un-engaging the story was. Some months later I forced myself to watch it all the way to the end. It didn't get any better. There were moments where the film almost lived up to expectations - when it focused on the war elements and the siege itself, but where the film tried to portray the human elements of the character leads, which are used as a narrative device to drive the story, it really fell flat. I am not going to pick apart each of the individual performances, but suffice it to say that they were not believable given the context. The female Russian lead was especially bad, and Mira wasn't particularly good either. Hair and Make-Up get particularly bad marks - at no point does anyone in this film look like they are starving to death, on the contrary, in most instances they look like they just got out of the shower and are ready for a day at the office. When you see the children of one family whose story we follow it is just downright laughable, in that they are supposed to be on the edge of death, but they look better than me most mornings! And much that made the siege a horrifying nightmare is absent here or glossed over. I doesn't even look that cold, the weather is generally pretty nice throughout the film - it was one of the nastiest winters of the 20th Century. The criminal gangs and cannibalism are barely touched upon. The film does not do a good job of conveying the building sense of impending doom and the resulting desperation. In fact the most desperate scene that I can recall - that was believable, mind you - was a truck and driver breaking through the ice on Lake Ladoga. They managed to pull the driver to safety, in case you were wondering. I desperately hope that one day this story will be told, but for now you would be better served by sticking to the written accounts.

4014301,4,B002Z9HBLA,"This is a war film about the struggle of the citizens of Leningrad to defeat hunger when Hitler and his forces surrounded the city and tried to starve it to death.  Some of the scenes are harrowing - when, for example, some Russians are slicing off pieces of meat from a live horse...there is even worse horror to come.

But this movie should have been stronger.  I felt that the performance by Mira Sorvino was weak - as a beautiful blond journalist who is left behind for dead - yet takes it upon herself to care for two intelligent children when their mother dies.  The surprising star of the film is Olga Sutulova - as a young woman police agent with ferocious energy to help the journalist and fellow citizens which sometimes comes into conflict with her ""orders from headquarters.""

The best part of the DVD disk is actually the story of the making of the film and particularly the director's commentary.  He explains that for decades, the Soviet Union did not want a realistic film about the siege of Leningrad; the Party wanted the story to disappear.  The director takes the position that Stalin was partly complicit in letting 1.5 million people die (by not bringing more Soviet troops to oppose the blockade)  because Stalin distrusted the intelligentsia of Russia's most European city.  I did not know that so few films had EVER been made about the siege of Leningrad in Russia, considering that the event was a shattering, unforgettable part of the country's history in the 20th century.  I did not know that Stalin
went so far as to interfere with a memorial to the dead of Leningrad just after the war.",1321833600,3,1617,4.661971830985915
4014302,5,B002Z9HBLA,"Why five stars?  I watched this movie immediately after reading Harrison Salisbury's 900 Days.  I found the movie to be quite historically accurate, if The 900 Days is accurate, which I presume it is.  I was gripped and engaged emotionally by the movie.  I felt that it gave a sense of what it must have been like in Leningrad in autumn 1941 and winter 1942. This movie had the best--coldest, snowiest--winter scenes of any movie I can recall.

In response to some other reviewers:  Of course the actors did not look like they were starving.  They can only do so much in a movie.  Tom Hanks did not look sick enough to have AIDS either in Philadelphia.  There are natural limits to what actors can do.  Also, a lot was left out of Attack on Leningrad.  The siege lasted almost 900 days but the movie only takes place during the first (and worst) part.  Again there is only so much that can be portrayed in two hours. You know, unity of time and place, etc.

One thing that no one else mentions is that this is one of the few movies in which all the main characters and heroes are women.  I would say of the movies I've seen, this is the finest portrayal of women, their courage and engagement.  For this alone I would give it five stars. The very first scene, during the credits, is an amazing portrayal of a woman's courage and domination in combat.  She pulls a gun on a hesitant officer and threatens to shoot him if does not lead his men in a charge against the Nazis.  They do get out of their trenches and drive back the enemy only to be routed by oncoming tanks. Again, this scene itself was worth five stars. I have never seen anything like that involving women in any other movie ever.  There are several other scenes involving the same female character being active, engaged, and heroic.  But also feminine at times.",1321142400,53,1826,4.413173652694611
4014303,3,B002Z9HBLA,"There is a split around this film with reviewers and I can see why, I initially felt this film was plodding a bit too slow, but it does try to deal with what was one of the worst sieges in modern history, in terms of the human casualties. Then it gets things historically wrong, such as using Mescherscmitt ME 109's to carry out the bombing (without bombs in the under carriage) which is just rubbish and was done using CGI so they could have done a real bomber. The characcters do lack real development, but there are some good performances, ostensibly by the children and everyone does look too well fed, but it might be asking a bit much of 'extras' to go without food for 6 months just for arts sake.

They did finally deal with the alleged canibalism and also the activities of the NKVD, but it did feel a little too revisionist with feigns at the emotional heart tug scenario, which just failed to come off - Schindlers List this most certainly is not. That said one of the reviewers here has said that 'Enemy at the gates' is a betteer film, I beg to differ as it has that talentless clothes horse Jude Law ruining an above adequate plot and is so historically inaccurate that it could have been written by the Polit Bureaus propaganda department. If you want a good real Russian WWII film try 'Star'.",1320537600,18,1308,4.427385892116183
4014304,3,B002Z9HBLA,"I really wanted to like this movie because there's needed to be a great movie done about the seige of Leningrad for many years - unfortunately, this isn't it.  The opening battle scene in the trenches outside the city occurs as the opening credits are rolling, and that is the ONLY battle scene in this entire movie.

The movie is entirely centered on the first winter of the seige, not the entire seige itself, just those first six months or so; that was kind of a disappointment.  Being a stickler for historical accuracy, there are a lot of flaws in the movie from a historical perspective - far too numerous to name here.  The portrayals of the German officer staff are very simplistic and short scenes.  The German logic of settling into a seige is completely centered on the mentality of the Germans to simply starve the city to death, and this point is made over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over (you get the point) throughout the whole movie.  It is not portrayed that the landscape around the city was so bad it restricted German troop movements, then once winter set in, they simply decided not to continue the attack because casualties were too high.  The actual history of what led to the seige is ignored and instead, it's all about bread - literally.

There are some very poorly done CG animation scenes shown repeatedly through the movie of Messerschmitt 109's bombing the city (interestingly while they're NOT carrying any bombs) and you see the same piece of CG animation used in all of these scenes.  Needless to say, the 109 was not a bomber and wasn't employed in this role.  Then there's the issue of a Luftwaffe pilot who cannot handle the thought of all the starving civilians and does a Kamikaze dive into an anti-aircraft emplacement to end his personal angst - had a little trouble with that.

The story centers around a female police officer and her relationship with the British/Russian journalist who was left behind in the city after mistakenly being counted as killed in an air raid.  I don't have a problem with that story, it's not bad, there is some chemistry between them, but that is 90% of this movie's story.

On the plus sides - the film makers did do a superb job of making the frozen hell of Leningrad in that first winter look very authentic - I just wish they had come up with a story to match the epic sets and authentic scenery.  They did a superb job on getting the Soviet and German uniforms and equipment correct, and, while they did convert a couple of T-34 tanks into clumsy-looking German Panzer IV's for the opening scene, there is one scene where a legit Panzer 38 is used, motionless, and presumably taken from one of the Russian museums (I don't recall seeing a legit Panzer 38 in any other movie before).

Nit-picking, the whole story revolves around the citizens of Leningrad starving to death and freezing, but, none of those dropping dead from starvation look emaciated in any way - I had a bit of a problem with that too.  All through the movie, there are 5'5"" tall 180 pound women keeling over from starvation!  Freezing to death I could understand, but not hunger; not in that first winter.  They also do not deal with the large-scale German artillery barrages of the city, which were much more of an ordeal to the populace than air raids.

On the whole, the movie's worth getting for the money, simply because nobody's done anything better on this subject yet.  It is typically Russian and it's better to watch it in Russian and use the subtitles, as the voice-overs in English sound really strange and the lips don't sync well with the sound coming out.  Worth getting, but just barely.",1320364800,8,3677,4.60030627871363
4014305,4,B002Z9HBLA,"'Some fight. Others fall. All are heroes.' ATTACK ON LENINGRAD as written and directed by Aleksandr Buravsky does indeed address one of the longest and costliest sieges in the history of war. History books relate it as follows: 'This was undoubtedly the most tragic period in the history of the city, a period full of suffering and heroism. For everyone who lives in St. Petersburg the Blokada (the Siege) of Leningrad is an important part of the city's heritage and a painful memory for the population's older generations. Less than two and a half months after the Soviet Union was attacked by Nazi Germany, German troops were already approaching Leningrad. The Red Army was outflanked and on September 8 1941 the Germans had fully encircled Leningrad and the siege began. The siege lasted for a total of 900 days, from September 8 1941 until January 27 1944. The city's almost 3 million civilians (including about 400,000 children) refused to surrender and endured rapidly increasing hardships in the encircled city. Food and fuel stocks were limited to a mere 1-2 month supply, public transport was not operational and by the winter of 1941-42 there was no heating, no water supply, almost no electricity and very little food. In January 1942 in the depths of an unusually cold winter, the city's food rations reached an all time low of only 125 grams (about 1/4 of a pound) of bread per person per day. In just two months, January and February of 1942, 200,000 people died in Leningrad of cold and starvation. Despite these tragic losses and the inhuman conditions the city's war industries still continued to work and the city did not surrender.'  Buravsky made a tough decision in this film - whether to sow all the tragedy of a grand scale or reduce it to an examination of the effects of this heinous event as it affected the lives of a few characters.  He elected to choose the latter approach which is one reason this film stands tall among the many films about the Siege of Leningrad.  Yes, there are reenactments of the battles at the beginning of the film (and the atrocities throughout the film) but Buravsky focuses on three cultures in the form of individuals - the Russians, the Germans, and the British - and is careful to present the extremes of all three groups in telling his story.

The time is 1941 and Kate Davis (Mira Sorvino) is a British journalist who pleads with fellow journalist Philip Parker (Gabriel Byrne) to be assigned to the war front.  She succeeds and is assigned to Leningrad where very quickly she is separated from her confreres and is left, wounded, inside the city of Leningrad as the Germans attempt to destroy the city and conquer Russia. Kate speaks little to no Russian, is discovered by Nina Tsvetkova (Olga Sutulova), a member of the Russian resistance, and takes Kate to safety where she becomes friends with children Sima and Yura Krasko (the brother is severely handicapped), manages to write articles about the war around her when she receives a typewriter as a gift, and in general aids the Russians in surviving the lack of food an supplies and support.  The film includes vignettes of the Nazi's involvement (meetings with Hitler as portrayed by Eckehard Hoffmann and Armin Mueller-Stahl as von Leeb, et al) and the Russian military and political groups to keep the action plausible.  But by far the main point of the film is to honor the citizens of Leningrad as they struggled to survive - with some caring help from the outside.

The film is in Russian, German, and English with subtitles; the choice is solid for keeping the atmosphere but the mix of the three languages seems to stall the propulsion of the action in many spots.  The screenplay is more concerned with depicting the sense of the event than it is in providing a dialogue of sophistication. But the actors make the best of the script: Mira Sorvino, Gabriel Byrne, and Olga Sutulova are strong enough to carry the film.  This may not be the best of the films about this subject, but it is certainly one of the most successful depictions of the degree of human suffering war inflicts - and for that reason it is worthy of a larger audience.

During WWII the Nazis planned to take Leningrad on their march to take over Russia and the world. They are met with resistance and the battle begins. Kate Davis (Sorvino) is a foreign journalist and is on her way to be evacuated with everyone else when she is hit. Thinking she is dead the plane leaves without her. This movie opens with a spectacular war scene that while not that graphic it is still very powerful and memorable. Then the movie shifts to the dramatic side and follows Kate from her life of safety to struggling to stay alive. This movie shows the power of the human spirit and how in times of need you find who and what you need to make it through. A pretty movie true story. The main problem is that it tends to drag in a few parts and is a little too long. I don't mind long movies but if there are parts that are not needed they can be taken out to make the movie's pace a little better. Other then that I recommend this movie. Overall, a good yet slow account of Kate's struggle for life in a country ravaged by war. Much like the movie ""Winter In Wartime"". Which I though was better then this one. I give it a B-.

It might also put off people who like films about human endurance because they think it is a zap, bang, wallop - bags of soldiers killing each other film. The sub plot of the German pilot was very unnecessary too.

However, the story of endurance - the reporter trapped in the city - the starving people she is housed with and the Soviet police woman are the central part of the movie. This worked for me and was only spoilt by what is mentioned above. I thought the film had a compelling aspect to it concerning the police woman and reporter.

I have to say I was extremely disappointed by how poor this movie really is. I wasn't expecting a big budget epic but I wasn't expecting such uneven, disjointed, half-hearted and poorly scripted movie. Add to it the sub-titles are poorly done, far to small and very dim (I was watching this on a 47"" lcd TV and had a very hard time reading them) and at times both in Russian and English.

The CGI effects are bottom dollar BAD, the overall special effects are pretty hoaky. The planes all seem to be flying at the speed of light and can turn and dive on a dime which is pretty bad. Battle scenes are corny and poorly staged (the hand to hand combat scene near the beginning of the movie is really comical), the Panzers do not look anything like the real thing.

Now the acting, I always liked Mira Sorvino but she is pretty horrid here (though in the beginning of the movie she looks amazing in that red dress!!!). Her attempt at an English/British accent is really rather comical, it is so bad (just like her entire performance). Gabriel Byrne could not have given a more wooden performance. On a positive note the performance given by Olga Sutulova as Nina the Cop was terrific.

I did like some of the historical aspects represented in the movie. The trek on Lake Ladoga to find out if the ice was solid enough was interesting. But overall no way could I recommend this movie.

4014309,1,B002Z9HBLA,"Awful, ham-fisted attempt to put onto film a subject that has been long overdue. The near 900 day siege (or snippet thereof) of Russia's second largest city during World War II should be the ideal premise for an engaging drama, but unfortunately this Russian/British co-production fails on many levels. It isn't interesting, dramatic, correct or entertaining. It also isn't well directed (Aleksandr Buravsky) or acted for the most part, despite having personalities like Gabriel Byrne, Mira Sorvino and Armin Mueller-Stahl in the cast.

The basic story is about Kate Davis (Sorvino), a British journalist reporting from Leningrad, who by circumstance is left in the city when the siege starts in earnest. She seeks shelter with a Communist official, Nina (Olga Sutulova) and a Leningrad family. Together they try and avoid starvation and German bombs, in the hope of getting through the ordeal alive.

However, everything seems uneven, disjointed and somehow half-hearted which is a dreadful shame as it was possible to make a good film with the material at hand.

Other failures include appalling clich&eacute;s, terrible dialogue, silly sub-plots and some ill-fitting post-production dubbing. Notoriously absent are the Finns, who were responsible for the Northern sector on the Leningrad front and also few and far between are scenes of cannibalism, which was rife throughout the city. As well as that, every bombing attack is carried out by smiling German pilots in BF109 fighters, rendered in sub-par CGI and there are moments of supposed drama and tension that actually made me laugh out loud!

There are some good points, though. The opening scene is rather well done, even if the German panzers are woefully incorrect and the idea pinched from 'Enemy at the Gates'. The Russian and German characters speak Russian and German (for the most part anyway, the Russians can speak incredibly good English when needed!) and Olga Sutulova's performance as the Communist militia (Nina) is rather well done, dwarfing everybody else. Unfortunately, it's just impossible to ignore the film's shortcomings and simply enjoy the story as the amateurish inaccuracies and terrible script (right down to the last scene) invade the enjoyment so overwhelmingly.

War is hell...

8384505,5,B002Z9HBLA,"Anyone who seriously wants to know about 20th century history ought to consider seeing this film.  The siege of Leningrad by the Germans during WWII was as brutal as any siege I can think of during the war.  There are some familiar American-British-Irish actors/actresses in the film, including Mira Sorvino.  Ms. Sorvino does a very good role in the film as a journalist whose parents were ""white Russians"" (i.e., anti-Bolshevik) and she is covering the war for a London newspaper.  Her love in the film is a well-known actor in British and American films...beyond this, I felt the strength in the movie was not in any individual portrayals, and familiarity with leading stars can detract from what the film is about--in this case, the virtual starvation of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) during the German siege.  The Russian parts are all well played, the set dressings are good and believable, and you can suspend reality long enough to immerse yourself in the experience of a brutal siege, daily bombings, etc. Even some morals are portrayed on the German side, although briefly.  I recently saw a good distinction drawn between ethics and morals, which is useful here--an ethical man doesn't cheat on his wife because he knows he shouldn't,  a moral many never thinks of cheating on her.  The film is replete of course with starving people who must make moral decisions daily--or are they ethical decisions.  When it comes to starvation, one can see that dilemma being part of daily life in Leningrad.....

It is a well-made WWII drama.  I could do without using the hammer and sickle being used to replace the ""G"" in Leningrad, just as on often sees
the letters "" and "" misused in titles to give the title a ""Russian feel"" which is usually so very far off it is offensive to someone who knows a Cyrillic language.  If anyone in the film industry reads my review, I encourage the cessation of this practice, much as it shows cultural ignorance.",1515888000,,1950,4.8053892215568865
