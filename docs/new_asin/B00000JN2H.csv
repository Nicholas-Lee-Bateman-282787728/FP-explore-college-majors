1234784,3,B00000JN2H,"Petr Weigl deserves praise for his bold experiment, a combining of the rhetoric of Schiller with the lyricism of Donizetti to achieve something higher, a Shakespearian heft in the telling of the sad tale of the Scottish queen, Mary Stuart.  Unfortunately, the tale as related does not transcend the soap operatic, and this despite the beautiful voices of Sutherland, Tourangeau and Pavarotti.  The end result is essentially no more than vintage melodrama. The characters parade past the viewer as if on stilts. The combination  of the  rhetorical and the lyrical emerges simply as doubly pretentious in the unfriendly (because realistic) medium of film. The director's intention was fascinating.  It is too bad that the resultant film is no more than mediocre.",993254400,7,760,5.24793388429752
1234785,1,B00000JN2H,"This DVD is of Maria Stuarda is in fact a film, which is a... of Donizetti's opera.  Dramatic scenes and arias arechopped and changed around at will, with huge chunks of music missing,suddenly interspersed with German dialogue.  This is bad enough; whatis worse is watching ... eastern european actors and actressestrying ... to lip synch to Joan Sutherland's magnificentvoice.  The makers of the film didn't even specially record thesoundtrack, they just lifted directly from Sutherland's full recordingof the opera.  I would recommend anyone to steer clear of this....",983836800,10,570,5.443181818181818
1234786,4,B00000JN2H,"It helps to watch and listen to this excellent production open-mindedly. If you are the kind of ""opera buff"" that cannot tolerate any other versions but the absolute original, please skip this recording. I enjoyed it tremendously! The different languages and dubbing did not worry me as much as I thought it would. As the work progresses, you get so involved with the wonderful acting, the costumes, the locations, the singing etc that the anomalies disappear completely. I wanted to cheer aloud at the end!
A wonderful production!",975715200,4,531,5.045454545454546

1234788,5,B00000JN2H,"I BEG TO DIFFER WITH THE OTHER RATHER PESSIMISTIC REVIEW!  I FOUND THIS PRODUCTION STUNNING IN EVERY WAY, THE SETS ARE PROBABLY HAMPTON COURT IN ENGLAND, THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH DID INHABIT. AND THE COSTUMES ARE NOT ONLY  GORGEOUS BUT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE. THE LIP SYCHING FOR BOTH THE SPOKEN  GERMAN DIALOG, AND ESPECIALLY THE ITALIAN OPERA SINGING IS FIRST CLASS!  AND WHAT VOICES, SUTHERLAND, PAVORITTI, AND TOURANGEAU WHO HAS THE DEEPEST  FEMALE VOICE I HAVE EVER HEARD!  I FOUND THE WHOLE PRODUCTION ENCHANTING!",955584000,6,514,5.2073170731707314
1234789,1,B00000JN2H,"The film attempts to combine Schiller's play with Donizetti's opera. The target audience may be opera lovers who grew up in countries where Shiller is taught and revered in highschool. The Czech actors are dubbed in German  for the dialogues and in Italian by the Decca recording of the opera, for  the sung scenes. The film starts with 15 minutes of an exceedingly tedious  dialogue in German. Watching the Czech actors proceed from dubbed spoken  German to the dubbed voices of famous singers in Italian is absurd beyond  belief. The whole thing has the logic of a Monty Python sketch, and casts  some doubt on director Petr Weigl's artistic judgment. The audio and video  quality are excellent.",951523200,18,697,4.905982905982906
7912751,5,B00000JN2H,"Of the approx. 300 opera DVDs I own, this is one of my favorites. The singing, the acting, the staging is outstanding. In the very beginning of the first viewing it, I had my doubts about this rendition, but once I got ""into it"" (suspending my preconceived notions) I was fascinated.  A wonderful, successful experiment in my view.",1419897600,,331,4.706896551724138

7912753,2,B00000JN2H,"Anyone expecting Donizetti's opera will be bitterly disappointed.  This mish-mosh is neither Donizetti nor Schiller, but an unhappy, forced marriage of the two, with snippets of the opera used as what can best be described as ""incidental music.""  To give Milan Knazko his due, the film is visually gorgeous, but for opera fans it really isn't enough. I would give this two stars -- five for the visuals and one for the overall whatever this thing can be called.",1396137600,,461,4.822784810126582
7912754,5,B00000JN2H,"My opera discussion group has just considered Maria Stuarda.  The general consensus was that this production was the most interesting and best production available on DVD.  Admittedly it is neither the opera nor the Schiller play, but it is a very interesting dramatic juxtaposition of the two.  And it is important to remember that the Donizetti libretto is based on the Schiller play.

This is a Petr Weigl movie production.  As with his others, he demonstrates a superb sense of place, costume and drama.  The music he has chosen is sung by Sutherland, Turangeau and Pavarotti at the height of their powers.  His actors by singing and speaking during the filming while the soundtrack is playing have mastered the lip-synching, and as usual are superb actors who look their part.

There are a few times when the insertion of the Schiller drama is intrusive (the sellf-immolation during the final scene comes to mind), but mostly it enhances what is going on.  The Fotheringay scene cannot be bettered, and the confession in the final act sends shivers down my spine every time I see it.

I realise that there are a lot of purists out there who have almost visceral negative reactions to this production.  I have a positive one.  Give it a try with an open mind.  It is well worth it.",1290211200,7,1285,4.7342342342342345
7912755,1,B00000JN2H,"If you think this is a complete performance of Donizetti's ""Maria Stuarda"", think again.  It's nothing of the kind.  I'm not even sure WHAT this is.  Scenes from the opera are mimed by actors -----to  the recording,  no less, of  Joan Sutherland-Hugette Tourangeau on London Records.  Both sing spectacularly well, but in this context, it makes no effect whatsoever.  One is far better off just purchasing the recording on CD.  I cannot speak for everyone, but I find this to be a complete failure of an attempt to combine two mediums.  By such halfway measures, nothing is accomplished.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it a zero, which is exactly what it is.",1111190400,7,714,4.715447154471545
7912756,2,B00000JN2H,"Bloodless bland facial expressions and body language as accompaniment to deliberately emotional full-body singing is a disconnect I don't find appealing.  Just letting your mouth hang open as long as a note is held does not convey the fire or the ice of the musical content and intent.  Yikes.  This is painful to watch when these two genres -- Italian opera and German dramatic play -- are mixed, but never really blended.  I'd rather watch a too-old Sutherland and an un-English Pavarotti impersonating their characters through music than watch actors impersonate characters while impersonating singers.

It all comes across hollow/empty/fake/contrived to this viewer/listener.  This is a hybrid that thankfully cannot reproduce itself.",1098144000,9,738,5.544642857142857
7912757,4,B00000JN2H,"In his film about Donizetti's Maria Stuarda, Petr Weigl used large excerpts from the 1975 Decca recording of that romantic opera with Joan Sutherland, Huguette Tourangeau and Luciano Pavarotti, Choir and Orchestra of the Bologna Teatro Comunale, conducted by Richard Bonynge.
A reviewer took Madame Tourangeau for an Australian dramatic soprano. This is incorrect. Huguette Tourangeau is an authentic mezzo-soprano, and she is not Australian, but French-Canadian. She was born in Montral, Qubec in 1940. She studied piano and singing at Le Conservatoire de musique in Montral with Ruzena Herlinger and the conductor Otto-Werner Mueller. She made her debut under Zubin Mehta's baton with Mercedes in Carmen in 1964. The same year she had a first fruitful contact with Richard Bonynge at the Stratford Festival in Ontario. The next year, she toured the US with the Metropolitan Opera singing the title character in Carmen. Later, she was to sing with Dame Joan Sutherland and her husband, conductor Richard Bonynge, several important mezzo parts like Alisa (Lucia di Lammermoor), Orsini (Lucrezia Borgia), Elisabetta (Maria Stuarda), Unolfo (Rodelinda), Hua-Qui (L'Oracolo), Parsis (Esclarmonde), Maddalena (Rigoletto), and several others. In June 1974, Huguette Tourangeau joined Joan Sutherland for the inaugural season of the Sydney Opera House in Australia. Whence perhaps the mistake about Madame Tourangeau's nationality.
In 1977, Madame Tourangeau became the first recipient of the Canadian Music Council's artist of the year award. Her magnificent voice is a flexible mezzo-soprano adaptable to the wide range of the mezzo repertoire, from Rossinian coloratura to the robust sound required by the trouser roles of German opera or the lyric mezzo of the French heroines. (Gilles Potvin, Encyclopedia of Music in Canada). She has been teaching voice in Montreal since 1984. Here, in Qubec, all opera lovers are very proud of Madame Tourangeau's brilliant career worldwide.",1089763200,6,1976,5.59
7912758,2,B00000JN2H,"This is not going to work, not even foor opera fans. This is  a play done with real settings, yet with a lot of dialogues and suddenly the actor/actress sing an operatic aria and then cut short and then another scene...
Sutherland and Pavorotti singing was not as good as one would expect-- we can't see their acting, and nd the sound is not so good in any event. The costume is, however, very good, so is the photography. Acting is not bad. But where is the drama,the climax or anti-climax...It's the form it takes that causes the audience most trouble.
One would accept an opera with real setting like Onegin with music written by Tsaichovsky etc more readily.",1052697600,3,662,4.563025210084033
7912759,1,B00000JN2H,"This is not a performance of Donizetti's opera. Scenes from the opera (sung in Italian) are interspersed with scenes from Schiller's play (spoken in German). The result is ... well, I don't know what name to give to the result. Petr Weigl has made some pretty good opera films, and some pretty awful ones, but this one takes the cake as the worst trashing of an opera ever committed to film. It doesn't do much for Schiller's play, either. The singing (what there is of it) by Joan Sutherland, Huguette Tourangeau, and Luciano Pavarotti is very good (Weigl obtained a pre-existing sound recording of the complete opera and sliced out the little bits that he needed for his film), but there's not enough of the opera or of the play for any music drama or any other sort of drama to happen. Avoid this DVD and buy the CD set of the opera instead. If you're interested in Schiller's play, just read it.",1029715200,14,899,4.521472392638037
