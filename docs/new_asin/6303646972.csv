7852249,4,6303646972,"Tony Little is a goofy man, likes to make his workout fun and keep you inspired. This video is intense and well directed.  Tony uses a member to ensure your movements are correct and if you stay focussed and committed, the workout pays off with great definition.  The first time I did this tape, I felt it for two days.  It gets easier with repetition, but it definately targets the prime areas of buttocks, upper and lower legs.  If you have a playful sense of humour and are looking for real work, this is a great tape!",981158400,10,521,4.34020618556701
