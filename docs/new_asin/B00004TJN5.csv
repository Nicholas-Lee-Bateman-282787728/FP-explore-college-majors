7922818,4,B00004TJN5,"Without giving away the story, the synopsis is as follows: Yoni was born in 1958; and a few years later he was joined by his two  younger brothers, making a family of 5. His middle class family grew, as did the State of Israel.  They celebrated the holidays, and in 1967, they were caught up in the euphoria of the State's 6-day war victories. So much so that in Purim 1968, Yoni and his brothers dressed up as the recently captured Wailing Wall and a fleeing Palestinian. It is at this Purim party that the movie opens and jumps ahead 4 years to Pesach 1972, after Yoni is expelled from school for failing all his courses. The film follows Yoni and his family over the next 2 weeks as Yoni seeks refuge from his family, his American born mother, and in particular, his bullying (or is he?) father, while he tries to overturn his father's decision to banish Yoni to an all-male, 'military-focused' boarding school in Rishon.
