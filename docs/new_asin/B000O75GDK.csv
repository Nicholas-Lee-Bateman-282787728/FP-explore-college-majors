For those out there who don't own the staggeringly wonderful newline  Box Set....this is a great intro...if you find yourself wanting more after this...that's the place to go..and if this turns out to be a curiosity..you saved big bucks.
The quality of the prints isn't quite up to the big box set standards..but generally they are pretty good,  certainly miles ahead of the kinescopes of  50's TV  if that helps.

2791152,5,B000O75GDK,"This is  a choice selection put together by none other than Harold Lloyd himself.  It makes for great entertainment as a movie alone,or if you want to single out a particular episode.  What really defines Lloyd against other greats is his pearilous stuntwork - particularly his routine up many stories high on a painter's plank as he struggles to get to saftey.  A gem.",1128038400,9,369,4.71875

2791155,5,B000O75GDK,"I remember this show coming on when I was young, repeats of course. It's silent film and awesomely hysterical. I showed a clip to my students when we talked about the invention of the moving picture and silent film. They laughed and laughed ... and 6th graders are a tough crowd. I recommend this to everyone of every age.",1352505600,,322,4.47457627118644
2791156,2,B000O75GDK,"I was very disappointed in it, because I was looking for some complete episodes, not snippits of them.  I had hoped to get 'Hot Water' and 'Safety Last', but only got bits of them.  Also, I was not impressed with the fact that there were no itemizations on the preview on the amazon website.

We did enjoy the videos we saw, and it just made us want to see all the episodes.  I just can't afford $36 for the whole thing, and even if I buy one on your site, I have no idea what episodes are included on each one.",1351555200,,511,4.02970297029703

2791158,4,B000O75GDK,"Harold Lloyd was a great comedy star, and this CD is entertaining.  I thought it would contain one or two of his films in complete form, but was surprised that it is a lot of short segments from various movies, grouped under several headings like ""Surprise,"" ""Thrills"" and ""Action.""  It is still good and includes scenes from a later movie with sound.  Just be aware of what how the presentation is organized.",1276041600,5,409,4.652777777777778
2791159,5,B000O75GDK,"I discovered Harold Lloyd one night when I turned on Turner Clasic Movies and saw a hilarious 30-minute sequence from the movie ""Feet First.""  I have shown that sequence to my husband, grandchildren (6 & 8) and sons and wives (in their 30s and early 40s), and everybody loves it.  So I was happy to be able to buy a sampler of funniest scenes from Harold Lloyd movies, rather than have to watch the entire movies to see the funniest parts.  This DVD was perfect.  I gave it to my husband for Christmas, and the whole family laughed and laughed.  Good therapy.

2791160,5,B000O75GDK,Good snapshot of Lloyds films. After viewing a film on TV I knew I had to get this and share it with my son in the military to share with his buddies.  Good clean fun!,1262995200,5,167,3.7714285714285714
2791161,4,B000O75GDK,"Encouraged by the popularity of Robert Youngson's silent-comedy compilations, Harold Lloyd (who owned all his films) assembled this 1962 anthology. A moderate box-office success, ""World of Comedy"" includes classic moments from the bespectacled genius: iconic clock hanging in ""Safety Last"" (1923); the inventive jail escape in ""Why Worry?"" (1923); and the ""get to the church on time"" climax in ""Girl Shy"" (1924). Oddly enough, there are sound sequences from ""Feet First"" (1930), ""Movie Crazy"" (1932) and ""Professor Beware"" (1938)  which suffer in comparison to the golden age of silence. For many years, this 94-minute collection provided film buffs with the only access to Lloyd's work.",1257379200,20,687,5.542857142857143

8183188,5,B000O75GDK,"If you are a fan of Harold Lloyd, or just want to see how comedy got its start from brilliant comedians, this is a keeper.  Had me laughing and gasping in my seat.  This even entertained a 6 and an 8 year old despite their first nose turn up at ""it isn't in COLOR?""  But once they got into it, they asked questions about background attire, buildings, autos and the like.  (Look what cars used to look like!  They delivered MILK?  With a horse???)  It was not only hilariously funny, but it was very educational and held the kid's interest...for about an hour.  Held my interest through the entire DVD for several nights worth of very enjoyable, relaxing comedy entertainment.  I'll be watching this over and over for all the subtle nuances.  You get more out of each segment every time you watch it.  Amazingly, Mr. Lloyd didn't use stunt men, did his own stunts, and didn't die doing it.  Bet his Mom didn't know what he did for a living....",1410393600,2,942,4.444444444444445
