3437869,4,B0019KAQB8,"Good film but I was expecting for an other kind of documentary, I mean, more general about energies and not so particular as it is presented.",1286064000,2,141,4.461538461538462
3437870,5,B0019KAQB8,Part of my hope for changing policy and amunition for the fight for a gree world,1283904000,,80,4.0625
3437871,5,B0019KAQB8,"This was a great dvd covering the many ways we as a country can go green with renewable resources.  It covers solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, wave motion, bio fuels, etc.  Great view.  I think we all need to buy this and send it to everyone who is in the ""good ol' boys club"" of big oil and big coal.",1277251200,9,300,4.0508474576271185
3437872,5,B0019KAQB8,"This is an excellant DVD! It shows with some great real applications that pv panels, wind turbines, greothermal, and other renewable energy sources are ready technologies... We can free ourselves of dependance on carbon polluting energy sources and foreign imports. Live free and not die !",1259971200,8,289,5.304347826086956
3437873,4,B0019KAQB8,"Most environmental messages are all about doom and gloom.  This work says we have resources from the air, ground, water, and other places to replace fossil fuels.
I can't stands me no chemistry or physics, but the science here was bearable because of the good news that was being spread.  I still have concerns that these fan blades in the air or in the sea are going to kill wildlife and put many species on the endangered list.  This work did focus on warmer areas.  So it's nice that Arizona and Ethiopia can cultivate all this energy.  But are we sure that cold, bustling places like London or New England are going to be able to take advantage too?
This work is novel in that it speaks of past peoples and cultures using the same technology.  For example, the windmills in Holland were about energy.  Native American tribes in the Southwest positioned houses so they would soak up maximum sun.  I loved the history lessons here.
The work seemed to interview Ph. D.'s and Joes the Plumber.  So it is a bit diverse in terms of class.  However, it was very homogenous in terms of race and gender.  Remember when the Internet was all the rage in the 1990s, but there were serious worries about the ""digital divide""?  I am worried that this new, clean, infinite technologies are going to aid the privileged and not the oppressed.",1226102400,5,1329,4.561181434599156
8274216,5,B0019KAQB8,Very informative.  We really like the Modern Marvels series.  There's lots of good information in each episode.  We would definitely recommend this.,1406073600,,148,5.636363636363637
8274217,5,B0019KAQB8,I teach 6th grade science and we were studying renewable energy resources. I have always been please with History Channel productions in the past so I decided to purchase this one. It gave my students a look at an alternative future for energy and made them see the impact of fossil fuels. Overall this is a great one to purchase.,1396828800,,330,4.516666666666667
8274218,4,B0019KAQB8,"The problem : The Energy Crisis
The solution : New Ways to Produce Cheaper Endless Energy
Well since last century the problem continues to hunt us.
When will this new technologies be implemented all over?",1395878400,,204,4.857142857142857
8274219,4,B0019KAQB8,Good DVD which covers various renewable resources. Ideal as a visual backup in class and also as a source of knowledge,1393718400,,118,4.666666666666667
8274220,4,B0019KAQB8,"Although it is an ""older"" DVD, the""Renewable Energy""  abundantly depicts green- technologies employed  by other governments. By what is lacking, it is a dramatic reminder of the failure of the USA to take seriously, the threat of global warming.  Because our US ""corporatocrary"" places profits for its ""protected"" (polluting) industry giants above planetary survival, our political leaders must be judged by their failures in accomplishing any reasonable impact on the world's emerging disasters. Only Jimmy Carter made a gesture by installing solar panels on the white house, which were promptly removed by Ronald Regan.  This DVD is an historical perspective and  testimonial to the failure of the US government to make any meaningful contribution to avert what is the imminent demise of the planet.",1389657600,,801,5.42741935483871
8274221,5,B0019KAQB8,I show this video to my students when we cover fossil fuels and renewable energy sources and they all remain engaged throughout the showing.  It uses good computer graphics and real life footage of renewable energy being used around the world.  Definitely recommended!,1389312000,,268,5.209302325581396
8274222,4,B0019KAQB8,"A good video for introducing people and especially students to the arena of alternative/renewable energy.  I use it in my electronics classes with a worksheet I made, and the students learn a great deal. A good value for the price.",1386288000,,231,4.775
8274223,5,B0019KAQB8,Very interesting and educational. i did learn a lot. I did learn a lot about renewable energy and how can we hel to save the enviroment with it.,1377302400,,144,4.178571428571429
8274224,5,B0019KAQB8,I like getting these types of videos as we are living in times when new ideas are needed.  I have seen the wind farms and love watching them.  They are so quiet!  I like the ones along the Columbia River best.  You don't expect them there.  There is more information than just wind covered in the video.  It is very thought provoking and good for young people to look at what is going to be in their future.  My next car will be a hybred of some kind.,1363132800,,451,4.056818181818182
8274225,5,B0019KAQB8,"This is an excellent video. I use it with my program Science for Seniors which is an activity program for retirement, long term car, assisted living, and adult day centers. The program tells in a fun way how science works in e everyday life.
