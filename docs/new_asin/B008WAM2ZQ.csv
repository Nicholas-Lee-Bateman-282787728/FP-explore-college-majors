========================================

BEHEMOTH

In the Great Northwest the Walsh family's patriarch seems to be going crazy with his blathering on mythical prophecies about some colossal beast awakening and creating havoc. Meanwhile there are ominous geological signs that something earth-shattering may be occurring. The local authorities finally take heed and give the word to evacuate. The problem is the beautiful Walsh daughter is camping with her fianc on the mountain, which is the focal point of the catastrophe. Her older brother and a scientist girlfriend go to the mountain to save her. There's also a government agent investigating things. All hell breaks loose literally.

""Behemoth"" combines the plot of ""Dante's Peak"" with countless monster-in-the-woods flicks, so this may not be the most original film out there but it's well done for what it is. Where it scores high marks for originality is the cause of the disaster, the behemoth itself. Most monster-in-the-woods flicks feature creatures about the size of Bigfoot, e.g. the many ""Sasquatch"" flicks, ""Goblin"", ""Man-Thing"", ""It Waits"", ""Carny"", ""Prophecy"" ('79), ""Gargoyles"", etc. Not so here. The creature in ""Behemoth"" is indeed a behemoth -- so huge, in fact, that it literally sleeps/lives inside a mountain!

Some have complained about the appearance of the monster as goofy and badly done. I don't get this. I think it's pretty cool looking -- a multitude of tentacles, malevolent head, gaping maw. What do you expect for low-budget CGI?

""Behemoth"" was shot in Squamish, BC. Although this is a dreary area (cloudy with lots of rain) it's exceptionally scenic!

The likable cast is a plus, particularly the Walsh family, but the ages are off. Ed Quinn as the main protagonist, Tom, is old enough to be Cindy Busby's father. Cindy plays Grace and is said to be 20 whereas Quinn is 42. The Walsh father is played by William Davis who's past 70. He should've played the grandfather and Quinn the father. Oh well, no big deal.

Like I said the cast is very likable and I like their closeness and love for each other. It's nice to have a group of people you can root for.

Another plus is the women. Cindy is gorgeous to say the least. If you don't know who she is imagine Lindsay Lohan if she were prettier, healthier and had better curves (instead of resembling a stick). The scientist, Emily, played by Pascale Hutton is also good. And then there's the girl-next-door, Zoe, played by Jessica Parker Kennedy, an obvious acquired taste.

Some have complained that the ladies scream in terror too much rather than doing something useful, but one of the main protagonists is the geologist Emily, who pretty much keeps her head at all times, so that blows that contention. Yes, Grace & Zoe scream a lot but a freakin' mountain is coming alive and destroying everything & everyone around them, including their loved ones. I think it's a fitting occasion to scream, don't ya think? Besides, screaming babes is a horror tradition.

Some complain about the slow build-up but this is par for the course for disaster/monster flicks, e.g. ""Dante's Peak"", ""Alien"", ""Prophecy"", ""Jaws"", ""Man-Thing,"" etc. Giving away the creature or crisis too early spoils the mounting crisis. Besides, the film only runs 90 minutes and so the build-up merely involves the first hour. Plus the creature is fully shown in the last act.

BOTTOM LINE: Don't listen to the grumps, ""Behemoth"" is a worthy low-budget TV creature feature. It has all the staples you'd want for a disaster/monster-in-the-woods flick, including a likable cast, gorgeous women, spectacular locations and an original monster.

GRADE: B

========================================

ROADKILL

With a title like ""Roadkill"" the prognosis wasn't very good, but ""Roadkill"" surprised me. The monster is a giant bird-of-prey, the mythical Roc, who preys upon a bunch of youths touring rural Ireland in an RV.

The movie combines elements of several films: ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" (flying creature attacking a bus full of youths) and countless other flying creature flicks like ""Carny"" and ""Wyvern"", as well as films like ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Dying Breed"" (malevolent hicks in remote areas). It also has a subplot about an old gypsy curse, which is reminiscent of ""Drag Me to Hell"". If you like these types of films ""Roadkill"" is as good or better.

What makes it ""as good or better""? For one, it's filmed on location in mysterious rural areas of Ireland, which sets it apart from most Syfy flicks which are filmed in British Columbia, Romania or Bulgaria. Secondly, it has a likable cast with a good assortment of gorgeous women. Thirdly, the CGI creature is well done for a low-budget flick, unlike say the cartooney cat in ""Sabretooth."" Fourthly, the material is taken seriously and never devolves into camp or goofiness. Fifthly, this is just a solidly made Grade-B creature feature. The filmmakers obviously took the time to make a quality product and this is seen in numerous scenes. For instance, the sparrow scene (you'll know what I mean when you see it), as well as the touching reflective sequences in-between bird attacks and the many atmospheric forest/moors images. I also like how the film touches on the human breaking point and insanity, which would certainly be a possibility (or probability) if this occurred in real life.

The first review of ""Roadkill"" on IMDb absurdly gives the film the absolute lowest rating possible (1/10), not to mention inexplicably gives away the ending (?!). What a moron. This reviewer refers to the youths as ""stereotypical beautiful college kids"" but, as far as the dudes go, I don't see any Brad Pitts, and as far as the ladies go, they're pretty hot, as noted above, but not unbelievably so. Also, despite the token minority they seem like a realistic circle of friends.

This reviewer also rags on the film for the huge RV, but this is a pretty big group of youths -- seven -- so the RV HAS to be big enough to accommodate them. Besides, we see huge RVs all over rural areas of North America, why would it be any different in Ireland?

BOTTOM LINE: ""Roadkill"" is a solid low-budget flying creature flick with a sideplot of ee-vil gypsies and is well worth your time if you're into these types of films. It's at least as good as ""Wyvern"" and I like it better than ""Jeepers Creepers 2.""

GRADE: B+

========================================

FEROCIOUS PLANET

A group of office people are accidently teleported to another world via an experimental device that opens windows to parallel dimensions. The forested world looks like earth but it's inhabited by ferocious beasts the size of dinosaurs. The group do everything in their power to survive and find a way back.

Before watching this one I fast-forwarded through it and didn't think I'd like it, but -- after viewing -- I have to admit that I enjoyed it for what it is. It's both a story of exploration (of the new planet) and survival. The former gives it a sense of mystery and the latter an air of tension.

There are a couple of good women, but they have office apparel on the whole time, which isn't a big deal; I just prefer women in cavegirl outfits in these types of movies, lol (like Beth Rogan in the 1961 version of ""Mysterious Island"" or Annabelle Wallis and Hannah Tointon in 2010's excellent ""The Lost Future"").

Most people seem to be attracted to this film because Joe Flanigan stars in it; having never watched ""Stargate: Atlantis"", this was my first exposure to him.

The film runs 88 minutes and was shot in Ireland.

BOTTOM LINE: This may be the least of the three and it's nothing to get excited over, but it is a solid Grade-B creature feature with a compelling survival situation and the anxiety and thrills thereof.

5187409,4,B008WAM2ZQ,"Maneater Triple Feature 7: Behemoth/Roadkill/Ferocious Planet is one of the best sets in the Maneater Series.  All three movies are better than many of the B movies by SyFy and other producers.  I like this set.

Scientist and the government are monitoring seismic activity in a mountain for different reasons.  The scientist have no clue what is causing it, but the government does.  When the mountain comes to life the only way to deal with the creature within is to go up on the mountain and recover the weapon a government team left there.  Decent cast including Ed Quinn (Eureka).  Good story, acting, locations and sets, F/X, and production values.

Six young friends decide to rent an RV and take a road trip in Ireland.  When they run over a gypsy in a small town she lives long enough to curse them to all be killed by a Roc, a monstrous bird from myth that was described in the story of Sinbad.  To make matters worse a girl in their group takes a medallion from the gypsies (one she actually bought, but they don't see it that way) and so the whole town comes after them with guns.  Great story, acting, locations and sets, F/X, and production values.  I would love to see a sequel where some people actully survive and maybe even manage to kill off at least one of a group of Rocs.  It might be interesting to see a unit of soldiers sent in to investigate the area since so many tourist have gone missing.

A senator (John Rhys-Davies, Indiana Jones) visits a Technology Lab guarded by Colonel (Joe Flanigan, Stargate: Atlantis) and his military team.  They have been invited to see an experiment with a cold fusion device that can view alternate universes, but things go very wrong.  The building explodes and pieces are hurled into an alternate universe.  The lab and all that were in it are fortunate to survive in a large section of the building that was teleported intact. The problem is the device will require water to work again, and the world they have landed on is inhabited by large ferocious dinosaurs.

Excellent story, good acting, great locations and sets, good F/X, and great production values.  My favorite in this set.

8531531,4,B008WAM2ZQ,"I love value packs.  This triple creature feature gives you that, three SyFy channel movies, and they're at least decent with ""Roadkill"" being a notch above the other two simply for the enjoyment it obviously takes in going through the usual forms.  All movies have some slight to moderate gore and are definitely not for the younger viewers, though nothing is ever too scary.  While I've rated these individually between 3 and 4 stars I give the value package that extra boost to 4.

I would encourage any potential viewer to start with ""Ferocious Planet"" which poses an interesting idea in the form of 'what if a tool that could look into other dimensions actually zapped a small portion of its dimension into another' but is otherwise a standard creature flick.  Then move on to ""Behemoth"" which, SPFX wise it has the least and is the weakest of the three, supplies a solidly conveyed though unoriginal story with a couple of nice story twists.  Finish it off with ""Roadkill"" for a feeling of late '80's killer creature and backwoods barbarity, all with its tongue firmly in cheek, a wink and a nod to its exploitative sources.",1411862400,2,1130,4.739795918367347
