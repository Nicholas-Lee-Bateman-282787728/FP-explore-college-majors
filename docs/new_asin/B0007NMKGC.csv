8049334,3,B0007NMKGC,"As it promises, this focuses heavily on singing pentatonic and blues scales. This isn't wrong, but it seems like it could have been covered in ten minutes or so before moving on to style-specific ornamentation techniques.  That might include breath placement in relation to the lyric, the growl that Etta James and others made famous (which can damage a voice if not done with care), slurring into a note, deliberately singing breathy for effect, and on and on.

Or harmony, like the different common 8- 12- and 16- bar forms. Or the validity of some oddball examples of 9- or 20- bar songs. Or lyric composition and structure ideas, like those described in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blues-Lyric-Formula/dp/0415974992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blues Lyric Formula</a>

8049336,4,B0007NMKGC,"I am not a beginner as far as singing goes, but I am changing genres from classical singing to jazz and blues. I wanted to know how to sing the blues well and do it justice. There were some things I didn't know, such as the blues scale. I liked the banter between the two on the video. Brings it some personality, but everyone is different. I didn't agree with everything said on the vocal basics side. That video is done by someone else who isn't really connected with the blues singing. But I think the blues side of the video was helpful to me as a musician trying to try something new.",1334361600,2,589,4.221238938053097
8049337,4,B0007NMKGC,"This DVD is an instructional that, at least for me, needed to be viewed a few times to really 'take'.  For the most part, it encourages the viewer to learn about some of the technical aspects of blues music (though the blues in general is not really a 'technical' form per se) but - more importantly I think - it helps one to get a 'grip' on the blues and to jump in, improvise, and take some chances with this music form.  To be sure, there are some who would argue ""blues is not something you really learn, it's something you _feel_ and express!"" thus meaning that a 'how to' for blues singing is unnecessary.  Though that might be true for some, I would not agree with that perspective, and for those who might prefer a more formal approach to learning the blues this DVD is a great place to start.

The DVD actually includes four volumes, the first two dealing with singing basics.  The latter two volumes directly deal with learning to sing blues music.

One point of interest: the lady in the video who is the principal instructor states several times that the blues is NOT about 'who' is singing or the delivery of the music, rather, it is simply about the musical scales used.  While I would agree that anybody can sing the blues (i.e., it is not limited to any group or social class), I would disagree with her de-emphasis on the delivery aspect of the music.  In my opinion, for blues to really 'work' well, there should be a certain level of conviction involved that differs from certain other types of music (e.g., happy-go-lucky pop music), and the delivery of the music is directly involved.

On a very minor note (no pun intended), the lady also states that blues legends BB King and Albert King were brothers - they were not.  While the two men were born in the same area of Mississippi (Indianola), they were not related.  The reason for the confusion is understandable, however.  BB King's father was named Albert King, and because he and BB (real first name Riley) were only 18 years apart, the father sometimes referred to his son as his 'baby brother' (but the BB is not for 'baby brother' it's for Blues Boy, which was later shortened to BB).  Still, the senior King was not the blues icon that the world knows by the name Albert King.  Albert King the blues man (whose real last name was Nelson) also sometimes claimed to be BB's half brother though this was not the case.

All in all, definitely recommended!",1323388800,7,2432,4.507972665148063
8049338,4,B0007NMKGC,"The banter in some sections can be downright annoying. I think this is an attempt to make it more entertaining, but if you are not a professional entertainer, stick to what you know. It is a lame attempt to make the video more colorful but simply fails and makes the tape seem less professional. Having gotten that out of the way, I think this is a very good resource for someone wanting to learn to sing the Blues. It has some very logical and useful exercises and approaches to understanding and executing the Blues. I do recommend it for these reasons. One thing to be aware of is that the keys are switched at some points between what I believe the piano player is playing and what the vocalists later sing, and this might confuse you so be aware that this will happen later in the tape. I thought that this could have been thought out, or at least explained, a little more professionally as well.",1284249600,2,901,4.433734939759036
