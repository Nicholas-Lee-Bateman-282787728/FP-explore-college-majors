1639046,2,B00005O5B9,"Part four in what is arguably this decade's finest educator-themed action franchise.  Treat Williams goes undercover in a Nazi military academy to root out the evil plot that lies within, battling an evil school commandant, brainwashed Nazi students, and a Korean guy whose presence is never adequately explained.  You'd think a movie willing to go with a premise that ludicrous would have to be entertaining, but most of it is pretty dull.  The movie tends to drag- there's far too many talky scenes about how much the evil white supremacist commandant (palyed by a sort of poor man's John Malkovich) hates atheistic multicultural liberals and not nearly enough action.  The ratio of liberal sermonizing to buttkicking is badly miscalculated.

It gets two stars instead of one for a couple of good action sequences (I especially liked the death by bulldozer) and the presence of Treat Williams, who's much too good for this sort of thing.  Overall, though, I wouldn't bother unless it's the only thing on cable- there's much more entertaining action fare out there.",1092096000,4,1066,5.062857142857143
1639047,5,B00005O5B9,"Wow. First off, I just want to say that this movie is truly a significant achievement in the history of filmmaking. Treat Williams stars in this thrilling drama, that sends a humble mercenary into the very heart of a Neo-Nazi conspiracy. Set in the late 1990s, our mercenary-hero (armed with high-explosives and a Ph. D. in modern literature) becomes a substitute at a military academy, only to discover it's been overrun by Nazi-thugs and a world-class exterminator! Peppered with mega-buck special effects (including a scene where the intolerant Nazis blow up a minority-owned power plant), this movie proves itself to be a treat (no pun intended) for the eyes, as well as the soul. You'll truly feel like you're part of the action as Treat crushes his students with a bulldozer, beats ass in the classroom with chalkboard erasers, and kills the Nazi-principal as he screams in desperation for ""racial purity"". Put the children to bed for this one!! ""Substitute 4: Failure Is not an Option"" will affect you in ways few films have. Its realistic portrayal of Nazism in academia is a chilling reminder of who's really in charge of our children's futures. Your life will never be the same once you see this film. Its title may seem cryptic, yet its message rings clear: failure is NOT an option!",1071273600,14,1294,4.85972850678733
1639048,3,B00005O5B9,"While it's not a bad movie, The Substitute 4 is the worst of the 4 Substitute movies. One of the main reasons is the film quality. The first 3 movies seemed to have better ""look"" to them and seemed like they could have been shown in a theater. This one looks more like a straight to video release. Some parts of the movie are slow, but it still has enough action to keep you interested.
Treat Williams is good as usual. Angie Everhart is OK - but I don't know why she was there, and some of the bad guys are pretty bad actors. The fight scenes are ok - even if they are a little predictable. A ""special effect"" explosion at a dam is pretty funny looking. There's some decent nudity, the classroom fight scene is funny, and a kid falling on some spike at the dam was cool too. The final battle with the bad guy was cheesy - and like the other reviewer said - why would a racist have a asian henchman?! The twist with Everhart is a little unexplainable as well.",993600000,2,959,4.161290322580645
1639049,4,B00005O5B9,"As a big fan of The Substitute series (which explains the four stars), I didn't think it was that bad.  Treat Williams gives his third performance as Karl Thomasson, and in this film he goes undercover(as usual) in a military academy to infiltrate a Neo-Nazi group.  Lots of action, hand-to-hand combat (only to be expected from the Sub), and Angie Everhart provides some pleasing eye candy.  If you're not too big on The Sub, this might not be the movie for you.  If you are, it ain't that bad.",987724800,6,495,4.52808988764045

1639106,3,B00005O5B9,"The Substitute franchise finally puts the end in sight.  Treat Williams offers no treat to this direct-to-video movie that has the former mercenary substitute teacher now infiltrating a military school which doubles as a training facility for white supremicists.

There was certainly a reason this was a direct-to-video.  While Williams acting is good. What he was given up work with wasn't. The writing was predictable and downright lame.  As the #1 reviewer already noted, the special effects, including the stunts, well, they were also downright lame.

So why continue to watch?  As the redhead said, ""Loneliness makes you do things you don't wanna do sometimes.""",1433462400,,666,5.295238095238095

1639126,4,B00005O5B9,"The first couple times i saw this movie it was on basic cable and even then it caught my eye with it's good dialouge, nice fighting scenes, and decent ending, so when i saw it on digital cable, and i saw the breif nudity, the sexual content, the vulgar violence, and the anti-setmitic language(and how they got what they deserve), to me, it made the movie even better, if you agree with me on one or all of these go and buy this movie",1292889600,,434,4.178571428571429

the substitute 1 to 3 where ok,  #4 on the other hand kind of sucks, compared to the other movies. adds up to be a movie that must have run low on money, like an old "" B "" movie.  save your money on this one",1226016000,,276,3.824561403508772
1639128,4,B00005O5B9,"The plot's odd, but maybe that's okay with you. The fight scenes are well done, but maybe you don't care about that. The dialog is not wretched, and the directing's quite good. All in all, as a movie, probably a 4 if you like this kind of thing, a 2 if you don't, a 3 on average.

What kicked it up a notch for me is that it was filmed at my high school alma mater, Woodward Academy. One of the good guy's gets killed right outside the room where I had english with Mrs. Hudson. The administration building is actually a library built after I graduated. The head honcho (and lead bad guy) has an office in what's really the alumni building. Even the Woodward pool makes an appearance - three, actually.

Whereas on-location filming usually takes advantage of locations for outdoor shoots, and does the indoor shots in a sound stage, a tremendous amount of the stuff here was actually filmed inside at Woodward - in the hallways, an office or two, even a classroom.

So, for those of you who attended Woodward, forget about the plot and the other reviews of it. Pick up on the little things - like the school uniforms that closely resemble those of GMA (note: Woodward Academy used to be Georgia Military Academy), the skinhead's mascot (Werewolfs; Woodward is the War Eagles), and what appears in one shot to be a photo of Col. Brewster (who founded GMA).",1108339200,3,1355,4.5
1639129,4,B00005O5B9,"Treat Williams is back, still kicking [...] and asking questions later.  At this pooint I think most people now identify Williams as The Substitute considering this is his third outing as the mercenary with a heart of gold.  Once again he's lured into a deadly mission by an old war pal.  He seems to be a sucker for taking on these missions as charity cases coz he never gets paid.  Naturally the gig has him as a history teacher at a military academy.  He discovers a secret group within the school called the ""werewolves"".  The Werewolves are an angry white supremacist bunch who are in training for a civil war between black and white they believe is happening soon.  They like to run around and destroy property owned and supported by minorities.  The leader of the group(The always scary Patrick Kilpatrick) is also the commendant of the academy.  Big shocker there, huh?  Williams goes about his routine of wooing the leading lady, beating up at least one kid in the classroom(with chalkboard erasers!), being all round sneaky and saving the day with a little help from his friends.  His mission is to get his buddy's(the guy who sent him on this mission) nephew out of the Werewolves.  Being that this is a part 4 in a series it can't help but feel a little stale, but it deals with some scary subject matter(neo-nazis) and that makes it pretty solid and pretty interesting.  You'll like it if you like the others.  Personally I hope Williams does at least one more of these films.",1101340800,4,1489,4.633587786259542

We have the witty reparte during firefights (I especially enjoyed the we duck, they shoot, they duck, we shoot choreography), the requisite kung fu, the stylish leather jacket for covert reconnasance, the token deranged vet, and the homicidal frat boys, with their fearless leader. Oh, and the attractive subordinate female officer lusting after the hardened combat vet.
It has always baffled me how a director with a 12 year olds mentality can't find a military advisor for filming? Do they have any concept of reality, or do they just assume the audience is that stupid?

Violence, including kicking, punching, shooting, stabbing and explosions.

Amazon Prime sent me an email a couple of months ago and I added all four Substitutes to my Watchlist.
