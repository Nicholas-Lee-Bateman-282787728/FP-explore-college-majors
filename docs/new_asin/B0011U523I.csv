If you're wondering where the skateboard comes in, during the most ingenious scene, the submissive girl is tied to a skateboard.  I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not sure when I'll watch it again.  Buy it for a bachelor's party, and they will be talking about it for years.",1432857600,,348,4.492063492063492
8242303,5,B0011U523I,"Any skateboard fans out there who might gravitate to this title - thinking this flik could be another paean to the sport like ""The Z Boys"" &/or ""Lords of Dogtown"" will be in for a 'rude' surprise!  This XXX rated effort from lesbo fetish film maker extraordinaire: Maria Beatty 'opens' with about 5 seconds of 'skateboard action' then immediately cuts to the 'real' action involved in this crazed little foray into female B&D play between well known (in certain circles!) fetish performers: Gauge and Amber Rayne.

Altho the 'write-up' for this twisted gem alludes to some 'conceptual art-piece' babble - in reality this is essentially a straight ahead girl/girl BDSM scenario with dominant Gauge tormenting/pleasuring her, filmic, GF (Amber) for 60 odd minutes of super hot, kinky, sex play.

Due to the uni-sexual nature of the film there is no M/F penetration BUT many other objects are utilized & inserted - in this fully explicit erotic exercise by Ms Beatty and I predict that (kink-oriented) viewers (of either sex) will be 'satisfied' (as I was!) with the result. Amber Rayne is noted for her athletic bod and 'girl-next-door' cute looks and she really demonstrates her ability to 'take it' in this bent offering.

Oh - BTW - there IS a skateboard featured, but in a way that would have had those Dogtown Z Boyz panting!  Volcanic! - 'nuff said.",1386720000,2,1353,4.890829694323144
8242304,5,B0011U523I,"This film made me fall head over heels in love with the work of Maria Beatty. Hottest thing committed to celluloid since ""The Devil In Miss Jones""...or ""Towering Inferno"",for that matter...",1373241600,,189,5.129032258064516
