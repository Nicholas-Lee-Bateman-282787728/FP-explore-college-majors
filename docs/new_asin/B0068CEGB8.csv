4977631,5,B0068CEGB8,"disclaimer: I am a HUGE Fassbinder fan.

This movie was just really neat, cuz it had all the things I love about Fassbinder, but was also a sci fi movie. What a treat! It's weird and dated and stilted and... you just have to see it. If you like movies (like, a LOT), just try it. If you haven't tried Fassbinder... the only other director I can think of offhand that he reminds me of kind of is like Ingmar Bergman.",1336089600,,415,4.1234567901234565
4977632,4,B0068CEGB8,"In 1973, auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder (""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul"", ""Lili Marleen"", ""The Marriage of Maria Braun"", ""Why Does Herr R. Run Amok"") created his first sci-fi film ""Welt am Draht"" (World on a Wire) which aired on German television.

A common practice at the time for German filmmakers was to have a theatrical production which was then shown on television at a later time.  But for Fassbinder, he created several films for television due to him wanting his work to gain popularity in Germany and the fact that there were not as many places to view cinema in Germany at that time.

The film was broken down to two parts and was an adaptation of Daniel F. Galouye's novel ""Simulacron-3'.

""World on a Wire"" featured a screenplay adaptation co-written by Fritz Muller-Scherz (""Fiorile"", ""Belle's Paradise""), cinematography by Michael Ballhaus (""The Departed"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Dracula"") and Ulrich Prinz (""Martha"", ""Fear of Fear"") and music by Gottfried Hunsberg (""La Paloma"", ""Shadow of Angels"").

The film would star Klaus Lowitsch (""The Marriage of Maria Braun"", ""Cross of Iron"", ""Das Urteil"") as the main protagonist, Fred Stiller.  The film would star actress Barbara Valentin (""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul"", ""Martha""), Karl Heinz Vosgerau (""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum"", ""Knife in the Back""), Wolfgang Schenk (""Martha"", ""Effi Briest"") and Gunter Lamprecht (""Berlin Alexanderplatz"", ""The Harmonists"", ""Das Boot"", ""The Marriage of Maria Braun"").

While the film was enjoyed by those who watched it in Germany when it first aired or those who were able to find it digitally, the film was unlike Fassbinder's other films in the fact that it was a sci-fi film but it was also a television film that had been forgotten for decades, due to the fact that it was not featured on VHS or DVD.  Also, it was a film that Fassbinder himself, never really discussed much about when he was alive.

But the ""World on a Wire"" has been a film that received a cult following and fans acknowledge the fact that the film predates virtual reality and technology before there were films such as ""The Matrix"", ""Avatar"" and ""Blade Runner"".  In 1999, a loosely-based American adaptation of ""Simulacron-3' was created and was titled ""The Thirteenth Floor"".

While ""World on a Wired"" was screened at a film festival in 1992 as a 10-year anniversary film retrospective for the late Fassbinder, the film would receive a  complete restoration in 2010 for the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and various theaters around the world.

And now the film makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut in North America courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""World on a Wire"" makes its debut on Blu-ray and DVD and it's important for me to note that if you want the best version of this film, purchase the Blu-ray version.

With that being said, ""World on a Wire"" is presented in 1:33:1 aspect ratio and the film was shot via 16mm. According to the Criterion Collection, ""World on a Wire"" was supervised by director of photography Michael Ballhaus, this new digital transfer was created on an ARRISCAN film scanner in 2K resolution from the original 16 mm A/B reversal rolls; color correction was done on a Discreet Lustre system.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using MTI's DRS.

There was a lot of experimental filmmaking in order to achieve the look and feel of technology but also something different visually.  According to cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, there were time when they held a bunsen burner underneath the camera in order to get a certain effect.

The film presentation does have a high level of grain (mixed with noise) and while another company had released the film with DNR (Digital Noise Reduction), it's rather subjective to the viewer of whether or not they prefer it.  I haven't seen the Blu-ray version but for this DVD version of the film, the film does have a lot of grain but didn't notice any major problems such as intense blurring, softness, artifacting, etc.  I did notice a bit of saturation of a scene during the second half of the film for an indoor sequence.  But it's a short sequence that didn't ruin my viewing of the film.

While the film does look its age due to the clothing of the time period, it's rather an interesting film because it deals with a topic that still has relevance in today's modern society and our view towards virtual reality and technology.  We have had big production films take on the subject, may it be ""The Matrix"" or even ""Avatar"", but what I enjoyed about this film is how Fassbinder and Ballhaus were able to effectively use the surroundings and clever camera techniques and movements to delve into the character's psyche.

I was pretty impressed by what was accomplished in 1973 and how the film was edited.  It was a bit jarring and surreal, but I enjoyed the cinematography for this film.

As for the audio, audio is presented in monaural German with English subtitles.  Dialogue was clear and heard no problems with audio whatsoever.

According to the Criterion Collection, the monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 16 mm magnetic perforated reels.  Analog artifacts like clicks, crackle and noise-floor were removed at CinePostproduction Bavaria Bild und Ton, Geiselgasteig, Germany, using a digital audio workstation.  Additional restoration was done by the Criterion Collection, where clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD and crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

In the west, when one thinks about television films, most never equate these films to quality cinema.  They are films that are great for popcorn entertainment, never too deep, often contrived and kitschy.

But in Germany, television gave new German filmmakers a chance to show off their creativity but also a way to generate buzz about their films to a larger audience.

It's been written that Rainer Werner Fassbinder was a filmmaker who never sought to become an auteur, if anything, he wanted to be a popular filmmaker and wanted his work to be well-known to larger audience.  And while this film is classified as a sci-fi film and has your elements of the suave protagonist, beautiful women and even a few action-scenes, what separates this film from kitschy television films is that this is also a cerebral film.

Of course, with computers and technology and having had big-budget films on virtual worlds featured in films such as ""The Matrix"" and ""Avatar"" and also a plethora of video games, back in 1973, these stories were imaginative.

Supercomputer?  Aside from major corporations, computers were not in consumer's homes at this time.  Virtual reality, could you imagine for those not exposed to computer technology trying to fathom virtual worlds?  It may have seemed farfetched but when you watch this film today, it's quite amazing of how this film explores simulation but also exploration into sophism and philosophic aspects of the human mind but also scientific research.

So, when you think of teleplays or television films, they typically resonate around experiences that people are accustomed to or have read in their newspapers.  May it be love, courtroom dramas, police dramas, crime, etc.  And yet this film which predates ""The Matrix"" and ""Avatar"" was made in 1973 for television.

Suffice to say, it aired on primetime television and did well in the ratings.  But it was one of Fassbinder's films that was never released on video until its restoration in 2010.  Watching this film today, one can easily be in awe of what Fassbinder was able to create and bring to a televised audience.  Also, be in awe that this auteur created a science fiction film.

While I do praise the film for its storyline and for its clever editing and beautiful cinematography considering the budget that Fassbinder had in creating this televised film, the film is not perfect.  Sure,  the acting is good but definitely not great. The film is slow-paced but this is a film meant to take in slowly and watch as the character of Stiller begins to make his discovery and we see how his world is literally turned upside down.  He knows he is not a real human and that the world that he lives in is a simulcron.  But anyone who is close to figuring out the truth will be eliminated or deleted.

And while watching ""World on a Wire"", I was just amazed by what was pulled off in 1973.  While cineaste are familiar with Fassbinder films such as  ""The Marriage of Maria Braun"", ""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul"", ""Veronika Voss"" or his wonderful TV mini-series ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" and be entranced by how his films were written, how his films were shot and structured, even for a television film, Fassbinder was able to integrate that into ""World on a Wire"".

From utilizing special effects through clever editing and just capturing a world where there is conspiracy, a world written around simulation, one man's regression (and showcasing his evolving psyche) when he finds out the truth of his world, not only did I find ""World on a Wire"" to be a smart, classy and artistic film, I absolutely enjoyed it.

I loved the use of reflections, the eery music and even characters that seem unusual at times, it was as if we had a mixture of James Bond meets surrealism meets futuristic veracity.

While I have not seen the Blu-ray version of ""World on a Wire"", I am confident that the Blu-ray version is the one to get, and the colors and detail would probably be much more pronounced than the DVD version.  While there is considerable amount of grain and noise, picture quality for the film is good and it's monaural lossless soundtrack is clear and understandable.  Subtitles were easy to read and the DVD comes with a wonderful documentary plus an in-depth interview with scholar Gerd Germunden.

Overall, ""World on a Wire"" is a pretty good Fassbinder film.  While I am biased towards many of his other cinema work and enjoyed ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"", I am quite amazed by how well-structured this television film was, especially how smart and enjoyable it turned out.

You just don't come across television films like this as it is a rarity and when you do, you just want more of it!  I would imagine that the release of ""World on a Wire"" would make Fassbinder fans quite happy.  Also, the potential of discovery of more wonderful television films by Fassbinder and other German filmmakers, who knows what other exciting films have yet to be found and introduced to the public.

But on it's own, ""World on a Wire"" is a must-buy Rainer Werner Fassbinder DVD release from the Criterion Collection.  No need for big budget special effects, this 1973 TV film relied on structure, character development, wonderful cinematography and clever editing and in the end, Fassbinder was successful.

""World on a Wire"" is highly recommended!",1335571200,8,11788,4.948652770716827
4977633,5,B0068CEGB8,"This is a movie that I've been wanting to see since I was young, but, although it was made in my time, it wasn't readily available.  Alas, Criterion has finally released it, and I was so excited to finally see it!

Basically, it is a TV movie based on the early 1960s sci-fi short story by Daniel Galouye.  It's about an engineer who is caught not only in an ethical dilemma on how his machine that mimics reality should be used (for the good of people or for corporate greed), but he debates whether he is in a fabricated reality or a real one.  It is more, but I'm not going to ruin it.

The movie itself is an excellent adaptation of the novel MINUS the CGI effects (no flying cars, no futuristic city, no public-opinion polsters).  It is made in similar style to Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" Godard's ""Alphaville,"" and Barzyk's ""The Lathe of Heaven"" (or even, dare I say, ""A Clockwork Orange""). Many sci-fi fanatics may find this problematic, but I love these movies because it makes them more ""down to earth"" and more human (for lack of a better word) and less ""contrived"" and/or reliant on special effects to tell the story.

The Criterion version has restored Fassbinder's movie, with not only an outstanding digital transfer, but ""New English subtitles"" (as stated on the back).  I have only seen 1 scene in my life, and it was from a horrible copy!  Fassbinder may not be a name associated with sci-fi, but the movie has all of his traits found in other movies he directed: muscular men of different races, overly made-up women with large, blond hair, and give-and-take dialogue.  There's even a ""Lili Marleen"" bit!  Equally masterful is his constant use of mirrors (or any reflective surfaces, such as water) and windows.  It's fascinating to watch!  It is also somewhat slow-paced (not as much as Angelopoulos), and this may tend to turn casual viewers off (I'm noting this, because reviews by other about slow-paced movies are negative because of pacing, and this is something that many viewers have overcome or need to overcome).  I like slow-pace; It's not so slow that you are bored.  The story carries well.  Great use of music (Strauss, Greek folk, and Jazz/blues) and sound effects (screeches and such that heighten tension).  Great use of art direction, colors, editing, cinematography, etc.

I watched this movie AFTER reading the story, and, even without the special effects, the movie is on-target with its adaptation (there is some added and some changed, but it works!).  No pollsters, but Fassbinder molds the movie in such a way so that not having them doesn't really matter.

There is some female nudity, and, outside of the US or UK, this is normal for TV movies and foreign cinema - I am only noting this because the film has no rating on the cover!

There are some great features on the Criterion set, including ""Making of..."" documentary.  I'm more of a Herzog fan, but I've been revisiting Fassbinder recently (next on list: ""Berlin Alexanderplatz, which is also on Criterion and I have seen before).  It is a 2-disc set.  It's great to sit through the ending credits and chill to the soundtrack.

To repeat myself, it is probably NOT for the casual movie watcher.  This is Fassbinder, and if you don't like slow pacing, early 70s cinema, or made-for-TV movies (it doesn't ""feel"" like one at all), this movie will probably disappoint.  In my opinion, it is for those who study foreign cinema, and, especially, New German Cinema (this definitely fits the NGC German identity crisis philosophy), and, even more so, the cinema of Fassbinder.

Spin around in tandem on swivel chairs with a fellow viewer and enjoy! (It's a scene in the movie) ----  5 stars for film, transfer, and DVD extras combined.",1330992000,32,3729,4.755832037325039

  The only science fiction movie that German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made was this long-lost three-and-a-half hour long film made for German Television. It has traces of ""The Prisoner"" to it, along with influences of Stanley Kubrick, Kurt Vonnegut and Philip K. Dick. The satirical look at the futuristic world of computer technology was incredibly ahead of its time in 1973, and is a recently rediscovered gem for film fans to now experience on high definition Blu-ray.

  The film's storyline is simple, and even familiar in the sense that these themes have been touched upon by countless filmmakers from David Cronenberg to Steven Spielberg ever since. Fred Stiller (Klaus Lwitsch) is a cybernetics engineer who is responsible for the creation of a complex computer world of virtual reality cities and people. It is like Sim City, but the cybernetic people aren't aware that the life they are living isn't actually reality, but virtual reality which can be visited though a machine.

  When one of Stiller's co-workers dies suddenly, there are suspicions of foul play. As he investigates this mishap, a deeper corporate conspiracy is discovered, and Stiller begins to doubt his own existence and reality. There are hints that he may actually be living in one of the computer worlds himself, unable to trust the world around him. The labyrinth of computer worlds makes it impossible to know what--if anything--is reality. We follow Stiller on a mad escape from authorities who may very well be programmed to find and destroy him, as well as nearly every other citizen. As the most wanted man in his world, there seem to be higher powers preventing Stiller from finding the truth.

4977635,5,B0068CEGB8,"Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film in this newly released Criterion DVD draws immediate parallels to Fahrenheit 451, Franois Truffaut's nightmarish vision of a world without books.  Fassbinder's film is less openly allegoric, more rooted in a world where corporate interests align with science and technology run amuck.  It's especially chilling that a mere 28 years prior to the making of this 1973 film, Hitler's Gestapo performed the same type of eugenics experiments, and deployed the same numbering scheme on human ""units"" depicted in the film.  Fassbinder deploys the same rapier on journalists that he uses to skewer corporate tycoons, noting they seem more interested in helping themselves at a massive press conference feast than in unmasking the human experiments taking place under their noses.

There are several places in the film where Fassbinder could have imposed his vision and left the viewer in the dust, but he's always careful to continue the story thread, and thus  keep viewers in the loop.  His world is highly stylized, there are no wasted frames - nearly every camera shot is tinged with erotic undertones or duplicity in the making.  Fassbinder's film career was as tinged with notoriety as it was brief - this film is as good an introduction to his work as you will find.",1330041600,12,1296,5.084905660377358
4977636,5,B0068CEGB8,"Firstly, it should be noted that this is a Fassbinder movie regardless of genre so one would need to be receptive to his work overall to enjoy this. That said World on a Wire remains true to the novel:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simulacron-3/dp/1612420206/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simulacron-3</a>&nbsp;and although it expands on it stays within its frame work. Also there really is no need to contrast and compare to:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000HAB4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;as they are two entirely different films (both of which I enjoyed). However it is also true as regards science fiction that less can be more such as:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prisoner-The-Complete-Series-40th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000FOQ03C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prisoner: The Complete Series (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>
  The abject minimalism of early Fassbinder, Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog may not be for all tastes but it was purposeful not due to lack of effort. Fassbinder in particular generally had screen plays where the overall ideas and themes were more important than the individual characters. World on a Wire wasn't so much a foray into the science fiction genre as an expansion of his themes into the arena. The paranoia and claustrophobia of World on a Wire is true to the original novel but also to the social climate of Germany in the 70's with the ever present reality of the cold war and anarchism (which would be further explored in documentary form in:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Germany-in-Autumn/dp/B0043VUHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Germany in Autumn</a>&nbsp;as well as the decadence and excesses of the time. This was the perfect time frame to realize the novel as when it was written the internet was far from realization, at the time later films were made it was a standard part of society but at the time of the 70's advances in technology were both somewhat frightening and dehumanizing but also a fetish as in:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Machine/dp/B000007R1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man Machine</a>
 If you enjoy the genre Fassbinder and others created then yes this would be essential viewing. If not understand that the impression the film creates surpasses the plot but is one that you might want to be enveloped in so give it a try.",1328572800,18,2574,6.564705882352941
4977637,5,B0068CEGB8,"As a film buff, I have had a chance to see a number of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's works.  He was clearly a genius and I have enjoyed a majority of the ones I've seen.  However, I have never found myself utterly fascinated with any of the films as much as this one, World on a Wire.  It helps that I love sci-fi in all its forms, from escapism to more serious works.  This definitely falls into the latter category;  the film that it strangely most reminds me of is the original Russian version of Solaris (and fans of that film should definitely check this out).  It shares a (somewhat) slow pace, cinematography and visuals that are quite striking at times, and a quite serious examination of seriously fascinating material.  The story concerns a computer project in which a virtual world, complete with simulated individuals who don't know they're artificial, is created with the aims of predicting trends and needs of the future.  One leader of the project starts to have suspicions about the project and uncovers a conspiracy involving it.  The main twist of the film will probably be figured out by most viewers before the characters do.  However, I think for most viewers this will not hurt the film.  For me, even after several viewings, the film retains the fascination that it had the first time I watched it.  Most interestingly, the film's ending has become increasingly more intriguing, as my interpretation of it seems to change every time I watch the film.  All in all, a must watch for anyone who loves sci-fi of serious ideas.",1364860800,3,1542,4.708955223880597
4977638,5,B0068CEGB8,"This is a masterpiece. If you appreciate Fassbinder's films, this is amongst the very best. And it anticipates ""The Matrix"" by some decades.",1363910400,,140,5.130434782608695
4977639,5,B0068CEGB8,"Based on the American science fiction novel, Simulacron-3 (1964) by Daniel F. Galouye, World on a Wire is about virtual reality, world created inside a computer program, a pre-cursor to the Matrix. I believe this is the first movie adaptation of Simulacron-3, although there have been many sci-fi movies with similar themes since then. The Thirteenth Floor (1999) is another adaptation of the same novel (oddly, 1999 is also the year for the Matrix and The Dark City, another great sci-fi movie).

World on a Wire was made in 1972 for German TV. It is made of two parts each one is aboout an hour and half long. The movie has a very distinct visual style and atmosphere; the interior shots, camera angles, the locations, actors are very 1970 German.

I like this movie a lot because of its different style but it is probably not for anyone's taste. Even though the subject matter is sci-fi, there are no spectacular special effects or action scenes which are typical of Hollywood productions. However, I think the movie overall does a pretty good job of creating an eerie atmosphere and paranoid feeling of the world not being real.

I was especially amazed by how some of the scenes and ideas seem to be pre-cursor to the Matrix. For instance, the subjects sit in a chair with wires hooked up to their heads and they get downloaded to the computer world (you may think of that as the matrix) and if they want to exit the computer world, they use a phone booth. Sounds familiar?

I also like the love affair depicted in the movie; in my opinion it works so much better than the affair between Neo and Trinity in the matrix.

I recommend this movie for any sci-fi fan who can appreciate foreign movies with unique styles even if they lack CGI and spectacular special effects.",1361577600,14,1774,4.619047619047619
4977640,3,B0068CEGB8,It's perhaps best described as a somewhat interesting oddity that has resurfaced and worth watching for fans of the director's work.,1359072000,,132,5.333333333333333
4977641,5,B0068CEGB8,"WORLD ON A WIRE has all the trademarks of prime Fassbinder cinema. You have your Michael Ballhause cinematography, all reflections, mirrors, transparencies, and circular tracking. He's as much a part of Fassbinder's style, as the Serk stylistic references, the reappearing stock company, and the ironic wierdness that spreads over his films. Even tho its technically a Scifi film, since it deals with scientific inventions of the future, at no point would the imagery tell you this. Instead, you have this odd mash of 1940s costumes, with ultramodern settings. WORLD ON A WIRE examines a future where computers can approximate human behavior. One particular company (IKZ)has a mega-computer with about 11,000 of these simulated humans programmed into it. The hero of the film, STILLER, understands this world, and the company that runs it. Yet some upper management, like VOLLMER, who discovered an unbelievable secret about IKZ, mysteriously disappears. He's at a party talking to STILLER one moment, and gone the next. Not only that, nobody realizes he just disappeared except Fred Stiller. VOLLMER not only disappeared, but nearly all memory of him has disappeared as well. Meanwhile, the company IKZ tells Stiller to forget about the whole thing, and accept Vollmer's old job. Yet Stiller cant let it go, as he works to prove that Vollmer DID exist, he slowly endangers himself. Stiller suspects that IKZ had him bumped off, because Vollmer had made a startling discovery about IKZ right before he died.

Even before the audience knows whats going on, Fassbinder is providing you with all the information you need to understand the situation. The minor characters all exibit blank stares, and appear oddly perfected in their clothing, make up and demenour in a way that's not fully human. Many don't blink. When not engaged with conversing with Stiller, they just stand there. This is true creativity, when the only special effect needed to show a person isn't real, is the acting. Also, the soundtrack drones in the backround constantly, usually trite 1930-1940s type movie composistions. Emotionally, the music is out of context with the lead character's situation, tho it helps immensely in providing a sense of falseness to the film. When the lead character discovers, or asks questions that fall outside the strange laws governing this odd world, the trite classical soundtrack becomes loud feedback, frightening and jarring for the audience. Eventually, as Stiller moves closer and closer to the truth, these harse soundtrack bursts of sound become more frequent. The first half of the film finishes on this bizaare note, like waking up screaming from a nightmare, as the soundtrack feedsback. Then there's a sharp cutaway to the end titles, while Fleetwood Mac's ALBATROSE song plays. Part two begins with Stiller's discovery that he lives in a computer program. He, and his entire world, isn't real. (The paralells to THE MATRIX are obvious.) What he discovered, was that even tho there are computer simulations ""below"" the level of reality of his computer world, there are also worlds ""above"" his world, until you finally come to our REAL world. The second part centers around Stiller's detective work, trying to discover how to break thru to reality. And one person in his circle of friends is real, and will help him attempt to escape the computer program.

If we treat the scifi elements as abstraction, then the film fits comfortably into the avant guard style so often found in Fassbinder's work. Much of Fassbinder's ironic tone derives from lifting Serk's Hollywood mainstream film noir/melodrama, and placing it over strange, modern situations. (Chinese  Roulette worked that way, as did Bitter Tears.) I'm often surprised at how much Fassbiner reminds me of David Lynch, who also loves mystery, avant guard, scifi elements, and mixing the normal with the bizarre for ironic tonality. Both directors love to write their films, and both employ idiomatic cinematography to jar the viewer from complacenty. The Criterion edition is first rate, with an entire DVD and booklet devoted to deconstructing the work, and placing it in the larger context of Fassbinder's other films. Altho WORLD ON A WIRE is a bit slow paced, and even obvious, it doesnt detract. After you accept the seriousness of STILLER's quest to discover the dark secret of IKZ industries, then the movie will have hooked you in, as you wait for the plot to unfold. The lack of special effects to drive home the visual element of a future setting matter as little here, as they do in Tarkovsky's best Scifi work like STALKER or SOLARIS. The dialogue, music, and settings provide scifi cinema of the MIND, not scifi of CGI and special effects. In Conclusion: Fassbinder fans will LOVE the film, as will fans of Tarkovsky's scifi work.",1355011200,2,4817,5.1104060913705585
4977642,3,B0068CEGB8,"This 212 minute film, made for German television, was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's sole venture into the realm of science fiction. For devotees of Fassbinder, the film will be indispensable for understanding the development of his career. Others, however, may wish there was less Fassbinder and more science fiction. The director's much-praised use of mirrors as a stylistic device, for example, repetitively stretched over thousands of feet of celluloid, quickly turns into a tiresome fetish. It's like the work of a mediocre painter, whose characteristic trait is his own signature, broadly scrawled on every canvas.
Fassbinder's movie is considerably influenced by Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville--it even momentarily uses Godard's star, Eddie Constantine, for a brief interlude. Like its predecessor, World on a Wire employs the science fiction genre as a vehicle for a postmodernist allegory about alienation and paranoia. Godard's film was made at about the same time Franois Truffaut shot Fahrenheit 451, and it is easy to pick up signs of a rivalry between the two productions. The Truffaut picture, a detailed depiction of a future dystopia, was a traditional studio movie made in England on a big budget. Godard, however, remained faithful to his nouvelle vague origins, and made his film entirely on location in Paris.
Godard employed a premise that had shown up in earlier science fiction writing as well as implicitly in certain low-budget sci fi pictures of the 1950s (Invasion of the Body Snatchers and It Came from Outer Space): we are all already living in the future without realizing it. In his futuristic novel When the Sleeper Awakes, H.G. Wells writes of his protagonist, ""all about him the world was--strange."" The words could serve as a motto for any artistically successful science fiction film, and Godard brilliantly transformed Paris into a disturbing projection of a future in which all life is under control of the computer Alpha-60.
World on a Wire, based on a novel by Daniel F. Galouye, follows the Godard rather than the Truffaut model. It unfolds in the present, depicting how a super-computer has produced a totally simulated world, over which the programmers have total control--apparently. In the course of the film, it will come out that human beings are themselves only part of another simulation, controlled by the ""real"" programmers. Like Godard, Fassbinder does not rely heavily on gadgetry, and uses actual locations rather than elaborately constructed sets.
Yet the alchemy that occurs in Alphaville fails to take place in World on a Wire. While Godard's film has a considerable amount of humor, as when the hero talks of making his interplanetary journey from Earth to Alphaville in a Ford Galaxy, humor was never Fassbinder's strong point, and, as the action progresses, science fiction yields to the director's familiar masochistic scenario of a hapless individual being relentlessly annihilated by a hostile world, a story he told far more effectively elsewhere, minus the added confusion of science fiction.
Only in one episode, when the main character, played by Klaus Lwitsch, travels into the alternative world simulated by the computer, do we get the feeling of the strangeness science fiction requires. But otherwise we're watching a spaced-out version of a James Bond thriller, spiced up with campy digressions like a number staged at the Alcazar in Paris in which a lady performer reenacts the ending of Josef von Sternberg's Dishonored, a thriller whose narrative fabric is visibly unraveling as the ends nears.
About the DVD, there is nothing but good to say. As we would expect from Criterion, the picture quality is excellent, and the two disks contain valuable special features that will improve anyone's understanding of this unusual motion picture.",1353974400,6,3807,5.273476112026359
4977643,4,B0068CEGB8,"""World on a Wire"" (Welt am Draht) is a 1973 adaptation of Daniel F. Galouye's 1964 novel ""Simulacron-3"" by prolific director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, of the New German Cinema. ""Simulacron-3"" was among a number of post-structuralist science fiction works of the 1950s and 1960s that described simulated realities. ""The Matrix"" made that concept a staple of science fiction film in 1999, and audiences will be reminded of ""Blade Runner"" (1982) also, but ""World on a Wire"" seems to be the first cinematic adaptation with these themes. It was shot on 16mm film for German television and shown in two parts, for a total running time of 212 minutes. The film was restored for the Berlin International Film Festival in 2010, and this is the restored version. There is some grain, particularly in low light, but it only adds to the film's self-conscious artifice. There is a clear narrative break between the two parts, so viewers may also want to break there.

In 1970s Germany, IKZ is developing a technology called ""Simulacron"" for the Science Ministry, to be used in the public service. Simulacron creates a simulated reality populated by nearly 10,000 ""identity units"" who have the psychological complexity of real people. Its purpose is to provide a method of modeling human behavior over the next 20 years, so society's needs can be predicted. The director of the project, Professor Henri Vollmer (Adrian Hoven), is having a nervous breakdown, however. Soon after telling Chief of Security Gnther Lause (Ivan Desny) that he understands something that others don't, Vollmer dies. The company's CEO Herbert Siskins (Karl Heinz Vosgerau) promotes assistant director Fred Stiller (Klaus Lwitsch) to replace Vollmer. But, when Lause disappears and no one can remember him, and Siskins wants to rent Simulacron's services to a steel company for private profit, Stiller begins to descend into a madness similar to his predecessor's.

""Simulacron-3"" was set in the future, but Fassbinder set his adaptation in Germany's present, presumably so there could be no question that the film intends to comment on the present. The sets are populated by ugly vaguely Bauhaus-influenced furnishings, which I understand to be authentic to that period in Germany, with some faux Greek statues thrown in for camp, and mirrors on every conceivable surface, constantly calling the nature of the ""self"" into question. Are the characters real, a reflection, or a projection? Does it matter? The only futuristic devices seem to be the video telephones and the ""Simulacron"" itself. The film is definitely not technophilic. This is the only science fiction film that Fassbinder made. He was prseumably attracted to this material for its rumination on who is watching, and manipulating, whom. These themes are not expressed subtly. IKZ manipulates the characters in the Simulacron. The company psychologist keeps aquariums.

The acting style is unnaturally subdued and strangely stilted, except for our protagonist Fred Stiller. Stiller is a archetypal noir protagonist, and ""World on a Wire"" is a textbook example of sci-fi noir. Stiller comes to the realization that he is living in a world that is chaotic and which he cannot understand. He tries desperately to understand it, obsessively tracking down any evidence of Lause's existence, desperate to prove that he is sane and that people don't just disappear. Stiller's preoccupation with trying to make sense of events is almost comical in the way that someone beating a dead horse is comical. Like a true noir protagonist, Stiller implodes in a fit of existential angst. But his existential crisis is literal; he questions his very existence. Fassbinder gives Stiller a wardrobe worthy of Humphrey Bogart, right down to the fedora. Stiller's inscrutable face, his attraction to the languid, enigmatic Eva (Mascha Rabben), draw attention to themselves as archetypes of film noir.

I enjoyed ""World on a Wire"", but it suffers from excessive length. Vollmer's secret and the answer to Stiller's questions will be obvious to most viewers after the first few scenes, if not actually in the first scene. This makes it feel like Stiller spends an hour and 40 minutes playing catch-up to the audience. It makes the audience impatient, if not bored. I don't know if the characters' predicament seemed as obvious to audiences in 1973 as it does now, but it may have, because there is nothing subtle in the way that Fassbinder represents his ideas. He beats the viewer over the head with any and every tidbit that he feels is significant. Dangling the movie's punchline in front of the audience so soon might not be a good idea, and there is a lot of superfluous footage. ""World on a Wire"" might have been better had it been an hour shorter. I would at least shorten the first part, if it were up to me. In German with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2012): The Criterion DVD presents the two parts of the film on separate discs, unlike the Blu-Ray. Bonus features on Disc 1 are: ""Interview with Gerd Gemnden"" (34 min), a worthwhile lecture by the Fassbinder scholar, recorded in 2011, in which he discusses the film's themes and visual style, eclectic cast, and compares it the novel. And there is a trailer (1  min) for the 2010 theatrical release. On Disc 2: ""Fassbinder's World on a Wire: Looking Ahead to Today"" (47 min), which is a ""making-of"" documentary made by Juliane Lorenz, Fassbinder's domestic partner and editor in his last years. It primarily interviews Michael Ballhaus, Fassbinder's frequent collaborator and this film's cinematographer, Franz Mller-Scherz, who co-wrote the script, and actor Karl Heinz Vosgerau, who played Siskins. They share their recollections of working with Fassbinder and the cast. Some additional interview subjects feature less prominently.",1349481600,2,5827,5.1543340380549685

The description says ""boundlessly inventive"" and ""a surreal look at the weird world of tomorrow"" ......... yes, it's set in the future, but nothing in the sets or costumes gives you any hint of ""future"".  The primary car is a Corvette .... sheesh.  The only element that seem added to the locations is the over-use of mirrors on almost ALL wall surfaces.

The plot may have been innovative at the time, but that ""twist"" has been done so many times now ... that it is obvious from early on - just what the ""surprise ending"" will be.

8494746,5,B0068CEGB8,"I came to this film backwards. It started with a movie called the Thirteenth Floor (1999.)Then from there read the book Simulacron-3 (1964) by Daniel F. Galouye. Then finally this film.

It was a little unnerving having to read English subtitles. Worse than that is this is a transliteration. The wording are juxtaposed and their inference is displayed and not a literal translation. It drove me crazy at first, as with the purposefully slow speech and very fundamental German you can pretty much keep up without the need of the subtitles with the exception of a word or two now and then as Ksekuchen (cheesecake.) they speak southern German which makes it much easier to follow.

Soon you get used to occasionally looking at the subtitles and can enjoy the movie as presented. It was made in 1973 but the people and cars and environment look 10 years older.

I was surprised to see the main character, Fred Stiller, played by Klaus Lwitsch of whom I recognized as Gustav Mackensen in The ODESSA File 1974 and Vlad (as Klaus Loewitsch) in Gotcha! 1985.

8494749,5,B0068CEGB8,"""World on a Wire"" is a 1973 two-part film made for German TV by director Rainer Werner Fassbinder concerning the meaning of reality. It is science fiction in that it deals with people and ideas set against a scientific or technological background - not with space monsters.
A government research institute is attempting to build a simulated world inside a computer and populate it with artificial people, with the idea that social and economic problems can be simulated via the community inside the computer. With the project nearing completion, the project director, Professor Vollmer, begins acting strangely during a meeting with a government minister, and dies mysteriously shortly thereafter. But, not before revealing to a friend that he has discovered a secret connected with the project -- something no one is suppose to know about! Vollmer's assistant, Fred Stiller, is promoted to Director and told to complete the project quickly.
Stiller soon learns about Vollmer's claim to have found something wrong, and suspects his death was not accidental. Stiller looks and acts more like a 70s detective than a computer scientist: hard drinking, heavy smoking, and tailor-made suits. In fact, he spends much more time on his investigation than he does actually working on the project.
In a subplot, the Institute's overall director, Siskins, a polished, well-manicured money man, is planning to sell the project's data to private industry rather than release it to the public.
There is a major revelation at the end of Part One, with enough twists and turns in Part Two to keep you guessing right up to the end. In fact, the film gets better and better with subsequent viewings as you can appreciate how skillfully the story is peppered with clues - even the acting style itself is a clue.
I recommend it highly with a few words of warning. The film has the usual polish one expects from a Criterion restoration, but was shot on 16mm film and may be too grainy for some tastes, and since it was made for 70s TV it is not wide screen. Also, it is in German with English subtitles, but no English soundtrack.",1425081600,5,2109,4.910364145658264

8494753,4,B0068CEGB8,"This movie is awesome. Some scenes feel as though you are watching the actors dance with the camera (particularly in the first part.) The soundtrack is weirdly amazing, consisting of famous licensed classical music with strange, loud 80s synths playing over it. As someone who likes Scifi and is currently quite interested in cinema, this was really worth it.

However, it could be shorter. Most of the movie consists of people not being able to understand that their world may be fake, which is a little bit unrealistic considering the last 200 (at least) years of philosophy. However, the point is made (that many people rely on their emotions for truth and falsities), and Fassbinder rewards us with some awesome scenes. Fassbinder also has the class to not spell everything out at the end.

Personally, I think the first part is better than the second, as it is certainly more stylized, but I would recommend this to any fan of 2001, Solaris, as well as fans of the Science Fiction big 3 plus Philip K. Dick.

Some people have complained about white subtitles on white backgrounds. I never had any trouble with this (watched it on Hulu.)",1385856000,2,1141,4.781725888324873
