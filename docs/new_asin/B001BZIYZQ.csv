8285361,5,B001BZIYZQ,Love Bickfords work.  This man has got it all figured out.  This is a documentary styled movie about the works of Bruce Bickford and his personal life.  This film bristles with magic and gave me an insight as to who the amazing bickford is.  Great film if your into stop motion/clay/animation.  Bickford is a genius hands down.,1250985600,5,327,4.666666666666667
