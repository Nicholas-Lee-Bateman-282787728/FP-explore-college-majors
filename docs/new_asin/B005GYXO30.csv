4698789,5,B005GYXO30,Wing Commander Academy: Complete Series this it not copy form TV and very happy with the DVD and the quality great,1367193600,,114,4.476190476190476
4698790,4,B005GYXO30,"Wing Commander, Xenosaga, Paragon Lost and Halo Legends are all based on computer games.  Wing Commander is not a copy of the other three.  Its unique in its execution.  It is also animated American science fiction, not Japanese Anime science fiction.

Its plot is familiar: aliens are pestering the humans.  The aliens are always pestering the humans.  This time the aliens look like bipedal lions.  Having the aliens look like something familiar to us worked very well because that made it possible for the aliens to have distinct personalities.

Each episode of Wing Commander is a self-contained  ministory.  The plot of each ministory is different enough so that I never felt that I was watching the same story over and over again.  That was very good.  The downside is that Wing Commander doesnt have a firm conclusion.  If you don't like a story that doesnt have a firm conclusion, thats going to be a problem for you.

The characters aren't deep.  That is normal for this type of story.  There is a low grade conflict between practical Commodore Tolwyn and more idealistic Cadet Maverick.  Some of the aliens were more interesting characters than the humans were.  There were two female human pilots, but they were more passive characters than the male pilots.  Near the end of Wing Commander, a female alien appeared.  She was a person of authority and gave the orders and the other aliens obeyed.  I thought that it was unusual for the story to have a strong female alien character, but not a strong female human character.

None of the scenes are enhanced by using CGI.  That makes the animation look somewhat dated, but the animation is still very satisfactory.  You won't be overawed by the animation, but you won't be disappointed by it.

Of the four DVDs that I listed at the beginning of my review, I would rate Wing Commander second.  I would rate Xenosaga first because of Shion and Kirsch.  Those two characters made the story.  I would put Halo Legends last because it was a mishmash, leaving Paragon Lost in third place by default.

I purchased my copy of Wing Commander from Amazon.  Amazons description of the DVD states that it has subtitles, but my copy didnt.  Although the audio is unusually clear, if you have a hearing impairment, you might not be able to follow the dialogue.  Using the Product Update button, I tried twice to get Amazon to change their description to ""no subtitles"", but it was never changed.",1364083200,22,2440,4.7631578947368425
4698791,4,B005GYXO30,Thanks for having it available.  I am looking for live action of the same title. But still it was enjoyable to watch the series.,1363305600,,128,4.333333333333333

4698794,3,B005GYXO30,"As animation goes this wasn't too bad. I was a huge fan of the old computer video game of this, in which Mark Hamil, John Rhys Davies, and Malcom McDowel actually stared. It was one of the early games that actually used real actors for the characters and didn't have them CGI. In this animation they did use Mark & Malcom for the voice overs. I had never seen this series on TV but looks to be at least 2 to 3 seasons long. For those of you who are fans of this game, you might also want to take a look at ""WING COMMANDER"" with Freddie Prinze Jr. It was also very well done and true to the game.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wing-Commander/dp/6305475822/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wing Commander</a>",1349568000,3,739,4.967741935483871
4698795,5,B005GYXO30,"It's about time this cartoon series came out on DVD! I truly loved watching this show when it ran on TV opposite the Mortal Kombat cartoon(which sorely needs to be released as well, by the way)! For ALL of you out there who, like me, loved playing the Wing Commander video games, this show is for you if you haven't seen it(and a blast to own for those of us who have missed it). What I liked best about it was that it rang true to the spirit of the stories of the characters(both good and evil). You get it all here! And, it's thankfully totally unlike the Wing Commander movie that Chris Roberts cobbled together, but don't get me wrong. I admire him for trying to release Wing Commander as a movie, but he made too many concessions of change just to make it live action. It was, at best, a mere shadow of the heart of the Wing Commander story we gamers all knew and loved. That is not the case with this series. Even though it only ran for a brief time, you get everything you knew from the games and more. I'm glad to see it out at last. This show makes up for the movie in every way! I invite sci-fi fans and gamers alike to check it out and see if you agree!",1333065600,27,1164,4.0873362445414845

4698797,3,B005GYXO30,"Interesting show featuring voices of some of the actors from Wing Commander 3 & 4.

Disc 1 has a bad audio mix that makes the music and fx far louder than the dialogue. Well-written sci-fi with kinda basic plotting. Disc 2 sounds fine",1478908800,,234,4.441860465116279

4698809,4,B005GYXO30,"An American Anime-ish looking animated TV series yes TV series not to be confuse with the movie (seriously I read two reviews that thought this was the movie)
The voice acting was great when you can actually hear it. Often times the background music is louder making you wonder who thought that was a good idea.
The story is decent, the main character is okay while the secondary characters seemed more interesting. I liked Maniac who isn't a really a arrogant jerk and Archer.  Interesting enough, Archer actually was the only one that had a continuing story arc and some character development. She was the only character to have a mini drama dealing with personal loss and felt conflicted.
Wishful thinking here but maybe if Wing Commander had a second season and better audio maybe it would have been better but still is not bad",1451260800,,831,4.731034482758621

4698826,2,B005GYXO30,"I'm a big Wing Commander fan! I loved all the computer games and bought them religiously as they came out. I was happy to find out about this cartoon series being released on DVD.

These are great action-packed episodes with interesting story lines but there is one thing that ruined it for me. The episodes have been badly audio mixed. In some of the episodes, the background music (typically in the battle scenes) overpowers the dialogue that is being said practically drowning out the person who is talking. However the audio levels return to a normal level when the people aren't engaged in battle sequences. However it is this annoying glitch that drives me nuts every time I try to watch one of the episodes.

I would recommend buying this only if you're a true Die-Hard Wing Commander fan who doesn't mind encountering some minor audio issues.",1415750400,9,850,4.775510204081633

4698829,3,B005GYXO30,"I am probably a little jaded on this.  This series ran for one season and is really made for kids.  I remember playing and loving the game so when I saw this I was very hopeful.  This series is supposed to be set before the game.  At the game you are a fully qualified pilot on your first assignment.  In this series you are an academy student who knows how to fly but just don't have the experience to be a full pilot.  A lot of the characters from the game are here.  Which I find just frustrating.

On the other hand, the characters that are here from the game are the same people.  It seems Universal hired the same actors to voice the characters.  Kind of a cool decision.

Back to the bad.  As I mentioned this is really made for kids so the messages and themes of the stories are very apparent.

Back to the good. They do have a good message and if I had kids I would want them to watch this series.

It just doesn't do much for an old guy.

Production values are good.  There are 13 episodes on two disc's.  No skips and the animation is quite good.

There are no special features.

If you are nostalgic about the game its not a bad purchase.  Not really what you would hope for but not bad.  If you have kids this becomes a much better buy.",1401580800,4,1249,4.078512396694215

8472477,5,B005GYXO30,"Reading other reviews I'm a little confused. Are we supposed to review how we received the product or the quality and entertainment value of the show itself? Well, I'll star how I received the products like you do normally for other products.

It came undamaged and in perfect condition in a timely manner. All 13 episodes are on the disc. 5 stars for product condition.

Now on to what people are down rating for:
First off, yes, the audio is wonky in some episodes where the music is louder than the dialog and is annoying. However, it is NOT the product that is damaged but in fact is how the episode was badly mixed back when it was originally made. I recall it being exactly like that when I watched it on TV as a kid. Keeping in mind that it is not so uncommon for kids cartoons of that time to have a few badly sound mixed episodes. The 80s and 90s were dangerous times, guys. lol Only a episode or two are like though so it's not like the whole series is funky.

This series was made in 1996 and supposedly a kids series. Keeping that in mind it plays out similarly as other ""serious"" cartoons of its time. I personally bought it for nostalgic reasons as it was a favorite series of mine as a kid and started watching it because one of my favorite all time Super Nintendo game was Wing Commander. As a ""serious"" cartoon it touches on some philosophical things relating to war though very dumbed down and mashed up to fit into a limited time frame which is to be expected of a kids cartoon. While the Kilrathi (alien cat people the humans are at war with) are most often depicted as the ""bad guys"" the series touches on the fact that war is more complicated than that. Which I find that sadly, while I recognized that as a child back in the 90s, grown adults watching the series today still can't seem to grasp the concept and what the cartoon was trying to say. Yes, this series is sloppy and lacking in many ways yet in others it touches where other cartoons dared not go which made it more interesting for kids who like picking out meaning and reason behind the stories.

With all that said this series would be enjoyable to those buying for nostalgic reasons and those who can appreciate old cartoons that try taking a bit more serious spin on things. This would not be enjoyable to people who compare old cartoons and movies to todays standards, which people who down rate it because of the show and not how the product arrived to them tend to be those types.",1527897600,,2471,4.353579175704989
