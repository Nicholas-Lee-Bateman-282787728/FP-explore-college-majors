8756524,5,B01DOOPT72,"One of the most remarkable opera productions I've ever seen. The two principals, Petibon and Jaroussky both give memorable perfomances (even though Jaroussky gets off to slightly rough start, he recovers nicely). In this stellar context, it's hard for those in the supporting roles to even be noticed, but Prohaska deserves at least an honorable mention. Of the rest, I didn't particularly care for the for Bradic's contralto and Baczyk's bass: -- their voices lack presence in the lower portions of their respective ranges  and the score required spending a lot of time there -- but all of the supporting roles are executed quite satisfactorily.  The orchestra's performance of what I think some of Handel's most attractive music is also first rate. The production, one of a number of recent opera productions with a well-assimilated cinematic precedent (in this case, ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"") is wonderfully well imagined and executed. It's rare for baroque opera to be produced with this degree of vividness and depth: it brings Ariosto's story to astonishing, poignant life.

(& yes, it's not for children, of any age)",1519084800,2,1125,5.136612021857924
8756525,1,B01DOOPT72,"Absolutely horrible production.  Why do European houses insist on producing these ultra modern, ugly, distasteful, sets and scenes of such classical operas?  I could not watch after several minutes.  Lots of fast forwarding before I stopped and threw the DVD away.  Not worth a penny.  I thought opera was an escape from reality, at least from current reality.  Seeing vulgar acts and military uniforms and guns in an opera production is like watching the news or a reality TV show.  Not for me.",1517097600,,495,4.891566265060241
8756526,4,B01DOOPT72,Exceptional.  The two sopranos are great singers and actors.  Jaroussky has a great voice but is a wooden actor.,1509926400,,112,4.842105263157895
8756527,5,B01DOOPT72,"Wow, this is a really psychological production.  It's quite clever in showing the difference between the reality and the illusion of the witch Alcina, but it also makes her a very real, if misguided, person.  And the singers absolutely cannot be beat!",1490745600,3,251,4.9523809523809526
8756528,3,B01DOOPT72,"Great singing by singers and ensemble but cluttered, nervously un-settled, silly direction and costumes which did nothing to enhance Handel's music.  Too many vaulgar and unnessesary directions which were irrelevant to original librettos and score and were very disturbing and detracting.  It was a failed experiment  to use a renowned but contraversial director just for the ""name value"".  This was a Horrible production which otherwise is one of the most interesting and beautiful Baroque operas.  Tragedy for singers to have to exhort their talent and energy under such poor direction.  I would have much prefered to listen to a CD and to not watch this DVD.",1488412800,2,661,5.188679245283019
8756529,3,B01DOOPT72,"It is not a review because I gave up after less than fifteen  minutes. As another reviewer mentioned, it is about sex.  The first scene is in a bedroom, with bedroom activities: when the first couple and their staff are gone, others use the bed (the maids did change the sheets).  I skipped through, watching here and there, and always there was that big bed in the middle of the stage.  I gave up.  This blue-ray will go to the library, with a sticker on it saying that it is not for children.  (Call me prudish if you want, but I already have William Christie's 3-CD set with Ren&eacute;e Fleming, Susan Graham and Natalie Dessay.  I do not have to watch that crappy staging. )",1488240000,4,679,4.384
8756530,5,B01DOOPT72,"Alcina is my favorite opera.  I have 3 CD versions and this is my 3rd video version.

This staging of Alcina is the most literal and cinematic of the 3 versions I have.  Alcina is a sorceress who lures men to her island where she puts a spell on them so they fall in love with her.  When she tires of them, she turns them into animals.  In the other videos, you never really see her turn anyone into animals but in this version, she has a machine that does it.  It is kind of like The Island of Doctor Moreau.

The singing and playing is all first rate.  Patricia Pettibon is one of my favorite singers and Philippe Jaroussky is one of the best countertenors around.  I hadn't heard of Anna Prohaska and Katarina Bradic before but they are both wonderful and sexy.

Which brings me to another point.

This is not an opera for children or anyone who might be considered prudish.  Alcina is luring men to her island primarily for sex and there is simulated sex in this presentation.  There is no nudity like the video of Alcina with Catherine Naglestad and Alice Coote but it is still likely to offend some people.

My only complaint is the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself.  The video quality is not as good as the rest of the Blu-ray operas in my collection.  It looks like they lowered the frame rate in order to cram over 3 hours of opera onto 1 disc.  This makes the image slightly jerky.  However, the audio quality is excellent and that is what counts the most.

I highly recommend this video.",1486166400,10,1500,4.330935251798561
8756531,5,B01DOOPT72,"Amazing singers, gorgeous orchestra, interesting production. I was lucky to attend the performance twice and I knew that the DVD will be wonderful.",1482796800,,147,5.434782608695652
8756532,1,B01DOOPT72,"I have a sizable opera blu-ray collection, and this is the first such disk with no auto-resume. Although not very common among all genres, the feature is practically a standard for classical music blu-rays, so imagine my surprise, when after stopping the player and turning it back on, the disk started from the beginning. Once more to set up options and push buttons to get to the point of interruption. I do not care how good the performance is (and this one is just okay); by not putting the auto-resume, the studio has ruined it for me. Unless they fix the problem and send me a replacement together with a nice gift, I am not buying from Warner again.",1481500800,4,656,4.5210084033613445
8756533,5,B01DOOPT72,"This is a terrific production. Petibon and Jaroussky show magnificent singing and artistic performance. Other singers are also outstanding. The visual impression is amazing. I wish I was there in 2015 in Aix-en-Provence. My wife and I left earlier, although I did contemplate our visit to the Festival. Do not hesitate to buy this BD. Patricia Petibon is so good as Alcina! It is difficult to find anything better. I also strongly recommend Sandrine Piau, but her performance can be seen only on You Tube. I wonder why?! I listen both Petibon and Piau over and over. And thank you Handel...",1480636800,3,590,4.851485148514851
