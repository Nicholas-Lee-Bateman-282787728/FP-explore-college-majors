803244,4,6304145462,It's a Stephen King movie and he's one of my favorites.  I gave it 4 stars. Because it's an old movie BUT that being said it's expected and it's a decent movie to watch in my opinion if it's your genre.,1478304000,,202,3.926829268292683

803307,1,6304145462,"This movie had little to do with King, but clearly he sold out in allowing it to be made.  Whatever happened to the suspicions the police held regarding Jim as the killer of the students?  Big hole in the plot.  No one excepting wife and kid could verify the odd endings and Mueller,  how would Jim explain his body, or did he go up in a puff of smoke? Had possibilities but Hollywood ""rocket scientists"" took care of that, and King (never was a fan)  was his usual sellout.  His books are really Grade C.  He must have a good publicist who can shove anything down the public's throat.",1447804800,,585,4.3119266055045875

803374,4,6304145462,"One of the best Stephen king thrillers ever, based on one of stephen king's short stories
incredibly scary supernatural Ghost story i must admit
brilliantly Directed by Tom McLoughlin & brilliant written for TV by Mark rosenthal
Great acting performances aswell by Tim Matheson and Robert rusler who played Head Gang member Richard Lawson
infact all the Actors that played all 3 Gang members give frightening performances,
all 3 Gang members steal the scenes in the film for sure
the film was a made for TV production back in 1991 not a theatrical movie released in Cinemas, Big Difference there
regardless of that it's still very scary supernatural thriller

first released on DVD back in 1999 by Liongate but only in 1:33:1 full screen format
and ofcourse no extras, no trailer either, the film was broadcast to TV so no Trailer
the Lionsgate picture quality looks terrible lots of Grain in the picture, Disgusting dvd release actually
and then the film gets 2 new reissues first is by MGM, the 2nd is by U.K. DVD second sight
the first reissue by MGM back in 2007
and for the first time ever the film is in 2:35:1 widescreen format, can you believe it
the picture quality looks amazing in 2:35:1 ratio MGM made the effort to clean up the picture for sure
very nice bright colours, hardly no Grain or dirt in the picture, much much better quality than the old Lionsgate dvd
the sound is still a 2.0 stereo mix, MGM only fixed up the picture quality
No extras of course on the new MGM dvd,
it would've been Great to get an Audio commentary or new interview with Director Tom McLoughlin about making the film
but ofcourse MGM did not bother
now U.K. Distributor Second sight also released the film on DVD aswell
and the picture quality is very similar to the MGM dvd
Second sight's dvd release is also in 2:35:1 widescreen, but not much Grain at all, very very clear picture
plus second sight also made an effort with the sound quality
something MGM, LIONSGATE failed to fix
the sound quality is a new 5.1 surround sound mix but no extras as usual thou
Second sight dvd is region 2 so you'll need all all regions player
so either choose the MGM DVD or get the Second sight dvd from amazon uk, up to you
5 stars for this TV film,
4 stars for this new MGM DVD based on new beautiful Widescreen transfer & new sound quality mix",1438214400,,2324,4.507109004739337

The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!

I remember sitting there in the living room with my dad. He got so mad because I would keep asking him questions about the movie. This movie and the sequel are some of the best memories I have of being a kid. Me and dad time, The best kind of time. This movie is a good scary movie without the blood and gore, without the nudity, and without the foul language that's so prevalent in all the scary movies now.",1416873600,3,578,3.948717948717949

A good example of high school thugs from the late 50's early 60's. Watching this film will make you wish that they didn't get a second chance. Revenge is justified when it's for a good reason and this story portrays revenge in an opposite setting, the wrong type of revenge.

I would certainly recommend watching this film.",1400889600,,450,4.54320987654321

803559,5,6304145462,"This story is perhaps one of King's best. It takes a typical family and puts them  "" between a rock and a hard place"".

This is one of King's , perhaps the best, creepy mindblowers. It takes a typical family and puts them ""between a rock and a hard place"" by fusing the past with the present. These thugs from the 50's , supposedly killed in a car/train crash are back in Tim's hometown where he has recently moved to confront his nightmares of guilt revolving around his brothers death. These thugs are out for vengeance on Tim. Are they real? Are they only alive in Tim Matheson's tortured mind? This story becomes all too real to the familly's dismay. What can be done to stop these insane creeps? Tim figures it out, but will it work? You will have to  buy this video to see the  outcome. If you grew up in the 50's, like King and myself this one really hits home. But you didn't have to grow up in the 50""s to sit on the edge of your seat with this  thriller!

803563,2,6304145462,this movie is garbage. grant that it's an oldy and horror conventions have changed over the decades. i give it 2 stars because i've actually walked through the train tunnel from where the movie draws its impetus. that was pretty cool... i believe this was one of the 1st short stories he sold. he must have been about 23. that's also pretty cool. the movie is garbage.,1365465600,2,368,4.507462686567164

It was never clear what was driving the boogeymen, or what the final confrontation was supposed to accomplish. At the end, the heretofor clueless central character started spouting off sure knowledge about the afterlife that was entirely unconvincing, so that what should have been an emotional moment didn't resonate at all.",1364428800,,413,5.369230769230769

803566,3,6304145462,"Watched this during my amazon prime trial. Good movie but i was hoping to find (using ""Video Finder"") more up to date stuff. Movies in amazon prime are either really old, or low rated with like 3 to 2 stars out of 5. The newer stuff they show you is low rated and the old movies, some are rated 4 to 5 stars, but... they're old. I don't want to sit around and watch old movies all year. Everything available to watch free is just BLAHHHH. blah blah blah stuff.

I looked extensively through the amazon prime selection for hours. Took me forever just to pick something to watch. Couldn't find much newer stuff. To much old or low rated stuff. Boring.

""Prime"" . . . ha. That's funny. More like ""old"". Really really old!
And... A LOT of movies that you can watch freely under netflix membership is available here as 2,3,4 and 5 dollar rentals, so... that's WAAAYYY more money out of pocket over time! And... some of the best of the best and most popular movies... here they are only available to buy, where-as under netflix membership, popular dvds can be sent to you in the mail and returned.

803615,3,6304145462,"This movie is another Stephen King story set to a low budget. However, it has a rather high fun factor due to the fact that it contains undead rock-a-rollers, and also one of the coolest cars seen in a movie. Take these away and there's not much left, but because of these elements, the movie takes on a weird life of it's own and therefore succeeds.

I saw this for the second time on Prime, and I had many laughs as I imagined the main character to be a psychotic guy who kept tripping out, and believed he (and his family) was being persecuted by the undead!

Unfortunately, this movie has some major flaws that are quite obvious and gives the viewer an overall impression of cheese.

For example, the wife character is grinning when she is confronted by the undead, like she's trying not to laugh and failing.

The undead look rather silly when they switch into ""zombie mode"" and the ""flying chunks"" are hilarious. The special effects are mediocre, and the plot itself is thin. I will not describe the ending, but suffice to say it is a cheese fest of epic proportions.",1360454400,5,1073,4.487179487179487

They are terrorizing him and his family and he has to face his old fears all over again.  He is forced into a confrontation with evil that has haunted him for 21 years....

This is a good adaptation of the Stephen King short story of the same title.  It is a good movie and the end is dramatic.  It is not as bloody or gory and many of Stephen King's stories are but there are some scenes in the movie that are scary.

I was practically transported back in time to my parents living room floor, totally creeped out and unable to go to the bathroom for fear someone will get me lol.

One thing I gotta say though... I'm a fan of widescreen releases and the widescreen on this movie is beautiful! Quality is a 10! I am so happy I bought this DVD, but I still have my old VHS tape with the full screen version. I have to say that this is one of those very RARE times when I kinda like watching a movie in full screen with crappier quality. haha It's weird but it makes the movie so much more creepy.

His brother was killed by a group of switch blade, leather jacked wearing punks. The group was killed in a tunnel by a train. Now, Jim comes back to the small town to become a teacher.

803731,5,6304145462,"'Sometimes they Come Back' was a 1991 film based on a short story by Stephen King. It was filmed for TV and is a personal favourite. It is about a school teacher (Tim Matheson) who returns to his hometown to teach at a school. He has reservations about doing this because of a tragedy which occurred many years before. The movie has a real feel of eeriness about it, and while far fetched at times, is credible because of the way a person's mind can be affected by unresolved past issues. Definitely worth a viewing.

DVD BACKGROUND: This was first released on DVD in 2001 by a smaller DVD company. As a result the transfer was far from superior and looked like a straight video to DVD transfer. It was 1:33 full frame too.  Initially I thought 1:33 was the correct framing since it had been filmed for TV back in 1991.  In late 2007, MGM released the film on DVD. While Amazon list the technical details as 1:33, it is actually 2:35 widescreen anamorphic. Seeing the film like this has brought a whole new dimension to a great film. According to a website I looked at the other day, this film was indeed filmed in widescreen. Even more exciting is the new DVD image is a vast improvment on the earlier DVD.  Beautifully cleaned up and all.

OVERALL THOUGHTS:  A great adaptation of a short Stephen King story which has been re-released on DVD respectfully. A stellar image presented in its correct aspect ratio.  If you have only ever seen this film in the cropped video version or cropped early DVD version, do yourself a favour and purchase the new MGM release and experience the film in glorious widescreen.",1191888000,25,1611,4.5344827586206895
803732,3,6304145462,"...favorites when I was younger, and I remember seeing it first time with a friend of mine in his house late at night -and I found it both scary and facinating. I remember the car playing an effective supporting role to ""the boys from hell"", and I remember the look on those boys faces as frightning -and their behaviour as a good match to this bad-boy-style.

This movie being all in all a typicall work from the supposely horrormaster, Stephen King himself. Before I go on with ""Sometimes They Come Back"" I have to add that to my disappointment Stephen King is no longer on top of this genre. One; Probably because I'm older now -but also Two; Many of his book-adaptions (including his own, and not only for their time of production) are so amateurish and of the made-for-television-kind that I don't find him as ""convinsing"" anymore. The book behind ""Pet Semetary"", well, it still gives me the creeps -a masterpiece in the horror-genre, done with style and intellect, and the name ""Zelda"" sure brings back some unpleasant memories from that book (It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I remember it as rather creepy too). My point is; I remembered ""Sometimes They Come Back"" as one of the better adaptions, but times really have changed -to my big disappointment... This movie is average, nothing special to it at all. I had in mind, of course, that it could turn out be a little different than how I remembered it, but the B-movie-feel and the bad picture-quality and sound, and cheap effects not to mention, and the amateurish filming -yes, at first I thought I was looking at a movie from the middle of the 80's, and man was I surprised to read that this movie was produced for tv already back in 91. The quality sure makes it seem older than that, and as you can imagine it didn't exactly help it either.

On the plus side; The acting is good, the lead character (The teacher) and the bad boys are fit for their parts, and saves the movie this way from being a total disaster. Their laughter (the bad boys') indeed still sounds as wicked as I recalled it (another plus I guess) reminding me of hyenas. The car looks ""bad"" (as another plus), the story makes the movie entertaining enough to keep the viewer from turning the dvd off or shifting channel.

A better production (and adaption) of this King-story could have been a hit, I'm sure of that. I'd give ""Sometimes They Come Back"" 3 out of 6 stars actually, because of interesting story and good acting and good choise of cast for the movie. Other than that I find it outdated since long, and if you have no ""relationship"" to the movie I'd recommend you to do something else, maybe read the book instead -I know I will.",1116806400,4,2686,4.51129363449692
803733,4,6304145462,"Poor Jim Norman (Tim ""Animal House"" Matheson), he's just moved back to his hometown after a disastrous end to his teaching career in Chicago. In his new school, the principal hates him and his students are mostly hateful jocks. To make matters worse, Jim's memories of growing up in this town are dominated by the day his brother was killed 27 years earlier by four greasers in a black car. Jim wakes up nightly, deeply disturbed by realistic nightmares of the event. Soon, three of the kids in his class are murdered and replaced by the ghosts of three of the killers from Jim's past! You see, Jim's brother wasn't the only one who died that day. The punks who killed him were hit by a train! Now, Jim must face his past and deal with his fear in order to save himself and his family from certain death. Matheson is very good as Jim. His wife is played by Brooke Adams (Shock Waves, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers). The ghostly-greasers are certainly worthy of special mention, as they are truly menacing and funny in an evil sort of way. They seem like the kind of guys you might run into in some lonely alley. Guys who laugh and joke around while robbing and killing you! Just imagine these crazy types as seemingly indestructible undead who are after you and your loved ones!

803734,5,6304145462,"Wow!!!  What a great movie.  This is my favorite movie of all time.  Sometimes they come back is so well thought out. The story is heartbreaking and startling on some scenes.  Although, you can't help but to laugh at those killers at times. The laughs!!!!  You'll never forget the hoods's laughs.
  Jim Norman goes back to his hometown years after he and his family fled when he was just a kid.  The horrible death of his older brother drove he and his parents to live elsewhere. Although, since this was the only teaching job open, Jim has returned once again.  The horrible day when his brother was harassed by 4 gangsters that soon led to three of the hoods's deaths is played over and over again in Jim's mind, for Jim's brother lost his life too.  Jim is constantly haunted in his dreams but soon he is haunted literally.  The 3 departed gangsters return one by one to finish ""unsettled business"".
  This is a must see film.  Every actor was so good at their part. It seems like you're there and all through the movie, you're on edge for Jim and his family as he deals with the figures on his past.",1070496000,4,1103,4.396039603960396

I love the way 3 cool greasers from the '60s come back in the '90s and are exactly the same as when they died in '63. How cool those greasers were and the way all the other kids marveled at their charisma in the classroom was cool! It was also cool how that kid Jimmy became a man and then stood up to them. Those greasers and their hotrod were so cool. This movie is an A plus! Rock on Stphen King!",1016582400,6,546,4.160377358490566

803774,5,6304145462,"This film is a piece of art, a masterpiece too. It brings together, in a very frightening and disquieting way, many of Stephen King's themes. First two brothers, in the past, one being killed by four bullies. Second, the dead brother is coming back from beyond to help his little, now older, brother solve the problem. Third, the problem is the return of three of the bullies who were killed by a train in their car under a tunnel because the surviving brother had stolen away the key of the car they had dropped, blocking them thus in front of the train. Four, the three bullies are systematically killing the students of the surviving brother, now a teacher who came back to his native city, five, one after another because they have any normal contact with him. Five, they make the deaths look strange so that the teacher will be suspected. Six, he knows about them, either because he sees the crimes in real life, but he is the only one to see them, or because he is haunted in his dreams with a vision that tells him every detail. Seven, this will go on till he accepts a final confrontation in the very same place where the first confrontation occurred in the past. Eight, they will be destroyed by a replay of the train scene, etc. This film is very disquieting because it means no one must ever come back to a place they have fled because of a dramatic event. Or if one ever comes back to such a place, one will have to confront the past and solve it by solving the problem that happened in this past. This theme is common in Stephen King's novels, like, for example,  Dolores Claiborne  or  IT . The theme of the living deads has been used over and over again, and the great value of Stephen King's imagination is that he introduces so many variations that we, at times, do not even recognize the theme, like in  The Dark Half , for instance.

803775,4,6304145462,"This is a great movie that is based on a rather strange short story by the master himself, Stephen King. The original short story was very short and  had a ""strange"" ending. This movie, i my opinion is better than  the story by far. The original short story I think is only 20 or 30  something pages and lacks alot of characterization. This movie fills in the  giant hole that is in the short story. And believe it or not, this  made-for-tv movie has great acting. The boys who play the hoods are pretty  convincing--especially Richard Lawson.  The story is about a teacher  named Jim Norman who moves to a new town in whicch his brother was killed  by a group of hoods in about thirty years earlier. He keeps having dreams  about them that are haunting him. One day on of his students ends up  missing and one of the dead hoods from the 50's is seating in his seat--for  every person they kill another one comes back. Student after student keeps  being killed and another after another hood returns to class for revenge.  Th only way that they can be stopped is if they have a final confrontation  with Jim back in the tunnel that claimed the lives of his brother and the  hoods. The results are awesome.  On another note the DVD isn't very good.  The transfer doesnt seem to do the justice. The picture messes up every  once and a while and sometimes i noticed that the words seem to not match  their mouth!  The sound is awesome though.

803776,2,6304145462,"This made-for-TV movie (given a fake ""R"" rating in a shameless attempt to boost sales) is one of many TV adaptations of Stephen King's  work. Fans of the Master of Horror will be disappointed, but novices  looking for a tame and relatively bloodless horror film will enjoy it. A  schoolteacher (Tim Matheson) finds himself and his students stalked by the  vengeful spirits of some nasty punks who murdered his brother and then got  themselves run over by a train. The strengths of this movie are in King's  storyline and the solid acting; the weaknesses are in the incredibly  watered-down script and the bargain basement production values. This could  have been a great miniseries, but the network obviously didn't want to  spend the money, and slapped together this movie instead. A really  low-budget effort that shows where the corners were cut. As for the DVD  itself, the picture quality is as good as it can get for a telefilm, and  the sound is rich and full.
