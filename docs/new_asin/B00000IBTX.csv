7910437,3,B00000IBTX,"I really am surprised to see so many four/five stars reviews.  The movie isn't really that good. Normally, if I like a movie, but know it is not really a good movie (normally what one labels a guilty pleasure), I give it three stars.  That way, I have indicated I liked it but know that the film suffers and is objectively not very good.  That is this film.

Even for its date (1977) the direction is poor and the script is poor.  For example, with regard to the directing, we get, as one viewer noted, an overly long, I mean really long, and poor camera work with regard to the title character, Oyama (Chiba) fighting a bull.  This incident is loosely based on the real Oyama who fought bulls to display his karate supremacy. Also there is the rape scene, which demonstrates a poor script.  As far as I have ever read, Mas Oyama didn't rape anyone, little a lone, if he had, it is doubtful the woman would then fall in love with him after such a horrible act.

Chiba's karate personality fits well with the Street Fighter series, but it is awkward here. The movie is trying to be a reflection of Oyama's life and therefore, one would hope not only would the script be more faithful, but so would the fighting style.  Chiba was a student of Oyama's, but his fighting movements are not reflected of Kyokushin.  Of, course, the script is faithful in only small vignettes (like Oyama helping the widow and her son after he killed her husband in a bar fight), but fails on so many other levels.

With all the negatives, why three stars, `cause at certain parts, the movie is fun.  The opening tournament scenes are a blast to watch.  Chiba does a great job in showing remorse for his sins and the sins of his top student. Lastly, the final fight scenes are also terrific and I love that mid 70s soundtrack - it is simple and the score fits the movie well.  So, all in all, a guilty pleasure and I only recommend people who love 70s Japanese karate flicks.",1206230400,,1951,4.383333333333334
7910438,5,B00000IBTX,"Champion of Death is one of the best action films you will ever see. It's true. Period. Story is based not only on life of Oyama Masutatsu,few episodes taken from tales about Miyamoto Musashi.
Cinematography is good. Stylish and expressive. Fights not to modern taste,but great! You can't go wrong with this movie. Watch it. It's has real kyokushinkai masters after all,do you need something more??!!",1053820800,,400,5.075757575757576
7910439,4,B00000IBTX,"Sonny Chiba is both an accomplished actor and martial artist. He holds dan rank in both Kyokushin karate and Nippon Shorinji Kempo.
Back in the 70's Chiba made two biographical films about the life of the founder's of each of those arts. The film about So Doshin, founder of Shorinji Kempo, was released in the U.S. with the idiotic title ""The Killing Machine."" A terrible misnomer about the life of a truly great man who was anything but a killer or a machine.
Chiba's film about Sosai Mas Oyama, founder of Kyokushin karate, is equally mistitled here as ""Champion of Death."" I believe I read somewhere that the film was also released in English under a different, and equally silly, title called ""The God Hand.""
Of the two films, the one about Master So Doshin is the better of the lot, but fans of Karate generally and of Oyama karate in particular will not want to be without ""Champion of Death.""
There is actual footage at the beginning of the film of a Japanese Kyokushin training class on a beach, and there is even a 10-15 second close up of Sosai himself executing Seiken tsuki!
Chiba does a reasonably good job with portraying Oyama's life, though I suspect some of this is embellished (the rape scene, I hope!) for cinematic purposes.
My one complaint is that although the DVD is dubbed into English, there are several places where Japanese signs or texts are shown that are crucial to scenes in the film but they are left untranslated and unspoken in English.",1049673600,3,1471,4.639846743295019
7910440,1,B00000IBTX,"Not a very good movie.  I've seen a lot of martial arts movies, so I'm used to the crazy story lines, but this one was pretty bad.  The action was okay, but I got a headache watching the scene where Sonny fights the bull.  They tried to make it so you were right there in the action, but the result is just a long segment of very jerky shots, which got annoying after awhile.  The transfer was pretty poor, so the picture isn't really that good.  If you really want to see Sonny Chiba in action, doing what he does best, get the Streetfighter series.  With a title like Champions of Death, I expected to see more action.",1004400000,2,620,4.211864406779661
7910441,5,B00000IBTX,"""Champion of Death"" chronicles the life of a hero by the same name. Sonny Chiba brings an inspiring performance of a lifetime in a movie that keeps audiences coming back asking, ""What just happenned?"".  The depth of his character pulling beyond the cliche roles of karate  masters that Sonny is often cast. He now portrays teacher, serogate father,  farmer, and evil rapist. The film climaxes as Sonny, in a drunken stupor  kills a man only to find that his ""fists of fury"" carry  consequences and that some people you maliciously kill have families.  Families who become quite hungry when there is no father to bring home  food. The film answers the questions other martial arts films have  neglected. It also helped Sonny Chiba to finally be recognized by the  Hollywood Walk of Fame, that is the walk of fame in our hearts.",962841600,,826,4.76056338028169
7910442,4,B00000IBTX,"sonny chiba portraits a war-veteran, karate master, and rapist.  rapist?  yes, rapist.  that's our hero ladies and gentlemen.  but don't worry he says he's sorry.  to prove it he kills an angry bull with his bare hands in  what could be considered the greatest fight of all time.  so if you ever  become desperate enough to watch this movie, you'll love it as much as I  do.",962668800,,374,4.462686567164179
