593529,5,6303203264,"After working out my upper body at a beginning level for quite some time, I was finally ready to move on to something more challenging.  Although Cory's workout was highly recommended, I was a little nervous about working out with a former Ms. Olympia.  I need not have feared, however; the workout, while quite challenging due to the high number of repetitions, is also quite accessible to various exercise levels.  Even most advanced beginners would be able to make it through this routine using lighter weights and completing less sets of each exercise.  Furthermore, Cory is extremely non-threatening; rather, she's a smiling, laughing ""workout buddy"" (her words).
After a brief warm up (3 1/2 minutes), the routine is divided into three sections:  shoulders, biceps/forearms, triceps.  Each section starts with a strength building move, which means 3 sets of 12 repetitions using the heaviest weight you can manage.  For shoulders, it's the shoulder press, for biceps, the bicep curl, and for triceps, it's a lying tricep extension.  Next comes a ""tri set""--3 different exercises, each performed for 12 repetitions, and then the entire series repeated twice (3 times total).  I generally lose light weights (5 lbs.), but I often have to sit out a few repetitions in order to keep pace with Cory.  A brief stretching segment is a nice conclusion to this tough workout.
Cory uses various equipment, including dumbells, barbells, and an exercise bench, but I've been able to get by with dumbells alone and no bench (I use a chair or the floor instead).  Clocking in at exactly 30 minutes total, this is an excellent, challenging workout for the entire upper body.",1016496000,8,1665,5.04014598540146
593530,5,6303203264,"This video instruction is very good and the workout has my muscles burning. If you find this a little fast just put on
pause while you finish your set and go on to the next.",1001808000,6,173,3.9714285714285715
593531,5,6303203264,"This is a fast paced workout......all arms & shoulders...and, one of the very best I've ever done.  I saw results after the first week of doing this twice a week.  I highly recommend this video!",992390400,4,194,4.514285714285714
593532,5,6303203264,"I was afraid this would be too difficult for me but was pleased to discover it was fast paced and was an absolutely wonderful workout.
Age doesn't matter with this workout. If you're a woman of a ""certain  age"" or a man of middle age you'll get a lot out of this video. And it  won't hurt you.
Cory carefully instructs you in three sets of each lift  and twelve reps. You can use different size weights --- whatever is  suitable for you. And you can use dumb bells or a bar bell for all but two  exercise. For those two, I made up my own routine based on routines for the  triceps.
I found this video to be easy to follow and found Cory a  delight. You can go at your own pace and improvise where you must. But  believe me, the next day you'll know you had a workout. And you'll look  forward to the next.
I highly recommend this video. And I'm hard to  please when it comes to exercise videos. Most I do once and that's it. If  you want to gain muscle and/or strength or simply get fit, you need this  tape.",960940800,26,1008,4.060913705583756
593533,5,6303203264,"This is a must have video if you want your arms to look great. My muscles had been dormant until I tried this video,but now I'm starting to see improvement after only two weeks. This is not an easy video,I repeat,this is  not easy...but it gets the job done. If you're really serious about having  great looking shoulders,biceps,and triceps,then this video is for you.",939081600,6,368,4.734375
7840768,5,6303203264,Love it!!,1489708800,,9,4.0
7840769,5,6303203264,This is a must have from beginner to elite athlete and the reason why I say this is because weight used is relative and you can consistently increase the weight as needed the more you do this video. The possibilities are limitless with how you can do the order of the workout as well as. I am an Trainer. This workout is solid.,1476403200,,327,4.2063492063492065
7840770,5,6303203264,"LOVE this tape, buying again for the second time my VCR ate my first copy.  This is a very basic but tough, upper body workout, no frills and fancy stuff just good basic exercises.  You can customize it to fit your needs an excellent tape to have in your arsenal.",1462406400,,263,4.24
7840771,5,6303203264,"I got the product sooner then told which is always a nice surprise and it was in perfect, ""like new"" condition. The VHS tape works as it should and the sleeve was barely even worn (again ""like new""). I'm a Happy customer and would absolutely purchase from this seller again!",1391472000,,274,4.5
7840772,5,6303203264,"I love this video.  It is actually, my second.  I had lent my first to a friend and you know how that goes.  So I searched and luckily found it on Amazon.  Cory makes it so easy and I saw results in 2-weeks working out with her that I didn't get working out in a gym for a year!",1169164800,,278,3.6610169491525424
7840773,5,6303203264,"Even though this tape was made in the 90's, the routine that Cory uses is time-tested and effective.  I love working out with Cory.  She's very likeable, has a great personality, and I am seeing very impressive results since I've been doing this workout.  I do this routine at least twice weekly, and have added an additional set to increase the effectiveness for me.

Cory has a beautiful body and it is very obvious why she won Ms. Olympia six times!!!  She knows what works and I am a testimony to that.

I look forward to doing this workout!!!",1168473600,2,547,4.474747474747475
7840774,5,6303203264,"I met Cory Everson YEARS ago when she was competing and appearing at body building shows and competitions.  So, it was ironic 15+ years later to read out her videos that I knew nothing about (but wished I had before now).  I did purchase this based upon an Amazon list and have really enjoyed this workout!  I think Cory does a fantastic job in guiding the viewer through a quality arms and shoulders workout.  I am a long time workout fanatic, but after finishing this video even I marvel at how ""pumped up"" my arms and shoulders are.  Yes, it's corny with the thongs, big hair and dated earrings, but the workout is quality and stands the test of time.  If you can get your hands on this video, do, it is well worth your time and effort!",1141430400,2,739,4.318840579710145
7840775,4,6303203264,"I just received my 2nd copy of this video, my VCR ate the first one. It is a great video, parts of it are a little cheesy but it is well worth the money. There are 3 sets of 12 reps per exercise, you work shoulders first, starting with the muscle building exercise, overhead press, then you go on to front raises, rear delt raises, and lateral raises which Cory calls toning & shaping exercises. She repeats this pattern for all the muscle groups. Then it's on to biceps, the first being 3 sets of normal bicep curls with palms out, then 1 arm concentration curls, then hammer curls. You repeat the concentration curls 2 more times, but for the last exercise in the ""tri-set"" instead of hammer curls, you do normal bicep curls and bicep curls where you turn you arm in at the top. After biceps she work the forearms, forearm curls, wrist curls, and reverse wrist curls. I usually skip these and insert a few chest & back exercises which are not included in this workout. Lastly, it is triceps, you do lying tricep extensions first, then french press, kickbacks and the last exercise is lying close grip bench press which really works your triceps. There is also a brief warmup and cooldown.

This workout is about a half hour and very thorough for the muscle groups represented. It does move at a fast pace, and the reps are a little fast, which I end up pausing the tape often for a rest or to finish the set. But that is really the only negative in this video. I think that Cory is a pleasant instructor, she is encouraging, motivating and inspiring.  I plan to using this video twice a week in addition to my other workouts, I am anxious to see the results. This is the tape that I am sure I will get them.",1103846400,4,1709,4.35423197492163
7840776,5,6303203264,"Very easy to follow. Slow, precise movements. Go through all the weight lifting exercises and repitions with Cory Everson. I feel fantastic after the workout. It motivates me to make healthy meal choices throughout the rest of the day because I focus more on what my muscles need to perform and grow, rather than what my emotions want me to devour. I am seeing definition in my shoulders and arms. Highly recommended for the home gym.",1027036800,5,434,4.723684210526316
7840777,5,6303203264,"I have been an avid exerciser for about 18 years - it's routine for me.  During that time I have viewed a lot of exercise videos.  Cory's videos are absolutely the best.  This upper body workout is intense, but not to the point that you become dismayed and want to give up.  I have noticed more sculpting in my arms after just 2 weeks (and I have been doing weights for a long time!) There is a bit of fluff in her videos, but in my opinion, it just makes it more interesting and engaging.  The important thing is that the workout is serious and is obviously choreographed by someone who knows a great deal about fitness.  I highly recommend this video for a great upper body!",1024531200,7,676,4.283464566929134
