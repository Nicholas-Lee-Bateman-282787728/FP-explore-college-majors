7955388,1,B00005UNB2,"This DVD is interesting but not that helpful practically speaking. No real advice that you can actually apply. Mostly idealistic, conceptual talk. Also, I'm pretty sure that some of these other reviews are written by the people who made the movie.",1099180800,8,247,5.048780487804878
7955389,5,B00005UNB2,"The DVD wis broken down by aspects of the music industry in which one WILL deal with when starting out. Anything you need to address in any situation is fulfilled in this audio/video presentation. All people who have various knowledge from the actual artist to the CEO/President of small and large labels answers various topic questions. Every genre of music has one representative, I believe. If you want to know about what all goes on from various points of view and situations, this is one to own. A must own for anyone who just wants to know about the insides of the music industry.
Only bad note... is the annoying music in the background.",1048809600,5,644,4.657894736842105
7955390,5,B00005UNB2,"This is truly one of the most valuable purchases I have made in a while. I have been looking for some sound advice for getting into the industry, and my search has proved to be successful. I did not expect to hear celebrities discussing personal stories on their starts. It was good to hear that they struggled just as much, if not more than I have before breaking through. I highly reccommend this program for all who aspire to develop a career in music.",1031184000,3,455,4.428571428571429
7955391,5,B00005UNB2,"Hey all, I've been dreaming of a life on stage, and on the road, but I have had the worst luck with those insane record companies. I just can't manage to get my demo in the right hands. I gave Inside Sessions a try, and I wasn't too sure it would be worth it but I was wrong! These guys rock with their great advice that had never even crossed my mind. I would highly reccommend this program for anyone who loves music, and wants to learn how to get involved in the real biz! Good Luck and check this stuff out.",1031184000,2,511,4.019607843137255
7955392,5,B00005UNB2,"Songwriting is definitely my passion in life. I've always wanted to try to get published but I'm not exactly sure how to go about it. I did some research on various different resources and decided to buy this DVD. I'm very happy that I chose this because it gave me very extensive information regarding the business and songwriting. I got helpful tips from songwriters like Sheryl Crow and Bernie Taupin as well as advice from record execs like Tommy Mottola and Russell Simmons.. For all songwriters that are trying to get published like me, this is definitely the best place to start learning about the industry and how to be successful. It helped me greatly!",1028073600,4,661,4.756521739130434
7955393,5,B00005UNB2,"Well, when it comes to getting first hand knowledge as to how the music industry functions, you can't go wrong by watching this one. The amazing part about it is that it contains footage from both artists and executives. So, I really felt like I was able to see both sides of the music industry; the struggle to make it as an artist (such as myself), and struggle to become an executive. It was also just cool to hear people like Sting, Fred Durst, and Rob Zombie talk about their thoughts on the industry rather than their music. Anyways, if you have any aspirations of getting into the music industry this would be a great place to start. I use this dvd as my coach and inspiration",1025654400,,683,4.3858267716535435
7955394,5,B00005UNB2,"This purchase was a good investment for me. I was able to learn a lot about the music industry from the artists and execs that actually make and create it. They provided a lot of information on things that other companies probably couldn't offer. Things like the mentality you need and the type of person they look for. And just hearing what the big time artists have to say about how they made it just showed me why they were the ones picked to be stars as opposed to everyone else. I just wanted to say to anybody and everybody who had any doubts on this purchase, take it from me... I checked it out and it really is a great investment. You can't help but learn and gain insight of what the music industry is all about.",1025136000,,722,4.239130434782608
