8379637,3,B002SUP7MQ,"Unless one is particularly interested in aspects of the history of aviation, the main reason to get a copy of this film is to see the work of Busby Berkeley, pre Warner Brothers. You will not be disappointed.  The two sequences around the songs ""Happy Landings"" and Dance Until the Dawn"" are worth the price, by themselves.  The story is silly, but we expect that, and yes, the form of the musical is developing before our eyes, so anyone interested in the history of the genre will want this movie.  Performances are the usual Hollywood-professional, and the movie was well-made within the budgets applied to such a film.

The DVD copy has issues which one must accept.  For quite some minutes from the start, the image jumps at a rate of about once per second, in a way that suggests a fix should have been easy, but it is there.  Eventually this goes away.  Resolution is as good as with most material of this vintage.

The choice of Bert Lahr for a big role follows the trend of the era with a major role in a musical given to a fool, such as with Eddie Cantor, and seems unusual to folks in 2016, but one must think of how things were different in another era.  In just a few years we would find guys like Dick Powell having the major part, and the foolish role was eliminated or relegated to a minor position.

But the songs, and the Busby Berkeley sequences are marvellous.  They will stay in you mind, all though the day, and as you wake up at night.  Yes, Busby Berkeley did exist pre-Warners, and his work is worth seeing.",1466035200,,1532,4.3936170212765955

8379640,4,B002SUP7MQ,"Happy Landing was a lively musical upon which this movie is based on. The top of the cast include Charlotte Greenwood, Pat O'Brien and Bert Lahr. Lahr is a zany making his screen debut in his original Broadway role. He plays an amateur aviator who makes a world record flight because he didn't know how to land. Greenwood meets him by offering $500 in search of a husband, and Lahr gladly accepts the offer of $500. There is a great deal chemistry between Lahr and Greenwood that includes hijinks and screwball comedy. It also stars Hedda Hopper, Charles Winninger, and Guy Kibbee. The numbers for the musical was staged by Busby Berkeley. This is an absolute screwball slapstick!",1426118400,,680,4.771186440677966
8379641,3,B002SUP7MQ,"I for one was bothered by the rhythmically jerking frame during the first 15 minutes of the film, and occasionally thereafter.  I think that this could have been digitally corrected, but only if Warners had wanted to invest further in a restoration.

The Aerocopter invention that the story revolves around is strictly a creation of the props department, which would work for the stage, but you might wish that an actual autogyro of the day had been substituted for the film version.  On location action occurs at one of the LA area airports as the Aerocopter tries to win an altitude record.  Still, this sometimes racy comedy is entertaining, with Busby Berkeley numbers thrown in.",1373155200,,683,4.913043478260869

8379643,4,B002SUP7MQ,"FLYING HIGH (1931) - Bert Lahr, Charlotte Greenwood, Pat O'Brien, Charles Winninger, Hedda Hopper, Guy Kibbee

In this star turn, Lahr does his burlesque clown ""nyahn-nyahn-nyahn"" bit (it's not the Cowardly Lion folks, it's his slapstick cop from an old 1920s routine with his wife).

Busby Berkeley trots out overhead views of girls in kaleidoscopic formations and O'Brien is his dapper self in this adaptation of the George White (of the famous Scandals) stage production. Pre-code fun in a musical tale of aerocopter inventor Lahr, his forced marriage to Greenwood and their record-breaking 53,000 foot ascent.

Recomended for all fans of early Depression Era comedies.",1278115200,4,672,5.380952380952381
8379644,1,B002SUP7MQ,"Unless you want to watch the cowardly lion stitck from Wizard of Oz for over an hour, or are a big fan of seasickness don't bother.  Granted the shakiness of the picture did stop after about 10 minutes it didn't improve the movie.  The suddenly popped in choreography numbers and a script that didn't flow made me wonder why this one would be put out for a collector when there are so many better ones sitting in dust on shelves.  I have an extensive collection of old movies with many from the 30's but I have to say I am disappointed to have purchased this one.  The best thing about it was the write up on the back.  A lot of promise with no follow through.",1273363200,3,660,4.2063492063492065
8379645,4,B002SUP7MQ,"This is the rarest of beasts - a musical comedy film from 1931. Hardly any were made in either 1931 and 1932 due to the bad reputation the earliest musicals had earned in 1929 and 1930. However, almost all of the American musical films made in 1931 and 1932 featured the choreography of Busby Berkeley, and indeed this one does too.

Pat O'Brien is the best known of the three stars here, but he basically plays a supporting role in this one, prior to his recruitment by Warner Bros. first as a smart guy in the precode era and then as a father figure after the code. Sport Wardall (O'Brien) rescues Rusty Krouse (Lahr) from a group of bullies. The two team up with Wardall looking for financial backing for Rusty's aerocopter, a flying machine that ascends straight up. Ultimately Wardall finds backing from homely but man-hungry waitress Pansy Potts (the lanky Charlotte Greenwood). Her fee for the needed five hundred dollars - marriage to Rusty sight unseen.

If you've seen Greenwood chasing Buster Keaton in ""Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath"" or Eddie Cantor in ""Palmy Days"" you've seen this act before, but it's always funny. What must have seemed very odd to the audiences of 1931 was Lahr's brand of humor. Here he is carrying on just exactly like the cowardly lion in ""Wizard of Oz"" right down to his voice and mannerisms, so modern audiences will probably not be put off by Lahr since most people have already seen him in that role.

The audio sounds good here in this unrestored DVD-R Warner Archive product, but the video at the beginning is a little shakey literally. The frames have some slight up and down motion in the first ten minutes. However this may well be the master as the last time I saw this film on TCM I observed the same jerkiness in the video. It really is not bad enough to complain about, I just thought I'd let you know.

I rate this 4/5 for fans of the early talkies and precodes, but if you are a modern film fan you just might not appreciate this one that much.

Do be aware that you can buy this DVD-R directly from Warner Bros. for under twenty dollars or in a four-pack with along with three other films - ""Everybody Sing"", ""Rosalie"", and the 1940's version of George White's Scandals for under forty dollars.",1255824000,8,2242,4.53960396039604
