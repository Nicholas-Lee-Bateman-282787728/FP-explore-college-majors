8337236,4,B001R3YRHQ,"I really think this program should have a rating 4.5 because it cover the latest scientific finding and images sent back by the Japanese lunar orbiter Kaguya. The images are all crystal clear and are displayed with the latest in computer generated graphics! There is good coverage of the moon landings but I thought more footage could have been added of the moon flights. The program goes into the theorized origins of the Earth and the Moon using the latest in computer graphics to demonstrate how scientist believe the Moon form and of the affect of asteroid impacts on the moon. It then has a segment on the plans to return to the Moon and build a base there. I thought the coverage of the technology (spacesuits, habitats rovers and other vehicles) was first rate. Though it only accounted for the last 8.5 minutes of the program. Here too I thought they could have added more content. The program is about 45 minutes in length and has the latest in scientific information, images and CGI. I found this program to be very informative and entertaining! I would recommend to almost anyone with an interest in the Moon (as it covers a lot of different topics), and a good edition to the collection of the space enthusiast! The only negative was that there could have been more content in a couple areas but otherwise a great program!",1390953600,,1334,4.656779661016949
