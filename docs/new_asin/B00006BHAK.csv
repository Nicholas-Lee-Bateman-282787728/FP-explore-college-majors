7966810,1,B00006BHAK,"I would really like to give this movie no stars!!!!!! Or on a scale of 1 to 10: how about a ""negative infinity""!!!

What can I say??????? This is as bad as it gets!!!!! And I am a real Franco fan!!! I am approaching the big 3 - 0!! Meaning: I have seen nearly 30 of his films. There is nothing redeeming about this film!! Not even for fun!!!!

One thing people might like are a couple of extended stripper scenes. With some of the psychedelic music recycled from the Soledad Miranda days!!

How should I say this: this the most recent of Franco's films I have seen. Most of the films of his that I have viewed, you know, were from the sixties and early seventies. The latest was - Oasis of the Zombies (1981).

Where am I going with this?? I hope more of his most recent films are not this bad, it is really a disappointment!!!

One more thing: when you pop the DVD in, there are almost three minutes of lame graphic animation before the menu comes on!!",1399852800,,953,4.214285714285714
7966811,1,B00006BHAK,"This is one of the most unwatchable films that I have ever seen. I was recommended this film by Amazon's automatic system probably because of other low budget movies I have purchased. The title intrigued me, so I bought it. How much I paid is irrelevant: it was too much at any price.

The ""plot"" consists of over the top acting by several scream queens (Linnea Quigley and Michelle Bauer are the only ones who turn in satisfactory performances) involved in bizarre and creepy activities. If you read the back of the DVD box, you will be led to believe that this is a ""crazy and sexy romp filled with outrageous situations and dialogue,"" which is half true: it is filled with outrageous situations and dialogue, but it is neither sexy, nor a romp. It mostly consists of the all too rotund shapes of Lina Romay and Analia Ivars writhing around a spider web for the better part of two hours looking positively vile while thinking up new ways to offend the audience for the better part of two hours. While there is nothing really appealing about this film, it does use a couple of creative devices that redeemed a bit of this mess to a small degree; my favorite being the hilarious special effects largely consisting of the novel spider puppet with a female face and the quirky singing of the ex-boyfriend ensnared in the web, particularly when seen from the spider's viewpoint.

The title is great, the cinematography is generally quite good (far better than much of Franco's catalog, though the transfer to DVD isn't great), and there are a lot of extras, most notably the inclusion of the European version of the film (which I started but couldn't bear to sit all the way through after watching the US version), and the relatively entertaining (and certainly good humored,) commentary and additional footage hosted by Linnea Quigley. The short film ""Les Psycholettes"" is also included, and is as unwatchable, if not more so, than the feature. If you absolutely must see a Jess Franco movie, save yourself the pain of seeing this one. If you are a diehard Franco fan, go ahead and give it a whirl; you are definitely more likely to enjoy it than anyone else, but the odds are still against it.",1079740800,,2192,4.661498708010336
7966812,5,B00006BHAK,"If you are tired of the same old same old, take a look at director Jess Franco's Mari-Cookie and the Killer Tarantula!  I had tried some of Franco's movies from the 1970s (the ones with Christopher Lee as Dracula and Klaus Kinski as Jack the Ripper) but this is nothing like that.  This is one psychedelic trip to a new world of wry comedy and unbounded imagination.  Michelle Bauer is more beautiful now than she ever was -- even better than she was in Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers -- and Linnea Quigley is exquisite.  Lina Romay proves that she is best acting talent that Eurotrash has exported in the last 35 years.  This simply has to be seen to be believed.  This is not for the weak-hearted though.  There's a lot of nudity and some creepy spiders but what's wrong with seeing a lot of beautiful women in a very funny film?",1043798400,9,827,4.437086092715232
7966813,1,B00006BHAK,"Let's start this off by stating that I am NOT a big Jess Franco fan.  So, while I did hate this movie, I suspect that the big fan base that Franco has will love this film.
Mari-Cookie is good in how simply outrageous it is.  There is no attempt to mimic Hollywood.  There is no attempt to present this film as anything but crazed low-budget entertainment.  It IS low-budget.  It IS crazed.  But the filmmaking is so lacking in competency and artistry, the end result is anything but entertaining.  So, despite the insanity - which I admire - this film falls way short.  It was difficult to sit through.
DVD - the transfer is okay; not bad, not great.  The extras are more entertaining than the actual movie, but not nearly good enough to justify buying this disc.  And the menu pages of this DVD are about the most annoying motion menus I've ever been forced to endure.
Jess Franco fans, you may love this DVD.  To the rest of the world: AVOID!!",1035417600,3,945,4.404624277456647
7966814,5,B00006BHAK,"I am a late-comer to the world of Jess Franco.  I had only heard bad things about his films.  When I came to the United States I was suprised to find out that he was still making films.  I though he stopped in the 1980's.  But I find his new production company is still making them fast and furiously.  ""Mari Cookie"" is very funny and sexy and it has wonderful music by lots of cool Spanish bands.  ""Mari Cookie"" must be like a 90 minute trip on LSD with the rock music blaring in the background.  I hope that Franco works more with Michelle Bauer because she is an exciting find.  Many people probably think that Franco and Bauer are relics from the '80s but both are still vibrant and Michelle is more beautiful and talented than ever!  I highly recommend this sarcastic sexy comedy!",999734400,5,785,4.358620689655172
