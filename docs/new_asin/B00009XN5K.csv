The stories are adventurous (this he likes).  They are the right balance of humor and yet convey the times, that the stories represent in history with exceptional accuracy.  As one who has studied history and the Scriptures and likes fun - highly recommended! Also conveys the beauty of living Scripture.  Two thumbs up!",1483228800,,370,4.841269841269841

7994102,5,B00009XN5K,"I purchased the entire Story Keepers DVD collection when our son was born.  I'd seen a preview of the collection on a TV infomercial and was impressed with the engaging cartoons.  Our son is now four years old and he absolutely loves the stories and characters in these wonderful animated Christian DVDs.

The adventures take place in Rome 64 AD.  The main characters are a group of children left orphaned during Nero's cruel persecution of Jerusalem.  The kids are taken in by the kind baker Ben and his loving wife, Helena.  Meeting with other Christians in secret, they tell the stories of fellow believers.  They strive to keep alive the stories of Jesus and they become known as The Story Keepers.

These stories are fast paced, nicely narrated, and very engaging.  The animation is adequately done, though not on a caliber with Disney or the large animation studios.  The backgrounds are more elaborate and much better than the character illustration which is rather plain.

However, the quality of the stories and the endearing characterizations more than make up for the average animation.  As a Christian parent you'll feel confident in sharing these DVDs with your children.",1140825600,15,1184,4.98469387755102
