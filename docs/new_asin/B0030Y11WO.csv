8386192,5,B0030Y11WO,"Amazing, extreme stuff on bike and board.  Truly a different breed, these athletes that is.  I highly recommend it!! Mostly action with commentary interspersed.",1292544000,,160,5.625
8386193,2,B0030Y11WO,"I thought it would be better than the last video of the X-Games, but it was not, was a big disappointment, so much equipment was supposed to be an excellent video. The above video is by far surpasses this. Make no coverage to bmx, with as many variations in that competition and other disciplines such as in-line skate. Disappointing.",1292198400,,334,4.677966101694915
8386194,3,B0030Y11WO,"Good footage and review of the X-Games. However, the Winter X-Games, rollerblading, venues at other places than L.A. are underrepresented in this DVD.
The only winter X games footage we can see is a performance from Shaun White, but what about skiing and snowmobile? all these sports are impressing too!
And what about Taig Khris???
A good point is the quality of the videos, you will love HD TV with this DVD.
Sound is very nice too, but there is no european version of the DVD, subtitles are in spanish or french, and this just for the main movie.

But despite of these drawbacks, I enjoy this DVD and I was waiting for something like this for a long time. Long live the X-Games!",1276041600,,681,4.491935483870968
8386195,5,B0030Y11WO,"I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE X-GAMES TO BE VERY ENTERTAINING. I ADMIRE THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN LIMITATION AND PUSH THEMSELVES TO NOT ONLY BETTER THEMSELVES BUT THEIR SPORTS ASWELL. I SAW THE OLD X GAMES MOVIE-ULTIMATE X- AND THIS IS A PERFECT DEPICTION OF HOW THE SPORT AND THE ATHLETES HAVE EVOLVED. THESE GUYS ARE TRULY AMAZING, JUST TO DROP A FEW NAMES, TRAVIS PASTRANA FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW IS THE BADEST MAN ON THE PLANET IN MY BOOK RIGHT NEXT TO VALENTINO ROSSI! THEY SHOW NOT ONLY HIS PAST STUNTS ON THE BIKE BUT ALSO HIS CURENT PROGRESS WITH SUBURU AND THE MAN IS JUST AS SICK ON 4 WHEELS AS HE IS 2! THERES ALSO THIS NEW KID NAMED KYLE LOZA THAT CAME UP WITH THIS NASTY TRICK I WONT SPOIL IT BUT ITS SICK! SEAN WHITE WILL HAVE YOUR JAW STUCK ON THE FLOOR, HE IS RIDICULOUS ON A SNOWBOARD AND A WINNER OF THE X-GAMES, WINTER GAMES AND OLYMPICS NEED I SAY MORE,THE SKATEBOARDING IS JUST STUPID ITS SO GOOD, AND THEIR ARE SOME FALLS THAT WILL MAKE YOU CRINGE. IT HAS ALOT OF EXTRAS 90 MINUTES IN TOTAL WHICH INCLUDE THE BEST 25 MOMENTS IN X-GAMES HISTORY. THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS WORTH SEEING ON THIS DVD AND WEATHER YOU LIKE THESE SPORTS OR NOT YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED BY THESE ATHLETES THEY'RE UNREAL!",1272412800,,1219,4.258620689655173
