734049,4,6303943349,This is a great couple of dr. who shows. And they are scheduled for release on dvd in 2009. In the uk first of course.  We won't see them till later in that year.,1229731200,,162,3.764705882352941
734050,4,6303943349,"I've never been partial with two-parters, and The Rescue is no exception.  They only serve to fill in the two episodes needed to fill in the season, and as a result, the plots aren't much.  The TARDIS crew land on the planet Dido, where two survivors from an Earth ship, Vicki and Bennett, are awaiting a rescue ship that'll arrive in 69 hours.  The two are under the thrall of the menacing betusked, and clawed Koquillion, a native Didonian who's protecting them from his savage race.  Apparently, the Didonians massacred the remainder of Bennett's crew at a gathering.  Koquillion also seems intent on keeping them hostage.  If he finds out about the rescue ship, he'll kill both Bennett and Vicki.
Yet this doesn't square with the Doctor's earlier [and untelevised] appearance on Dido, where violence was alien to the natives.  So what made the Didonians warlike?  While the leads are good, the story isn't much, serving only to introduce Vicki into the TARDIS crew, and Maureen O'Brien (Vicki) does well in her debut story.  (Rating:  3)
We get a more comedic story in The Romans.  Set in July 64 AD, the Doctor and Vicki, having rested up in a villa, decide to walk to Rome, while Ian and Barbara decide to live up the leisure life drinking wine and eating grapes.  However, Ian and Barbara are kidnapped by two vicious slave traders, the former rowing aboard a slave galley, Barbara sold at a slave auction.  They have a lot to worry about.  ""Have you any idea how the Romans treated their slaves or how many escaped?"" she asks Ian.
The Doctor and Vicki have their share of adventures.  The Doctor is mistaken for a murdered lyre player from Corinth, Maximus Pettulian, who was en route to play before emperor Nero (Derek Francis).  The scene where the Doctor trounces an assassin, engaging in some martial arts is a highlight, with the Doctor putting up quite a fight.  All the fun is at the court of Nero, where the emperor is quite an artistic ham who can be menacing and vindictive one moment, all charms if he's being flattered.  But how does the Doctor get out of performing a concert, especially as he does not know how to play the lyre?  However, Nero has fun chasing after the slave for his wife Poppeia, newly procured by Tavius, his court buyer.  It's none other than Barbara, and he goes after her laughing like a schoolboy.  He even has a pratfall which causes Vicki to cover her face as she laughs.  However, his petulance is actually funny:  ""I'll have you both killed over and over again!  I'll stick you two in an arena on an island with water all around, and in the water will be alligators, and the water level will be raised and the alligators will get you!""
Tavius (Michael Peake) is a key character here.  He's the kindly man who buys Barbara because of her kind treatment to an ill fellow slave.  ""Most people under such circumstances would've looked after themselves.""  However, Tavius and the real Pettulian are clearly involved in some sort of intrigue, which the Doctor, mistaken for Pettulian, becomes caught up in.  Tavius also has his comedic moment, as he hisses loudly for the Doctor when he wants a word.  ""Oh, it's our hissing friend again,"" says the Doctor.
Another interesting aspect is the ethics involving the role of the court poisoner.  Vicki learns that such things are accepted, part of tradition.  And she is lectured by the Doctor when she wants to wander around the court:  ""We must not interfere with the course of progress or try to accelerate man's achievements or progress.""
Trivia:  Episode 3 of this show aired later than the scheduled time due to coverage of Winston Churchill's funeral.
This is a spoof of a spoof, as writer Dennis Spooner based it on Carry On Cleo, which was itself a spoof of Quo Vadis?.  The Romans is a fun episode clearly based on laughs rather than historical accuracy.  Nero here is a portly middle-aged man, while the historical Nero was twenty-seven and at Actium, not Rome, when the fire started.  And since when did Roman coins look like metal washers?

734051,4,6303943349,"This is the first of three double cassette packages to contain two separate adventures for Doctor Who.  Now, The Rescue, is little more than a filler adventure used for introducing a new companion to the series, now that Susan is long gone.  The character of Vicki, a plucky, emotional, curious, strong-minded, kind-hearted young woman, who would basically become an adoptive granddaughter for the Doctor.  The Romans is an enjoyable historical adventure as the TARDIS crew land in the final days of Rome, during the reign of Caesar Nero.  The crew spend about a month in relative ease and relaxation before deciding to split up and travel to Rome.  what follows in an extraordinary comedic adventure, as the Doctor and Vicki travel to Rome and become embroiled in a conspiracy to assassinate Nero, with the good Doctor mistakenly taken to be Maximus Petullian, while Ian and Barbara are sold as slaves.  it's a fabulous adventure as the character of Nero is made up to be a fat, perverted, blustering, cowardly, power driven, and ultimately insane.  and the scene in which Nero is given the notion to burn all of Rome is both funny & frightening.  definitely a must to have for Doctor Who afficianados.",1042588800,7,1203,4.891625615763547
734052,3,6303943349,"Try as I might I cannot find a whole lot good to say about The Rescue save that it does not have Susan screaming throughout. That is perhaps a little unfair but this is a below par performance. William Hartnell is on good form but that cannot make up for the ropey story line and a lightweight production.
The Romans is by far and away a superior story with an odd characterisation of how Nero came to fiddle with Rome burning. It is quite a clever angle but is a little incredulous given the timeframes of the individual sub-plots. That is a minor negative about this story which is actually rather a compelling view. I was never terribly interested in most of the historical stories but this one is the exception.
Originally broadcast between 2 january 1965  and 6 February, this 2 cassette set is certainly worth having for the Romans alone. What did the Romans do for us?
It is such a shame that some of the best stories are lost to posterity yet the Rescue is still available.",1025913600,4,981,4.45
734053,4,6303943349,"A period of transition for Doctor Who as the first story not featuring granddaughter Susan is unveiled.  In The Rescue, the Doctor, Ian and Barbara land on a planet where a young girl named Vicki is held captive by an alien menace named Quoquilion.  After rescuing her, the four travel to the time of The Romans where the Doctor inadvertantly gives Nero the idea to burn Rome.  Both stories are well written, the later, The Romans, being played mostly for laughs that work well.  This is a welcome addition to a Doctor Who collection and an important piece of its history.",983664000,7,572,4.633663366336633
734054,4,6303943349,"""The Rescue"" The TARDIS crew lands on a planet where they find a wrecked spaceship with only two survivors. Terrorized by a mysterious alien, the Doctor and his friends attempt to discover the truth and attempt a daring rescue. Collector's Note: This story features the first appearance of Vicki, the first ""new"" companion in the show's history.
""The Romans"" After an extended vacation in ancient Rome, the TARDIS crew is separated into two adventures: The Doctor and Vicki become involved with the court of the notorious Emperor Nero, while Ian and Barbara are captured and sold as slaves!
William Hartnell's time as the Doctor is as entertaining today as it was over 35 years ago. In the title role, Hartnell is superbly cast, portraying an elderly man with a keen desire for exploration. Despite his occasional fluffs (See The Romans), he delivers the lines with all of the wit and urgency necessary. It is easy to see why each of the actors who followed him owe much to his portrayal. As Ian, Willam Russell is wonderful. In many ways, he is as influential as Hartnell, performing the stunts and action that would become so important to the series' success. Jackie Hill's Barbara is also fondly remembered. Along with Russell, Hill portrayed a humanity that opposed Hartnell's gruff and heartless Doctor. By the time these episodes aired, Ian and Barbara had mellowed the Doctor somewhat, bringing out his ""humanity,"" another hallmark of the series. Maureen O'Brien, introduced here as Vicki, is given the thankless job of being the screaming young woman who gets captured, falls into traps, etc. She portrays it well, and has a great many amusing scenes with Hartnell's Doctor.
These stories are drastically different, but represent the dual nature of early Doctor Who. ""The Rescue"" is a sci-fi romp, complete with aliens and spacecraft. While not the greatest example from this series, today's viewers may still find it interesting. Of more general interest may be the set's dual opposite ""The Romans,"" which is one of the ""historical"" dramas where the TARDIS lands at a crucial place in our history, often converging with historical figures. Though not completely accurate, it does show a fair sampling of what life was like in Roman Times without skimping on the trademark adventure. I personally prefer ""The Romans,"" mostly for Hartnell's performance. This was in the show's second season, during it's first wave of popularity. Hartnell is obviously enjoying being a children's hero and his enthusiasm is infectious. This tape provides many hours of fun and adventure, suitable for the whole family.",979171200,12,2608,5.081585081585081
734055,5,6303943349,"The Rescue was ok, with a predictable plot, I knew who the villian was from the first. The Romans was the most enjoyable episode I have seen thus far. The plot was great, the sets were good. Entertaining from beginning to  end.",939513600,,227,4.404761904761905
734056,4,6303943349,"""The Rescue"" is really pretty bad, even by the standards of the Hartnell era. The book of the same is quite good though, because it has more depth, and because you don't have to suffer through the terrible FX of the video. However, it is worth buying this 2-tape set due to the strength of ""The Romans"" alone. ""Romans"" is the only Hartnell story that was intentionally made as a comedy, and it's highly entertaining! Although most of the time you will only be amused by the slapstick and situation comedy, sometimes you will roar with laughter! It is interesting that the story is balanced with some tension, seriousness and suspense as well. Even the bloopers add to the comedy, such as when Hartnell unknowingly mispronounces ""Montana"". This is a must-see, and one that you can watch again and again. 2-stars for ""The Rescue"".... 4.5-stars for ""The Romans"".  END",900892800,,864,4.798657718120805

734134,5,6303943349,"This is getting ridiculous, classic Doctor Who DVD's going for $50.00 to $100.00 or more is just insane. I saw that one of the best Hartnell era stories The Romans was going up in price so I ordered it quick.
For me there are only a handful of essential Hartnell stories available on DVD and those are: An Unearthly Child, The Daleks, The Aztecs, Planet of Giants, The Space Museum, The Romans, Dalek Invasion of Earth and The War Machines.
The rest I don't care about, The Web Planet is slow and boring and goofy and The Time Meddler is a mediocre story at best and definitely not worth $130.00!!!! it's barely worth $25.00...

For those who don't already own the Hartnell episodes I mentioned and consider themselves huge Doctor Who fans I do feel sorry for you because you're missing out!!!! The Romans is on par in comedy and drama and characterization and acting with any of the best Who episodes being produced today... Nero is devilishly naughty, The Doctor is amusingly indifferent, Vicki is there mainly just to keep him out of trouble. But if you are a fan of the classic series at all this is where Ian and Barbara truly shine. The writing overall is superb and whimsically comic in a way I never knew Doctor Who could ever be and I was so surprised to see how playful and clever the story flowed on the my first viewing ... for me The Romans will always be one of the best Doctor Who stories of all time and what's great is that it survived complete.

734198,5,6303943349,"The Rescue and the Romans. I've had this pair of stories in so many forms. Taped off of a PBS broadcast in the mid 1980's in ep mode. Re-taped on super VHS in sp mode in the late 1980's. Bought the BBC VHS release in the early 1990's and burned a DVD copy made as a disk image of the VHS release in the early 2000's.
  I liked it so much that I bought the new BBC DVD release!
It better never come out on bluray!
  So what does that say about these two stories? Well, not much as I have done similar things for almost all old Doctor Who. But these two are special.
  To sum up the plot, as every reviewer should, The Doctor has just left his granddaughter, Susan, on a dalek ravaged earth to marry some bloke named David with only one shoe (Hers. We presume that David still has both his shoes). The Doctor is a bit distant as they arrive on the Planet Dido where strange things are happening (when aren't they?) to recriut a new companion, Vicki. They then travel to Nero's Rome to have a bit of fun and rest.
  That may be a lackluster synopsis, but I refuse to give the plot away in case someone hasn't seen it.
The restoration is on par with all the other restorations of old Doctor who. There are spots of dirt in the film that weren't removed and this story hasn't undergone vidfire process. It looks good enough though and they corrected the wavy picture problems in the first episode.
  I believe that the marketing arm of the BBC & 2 Entertain think the Black & white Doctor Who stories have a very limited value. It's true, on the short term, but this is Doctor Who. Sooner or later the real fans of the current series will be curious to see what happened in the past. I know because I did the same thing. I started watching in the Tom Baker era and I love the older stuff just as much as the newest stuff.
  I feel old now.
  This is the first Doctor at his finest, which sums up most of the original second series. Honestly, can you imagine doing as much television every year as this cast and crew did? The extras, as always, give you good reason to replace your old VHS tapes or whatever.
  I bought this DVD with ""The Space Museum and The Chase"" set and it's a great ride. Completists (like me) may want to go a bit further and watch all the second season in order.(except ""Planet of the Giants"" whch has never been officially released that I know of, but is out there in digital form, made from really bad vhs tapes like mine.)
  The stories flow together through the season, and not just the cliffhanger at the end of an episode. To say more gives away the plot, just think of the new series... it's a bit like that.
""Planet of the Giants"" is a great idea done at the wrong time. The effects work somewhat but the plot is a bit thin.
""Dalek Invasion of Earth"" is a dark and deadly world of the future (Touche'! it's a Cliche'!)
""The Rescue"" is a short mystery with many questions left unanswered.
""The Romans"" brings a lot more fun and humor into the series.
""The Web Planet"" is ambitious with a gripping Science Fiction story and a limited budget. Many casual viewers find it difficult to watch.
""The Crusade"" (Available in the ""Lost in Time"" Boxset) again brings back a touch of the humor after the serious Web planet story, although Ian and Barbara have a rough time.
""The Space Museum"" is a bit of a letdown after the first episode, but they can't all be gems.
""The Chase"" is brilliant in most parts which makes up for the weaker elements.
""The Time Meddler"" wraps up the season with no money, but a brilliant performance. Some questions are answered about The Doctor but we find more things we don't know about him.
  It is a rare treat to enjoy this many early Doctor Who stories together as a complete season. Season one is missing all seven ""Marco Polo"" episodes and two episodes of ""The Reign of Terror"". Also, ""The Sensorites"" has never been officially released to video. As for season three, only 16 episodes out of the 45 episodes made exist, thats  three complete stories and a few scattered episodes.
  It gets worse as Season Four has no complete stories and Season Five only has ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" as a complete story. Things get better for Patrick Troughton's final year, but even the Sixth Season has gaps.

If you enjoy the show already, I don't need to convince you to buy this. But if you are allergic to old Doctor Who or break out in hives watching old 425 line black and white programmes on your new 54inch HD TV, keep in mind that these stories were filmed week after week with no breaks with no cgi and no retakes. They make it out like it's a hard job to make new Doctor who but it is nothing in comparison to all that's gone on before. It truly boggles the mind!
A little long-winded but I covered the whole second season!",1301184000,,4771,4.299107142857143
734199,4,6303943349,"This is a double storyline. First we are given a short two parter in which we are introduced to Susan's replacement Vicki. The story is filled with filler, and yet still two parts. The story itself is weak at best, but does as actor William Russell states allow Vicki's character to show us who she is, and what's she's made of. Furthermore, this story provides us with a vehicle to give the doctor a replacement for Susan his granddaughter, as she becomes the first true companion for the doctor. The storyline itself is very predictable (figured it out within the first few minutes).

The second story ""The Romans"" is somewhat better, though also very slow and monotonous at times. As is most frequently the case in the classic Dr. Who stories, much is predictable (though, I have to admit, I had seen this one before.) I had seen this many years ago on a poorly receiving aerial TV with so much snow that I could barely make out what they were saying let alone what I was seeing. So, I had, for years wanted to see it much more clearly. I have to admit I was greatly disappointed and surprised at the same time. There is one thing that happens in ""The Romans"" which explains a comment made by the Doctor in a later David Tennant story called ""The Fires Of Pompeii."" {Spoiler Below}Now, a younger man's growing expectations over the years, should not foreshadow the value of these two DVD's. They are decent, even good stories, I am certain. I just had higher expectations, perhaps. Either way, as a serious Dr. Who fan and collector, I would not/could not have done without these in my collection. My goal is to own on DVD all of the Dr. Who's out there. I have 63 dvd's so far, plus all four seasons of the remakes of Dr. Who with Christopher Eccelston, and David Tennant.

{Spoiler}
The comment David Tennant makes in ""The Fires Of Pompeii"" regarding being the cause and giving Nero the idea to burn Rome are not only explained but show in the final episode of ""The Romans"".

734200,3,6303943349,"""The Rescue"" was  a milestone for Doctor Who, introducing the first new companion for the Doctor to replace Susan, one of the original companions from the first season. Straight out of the gate, Maureen O'Brien demonstrates serious acting chops as Vicki, a teenage orphan stranded when her spaceship crashes on the planet Dido.

If you turn on the commentary, you learn that the BBC and producer Verity Lambert were wrangling over whether to grant O'Brien a four-week or 13-week contract. The network was seriously considering canceling the show after one season even though it was steadily attracting more than 10 million viewers a week and consistently ranking in the top 10 most-viewed programs. The Doctor wouldn't attain such high ratings again until well into the Tom Baker years.

""The Rescue"" is well done for what it is--a simple, two-episode story that introduces Vicki before moving on to the four-part ""The Romans."" The latter story was intended as a humorous treatment of life under the Caesars in which the Doctor inadvertently inspires the Emperor Nero to burn down Rome. Between all the arson, slave-trading, death by poison, gladiatorial combat and imperial philandering, I guess I forgot to laugh. But it is cleverly plotted, with the Doctor and Vicki becoming separated from Ian and Barbara, the two pairs narrowly missing each other as they undergo a series of harrowing adventures, before reuniting in the end.

If the humor of ""The Romans"" falls a little flat, there are at least a few Special Features on this two-disc set worth noting: a brief tribute to writer Dennis Spooner, who contributed to several stylish TV series of the '60s, including ""The Avengers""; and ""Girls! Girls! Girls!"", a 17-minute retrospective on the Doctor's female companions from that decade. Some of these women, such as Jean Marsh, were not companions in the strictest sense (Marsh's character died in her first story), but it's good to see so many of the actresses interviewed about their experiences on the show.",1271894400,,2015,5.078549848942598
734201,5,6303943349,"First, let me say that you should treat the two stories as one.  Really, the first story, The Rescue introduces us to Vicki, a new companion to the Doctor.  The next story, The Romans, introduces Vicki to adventure, danger, and the whole idea of what travelling with the Doctor will be like.
In fact, director Christopher Barry directed both, giving it feel and style that allows you to watch all six episodes in one sitting.
When it comes down to it, I love the Roman episodes.  I love Roman history, I love ancient history, and I enjoy a good historical drama made by the BBC.  Let's face it, they have warehouses of togas, swords and Roman sets, you know they love doing this kind of thing.  The fact that the characters are split up gives us three story lines for the price of one.  Jacqueline Hill and William Russell's characters are shown as smart, brave, and funny.  They hold their own even without the Doctor around.
I also think Maureen O'Brien does a very good Vicki - she is able to really get emotional and act in The Rescue episodes.  Sadly, to my knowledge her character didn't stay as long as many of the companions.
Together the two stories, with few flaws, make one huge wonderful story with many merits!",1265068800,,1223,4.527272727272727
734250,4,6303943349,"This is a nice double-DVD set to own. You get two stories for a reasonable price and a look into the world of Doctor Who during the black and white '60's.  A lot of reviewers seem to like ""The Romans"" over ""The Rescue.""  For me it is the other way around.  ""The Rescue"" is a two-parter mainly designed to bring Vicki into the series.  But the sets utilized were fabulous and believable for an all in-studio recording.  The extras on the first DVD are almost nothing.  You get a halfway decent behind the scenes documentary and a photo album.  The PDF of the set designs shows just how much thought went into creating this one.

""The Romans"" is an amusing historical piece that is well directed and blocked.  The Doctor and Vicki are never supposed to run into Barbara and Ian and that is handled admirably.  The story never did much for me as it is a predictable romp that is entrenched in the cliches and imagery of Nero's Rome.  I happen to like the extras more than the story on this second DVD.  The behind the scenes documentary takes a wider look at the BBC's portrayal of Ancient Rome as a whole. There is also a wonderful tribite to writer Dennis Spooner and a fun piece about the Who women of the 1960's. Even the obligatory ""Blue Peter"" feature about the way Ancient Romans ate their meals is fascinating to watch.

This is not a bad set for the price but it is really for true Who fans only.",1259971200,,1402,4.346153846153846
734251,4,6303943349,"these 2 episodes were consecutive in airing and were also released as a set on Video so that isn't anything new.  the transfer is of course cleaner and the digital ""reconstruction"" of the film to video motion is moticiable if you have the VHS to compare with.
The prior reviews here gives perfect epsidoe summaries.  Rescue is exposed as a pure filler episode (but the set design expence shows it was not a budgetary constraint story) to explain how Vicky joins the crew.  William hartnell's emotive performance is very good you very much beleive his is a grandfather who misses his grandchild in the first few minutes as the departure of Susan is recapped.

Romans is the real gem.  haveing seen every Classic story that still exists (and the still/clips plus audio reconstructions of the ones that don't) it is my abosulute favorite Historical episode.  When compared to Aztecs (on dvd) or Reign of Terror (on vhs only) you can see just how far the production team had come.  The set design is lavish for the period.  The scripts are very good with humor abundant from Mr Hartnell (showing his comedy backround) and Nero.  if all the historical stories had been as good maybe they wouldn't have stopped making them with Highlanders and the Davison era black orchid.
in the commentary William Russel is cogent and funny making me wonder why the current show hasn't seen fit to bring him in as a guest.",1254787200,,1402,4.713114754098361
734252,4,6303943349,"One of the better Hartnell features.  Introduces the character of Vickie.  Particularly good is the Roman episode, one of the best of the historical Hartnell stories, with suitable intrigue combined with lavish (for the time and budget) sets, and a good amount of humour sprinkled in, as well.  The Ian-Barbara scenes are particularly good, and the way the story is constructed and executed, like a classic baudy French farce, is delightful.  The special features are quite informative, as well.  The supporting roles of Nero and the slave-buyer who helps Barbara escape are particularly well-played and written, and there are some genuine moments of peril and tension, as well as bonding and sacrifice, features that would continue to be strongly emphasized throughout the series.  A good episode to show those rather new to the show, as both stories are short.",1250208000,,862,5.16546762589928
734253,3,6303943349,This was a real twist as I expected from Doctor Who marathon behind the scenes clips that The Romans would be the better of the two. However I found upon watching it that while The Romans was a interesting story where Barbara is sold as a slave and has to escape on her own as doctor learns nothing about it I find The Rescue that first introduces character Vicki to be much more enjoyable story.,1249776000,3,396,4.293333333333333

With so many of the early Dr Who episodes stupidly burned, it is great to see these early related stories presented so well on dvd. I have them on VHS, but think having the DVD a better viewing experience.",1249689600,,324,4.803571428571429
734255,4,6303943349,"This double-pack is occasioned only by the fact that these two stories were made back-to-back.  However, it's a neat little window on ""Doctor Who""'s radical early days -- a two-episode outer-space character piece set 500 years in the future, followed by a 4-episode romp through Ancient Rome.  ""Doctor Who""'s genius then and now is its willingness to try absolutely any form of drama, making it up as it goes along and succeeding most of the time.

""The Rescue"" is basically a filler episode designed to introduce a replacement character for original companion Susan.  Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) is a teenage orphan from the 25th Century.  Marooned on the planet Dido, Vicki finds herself menaced by a reptilian biped with the unlikely name of Koquilion.  There's a mystery in the middle of all this, which the Doctor solves without breaking a sweat.  It helps that he's been to Dido before... The script hasn't held up very well, but director Christopher Barry (previously seen helming ""The Daleks"") adds some inventive directorial flourishes.

This is one of the restoration team's ""lite"" releases so there's not a whole lot going on in the extra features.  Maureen O'Brien, who played Vicki for parts of two seasons (before the character went off to help found the city of Rome) pops up very briefly in the making-of documentary, but not in the commentary track.

Speaking of Rome, the other episode in the case has held up shockingly well.  ""The Romans"" was ""Doctor Who""'s first foray into farce.  William Hartnell's Doctor gets to play comedy for the first time, and kicks into overdrive -- palling around with Caesar Nero, unsuccessfuly learning how to play the lyre, and demonstrating the fine art of fisticuffs (which, we learn, he once taught to the Mountain Mauler of Montana).  He gets to deliver some comedic zingers, and even his line-readin fluffs add to the charm.  The main guest character, Nero, also gets a slew of terrific lines (""I'll have you killed over and over again!"") and plenty of wonderful character moments (not the least of which is his creative disposal of an overzealous cup-bearer).

The story itself has a huge scope; each individual half-hour seems to have its own mini-plot and unique settings.  From the rural marketplace to the slave galley to gladiators in the arena to the burning of Rome, ""The Romans"" moves along at a breakneck pace more befitting the 2005 revival of ""Doctor Who"" than something from 45 years ago.

The extras on the ""Romans"" disk are of the deluxe variety.  The making-of featurette is over half an hour long and puts the story in its historical context.  ""Doctor Who"" in its first two years was an extremely radical program, and if it all looks slow and dull and black-&-white today, this documentary will quickly disabuse you of that viewpoint.  Also charming is a featurette on Dennis Spooner, the writer of the story and ""Doctor Who""'s second script editor; the MVP of this extra is current ""Who"" writer Rob Shearman, who makes a far-reaching but convincing argument that the show wouldn't have survived this long without Spooner's creativity and risk-taking.  There's also an overview on ""Who""'s female companions throughout the 1960s decade (demonstrated in this story by the strong-willed schoolteacher Barbara, and the sweet but innocent future-girl Vicki).  Finally there's a crowded commentary booth, moderated by British comedian Toby Hadoke, who's much more lively that previous Hartnell-episode-commentary-track moderators.",1249171200,10,3493,5.112676056338028
734256,5,6303943349,"It's fitting that these two stories are released as a double CD set, as that is how the VHS version was released in the states.  The Rescue basically serves as an introductory tale for new companion, Vickie, not short for Victoria, just Vickie, V-I-C-K-I-E.  The Doctor clearly misses his granddaughter Susan who, at the end of the last story left The TARDIS crew to be with freedom fighter David Campbell to start a new life and rebuild an Earth ravaged by the Daleks.  Vickie was cast to be a replacement for Susan, someone on whom the Doctor can exercise his grandfather instincts.  The story is fairly decent, a tale of cover-up and betrayal, with someone Vickie trusts implicitly acting as the villain trying save himself from a murder charge.

The real greatness lies in The Romans, a story evidently played out as a comedy, with plenty of witty dialogue and merry mishaps, though not without more serious, dramatic moments. The subplot of Ian and Barbara sold into slavery certainly is not funny, and is given proper attention, with the viciousness of the Romans clearly conveyed.  The plot in which the Doctor is mistaken for lyre player Maximus Pettulius is one of the highlights of the 60s, played for laughs, and William Hartnell gives a standout performance in this role.  His interplay with Derek Francis (Nero) is tremendous, both actors very adept at the comedic role. There is plenty of play on words with the pun Lyre/Liar, and Maureen O'Brien's facial expressions as she understands the Doctor's hidden jokes are priceless.  In the end, as we have seen with other later stories of the world of Doctor Who influencing real-world history, it is implied by Vickie that it was the Doctor who gave Nero the idea to burn Rome, and admonishing him for breaking his own rules of not interfering.  At first the Doctor is indignant. ""You can't possibly accuse me of all this"", he rages pointing to the burning city. Then after second thought, has a change of heart, and accepts the possibility with a sly chuckle.

Perhaps the most poignant, moving scene in The Romans occurs at the end, when Barbara's benefactor, Tavius, who seems to have ulterior motives for wanting to help, reveals the true reason of his kindness.  As Ian and Barbara make their escape, he eencourages them, clutching to his concealed cross, which he dares not reveal in Nero's palace for fear of becoming ferocious-feline fodder.  Tavius is a Christian and that motivates him to help our heroine in distress.",1249171200,2,2489,4.84433962264151
734257,4,6303943349,"It really is a shame that Who producers did away with the historic episodes.  The original intent of the show was to alternate historic episodes with ""regular"" episodes.  And some of the histpric episodes done are just top notch, as if the writers on these preferred the stories to the sci fi stuff.  The best example of this is probably the Aztecs, whcih is one of Hartnell's finest episodes.  The Romans is also quite a good watch, although it doesn't quite rise to the level of the Aztecs.  The actors seems to be having a lot of fun here, and there is a bit of comedy woven into the Doctor's performance that wasn't present in other episodes.  I for one prefer Hartnell and serious, even scary.  When you never knew what he was going to do next, including tossing you off of his ""ship,"" he was incredible.  Still, the Romans delivers.  As for the rescue, it is alos very entertaining and a good example of why theseries caught on as it did",1248393600,2,943,4.436046511627907
734258,3,6303943349,"The previous reviews have already offered summaries of the stories, so I won't bother.

The Rescue is a pleasant, if unenthralling 2 parter, serving mostly to introduce a new companion, the charming and sweet faced Vicki.

The Romans is the series' first excursion into comedy. And, unlike some later attempts (can you say Season 17...) it works very well. A nice mix of humor and drama and, as an historical, no dodgy special effects to worry about. I've always been a fan of the historicals .. now I'm just waiting for them to release ""Reign of Terror,"" and I'll be a happy fan.

Some pleasant extras as well, detailed 'making of' documentaries about each episode, commentary tracks, and some fun stuff like the Roman Banquet. (Anyone know when that dates from? Being in color, it obviously wasnt' contemporary with the Dr. Who story.)

My one complaint with the set is that disc one is over  half empty.  There is barely an hour's worth of material on it!  (One 20 minute documentary and a 2 part, 45 minute story.) By contrast, disc two has almost 3 hours. Couldn't they have found something to fill the space?  Like... maybe ""Planet of Giants""? (A 3 parter that comes from the same season ... would have been a perfect fit.)",1247702400,12,1229,4.657407407407407
734259,3,6303943349,"Two classic adventures from the William Hartnell era.

The Rescue:

This is a two-part story introducing new companion Vicki. The TARDIS lands on the planet Dido where the Doctor and his companions discover a crashed spaceship. The only survivors are a young orphaned girl named Vicki and an injured man named Bennett who both live in fear of a hideous alien named Koquillion. Who is this strange creature that they fear, and will they remain safe long enough to be rescued?

This is a nice little adventure, and made an enjoyable two-parter. The only thing that disappoints is the crappy-looking spaceship, and although Koquillion looks rather frightening, once you hear him speak for the first time in that squeaky little voice, the frightening effect is lost rather quickly. But still the plot is good, the story is rather moody, it has a great surprise ending, and although the spaceship wasn't that impressive, the rest of the sets and special effects were pretty good. In all, I wouldn't consider this one of the best ""Dr. Who"" stories of all time, but it was still worthy and enjoyable. Three stars.

The Romans:

The Doctor and his companions take a holiday in ancient Italy. But trouble soon comes calling when the Doctor takes Vicki to Rome and finds himself being mistaken for the musician Maximus Pettulian, and forced to play for the Emperor Nero, or face execution while Ian and Barbara are kidnapped and sold into slavery. Barbara becomes a handmaiden for Nero and Ian is forced to fight as a gladiator in the arena. Can they escape and find the Doctor before all of Rome is consumed by fire?

Some consider this four-part ""Dr. Who"" to be the best of all time while others consider this one to be the worst. In fact, it's both. The first half of the story was boring as hell. No real excitement and not a lot of comedy, but the second half... boy was that good! Lots of funny comedy and lots of excitement! Sets and performances are great, and although this one was a cheap story to make, it looks like a million bucks due to the production reusing old reusable sets and due to a brilliant director. In all, like ""The Rescue"", this might not have been the best ""Dr. Who"" ever made, but it was still worthy and enjoyable too. Three stars.",1247356800,5,2252,4.631578947368421

The first story is a two part story called The Rescue. It is written in a suspense-mystery style and introduced the Doctor's new companion, Vicki. I found it to be rather decently written and it held a very good suspense aura throughout the story.

The second story is a 4 parter called The Romans. This was a slight departure for the series at the time as it was more a comedy but still it was well done and keeps you interested. It was also one of the historical stories and was rather accurate although some things such as a banquet was inaccurate due to studio space and production needs.
