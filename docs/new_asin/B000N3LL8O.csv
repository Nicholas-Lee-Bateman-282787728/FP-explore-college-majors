I haven't yet purchased this import DVD but if it is as good as those who have said it is, then they'd better be telling the truth because this is one movie IN AMERICA that I wish would RErelease it so I can get it.  But anyway, it is still a good movie and though the first one was better than this one, this one still has the same flavor as the first.  The only thing is, one returning cast member comes in this one and that Meshach Taylor as Hollywood Montrose.  Also, the building PRINCE & CO. returns.  In this Mannequin, William Ragsdale has two parts in the beginning of the movie as Prince William who falls for the Enchanted Peasant girl Jessie Kristy Swanson and when his mother the queen doesn't approve she dispatches Terry Kiser who has two parts Sorceror to put a evil necklace on her that would freeze her for a thousand years or until a true love can free her of the spell.  Once that has happened, years have past and she ends up in a tour display and they say that the legend is not true but, a count by the name of Spretzel (also played by Terry Kiser) of the country this all originated from Homptman-Koenig, he tries to get her for himself.  And a new employee at Prince & Co. where the presentacion as Hollywood pronounces it, takes place Jason Williamson (also played by William Ragsdale) discovers the Enchanted Peasant girl and sees she's come to live but at this point does NOT know that the necklace was the source of her freezing.  And he does all he can to save her and falls in love with her at the end.  There are some funny parts and there are some stupid parts but, still this movie does deserve a DVD RErelease and hopefully in America it will but right now it is an import and if this thing IS an ALL region as the seller is boasting then I want it!!!! I think Kristy Swanson is however very sexy in this.",1181520000,2,1918,4.204359673024523
