8090501,5,B000BP8XXU,"The item shown here is tape of the original Japanese VHS release for Sailor Moon, and an official Japanese product. None of the Japanese VHS/Laserdisc/DVD releases have subtitles.

I don't actually own this particular tape, but I think it contains episodes 55-58 (as those are the episodes the corresponding Laserdisc version of the volume contains). Which, yes, are episodes from the Doom Tree/Hell Tree arc of the second season of Sailor Moon.",1290902400,,445,5.180555555555555
8090502,3,B000BP8XXU,"While admittedly I haven't actually viewed this at all, just seeing its cover-picture (including the ""two new enemies"" flanking Sailor Moon:) helps me figure that it's a collection of stories regarding The Doom Tree and the two young aliens who come with it, (English names) Allen and Anne. From what I remember of the (probably edited;) American-TV cartoons, these stories are pretty good. Very cool art-treatment of the mysterious & dangerous Doom Tree ('course, naturally that'd interest me, as I'm a graphic-artist myself:).",1148256000,,528,5.373493975903615
