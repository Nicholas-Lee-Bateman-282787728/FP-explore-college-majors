5838110,5,B00DOB3N56,"Average video and sound quality for Blu-ray.  Below average supplements and extras: the singular well done extra explains how the film was made via the production crew, actors, and even the eyes and throat (unslahshed of course) of one of the ""victims"". It's interesting to note that director Carpenter looked so young during the filming but has aged (virtually) even less gracefully than the poor fellow left dangling on the wall. This movie is a horror classic with some shortcomings.  Nevertheless, the spooky atmosphere and Carpenter's music score are so strong that it retains an overall ""5 star"" rating. The movie would have been much classier by starting the film with the psychiatrist's (the wonderful Donald Pleasence) drive to the mental hospital, and eliminating the truly sickening visual of such a young child doing something so hideous! In retrospect, if the shot of the child's face had been been eliminated--this would have left much more to the audiences imagination instead of such a vivid and sickening image of (the face of) a child dressed in a clown costume. Another option would be to keep the clown mask on the child--Again to intensify the spooky atmosphere and audience imagination. By seeing the child's face, it also make it less mysterious and scary. Likewise, the face of the stalker/boogeyman/psychopath should never have been revealed either! Ironically, the face shown as the stalker is not even really the same person who had actually done the stalking throughout the movie! On the positive side, the ""ghost wearing glasses"" scene is the epitome of an imaginative, creative, scary, and even humorous idea that was perfectly executed. The sequence of events that followed were fun and surprising, and pulled out all the stops! The movie pulls into full gear from that point on, and what follows the rest of the way (until the mask comes off) is perfect execution by the genius of Carpenter with significant contributions from the late, great Debra Hill, the technical crew, and a fine cast of young actors. For those who enjoy this movie, I would strongly suggest purchasing a little gem from 1974 entitled ""Black Christmas"":  it's a more effective horror film (leaving more to the imagination) although it remains relatively obscure. ""Halloween"" is amazingly frightening but a question: why did trick or treaters fail to show up at any of the two featured houses? This is a noticable flaw that begs the question: ""Was it really Halloween or do we need another, better, more reliable sequel?""",969753600,,2525,5.0503597122302155

5838114,5,B00DOB3N56,"This Blu-ray version improves on the preceding Blu-ray release. Much of the improvement is in color. The original Blu-ray release of Halloween featured tropical greens and screaming primaries. During the first half hour of this version, you'll notice less saturation and overall brighter neutral tones, more greys and off-whites. Once the movie transitions into darkness after its first 30 minutes, you might not notice as many dramatic differences between this 35th Anniversary version and the previous version. I never said you won't notice ANY differences during all the pitch-dark mayhem, just not as many.

The box states that the audio is now Dolby 7.1, but I'm listening to the new soundtrack on my Audio-Technica M50's and I can't tell much difference between this version, the previous Blu-ray version, or (for that matter) the 25th Anniversary edition on DVD.

The 35th anniversary edition also comes with a small hardcover book that looks strangely like one of those old children's books that usually featured Curious George or Babar The Elephant. The short essay included is very good--much better than the usual PR material we're all used to. It reads like it may have actually been commissioned for this release. It also reads like the person who wrote it (I don't recognize the name) may actually be an intelligent and educated person who knows what she's talking about. The black-and-white photos of Carpenter, cast, and crew on the original set (which I've never seen before) show everyone to be having a great time.

I bought this edition at Best Buy for $11.99 and I'd have to say it is worth the price if Halloween has always been one of your favorite movies. The previous Blu-ray edition I bought for $7.99. If you don't mind all that juicy, distracting color in the first 30 minutes, then you might be happy with the previous version and you could save yourself roughly five bucks. If you still have your 25th Anniversary DVD--with all those great bonus features--you might want to keep it. The 25th Anniversary DVD and the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray look very similar, especially in terms of sharpness. I'm glad that I bought this most recent edition, but I still can't decide how much it really improves over the 25th Anniversary edition.",1446336000,2,2260,4.989389920424403

5838123,5,B00DOB3N56,"Let's face it, Halloween is my all-time personal favorite scary movie, alongside Black Christmas ('74) and The Haunting ('63). For the past 36 years, this movie's been talked about so much, that there's not much else to say about it except, ""I love 'Halloween'""

But anyway, I thank you, Amazon, very much for this 35th Anniversary Blu-Ray Edition. :D  I'd prefer the original poster to be used as its cover art; it would make the poster look more awesome. But the disc is perfect; 0% problems. The picture and audio quality is great, crystal-clear; seeing Michael's mask shine under the blue-tinted light on the Blu-Ray is really good. I love the concept of the booklet giving us behind-the-scenes info revolving around the movie and its genesis, but I keep my disc in a normal DVD box, cause I don't want to risk the disc getting scratched when sliding it out of the booklet.

But other than that, I'm glad to have this edition in my collection. Thank you, Amazon. I am a loving customer of yours, and I'll still be around to buy more movies from y'all. ;)

5838146,4,B00DOB3N56,"This is a nice movie, while I'm a not a huge fan, it's rightfully landed its place as one of the most prominant slasher movies. It takes the slightly different approch of not showing who the killer is or what the killer is doing, thus creating more nervousness for the victum. Issues that I have include the slow pace of the film, Loomis being talk but little action and the fact that the theatrical cut does little to make us afraid of Michael. 4/5 critique. 3/5 personally

However the main reason this gets four stars is the fact that, this is the 2nd edition of this movie and it doesn't posess all of the extra's on previous releases. Half the reason people buy movies on blu ray is for more extra's, or getting previous extra's (along with the new ones) on a single release. This movie is one of those movies that you must have multiple releases to have every extra. Films like this are always annoying for extra's guys like me. Now if I had to recommend one of the two editions of this film on blu ray to get, I'd say get this one. The reason being, it's better to have the better cut with no extra's instead of a worse cut with extra's (unless you prefer the theatrical cut of Daredevil).

Ultimatly good movie but, bad job of releases.",1390867200,,1244,4.357758620689655

5838149,5,B00DOB3N56,"It's a running joke among fans that DVD company Anchor Bay will find a new way to release the movie HALLOWEEN every year. The thing is that even so those same fans will get in line for each new release. Each and every edition of the film to make its way to DVD has included something new in the extras that make it worth owning. This new release of the film is no different.

HALLOWEEN: THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION is the best way to watch this classic horror film and released just in time for the actual holiday. What movie matches the theme of the season any better than this one? Forget Freddy and Jason, when it comes to the holiday of Halloween Michael Myers is the name everyone remembers.

I've praised the film before and will continue to do so. For the very few that may not have seen this film at least once in the 35 years since it was released (I know, it's hard to believe it's actually been that long) it tells the story of Michael Myers who starts the film by killing his sister (no not a spoiler since it happens right away). Years later Michael has grown and due to the law must be examined to see if he can be released. Only the psychiatrist Dr. Loomis sees the evil that Michael actually is and warns them. But Michael escapes and heads back to his home town to kill again.

Side by side with this story is a group of girlfriends who are about to spend the night either with their boyfriends or babysitting. The main character is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and it is around her that most of the movie centers. Why Michael chooses these girls is never explained but later films in the series tried. What we witness then is the moments of terror everyone goes through, fear of the dark, of what we don't know, of the boogeyman coming to get you.

Director John Carpenter does an amazing job with this film, touching all the right nerves at the right moment and eliciting screams that would wake the dead. Cinematographer Dean Cundey make this low budget film look like it was made for millions using light and shadow to bring on the scares and direct or misdirect the viewers attention from start to finish. Cundey was responsible for the new blu-ray transfer of this film and it has never looked better. Items that might not have been seen in shadow before are highlighted now and the look of the film is stunning.

The extras this time around include several that have been around before including a 25 years later examination of the locations used in the film, but it's the new ones that will catch collector's attention. Included this time is a new commentary track by Carpenter and Curtis together talking about the film for the first time. Also included is a short film called ""The Night She Came Home"" about Curtis' appearance at the Horrorhound horror convention last year, the first convention appearance she's done since the film came out.

Fans will want to add this edition to their collection. If you don't have it in yours now is the time to add it. If not for the extras than for the near perfect remastering of the film itself. This is the way HALLOWEEN was meant to be seen.",1388448000,2,3116,4.448336252189142

Not too grainy though!. it has the footage shot for the  tv version on here , if not all of it , at least most of it. which was only available on a limited edition dvd set years ago.  The film itself proves that a horror movie that is great to even nonfans can be made on a low budget.  They shot a lot of this on location in Pasadena and I must agree that I like most on location filming better than studio soundstage. that's not always possible of course.  The acting was spot on here and it made Jamie lee Curtis a star. Of course we get the great Donald pleasance here too.  This is the version to get. It really does john carpenter and Deborah hill justice. both of them really had great careers after this film too. Although Deborah hill passed away recently , rip  we see her and others in a 2003 documentary., that's in this one.  time moves so fast.  ti's hard to imagine how big this movie was in 1978, it should give future filmmakers hope that they can do great things with a low budget.  because a bigger budget wouldn't have made a difference it was the crew and cast that made this great. and of course Mr Carpenter..  DO NOT GET any other version. if only they'd restored the other movies, None of them are restored and  some have plenty of specks on them. strangely , Halloween h20 from 1998 has the worst picture!. but this is the real classic. It can stand alone in it's greatness , most horror films have to be on their own rating system.  but this competes with big screen a budget flicks and stands up really well.  black Christmas (1974 version , the  newer one is slop)  really was the forefather of this one is some ways. but this is much better. and ut changed things a lot.",1388188800,,1862,4.247159090909091

See - Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis going bonkers trying to locate*the Shape* Michael Myers.
See - a reference to The Thing From Another World which Carpenter would do his own magnificent remake - 3 years later..
This truly is the way a slasher should be done. This paved the way for tons of slashers, a lot of them inferior but still worth watching.

The new Blu-ray transfer is outstanding and a new audio commentary with Jamie Lee Curtis and (Director) John Carpenter offers some new insights.  ""Halloween"" remains the Alpha and Omega of boogeyman movies and for good reason - it's just plain suspenseful and scary.  Carpenter worked on a limited budget and takes his time establishing the atmosphere.  But when Michael Myers begins stalking Laurie Strode (Curtis) the movie kicks into high gear.  I saw this film in the theater in 1978 and it scared the bejeezus out of me.  Today it remains my favorite horror film.  For fans, the great transfer, new packaging and commentary are worth the purchase price.  Happy Halloween - Everyone's Entitled To At Least One Good Scare...",1384300800,,790,5.023076923076923
5838165,1,B00DOB3N56,"I am here reviewing the product, not the movie itself, which is probably my second favourite film of all time, and one whose every single edition and every single format I've purchased. Having watched it on all of these releases, I can state without hesitation that the picture quality is the best I've ever seen for any format of this movie, including the Criterion laserdisc edition. The blues and oranges have been restored from the ""colour balanced"" 2007 Blu ray edition, as has the grain from the original celluloid, yet it is crystal clear. Not quite the revelation that was Alien on Blu ray (which looks like it was filmed last year, not three-and-a-half decades ago), but close. However, the sound makes this edition of Halloween unwatchable: the voice track can barely be heard, and new sound effects have been added which sit in the front of the mix. It's very disturbing to be watching a scene taking place inside a car and hearing lightning crashes that sound like they're in the car, too! Even the booklet casing it came in is a mixed bag, since its dimensions don't allow it to sit with the rest of your Blu rays without sticking out of the shelf, and the sleeve is one of those cardboard slots that eventually damage the disc if you slip it in and out enough times (and, yes, I dislike the cover art as much as almost everyone else here has mentioned). On a positive note, on the inside are 24 pages of production photos even I, a lifelong uberfan of the movie, hadn't seen before (plus the poster art that should have been used for the cover), but even that doesn't merit a purchase, as they can now be found online. Nor do the liner notes say anything new and compelling, mostly rambling on like a first-year film student essay, rehashing most of the facts and figures we, the fans, already know by heart, and sounding pretentious and glib. A huge disappointment, one which I heartily recommend skipping (I returned mine the day after receiving and watching it).",1384128000,5,1979,4.625
5838166,5,B00DOB3N56,"This HALLOWEEN 35th ANNIVERSARY EDITION is pretty cool and features several new items in the ""special features"" area. The picture has been remastered for Blu-Ray and approved by the original cinematographer, Dean Cundey, as well as adding a new Dolby True HD 7.1 audio for those with high end home theater sound systems.

I didn't see this in the movie theaters, so I'm not sure why there was some controversy about the first Blu-Ray release, which I also own, but in this release the picture is really stunning! I only noticed the tiniest bit of noise in some scenes that had a pitch black background, but otherwise the image quality is outstanding. The darks are really dark, without becoming a blackout, and you can make out details in the shadows, so it really makes the movie even eerier than before.

One thing that puzzles me is the scene where the Shape comes into the bedroom dressed as a ghost with Bob's (John Michael Graham) glasses on, and Lynda (Soles) is in the bed and she says, ""Like what you see?"" I could've sworn viewers could see her breasts and she lowers the sheet, but here you don't really see past the top part of her chest. Maybe my memory is fuzzy or it was one of those scenes where your mind fills in the blank (like the shower scene in Hitchcock's ""Psycho""). Anyway, it's not a big deal.

The only issue I had is with the special features. Missing in this 35th Anniversary Edition of Halloween is the nearly 90-minute featurette, ""Halloween: A Cut Above The Rest"" that was featured on the 2007 Blu-Ray release, so fans might want to hold onto that disc.

However, other special features have been added in its place:

SPECIAL FEATURES

*** The Night SHE Came Home!! *** 59:42 -minutes 11/2012
This featurette shows Jamie Leigh Curtis going from Los Angeles to Atlanta and then on to Indianapolis for the ""Horror Hound"" convention in a fundraising effort for Children's Hospital Los Angeles. You get to see her interact with fans of Halloween, take pictures with them, and sign a million autographs (you'll also see a grown up Tommy Doyle [Brian Andrews] come up and greet Curtis). This is one of the very few horror (if not the only) conventions that Curtis has appeared in for ""Halloween.""

*** On Location 25-Years Later *** 10:25 -minutes 1993(?)
Fun featurette that features writer/producer Debra Hill and actress P.J. Soles (Lynda) revisiting the real locations that were used in the film. All of the exterior shots were filmed in South Pasadena and West Hollywood, California, and  viewers get to see them. The featurette shows the scene from the movie, and then shows the actual location as it looked in '93 (or when this was shot).

*** TV Version Footage *** 10:46 -minutes (SPOILERS)
This shows clips that were used in place of certain scenes in the movie that were too racy for television. I'm not sure if it's shown exactly as cut and presented on TV or not -- I don't think I've ever seen the TV edited version -- because it's a little confusing the way it's presented here. It shows somewhat of the back-story of what takes place after the murder of his sister and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is having it out with the psychiatric board about the need to keep Michael Myers in a maximum security mental hospital, but they refuse. He then goes to visit the young Michael and tells him that he's not fooled by this act and then the scene brings us back to the present (back then). Myers is an adult and already in Haddonfield, and we get to see the inside of Laurie's (Curtis) house with a scene of Lynda (Soles) coming over and then they talk to Annie (Nancy Loomis) on the phone. This scene takes place after they get home from school and before Annie picks Laurie up in the car for baby sitting.

*** Trailers & TV/Radio Spots ***

The digibook also comes with liner notes about the movie and production with great behind the scenes photographs of the cast and crew.

This movie is a CLASSIC and it held up well through the years, in fact it's better than most horror movies coming out today, so I would recommend getting it. I'm not sure why this now only available from third party sellers (as of this writing 11/04/13) unless Amazon sold out because of Halloween.",1383523200,10,4214,4.6114819759679575

TV Version footage is added but not included for any extended cut viewing. Lots of new pictures in the essay and booklet section. But all together... I say that the original blu-ray edition is more of a fan-pleaser than this special edition would be.

5838177,1,B00DOB3N56,"5 stars for Halloween but 1 star for this 35th Anniversary Edition. Okay, we got that out of the way. What I want to talk about is the color timing concerns with current and previous releases. I'm a long time fan of Halloween. I was 7 years old when the film was in theaters and I've seen everything from the first television debut in 1981 to every VHS video tape, Laserdisc, DVD, and now the latest Blu-ray (BD) releases. As much as the 35th Anniversary BD Edition is considered to have the correct color timing, and as approved by Dean Cundy (again), this version has the most differences. This is the part that confuses me - to my knowledge, John Carpenter used spruce green coveralls for Michael Myers. This is the color I've been used to seeing in every version and edition of Halloween up to this point. The spruce green coveralls are mostly apparent in the scene when Tommy Doyle runs into Michael Myers in the school yard. The color has been obvious for years (it has been mentioned that Dick Warlock personally chose spruce green coveralls for Halloween II to match the first movie). After watching the new 35th Anniversary BD Edition, the coveralls are now navy blue. Dean Cundy completely removed the spruce green and basically remastered the film by turning down the contrast and color levels, and placed a blue/cool-temp filter over the natural colors. Does anyone else see this? Were all the previous versions, even the 1981 television broadcast, wrong? Have a look at this review and the screenshots by High-Def Digest at [...]. Their screenshot comparisons are compelling. There's certainly been some improvements but I don't believe that the 35th Anniversary BD is the definitive look. I'm not so convinced that the 2007 BD Edition is all that incorrect. You have a warm orange appearance of Fall, or a cool blue appearance of Fall. But when did Fall look blue? I'm not talking about the blue-lit night scenes, but Fall has always had a cast of oranges, yellows, and browns. This latest BD version doesn't look right to me.",1382227200,5,2040,4.749295774647887
5838178,4,B00DOB3N56,"I think I should start off by sayingm each edition of Halloween that has been released, I have purchased, Some of the releases over the years have been better than others. I however did not purchase the initial blu-ray release from 07/08.
To begin with here I can't say I'm too pleased with the cover art. Why couldn't just go with the classic jack-o-lantern,knife wielding image,
The image looks good, although not as striking color wise, but I guess that was the purpose of having Dean Cundey supervise the transfer. The sound track is synonymous to the chace 5.1 release on my dvd copy! It works for me! Having the option of listening to the original mono lossy sound is a good addition!
The extras are fair. I don't know how impressed other may be with seeing Jamie Lee signing movie memorabilia but I don't feel it's disappointing!

The picture and sound are fantastic and you can definitely tell that the quality of the original color and look were restored as much as it possibly could at this level of HD. For people that are saying otherwise, get your TV adjusted and calibrated correctly. I have a Sony HD LCD 52"" Flat Screen TV and when I first received it a few years back, I spent hours making sure that thing was fine tuned and adjusted correctly. When I put an the older Blu-ray copy of this film and compared it to this new version, the difference is there and obvious. The skin tones and the color of the trees/grass are all corrected here. The case is designed like a book with the disc safely tucked in on the back cover. This is a beautiful Blu-ray right down to the packaging. I recommend this release for anyone who has yet to purchase Halloween on Blu-ray and I will even go as far as saying, it is worth double dipping if you are a huge fan of the film.",1381449600,6,984,4.211640211640212
5838181,5,B00DOB3N56,"John Carpenter's seminal horror classic returns to haunt Blu-Ray once again, here in a newly remastered transfer supervised by cinematographer Dean Cundey expressly for this release.

Anchor Bay previously brought the Jamie Lee Curtis-Donald Pleasance slasher - which introduced Michael Myers to audiences around the world - to Blu-Ray in 2007. While that release was well-received by most at the time (myself included), fans objected to some of the color timing alterations in the image - elements that have been corrected in this new 1080p AVC encode, which also boasts finer detail and contrasts, especially during darker scenes. The result is a cooler image than its Blu-Ray predecessor, but one that's likely to please ""Halloween"" fans even more with its pristine presentation. On the audio side, the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD track is effectively layered with a good balance of dialogue and effects, while the original theatrical mono is also included for purists.

The Digibook release includes some fresh extras: in addition to a newly recorded commentary track with John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, the disc boasts an entertaining, hour-long featurette ""The Night She Came Home,"" following Curtis as she heads to a horror convention last year. Footage shot for NBC's TV version of the movie (filmed during the production of ""Halloween II"") is likewise included, while returning supplements include the 10-minute ""On Location: 25 Years Later"" featurette, the trailer and TV spots. The disc omits the older commentary (first recorded for Criterion's laserdisc) and the feature-length documentary on the film, but seeing as viewers have likely taken in these extras on countless other releases, their omission here doesn't detract from the package as a whole. Highly recommended!",1381363200,2,1780,5.399280575539568
5838182,5,B00DOB3N56,This is finally the best version of this film.  Now they have played with the colors and made this look weird and then screwed up some stuff by doing that.  So they went back to the drawing board with the original film guy and said how should the film look in HD.  The result is the quintessential version of the film that by far kicks the others in the pants.  Now if you have this on blu ray then don't bother with buying another version.  But being that I don't own the other versions I am glad to have this one.  The extras with Jamie Lee and visiting the house again are nice but have been done before to some extent.  The new commentary I haven't gotten to with John.  Which I know is a cardinal sin but I just haven't had a chance to go through it.  The packaging on this kind of sucks.  It is bigger and slimmer than a normal case and they have like a book glued into it and the back cover you actually can see the glue spots on it which is awful.  But if I live to see a 50th anniversary version who knows how that will look.  I mean I don't know how you get a film this old to look any better than this is.  Seriously.  This is the version you want.,1381363200,2,1159,3.961038961038961
5838183,5,B00DOB3N56,"Does this new edition look better than the previous Blu-ray of Halloween? Yes. A lot better? No. The original blu ray was pretty damn good and this one IS noticeably better to my eyes but not a ton. I love the film so I am glad I shelled out $19.95 for a slightly improved picture, but was still disappointed by the commentary, in which we get to hear ""how scary"" each scene is from a way-too-hip-for-me Jamie Lee Curtis, who as we all know is brilliant in this movie, but annoying as hell on the commentary. Can't tell you how many times she interrupts John Carpenter who can't get a word in edgewise. And she has almost nothing interesting to say. Carpenter may have had something fresh to say but thanks to JLC we'll never know. (And I normally love her too and sometimes appreciate her enthusiasm but its too much here.)

The only new extra feature is a 60-min doc watching JLC charm a large group of horror fans at a convention for charity. Put together by JLC's sister so she does come off as a saint.

Seems that since Anchor Bay was going through the trouble of rereleasing this they could have gone all out. It is as one reviewer said, a little underwhelming. Even the packaging is ho hum.....",1381276800,3,1202,4.40990990990991

5838185,4,B00DOB3N56,"I've owned a number of different releases of 'Halloween' since the mid 1990's--VHS cassette, DVD, the first Blu-Ray release, and now this 35th Anniversary Edition. The film is still the same classic shocker from 1978 that introduced us to Michael Myers, the six year old boy who murders his sister on October 31, 1963, and then escapes from a mental institution nearly fifteen years to the day of that killing, returning to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois with the intent of picking up where he left off. On his trail is Dr. Sam Loomis (the iconic Donald Pleasance), who spent eight years trying to rehabilitate Myers, then seven trying to keep him locked up after coming to the realization that Myers was a soulless, unresponsive monster. Aided by one of the most memorable theme scores in the history of horror cinema (by the film's director, John Carpenter), 'Halloween' essentially ushered in the ""slasher movie"" genre that was imitated to no end throughout the 1980's. The audio upgrade to 7.1 Dolby is welcome, though for the true enthusiast, the original mono sound is available.

While the film itself still receives the highest grade, it's the extras in this latest version that I found to be a significant disappointment. When I learned that the bonus footage filmed for the NBC airing of 'Halloween' in 1980 was going to be included in this package, I had expected that both the original film and the film with the additional scenes would be available. Unfortunately, the additional film work is left seperate, as only part of the bonus features. Also, there is a documentary with Jamie Lee Curtis attending a  horror convention, raising money for Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. I didn't really find it that interesting, aside from a quick gathering of the actors who have played ""The Shape"" through the franchise's long run of sequels. The trailers, TV ads, and radio spots that have been available on past releases are included here as well. I was expecting considerably more, for such a significant milestone in the film's history.",1381190400,2,2056,4.956521739130435
5838186,5,B00DOB3N56,"I think the look and sound of this edition is superb. I don't think I've seen it look better. And of course the film itself is one of the most justly celebrated horror films ever made. It's all the more impressive considering the low budget and how little actual violence is seen. The direction of the film by Carpenter is terrific but just as important is the iconic score. We are given long shots of scenes where very little happens on the screen but with the music, it becomes scary. I can appreciate that even more with all the movies made now with the infamous 'shaky' cam.

But the extras? Not so great. The documentary about Jamie Lee Curtis going to a convention is not bad but I can't say it interested me. The more interesting short feature is revisiting the sites where the film was made. A more thorough 'making of' documentary with the cast would be much more interesting. The new commentary with Carpenter and Curtis is at least energetic, although I doubt any new ground is covered. But how much more can we learn about this film. It's been analyzed over and over. But I always like these kinds of commentaries because it feels like we are invited to watch it with them if that makes any sense.

If you don't have this film and want it for the film itself, I would recommend it. It's the main reason I bought it. I didn't own it.

But if you want lots of extras and/or already have a copy you like, I doubt this would appeal to you.

And the packaging is terrible. It's a nice booklet but you have to slide the disc in and out. I decided to just use an empty CD jewel case for it.",1381190400,2,1595,4.289036544850498

I was wrong.  The transfer is disappointing to say the least.  Black levels are terrible.  Colors are better overall than the previous version in that they aren't as saturated as in the previous version, but the trade off with the poor black levels makes it a wash (pun intended).

As to the extras, the new commentary consists mostly of Jamie Lee Curtis shouting the praise of John Carpenter and him scoffing at her enthusiasm.  It's got very little in the way of insight into the film and is genuinely disappointing.

The packaging is particularly bad.  The ""book"" has some cool pics but the disc is stored in a glued-in paper sleeve in the back.  It's cheap and can potentially damage the disc.

5838190,5,B00DOB3N56,"I once had a professor in an international horror class who gave an entire lecture arguing the merits of VHS tapes over DVD or high definition quality playback. I'm sure this was largely in part of his age; having experienced each of these modern classics through grainy film images, this was what he felt nostalgia for. In some respects, I could understand where he was coming from. We are spoiled these days, consumers of cutting edge technology which puts even more pressure on modern filmmakers. Seeing older films in pristine condition is a wholly new concept for cinephiles.

Before VHS there were few options for seeing an older film, regardless of quality. The best chances were theaters which had an old print to play, often scratched and worn from many trips through various projectors across the country. Every time I viewed Halloween prior to this 35th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release, it was difficult to see what was happening in some of the darker sequences of the film. Say what you will about the nostalgia of scratched and blurry film, but this version of Halloween allows us to see the immaculate photography by Dean Cundey and each of Michael's background appearances in the first hour of the film.

From that astonishingly long and uninterrupted first shot that puts the audience in the point-of-view of Michael Myers, John Carpenter changed the face of horror movies for decades to come. Credit is often given to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho for being the first slasher film, but it is Michael Powell's Peeping Tom which shares much more of the credit, especially this opening shot of Halloween. There is a sequence in Peeping Tom in which the killer uses the sharp edge of a camera tripod to kill a victim, as the camera is still rolling. The implication is that the camera itself is a killer, implicating all viewers as accomplices to the enjoyment of the murder. This would continue into the 1980s, becoming a staple of the slasher genre along with the gruesome deaths of the least moral characters and survival of a single pure heroine.

Jamie Lee Curtis was the first ""final girl"" in her debut role as Laurie, the babysitter who survived the attacks of the boogeyman, Michael Myers. Curtis and Carpenter came together to record an all-new commentary track for this release, which also includes an all-new remastered HD transfer of the film. It was supervised by Cundey, and also has a new Dolby TrueHD 7.1 audio track, which definitely puts the various speakers in your system to work in order to give an immersive viewing experience.

Additional special features include a new featurette with more nostalgia from Curtis about this career-defining role, and an older featurette from ten years ago with a look at the original set locations. Also included is the TV version footage, trailers, TV and radio spots, and a collector's book packaging. The case opens as a book with production photos and information, and the disc tucked away on the back page. The cover art is fantastic, simple and elegant as we can now see this film to be in all its clear HD glory. My former professor can take the VHS copy; I would much rather have this 35th Anniversary Blu-ray.

The new features included for this release was the rare 2012 Halloween convention appearance by Jamie Lee Curtis entitled, the night she came home. I know I didn't capitalize any of that and there is a reason, it's not that good. I understand Jamie Lee is a big star and can be selective in her time and appearances, but the constant reminder that this is, 'a one of a kind event' got very old and unnerving after awhile. Yes, she was gracious enough to give those whom paid the price to attend something to forever remember, but the constant ego reminder of who and what she was is not worth the watch. Sorry, that's just me.
The other new feature is a newly recorded commentary by John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis - what a disaster! One of the worst commentaries I have ever endured next to John Milius and Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2000 commentary for Conan the Barbarian. The biggest problem is Jamie Lee's reaction. It's like she's never seen a horror film before. Carpenter couldn't get a word in edge-wise and the whole experience of listening to mostly Jamie Lee's overbearing comments/reaction left me drained by the end of the film. Not very good at all! Skip it and enjoy the perfect picture and audio that we have waited for for so long in a Blu-ray release. This is the sole reason for buying the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray edition.",1380844800,2,1599,4.552083333333333
5838193,5,B00DOB3N56,"This review is for the 35th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray

Released by Anchor Bay Entertainment/Starz this Blu-ray version looks just absolutely stunning in HD. The colors are a lot more crisp & fresh, and overall has much brighter images than other versions i've seen, even the DVD counterparts. There is a very slight graininess, but you'd have to really be looking for it to even notice it's there, and is not nearly as bad as some HD transfers i've seen. this version also features newly remastered 7.1 surround sound which they also did an excellent job balancing the soundtrack audio with the dialogue audio so you don't have to keep adjusting the volume back and forth just to hear what people are saying, and because the action sequences are too loud, which was always a major problem with the DVD releases. overall this version is well worth the money if you're considering purchasing it. here is a list of the disc specs

5838194,4,B00DOB3N56,"There is one crucial detail in this Blu-ray release that will probably leave many fans bored out of their minds, yet its one of the things they have always wanted most. The commentary track of Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter. Thats right, the brand spanking new commentary track. These two ramble on about stuff the average fan already knows, and a few new things we have never heard before which is only a few things. That is the only thing good about this track. You would think they would have interesting conversation though right? WRONG! Jamie pretty much spells out the movie scene for scene and is almost as if she is high on drugs with how many times she says ""Wow..., Beautiful..."" etc. She pretty much is commentating as if its her first time ever watching the film since she made it. Its funny though because John interrupts her several times and says, ""Thats right!"" Almost as if the poor guy just wants to do his commentary for the fans (finally after all these years), but Jamie pretty much ruins the whole thing. Its almost as if they should have both written notes on what to talk about before doing the track, or at least watch the film once all the way through so they can jog their memories before recording the commentary. Its a shame because many fans, myself included, have waited for a long time to hear a new, (uncut) commentary track. Especially from these two. Yet all you get is pointless blabber from Jamie nearly 90% of the commentary and John only puts in his two cents every once in a while.

OTHER than that, its perfect. The picture quality is way better than before, and the new little documentary, ""The Night She Came Home"" is AWESOME! I even saw my friend who went to the event in there!

This would have received 5 stars if it weren't for that terrible commentary track that we all waited years for.",1380672000,2,1840,4.505988023952096
5838195,5,B00DOB3N56,"I am almost certain that I have purchased this classic film every single time it has been re-released, which has been quite numerous. The Blu-ray version released prior to this one was cool, but it really had very little that was new in the way of extras. Furthermore, its visual appearance and audio transfer was just okay. The 35th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of HALLOWEEN, however, is fan worthy (at least as far as I am concerned). There are lots of new extras and the look and sound of the film are extraordinary.",1380672000,,518,4.641304347826087
5838196,5,B00DOB3N56,"I will split this review into two parts - The Movie and The Blu Ray.

Part One - The Movie. Not many people will argue that John Carpenter's seminal horror classic ""Halloween"" would not rank as one of the top suspense/horror films of all time. In fact, it may actually be the most influential horror film of all time (even surpassing Alfred Hitchcock's timeless classic ""Psycho"" in this regard). Like 'Psycho', 'Halloween' affected the moviegoers long after initially seeing it in the theaters. It wasn't long after that imitators such as 'Friday the 13th', 'My Bloody Valentine', 'The Funhouse', and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (among many, many others) used the 'Halloween' formula of a psychotic killer after helpless, unsuspecting teenagers to great effect. It has been 35 years since it's initital release, and yet 'Halloween' still maintains a lofty perch on the horror landscape and is still a beloved holiday classic (despite being terribly re-made by Rob Zombie, who has no business touching a classic like this), culminating in annual holiday theater re-runs as well as finding a special place as the final film showed (on Halloween night) on AMC's yearly 13+ day 'Fear Fest' horror film marathon. It's hard to list many movies that have held their grips on the minds and hearts of moviegoers over years and decades like 'Halloween' has.

The plot is so well known that I won't even attempt to go into it. I will instead describe my first encounter with this film. Originally I had seen the sequel 'Halloween II' first. So, I was already familiar with Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, but there were obviously details that were omitted from the second film because the filmmakers assumed that the viewer had already seen the original. Fast forward to Halloween night, 1992 - a saturday. After a night of trick-or-treating I retreated to my bedroom with my generous Halloween haul to enjoy some candy and some TV on my ""huge"" 19 inch RCA color tv (having retired my 13 in. black and white Zenith the prior year). I orignially planned a night of NES, but didn't want to have to stop every minute or so to open another piece of candy, so I tuned in WDRB-41 (the Louisville area Fox affiliate) instead, and just before 10:00 p.m. saw that 'Halloween' was due to air. I had never seen it and decided to go ahead and watch (I recorded it on VHS as well). I loved it and immediately after popped in my old VHS recording of 'Halloween II' from an old tv airing on WGN 9 and watched that all the way through, mainly so I could see how the pieces fit together. My first impressions of the original film were that I thought it was one of the coolest horror movies I had ever seen. I couldn't wait to watch it again on my recorded VHS, and did so the next morning. The viewing had such an effect on me that I remember it so vividly now, more than 20 years later. In the simplest of terms, 'Halloween' is a masterpiece of psychological horror. Carpenter drew on inspiration from not only Afred Hitchcock, but directors such as Howard Hawkes (who he pays homage to in the film with Laurie and Tommy watching Hawkes film ""The Thing From Another World"") and even elements from Stanley Kubrick as well. It is an amazing movie and there's no wonder why it is universally praised as being one of the top 100 films of all-time.

Part Two - The Blu Ray. Although I expected the picture to be far better (after being spoiled by the amazing restoration jobs done on Spielberg films ""Jaws"", ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the film does look better than it ever has, with deep blacks and rich vibrant colors (particularly in things like pumpkins and grass/trees, etc.). I did, however, expect a bit more from the Dean Cundey helmed HD transfer and was a bit disappointed, but not much. The film still looks amazing and maintains just the right level of film grain. The sound mix is great and really enhances the mood of the picture. The coolest thing about the Blu Ray release, however, is the Carpenter/Curtis commentary track which I will update this review with my thoughts on once I listen to it this weekend. I've been waiting for this for years, since listening to the Carpenter/Russell commentaries on ""The Thing"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China"".

Overall, this is a great Blu Ray release of one of the greatest films of all-time.",1380585600,9,4355,4.666666666666667
5838197,2,B00DOB3N56,"I never thought I'd write even the slightest negative comment on a film I've loved for years; however, this release broke the camel's back. The packaging is just awful. To begin with, it is an oversized, superfluous book with just terrible artwork. Second, the Blu-Ray disc is housed in a tight envelope instead of a snap-in cradle: you have to grab the disc by the edges and pull it out--effectively smearing the edges and scratching it everytime you take it out or put it back in. You would think with all the wasted space from the oversized packaging, they would have found ample space for proper disc storage.

Finally, where does it end? How many 'new' featurettes(or re-shuffling of old ones), or 'remastering' jobs are they going to fling our way in order to tantalize us and justify us rebuying basically the same thing over and over and over again? I mean, really: one of the things Halloween has been rightfully praised for is its cinematography. Shy of the awful prints used for the first, early-80s Media Home Video videotape release, most home video editions have been excellent to breathtaking (the Criterion Laserdisc edition from, I believe, the late 90s is particularly scrumptious) and the previous Blu-Ray release is, itself, quite lovely. Obviously, the lack in clarity of the cinemetography on past home video editions has not been an issue or impediment to this film being recognized as the genius piece of filmmaking that it is. Is there going to be a 40th, 45th, Deluxe 50th, 55th, etc...? Anchor Bay and/or the Yablans and the Akkads should archive this title and show it a little more dignity and restraint. The movie will stand on its own, despite the gimmickry of a new edition every five years.

One last thing: am I mistaken or does that awful Jamie Lee Curtis extra featurette not make her seem like a self-absorbed, condescending twit?! I mean, I appreciate that she was doing it/some of it for charity, but she comes off at times as disingenuous and condescending to horror film fans. One example: when she takes photographs with fans she strategically hugs them: not because she's being warm and gracious, it seems, but because, she says, she doesn't want to get their body moisture on her!!! I met Ms. Curtis once outside of a Foley studio on the corner of La Brea and Hollywood Blvd. in Hollywood and she was gracious, unaffected and engaging--even taking time to engage in conversation; therefore, I was baffled by the tone of the featurette. I mean, I get it, she encounters alot of 'unique' people; but, why would you allow that to be on a release that's intended for just that audience? That featurette should not have been on this already mediocre release. Or at least, it should have been edited by about 35-40 minutes. At times it felt like I was watching Madonna's ""Truth or Dare"".",1380499200,6,2825,4.775051124744376
5838198,5,B00DOB3N56,"Unless you have been living in a cave for the past three decades, there's a pretty good chance you've heard of the HALLOWEEN franchise.  If you have not, then see below for the plot synopsis.  This series of films is regarded as one of the most iconic of the horror genre.  And for good reason:  the first film, featured in this review, is what launched the entire slasher-flick genre.  The fine folks over at Anchor Bay recognize the importance of this film and have therefore issued a special 35th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray in its honor.

I have to preface this review by stating that John Carpenter is my favorite director of all-time.  That's a bold statement to make, but his films helped define who I am as an adult, and many of them are on my Favorite Movies of All-Time list.  These include HALLOWEEN, THE FOG, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, and GHOSTS OF MARS.  I left out THE THING because it is actually in my Top 5 Favorite Movies of All-Time.

HALLOWEEN is not only ground-breaking, it's scary as hell.  I am ashamed to admit that I just saw it for the first time about three years ago, but even then it scared me.  This is the `patient zero' of slasher flicks, and you can see how every one after it has copied it in some form or fashion.

The 35th ANNIVERSARY EDITION Blu-ray presents an all-new HD transfer that was personally supervised by the film's original cinematographer, Dean Cundey, and a new 7.1 audio mix.  The difference between this version and the one I saw three years ago on DVD is enormous; the HD Blu-ray experience is so much more vivid and engrossing, which allows for a deeper immersion into the film itself.

This edition also includes new, never-before-seen Special Features that include a commentary track by John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, a featurette called ""The Night She Came Home"" with Jamie Lee Curtis, original trailers for the film, and more.

If you've seen HALLOWEEN before, then you must see it again with this new HD transfer; if you're watching it for the first time, you will absolutely lose yourself in this amazing Blu-ray.  Regardless, this 35th ANNIVERSARY EDITION is a must own for any movie collector.  It is available now, so pick your copy up today.",1380326400,4,2263,4.629072681704261
5838199,1,B00DOB3N56,"There is no difference that I saw between this version and the original Blu-Ray released Halloween.  I originally purchased this item due to the TV scenes added into the film which unfortunetaly is incorrect in the product description.  The TV version scenes are only in the Special Features as like they are deleted scenes.  If you don't have this one then I'd say purchase it, but if you have the original all you truely get here is the new featureet and the TV scenes are in their own Special Features location (originally in featurette of last release).  Not very happy with the way this was advertised.",1380240000,,607,4.69811320754717
5838200,4,B00DOB3N56,"It doesn't matter what time of year it is, any time you watch ""Halloween"" it becomes October 31st for an hour and a half. Anchor Bay Entertainment reminded me of this with its 35th Anniversary Edition of John Carpenter's slasher masterpiece. It's always a pleasure to re-visit Haddonfield and spend a little more time with Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and all her friends.

Does ""Halloween"" really need any introduction? It might not be the first slasher film in horror history, but it's certainly the one that jump-started the genre and is still being imitated today. After the image of Michael Myers' famous white William Shatner mask hit screens, things were never the same. Suddenly, every psychotic in these types of films was covering their face using gimmicky guises. We've seen every sort of mask cover the maniac's identity, including hockey, gas, jester, cherub, and firefighter.

""Halloween"" captures the time period and small-town feel of its setting so perfectly. Anyone who lived through the late 1970s and trick-or-treated as a child in a suburb can attest to this. If you happened to grow up in Illinois like I did, the movie hits home even more. Honestly, Director Carpenter couldn't have done a better job establishing a believable atmosphere for this suspenseful and thrilling masterpiece.

An all-new HD transfer was supervised and approved by cinematographer Dean Cundey for the ""Halloween"" 35th Anniversary Edition. The picture is crystal clear without losing its ""real film"" flair. John Carpenter's eerie score and Michael Myers' heavy breathing is even more frightening and unnerving in Dolby TruHD 7.1 surround.

Fans of ""Halloween"" will be ecstatic when they see the special features found on this 35th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition. New audio commentary is included with Writer/Director John Carpenter and actor Jamie Lee Curtis. The new featurette ""The Night She Came Home"" follows Jamie Lee Curtis around as she makes a special appearance at a horror convention. It also contains the featurette ""On Location: 25 Years Later."" TV version footage, a trailer, and TV and radio spots round out the bonus material.

""Halloween"" 35th Anniversary Edition is a great looking item that any fan of the franchise will prize. It comes in a hardcover book packaging which features 20 pages of behind-the-scenes photos and commentary about the making of the film and its legacy. The Blu-ray is housed in a cardboard sleeve attached to the inside of the back cover. It's oversized in comparison to a regular Blu-ray case, so some might find it a pain for regular storage.",1380153600,3,2596,5.14218009478673
5838201,1,B00DOB3N56,"I find it funny that the selling point for this umpteenth release of Halloween is that Dean Cundey, the film's DP, has supervised and approved its transfer. Are you not aware that Cundey ""approved"" the transfer of the original standard DVD release of the film? Now I ask you, and Anchor Bay, why is the color timing on that DVD not correct, as so called ""film experts"" like to say, if Cundey did indeed give that transfer his approval? And now, 15 years later(Oh the irony),Cundey says that this new transfer is how the film should look. I'm guessing that in 5 or 10 years there will be another Blu Ray release of this film, with a  new transfer supervised and approved by Dean Cundey. And you know what, it will probably look like the old standard DVD I bought over a decade ago. But who am I to complain, I'll probably end up buying this anyway... :(",1380067200,4,852,4.3924050632911396

5838203,1,B00DOB3N56,"When I first heard about this release, I was excited that the film would finally get the treatment it deserved on blu-ray. Finally, the proper color timing would be applied and we could watch the film as it would have been seen back in 1978. Well, guess what folks, Anchor Bay is NEVER going to let that happen. Despite the fact that the original mono mix has been applied to every home video release up until now, Anchor Bay has decided not to give it to us this go round, instead choosing to give us a bad downmix of the 7.1 track and claim that it's the original mono. The dialog is hardly audible, the music sounds warped, and all the terrible new sound effects are in full effect. The 7.1 track is really your only option if you want to enjoy the film, but even then you have to deal with all the new sound effects that take you right out of the picture if you're used to the much superior mono mix. It's false advertising on Anchor Bay's part to say that the original mono is included on this release. They also didn't bother to port over all the extras, as usual, so we don't get the essential Cut Above the Rest doc, but a Jamie Lee Curtis vanity piece instead. Anchor Bay is by far the worst studio for blu-ray releases these days, which is ironic considering how great they were in the dvd era. It's another case of The Terminator, perfect picture quality with no option to listen to the superior original audio. The 2007 blu-ray remains definitive. This disc is a coaster. Even the cover art sucks.",1380067200,10,1509,4.3546099290780145
5838204,5,B00DOB3N56,"Anchor Bay has re-released John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece ""Halloween"" about as many times as they have the Evil Dead trilogy. It's been almost impossible to know which one to pick up over the years there are so many versions. Halloween was originally released on DVD by Anchor Bay featuring a bad transfer that didn't do the film any justice at all. They then re-released it again on DVD with a transfer approved by the original director of photography Dean Cundey. The transfer was greatly improved but it was lacking in extras for a film of such great importance. Then they released another cut of the film in which the extra scenes filmed for the TV airings of the film (filmed during the making of the sequel oddly enough) were cut into the film. A 4th DVD release then occured as part of their ""divimax"" line which was a 2 disc set with plentiful extras and a brand new remastered transfer.

That 4th DVD release proved to be the most problematic. While the quality of detail was greatly improved, somebody made a huge error in that they completely stripped away the blue tint from the film that made it appear that it was set in the fall. It just didn't look how Halloween was meant to look. A backlash ensued and Anchor Bay claimed to have taken those complaints into consideration with Halloween's blu-ray debut.

While the initial blu-ray release did correct some of the color timing errors of the divimax DVD release, it still just didn't look right and it was obvious that they didn't film the movie actually in the fall as the grass was too green and the night time scenes lacked that famous blue tint that gave the film such a great atmosphere.

Anchor Bay though have FINALLY righted their previous wrongs and brought director of photography Dean Cundey on board again to supervise the transfer for the film's 35th (has it really been that long?!) anniversary blu-ray re-release. After directly comparing the new blu-ray to the old blu-ray, I can say that they have FINALLY gotten it right and Halloween looks as it was meant to be seen again.

The colors in the new transfer are a bit more muted and natural looking than the first HD go around. The blue textures in the night scenes are back in full force and the film looks like it is set in the fall season once again! Not only that, but detail has taken a considerable boost with the new HD transfer compared to the first one. This is apparently due to the higher bit rate on the new release in addition to I believe they actually did a 4K scan this time of the original camera negative. It's truly like seeing the film again for the first time. No digital noise reduction was used so the film retains its filmlike grain texture. A truly amazing HD transfer of one of the greatest films ever made.

The sound is provided in a new 7.1 surround mix but the original mono mix is also included. Both are in lossless HD audio. Extras include a brand new commentary track featuring star Jamie Lee Curtis and director/co-writer/composer John Carpenter. Sadly though, the commentary tracks on the prior releases are missing in action. Most extras were ported over but not all from prior releases as well. This is a bit frustrating and keeps this from being as definitive of a release as it could have been. What is here though is nice and the best is a nearly one hour documentary of Jamie Lee Curtis doing her one and only horror convention to help raise money for a children's hospital charity that she supports.

The initial pressing of the new blu-ray also is included in a nice & classy digi-book featuring essays and lots of cool production photos. Apparently once this initial run is depleted, it will only be available in a standard blu-ray case so get the digi-pack while you can.

So, I highly recommend this new blu-ray to fans of the film as they finally got the film looking like it was supposed to look again and the new HD transfer is truly a marvel to the eyes. Why they chose not to include all previous extras too on this release is a bit frustrating but shouldn't keep somebody from not getting this new release. It blows the original bu-ray away picture quality wise and comes highly recommended!",1379980800,94,4179,4.578877005347594

5838209,5,B00DOB3N56,"Whenever I visit a movie blog and someone asks what the scariest movies ever made are, I never fail to list this one. Because, even though it was clearly shot on a shoestring budget and shows virtually no real gore, you get the idea and Carpenter wisely gave his audience credit for having the imagination to ""see"" what he doesn't show. This makes the psychological scare that results far more potent than today's gore-epics that show you every ounce of gore and gruesomeness their special effects and make-up people can create, because the movies released today leave absolutely NOTHING to the viewer's imagination because they throw it all at you with both hands. The result of this approach, in my opinion, is more disgust and revulsion than actual fear. ""Halloween"", and in many ways its sequel ""Halloween 2"", which picks up virtually where the first film ends and even starts by showing the closing scenes and I'm guessing was filmed in tandem with the first film, lets YOU the audience imagine in your mind what's happening ""behind the scenes"". Plus, the film's writing builds fear upon fear as the plot progresses, which is a cool approach because though you can guess what's going to happen next, it's the ANTICIPATION that's frightening, in much the same way 1960's ""The Haunting"", brilliantly crafted by Robert Wise, creates fear in the audience while showing you virtually nothing (unlike the dreadful recent re-make, which failed for all the reasons noted above), and along the same lines as Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", at the time shocking not only for both killing off a huge star less than 30 minutes in, but also for never really showing the infamous knife actually penetrating flesh in the shower scene. Some of the scariest movies I've ever seen scared me because they left a lot to my imagination and knew how to build psychological fear, which is the way Carpenter handles ""Halloween"". I remember seeing this film in the theatre when it was originally released and recall how the audience gasped and screamed in unison at scenes where absolutely no gore was shown...because Carpenter built the fear up in the screeenplay and not in the make-up department. Instead of going for cheap gimmicks, Carpenter relied on his audience's imagination to provide the fright, and it works beautifully. This is a great flick for a sleep-over horror movie marathon, and one I always recommend for people seeking suggestions on movie blogs, right along with the fabulously chilling 1951 Don Siegel masterpiece ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", which caused me to skip going to sleep for several nights in a row after viewing when I was a kid. So get this blu-ray or DVD if you're tired of being repulsed by all the cooked-up gore today's movies offer and just want to be frightened...it'll work beautifully!",1375488000,34,2805,4.932346723044398

i have to type it all in one review even thou both formats have different ASIN numbers
very pathetic and ridiculous

One of my favourite John carpenter films ever, Halloween
a Great Atmospheric chiller lots of suspense and some Horror, this film is more a suspense Thriller than a Horror
if it was a Horror there would be some Blood and Gore in the killing scenes
any Halloween fan knows the plot, this is about the different releases

there's been more than one DVD release of this film and this new 35th Anniversary blu-ray
which is the best version any Halloween fan will get of this film
and main reason is
cause this new HD transfer is done by Cinematographer Dean Cundey who was the actual D.O.P on the film
instead of someone else coming in to do a HD transfer
i've seen the film many times ofcourse so i just watched most of the film just to check the picture and audio quality
and i'm very amazed on How Good the picture and audio quality is, 10/10 HD quality
plus the Audio has been remixed in 7.1 surround sound now, previous releases only had 5.1 surround sound
so the Audio mix is excellent no Doubt about it

there's all new special features as well
Brand new Audio commentary by John carpenter and Jaime lee curtis which is nothing new
some new info about the film are mentioned that weren't said in the 25th Anniversary commentary but they are both similar

a new 1 hour Behind the scenes Documentary of Jaime Lee curtis attending the 35th Anniversary conventions
it's footage of her signing Posters, Having Photos with her Halloween fans and also Q&A footage aswell
i've seen the uncut Q&A footage with Jaime lee on you tube someone from the Audience filmed the whole Q&A goes for 1 hour
very interesting/exciting for sure
but there's also interviews with some of the fans aswell which is interesting
On Location 25 years later featurette which is nothing new cause this was on the 25th Anniversary edition anyway

there's TV version footage included from the Extended TV cut DVD release, 12 mins of extra footage
the footage is TV scenes actually that have been given a HD transfer for sure, the picture quality is incredible
the TV footage was filmed by John carpenter during the filming of Halloween II in 1980
cause when both Halloween and Halloween II were first broadcast on TV on the same night
John carpenter was asked to film some extra footage for NBC
some of the TV footage is worth watching and some of it isn't necessary and boring.
there's also TV footage of Halloween II for the NBC broadcast night,
the TV footage of Halloween II is just the Deleted scenes from the Theatrical version that's all
some of those scenes are boring aswell but each to their own

Anchor bay should've released the TV version on this blu-ray aswell for the fans
but instead they just added the TV scenes only
til this day the Extended cut version 104mins runtime has not been re-issued again on DVD or blu-ray since 2001
there's no extras at all on it just the Theatrical version with the TV footage added in that's it

it's still available to buy off amazon but very expensive depending which seller you buy from

the only Documentary that is not on this 35th Anniversary blu-ray is the Cut above the rest
that was actually released on the 25th Anniversary edition DVD
Cut above the rest is an extremely detailed Documentary 90mins about the making of Halloween and Halloween II
incredible Documentary but it's not on this 35th Anniversary blu-ray unfortunately for some reason

this blu-ray is a Digibook with some nice rare Photos in the book and some new notes on the film
so this 35th Anniversary blu-ray is definitely worth the money and is the best version to get.
i Gave it 5 star rating
but keep the 25th Anniversary edition dvd for the Cut above the rest Documentary.",1375228800,3,3873,4.593342981186686

8595330,2,B00DOB3N56,"This Blu-Ray was approved by the original cinematographer, Dean Cundey. The picture looks nice but the problem comes with the color. From the start of the movie to night fall when the girls arrive at their baby sitting homes the movie has a too much grayish/black tone to it. The Monte Carlo car instead of red now looks maroon. The Shape's garage suit instead of a navy blue looks dark gray. When the girls are leaving school it's not a sunny day but cloudy day like. Now once the shape appears at the homes outside the color comes back and the movie looks normal like we are used to seeing it. Now that famous scene when Laurie just sees her friends dead and the shape appears. In past tv, VHS, laserdisc, and dvd it always was a  moonlight that gave it a bluish tint which looked beautiful. On this blu-ray it's been darkened and grayed which looks more scary but takes away what you are used to for 35 years. Overall I didn't like what was done. I would not recommend true fans buy this.",1518566400,,991,4.356756756756757

8595334,3,B00DOB3N56,"This review is for the VIDEO and AUDIO quality and NOT the movie!

First, I've owned the original 2007 Blu-Ray, which I still believe is the best video quality of the BluRay releases.  I also own this 35th edition.  In 2007, when the original came out, I couldn't get over how great the picture looked: No grain, superb clarity, and great sound.  Then, I read High-Def Digest's review, and they slammed the picture saying that the color timing was off.  For example, Illinois in fall should look more orange and autumny whereas ""Halloween,"" was filmed in the spring in Pasadena, and it does show more green.  Also, the ""blue"" tint in a lot of the night scenes was gone.

So, 2007 was the 29th anniversary.  Flash forward 6 years to 2013 for the 35th anniversary.  This version had a video production overseen by Dean Cundey, who was the original cinematographer.  This was supposed to be a grand redo of the film, but turns out, it isn't.  This 35th edition has a lot of grain to it, especially in some night scenes.  Some of the day scenes have been severely sharpened to where the leaves/bushes in some of the scenes have a white border around them.  The sound on this blu-ray is not good.  It's a 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Master, but I noticed some seriously low volume on it, and nowhere near the immersion it should have.  While Blu-Ray promises the best in picture and sound, I have always thought the sound on the 25th Anniversary DVD was the best.

So, I compared this Blu-Ray to the Amazon Instant Video version I bought.  Here is what I found:
A) The Halloween version on Amazon Instant Video appears to be the master from the 2007 Blu-Ray release.  It's in 1080p HD, and the contrast allows for more of the orangey/fall feeling although there is still considerable ""green""
B) The AIV (Amazon Instant Video) version is not overly processed to have extreme sharpness
C) The sound on the AIV is much better.  It's coming through as Dolby Digital Plus which I found to be better.  For example:  The station wagon scene where Dr. Loomis and the nurse are on their way to pick up Michael.  It's storming outside.  The 35th Blu-Ray 7.1 sound track was low in volume, and had ""placement"" of the thunderstorm localized to a few speakers whereas the Dolby Digital Plus soundtrack was louder and more immersive.  Thunderstorms should not be ""placed"" in one speaker when you're in the middle of one.  The thunderstorm should be coming from all speakers to make you feel like you're IN the storm.  NOTE:  High-Def Digest said that the 7.1 mix on the 35th is not any kind of improvement over previous versions, and not only do I agree with this, I think the audio has been degraded.  I tend to think the AIV soundtrack is the same soundtrack found on the 25th Anniversary DVD, and this is a great thing!
D) The AIV version does not have the cool blue in the night scene.  The cool blue is noticeable in the scene where you see Michael Myers carrying Annie back into the Wallace's house directly after he kills her in the garage.  Also, you can see it in a) the scene where Linda and her boyfriend come pulling up in the van, and b) the scene where Laurie is walking over to the Wallace's from the Doyle's when she decides to check on what is going on.

While I realize there are some variations in color timing/etc, part of me wonders if it is related to the medium in which the master/transfer is on.  For example, does this ""orange"" that High-Def Digest want so badly come from being on a VHS tape as opposed to a Blu-Ray disc?  Perhaps the ""ideal"" (for me) transfer would be:
A) A complete new scan of original negatives to 8K; clean up everything on print; save to 4K
B) Redo the soundtrack to either Dolby Atmos or perhaps a nice Dolby Digital DTS 6.1 soundtrack that is more immersive.  Since the film is from 1978 and produced on low-budget, chances are the elements aren't there to have true DolbyHD considering the 35th has it and it isn't good.
C) If possible, do the color correct timing to make it look like it is October 31st as opposed to March 31st
D) No grain.  I don't understand why ""cinema purists"" feel that a layer of grain makes it more authentic.  No, it doesn't.  It's simply noise on top of what should be a great video presentation.  If you want grain, watch a ""found footage"" piece of crap shot at night on a low-budget camera.

8595335,5,B00DOB3N56,"Halloween is an amazing and untoppable horror film. Yes there is competition but in terms of the whole package in a horror film its pretty much the Granddaddy of them all. The entire film is absolutely terrifying and unsettling from the moment it starts. John Carpenter is the master of horror films and knows exactly what to do with it. Halloween is a movie that is a challenge and a dare to watch in an empty house in the middle of the night in complete dark. Suspense, unease, atmosphere, mood, characters you care about and psychology. This is how horror films should be made and James Wan knows this which is why he is the best horror director since Carpenter. There really isn't much more to be said about Halloween that hasn't been said already. This anniversary edition blu ray is the way to view the film as well with its outstanding transfer. Also, watch Halloween 2 right afterwards for a great late night double feature and if you have time for 3 movies watch part 4 also for an excellent trilogy. Stear clear from the rest of the series though unfortunately.",1469836800,3,1071,4.583333333333333
