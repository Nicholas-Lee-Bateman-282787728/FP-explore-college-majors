6126613,5,B00H1RMPH6,Funny movie!! Great strory. I think for someone that doesnt speak spanish it would probably be hard to understand because they do alot of the spanglish.,1394236800,,152,4.884615384615385

6126615,4,B00H1RMPH6,Omar Chaparro is amazing. It has been a while since I've laughed that hard. The story is bit cheesy but overall is a funny movie.,1393804800,,129,4.2
6126616,3,B00H1RMPH6,"I am a huge fan of Jaime Camil, and I love that he finally has crossed over to do a film with an American actress. I watched Laura Ramsey in She's The Man, but that's the only film I've seen her in. The story line was a little weak, however, and I felt a little disconnect between the two lovers until the end of the movie. Overall, it's a nice feel good love story for people to enjoy.",1393804800,,386,3.9615384615384617

6126618,5,B00H1RMPH6,"I went in watching this movie not expecting too much, and was surprised. It managed to capture, very similar emotions or experiences I've had as a guy. The ups and downs of a meaningful relationship, and the things that sometimes go unsaid. In my opinion it does a great job of doing so in a subtle manner, more so than a great deal of other romantic-comedies. Hope you enjoy it.",1393632000,14,379,4.428571428571429

6126624,5,B00H1RMPH6,"Pulling Strings could be described as a Hallmark- or ABC Family- slanted tale on immigration and the disillusioned system given its PG-rating and the affable plot device that sets events in motion. To leave it at that would be to sell this little gem short! It doesn't have the angst or grit we've come to associate with people striving to get out of dangerous neighborhoods, but that doesn't make the story less effective. The issues unfold at a slower pace, allowing the story to become about our female lead--the lovely Laura Ramsey. She's convincing in the role of a woman who's ""met but never known"" the world around her. She and Jamie Chamil had believable, natural chemistry and create a dynamic that will put a smile on your face. The supporting cast is equally good, and ground the two worlds that the leads exist in. It could've run for an additional few scenes to answer some unresolved plot points, but if you're looking for something that's pleasantly surprising, inoffensive, and watchable, consider this movie!",1448409600,,1025,4.896551724137931

6126631,5,B00H1RMPH6,"We are a bilingual household and we LOVED this movie! It was hilarious, the characters were funny, especially Omar Chaparro's character, with his tight t-shirts and cheesy lines. The only thing I would have improved was the main female character's wardrobe and fixed up her hair a little, but I guess what they were trying to show is that she was all work and no play until she met the mariachi man of her dreams. That's why you see her dressed up at the end. Another reviewer said the daughter character was unattractive. I thought she was super cute! Great movie.",1434585600,,565,4.603960396039604
6126632,5,B00H1RMPH6,"A very lively and entertaining movie (with superb cultural insights).  Jaime Camil, who is an accomplished musician and actor, gives a stellar performance.

6126662,5,B00H1RMPH6,"Like me, there are many people who buy DVDs completely blind not knowing a thing about the movie. Just one more to add to their collection of movies. I LOVE MOVIES. I find them entertaining, therapeutic, educational etc.
If you search for the trailer on youtube, you're going to find so many negative and racist comments down on the comment section. Please, and I REALLY add emphasis on that ""please"", don't let it cloud your judgement. This movie deserves to be watched and have your personal review and opinion on it.
This movie falls under the romantic comedy but there is more to it than another love story. It adds depth by adding culture, music, adventure, a journey that not only makes the characters find each other, but find themselves. I personally have a selective few of ""go to"" that i never get tired of that i usually pop in after a long stressful day and this is definitely being added to my favorites. I never knew Jaime Camil knew english and watching him speak fluently was brilliant. Laura Ramsey is more than just eye candy for the male viewers, she really represents a smart, strong, independent individual who is stunning in every scene. Even in the scenes where shes hungover lol. The supporting characters are also colorful like Canicas. I didn't find him annoying or felt like he was overdoing the comedic act. Like he said in the featurette, every person has a canicas in their life. Hes a loyal, funny guy who you just cant get enough of.
This movie is in bilingual meaning spanish and english are used but the subtitles are very accurate. There is nothing racist about this movie, its a colorful flick that isn't made for oscars or any awards whatsoever, It is a great addition to Cine Mexicano and made to just have a good time.
Give it a try, I love it, hopefully you do too.",1400803200,27,1805,4.574074074074074
6126663,1,B00H1RMPH6,This movie is terrible. The acting was so fake. Canicas (omar chaparro) is the most annoying character ever. Come on!! Lets deliver better mexican films not this garbage.,1400457600,,170,5.107142857142857
6126664,4,B00H1RMPH6,"A nice movie, specially to contrast two cultures: the American and Mexican one. People who enjoy learning about cultures would enjoy this movie, besides the fact to be entertained. It is an interesting story with a romantic ending.",1399334400,3,231,5.105263157894737
6126665,3,B00H1RMPH6,"Yeah Funny but whack. lol, too sad and funny at the same time, kind of bored, and the man is not even a good singer.",1398902400,,116,3.68
6126666,5,B00H1RMPH6,"I loved this movie. Pulling Strings is about falling in love, second chances, forgiveness, joy, hope, pain, music, celebration, and food -(so many human experiences). Not your typical American film with overdone sex scenes and drama. The movie brings you to Mexico City with the language, color, music, enchiladas, tequila shots, traffic jams, and historical landmarks - I thoroughly enjoyed the trip!",1398902400,5,401,5.483870967741935
6126667,5,B00H1RMPH6,"The movie was really good, my wife loved the movie and the actor, Jaime Camil actually sang all the songs which I did not know he was a singer. My parents use to watch him on soaps on tv. I recommend this movie to who ever speaks spanish and english and loves mariachi music,",1397779200,2,275,4.111111111111111
6126668,4,B00H1RMPH6,We watched this movie in order to hear and pick up a little of the Spanish language.  It turns out to be a touching movie.,1397260800,2,122,3.88
6126669,5,B00H1RMPH6,"Just a fun, silly romantic comedy. The leads really light up the screen and the music (songs and score) is great!",1397174400,3,113,4.428571428571429
6126670,1,B00H1RMPH6,"First, the acting was subpar & unrealistic. I hated the Canicas (the best buddy) character who was the Mexican Steppin Fetchin. The main lady in the film was skeleton skinny, had minimal charisma & NO sex appeal. The main guy (Mariachi), couldn't even fake being able to play the guitar though the music was OK & the voice was nice. His daughter looked horrible (couldn't they have found a semi-attractive kid?). The only redeeming quality was the music but you could go out & buy a CD of Mexican music rather than waste your time with these characters.

So if you enjoy watching inferior acting, stereotypical side-kicks, and weakling henchmen who couldn't win a fight with a fly, then be my guest and watch this waste of someone's time.",1397174400,,738,4.72093023255814
