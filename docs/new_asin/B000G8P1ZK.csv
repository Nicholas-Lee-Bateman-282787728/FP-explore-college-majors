Ken Maynard was an American motion picture stuntman and actor --- Born Kenneth Olin Maynard in Vevay, Indiana, he was an accomplished horseman --- As a young man, he performed in rodeos and was a trick rider with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show and a circus rider with Ringling Brothers --- During World War I, he served in the United States Army.

He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work --- Maynard became one of the first singing cowboys with Columbia Records --- Also one of the first to make a star out of his white stallion named ""Tarzan"", a half-Arabian, half-American Saddle horse. Maynard bought him in the mid-1920's --- With his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and pair of six-shooters, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s --- Maynard appeared in more than 90 films --- However, his alcoholism severely impacted his life and his career ended in 1944. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors.

The significant amount of money he had earned vanished and he lived a desolate life in a rundown mobile home --- During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown admirer - long thought to be Gene Autry --- More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to two small parts in films in 1970 and 1972 --- Ken Maynard died penniless in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery in Cypress, California. Maynard's funeral is described in detail in James Horwitz's book They Went Thataway --- His brother, Kermit Maynard, was also an actor and stuntman

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ken Maynard has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6751 Hollywood Blvd -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Our story line and plot, During the 1930-33 westerns Ken Maynard made for Tiffany (in between stints with Universal) are a consistent lot, full of action and wit. Many are off-the-wall comedy or horror elements (like Hoot Gibson, Maynard had a wild sense of humor!) --- ALIAS THE BADMAN is a gritty, straightforward western with Ken as a ranger posing as an outlaw who is posing as a ranger! (have you got that straight) ---  Ken has a politically incorrect stuttering sidekick named ""Repeater"" (Irving Bacon), and silent star Frank Mayo are impressive as the crooked town boss who turns the local ranchers against each other --- But our fine Director Phil Rosen who is better-known for his later mysteries and crime films, but he directed many westerns in the early sound period, and he handles the unique Maynard mix of comedy and action and mystery quite well --- Maynard looks great here too, unlike in some of his later Columbia and Monogram films. An excellent entry in the Maynard series for Tiffany --- Ken Maynard had been a major star in the 1920's famous for his trick riding and daring subnetwork. Unfortunately he had a few too many personal demons and his career steadily declined during the 1930s. This film is from his final solo starring series. He would re-surface briefly over weight and as nasty as ever in the 40s in Monogram's ""Trail Blazer"" with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele --- After that he basically ""retired"" from the screen.
