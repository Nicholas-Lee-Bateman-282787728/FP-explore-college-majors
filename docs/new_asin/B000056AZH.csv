8286003,4,B000056AZH,"Elise (Britt Ekland) is a newly married woman who seems to be having some difficulty getting stepson Marcus (Mark Lester) to like her. She soon begins to suspect that the boy was responsible for his mother's mysterious death. Is Marcus really the prepubescent psychopath that Elise believes him to be, or is he the victim of a neurotic woman's overactive imagination?

Written by Trevor Preston, this horror tale is reminiscent of Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW. The film moves at its own casual pace, but make no mistake, it builds to an ending that packs a punch. James Kelly's direction is professional, relying heavily on Harry Waxman's expert camerawork and Stelvio Cipriani's effective score. Beauteous Britt Ekland finally gets a role that allows her to be more than decorative and she revels in it. Mark Lester gives one of the better children's performances in film. His powerful portrayal will stay with you long after the movie is over. He's a real gem!",1097107200,3,968,4.902439024390244
