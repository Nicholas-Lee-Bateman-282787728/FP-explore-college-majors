8566063,2,B00BCMT4EI,"There is simply no reason to spend money on something this trivial.  Turner Classic Movies offers hundreds of these 1930s ""B"" movies free.  This little comic melodrama was no doubt filmed very quickly, and was shot in three actors' homes. Yes, Charlotte Greenwood is mildly amusing, as is Cliff Edwards.  The remastering job was done successfully.  But the film's plot is extremely superficial and silly, and the writer forgot to insert an ending; the entire film crashes in the last minute.  All in all, this is a movie best forgotten.",1364688000,4,536,4.911111111111111
