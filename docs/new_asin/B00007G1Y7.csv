7976011,4,B00007G1Y7,"1 of the better Nazisploitation films. If you like nude women with the ""70s"" look, like I do, watch this film. Unlike so many of it's kind, this one's got a plot!",1424822400,,162,4.09375
7976012,4,B00007G1Y7,"It is an good story line, for Nazi exploitation films. The only problem I had is the dvd has a skipping proble. No more that the DVD cost, it is not worth the time and effort to send it back. I am happy with the seller. As I have not contacted them, everything is okay.",1415923200,,269,3.909090909090909
7976013,3,B00007G1Y7,Is this based on a true story however so off the beaten track? A bit slow in parts but still good fun.,1380931200,,102,3.6818181818181817
7976014,2,B00007G1Y7,"This is a pale imitation of ilsa she wolf of the s.s.
it was filmed  in the midseventies with even less money than the other movie.  This is a movie for those who want a low budget exploitation movie that is mainly exploitive in regards to soft core sex.
Attractive women agents of elsa try to trick soldiers on leave in their sex train.  the poor soldiers who speak of defeat are then killed.  In real life during the later war years the NAZI's were indeed executing those who criticized hitler and other party ideals and especailly they died  if they talked of defeat.
I don't know if they used entrapments with beautiful women though.  But it's a interesting idea and this bottom budget movie is at least tolerable if you aren't expecting violence exploitation as well as the sexploitation.  The filmmakers were also hoping for a sequel as well with the open ended ending.  So if you want mild sexploitation without alot of extreme violence then this may be ok for you.",1222300800,9,972,4.578034682080925
7976015,1,B00007G1Y7,"I read the previous review a few months ago, but chose to ignore his warning cause the cover art looked too good to pass up.  I wish I would have listened.

Five minutes after the stock footage credits I knew I was in trouble.  At this point in ILSA-SHE WOLF OF THE SS Ilsa had already banged a guy and chopped off his dip stick, but at that point in ELSA there was just a bunch of talking.  Finally after some lame nudity I started the 2x play hoping to get to an exciting point.  Thirty minutes later I was finished.  Nothing had caught my eye.  Boring nudity, deaths only by gunshot and two tame torture scenes.  THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM starring Lance Henriksen had better violence.  And a cool audio clip later used by Ministry on Psalm 69.  ""Liar.  Blasphemer.""",1106611200,26,767,4.330985915492958
7976016,1,B00007G1Y7,"this nazi/erotica exploitation ""film"" fails to deliver the goods in my opinion.for true over-the-top thrills,check out ""ilsa she wolf of the ss""a much more exploitive(and entertaining)exploitation trash cinema masterpiece.",1049155200,22,222,6.689655172413793
