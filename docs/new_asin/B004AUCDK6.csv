4311128,5,B004AUCDK6,"If you loved the old Brave and the Bold comic book from the 1960's - you'll love this series. Just the right amount of fun and humor -  Batman's not so dark and scary in these cartoons, but he is super-cool. A fun-loving, justice-seeking, a-list super hero, who travels the globe (and time) to administer justice.",1304121600,,313,4.589285714285714
4311129,5,B004AUCDK6,"This volume of BATMAN: THE BRAVE & THE BOLD has what I consider the GREATEST BATMAN STORY EVER TOLD, ""Legends of the Dark Mite"".
Its Looney Tunes meets Batman as the little imp from the 5th dimension, Bat-Mite puts Batman through hoops and high water all because he is Batman biggest fan.
The teaser is also FUN with Batman and Ace The Bat-Hound dealing with Cat-Man.

Other Favorites are: Batman and Robin vs Crazy Quilt and the Music Meister.",1303776000,,444,4.620253164556962
4311130,4,B004AUCDK6,This one has a different take one it. Opening each episode with a short. Batman teams up with different DC characters somewhat like the Justice League Unlimited with a different style of animation and story telling.,1303516800,,215,5.0
4311131,3,B004AUCDK6,"From the streets of Gotham City to the farthest reaches of the Galaxy, Batman continues to prove why he's one of DC Comics' greatest heroes in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Season One, Part Two. Batman (Diedrich Bader) is the World's Greatest Detective, but even he could use some heroic help in his relentless pursuit of justice. In this collection of 13 episodes, Batman teams up with Adam Strange, Etrigan the Demon, Huntress, Booster Gold, Jonah Hex, Kamandi, OMAC, Doctor Fate and the Outsiders for some exciting adventures against evildoers of Earth and beyond. If dealing with the mischievous Bat-Mite (Paul Reubens) wasn't bad enough, Batman must also foil the plans of the villain Equinox (Oded Fehr) who seeks to remake the universe in his own image. Based on the comic book series published by DC Comics, this light adaptation offers an amusing mix of old-school comic book action and refreshing humor. The 2-disc DVD set includes such standout episodes like Legends of the Dark Mite!, Hail the Tornado Tyrant!, When OMAC Attacks!, The Last Bat on Earth!, Mayhem of the Music Meister! and The Fate of Equinox!.

Though I'm quite pleased that Warner Brothers has stop the single-disc releases of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, I'm not impressed with overall DVD presentation of its two-disc sets. The last 13 episodes of the first season of animated series are presented 1.78:1 widescreen format. The video transfer look really good and its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is pretty solid. The interactive menus are simple and easy to navigate. Besides the trailer of Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5 game, there are no special features. Overall, Batman: The Brave and the Bold: Season One, Part Two is a decent bargain purchase and scores a ""C+"".",1300492800,,1747,4.922033898305084
4311132,5,B004AUCDK6,"Batman the brave and the bold is an imaginative, bright, colorful, fun, and immensely enjoyable show. Even though this set is not in HD and has no special features, it is still worth the rock bottom price of 15$. If you are a Batman fan, of any kind, this is a must buy. If you enjoy cartoons, this is a must buy. If you are a Batman snob who refuses to recognize the character unless he is in all black and is constantly in pain, you need to get over that, and buy this anyway.

The more copies of this set that sell, the higher the chance becomes that we get a full season collection in HD, or even (gasp) see Warner Brothers do the right thing and release the rest of the series without wasting everyones time by forcing us to buy or ignore their ridiculous single disc releases. Please support this excellent, underrated show, and buy this set.",1300320000,5,848,4.3
4311133,5,B004AUCDK6,"BATMAN: BRAVE AND THE BOLD takes a break from portraying the Dark Knight as a Gloomy Gus. But, no worries, those who miss the more morose version will be happy to note that this sucker's slated for cancellation after three seasons, with a new animated - and darker - Batman series waiting in the wings to restore order. Meanwhile, why not enjoy the ride? This is a really cool show. The hook, of course, is that Batman in each episode teams up with a different superhero. Makes it kinda hard to maintain that brooding loner vigilante rep.

The tone of the stories takes a cue from the breezy jazzy score and from the look of this Batman, his design decidedly inspired from how he was drawn back in the Silver Age, an era in which Batman stories leaned towards the lighthearted. This Batman is pretty chill. He doesn't mind engaging in banter. He even indulges in unashamed alliteration. Where else can you hear Batman throw out over-the-top lines like: ""The Hammer of Justice is unisex!"" or ""Good work, guys. Justice wins the day, thanks to the Brave and the Bold."" The Tick should take notes.

I still got love for Kevin Conroy, but Diedrich Bader is fantastic as the voice of Batman. He's got that good timbre. Granted, I was momentarily out of sorts because, for a while, every time Batman spoke I kept thinking of that borderline creepy (and yet hilarious) character Bader plays in OUTSOURCED.

The episodes are uniformly stand-alone, each kicking off with a teaser segment which often has nothing to do with the main storyline. Two exceptions are ""The Color of Revenge!"" and ""Mayhem of the Music Meister!"" What sets this Batman series apart from the other ones in the past is that the premise opens it up to the entire DC universe, instead of being confined only to the Batman mythos. The recent THE BATMAN, in its fifth and final season, got to play in a bigger sandbox. But BRAVE AND THE BOLD has the run of the entire friggin' park (if you get the analogy).

Gratifyingly, this series features the lesser-known heroes, from Adam Strange to Kamandi to Jonah Hex - and never mind that Bat-Mite doesn't think any of these cats are worthy to ""buff Batman's batarang."" Maybe my favorite team-ups showcase Booster Gold (""Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!"") and Sherlock Holmes (""Trials of the Demon!""). This last one simply begged for a series of one-upmanship, and a sequence in which Batman and Holmes are trading deductions cannot be anything but gold. But, hands down, the best episode in this collection - and, frankly, in the entire series - is the Buffyesque musical episode ""Mayhem of the Music Meister!"" Neil Patrick Harris guest-stars as the Music Meister and he sings up a storm. As does the voice actress -  Grey Delisle - who plays Black Canary. This episode is so awesome that I have to give this collection 5 stars out of 5, instead of my original intended rating of 4 stars (because I'm still a little cheesed that they're holding off on releasing a complete season DVD set).

By the way, I'm still lovin' the series' interpretation of Aquaman as this adventurer who is extroverted, devil-may-care, and prone to bombastic oratory. Again, the Tick should take notes. Jaime Reyes, one of my favorite new characters, gets a spotlight in ""Night of the Huntress!"" as he drools over the Huntress.

BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD - Season One, Part Two is a two-disc set which collects the remaining thirteen episodes of Season One. There are no bonus features, which is supremely uncool (I would've loved to have had an audio commentary or at least a featurette on ""Mayhem of the Music Meister""). Here are the plot breakdowns for the 13 episodes, including bits about the prequel segments (and here's the SPOILER alert):

- Episode #14 - ""Mystery in Space!"" -  Prequel: Bats and the Question try to catch Equinox off-balanced. Then Batman and a peculiarly despondent Aquaman catch a zeta beam to the planet of Rann to help Adam Strange hold off an army of Gordanian invaders.

- Episode #15 - ""Trials of the Demon!"" - Prequel: Batman and the Golden Age Flash take on the Scarecrow and the Scream Queen. Then, in Victorian-era London, Bats and Sherlock Holmes match wits as they investigate a rash of victims being robbed of their very souls. Also, the Demon Etrigan rises, and he brung his rhyming ways.

- Episode #16 - ""Night of the Huntress!"" - Prequel: Bats and Black Canary treat Solomon Grundy like how the Road Runner usually treats Wile E. Coyote. Then, high schooler Jaime Reyes (a.k.a. Blue Beetle) visits Gotham U. and runs into the frankly disturbing crime couple, Baby-Face and Mrs. Man-Face. Jaime also starts crushing on the badassery on legs that is the Huntress.

- Episode #17 - ""Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!"" - Prequel: Bats and Wildcat tangle with Bane. Then, team-up mayhem ensues as opportunistic superhero from the future, Booster Gold, tries to hang out with Batman, purely to increase his marketability.

- Episode #18 - ""The Color of Revenge!"" - Prequel: Batman and Robin sews up that flamboyant fiend, Crazy Quilt. In the main story, Crazy Quilt returns to plague Robin who'd struck out on his own in Bldhaven. The Dark Knight shows up and gets all mentor-y.

- Episode #19 - ""Legends of the Dark Mite!"" - Prequel: Can Batman and Ace the Bat-Hound chase the dastardly Catman up a tree? Then, that other-dimensional imp (and Batman's personal Mr. Mxyzptlk), Bat Mite, puts  the Caped Crusader thru his paces. Loved it when the episode went meta with the Q & A sequence at the Batman convention.

- Episode #20 - ""Hail the Tornado Tyrant!"" - Prequel: Green Arrow and Bats compete to see who can first bring down the Joker. Then, the Red Tornado creates the next-generation Tornado-bot and infuses it with emotion. Uh-oh.

- Episode #21 - ""Duel of the Double Crossers!"" - Prequel: The Outsiders try to keep collateral damage to the city down to a minimum as they tackle Despero. Then, on Warworld, the time-displaced Jonah Hex is beholdin' to Mongol and is forced to work for him as a bounty hunter. And then Batman gets in the way.

- Episode #22 - ""The Last Bat on Earth!"" - Prequel: Bats and Mr. Miracle indulge in escapism. Then Batman pursues Gorilla Grodd into a post-apocalyptic future and teams up with Kamandi, the Last Boy on Earth.

- Episode #23 - ""When OMAC Attacks!"" - Prequel: Batman and Hawk & Dove ""finesse"" a peace treaty between two warring alien races. Then, when Batman's mission for the Global Peace Agency goes fubar, the GPA assigns the One Man Army Corps (OMAC) as his partner.

- Episode #24 - ""The Fate of Equinox!"" - Prequel: Two-Face flips his coin and it lands on the good side, causing him to team up with Batman against his own henchmen. Then, things take a cosmic turn as Dr. Fate and Batman go up against Equinox, who has harnessed the powers of the Lords of Order and Chaos and now seeks to remake the universe.

- Episode #25 - ""Mayhem of the Music Meister!"" - BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD... The Musical!! The Music Meister - he's here to ""settle the score"" - compels our cast of heroes and nogoodniks to burst out into song. But that's not how the Batman rolls.

- Episode #26 - ""Inside the Outsiders!"" - Prequel: Batman and Green Arrow take on Catwoman. Then, the Psycho-Pirate, who manipulates and feeds on emotions, efs with Batman and the Outsiders.",1300233600,13,7332,4.6850699844479005

4311135,5,B004AUCDK6,"I'm giving this four stars. Not on how their dragging their
feet, putting these shows on dvd. But rather, 4 stars to the
show itself. I'm a ""HUGE"" fan of Batman: The Animated Series.
However, you simply can't compare that show with Brave And The
Bold. This newest incarnation of Batman pays homage to the Batman
of the early to late 60s. The character designs are also evident
tribute to that of Batman creator, Bob Kane and Dick Sprang (*this show's Joker
is definately fasioned after Sprang's classic design*)
 In addition to those Golden age Batman comics, there's also
repeated nods to the Adam West television series of the same
time period. (*Robin's holy this and that, the Shakespear bust,
the hidden batpoles, Batcave atomic pile, Joker's giant
clam, ect, ect*)
 The show's writers are clever and the show's toungue and
cheek humor is outstanding. And just when you thought that
Kevin Conroy was the only man in the world to do Batman's voice,
you're then introduced to Diedrich Bader's outstanding
Batman. Anyway, a show that should not be missed.",1291680000,26,1057,4.866666666666666
4311139,5,B004AUCDK6,"I'm a huge Batman fan from my childhood, though I have gained much more respect for him over the last decade as I played catch-up with his mythology and refreshed my knowledge of his methodology.

4311140,5,B004AUCDK6,"After picking this up on a whim, I was shocked how good it was.  The musical episode is delightful, and Batman is just brilliant during it.  ""Was the singing really necessary?""

Classic Catwoman!  Love her.  ""Flirterers!""  I would kill for a Classic Catwoman series.

It is marred by the most jerkish Sherlock Holmes ever.  The author of that episode really hated Holmes.",1376697600,,371,4.870967741935484
4311141,5,B004AUCDK6,"I love this TV show because it shows how even superheroes make mistakes and own up to them. Even they aren't perfect. I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about. Marvel seems to be in it for the money, but DC Comics seems to care about the relation between the viewer and the characters on the show; making sure you can connect to some of the characters in a personal way.",1374364800,,402,4.233766233766234

4311143,5,B004AUCDK6,"Growing up during the 90s, I loved Batman the Animated Series, my father's favorite of the cartoons he watched with me.  Even when it changed the animation style & got worse, there were still some excellent stories that made it worth watching.  I loved all the other DC Animated series too, especially Justice League, my favorite of them all.  But then The Batman came along, & I thought Batman would never have a good cartoon again, until this proved me wrong.  I tried the episode Death Race to Oblivion & loved it.  It's not my Batman, but this is a heck of a lot more entertaining & better produced than the Adam West show.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

14.  Mystery In Space!:  Aquaman (depressed after being unable to stop a beluga whale hunt in the Bering Sea) accompanies Batman to the planet Rann to help space hero Adam Strange stop the Gordanian General Kreegar from obtaining the Eye of Zared and destroying Rann.  Good episode, but the best part was the teaser with Equinox.  B

15.  Trials of the Demon!:  After thwarting Crazy Quilt's art robbery, Batman is taken to 19th century London by Jason Blood's magic to help Jason Blood when he's framed for a series of crimes committed by Jim Craddock who is stealing souls for Astaroth for immortality.  Etrigan and Batman are aided in their investigations by the legendary Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  This is a really good episode that is strangely superior to Etrigan's appearance on The Animated Series (One of the worst episodes if you ask me).  A+

16.  Night of the Huntress!:  With the help of Blue Beetle and Huntress, Batman fights the criminal activities of Babyface and his wife Mrs. Manface when they break out their old gang from Blackgate Penitentiary.  Meanwhile, Blue Beetle develops a huge crush on Huntress.  A great episode with a lot of fun characters (I especially like this new Blue Beetle; I'll have to pick up some of his comics).  A

17.  Menace of the Conqueror Caveman:  Coming from the 25th Century, Booster Gold travels back in time to join Batman and become a celebrity hero.  In his quest for fame following Batman stopping Punch and Jewelee's bank robbery, he unwittingly enables the immortal tyrant Kru'll The Eternal to carry out his nefarious plot when Kru'll kidnaps Booster Gold's robot Skeets.  Pretty good episode featuring my favorite C-list DC character, apart from the Question, but I don't know how high he ranks on the DC scale.  Only problem is I thought Kru'll was a poor man's version of Vandal Savage, but that's okay.  B+

18.  The Color of Revenge!:  In the past, Batman and Robin foil Crazy Quilt's plot to rob an Art Museum.  In the present, Batman and Robin once again team up...but it's different since Robin left Batman.  When Crazy Quilt gets revenge on Robin for blinding him, it's up to the Dynamic Duo to save the day once again!  A great episode focusing on the relationship of the Duo.  A

19.  Legends of the Dark Mite!:  Bat-Mite, Batman's biggest fan from the 5th Dimension, pops up and kidnaps his idol intending to make Batman a better hero.  This is the episode that made me want to see the show in the first place when I heard about it.  Every Batman fan should see this as it references many versions of the character.  A+

20.  Hail the Tornado Tyrant!:  Feeling lonely, Red Tornado builds a son named Tornado Champion that has the one thing he lacks: human emotion.  However, the experiment goes haywire when Major Disaster appears, and the Champion is reborn as the Tornado Tyrant.  A surprisingly somber episode.  A

21.  Duel of the Double Crossers:  Mongul saves Jonah Hex's life but then forces Hex to work as his bounty hunter in order to recruit soldiers for his Warworld.  Hex captures Batman and reveals that he is working off a debt that will allow him to return to his own time.  On Warworld, Batman fights Steppenwolf and other aliens in Mongul's gladiator arena.  Jonah Hex also has his encounters with Mongul's sister Mongal and her fighters Lashina and Stompa.  He and Batman try to free the aliens.  Jonah Hex episodes in DC animation are always good.  A

22.  Last Bat on Earth:  Batman chases Gorilla Grodd into the future (who used the technology of Professor Carter Nichols) and teams up with Kamandi to stop him.  When Gorilla Grodd takes over leadership of the Gorilla Men from Ramjam, Batman tries to convince Prince Tuftan's father Great Caesar to help fight Gorilla Grodd.  A different but enjoyable episode.  And I love the beginning with Mister Miracle.  A-

23.  When OMAC Attacks:  After Batman's mission to stop the villainous Doctor Kafka goes awry, Equinox manipulates the metal man Shrapnel into attacking a city, but Batman and GPA operative OMAC team up to stop him.  A good episode.  B+

24.  The Fate of Equinox:  Equinox tries to remake the universe in his own image using the powers of the Lords of Chaos and Order as Batman and Doctor Fate work together with other heroes to stop him.  One of the most epic episodes.  A+

25.  Mayhem of the Music Meister:  The Music Meister uses his power to control people with music to try to take over the world and it's up to Batman, Black Canary, Aquaman and Green Arrow to stop him.  A hilarious musical episode with an excellent soundtrack.  Episodes like this would have never worked on The Animated Series.  A+

26.  Inside the Outsiders:  Upon learning that the Outsiders (Black Lightning, Katana, and Metamorpho) have gone missing, Batman goes up against Psycho-Pirate to stop him from converting their emotional weaknesses into his strength.  A really good character-based episode.  A+

I will definitely buy the others when I see them at good prices.  I just got this one first because it had my 2 favorite episodes on it (Legends of the Dark Mite & Mayhem of the Music Meister)  This show is a lot better than I gave it credit for.",1369785600,,5892,4.690196078431373
4311144,5,B004AUCDK6,"I am a person that has always loved watching cartoons from the very moment I watched Saturday Morning cartoons like Space Ghost and Birdman and the Galaxy Trio.  Even The Herculoids.  This show brought back those memories and it was fantastic.  Dietrich Bader was great as Batman and every superhero that teamed up with Batman, was a joy to watch.  The only exception to my saying this particular statement was of course, the superhero Aquaman.  It was still at this time that Aquaman was not to be taken seriously and to me, that hurt the character's potential for hoping to be taken seriously and not become the joke that he did by being on this show.  The New 52 DC Comics have done a lot to bring Aquaman to a new level where he can now be seen as the serious and dedicated superhero that I remember from before.  Anybody that remembers those animated series I mentioned above will really enjoy this DVD collection",1368057600,,918,4.560975609756097
4311145,4,B004AUCDK6,"Even though this series was lacking classic villains in whole episodes, not just the first few minutes only! It still was very colorful and inventive.  The stories was also good.  I like the Music Meister.  It was fun to see The heroes and villains put on a musical.  That sort of made me laugh.  Where is Season two part one>! Oh wait, I already have it! I bought the whole series in 2013, so I could watch them all at once... i never even watched them on live TV because I buy my TV series on DVD.  no commercials and I get to watch them when I want!

4311146,4,B004AUCDK6,"This was my personal favorite of the may animated Batman series made since the 80's.  It is a light-hearted but not overly campy Silver Age Batman combined with just about every major and minor super hero or super villain in the DC universe.  Even fans of the much more serious DCAU will love these.  TDK and TDKR fans may not enjoy them so much without a child or 2 present...

I hoped for some additional content with the DVD set but sadly there is none.  This is the only reason I did not give this 5 stars, however I do like that the DVD's load immediately to the DVD menu and not the obligatory commercials that can not be skipped.  I thank WB for acknowledging that we already spent the money to purchase these and deserve to be spared the advertising push.  If only more DVD distributors would take note.",1367107200,,811,4.366666666666666

4311148,5,B004AUCDK6,"Camp, fun and a great nod and love letter to the silver age way of story telling for comics.
BBATB is a show that indulges in the wacky antics of that time in comics that had fun with its source material and not take it so so seriously and make it dark and morbid.
The show does occasionally travel into serious tone stories but never loses its feeling of a show that makes uses of the greater DC Comic universe.
it uses a lot of DC Comic characters not just Batman.
We get to see a revision of Aquaman that has become a fan favorite [if only he got a spin-off] and we get golden age heroes like Plastic Man.

4311160,5,B004AUCDK6,"You won't find a dark, on the edge, bitter Batman in this series.  In my opinion this is the way he should be portrayed...relatively happy, heroic, witty, and still tough. Our family has watched these episodes a number of times, and have thoroughly enjoyed each one of them. The prequel mini stories before the title sequence are very entertaining as well.
We are all comic book fans(thus my name..golden age superman) and it has been a great pleasure to see the spotlight on some of DC's lesser known characters. The stories are well written, extremely humorous and action packed. While all the shows are great, if I had to pick my top two from this DVD, they would be:""Mystery in Space!""...Batman and Aquaman go to the planet Rann to help Adam Strange, and ""Mayhem of the Music Meister!"" is a truly unique portrayal of a number of DC heroes and villains, as they battle under the lyrical mind controlling tones of the Music Meister.
I am a fan of the 90's Batman animated show, and while it is a strong series in its own right, this one tops it in my book. Both series are strong and stand on their own merits. They are two ends of the spectrum on how Batman has been portrayed through the years.  I highly recommend this series for young and old alike who want to see a high quality animated series, whether you are a Batman fan or not.",1345852800,,1339,4.461224489795918

4311162,5,B004AUCDK6,"I'll admit the reason to own this set (besides owning the second half of season one) is ""Mayhem of the Music Meister"". I've showed it to three different people and each one said that it was different, in a good way. It was fun seeing the heroes and villains sing (especially the Adam West villains). Even one of my parents said that the music was great and enjoyable (even singing a bit of the songs). Though I wish they'd show the episodes on this set in airing order vs. productions order as ""Inside the Outsiders"" is a weaker episode to end on than ""The Fate of Equinox"". Speaking of Equinox, I liked the character but I feel he could've worked better if he were featured in more episodes and if the seasons had been split to 13 episodes like ""Teen Titans"" and ""The Batman"". The first set ended with the Owlman episodes and though the first half didn't have an arc, it still featured every hero that had been on the show up to that point. The first half of season two is the ""Invasion of Starro"" arc and the last half of season two had a couple episodes hinting at Darkseid's attack on Earth, which led to the formation of Justice League International. I know these aren't story arcs per se since there were only three episodes that featured Equinox and only two episodes that featured Darkseid and his invasion but the bits featured in the teasers and full episodes link together, at least that's what I picked up from it anyway. Other episodes I enjoyed were ""Trials of the Demon"" which had Batman teaming with Sherlock Holmes and the origin of Gentleman Ghost, ""The Color of Revenge"" explains why Robin left Batman (and is a bit of a jerk to his mentor) and an homage to the Adam West show and ""Legends of the Dark Mite"" guest starring Paul Reubens as Bat-Mite, who is definitly not as annoying as he was in ""The New Adventures of Batman"" from the '70s. I love the self-referential humor to the many incarnations of Batman and on how the show over-exposes Gorilla Grodd (seriously the character was better in ""Justice League"", all he does in this show is the same thing! Just get rid of him!) Also the fifth dimension's convention and Bat-Mite's dream sequence (with him imitating the end of B:TAS' opening credits) are great scenes. It's great to see some other, lesser known characters get some screen and speaking time such as Adam Strange, Crazy Quilt, Calendar Man, Kamandi (another character I wish they wouldn't use, he's just boring), OMAC (though I'll admit he looks a tad ridiculous) and Psycho Pirate. The voice casting is again excellent, such as the already mentioned Paul Reubens as Bat-Mite, Jeffrey Tambor as Crazy Quilt, Oded Fehr as Equinox and the impressive Neil Patrick Harris as the Music Meister. Though there have been episodes featuring musical numbers, I have mixed feelings about them doing another full-on musical episode; I'd like to see another but I have a feeling that it won't do as well. Oh well, it wouldn't be any worse than Spider-Man having a full Broadway musical!",1314144000,2,3009,4.6367041198501875

There are some sexual references, many of the females look like porn stars and there is some graphic violence for a young child to see.  I wish cartoonists would remember that young children are who they should be marketing to and making these types of movies for.  If they want to sex it up, then go into the full on porn industry.

It took me by surprise , I really didn't expect that .. way to go DC ,it was a refreshing new idea (I haven't heard of the Music Meister before this episode) . I haven't seen heroes and villains get humiliated in that kind of fashion  .. oh poor black manta XD ... I just LOVE this episode . Thank you DC for bringing such a wonderful character .. plain genius . Now I'm a MM fan :)",1309392000,,480,3.948453608247423
4311166,5,B004AUCDK6,"I ordered the first season of Batman:  The Brave and The Bold (comes on two separate DVD purchases).  My 5-year-old grandson watches them so often that even the adults in the household know the episodes by heart.  They are primarily classic Batman physical conflict episodes; however, they have also incorporated moral and ethic messages (rather like the old ""GI Joe"" series) that may or may not make an impact on your child.  Certainly, you can increase the likelihood of the message getting through if you point them out.  All-in-all, we judge these to be a quite successful purchase.",1307577600,,586,4.938775510204081
4311167,4,B004AUCDK6,"The series was working. Letting the ""second string"" heroes of D.C. get some face time was a great way of bringing the old time fans and introducing them to a new generation.  The stories are throwbacks to the comics of the 1960's and 1970's. Good stories with entertainment for all and no need to have excessive gore or complex subplots.  Good for any fan or just to sit around an watch with your kids.",1304899200,,402,4.418918918918919

8420864,5,B004AUCDK6,"Absolutely worth the wait !  Have seen clips of the episodes on YouTube, and finally decided to purchase both sets for Season 1 as Christmas present to myself. Love the homage to the silver age (1950s) era of comics, and the shows have a nice balance of light comedy and seriousness to keep viewers of all ages interested !  Yes, it's not 'Batman: The Animated Series', but it's not trying to imitate it.  Just as B:TAS was sort of 'set' in the 1930s in that 'Dark Deco' style, this calls to mind the comics of the 1950s, with villains such as Poison Ivy, who wasn't around until the '60s, included. Definitely looking forward to purchasing Season 2 !",1453593600,,651,4.5

8420870,3,B004AUCDK6,"I wish I only had to do ONE review for ONE of each season, but because these money hungry greedy company's are splitting these seasons into parts much like movie's are now being split into two sequels for ripping off customers, never mind, what does my complaint matter? This show is rather good, more kid oriented compared to the original 1990's Batman: The Animated Series, but FAR bigger improvement over the 2004's The Batman. I wish there would be less cameos in the opening of the episodes and just use those villains more, my all time favorite Batman villain Two-Face NEVER got his own episode with Batman other than brief appearances in the opening before the credits and show starts.
