12701,3,0767726227,"I love Mel Brooks. When I heard he's having a collection coming out on Blu Ray, I was excited.

If you're a Mel Brooks fan, this is a no brainer. Now for the dissappointing aspects.

This box set WILL NOT fit on your DVD rack without there being some major changes to the layout of your entertainment center. The Blu Ray/book/jacket/thing is roughly the same size as a hard bound coffee table book. It's clunky and it falls apart easily (the binding agents ""glue"" was weak on my copy. To top it off, you're sliding Blu Ray discs up against straight up card stock inserts to get them out. It's more of an annoyance than anything, but if you can see through that, you're set.

You'll also notice that there's some movies missing. I'm not saying that Dracula: Dead and loving it should be wiped clean from human memory, but it's the completitionist in me that would like to see all his works in something named ""Collection"". It's really not a collection, isn't it. More like a ""greatest hits"", or ""The ones we want you to remember him by"". I was somewhat suprised that The Producers wasn't in this collection either. Was that 10th or 11th movie going to disrupt the balance of the box set and set the world ablaze? probably not, I'm guessing it was those two timing Hollywood lawyers that kept my dream from becoming a reality.

Long story short, Terri Garr was insanely hot and everybody knows that Druish princesses are attacted to money and power, and Darth Helmet has both.",1261526400,178,1474,4.550943396226415

The discs are housed in a book structure with each disc going bare into a slot on a page - kind of like last year's Borzage Murnau set? With all of the scratched discs? In other words, this looks like another packaging nightmare from the folks at Fox/MGM who seem to keep doing this to their prestige sets to the great chagrin of consumers.

13079,4,0767726227,"This is a compact collection and doesn't take up much space on your shelf. Each of the 8 movie discs is in its own slim-line case. I've decided to keep just three of the movies and give the rest away.

Only 2 of the movie discs have substantial Bonus Features, a couple of which I recommend. The audio interview on the ""Blazing Saddles"" disc is very interesting. Find out what John Wayne said after reading the script.  Hear how Gene Wilder ""saved my life."" It's worth it just for the story of Madelaine Kahn's audition.

I also recommend the Mel Brooks commentary on ""Young Frankenstein"". It's not the best commentary ever, but it was fun for the extra stories.

Notably, this collection does not include Brook's directorial debut, ""The Producers"", for which he also won an Academy Award for the screeplay. It also doesn't have ""Spaceballs"" (1987) and ""Life Sucks"" (1993), which are no big loss to me. Finally, the last film Brooks directed, ""Dracula: Dead and Loving it"" (1995), is not included. It is a family favorite and we have it on separate DVD.

This is a review of the DVD set. The movies in this collection have differing spoken and subtitle language options, and I've given those.

1.  ""The Twelve Chairs"" (1970) There are some good sight gags, but they almost come off as comedy sketches, rather than a cohesive movie. 3 stars for me.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twelve-Chairs-The/dp/B000G6BLT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twelve Chairs, The</a>
Spoken language options: English Spanish.  Subtitle options: English, Spanish
Bonus Feature:  ""Mel Brooks Theater"" Trailers for six Mel Brooks films.

2.  ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974) The three years before ""Blazing Saddles"" came out were lean years for Mel Brooks. He needed a hit to stay in Hollywood, and he got it with this send-up of the Western genre, not to mention its poke in the eye to racism. Madeline Kahn got -an Oscar nomination for her impression of Marlene Dietrich. Still, I barely found it funny. 3.6 stars rounded up to 4.

Spoken language options: English, French, Spanish.  Subtitle options: English, French, Spanish
Bonus Features:
....A.  Cast. A list to read of the cast members and their bios.
....B.  Production Notes. Four pages of notes to read on the screen. In 1984, Mel Brooks won the WGA (Writers Guild of America) Award for Best-Written Original Screenplay for ""Blazing Saddles"".
....C.  Interview with Mel Brooks (62 minutes) The interview is audio only, so they've run it while playing the movie in the background. There are no subtitles for the interview itself. I think the interview dates from around 1998.
Mel's idea was to do a black comedy, ""literally, black comedy."" He was a fan of Richard Pryor, who hadn't hit stardom yet. ""So I called Richie..."" and they wrote the first draft with a bunch of other writers: working title ""Black Bart."" As Mel continues, ""We didn't know the words 'politically incorrect'."" They were actually more worried bout getting the f*a*r*t*ing scene past the studio.
....D.  Theatrical Trailers
....E.  Film Flash

3.  ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) This is a 5-star family comedy, brilliant with slapstick and subtleties. Well, OK, usually not so subtle. In the Mel Brooks interview which is a bonus feature on the ""Blazing Saddles"" disc, Brooks calls this movie ""a gift"". Obviously a lot of hard work and talent were needed too, but it is a film where everything comes together wonderfully. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks were nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Frankenstein/dp/B000G6BLWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Frankenstein</a>
Spoken language options: English, French, Spanish. Subtitle option: English
Bonus Features:
....A.  Director's Commentary. (no subtitle for commentary) Re-watch the movie with Mel Brooks telling stories and explaining filming decisions. I enjoy film commentaries and this one did not disappoint. Brooks brings up casting and B&W lighting, music and pauses and inflection for effect. Above all, the sets and lighting: ""The camera-work had to marry the material.""
....B.  ""Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein"" (36 minutes, subtitles available) This enjoyable featurette was filmed in 1996. It features Gene Wilder (plays Frankenstein), Michael Gruskoff (producer), Stan Allen (assistant editor), Gerald Hirschfeld (cinematographer) and Bill Gordean (assistant editor). They talk about the genesis of the story and how everybody worked together.
When ""Young Frankenstein"" was being filmed, no Hollywood studio had issued a movie in B&W for 7 years. The studio said it had to be filmed in color. Per Hirschfeld, ""Mel was very adamant about the fact that if they were going to do it in color, he wasn't going to direct it.... Mel said, ..."" we really want it to be more than the original.""
....C.  Trailers. Five slightly different trailers for this movie. ""It's coming, from the deep dark recesses of the mind of Mel Brooks.""
....D.  TV Spots. Four minutes of different-length TV commercials.
....E.  Deleted Scenes (17 minutes total) There's 7 deleted scenes in all. The 1st is the longest, and was originally going to be the beginning of the movie
....F.  Mexican Interviews (7 minutes) Marty Feldman, Gene Wilder and Cloris Leachman are in costume in these short interviews filmed with a Mexican host. Feldman explains that his ""hump"" is a ""pregnant pad"" someone found in the stock department.
....G.  Outtakes (5 minutes) There was a lot of laughter on this set.
....H.  Production Photographs

4.  ""Silent Movie"" (1976) This was an OK movie for me = 3 stars. Living up to its name, there really are no voices in this movie, only sound effects with captions for dialogue. It feels like a TV show, rather than a movie. But I did like Marcel Marceau's cameo.

Spoken language options: English, French, Spanish.  Subtitle option: English
Bonus Feature:  Theatrical trailer

5.  ""High Anxiety"" (1977) This is Brook's homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. It's fun to see if you can pick out the specific scenes which are a take on a Hitchcock scene. As I love Hitchcock, this raised ""High Anxiety"" to 4 stars for me.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Anxiety/dp/B000G6BLQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Anxiety</a>
Spoken language options: English, French and Spanish.  Subtitle options: English, Spanish
No Bonus Feature

6.  ""History of the World Pt 1"" (1981) Here and there, some good schtick. The humor is very broad, certainly politically incorrect for our times. Another okay = 3 stars for me.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-Of-The-World-Pt1/dp/B000G6BLRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History Of The World Pt1</a>
Spoken language options: English, French.  Subtitle options: English, Spanish
Bonus Feature: Theatrical trailer

7.  ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1983) I thought this was 4 stars, a movie reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 40's (except it's in color). Anne Bancroft stars and she is lovely and lively. She and Mel were very happily married until the day she died.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Be-Or-Not-To-Be/dp/B000G6BLYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Be Or Not To Be</a>

Bonus Features:
....A.  Written Profiles on 3 actors
....B.  Theatrical trailers

8.  ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (1993) Gags run from silly to low-brow, but Roger Rees, as the Sheriff of Rottingham, is played with perfect petulance. 4 stars for me.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Men-in-Tights/dp/B000G6BLW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood - Men in Tights</a>

A decent set overall. Not all of the films are keepers for me, but ""Young Frankenstein"" makes up for a lot.

Mel Brooks is one of the best Comedic Directers EVER!  And This encompeses his best work.  9 Movies from the 1970's through the 1990's.
  I Particularly Love Young Frankenstein & History of the World Part 1.  I mean, who wouldn't love a singing & dancing Frankenstein's Monster or Marty Feldman moving his hunchback around (What Hump?)?  Or the Hilarious send up of history/biblical tales that Brooks provides (I bring you these 15....Crash!  OY! These 10, yes 10 Commandments!)?  Or poking fun of racism & social mores (Blazing Saddles) that Brooks provides?  Let's face it, regardless of which Brooks' movies you prefer....You will NEVER get a bad one & ALWAYS laugh with any of his movies.  And with this set, no matter how many times you watch ANY of these films, they will always be as funny, if not funnier, as the first time you watch them.
  If you don't have this set, you owe it to yourself to get it",1393113600,,1098,4.47979797979798

Six films are brand new to Blu-ray in this set. Overall, the picture quality is very good but the audio quality is fairly average (High Anxiety and The Twelve Chairs don't sound great but otherwise the sound quality is good). All the significant special features from the DVD versions have been ported over and there is plenty of exclusive content for fans. There is over 7.5 hours of total bonus content plus 4 audio commentaries (Twelve Chairs has only a trailer). You also get an exclusive 120-page book in this release. My only real complaint is that the packaging is somewhat flimsy.

The set has recently been re-released at a substantially lower price, packaged in a 9-disk blue plastic case of standard height and width, sans the book. Instead there is a simple 16-page pamphlet tucked into the front cover.

The discs and extras are the same as the first release. ""The Producers"" is still not included because it's still not distributed by Fox, as are the 9 included titles.",1343606400,9,634,4.754545454545455

13119,4,0767726227,"I finally got done watching the whole set and I am impressed.  I am a pretty big Mel Brooks fans, but there were a few movies on here I had never seen, so it was nice to finally catch them.  I won't break down the individual movies, because anyone buying this set is most likely already a Mel Brooks fan anyway.

The video quality is pretty good, especially if you consider when most of these movies were made.  The quality is certainly better than any version released prior.  The audio on some track can show its age, but it generally sounds good.  Most movies, but not all, contain large amounts of bonus features including deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, etc.

The case is large and will not fit on most dvd racks.  The discs come in a large book with sleeves.  These type of sleeves always worry me that I will scratch the disc taking out or putting them in.  The collection also comes with a large book that tells the history of Mel Brooks and his movies.  The book has some very interesting information that you probably haven't read anywhere else before.

One major complaint is that the collection doesn't include ""The Producers"", but that can be overlooked because of all the great movies it does have.

Overall, if you are a Mel Brooks fan, you must own this.",1323043200,8,1274,4.510917030567685

13147,5,0767726227,"The obvious flaw in this blu-ray collection of 9 Mel Brooks films is that it does not include all of Brooks's movies, most notably The Producers. I admit that I'm inclined to forgive this because I already own that movie (probably my favorite comedy of all time) on DVD, and am perfectly happy not to double-up on owning it; and I also don't mind not having Life Stinks or Dracula: Dead and Loving It, as those are my two least favorite Brooks movies. So, yes, some movies are missing, and that is a totally valid criticism of this set.

Looking at what is included, we see a whole lot of greatness. I particularly love Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, and Spaceballs, but even films that were less successful, like To Be or Not To Be, are at least enjoyable. The picture and sound quality are excellent, but I don't consider myself an expert on that subject: Blu-ray's great, but I think DVDs look pretty fantastic, too, so once you reach that level of quality, I'm pretty happy with the presentation. The hardcover book that comes with the box is really nice, a loving tribute to the comedic master. Some other reviewers gripe about how the discs sit in their slots, and I would too, if these were CDs that I expected to take out frequently. Since they're movies, which I'm sure to watch a number of times, but not every day, I don't think these slots will prove to be harmful to them.

Overall, though it doesn't include every one of his films, this collection stands out as being a great presentation of 9 films, many of them classics. As a life-long Mel Brooks fan, I definitely recommend it.",1318204800,4,1629,4.575342465753424
13148,5,0767726227,Very nice collection! Included was a great book on the best of Mel Brooks!  Collection included all the best material but am looking forward to another collection which should include The Producers! More more Mel Brooks!,1318204800,,220,5.111111111111111
13149,5,0767726227,"This is the essential collection for any Mel Brooks film. With a few exceptions, this is the first time many of these films have been available in stunning Blu-Ray.

The only negatives of this collection is the lack of two films, The Producers and Dracula: Dead and Loving It. That being said, this is not a matter of some producer saying ""Lets not add these films"", so much as it is that the studio does not have the rights to these movies (MGM owns the rights to The Producers and Columbia owns Dracula: Dead and Loving It). Its a shame, but there's nothing that can be done. At least they added ""To Be or Not to Be"", which, while not directed by Mr. Brooks, does star him and his wife. Either way, Dracula was his worst film and isn't entirely missed except maybe from a completionist perspective, so really, only The Producers is missed.

Hopefully soon The Producers will be released on Blu Ray to put on display with this boxset, but until then, this is a great collection and for a great price! Highly recommended!",1317772800,7,1021,4.483870967741935

13151,5,0767726227,"Mel Brooks is by far, the greatest entertainer to ever live. There is nothing he can't do or hasn't done. This collection is a nice showcase of some highlights of his career. As many mention there are some movies missing, most notably the producers which as of the date of this review, is not yet available on blu ray. But so what, I'll enjoy my DVD until it does come out. So instead of whining about what isn't there, sit back and thoroughly enjoy what IS included. I don't need to sit here and tell you movie by movie why they are great, you should already know that by now. Buy this, cherish it, watch each film over and over again, and maybe you can remember not to take life so seriously anymore.

Carl Reiner to Mel Brooks:

Carl - ""Mel, out of all the girlfriends and wives and women you have had in your life, who was the best?""
Mel - ""Shirley""
Carl - ""Why Shirley, what was so great about her?""

This compilation contains Mel Brooks` interpretation of famous movie milestones of the last century, most of them having become milestones themselves.
From the master of reinterpretation and anachronisms. The more movie classics you have seen, the more you will laugh watching these delightfully funny parodies and parabels.",1312329600,,406,5.4603174603174605

13154,5,0767726227,"Since I grew up in the 80's, I grew up with Mel Brooks' films. I have been a fan for as long as I can remember. When I saw this set listed on Amazon for $45.99, I couldn't pass it up. I must say that Fox has outdone themselves here. Those of you who have been buying Fox's DVDs and blu-rays probably know that there is nothing special about the majority of them, as many are lacking special features, etc. But not so with this set. First of all, the video transfers on all nine movies are simply incredible. I have watched all of these movies on DVD in the past, and the blu-ray versions just blows them all away. Every movie also has an impressive collection of special features. These include excellent documentaries (many of which are in HD), deleted scenes, trailers, TV Spots, etc. My only (albeit small) complaint here is that I wish more of the films had commentaries, because I love listening to Mel talk about the making of his movies. He is funny, witty, and he tells a great story. Also included is a 119-page, hard-bound book which talks about the making of all nine films. I am still in the process of reading it, but so far there is a lot of information about the making of the movies that I had not known before. My only other complaint about this set is that it is missing The Producers, Life Stinks, and Dracula: Dead and loving It. It really is too bad that these films were left out for whatever reason, but when they are finally released on blu, I will pick them up just the same. The bottom line is that if you are a fan of Mel Brooks' movies, then you simply can't go wrong here. You will not be sorry.",1308528000,74,1624,4.258899676375404

I was very disappointed that The Producers was skipped (especially since it was the first film he directed) which is why it got 4 stars.  Not quite so much that Dead and Loving It and Life Stinks were excluded.  Many BR-disks/DVD's support mouse use when playing through a PC, but these disks do not.  Not a huge issue, but a quibble nonetheless.",1306800000,,420,4.473684210526316
13188,4,0767726227,"As others have stated, if you enjoy Mel Brooks, you will definitely enjoy this. The video transfer is excellent; I was surprised by how clean and crisp movies like Blazing Saddles looked (barring a couple of moments). It was also a great opportunity to watch some of Mel's earlier work that I had never seen before. It is good to see that they hold up well without being looked through the lens of nostalgia.

If you are purchasing this collection to watch outside of the US, please be aware that it is region free, with the exception of Young Frankenstein, which strangely is region A (US) only. But as this collection has not been reprinted locally (that I am aware of), it is not much trouble to simply purchase a local Blu-ray copy of Young Frankenstein to replace it.

It is unfortunate that The Producers (and Life Stinks, and Dead and Loving It) are not included in this collection, but I assume that they were unable to obtain the rights to include them. The packaging is also rather bulky and non-standard, but it does include a great companion book telling the stories behind the movies.",1304121600,3,1097,4.62051282051282

13193,5,0767726227,"Mel Brooks will go down in history as one of the most creative and brilliant comical minds in the film industry. From the classic and ground-breaking Blazing Saddles to the silly and witty Men in Tights, each of Brooks' films offer riotously funny moments from beginning to end that will forever remain in a class of its own. Mel Brooks made it a point to how absurd political correctness can be and that everything can be the butt of a good laugh. In today's overly sensitive world, we could use another Mel Brooks to bring back the humor in everyday life. While I admit some things are still quite iffy in regards to comical exposure, it's absurd how sensitive people have become. Mel Brooks will forever be a legend of comedy, and this box-set is a great homage to his greatness. I'm done licking off the bottom of his shoes now, but seriously this is great and I'm glad I picked it up when it was on sale for $46.99.

Placed it back in and had the same problem.  We couldn't play approximately 2-3 chapters of the movie.  We skipped ahead and the rest played fine.

13212,5,0767726227,"MEL BROOKS IS A GENIUS.  Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles have been on my top 10 list of movies (numbers 2 and 3 respectively) since they first came out.  That has been many years ago and nothing has been able to knock them out of their slots.  With the exception of my number one favorite movie, I have watched Young Frankenstein more times than any other movie.  I still quote lines from it to this day.

While the other movies in the set are all worth watching over and over, I think To Be Or Not To Be was and still is overlooked.  It is a truly great film.

You cannot go wrong with this set.",1274227200,,603,4.146551724137931
13213,5,0767726227,"Great collection, nicely packaged with a coffee table book. Should have included 'Dracula, Dead And Loving It', but a great collection nevertheless.",1272153600,,148,5.7727272727272725
13214,5,0767726227,"I'm going to keep this review short and to the point. Everyone should be familiar with Mel Brooks' body of work at this point and know that his movies are second to none when it comes to comedy. This box set includes seven of his best films and doesn't dissapoint. The special features are great and plenty and the biography book included was a great read and a nice addition. Although this set is rather large and some might find it difficult to fit it into your collection I think it looks great on the shelf, catches peoples attention and makes them want to pull it out and relive these comedy classics. I would deffinatly recomend this set for any Mel Brooks fans and if you aren't familiar with his work then shame on you and you should really definatly buy this.",1269993600,6,768,4.415492957746479
13215,5,0767726227,"Wonderful Transfers.  I don't think anyone doesn't know the plot of any of these movies, except maybe Twelve Chairs, so there's no need going there.  Great collection.  Well packaged.  Some have complained about the sleeves but Blu-Ray is supposed to be more scratch resistant isn't it?  Anyway transfer them to cases if you worry about it, but don't deny yourself the sound and glory of these madcap films in Blu-Ray.  The book is great.
Just a wonderful tribute to the comedic genius that is Mel Brooks.  I highly recommend it.  Now will someone get Dracula: Dead and Loving It out in this format, please!",1268611200,5,607,4.769230769230769
13216,5,0767726227,"I recently purchased this set and I'm very happy with it... love the movies, and there are featurettes and more  NOT on the regular DVD set to boot! Even with a book,  and it is a particularly nice one much better than I expected, this takes up less space than this many traditionally packaged DVDs would so that complaint doesn't seem fair. The worry that many have about scratched DVDs due to their placement in sleeves is also a non-issue for me. NONE of the DVDs were scratched and I'm not clumsy enough to damage them removing them .  I also don't watch the same movie day after day after day so these things are  not going to be taken in and out over and over...but you'd really have to try and damage them.

Bottom line...I really enjoy most all of these movies a lot and its a brilliant display package and the book is really truly first class, with loads of quality color pictures and stories about the movies.  This is an exceptional collection and I ended up paying less than $10 per movie...I can't even go see a lousy new movie in a theater for $10 and these can be enjoyed for years...I feel this deserves 5 stars!",1263340800,23,1128,4.347619047619047

Mel Brooks movies are fantastic. I'm pleased to own them  and support him .",1524700800,,243,4.041666666666667
