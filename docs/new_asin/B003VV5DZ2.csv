4212208,3,B003VV5DZ2,"This DVD set is a wonder for lovers of Scotland; however it could have been so much more if they would have used something more than aerial shots. Even if they could not get out in the country in the winter, they could have shown the effects and beauty of snow in the cities, much less not showing the sights you can see year round from roads and walking around the glens and lochs, cities and towns. You miss a massive amount of visual splendor and effects by only employing aerial shots.
There is some mention of history, but again, much of interest could have been added, which also would have made a more fascinating trip to this magnificent country.",1290470400,8,654,4.458333333333333
4212209,5,B003VV5DZ2,"One reviewer mentioned the repetition.  This is probably true, but I barely noticed, as the footage is just amazing.  The photography is probably the best I have come across, and I have many many dvds of Scotland.  It is a gorgeous dvd.  I found it fascinating. The price is fantastic for such a long dvd.  I checked it out from our library, but am going to buy my own copy now.  They covered most of my favorite places.  This is a perfect trip through Scotland for those like myself, who want to 'revisit' the places they have visited in the past; or for those who can't go but want to 'armchair travel'.",1288051200,14,605,4.348214285714286

4212211,4,B003VV5DZ2,"The photography, displayed in this admirable DVD depicting Scotland, is outstanding - truly outstanding. However,it would have improved the DVD if ground shots had been employed - if only to emphasise some aspects of the marvelous country and its numerous and truly worthwhile attributes.

While the general impact of this highly worthwhile DVD is most favourable, it has to be said that constant repetition - of both script and film shots - becomes extremely wearing very shortly. An estimated 10 to 15 EXTRA minutes of film is thought to have been possible if only the producers/editors had overcome their wearisome desire to repeat so much of this DVD  - obviously, to accommodate the adaptation of the complete work into half hour segments. The 'voice-over' commentary is weak enough, without the annoyance of having so much repeated - ad nauseum!

Nevertheless, a worth while DVD showing some of the very many outstanding features of a most outstandingly beautiful country.",1284681600,4,978,5.177215189873418

8407126,3,B003VV5DZ2,"Very nice photography, but the narration and the content of two of the episodes is disappointing.  Much of the intro is repeated as this was apparently intended to be three episodes - you have to listen to and watch the lengthy intro three times, basically.  Scotland is indeed a unique geological wonder, and the craggy peaks and highlands are well described - to the detriment of the human and social aspect of traveling through Scotland.  It would have been nice if the host had taken time to visit and talk to regular folks in the many small communities along the way, but instead we are given more of a lecture about the development of Scotland physical features.  Ironic,  given the nature of the people of the highlands, that we don't get to meet them or see how they live, but we get to hear some quite zealous geologists.  If you want to see the people, the villages and towns, the pubs and hear the music, this is not the video for you.  A small glimpse of Inveraray, but not much else outside Edinburgh and Glashgow.",1371772800,5,1027,4.518918918918919
8407127,4,B003VV5DZ2,"As a Scot, I was interested to see how my country, that I know so well, could be shown in a new way. I was not disappointed. The photography is outstanding and the commentary interesting without being patronising. Vanessa is a very good guide and it is obvious that she enjoyed her mission.  The reason I knocked off one star is because I found that having to watch end titles and opening sequences for each episode was mildly annoying. Surely it could have been edited into one documentary length. Also the bonus programme ""Scotland's Winter Wonderland"" was a bit repetitive, with too much time spent on aerials over the mountains. However, I would recommend it to anyone as a very different perspective to a beautiful country.",1364947200,3,728,4.777777777777778
8407128,4,B003VV5DZ2,We very much enjoyed this DVD.. I had been there and learned about the landscape even more. She was very informative.. Wished it was longer thought..,1361232000,,149,4.769230769230769
8407129,5,B003VV5DZ2,"This captivating video was stunningly shot, and is a must for anyone seeking an introduction to the Scottish landscape. Despite being made up of ""episodes"" (and thus each segment begins with repeated material) the DVD hangs together well. We really enjoyed it.",1348531200,2,260,5.214285714285714
8407130,3,B003VV5DZ2,"My family and I are Scottish and we wanted to get a DVD that explored the whole of Scotland.  Because this one is perhaps the only series that explores Scotland from the air entirely, we bought it with great expectations.  Overall it's good, but could be a lot better.  The host of the show is a geographer and that's important to note as her primary theme and focus are on the rocks and mountains of Scotland. We anticipated that the series would include more in-depth history about the towns, castles, and major cities that the camera flies over, but this is not the case.  She does briefly touch on the history of these things through short interviews with town historians, but spends far too much time on the barren, solid rock, mountains and why she fell in love with them.  While the music is done in a modern instrumental style, the series doesn't include any Scottish music at all...historical or otherwise.  This tends to rob the scenes of the magnetic quality that normally draws the viewer into the culture of the country as well as it's scenery.  Even the simple playing of the pipes that's done so well in Braveheart is never heard once in the entire series. All in all there was so much of Scotland that was left out of this video, that it leaves one rather deflated.  I would recommend checking it out from the library, or renting it (if available) instead of buying it.  It's one of those watch it once videos.",1348444800,6,1426,4.5390625
