8140845,5,B000HRMEQY,"This film was well done.  It is more like a documentary, but I really liked the way the action was going on while the narrators were among them, sometimes even interacting with them.  There were some confusing moments, for example, they seemed to stress that the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus was little known.  Every Christian knows that they were cousins.  It would have made more sense to explore what kind of relationship they may have had before John began his ministry.  Hayati Akbas, was the first actor to play Jesus that made me think perhaps this is what Jesus may have looked like.  He seemed gentle but very animated, enthusiastic, and he wasn't 'Hollywood handsome' as is the fashion in most religious films, but rather pleasant and healthy.  Also learning about the way the Last Supper may have actually have happened, and understanding how incredibly dirt poor Jesus was made so much of his teachings clearer. There were some inaccuracies and some guessing, but overall the film made me think and question, and that I think is what helps us, as Christians, to deepen our faith.  Well worth adding this to your library.",1488499200,,1151,4.836734693877551
8140846,5,B000HRMEQY,"I was so glad to find this series on Amazon. These shows were originally on television (maybe Discover Channel or History Channel?) and I was addicted.  I'm a Christian and I love the science side of the program.  The people interviewed are from different religions and have different beliefs which makes it so much more interesting.  The program could make you question your beliefs a bit but I found that I started to appreciate my ""faith"" in my beliefs even more (hope that makes sense). The acting and scenes are well done and it really puts you into Biblical times.  I've shared this series with a few friends and everyone has loved them.",1377820800,,643,4.663716814159292
8140847,5,B000HRMEQY,"I rented this series and liked it so much that I bought my own copy.  One of the important things these programs expose is that much of what people believe about certain events in the New Testament is based less on what the Bible says and more on what people have seen portrayed in Renaissance paintings.  This series helps Bible students get back on track with a practical view of life in the Holy Land 2,000 years ago as shown through archaeological evidence and other scientific disciplines.  You will get a better understanding of the Nativity story, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion and other events as myth is separated from practical reality.  Provocative, informative viewing for both devout Christians and non-believers alike, it made me feel like I was actually there, witnessing these events as they were taking place.",1348963200,,829,4.942446043165468

8140849,1,B000HRMEQY,"Keep in mind that the main contributors in this film is the people from the Jesus Seminar, who are a self-appointed group of so called ""scholars"".  Some are atheists and some are hardly scholars (one is a filmmaker).

The group's founder is an atheist called Robert Funk.  The way they establish what Jesus said and didn't say/do is by a majority vote using colored marbles.

One member, John Dominic Crossan claims that Jesus was buried in a shallow grave, dug up by dogs and eaten!

The entire production has a premise of debunking the Bible, fine debunk it all you want, but bring TRUE evidence if you can, not this non-sense from the Jesus seminar. Enough said.",1195689600,24,665,4.64957264957265
