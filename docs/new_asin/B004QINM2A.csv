8438156,5,B004QINM2A,love this DVD foREVer,1408492800,,21,4.5
8438157,2,B004QINM2A,"The name was spelled wrong on the DVD ""Avenge Sevenfold"". Sound and picture quality sucked. Music that accompanied sucked. Didn't play any Avenged Sevenfold music or interview the band and the people they did interview, they didn't say who they were. Do not spend your money on this dvd! Buy the ""All Axcess"" dvd instead.",1331510400,,321,4.8545454545454545
8438158,3,B004QINM2A,"I was hoping this DVD had some older concert footage however it is basically all documentary of the band thus far with ""The Rev"" still alive and in the band's future when it was all taken away just like that. RIP ""Rev"" the best up and coming drummer in hard Rock/Metal.",1329004800,,269,4.294117647058823
8438159,1,B004QINM2A,I am embarrassed I paid even a penny for this. Don't waste your money. No interviews with the band. No music from the band. Just interviews with three unnamed wanna-bees.,1312848000,14,170,4.7
8438160,1,B004QINM2A,"I was very disapointed with the DVD, the image and sound quality are very poor, the interviews are useless. The one and only DVD you should buy is the ""All Excess"" .",1311292800,12,165,4.1875
8438161,1,B004QINM2A,"Got some insight of the new dvd of Avenge Sevenfold: The Metal Kings (spelled this way) is not worth the money. Not only the people spelled the bands name wrong its just a educational version of the bands life with photos and non audio videos of their shows, there is no interviews of the any of the bands mates it looks like some high school kid did this on his computer. it's not even sponsored by the band's label. I am a huge fan of Avenged Sevenfold but this dvd just disappointed me...Does the band's manager know about this???",1311120000,7,533,4.393939393939394
8438162,2,B004QINM2A,"dude my copy said ""Avenge"" instead of ""Avenged""..for the first few weeks since its release it hasn't changed until now..any way..get ALL Excess..even tho it was only made prior City Of Evil and before Self Titled Album, it sure as hell explains alot more of the band than this does..its almost like a lil 6th grade kid made this for a video project or something..so if your a true a7x fan..dont bother..i doubt this was even approved by a7x anyway",1307232000,16,447,4.6
8438163,3,B004QINM2A,"The band name being spelled wrong on the cover should say enough. this isn't a very good dvd. just go buy live at the lbc and all excess instead

* i see they've fixed the picture of the cover and spelled Avenged right. My copy says ""Avenge Sevenfold"" though",1305936000,7,258,4.26530612244898
