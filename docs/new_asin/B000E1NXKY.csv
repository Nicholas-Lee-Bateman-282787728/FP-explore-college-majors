2480392,4,B000E1NXKY,"I had the opportunity to see this film at it's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival with the added bonus of the ""cast"" and director present for Q&A following the film and that might be part of why I learned so much from the film. These are real people who challenged our society's idea of family, with at least some success for a period of time. I don't think we'll be seeing many more triads of this type emerging, but the honesty in the filmaking and of the family was incredible. I found myself feeling somewhat like I was reading someone's diary (such a personal look at a relationship). The people in the film allowed the camera to follow them even when things got difficult, showing the complexity of relationships in general and the many ways that they can change.

The film challenges us to be open minded and not prejudge people because of their choices and whether a relationship works or not, there is value to be learned from the experience.",1141948800,2,968,4.595375722543353
2480393,4,B000E1NXKY,"A completely enjoyable night at the movie theater. What I love most about any movie- so strong in Three of Hearts, is when the characters, in this case real life people, have qualities that make you fall in love with them and really care about them and what happens to their lives. Three of Hearts documents the lives of three delightful people who perhaps thought ""they"" were unique enough to live in an alternative family situation and find in the end, even they, could not hold it all together the way they thought they could. What i loved most was that it hardly mattered who was gay and who was straight-and Three of Hearts-just like Brokeback and Transamerica, was about relationships and relating only this time between a threesome. I loved that the sex was NOT the focus of the film or it could have been just an opportunity for many to ""take a peek"" just to see that aspect. For anyone who is solely interested in exploring the basic human need to love and be loved...and all it's complications trying to maintain the love we finally find......go see Three of Hearts.

It will warm yours!!!!",1141948800,2,1100,4.612244897959184
2480394,4,B000E1NXKY,"Life, love, marriage, sex, children, experimentation. Saw this film st the New York festival. I think of myself as an open minded, liberal heterosexual with broad experience. This flick was an eye opener. Life is not an exact science and experimentaion can lead to breakthroughs or failure or something in between. This is a wonderful spectacle showing that really nice well meaning people can get themselves into situations that are alternately exiting, scarey, enlightening, promising and doomed all at the same time. I loved it and realized that I don't know everything. It taught me to have an open mind.",1141948800,3,608,5.09
2480395,1,B000E1NXKY,"I saw this film at the Miami International Film Festival in March of 2005 and found myslef leaving the theatre feeling quite angry.  i thought this was one of the most manipulative, dishonest excuses for a ""documentary"" I had ever seen.  It painted an unconvincing picture of two happily married gay men who together decide something in missing in their otherwise happy relationship, so they invite a third person, a woman, to join them.

Through much of the newly configured triangular relationship it seems as if everything is fine in a ridiculously ""Leave It To Beaver"" sort of way.  But, quite unexpectedly (or so it seems), one of the two gay men decides he has had enough and suddenly leaves the relationship.  He offers no explanations, and he is quite nasty in his treatment of the other two.  His leaving was my ""aha"" moment in the film because I never bought the work's central premise of everyone being so blissfully happy.  I didn't believe it in the beginning of the story when just the two men were together, and I certainly didn't buy it when the woman entered the picture.  I felt these were three of the most self-deluded people I had ever seen (particularly the balding man and the woman).  In fact, the man who eventually left the relationship struck me as the healthiest one in the bunch.  At least, in time, he realized that the ideal life he was told they were living was a bill of goods.

This is really poor filmmaking in my opinion because the filmmaker failed to interrogate the realities of the characters lives - she took the lazy way out and simply went along for the ride!",1139443200,5,1602,4.605633802816901
2480416,5,B000E1NXKY,Ever feel like you need another parent in your family? Well they tried it. This is a film for our time which examines the personal aspects and the broader socio-political aspects of family living. It re-defines what makes-up a family. It is basically a well made film about human relationships which reflects upon our own lives and our family.,1142294400,,343,4.830508474576271
2480417,5,B000E1NXKY,"THREE OF HEARTS is a wonderful film.  I went in expecting to be slightly titillated by the notion of 3 people living together.  What I found was much more profound.  Despite the unconventionality of their living situation, the threesome dealt with the same relationship problems that all couples go through.  The core of the film is about love and commitment and parenting and trying to make a connection in this world.  THREE OF HEARTS could have been a freak show - instead, it's a meditation on relationships in a modern world.  I was especially impressed by the way the film was crafted. The credits say Toby Shimin was the editor - I will now make it a point to watch all her films - she clearly knows what she's doing.",1142294400,3,724,4.530769230769231
2480418,4,B000E1NXKY,"I was immediately struck by the familiarity to this relationship.  They had the same struggles, hopes and fears as anyone of my friends, gay or straight.  I identified with all of their triumphs and tribulations.  I went into this moving completely dumbfounded by how this trio could work, I walked away realizing it was no different than any other love story.  Absolutely worth the ride.",1142208000,,388,4.923076923076923
2480419,5,B000E1NXKY,"A wonderful story of three people making very difficult decisions about life with each other. A really well made film in that it cast no judgement on what the characters were choosing - it just layed it all out and let you, as the viewer, feel whatever you were feeling. Tormented characters, but very honest filmaking.

Great Film - Highly recommend!",1142208000,,351,4.754098360655738
2480420,5,B000E1NXKY,"I was able to see this film in Denver in December, 2005. I have always said that we are all the same and that love is love, no matter who you are. This film shares that message  with us. Regardless of what your own personal beliefs are about love and sexuality, these three people show that no matter what kind of relationship one has, it takes hard work and perserverance to make it successful and even then it doesn't always last. There is love, lust, compromise, frustration, secrets, joy, fear, doubt, bliss that boil in our hearts when we choose to partake in relationships with others and the subjects of this film go through all of this and more in front of the cameras.

I think it took a lot of courage on the part of Sam, Steven and Samantha to share their stories with the greater public. They show that the human experience is beautiful and heartbreaking and yet we still decide to participate in it. Kudos to them for taking a chance, living life and continuing to look forward.

I appreciate that the film crew followed them for so long so that viewers were able to see the whole story. We see the cycle of love and partnership and all that comes with that.

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM!!!!",1142121600,3,1211,4.441441441441442
2480421,5,B000E1NXKY,"I was fortunate to see this documentary showing at a film festival in Silver Spring, MD. The film was able to be serious enough to show the truths about this unique relationship with its highs and lows ... joys and difficulties but also able to be extemely entertaining and funny. Well done!",1142035200,,291,4.615384615384615
2480422,5,B000E1NXKY,"What a revelation!  In the hands of director Susan Kaplan, the story of Sam, Steven, and Samantha becomes a surprising and compassionate look at a relationship which will turn your conventional notion of family upside dowm.  And, while it is certain to provoke lively debate, the film's strength lies not in controversy, but in its masterful capacity to turn what at first seems a marginal tale into a narrative with universal appeal.  This is documentary filmmaking at its best.",1142035200,,479,5.037974683544304
2480423,5,B000E1NXKY,"I saw this movie in Miami and was blown away by its effect on me and my boyfriend. The movie is so entertaining and thought provoking that afterward, and for at least two days, we used the movie as a Centerpiece for us to express our views on the eternal question ""How do you view marriage?"" This movie asks that question and makes you want to think about an answer. As far as production values are concerned, it is a warm-hearted movie that you have to love.",1142035200,2,459,4.287356321839081
2480424,5,B000E1NXKY,"I saw this film recently and was amazed at what the filmmakers brought to light.  It seemed to be a film about a very unusual relationship, but at its core, it was a film about people trying to navigate intimacy.  You saw that these people were basically like anyone else trying to balance love, work and family.  Their growth as people served as a neat way to end the journey we took with them.

The film moved well, with lots of humor and tension to keep you engaged in these people's lives.

I highly recommend it!",1141948800,3,517,4.34375
2480425,4,B000E1NXKY,"I saw Three of Hearts at an NYC screening and was really impressed with both the bravery of the documentary's three characters and the filmmaker's sensitivity in telling such a personal story. Threesomes may be an interesting rarity, and the film could have been exploitative, aiming for titillation and shock, but instead it's a really well-told story spanning years, covering all of the natural highs and lows of the relationship, from love and sex to finances and children.

I think in the end it shows how strikingly normal this rather unusual set-up is, and how the people in it have to deal with all of the same things people in more common partnerships do. It's also consistently funny and entertaining to watch, though its being realistic and honest about the relationship means it has its bittersweet and even uncomfortable moments as well.",1141948800,2,849,4.97887323943662

8103994,5,B000E1NXKY,I LOVED this film! It was a fascinating look at a real life threesome. I am really intrigued by relationships and how people form them and navigate them. This may not be for everyone but I loved it and will watch it again!,1446940800,,222,4.186046511627907
8103995,1,B000E1NXKY,"I bought this movie because I wanted to experience something new. I thought this was going to be like the real world, but it turned out to be a documentary about a happy threesome that went bad. Very disappointed and not my cup of tea.",1441584000,,235,4.2444444444444445
8103996,5,B000E1NXKY,This was a wonderful story. Well told. Did not pander to the sexual aspect. Informative and was used for a college project. Product was a good price and quality.,1326931200,,161,4.586206896551724
8103997,5,B000E1NXKY,"I saw this movie several years ago and still think of it from time to time. What a great, honest, heartbreaking story.",1317945600,,118,4.409090909090909
8103998,5,B000E1NXKY,"This is a beautiful movie which not only shows what open communication can do for a relationship, but also demonstrates how relationships of any strength can hit roadblocks. Love is not defined easily; this documentary proves how we even have to reconsider the idea of romantic love only existing between two people at a time. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1237680000,,351,4.966101694915254
8103999,5,B000E1NXKY,"If you are looking for a movie that lays out practical examples of healthy ways that a multi-person intimate relationship can function, this unfortunately is not that movie.

More importantly, if you're looking for a movie that lays out many practical and healthy ways that ANY relationship can function, this unfortunately is not that movie.

Why do I start by mentioning those lack of characteristics in this film?  Because I watched the movie hoping to walk away with some non-traditional relationship insights, and sadly this triad fails not because of rare problems related to being considerate of two other people;  but rather, this ""marriage"" of different individuals fails for very common reasons that many traditional relationships and marriages fail.

The film's title Three of Hearts:  A Postmodern Family is arguably misleading.  In other words, Kramer v. Kramer wasn't misleadingly titled:  Two of Hearts:  A Modern Family.  If the movie had been more forthright in its title, I think fewer viewers would have walked away from watching it feeling misled.

But setting the title aside, and examining this documentary film from other more accurate perspectives, it is an excellent film.  The soundtrack is extraordinarily good.  The film is an intimate view of a non-traditional relationship where a male homosexual couple (where both men had previous heterosexual relationships) decided to seek out and take on a third person, a woman, to form a triad family.

The film works as a close examination of relationship & personality patterns & priorities that don't work in most relationships, not just patterns that didn't work in their triad.  The film is about balancing partners' interests and finding common solutions.  It is also about being unable to balance partners' interests and unable to find common solutions.

I would like to write this review from an omnipotent viewpoint and to tell you, ""The relationships failed because person A didn't _____ (fill in the blank).  And person B didn't _____ (fill in the blank) . . .""  But even though I can make reasonable observations and inferences from the great deal of detailed documentary footage, the carefully chosen written and spoken words of the individuals, and the immense amount of visual and demeanor evidence, there is still years, hours, days, and events we don't see on camera.  So, I don't have enough information to say with confidence all the reasons (or the primary reasons) the relationships changed.  But I can speak to the information presented:

Steven, in his DVD ""Special Features"" (words he wrote for the filmmakers to use as ""Family Updates"" after the film was shot) says the following:  ""I have stopped worrying about what others think about my opinion and actions.""  This is a very revealing statement, consistent with his in-movie inhumane inconsideration of his former partners (Sam and Samantha) and his former (and his daughter's present) pet dog.  Given that Steven was given plenty of time to write anything, and as much as he would like, it's telling the few words he carefully chose.  He continues, ""I am passionate about living life true to myself . . . I have a partner who has allowed me to really experience the meaning of unconditional love . . . I am blessed to have found someone (new) who . . . supports me in being the most powerful person I can be.""

Steven, during the film, is offended when others won't recognize his triad.  Steven, during the film, thinks in terms of: If push comes to shove between person A and person B, then I'll choose one over the other.  Steven, in his work and social life wants to have the power to decide what he and his partner(s) do.  Instead of seeking what might be best for each person in the relationship, considering each person's interests equally, he wants the deciding vote regardless of the others' considerations.

It's fitting that Steven ends up in a more traditional relationship where his partner gives ""unconditional love.""  Unconditional love is one of those ""sounds like a good idea"" terms that when you really examine it, is most often deceiving and unfair at its core.  What do I mean?  I once had a person complain to me:  ""But that means she doesn't love me unconditionally.""  And I thought, without saying this aloud:  When a person wants to be loved ""unconditionally,"" they're really asking for love without accountability - and I've never personally seen that be healthy or thrive in the long term for everyone involved.  ""I want unconditional love"" is like asking for ""unconditional time"" or ""unconditional salary.""  It's usually asked for by people who want love, but don't want to do all the thought and work (the ""conditions"") that would be deserving of the amount of love they are requesting.  I've never been loved by someone who didn't make the standards of behavior & character they wanted clearly known.  And meeting those fair conditions is what has made our relationships healthy for everyone.

Steven may work better in a traditional 2 person relationship where two people broker not what is necessarily equally good or best for both, but rather they broker a cease fire and a power-sharing arrangement they can both agree to as a compromise.  Many marriages last not because the arrangement is best for both, but rather because in the vacuum of only two people, one person agrees to subordinate their wants (or conditions) to the wants of the other person.  Steven at the end of the film appears to achieve a relationship where he has the power he wants, with ""unconditional love"" so he is allowed to do things his way, not ""worrying about what others think"" and ""true"" to himself.  I suspect in a healthy triad, each person will benefit by NOT trying to obtain decisive power and will benefit by NOT seeking love without considerate conditions.

The movie sadly ends up not being a beautiful example of people considering the needs of each person equally in a relationship.  Rather, it is a movie about individuals failing to find ways to meet the needs of ALL their other family members.  But the documentary filmmakers cannot be critiqued for the character decisions of their documentary subjects.  That would be like critiquing ""Hoop Dreams"" for all the poor career and social decisions the young ball players made.  The documentary is beautifully arranged, ordered, and edited.

Sam and Samantha, I am sorry for your loss, and I support your continued co-parenting.  Steven, my hope is that you will someday have better knowledge of the important reasons to become more socially kind and considerate of the people who have been intimate with you, supported you, and depended on you.",1192752000,11,6665,4.963931469792606
8104000,5,B000E1NXKY,"This documentary was on cable and I accidently tuned in after it had started. I was riveted from the beginning because the relationship between the three people was so unusual, yet they obviously cared very much about one another. There was never a dull moment in the film, it was all very fascinating but it ended sadly. I felt very sorry for the children and I thought the adults were selfish for bringing them into a relationship like that. I'm all for adult freedom but not when it compromises the lives of children. I would recommend this film to others most definitely. It is definitely a human interest story.",1188604800,,616,4.660550458715596
8104001,5,B000E1NXKY,"This film was a real, touching and beautiful look into an unusual, unconventional relationship, which pointed out the dynamics inherent in every relationship.  Anyone who is in a relationship, or even in a human body for that matter, should take the opportunity to watch this heart-felt film. I expected to go see some random thing in which a old friend of mine had a creative hand, and found myself deeply touched, with my breath taken away.  It is artfully and skillfully directed and produced, and stayed with me long after i left the theatre, and is with me even now.",1146787200,4,571,4.7
