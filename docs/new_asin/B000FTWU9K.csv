2589586,5,B000FTWU9K,"A great movie. a simple story about man's inability to accept nature and human's psychotic quest for domination and extermination of what they don't accept as part of nature. Some morality element is involved - a satisfactory ending. An interesting role by a youthful Dennis Waterman.
Great he is and steals the show - a brilliant performance!!!",1305331200,3,345,5.0701754385964914
2589647,5,B000FTWU9K,"I was unsure about the negative possibilities that could be included in this story; however the story is well worth watching.  I, in the capacity of a naturalist, needed to rescue a red fox.  This movie is indeed a realistic representation of the very intelligent and delightful behavior of the Red Fox.  It  does not sentimentalize the fox and shows life in the wild, life on the edge of civilization, and the tenderhearted commitment of this quick witted clown.  I loved the camera work and the efforts to reproduce a realistic story.",1457136000,,536,4.782608695652174
2589648,1,B000FTWU9K,I could not watch this movie.  The first scene showed two men with shovels and 3 foxhounds.  The human animals then saw a fox den with a terrified Momma fox and her babies.  They turned the dogs loose.  The carnage didn't end there.  I turned off the movie and the horrible memory will stay with me for a long time.,1455580800,,315,4.183333333333334
2589649,3,B000FTWU9K,"Animal lover that I am, I enjoyed this movie, not knowing anything at all about fox hunting, It was interesting to see what ""the hunt"" involves.",1441065600,,144,4.576923076923077

2589653,4,B000FTWU9K,"good movie although somewhat sad. Shows the friendship of a fox and foxhound
Ashton saves the fox cub then has to face hunting him as an adult",1398297600,,142,4.296296296296297
2589654,5,B000FTWU9K,"This is a very sad, but beautiful story. Heartbreaking, but uplifting. Fine performances all around. The film is not pedantic, or sugar-coated regarding the hunt. I hate hunting, and I love this film. The soundtrack is hauntingly lovely, as well.",1394841600,,246,5.175
2589655,4,B000FTWU9K,"This movie is about the ways of fox hunting in England. It starts out when a man named Tod finds a fox cub among his dead mother and litter mates, and Tod takes him to a fox hunter to care for. The fox cub is raised with a litter of fox hounds where the fox (named Tag) becomes close friends with a young hound as they grew up together. When Tag grew older, the fox hunter chased Tag away into the wild. Soon, Tag becomes another fox caught up in a hunt. But Tag's hound friend wants no part of it, and the two remain friends, even during the hunts. But when the hunter who took care of Tag really wants him dead, Tag's trust in the hunter puts him in danger. At some points, this movie may be hard to watch. It really shows what fox hunting was in England, which thankfully now has been band.",1363132800,,793,4.057324840764331
2589656,4,B000FTWU9K,"Lovely, very dated of course, film.  Makes you wonder what sort of people these are who obviously have money and spend time at such a gruesome sport.  I like films from this era and for the time it was well made and filmed.",1358640000,,223,4.162790697674419

8126764,4,B000FTWU9K,Very good but not really for kids. Thank goodness the Brits have stopped fox hunting . It's a cruel sport.,1495411200,,106,4.35
8126765,5,B000FTWU9K,I loved this film. Came back to watch it again and I'm very sad its no longer available in my area. Its a great representation of the wonderful sport of fox hunting and the intelligence of the quarry.,1492905600,,200,4.2894736842105265
8126766,5,B000FTWU9K,A wonderful story for the entire family.,1489449600,,40,4.857142857142857
8126767,5,B000FTWU9K,"I first saw this film as a kid and I loved it. I love animals and I loved the story!  I watched Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom so I guess I could handle the content of this movie as a kid. In fact I watched it a few years ago and I actually had forgotten about those brutal parts of the movie, I guess I only remembered the good stuff.  35+ years after I first watched it, I named my Basset Hound ""Merlin"" after the hound in this movie!",1477699200,,436,3.8876404494382024
8126768,5,B000FTWU9K,"If you are not familiar with the way things were done back in the 70s don't watch this. The fact is that foxes were/are varmits in England and do a great deal of killing of small livestock on farms where people are trying to make a living - the hard way. The farmers needed to control them. They still do, but times have changed. In fact rather than hunting them with hounds you can just shoot them. Foxhunting employed many people from hound care, horse care and training, and all supporting staff.  If you're interested in foxhunting its a great movie but don't be too judgemental. Its not the whole picture. I do think the opening scene is a bit of a brutal way to start but I think its a wonderful film if you understand.",1472860800,,725,4.330882352941177
