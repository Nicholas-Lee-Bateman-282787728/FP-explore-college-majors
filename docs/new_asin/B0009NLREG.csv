8063524,5,B0009NLREG,"This is without a doubt the best work out tape I've ever owned. I've just ordered my second copy because I've completely worn out the first! Jeff Gibson has a wonderful way of combining hard work and exercise with humor and fun! He covers it all on this tape - cardio, arms, legs and gluts and he'll have you laughing all the way through the end! What a wonderful way to start the day...with exercise, humor, and a prayer at the end. I highly recommend this product.",1279324800,,466,4.367816091954023
