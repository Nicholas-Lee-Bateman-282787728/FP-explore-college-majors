8229166,1,B000XPZTLW,"This is a movie built around one man's agenda against the LDS church. If you have questions about Mormons, go to the source. This is a waste of time and energy.",1511049600,,160,4.193548387096774
8229167,1,B000XPZTLW,Author is dilusional. This book is based on a tiny amount of truth and a whole lot of myth and speculation. Anyone concerned about this subject should go directly to LDS sources and check it out for themselves.,1506384000,3,210,4.552631578947368
8229168,1,B000XPZTLW,This is a work of fiction from an ill informed individual with a cleat agenda. In a time when the world is struggling with a liberal moral secularism directing an illinformed opinion at one religion when all religion is under atack is irresponsible and short sighted. This just proves any person can publish any dribble and call it literature.,1474243200,4,343,4.830508474576271
8229169,1,B000XPZTLW,"A better question might be, ""What does the bible say about bearing false witness?"" I was raised being taught by ""Christians"" about what horrible Mormons believed. When I grew up, I decided to go to the source itself, trust myself & God & find out for myself. That was 30 years ago. Thank goodness I did. My life has been richly blessed beyond my wildest dreams. Nothing I was taught was remotely true. Only twisted, part truths taken out of context.",1452384000,9,449,4.555555555555555
