8222866,5,B000WE3PE2,Louie knows how to get a point across to the human soul,1448236800,,55,3.6666666666666665
8222867,5,B000WE3PE2,This is aptly titled because you can't really describe the universe.  It's too vast and astounding for our little minds to grasp.  But this video gives you a tiny foothold into something absolutely astounding!,1344470400,,209,5.117647058823529
8222868,5,B000WE3PE2,"I have watched this DVD a few times and it is just awesome!  He really pulls you in and makes you realize just how HUGE God is and how crazy in-love with you God is!  I see he has a newer version of this DVD (2009?) so that one is probably even better, I'll have to get the newer one and watch it myself!  He explains how God and his vast Creation really is absolutely INDESCRIBABLE!  He taught me stuff about astronomy and the universe that I didn't know!",1314662400,,456,4.089887640449438
8222869,4,B000WE3PE2,"I liked this too but I was looking forward to see a diff one (the one I saw from Church which is by Louie Giglio also)but overall, this is great.  Very educational and it teaches every viewer that ""there is God!"" whether you belive it or not...",1252540800,,244,4.191489361702128
8222870,5,B000WE3PE2,"it is amazingly interesting. worth every second of your time. this is part one. after this tour, L. Giglio found some more incredible examples and outdid this DVD with the one called ""how great is our God"". if you are at low point in your life it is better to see part 2 (how great is our God) and then see this one. on both of them you get a real perspective how unfathomable God is, and how small we are; yet, how special we are to him.",1207526400,2,438,3.9886363636363638
8222871,5,B000WE3PE2,This is just as it says; Indescribable!  It is an awesome presentation by an incredible and gifted speaker on just how AWESOME/INDESCRIBABLE our God is.,1200182400,5,152,5.08
