8713533,3,B00WHZZ8HG,Liked the first couple of seasons but by the fourth I got aggravated with the story it kept going off into different tangents and I couldn't even finish it.,1503964800,,156,4.413793103448276
8713534,4,B00WHZZ8HG,"Very good seller (arrived sonner to overseas), but the bluray wasn't very protected (two plastic things broken), the image quality of this remaster is okay but not so great but the anime is 9years old ! Anyway, the price is good for the number of episodes and I am happy with this transaction",1471478400,,292,4.528301886792453
8713535,5,B00WHZZ8HG,"Package arrived promptly, as described, and in great condition. Thanks!",1467590400,,71,6.2
8713536,3,B00WHZZ8HG,"Just received it from crunchyroll.com and if you have the Bandai Entertainment DVD version do not get this one it is the edited version
from the TV not uncensored DVD video version the constant ""bleeps"" are annoying and the video quality is standard good not great for blu-ray
is acceptable at best again if you have the Bandai version do not bother to upgrade to BD kudos to section 23 for the release but the should have gotten uncensored version.",1439683200,13,449,4.625
