1675153,5,B00005Y772,"There is a large group of people who lavish anime (japanimation)with praise for it's simplistic and stylized look. They must have never seen 'Batman: The Animated Series.' Bruce Timm's emmy-award winning art design and production, creates a sleek, timeless retro-modern look for Gotham City and it's inhabitants. A century from now, this will still look as classy and modern as it does now. This, matched with an incredible writing team headed by Paul Dini and spot-on voice talent including Mark Hamill as the Joker, secures this as the best animated series ever. Yes, even better than 'The Simpsons.'
Warner Bros. has had a poor commitment to TV on DVD. Up until now, everything they've released has been ""Best of"" compilations. While 'Batman: TAS' isn't being released in seasonal box sets as I'd hoped, it's the first series that Warner Bros. is releasing cronologically (by production order.)
If your a fan of comics, animation, film noir, or a really good mystery, you owe it to yourself to pick this up when it streets in April.",1015027200,6,1035,4.954022988505747

1675155,4,B00005Y772,"It's about time that Warner Brothers finally responded to the years of demand by the fans to release the amazing ""Batman: The Animated Series"" on DVD.  What we've finally gotten is a mixed bag, however.  I'm happy to see this first disc of episodes in chronological order (rather than the ridiculous themed releases like what we got on VHS), and hopefully Warner will continue to release the entire series in order and complete; but more episodes on the disc would have been nice!  What we get here on this release called ""Batman: The Legend Begins"" is the first five episodes of the animated series -- based on production order, not airdate order -- (1) ""On Leather Wings"", (2) ""Christmas with the Joker"", (3) ""Nothing to Fear"", (4) ""The Last Laugh"", and (5) ""Pretty Poison"".  Respectively, these episodes are the spectacular pilot with Man-Bat, a lighthearted Joker story, a pretty good Scarecrow story, another (slightly better) Joker story and the origin story of Poison Ivy.  A pretty good introduction to the series, but the best was yet to come!  As far as extras go, there isn't much.  An introduction by Bruce Timm, a few webgames and CD-ROM links, and a brief documentary.  (Where are the commentaries, pre-production drawings, artwork slideshows, and extended documentaries?) ... ...  Now, if you've never seen the series you are in for a treat!  ""Batman: The Animated Series"" premiered on television way back on Sep. 5th, 1992 with the episode ""The Cat & The Claw, part 1"" (not included on this first disc), about three months after the live-action ""Batman Returns"" had come out.  The animated series (unlike the mediocre movies) met with almost universal acclaim.  Boistered by fabulous writing from the likes of Paul Dini, Alan Burnett, Michael Reaves and many others, as well as solid voice talent like Mark Hamill (wonderful as the Joker) and Kevin Conroy (this guy IS Batman), the series also intoduced such wonderful characters as Harley Quinn and improved versions of nearly ever Batman rogues gallery villian.  In my humble opinion, the animated series is the definitive Batman, better than any of the comic books or movies... absolutely nailing the characterizations of Batman/Bruce Wayne himself, as well as his relationships with police commissioner Gordon, Robin/Dick Grayson and best of all Alfred.  The series transcends its origins as a ""kids cartoon"" to being one of the greatest and most adult animated series ever produced.  (In a recent poll, it ended second only to ""The Simpsons"" as the greatest cartoon series ever.) ...  At a rate of only five episodes per disc, it will take twenty-two discs to release the entire series of 109 episodes, and that doesn't even count the 50+ episodes of ""Batman Beyond"" or the 54 episodes of the ""Superman"" animated series; these series have not yet been announced, but we can only hope... right, Warner Bros?",1011398400,172,2877,5.0

1675180,5,B00005Y772,"Batman - The Animated Series is one of the best animation shows that aired during the 90s. This DVD provides the first 5 episodes of the First Season.  I have listed my reviews for the episodes separately, followed by my review of the DVD.

Review of the Episodes:

1. On Leather Wings: A winged bat-like creature is spotted flying above Gotham, stealing chemicals from various pharmaceuticals (recently from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, where it also injured a night watchman). The Police suspect that it is Batman. To clear his name, Batman goes to the scene of the crime and finds a tape along with a strand of the creature's hair. Having his suspicions, he goes to Dr. March and Dr. Langstrom to ask their opinion on the evidence. However, since the Doctors give him a faulty explanation, Batman is convinced that one of them is the cause for the crimes. Can Batman find out who Man-Bat is and get him in time?

A good start to the series, we get to see how Batman clears his name by going after the Man-Bat. (4/5).

2. Christmas with the Joker - The Joker has escaped from Gotham Asylum during Christmas time. Meanwhile, Dick convinces Bruce to watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to let Bruce get into the holiday spirit. However, the Joker makes all the channels broadcast to his show called ""Christmas with the Joker"", where he intends to share his Christmas `joy' with the citizens of Gotham. It is up to Batman and Robin to save the people of Gotham while Joker holds Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock, and reporter Summer Gleeson hostage.

This is a little different, but still a good episode where we get to see Batman and Robin in action. The highlights of this show are the scenes where Batman and Robin save the people on the train and when they go to the Laffco Toy Factory to defeat Joker. (4/5).

3. Nothing to Fear - A new villain called the `Scarecrow' is stealing and vandalizing the University. However, the Scarecrow's intention of robbing the University is not for the money, but for revenge (especially on Dr. Long, the head of the University). It is up to Batman to catch the crook, but will he be able to succeed, knowing that the Scarecrow is making Batman live his darkest fears?

This was another great episode where we get to see Batman confront his darkest fears while trying to catch the Scarecrow, who is putting fear on the citizens of Gotham. (5/5).

4. The Last Laugh - It's April Fools Day and the Joker is back to spread havoc on Gotham. He spreads a laughing gas through the city, and people who inhale it start laughing until they become insane. Once again, Batman has to stop the Joker, but as usual the Joker has new tricks up his sleeve.

I loved this episode because it was purely action-based, and kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. The scenes where Batman is trapped underwater, or where he is trying to defeat ""Captain Clown"" is terrific! (5/5).

5. Pretty Poison - An area of exotic wildflowers is being removed to build the Gotham Penitentiary. There is a woman who is against the destruction of these flowers, and wants to make sure that Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent pay for their crime, as it was them who initiated the project.

The first episode with Poison Ivy in it, this was a good episode, but was a little slow and predictable. It was nevertheless fun to watch Batman fight a female villain for a change. (3.5/5).

Review of the DVD:

Since the official Season Boxed Sets of ""Batman - The Animated Series"" is now available, it is rather pointless to buy this DVD when you can buy the complete sets with more extras included in them. However, it you are a fan of the show, you can still purchase this DVD, as it contains wonderful episodes containing The Joker, Poison Ivy, and The Scarecrow, to add to your collection. Otherwise, it is better to buy all the 3 Volumes of Batman which contain all the episodes of the entire series, instead of this.",1119484800,13,3908,4.572246065808297
1675181,5,B00005Y772,"Batman: The Animated Series came out while I was in college, which gave me lots of time to watch it.  This DVD includes the first five episodes, with such greats as the Joker, Scarecrow and Poison Ivy.  Lets face it, ""Christmas with The Joker"" might be old when compared to the newer episodes, but it is a classic.
The best part is the series can draw on the vast background and the large selection of characters from the comic books and other sources.  This would allow the series to develop story arches, use its own history and even shoot out a few full-length movies.
The DVD has great extras, such as how to draw Batman, conversations with Director Bruce Timm about each episode and a 'Life on the Edge Game'. Even the DVD menus are cool.  Good for any fan of the Batman!",1080345600,5,776,4.405594405594406

1675194,5,B00005Y772,"I just bought this DVD today, after reading a few negative reviews on amazon.com.  Although I too would love to see them release a box set of this classic animated series, I believe there are two ways to look at it.  ... And these five episodes are great stuff!  There's only so much one needs to do to decorate such a great series--the episodes speak for themselves.  This is Batman at his finest.  Keep 'em coming, WB!  I'm eager for more!",1050537600,3,441,4.382716049382716
1675195,4,B00005Y772,"A good start to producing the animated series on Dvd. But, this needs a lot more extras. Extra episodes, extra extras, like deleted scenes, watching the actors rehearse, or reading the scripts would be fun, interviews with the cast, and, since this is for kids :) maybe a few dvd-rom games.
There's just so much more they could do with these DVDs. I'd like to see them take advantage of the opportunities.
Kevin Conroy is awesome. He IS Batman. The artwork is near flawless. I am so drawn into the entire ambience, that I have to catch myself, remembering this is a cartoon. It's not live action. Which, after the dismal Batman & Robin, it's very easy to understand why the animated series seems like live characters, and Batman & Robin seemed more cartoony than the animated series.
Despite the shortage of episodes and extras, I still give this 4 out of 5 stars, or a 92 of 100.",1045180800,,880,4.540880503144654
1675196,3,B00005Y772,"It is about time that WB came out with some of the animated series!  The stories are among the best tales of the Dark Knight!  The DVD extras however leave ALOT to be desired.  The game that is on there is a joke, and the only bigger joke is the ""how to draw batman segment"" which was horrible.
Despite the DVD extra ""jokes"" that are on there, I would say that this is a must for any bat-fan.",1025827200,3,392,4.0
1675197,4,B00005Y772,The episodes on this dvd are pretty good. They don't reach the greatness that the series does later on but they're a good start. I enjoyed the interviews but the games are pointless and that space should have been used for another episode. I hope this dvd sells enough for them to warrant releasing the others on dvd. This time they should put a whole lot more episodes on the set. I definately recommend this dvd as it's a great start to a great series.,1024963200,,454,4.352941176470588
1675198,5,B00005Y772,"The only thing not to love about the animated Batman series is the choppy animation, itself.  Everything else is stellar.  Bruce Timm's artwork deliberately hearkens back to the 1940's Max Fleischer Superman shorts, and the clever stories appeal to the kids but are sophisticated enough to hold the attention of adults.
The best thing about the entire series is the ""kinder, gentler"" approach to the caped superhero.  As opposed to Tim Burton's dark just-this-side-of-a-psycho interpretation, the animated Batman develops something of a rapport with his adversaries.  He comes to understand them before even attempting to bring them in, and he tries the easy approach first  -  granted, it generally fails, but at least he tries.  His defeat of Gotham's various criminals is invariably brought about by Batman's psychological understanding of them.
The next best thing is the new interpretation of old villains, and the introduction of several Bob Kane originals who never saw screen time anywhere.  In the latter category, the Scarecrow and Poison Ivy are magnificent.  The Scarecrow story on this DVD introduced Scarecrow as Kane did  -  as an inadequate little man who uses his advanced knowledge of chemistry to incapacitate his opponents with fear, making himself feel bigger by comparison.  Beginning as a mere bankrobber, later stories saw him evolve into a more psychotic extortionist.  Poison Ivy, who Kane introduced but rarely used (if I'm not mistaken, he actually only had her in a single story)  -  and who didn't appear often in post-Kane comics, either  -  is given a complete makeover and a credible psychosis of her own.  Her introductory story is one of the best in the animated series, and is present in this collection.  Similarly, ""Manbat,"" a potentially silly figure, is given adult character and motivation in this series, even if he is largely a Dr. Jekyll knockoff.
The greatest  -  and most pleasant  -  surprise is Mark Hamill's Joker, which is as perfect a vocal interpretation as anyone could ask for.  The Joker of the animated series is the closest anyone has come to the original Kane version, the best and the most satisfying.  ""Christmas With the Joker"" is an episode made mostly for the kids, though adults will probably enjoy it too  -  it's one of the few that goes really over the top and indulges itself a bit in juvenile comic-strip-ism.  Joker's other story, his introductory piece, is much better, both more frightening and more humorous  -  which is the way the Joker really should be.
Don't worry about buying this one, if you don't have kids as an excuse.  Adults will enjoy these great Batman stories probably even more than the kids.  Trust me, if you love Batman, the animated series was the best he ever got, outside of the comic book itself.
Indulge yourself!",1022889600,6,2810,4.976344086021506
1675199,5,B00005Y772,If you want to see the definative version of Batman; look no further.  In this volume you get to see the first five episodes of the animated series.  You get to see the first Joker episode all in DVD quality sound and color.  No commercials. If you are listening Warner Brothers...make the complete first season available to fans.  This series deserves special treatment!,1021766400,,371,4.841269841269841

1675201,4,B00005Y772,"There's no doubt about it.  This animated series, which was made after the success of the Tim Burton BATMAN films, is regarded by many as the definititive version of the Dark Knight.  This DVD contains the first 5 episodes which were produced.  Included are 2 episodes featuring Batman's archfoe, the Joker, as well as adventures which introduce the monsterous Man-Bat, the sinister Scarecrow, and the deadly Poison Ivy.  Unlike the live-action movies, this series is intelligently plotted and brimming with character depth and motivation.  Also, the wonderful music and dark art-deco design (a cross between the 30's and Gothic styles)provides wonderful richness to the whole thing. The voice acting throughout the series is especially top-notch.  Kevin Conroy is perfect as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Mark Hamill, who replaced Tim Curry, shines as the insane Joker. While the DVD is somewhat skimpy on the extras, this is still a series that respects its audience....both young and old alike. Highly recommended for Bat-fans and fans of animation in general.",1020211200,8,1063,5.291666666666667
1675202,5,B00005Y772,I had not seen these first eposodes in years. What fun! If you are a fan this disc is a must have. It is simply the best form of Batman ever. The only down side is that they are not recorded in 5.1 Digital. I hope that Warner Brothers release the rest of the series in a quick and timely manner - Box Set?,1020124800,,305,3.78125
1675209,5,B00005Y772,"For the last few years I've been longing for a high quality DVD release of this show.  Along with the Simpsons and classic Tom and Jerry cartoons, I rank this as one of the best animated shows ever.
High quality animation, fantastic graphic design, great stories and voice acting. Combine this with a darker mature overtone that truly captures the essence of Batman, and you have a classic.
I'm so happy to see this on DVD, and at 5 episodes for [the price] I feel like I'm betting a bargain.  Could use some more special features, like artwork from the ""Art of Batman: The Animated Series"" but besides that everything is excellent.
I'm already anxious to get the next volume!",1020038400,,676,4.625
1675210,5,B00005Y772,"I fell in love with Batman with the first movie by Tim Burton. Its dark brooding and gothic feel was very interesting. The music by Danny Elfman gave the movie a special quality. After they left the series it just feel off and everything that was good about it was gone.
  Then out of nowhere came the Batman animated. A mean nasty looking dark knight in a dark Gotham city. No more neon lights. This was the Gotham city of the first film. Danny Elfman returned to do a version of the Batman theme.
  The characters are done so well. The artwork and designs are simply incredible and character voices so fit the players that it is hard to think of anyone else playing them.
  There is more deapth in the animated series than in any of the films. We get to watch Harvey Dents fall from grace. If you like Batman then it is hard to walk by this DVD. It is well worth the money. I hope they rel;ease more soon.",1020038400,,907,4.213872832369942
1675211,5,B00005Y772,"The videos' are brilliant.  First off, BTAS releases five of the first episodes in the series.
1. On Leather Wings
2. Christmas With The Joker
3. Nothing To Fear
4. The Last Laugh
5. Pretty Poison
I was starting to wonder if they would show the intro to the episodes like cartoon network did, and sure enough they did! All the episodes are excellent; I have always wondered how the artists could be so patient in drawing a very realistic building, etc. and you would only see that object for a couple of seconds.  It just tells you that these guys have a desire to draw, and enjoy it.  If you loved the ""Batman: The Animated Series"", then you'll enjoy this footage!",1019952000,,665,4.434426229508197
1675212,4,B00005Y772,"You know, there are a number of well written televisions shows out there: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Simpsons, X-Files, Angel, Friends, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, to name a few.
Who would've ever thought that an ANIMATED show would top 'em all?
This is the Dark Knight in his finest form. The movies and the past TV shows are all put to shame by this wonderfully crafted show. The animation is excellent and the writing is way above par (seriously, Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and the rest of the staff go head-to-head with Joss Whedon [Buffy] and his team in terms of writing dialogue. They are that dang good.)
So on this delightful little DVD, we are treated to the first five episodes produced:
On Leather Wings: The story is really nothing special, but the animation... oh my gosh. It is breathtaking. It's rich, it's smooth, and it really shows the capabilities of the animation team. Rating: **** (out of 5)
Christmas with the Joker: One of the more underrating episodes. Any episode featuring the Joker is a delight for fans of witty dialogue and this is no different. Again, nothing out of the ordinary, just another fun episode. Rating: ***
Nothing to Fear: Our first look at the Scarecrow. It's a rather bland episode, mainly because I find the Scarecrow at this stage to be rather bland. A typical payback-gone-wrong story. Rating: ***
The Last Laugh: Joker Episode. Excellent Dialogue.  This is another one of those Batman-chases-Joker-through-half-the-city-before-catching-him sprinkled with some great dialogue and a KILLER music track. Rating: ****
Pretty Poison: A villian with a cause. This is probably the most interesting episode on the DVD because we get to witness firsthand the origin of one of the more interesting villians, Poison Ivy. Plus, she's kind of hot (okay, so I'm a little whacked) Rating: ****
The Extras: The reason why we buy DVDs... and for the most part, they're not great. The side commentaries are interesting, but that's probably the only extra that's worthwhile. Everything else just seems like filler. This is what essentially brings the rating down to 4 stars.
The final note: Heck, it's Batman the Animated Series! That reason alone should be enough to make you go out and buy this DVD! Yeah, it's not the collection of the best episodes, but hey, we'll get to the good ones eventually. Meanwhile, this should be more than adequate to whet your appetite for future DVD releases.",1019865600,,2426,4.902676399026764
1675213,2,B00005Y772,"This includes merely the first 5 episodes in the Batman: Animated Series. The series gets better as time goes on, but having the first 5 is kind of interesting. They were just getting started here, so I thought the animation was choppy, and I enjoyed just 2 of the 5 tales, the other 3 are pretty basic plots. The extras on this disc aren't even worth mentioning, one is a mindless game for kids, the type seen in 5 dollar DVDs and the other is very brief video showing you how they draw Batman's face. I disliked the stories with Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and the Man-Bat, the other two are with the Joker and thankfully are better quality, thanks to great writing and Mark Hamill's voice talent as Joker. Hopefully, new B:TAS DVDs will be out sooner and include more for our money.",1019779200,,779,4.454545454545454
1675214,4,B00005Y772,"After months of anticipation, I finally bused to my local comic book shop yesterday on my lunch hour and grabbed this DVD along with the other new Batman titles. All I could think about all day was getting home and popping this disc into my DVD player. Batman: The Animated Series was one of the great shows of my early childhood (next to Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters) and having the first five episodes on disc is amazing. There are noticible differences between these early episodes and the ones that followed: the animation is slightly more detailed and darker, Alfred's voice actor is different, Mark Hamil still hadn't quite nailed his famous Joker voice, and the interaction between Batman and Robin has a tinge of campiness. Yet, this is still the definitive Dark Knight.
However, I'm rather sad to say this disc disappointed me. While the episodes are still great, their presentation is completely lacking. There are no chapter stops for individual episodes, like on the Batman Beyond DVD. One would think the perfect place to introduce chapter stops would be where the segements fade to black for the commerical breaks, but there are none. There are no audio commentaries on the disc; Producer Bruce Timm appears at the start of each episode with a brief (less than 2.5 min) bit, but he could have easily done two or three terrific commentary tracks for EACH episode. There are only two extras, and neither of them are any good. There is a ""game"" that basically pieces together segments from the cartoons, and a featurette on how to draw Batman that lasts less than a minute. The two-minute pilot that Timm used to sell the show to Warner Bros. was supposed to be included, but it's nowhere to be found (unless it's an easter egg). Overall, the disc is as bare-bones as the early DVD releases, and WB's poor extras can't hide that fact.
Still, this is a no-brainer purchase for fans. The disc is affordable, and the quality of the show guarantees repeated viewings. Hopefully good sales of this disc will pursuade Warner Bros. to load up the next few installments.",1019606400,,2075,4.782729805013927

I strongly recommend all seasons of this series to Batman fans, young and old alike.",1489536000,,249,5.073170731707317

7956669,5,B00005Y772,"Batman: The Animated Series totally defines my childhood. The 90's is home to some of the best cartoons and this series certainly still holds up. Surprised this show was for kids with it's overall darker tone. Best superhero cartoon, although it could be debated whether or not Bruce Wayne/ Batman is a superhero given that he has no super powers. Batman is still my favorite because he is somewhat more believable.",1456099200,,415,4.859154929577465
