8027973,5,B0002HDDQ4,"I first ran across this on Youtube, and fell enough in love with it to make sure I could buy it.  It's a beautiful Russian fairy tale, and yes, it's subbed instead of dubbed.  I love the outfits, the story, and all the parts where you could see the old-school movie tricks like rewinding a take to make it look like Baba Yaga is taking a huge jump backward into a tree.  If you're like me and found Disney's Frog and the Princess movie a little unsatisfying, feast your eyes on this.  Yes, it's pretty much a classic damsel in distress and handsome rescuer story, but there are definitely more things to watch than tired stereotypes.",1431993600,2,633,4.431034482758621

8027975,4,B0002HDDQ4,"I love fantasy films; however, unlike the genres of science fiction and horror, finding a really good one can be a challenge.  I stumbled across an online trailer for this film, and was taken in by the imagery.  The presence of English subtitles, plus an attractive price, convinced me to give it a try.

Three brothers are advised by their father to shoot an arrow into the air, and the area in which it lands will be the place each young man will find a bride.  The elder two think they have found suitable choices, but the youngest brother's arrow lands beside a frog.  Nonplussed, he brings the frog home out of pity.  The two other women (left to do manual labor to prove they are worthy), toss the animal out the window, and a beautiful woman appears in its place.  Vassilisa, as she is called, was the victim of a curse by a three-headed serpent.  When Ivanushka, the youngest brother, learns of this, he sets off on a quest to vanquish the creature and lift the curse.

With these simple, even familiar. story threads, the filmmakers are able to weave a fairly effective little fantasy.  Though obviously filmed on a shoestring budget, the film does offers some bold visuals and rudimentary effects.  The most memorable of these is a giant spider with glowing eyes, who traps Ivanushka in its web.  We also get to see him battle the serpent, which can breathe fire and even spew out enough water to the flood the land.  The creature's right-hand-woman is Baba Yaga, a triumph of perfectly hideous makeup, which rivals that of Max Shreck's unearthly Count Orlok in Nosferatu (1922).

On the downside, an over-reliance on running the film backwards to achieve certain effects becomes tiresome.  And the many matte paintings are clearly, well, matte paintings.  These things can, of course, be sort of charming for those willing to suspend their disbelief.

Image's DVD offers a restored print that isn't perfect--there are numerous clicks on the audio soundtrack, as well as a few long shots that are blurry--but is mostly very acceptable.  There are short featurettes on the film itself, and Russian fairy tales in general.

If you're looking for something different, and enjoy exploring films of other cultures, ""Vassilisa the Beautiful"" might be just what you're looking for.  And anyone with an interest in fantasy cinema will likely enjoy it.",1398211200,2,2353,4.835
8027976,5,B0002HDDQ4,A very nice fairy tale with the meaning of fairy tales. Generally I  love the Russian fairy tales  and that dvd was one more excuse to say that.,1359244800,2,144,4.107142857142857
8027977,5,B0002HDDQ4,"This movie is in black and white with English subtitles.  These are usually barriers for kids, but my daughter, aged seven, loves this movie.  Good triumphs over evil after much perseverance.  Earthier and more engaging than what you typically find.",1264809600,3,249,5.175
