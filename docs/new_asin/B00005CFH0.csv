1425423,3,B00005CFH0,"This is a very interesting and thoughtful production about the 16th President of the United States, and his wife Mary Todd Lincoln.
Not only is it very informative and educational. But I hope that even if you have been reading and learning about Lincoln for a very long time. That you will learn something new and truthful from this DVD documentary set.
The only thing I found disappointing what that they didn't share any  information. On Lincoln's influences with his other relationships ( ie: Joshua Speed, William H. Herndon, John Nicolay * and etc...) however I guess that is another story.
 I also found it interesting how some of the scholars and such. Were almost trying to revive Mary Todd's legacy. That was almost really shattered by Herndon because Mary and William hated each other so much.
 This however is really a wonderful addition to any one's DVD library. The set even talks after of Lincoln's death and what became of Mary through out the years.
Really a wonderful set for any one who really wants to learn more about the Lincoln's.",1081900800,13,1052,4.769230769230769

Mary hasn't always had a fair pov in history. I love this documintry as it shows how intelltgent she was and that she really was ahead of her time.

1425426,5,B00005CFH0,"Now that Ken Burns' epic ""The Civil War"" has hit DVD, this 3 disc baby of David Grubin's will keep you entertained just as much. David McCullough's narration in this film is as pleasant as it was in the former, and David Morse reads Lincoln as well as Sam Waterston. Holly Hunter reading Mary also does well. Plus like The Civil War, there is a who's who of interviewees who relate some very good historical facts. This is the first film that I ever watched on American Experience. A welcome edition to my library let alone the collection of PBS documentaries now available on DVD.",1013904000,20,581,4.542857142857143
1425427,4,B00005CFH0,"During the pivotal Presidential election of 1860, three of the four major candidates running for the White House had once courted Mary Todd.  The story of how this young woman spurned Stephen Douglass and John Breckenridge in favor of Abraham Lincoln has always been a fascinating tale.  The fact that this same woman ended up committed for insanity after her fragile emotions failed to survive the deaths of her husband and three of her four sons.  The title of David Grubin's film, as well as the first episode, traces the parallel courses of the future couple.  Both lost their mothers when young and had completely opposite reactions to their stepmothers.  More importantly, when they found each other they were able to recognition they shared the same ambition and this most improbably couple made their way to the White House at the most pivotal moment in the nation's history.
Of course it is history that overwhelms the story Grubin sets off to tell.  For the last two thirds of ""A House Divided,"" basically from the start of the Civil War until the assassination of Lincoln, Mary becomes a minor character.  However, given the essentially balanced nature of the first couple of episodes, this shift becomes somewhat disconcerting.  Eventually I adjusted to this shift, having recognized that the Civil War certainly put Lincoln's marriage on the back burner, but I think Grubin could have cut two hours from this series, whittling down the recapitulation of basic Civil War history to keep the focus on the increasingly unhappy couple.  After all, that is the hook that is used to reel us into watching this documentary, which originally aired on PBS's ""American Experience.""
Each of the three-videotapes in this series contains two episodes.  Comparisons with Ken Burns's landmark ""Civil War"" series are inevitable not only because of the subject matter but because David McCullough again does the narration as the unofficial voice of the Civil War.  There are certainly some stylistic differences, which result in some melodramatic moments in this series, which begins with a storm night and children whispering about the crazy lady living in the room over the parlor of that Springfield house.  Civil War battles are a conglomerate of black & white period photos and firework explosions.  You will recognize Holly Hunter as the voice of Mary Lincoln right away, but might be surprised to learn that David Morse is doing Abraham Lincoln (I know I was).  Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think Grubin could have edited a two hour version of this focusing on Mary Tood Lincoln that would have been absolutely first rate.  However, let me be clear that as it now stands ""Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided"" is definitely worth viewing.",1012608000,18,2765,4.980434782608696
1425428,4,B00005CFH0,"I was very pleased to see a documentary about the relationship between the Lincolns because there are so many stories and myths surrounding their relationship.  I enjoyed the documentary, but because all the trials and tribulations are revealed, I found myself extremely depressed.",1003363200,7,281,5.534883720930233
1425429,2,B00005CFH0,"When I first started watching this film I was very pleased to see that it was made by David Grubin. I was familiar with his earlier work on Lyndon Johnson which was outstanding and on America in the year 1900 which was also very good. However, it soon became apparent that this film was not up to those standards. In brief, this film could have easily been cut to half its length and not lost anything. We see Mary Lincoln as a long suffering wife who is forced to cope with the long absences of her husband on the lawyer's circuit in his younger days and later his almost continual distraction with the Civil War when he was President. It is pointed out that she was a very ambitious young woman and she decided to hitch her wagon to the rising star of Abraham Lincoln. In this way, she was similar to other super-ambitious politician's wives like Jackie Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson and Hilary Clinton who also had to cope with things like serial philandering, self-absorbed husbands who would ignore their wives for long periods of time or engage in destructive political policies that led to the disruption of their private lives. I don't know how much sympathy we can spare for people who bring these things on themselves. The film is visually very boring with the same few photographs of Abraham and Mary Lincoln shown over and over or with endless repetitions of trains speeding over railroad tracks, telegraph tickers clicking and horses pulling carriages and items that she purchased on her buying binges. For some reason, we only see the lower half of whatever people are shown in various re-enactments. I guess showing their faces would confuse us and remind us that this was actually filmed in the 21st Century and not the 19th. Although I assume the idea of the film was to get into the ""personal"" side of the Lincolns' we are never told that Lincoln received a US Government patent for a device he invented (but never marketed) designed to refloat boats that got grounded on shoals or sand bars which indicated that this man who had only one year of formal education and yet managed to become one of the most successful lawyers in Illinois also managed to teach himself the rudiments of mechanical engineering. Also, never mentioned was his determined opposition to the overwhelmingly popular Mexican War during his single term in the US House of Representatives which must have stirred up public resentment against him and which would have certainly affected his private life as well. Finally, although we are told at length about Lincoln's children and the tragic deaths that took all them except for Robert at a young age, we are only told that Mary disowned Robert for having her committed to a mental hospital but how this, and all the other events of the family's life affected Robert himself is never mentioned. Robert lived to a ripe old age and became a cabinet Secretary (he also was, in a tragic irony, present in the vicinity not only the assassination of his father, but also those of President Garfield in 1881 and President McKinley in 1901). In summary, I would recommend this film only for those who want to complete their collections on Lincoln or the Civil War.",995587200,17,3192,4.722222222222222

Theres so much to weep for here, evenly distributed amongst the war, the tragedies of the death of the Lincoln children and then the assassination. Just when you feel you can catch your breath free of tears, along comes something else heartbreakingly tender.

This should be required viewing.  Especially for Lincoln fans.  So many of the younger generation don't really have an understanding of The Civil War.  Some don't have a clue and for some, this would clear up any lingering doubts.

1425453,5,B00005CFH0,"""My wife is as handsome as when she was a girl. I, a poor nobody, fell in love with her then. And what's more...I have never fallen out"".//quote Abraham Lincoln

There are generally two schools of thought on the Lincoln marriage. The first are historians, scholars and regular Lincolnites who insist that the marriage was a living hell for Abe Lincoln, one that pretty much destroyed his emotional life. I call this The Herndon School.

Then there is a more recent approach. It was a difficult, stormy, even dysfunctional relationship, but these two people did indeed love one another. And if Mary was not the depraved witch who Lincoln married under duress, neither was Abe always some long suffering saint who bore his cross with patience.

What is baffling is that people who insist the marriage was loveless are ignoring the words straight from the horse's mouth. Abraham Lincoln himself. He fell in love, he remained in love.

This informative, heartbreaking series explains the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of how these two vastly different people came together, made a family, and achieved a goal together...only to see their great triumph ultimately destroy their family and ruin their lives. Because that is exactly what the Presidency did. Starting with the death of the much loved Willie, and Mary's subsequent emotional breakdown(the death of this favorite child of both herself and Abraham was the beginning of the end for her),the nightmarish toll the Civil War took on their marriage in general and on Lincoln in particular..until April 14th, Ford's Theatre, and John Wilkes Booth put the final, traumatic end to the journey.

Mary would essentially never know another happy day in what was left of her life, which descended into a nightmare worthy of Kafka.

This is an indispensable DVD for anyone who might believe they know all there is to know about America's most tragic First Couple.

1425461,5,B00005CFH0,"Every other year or so I watch this marvellous look at the Lincoln Presidency, the Civil War (or War Between the States, depending how you look at it) and Lincoln's relationship with his complex, difficult wife.

Many people have commented on the almost uncanny similarties & events between Lincoln's Presidency with that of the Kennedy era. One such connection is that Mary Lincoln set out to create a higher standard of elegance for the rather shabby White House at that time. Although she characteristically went way over budget, most commentators praised her good taste. Apparently prior wives were more inhibited by the mores of the time to effect any domestic changes in the Presidencial abode. As an aside note, Mary Todd Lincoln was the first wife to be called ""First Lady."" Jackie Kennedy's elegance & style not only won over masses of Americans, she impressed & wowed much of the world. I remember that when the Kennedy's went on a State tour of South America, many people on the street held up placards with the slogan ""JACKIE SI, JACK NO!""

Unfortunately Mary Todd Lincoln was much less fortunate. The documentary clearly indicates that she probably suffered from a dysfunctional combo of Manic-Depression & Obsesskive Compulsive disorder. When her favorite son Willie died, she brought mediums into the White house in a sad attempt to reestablish some sort of communication with him (so-called ""psychics"" have much to answer for then--and now.) Where Jackie O. was adulated, Mary Todd was almost universally vivilified. The Press saw a vulnerable target & went for it.

However, in one segment of the documentary we discover that Mary Lincoln formed a close relationship with a ""freed slave"" woman--who just happened to have worked for Confederate First Lady Mrs. Jefferson Davis. This woman had also lost a son & Mary Lincoln identified with & trusted her. In was through this relationship of kindred souls that Mary became involved with the abolitionist movement much more intimately than her husband ever did. African-American commentators in the film elaborate on this & many other pivotal points.

In regards to Lincoln himself, A HOUSE DIVIDED masterfully presents the figure of a man with enormous depth of character & concern. Although a principled abolitionist, Lincoln may not may not have been the total intergrationist one would hope, but his moral stand was sincere & the best that could be hoped for in the milieu in which he lived. He was a man of integrity, forced by fate to participate in a horrendous war that was pulling a new nation apart. The cause of the North was just, but that didn't erase the bloody consequences of the cause. A soulful man, the conequences of the war were devastating on Lincoiln. Some said that he almost resembled a corpse. Nonetheless, his ungainly appearance was trumped by a principled moral conviction far above his race or time. In my estimation, Abraham Lincoln was the greatest American President...ever.",1335052800,4,2971,5.032520325203252

1425469,5,B00005CFH0,"MARY TODD LINCOLN is revived by mothers who live troubles...

Mrs. Lincoln came from a wealthy family and maybe ""caviar dreams"" but her life takes on a storyline like the wretched and powerless yet she sits in the First Lady Seat Of American Power.  She lost one son in his childhood, then another and another; she had one left but she was exhausted because in the meantime the American Civil War occurs and Mary had relatives on both side though she felt totally loyal to Abe Lincoln and the northern side of America.  (There was death and hell all around her.) She said that she wished her southern relatives' peril because if they were able to they would kill her husband and bring down the government he headed.  IN JUST THE AMERICAN WAY that it should be, two women came together to talk about their losses and to help each other cope with their healing by helping others who had escaped from American slavery: one the daughter of a wealthy southerner who bought and sold people for slavery and a woman, a highly skilled dressmaker, who had once made dresses for the southerners' First Lady,and who herself was once held in bondage and forced to be a slave. She became Mary's friend and confidante.  Life was going on for Mary and she was coping one step at a time and going forward when suddenly during an evening out at a theater her husband was shot in the head and his blood splattered over her. Mary's mind made its decision: It is time to check out, kaput, go mad, shut down from shock after shock after shock!!!!

Abe had warned Mary that if she was not able to absorbed life's bad tidings and recover and go on and not shut down she would end up in an assylum.  That's where she landed; yet, another tradgedy but Mary dispatched her powerful friends (under-cover) and they came to rescue her; she lived in France for a while then returned to America.

The Lincoln's were quiet people who wanted to do their jobs and live their lives with love and happiness.  Mary did not mind being left by ABE while he was away on America's business.  She stood by her husband as an American First Lady.

(*There are stories that her husband had ""intimate male friends"" but these stories are. not mentioned in this documentary.)

I have great sympathy and empathy for this First Lady's Life.  I feel Mary suffered a lot and though she did not stand up with (ideal) courage so we could praise her and honor her for that sort of strength; I feel strongly that Mary Todd Lincoln is the patron for American mothers who live troubles (no matter what their skin color is and no matter their body size and income and all that) but mothers who seem to live all the really hard and troubling knocks from life.  Mary's life also teaches that it is best to learn how to ""forgive"" and ""let go"" and go on and gain strength from your personal ability to NOT linger in mourning or wallow in pity, (something like that).

But that's a really hard thing to do if you lose three children, some siblings and your husband is shot sitting next to you and his blood splatters all over you...so have no shame in your game if you can't get up right away...but definitely intend-to before somebody locks you away and you can't get out.

1425470,5,B00005CFH0,"This excellent program is really two biographies in one.  We get side by side biographies of both Lincoln and Mary.  Both of these biographies are then put into context of their socieites and the politics and ultimately the war that had an impact on everyone's life and broken families... Just when things seem to be settling down, there is a visit from Mary's confederate half sister.

The pace is methodical, which some might find slow, but it has a real payoff in the moments when we can really savor the richness of Lincoln's words and the choices he makes in the moment.  Holly Hunter was a really poor choice for Mary's voice, her lateral lisp is too distracting for voiceover work, and her choice of breathy delivery was off putting.  She's a good actress, just a poor choice for voiceover work, and especially for this role.  A ""name"" is not always a good solution for a difficult voice casting choice.  David McCullough's narration is seamless, as usual, Mr. Morse as the voice of Lincoln really fit perfectly - his voice seemed to be Lincoln and it was ""unnoticable"" and that is great vocal casting.

The variety of historians is a great window - from the Mary Lincoln historian who breathlessly relates Mary's side of things, to the writer who talks about Lincoln's choices as a writer, to the African American historians, one who thinks Lincoln didn't do enough, the other who appreciates that Lincoln evolved and had a good sense of how much and where he could push.

An excellent series, it would make an excellent gift for repeated viewings.",1250035200,2,1556,4.733333333333333
1425471,5,B00005CFH0,"I had seen this on television several years ago.  It's still so darn popular that you can't get a great price on it anywhere.  The price here was ok, but not great. It's expensive anywhere!  I love the integration of BOTH Lincoln stories (his and hers) and the chronological integration of family and Civil War.  Enjoyable soundtrack.  Very fine reading by professional actors.  Well-paced.",1247184000,5,390,5.015625
1425472,5,B00005CFH0,"The 3-part DVD series provides an in-depth overview of the life and times of both Lincolns, problems encountered throughout their lives and crises of the USA during their lives.  The many photos and opinions provide food for thought and discussion.",1226793600,,248,5.2
1425473,5,B00005CFH0,"Having just read a book about Mary Todd Lincoln I was interested to learn more about both Lincolns and their lives together.  This video presentation gives wonderful information about their lives before they met and what differing backgrounds they came from, including family history, education, etc.  We then learn about their courtship and marriage and family life.  Woven into this family story are the political events of the time
covered in interesting detail.  All is told using old photographs interspersed with commentary by various historians and experts of the Civil War.  The story moves on to Lincoln's political career and his rise to become President.  During this time, Mary deals with the loss of one son, to be followed during the White House years with the loss of a second son.  The tragedy around this couple, both of a personal nature and of a national nature are devastating.  The coverage of the Civil War years are particularly interesting and Lincoln's dealings with the war and it's attendant battles, casualities, changes in military leadership really bring home the devastation of this war on the country.  As the war progresses Lincoln's quiet strength, intelligence, and determination resound.  Lincoln's assassination is covered in harrowing detail and the subsequent downward slide of Mary into depression, sadness and more tragedy to come.  It is refreshing to see a more sympathetic portrait of Mary Lincoln than is usually presented.  Knowing what we know today about depression and other mental illnesses makes her behaviors during her life much easier to understand and sympathize with.  She ended her life with only one of her four sons still living and she was estranged from him at the time of her death.  All in all this is a fascinating portrait of a couple who loved each other very dearly and how that love was tested by events beyond their control.",1214956800,8,1893,5.064516129032258
1425474,5,B00005CFH0,"This documentry is so wonderfully done that you can't stop watching until it you have watched it all.  You really get a wonderful portrait of the Lincoln's and the heart rendering situations this great couple endured.  The combination of actual pictures,the portrayals of Lincoln and Mary through actors and actresses, and the visuals of the actual places throughout are just exquisitely done!!  A real masterpiece!!",1205625600,2,416,5.369230769230769
1425475,5,B00005CFH0,"This is an excellent documentary which studies Lincon's life in depth. I would recommend this DVD set for everyone.
Specially, if you are into history and the civil war.",1199232000,3,169,4.862068965517241
1425476,5,B00005CFH0,"I found this to be an excellent documentary. Informative, unsentimental, and moving, the film makes these iconic figures human without losing sight of their historical importance. Holly Hunter as the voice of Mary Lincoln is really genius in her portrayal of the beleaguered First Lady. David Morse as Lincoln also does a fine job and the contemporary photographs are well chosen. For a three disc set this is a bargain and as a ""Linconphile"" I have watched it many times. Particularly interesting are the comments of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David Herbert Donald - both noted Lincoln biographers. Highly reccommended.",1187136000,6,618,5.19
1425477,4,B00005CFH0,"This is an excellent dvd.  The depth of the information presented is the best I've seen thus far!  I have only one criticism of it -- there was no mention of the conspiracy to kill Lincoln!!  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  However, either A&E or the History Channel did a fantastic job in portraying the plot to kill Lincoln and also would be worth investing in.  It had the whole elaborate plan about how Boothe conspired to kill not only Lincoln, but the vice president and the secretary of state as well.  Between the two products, you would have an excellent representation of what actually happened.  After seeing both these dvds, I can honestly say I was glad to know that Boothe had been shot!!  Not that I advocate shooting anyone for any reason!!

The material on this particular dvd was very well presented and used some reenactment scenes.  I enjoyed hearing all the views of each of the historians as the information given brought it more to life than just reading about it!

In my opinion, this dvd was very definitely well worth the price and I would highly recommend it!",1177459200,5,1098,4.522842639593908
1425478,5,B00005CFH0,"It has often been observed that Abraham Lincoln has been enshrined to the point of deification.  During the recent Ronald Reagan obsequies, rituals laden with religious references, we the television viewers were treated again & again to images of the Lincoln Memorial, as though Lincoln himself were some sort of national demigod to whom proper deference must be rendered from time to time.  All this has served to strip away much of Lincoln's humanity, to the point that we find it hard to believe that he was, just as most of us are, an ordinary spouse & parent, trying to balance the demands of home with the demands of work.
This documentary helps to remind us of that side of Lincoln, as we see the young ambitious lawyer/politician & his equally ambitious wife struggle to make a life together.  It is a story, above everything else, of great personal loss (for both Abraham & Mary Lincoln), and at times it makes this documentary painful to watch.  As one watches Abraham Lincoln cope the overwhelming stress of a wartime presidency, having already lost two children, one yearns for the time when Abraham & Mary Lincoln can finally, even for a little while, relax in retirement and enjoy each other's company once again, without the demands of the office to distract them.  Despite knowing it never did happen, I found myself feeling this way.  Of course, the story takes the viewer through to a marriage ended by murder & a subsequent emotional collapse.  It is exhausting to watch.
The documentary provides a great amount of detail.  Some have complained that one sees the same images of the Lincolns over and over again, although I would think that after ""The Civil War,"" people would be used to seeing an unending series of still photos on the television screen.  It comes with the territory, and unless you want actors dramatizing the life of the Lincolns, you really have little choice in presentation.  My only objection with the documentary is that it is a little too sympathetic at times.  For example, the fact that the Lincolns were not particularly good parents is overlooked.  Even in the best of times, Robert Lincoln's relationship with his parents was ambivalent, and was sometimes downright chilly.  Tad Lincoln, on the other hand, was so spoiled and overindulged that by the time he was around 12, he was a virtual illiterate because his parents didn't have the heart to make him attend to his studies.  One gets no sense of this in the documentary.
Everyone loves a happy ending, but unfortunately there really isn't one to be found here.  However, the saddest tales generally are the ones that leave the most lasting impact.  One cannot watch this story without being deeply moved.",1087430400,49,2708,4.829004329004329
1425479,5,B00005CFH0,"This documentary on the life of Abraham Lincoln is an excellent exploration of the character and inner life of our 16th president. At the same time it provides the viewer with much valuable information about the character of his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, their marriage, the tragic deaths of two of their children, and how Lincoln continued to love his wife until his death, even though she was in many ways a liability for him. While the Lincolns as individuals are the focus of the series, the viewer is not shortchanged in regard to the presidency or the Civil War. Lincoln's growth during his four years in office is examined critically and fairly by various historians.
The story of the Lincolns was originally shown on PBS's program ""American Experience,"" and follows the format that has made that series so respected by viewers. Photographs, drawings, paintings, maps, and other artifacts contemporary to the times alternate with new film footage that enhances the story line. Well known performers do the voiceovers -- in this case David Morse is Lincoln, and Holly Hunter is the voice of Mary Todd Lincoln. There are no stagey recreations of events with unknown performers taking the parts of historical characters, which one often sees in series made for The History Channel or Arts and Entertainment Network. The three volume set runs about six hours and contains bonus materials that appear on each individual disc. The quality of the picture and sound is outstanding. The music is excellent and of the time period, and is never distacting.
While people of all ages and backgrounds in American history could enjoy this series, I especially recommend it to families with high school or college age students, along with Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" and the PBS video biography of General Grant. This would also make an excellent gift for Father's Day or for a Civil War buff's birthday.",1086393600,78,1892,4.952830188679245

Mary comes off as an interesting mixture of aggravating and big-hearted. Lincoln, of course, comes off as a political genius but also as someone whose tragic past haunted him, but who dealt with that by becoming an extraordinarily compassionate, funny and empathetic human being and a great wartime leader - and one heck of a pragmatist.",1427328000,2,491,4.927710843373494
