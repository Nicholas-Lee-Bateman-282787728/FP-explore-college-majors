Now they have Australian Idol's Cosima De Vito reading one of their magical stories to a bunch of little kids and it's truly, well, MAGICAL!!  You just must collect the whole set - search MAGICAL SCARECROWS - AUNTIE LYNN.  This video shows Cosima and other celebs with one of the MANY charity aspects to this magical series.
