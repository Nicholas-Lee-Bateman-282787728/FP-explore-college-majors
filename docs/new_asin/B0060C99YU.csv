8490354,4,B0060C99YU,"I seriously like Bill's unorthodox approach to escapes. My only point of criticism is being a small guy, some don't wotk for me. The amount of escapes coupled with entertainment value makes it worth it and the production great. I recommend it",1413244800,,242,4.785714285714286

8490356,4,B0060C99YU,"Summary:  Good source for unorthodox escapes, but fairly low production value.  Bill Cooper is amazing but unless you are a fan, you might not enjoy this.

8490359,5,B0060C99YU,"I would recommend this DVD.  I would say this DVD is great for anyone blue belt and above.  The escapes shown are not your basic and standard escapes.
