3644454,4,B001HUHBC2,"Yes, the price may be more than some shows, the same as others, and lower than some.  The point is the studio found a structure that would allow this to be released.  We've waited many years for Love Boat to come to DVD and if you decide not to spend a few extra dollars then you are telling the studio you don't want the Love Boat on DVD, and they will stop releasing them.  Of course I wish they were less expensive, and full seasons, but I like the show and am happy to own the episodes.  Ranting about half seasons and high costs will NOT change how these are being released.  It will only guarantee them to no longer be released.",1228867200,23,634,4.163934426229508
3644455,1,B001HUHBC2,"People, you DON'T have to let yourself get ripped off by this half-season scheme.  Compare this to Dallas, which was a MUCH more popular and expensive show, and you can buy most of the full season packs for less than $25 per season.  Same goes for several other TV shows from the same era as Love Boat.  Contact Paramount and let them know how angry you are a them for trying to rip you off.  There's NO WAY I'm going let them rip ME off with this stupid scheme.  It's only a TV show.  I'll wait till they release it the way I want it and until then they don't get a penny from me.",1228521600,10,581,4.008695652173913

I can only hope that more seasons will be forthcoming. They don't give this anymore on the television and even if they did, these shows are a must have. The kind of show you want to own so that you can watch anytime you want. Once I watch this and volume 2 that is it. So let's hope that more is to come.

3644498,5,B001HUHBC2,I grew up watching the Love Boat.  It was great seeing all those movies stars from past to currect.  It was a show with most of the time happy endings.  It was an hour spent away from the real world. Great show.  Highly recommended.,1381708800,,232,4.204545454545454
3644499,5,B001HUHBC2,"I also own seasons 1 (both parts) and season 2 volume 2.  This is my least favorite of the 4, but still good.  70's TV seems so innocent in its humor now, but somehow the humor translates well, to me--I love the shameless campiness of this show.  Plus, every star in country was on this show sooner or later.  For some reason, this episode was also the hardes of the 4 to find--you can easily find the other episodes in other markets, but I only found this one on Amazon.  It has some funny moments--Billy Crystal as the masked ""kissing bandit"" was probably the best, in my opinion.  Other stars on this one include John Astin, Dick Martin, Sonny Bono, Erik Estrada, Robert Reed, Toni TenilleGary Collins, Joan Blondell, Vincent Price, Richard Dawson, Loretta Swit, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, June Allyson, Van Johnson, Edward Albert, Rue McClanahan, Sid Caesar, to name a few of the many familliar faces.

3644507,5,B001HUHBC2,"""The Love Boat"" cruised into their second season with brighter stars, campier stories and lots of loooooove.

This show is predictable, loopy and corny, and yet.....I so enjoy it.  Maybe I'm a little loopy and corny, myself.  At any rate, it's always a wonderful trip down memory lane and good fun with a few laughs here and there.

The gang's all here:  Captain Stubing, Doc, Julie, Isaac and Gopher.  This time around, we meet Julie's parents played by Betty Garrett and Norman Fell.  We also meet Gopher's sister played by ""Little House on the Prairie's"" Melissa Sue Anderson.  That's one of my favorite episodes of this half season, because disco maniac and ""Dance Fever"" host Deney Terrio shows up and dances with her in a scene that is laugh-out-loud funny.  To think of some loon starting to dance like that (as my grandmother would say...'like a worm in hot ashes') in the middle of everyone else dancing and minding their own business is truly hilarious.

Other stars and celebrities who show up are:  Sonny Bono, Judy Landers(after all, what's a 70's or 80's show without a Landers sister), Erik Estrada, Allen Ludden, Billy Crystal, Robert Reed, Vincent Price (in their Halloween episode), Robert Goulet, Janet Leigh, Greg Morris, June Allyson, Van Johnson, Peter Graves, Rhonda Fleming, Florence Henderson, Connie Stevens, Rue McClanahan, Sid Caesar and twins Cyb and Trish Barnstable (who I've never seen before or since...do with that what you will).

Volume one of season two offers 12 episodes and one two-hour movie to start the season.  The quality is great.  These shows are fun and make you feel good - there's a lot of pretty, bright color and light romance.  Bring on the rest of the other seasons!",1343520000,6,1720,4.882758620689655
3644508,2,B001HUHBC2,"When I opened the case, the two ""holders"" on which the DVD's were mounted, were sliding around, and there were pieces of the mechanism all over the case.  Some of them looked as if they were broken.  I was on the point of returning the item but could not decide whether I wanted a credit or the same thing again.  Fortunately I have an ingenious son who was able to put the whole thing back together again.  He convinced me that there were no broken parts, but that the whole mechanism had just fallen apart.

Now every time I want to play one of those DVDs, I am handling the case with kid gloves so that such an accident does not happen again.  But I do hope that I never see this type of mechanism again.  For that reason I will refrain from buying future seasons and forego the pleasure of seeing more episodes of this nostalgic show, just in case they are packaged the same way.

The show itself deserves at least 4 stars, the deduction is for the packaging.",1335398400,,963,4.281767955801105
3644509,5,B001HUHBC2,"Loved that show in the 80s and still I do. Love to see the episodes with all his special guest like: Peter Graves, Joan Blondell, Rue McClanahan, Florence Henderson, Rhonda Flemming, Robert Urich (who played the Captain in ""The Love Boat: The next Waves""), Heather Menzies-Urich (one of former child in ""Sound of Music"") - are only a few names of this Volume 1 of the second Season.

Ok, I don't like this 2-half-Season Boxes - but its better than nothing.

Good: the DVD's contains english subtitles - for foreign speaking like me its a big help. The biggest difference between the German and US-TV airing: the german dubbed version doesn't contain the laughing in the background.

The Picture Quality is very good!

Of course not every episode is very good but the show contains funny and very well written dialogues like: ""Doc"" Adam: ""Can we see us later?"", Woman answer: ""Not when I have you seen first!"".

Bonus: Promo's Trailer.

FaZIT: I love it - let's make a Cruise!",1331683200,3,975,4.705882352941177
3644510,4,B001HUHBC2,I enjoyed the video that was sent to me very well. I just wish you had it in vhs format as well. I know vhs is outdated but it would be wonderful if we could still get videos that are on dvd also in vhs format seeing there are some of us who still own vcrs. And I would prefer a vcr or vhs video over a dvd disc. Dvds have a tendency if they don't read right they stop or skip a lot where the video version the only thing you have to worry about if the tape is to get eaten by the machine otherwise they could last a lot longer. I still own all my videos from the time I got my very first vcr and there are many things on them that could never be found on a dvd. Sandy.,1298073600,,669,3.6527777777777777
3644511,4,B001HUHBC2,"The first thirteen episodes from the second season of THE LOVE BOAT.  Welcome back aboard the Pacific Princess, where lovely cruise director Julie McCoy (Lauren Tewes), Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Dr. Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), Purser ""Gopher"" Smith (Fred Grandy), and lively barman Isaac Washington (Ted Lange) will ensure that all your entertainment needs are met.

The second season gets off to a strong start in a movie-length opener, ""Marooned / The Search / Isaac's Holiday"", where several passengers are taken hostage by an eccentric old hermit (played by John Astin) during a day-stop.  Isaac attempts to impress guest star Lola Falana by passing himself off as a millionaire; and a young woman is reunited with her estranged birth mother.  Guests for this special story include Edie Adams, David Birney, Audra Lindley, Laraine Day and Donna Mills.

Co-producer Douglas Cramer always maintained that the secret to THE LOVE BOAT's success was it's careful, constant mix of the three storylines - namely, a farce, a romantic comedy, and a ""warmedy"" (Cramer's term, not mine).  Surely, a lot of the audience appeal was the roster of guest stars - a fun combination of Hollywood greats, has-beens and five-minute-wonders.  One of the more offbeat episodes included in this collection is ""Ship of Ghouls"", a special Halloween show, which has Iris Adrian, Joan Blondell, Vincent Price and Jane Kean, mixing it with Gary Collins and Mary Ann Mobley.

Throw on your finest Nolan Miller fashions and join the gang on the Fiesta Deck!  The Pacific Princess will be departing soon!

3644512,2,B001HUHBC2,"Whatever charm this show ever possessed has long gone.  Full of ridiculous plotlines, and actors who were has beens, were never really stars to begin with and flash in the pan relics its enough to make you want to jump overboard.  I keep watching episode after episode hoping for some substance but its the  same thing over and over again.  The laugh track is anoying the sets cheap and the scripts corny to a tee.  I guess it worked for it's time but it's so out of place today.  They tried to revive it in 1999 but the ship sank after only one season.  The opening episode of this tug boat the two hour one is so over the top and stupid it makes Mr. Rogers neighborhood seem like shakespeare.  It was like crossing Gilligan's Island with The Poseidon Adventure; except there was no famous underwater swim.  I  think the Shark Bruce from Jaws should have made  a cameo to liven things up.  I would have fed Doc to him in a heartbeat.  I laugh every time I see Berni Kopell trying to pick up a woman; he thinks he is this hot stud; buddy have you looked in the mirror lately?  In fact none of the four main characters  even come close to being attractive.  We bought this because we remembered seeing it when we were kids and I guess it showed some fascination then but boy did we get a rude awakening as adults watching this tripe.  I think I'll throw this volume and the previous season overboard on my next cruise.  BTW I'm surprised the cruise industry didn't protest to all the hanky panky going on aboard between crew and passengers. Does working on a cruise ship give you the right to sexually harass passengers coming on?  Next time I'm on board a cruise ship, I'll ask my cabin steward for a little extra service...according to this ship wreck its perfectly acceptable.",1254441600,,1778,4.415384615384616

3644514,5,B001HUHBC2,It is worth seeing if you are a love boat fan.  I enjoy the stories and the stars.  I am glad they make these DVD's so you can enjoy the memories.,1247270400,2,146,3.6774193548387095
3644515,5,B001HUHBC2,So thrilled to finally have Love Boat on DVD.....I only wish they would release them a little quicker!!!,1241049600,,104,4.833333333333333
3644524,5,B001HUHBC2,"I can hardly wait for Vol 2!!  We understand dividing up the seasons. Love Boat was not only an hour show, but also had a 2 hour season premier movie to kick off the season! I once again love seeing stars such as John Astin, Dick Martin, Melissa Gilbert, Robert Urich to name a few! You get a 2 hour movie and 12 episodes in Vol 1.  Come on Vol 2!!!",1240099200,,349,3.9014084507042255

3644526,5,B001HUHBC2,I am a huge fan of Love Boat and am so happy I've been able to get them through Amazon.  I just wish they would come out with each one a little faster!,1239753600,,151,3.5757575757575757
3644527,5,B001HUHBC2,"I grew up watching the Love Boat and so I bought it but with reservations.  I was concerned that it would be a copy and so the quality and resolution of the picture would suffer, but this was not the case!  It was superb! It was crisp and clear and so wonderful to watch.  My family and I have a wonderful time watching this DVD over and over again.  If you're a Love Boat fan like I am, you should get this!",1236816000,,408,3.9390243902439024
3644528,3,B001HUHBC2,I was really disappointed. After the long wait and split seasons they could done a better job at putting the show on DVD. The colors flashed for real to yellow and back again. Some of the show flashed from crystal clear to fuzzy then back again. This is not the way to treat loyal fans. They would have no money coming in if enough people would not buy due to this poor presentation and excess cost due to split seasons. I gave 3 stars because I admit I'm a die hard fan of the show and the episodes are still great.,1235606400,3,516,4.118811881188119
3644529,5,B001HUHBC2,"The Love Boat is/was my all-time favorite television program.  I am so very grateful to Amazon for making the series availabe once again and, if I live long enough (I'm 68), I plan to buy every set as they are released.",1235433600,3,219,4.341463414634147

3644532,5,B001HUHBC2,"I had been waiting for LOVE BOAT to come out on DVD, but it wasn't until I watched these again that I realized that this is the greatest cheese show of all time! I loved this and FANTASY ISLAND as a kid, but back then, I preferred the strange adventures of ISLAND. Watching these now, the goofy take on male/female relations and the mixture of tears with bad jokes is camp heaven. I love the relationship between the crew and seeing a rotating collection of stars great and small making their weekly visits. All the two hour films have been awful, so skip those and settle in for a consistently silly and wonderful show. It WOULD be nice to see an interview or two with the cast and I would love to get the Andy Warhol episode as a bonus! Please, keep 'em coming!",1233792000,,763,4.305555555555555
3644533,5,B001HUHBC2,"Only half of the season for the price of a whole one, but it was worth every dollar. The first episode is double-length and is by far the best. It features John Astin, Avery Schreiber, and Audra Lindley in some of their greatest roles.

This may be expensive for only half of the season, but I reconmend to anyone.",1233187200,4,314,4.322033898305085
