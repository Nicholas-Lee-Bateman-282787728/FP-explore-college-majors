5847279,1,B00DQAABZ0,Purchased this item because of the 5 star rating. Ms. Collins spoke in such an annoying sing-song monotone I  could barely focus on her instructions. There is absolutely nothing in this video that can't be seen for free on the internet.,1453248000,4,236,4.7560975609756095
5847280,4,B00DQAABZ0,This is pretty good.  I like it. Just have to do it every day. Very different from anything I have.  Worth purchasing.,1446681600,,118,4.318181818181818
5847281,5,B00DQAABZ0,"Having practiced yoga for many years I was so intrigued by the concept of ""face yoga""; I am so hooked on this now!!! I consider it my treat to myself every day!! It is like getting a massage; I feel so good afterwards and love Danielle's soothing voice. I am planning to give copies of this to my friends for Christmas!!",1440374400,,320,4.262295081967213
5847282,5,B00DQAABZ0,I got a sneak preview of Danielle Collins' workout on my cable ON DEMAND channel.  I had to find her DVDs.  Glad I did.,1439942400,,119,3.9166666666666665
5847283,4,B00DQAABZ0,"I have bought several 'face exercise' dvd's and this is the best. I just received it yesterday so I've only used it once, so no long term results to report. but, I did the entire dvd (its segregated into four 10 or so minute sessions) and I woke up this morning and the skin on my face feels very alive and tingling. that's never happened with any dvd or face exercises that I have done. there might be an immediate feeling of circulation but never has it lasted. I also do yoga and have for over ten years, so I'm always skeptical of anyone who claims that they are a yoga expert, but its clear that she knows what she is doing. she apparently had chronic fatigue syndrome when she was in her early 20's and healed herself through diet, yoga and stress management techniques.

she seems to me to be the real thing. a bit different than one might imagine, but I find her refreshing. hers is an inexpensive dvd. another website for face exercises that I looked at charges $299 for access! so, buy this and spend your hard earned money on something else. and no, I'm not getting paid for this review. I'm just really impressed.

****Update*****
This dvd is good, but I bought facial fitness by patricia goroway and I believe it to be a superior program of exercises.  so I no longer do this dvd, I do the goroway program.",1439078400,4,1319,4.375510204081633

I've had the dvd for about a month.  I have consistently done 2 ten minute segments almost every day since it arrived.  I usually do it in the evening before I go to bed.  it relaxes me.  the dvd combines exercises, acupressure and light pinching of the face to stimulate production of collagen and elastin.  my face is overall much more relaxed looking and I believe that the '11' lines between my forehead seem to be diminishing.  my skin feels a bit thicker than before I had the video.  I do some of the segments w/the sound off now, sometimes while watching tv.  there really is something special about this dvd and I plan to continue doing this program as it seems its definitely working.",1419984000,19,1849,4.456716417910448

8596241,5,B00DQAABZ0,"This DVD is a treasure.  By completing a section of face yoga every day, I am enjoying the benefits of increased blood flow and better looking complexion.  The menu includes the following sections: face massage;  upper face yoga; lower face and neck yoga; relaxation and acupressure for the face. I have seen improved muscle tone and tightening of my facial muscles.  I enjoy the positive affirmations at the end of the last section.  Just wonderful to leave me feeling uplifted. As a bonus, Danielle includes a relaxing 10 minute body yoga.  There is also a section with recipes for making natural skin care products.  All in all, I am so glad I purchased this little gem.",1508716800,2,673,4.75
8596242,4,B00DQAABZ0,"This is hard to rate, since it takes doing a lot of the exercises for months to know whether you are getting good results--and I haven't had the video that long. It's easy to follow, and it does seem that the exercises should have some benefit if done regularly. The making natural face products section is good, and the warm up and cool down are relaxing. Read a lot of reviews before purchasing, and many were turned off by her sing-song, repetitive style of speaking---if you can get by that (it's not hard) and focus on the exercises, it can be potentially useful. I'd like to see her produce an update to this.
*** update! I've been using this several times a week (trying to get up to every other day). Doing the exercises regularly definitely gives results. Due to time constraints, I've only been doing the upper and lower face exercises, but the warm up and cool down are great if you have extra time. Great to do at the beginning of the day--like most yoga it provides a sense of calm in addition to toning.",1493251200,2,1017,4.44385026737968

8596244,5,B00DQAABZ0,"This is a product I truly, truly believe in, enough so I'm willing to put my own picture to it.  I am a 40 year old woman.  Just a few short weeks ago, I actually had a sweet woman, probably a good 20 years older then me, mistake me for a woman in my mid 20's.  I nearly choked on the spot I was so stunned, then I decided I wanted to put her in my pocket and take her home with me for those days when I'm feeling lousy about myself and the aging process.  Because I am aging, but thanks to face yoga, and specifically her method, I don't look it as much as I could.

For the interest of self-disclosure, I have a dermatologist...the only thing he does is remove precancerous lesions.  Check out the pasty skin, ladies...and it just doesn't tan.  But since I really enjoy outdoors activities, I've paid the price in that I'm starting to get some sun spots (visible on the upper corners of my forehead, and not even face yoga can fix that) and I've had a few skin lesions in the process of turning into baddies that had to be removed for my own future safety, three of them from my face. Otherwise, I am wearing a thin layer of BareMinerals Illuminating mineral veil and Burt's Bee's balm. Most days, I don't have time to wear anything else, because my life is pretty crazy complicated right now. So the first picture is in unnatural light, and the second picture is facing my arcadia door with full sun exposure, just so we can see what lines I do or don't have in both lightings.  And I would like to go on record as saying, I'm not the biggest fan of these pictures, but I don't have all day to try and get ones I like better and they get the point across.

What I really like about her method is, once you've memorized it, you can do it anywhere.  Like say, in the car driving your kiddo to his therapy appointments. Yah, I totally don't care how crazy I look, for the record.  Or in the bathroom, or anywhere you've got a spare moment even if your life and your schedule is crazy ugly.  It's doable.  I don't always spend as much time on it as she recommends, because again, things are pretty challenging for me schedule wise.  But I definitely noticed a difference in the tautness and quality of my skin since I started using this.  And it was something I picked up because I'm not into doing invasive procedures, and I do enjoy looking and feeling the best I can for whatever stage of life I am in.

There is a supplemental skin care, short traditional yoga routine, and nutrition section on this.  Personally, I don't have time to make all natural skin products for myself, though I can understand and respect the benefits of them...it may be something you would be able to do for yourself more and I did find it interesting. I think she is also correct, the healthier you eat, the better your skin will look.  However, I personally am not into juicing.  As a person who successfully recovered from medication induced liver damage, I can tell you fructose is heavily processed by the liver, so I limit my fruit servings to one a day, and  I always have the whole piece, because the fiber helps a host of things, including regulating insulin response to the sugars in the fruit.  But if done in moderation for a person without my limitations, I don't have a problem with what she's saying about that.  Otherwise, I think her method is pretty stinking awesome, and it's something I totally love, and totally use.",1484611200,6,3417,4.356466876971608

8596249,5,B00DQAABZ0,"After searching for a natural way to ""lift"" my face, I came across a few of Danielle's facial exercises on the web.  I saved the site and tried them for a week before purchasing the dvd. I have felt more warmth and life in my face, and my wrinkles are softer.  The dvd offers many more exercises than I could find on the web, and I can take the dvd with me when I travel. I think she is just darling, and I respect her for pursuing a natural approach to healing herself.  Like all things, you must be diligent and patient to reap the rewards but I think it's worth it!",1461628800,8,568,4.053571428571429
