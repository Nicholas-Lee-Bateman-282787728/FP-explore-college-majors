After playing a few tough characters in the recent past, it is an easy outing for Jeeva, who has donned the role of a boy-next-door who has to toughen up due to circumstances. He amazes with his body language and his facial expressions. Jeeva has matured as an actor. Especially in the stunt sequences, he walks away with applause.

Giving him good company is Pooja. She has shaken her legs for pacy numbers, set to tunes by Dheena. The slim and cute-looking actor from Bangalore has played her part well as a TV journalist in the movie.

All credit goes to Subramaniam Siva for lacing the movie with good commercial elements. A mix of humour, romance and sentiment helps sustain the interest of the audience. A commercial entertainer sure to make front-benchers happy.",1300838400,,978,4.844311377245509
