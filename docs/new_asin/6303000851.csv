7834827,4,6303000851,"way too many negative reviews . seems like everyone is getting this movie mixed up with something else or comparing it to something else, this movie is for Miranda Otto connoisseurs who want to see her early work even though she's in there only few minutes here and there. nothing more nothing less. it's simple lowkey scifi / horror . if you're into bloody and gross effects or slasher stuff you not gonna like it. the story is mediocre. but it is quiet movie in every sense. unlike today's junk that are full of virtual shots, dark scenes and camera that's jumping all over the place and super loud annoying sounds to invoke irritation as a substitute for a good story or acting, this is simple light entertainment without giving you a headache and good acting for what it is.oh yeahyounger Michael Caton is also in this one of his earlier works.",1435795200,,848,4.5855263157894735
