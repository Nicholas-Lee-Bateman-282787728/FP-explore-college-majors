8211352,2,B000TXPXG4,"I never thought there would be a movie with the inefable Veronica Forque I would not like, but this is it.  characters do not speak but scream repetitious phrases such as: ""I'm unhappy"" several times in a row.  The whole thing is done fortissimo.  Acting is minimal, given that the characters are not allowed to develop but remain at the level of caricatures or stereotypes.  I have seen all of the actors involved in much better movies.  The material itself is weak.",1247097600,,467,4.646341463414634
