8194897,5,B000Q7ZKWA,"The quality of this cycle continue to impress. This is the French version of the opera which includes a ballet in the beginning of the third act. The setting is traditional in its best meaning, and direction, sets and costumes are the best I've seen on DVD/Bluray. The title role is sung by Leo Nucci, still in very good voice, combined with a deep insight into the role. The important role of Lady Macbeth is sung by Sylvie Valayre, who does a good job, although my favourite Lady continues to be Maria Zampieri in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-performance-from-Deutsche-Oper-Berlin/dp/B001PSVHJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a performance from Deutsche Oper Berlin</a>.

8194898,5,B000Q7ZKWA,"This was issued before on DVD by TDK in 2007 and reissued on DVD by ARTHAUS MUSIK in 2011. It was compiled from 6 performances given at Parma in October 2006. The blu-ray case has ""FILMED IN HIGH DEFINITION"", but the picture quality is no better than that of an average DVD from the period.

Nucci gives a superbly nuanced performance vocally, with tremendous urgency and pathos, suave timbre that he paints in different shades, no hint of fatigue, and more dramatic weight than most Macbeths today (it has now become customary to cast voices two sizes too small for the role). His singing is a lesson in style and legato.

Sylvie Valayre as Lady Macbeth has a huge dark voice perfectly suited in timbre to the role. The role requires a lot of qualities, and Valayre's voice checks all the boxes perfectly, with one small exception: the role requires quite a significant degree of agility, and Valayre has about 95% of it. There are 2 bars on ""retrocede"", right before Vieni, t'affretta, where the little notes are difficult for her to negotiate fast enough and she has to simplify the passagework here: she turns the four descending cascades into some kind of a simple descending scale.  These two rapid coloratura bars are placed right at the start of the role among dramatic, forceful declamations - it's Verdi's way of signaling the role's requirement to the singer right from the get-go. But this is a tiny part of the score, it isn't Norma, and such huge dramatic voices can pirouette vocally only so fast, so that cannot even register as a legitimate complaint. She sings a loud and perfectly secure high Db in Una macchia and even manages some of the trills in the Brindisi. All things considered, Ladies that are up to the task are very few and rare; most are just horrible but are cast anyway because the opera is popular.

Enrico Iori's Banco is significant in that...he looks like Freddie Mercury - I'm sorry, I just couldn't get over that. He gives a commanding, intense performance.

Roberto Iuliano (Macduff) sings his act IV romanza passionately and gracefully.

The camera work is rather basic and the editing follows a fixed formula. I mention it here because Nucci and Valayre need a more imaginative video direction - you do not want to watch them in close ups. This issue made the experience of watching this blu-ray unpleasant at times. When I watched the performance a second time I turned the TV off whenever the two leads were on because the visuals colored my perception of the vocal aspects negatively. The singers are body miked. What do you need body mikes for in a tiny house like Parma? I noticed that performances where the singers are body miked sound better on headphones. The advantage of good speakers over even the best headphones is the soundstage they provide, but body mics kill the soundstage anyway. Sound engineers deconstruct the sound to a gazillion tracks and reconstruct some artificial mix according to their skills, preferences and available time. With body mics the result is sterile. This is another example of the maxim that the more toys sound engineers have available to play with the worse the outcome.

The staging has spectators on the stage dressed in 1940's costumes, observing the entire opera unresponsive (some are mannequins). The cast is in 17th century costumes. Act I features a dwarf with a long tail that runs around Lady with a letter and later around her consort with a dagger. She enjoys abusing him - this quickly becomes tiresome. The witches are attractive washerwomen who put on fake beards when they engage in witchcraft but mostly manage without them. The ballet that is given complete hinges on their sexual exploits with male dancers - it doesn't rise above the level of a clich, but under Bruno Bartoletti baton the ballet sounds like great music. Liliana Cavani is an experienced and well-known film and opera director. Her ideas are not offensive, they are just ideas - they don't come together with any meaningful dramatic impact. Nevertheless, this Macbeth is vocally at least a good contender for the top among all available issues.",1358035200,10,4117,4.8229461756373935

8194900,5,B000Q7ZKWA,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He said it has fabulous acting on behalf of Nucci and is a wonderful production that uses Elizabethan costumes with avantgarde sets.,1356739200,,177,4.9
8194901,5,B000Q7ZKWA,This is an excellent presentation of Macbeth with 2 excellent singers I would love to hear in person now.  I am glad I bought this.,1335139200,,131,4.24
8194902,4,B000Q7ZKWA,"Macbeth is one of my favorite operas, and I own most of the released DVDs of this opera. This one is probably the one I enjoy the most. The sound is good, and the conducting, although not exceptional, is also satisfactory. The main singers, Nucci and Valayre, are outstanding. The production, a mixed hibrid of traditional (but with a slightly changed time) and modern (postwar audience sitting on stage) isn't so bad, although a little too simple. This production includes the ballet, which music I consider a plus. The last arias for each of the main characters (the sleep- walking scene and the ""Pieta, rispeto, onore"") are beautifully rendered by the singers and succesfully captured by the camera: both are really moving!
The other DVDs are dissapointing in some respect: The one with Guleghina has a mediocre conducting and sound, the one with Hampson has an ugly production, and even worst is the production with Bruson. The other I like is that from Glyndebourne, but it looks and sounds a little aged.

Esta es una excelente version de Macbeth. Muy superior a las otras disponibles en DVD, en calidad de sonido, interpretes y produccion. Incluye el ballet. Probablemente no es la ideal (la direccion de orquesta tiene sus pro y sus contras, y la produccion ha variado en algo la epoca y combina una vision tradicional con una vision moderna que tiene a un ""publico"" mas moderno observando la opera sobre el escenario, es decir todo ocurre dentro de lo que parece un teatro en ruinas), pero es lo mejor que hay. Vale la pena!",1185148800,19,1533,4.784905660377358
