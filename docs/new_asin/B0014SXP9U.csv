8548178,5,B0014SXP9U,I've been a long time fan of Lucy's and was fortunate enough to see her in Grease on Broadway. She has got an incredible voice and this is probably my favorite dvd of her concerts. The music works and the band is great too. I would highly recommend this to any Lucy/Xena fan. It's a must have as far as I'm concerned!,1355097600,,317,4.129032258064516
