7921761,1,B00004S5UJ,I must have read the ad wrong as it is in Italian and I don't speak Italian so I am unable to watch it. Guess I wasted my money and I' will have to learn to be more careful,1416700800,2,172,3.4358974358974357
7921762,1,B00004S5UJ,The DVD was in a format that my US DVD could not read.  In addition to that the jacket indicated that it was in Italian and had no english subtitles or dubbing.,1411084800,2,160,4.0
7921763,1,B00004S5UJ,"I was told that for review this purchase, I needed to say more. Well, here we go; I first saw Op Center by Tom Clancy , when it was first televised on TV as a 4 hour mini-series on NBC a few years back and then when it re-aired, I recorded it by vhs tape.
On 12/22/13 I ordered the dvd version , not realizing that it was dubbed in Italian. While I do not hold amazon responsible, I am of the opinion that the add was misleading.",1391904000,2,429,3.8863636363636362

7921765,5,B00004S5UJ,"I remember watching this when it was a miniseries on broadcast television in the mid-1990s.  Harry Hamlin (L.A. Law) plays Paul Hood, who is put in charge of a top-secret office that is charged with protecting the United States from threats around the world.  On his first day on the job (!), Soviet nuclear missiles are stolen by terrorists and are being moved out of the country through the Black Sea.

The miniseries was excellent; tense, believable and had me glued to my chair.  Great production values, and even a bit of humor (the team films the freighter moving the missiles by hiring a group of Turkish beauties to dance around on a yacht in bikinis; this gets the crew of the freighter all on deck so they and the boat can be filmed).  An amusing moment.

It's too bad this miniseries isn't on DVD and is currently unavailable even on videotape.  If you can find a copy, it's well worth viewing.  This would make a perfect video-on-demand program; no cost to press DVDs, yet readily available.

Five stars.  See if you can find it...

Update:  I did find a copy on video tape.  The quality isn't as good as it would be on DVD, but it's still a very enjoyable film.",1258588800,8,1174,4.481132075471698
