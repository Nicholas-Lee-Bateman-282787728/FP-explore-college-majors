The plot was boring.
Suggest you buy another dvd on Wesley",1486944000,,94,4.9375

8118190,5,B000F6ZEIM,"The first time I saw this film was in 1959 in Southern Africa. It made a great impression on me, the story of a preacher who was so devoted to sharing God's love for mankind that it changed a whole country's future. This film has been placed on DVD in its original version except for the slight colour addition. I am very pleased to now, after more than 30 years of searching, have it in my possesion. Those who put it on DVD did a good jobb.
I highly recommend it for those who are interested in church history and also for those interested in the history of England.",1231200000,8,568,4.220183486238532
