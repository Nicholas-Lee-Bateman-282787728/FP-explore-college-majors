7843444,3,6303314910,"This Chinese New Year VHS is pretty basic and in my opinion could have included more of the basics of Chinese New Year. They did do a good job but they skimmed over some things, talked about somethings that really aren't part of Chinese New Year like Tai Chi.

The local community center is going to celebrate Chinese New Year and has a host who walks you though information. There is an old 1975 circa footage of a Chinatown celebration of a dragon dancers out in the street and of a family greeting their elders and receiving their red envelopes. They do a quick review of the animals that represent each year but don't go into how the animals got their order. There really isn't much talk about new clothes, the Chinese New Year meal, dos and don't for New Year's day and how to prepare for Chinese New Year other than sweeping away from the door so you don't sweep out good luck. They do include a small story, not really sure it has anything to do with Chinese New Year and there is an art project  - a dragon using an paper molded egg carton, wooden sticks, construction paper and decorations. The dvd also features Mandarin Chinese and Spanish language tracks.

I found this at my local library but on a dvd, but sadly Amazon does not carry it on DVD and the 3 sellers here are being extremely greedy. Until Amazon decides to sell this I will give you the information on how to buy it for a lot less that the $999.95 they are offering for this outdated VHS version! They do not sell the dvds individually. You can purchase the entire 22 set of DVD's for a mere $[...].... and save yourself $[...] at [...] under Schlessinger Media!
