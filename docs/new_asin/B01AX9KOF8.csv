8748786,5,B01AX9KOF8,I own the VHS tapes of this Blu-Ray and have watched them before and just wanted a Blu_Ray Disc version of it. It was nice to have the original Voice actors do the parts again plus the special features were nice too!. I really didn't notice the parts they left out and thought it was just fine even though a number complained about the missing sections. All I have to say IS GET OVER IT! Good Classic JA finally on Blu-Ray!,1505433600,,423,4.234567901234568
8748787,1,B01AX9KOF8,Gunbuster is easily my favorite anime but this movie is just a badly edited version of the original OVA series that was only 6 episodes to begin with.  There is no new animation and the audio track/sound design while improved in some areas isn't as good as the original overall.  It's unfortunate that the OVA series is hard to find but I recommend tracking down a copy of the dvd which has the original audio track.,1480204800,4,416,4.4605263157894735
8748788,1,B01AX9KOF8,"I bought this expecting the Gunbuster series I watched 20 years ago, not realizing that this is just a 90-minute edit of the entire series. In this form the story makes no sense, character development isn't represented, and it's all a big zero. Time to track down my VHS copies from 1991.",1475798400,7,288,4.5576923076923075
8748789,3,B01AX9KOF8,"Want the pioneering Gunbuster series without all the annoying character development? Don't care why Noriko wears the headband or when she showed the first glimmers of fighting promise?  Don't care how Jung and Kazumi started off bad, but became friendly rivals?  Then this HEAVILY abridged compilation of Gunbuster fight scenes will suit you fine.

Seriously, this was the Gunbuster series with everything that made the series poignant deleted. The story marginally hangs together.

The sound and video quality were better than the standard DVD series compilation I bought on the same day. But why?  Nothing that would make you care about the characters or the world they live on still makes it into this rough cut.",1463616000,22,715,5.129310344827586
