8559591,5,B00AZFECZY,"I love this dvd! I only wish that i could've gotten it blu ray. All the blu rays come in all other regions except regional A. Regional A  is all american blu ray dvd players, but other than that, i watch this dvd everday. I would love to see all motogp, world superbike & TT Isle of man come in regional A blu ray dvds. I would buy them all!",1378598400,,341,3.8714285714285714
8559592,5,B00AZFECZY,I bought this because I was not able to watch last years races. I watched this and loved it. When you watch Moto GP there is not a lot of passing in an entire race watching it like this was a totally different experience don't watch this with friends around because every second something is happening and you don't want to miss it. My new favorite way to watch it. An entire season in 3 hours (no more wasting away Sundays for a boring race). I wish they showed a few slow motion (Zoomed) replays but nothing you can't achieve  with the Remote Control! Enjoy the season of 2012-13 and great enough season to watch more than once.....,1377648000,,634,4.372881355932203
8559593,5,B00AZFECZY,"Hey, its MotoGP - the best spectator sport on the planet and this DVD does a fantastic job (as it does year after year) at capturing the excitement of the sport.  The only downside is that there isn't more coverage.  Well worth the price for real fans!",1371772800,2,252,4.340425531914893
8559594,4,B00AZFECZY,I love MotoGP reviews.  The action is incredible. Over the year MotoGP reviews seem to get more compact.  I miss the longer intro's to each race and the longer post race interviews of previous years.,1369958400,2,199,4.6571428571428575
8559595,4,B00AZFECZY,I liked it a lot. I'm a big Moto GP fan. My only wish is that the discs showed the entire race.,1368403200,2,95,3.3636363636363638
8559596,5,B00AZFECZY,"2012 was the first year of the 1000cc MotoGP bikes, as well as the introduction of the CRT bikes.  All 18 races are here, from the start under the lights in Qatar to the finish in Valencia.  Great racing, on-board coverage, crashes, passes and all the drama that is MotoGP!",1366848000,5,273,4.44
