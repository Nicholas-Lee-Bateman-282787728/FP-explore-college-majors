8375718,4,B000009MY5,"Written by Wong Kar-wai and directed by one of the masters of Hong Kong New Wave, featuring Tsui hark as actor, a truly overlooked gem: a comedy with bitter and violent tones set beetwen the neons and the underworld of  Mongkok. Tsang stars as a nerd who has to keep care of the lovers of his  brother meanwhile he's in prison. Tam has a very personal visual style, and  the plot has unpredictable twist. If you like Stanley Kwan, Wong Kar-wai  and Ann Hui (or Godard and Rohmer), buy it.",933638400,3,488,4.388888888888889
