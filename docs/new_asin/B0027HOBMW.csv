3867505,5,B0027HOBMW,"This was excellent. It was a well written story without jumping around from scene to scene and losing focus. it flowed very well and keeps your attention.  It was awesome to hear everyone rapping in the film. Meiki Phifer- got skills, Omar Epps-skills, even Faizon Got skills. Im impressed with the entire cast and the film. Good Job Sticky! looking for part II! whats up?",1341532800,,372,4.723076923076923
3867506,5,B0027HOBMW,"If you love Hip Hop, then this is the movie for you! I was surprised that there was rapping throughout the whole movie. The lyrics and beats are great and the story line was very interesting. It is kind of hard to believe all of the events happened in one day, but it's still a great movie. I give it 10 stars!",1310342400,3,310,4.016129032258065
3867507,1,B0027HOBMW,This movie was terrible. It should be a rap video because they rapped their lines throughout the whole movie. I would not reccomend this movie to my worst enemy!!,1282694400,,162,4.620689655172414
3867508,5,B0027HOBMW,"Wow!
This movie was really different from what i thought it would be.
""Sticky Fingaz"" did it up. The casting was off the chain.
He definitley let alot of big actors get their shine on in this movie.
I think that the storyline an the acting was very unique. The movie is a MUST SEE.",1269648000,2,281,4.127272727272727
3867509,5,B0027HOBMW,"I remember seeing a Hip Hopera called Carmen that starred Beyonce and Mekhi Phifer and thought this movie would be something like that. And I wasn't too thrilled about Carmen however it was allright. But this movie right here was a BANGER! I'm a hip hop purist and I'm kind of hard when it comes to critiquing the hip hop Culture because it has gotten watered down to the Max. However if you like Hip Hop, action, and a  feel of real hip hop music then this is the movie to see. I thought this guy's career was finished (Sticky Fingas). But the scenes and the plots were put together in a most professional way. Who would have thought Sticky Fingas could put something together like this. This is a true thirsty hood professionally put together Hip Hop masterpiece right here. A must see.",1262563200,3,788,4.472222222222222
3867510,3,B0027HOBMW,"LOL, This DVD had so many well known African American. I like the plot, but all that singing and rapping, when they should have being speaking. That's why I have LOL, it was funny that they made it that way. Now, my son that raps, enjoy this DVD. He stated they just rapping how it is. Its like one mans point of view, but laid out by many others. The making was not that bad. It didn't look like a home video, now the parts with killing and blood, was not that seen in a movie for the Big screen.
I gave it an three,being I paid for it and that was really because they had our nice looking brothers doing what they do. My son,he said an 4, so i guess its half way.",1261180800,,665,3.933333333333333
3867511,5,B0027HOBMW,"Very creative,innovative & well done....the plot story line & cast is fantastic,if you love hip hop you'll love this & if you don't you should be able to appreciate the creativity. Sticky did a great job directing this, Mekhi Phifer,Thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=tag_rvc_rv_ihlp_wt?ie=UTF8&nodeId=16238571rech,Omar Epps & Clarence Williams were fantastic !!",1252713600,,384,7.191489361702128
3867512,4,B0027HOBMW,"A DAY IN THE LIFE IS A DIFFERENT MOVIE, BECAUSE ITS THE FIRST MOVIE I EVER SAW WERE THE ACTORS RAP THE WHOLE MOVIE. BUT EVERTHING FALLS TOGETHER NICELY WITH THE STORY LINE AND THE RAPPING.  I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS INTERESTINGA ND KEPT MY ATTENTION THE WHOLE WAY THRU.  WORTH CHECKIN OUT",1252368000,3,286,4.377358490566038
3867513,5,B0027HOBMW,"this movie actually makes more sense than black cinema movies that don't have any rappin at all!! lol. sticky fingaz is really a genius for this one. he makes it easy for you to follow the story as you listen to each person rap and it doesnt get tiring listening to them rap for 90 min straight. i am a huge hip hop fan but i still was skeptical about this when i first heard it was coming. we all know stick can rap really good but idk about how a movie would turn out with all that going on. a great success with a lot of a list actors. omar epps, mekhi phifer, clarence williams 3, bokime woodbine, michael rappaport,faizon love, and of course rappers like fredro, treach, kurupt, tash, and even ray j. really good movie i was entertained and i usually don't like watching a lot of the low budget black cinimea movies.",1248825600,5,821,4.269230769230769
3867514,4,B0027HOBMW,"I thought the movie was very good. It was true to hip hop and the lyrics were top notch and on point. The only bad thing I can say about the movie is that I cant see the events that transpire in the movie all happening in one day before dusk. It just didn't make any since. Other than that I would definatly call it a true to real hip hop film. Big ups to Kirk ""Sticky Fingerz"" Jones.",1246665600,5,384,3.8734177215189876
