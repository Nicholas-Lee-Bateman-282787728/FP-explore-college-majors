7963386,5,B000067IZL,This was a GREAT movie! A LOT of action kept you on your seat! Really enjoyed it!,1481328000,,81,3.823529411764706
7963387,2,B000067IZL,"Ron Perlman is head of a cult that obtains a biological agent in a bank vault. Meanwhile a bank robbery is going on while the SWAT team is there too. This results in a three way shooting with automatic weapons and few casualties. A major earthquake hits LA and the three groups go at each other in the rubble of a building. Oh yea, there is an elevator shaft. Wolf Larson plays the good guy who manages to survive because he shoots from the open with a pistol against guys with full autos hiding behind something.  A lot of been there, done that action. Perlman couldn't make it work.

Guide: F-bomB, N-word. No sex or nudity. Playboy Playmate of the Month July 1989 Erika Eleniak provides some eye candy.",1421971200,2,705,4.457364341085271
7963388,5,B000067IZL,Wolf Larson and Ron Perlman did a awesome job in there roles  like the action and the movie altogether watch again,1395187200,,114,4.428571428571429
7963389,3,B000067IZL,"An average tv movie quality, totally formula story of religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good ""I'm not just the President of 'Psychos R Us,' I'm also a client"")who gets control of a biochemical virus (think the virus from the movie ""The Rock""). Too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with the government agents trying to stop him (led by the impressively physiqued, mildly entertaining Wolf Larson, backed by Fred Dryer) along with the standard ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" spunky female (the forever bland Erika Eleniak) and ""lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute"" male (Brandon Karrer). Has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic (wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous). Basically a decent rainy day movie.

Favorite line, spoken by Ron Perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in Erika Eleniak's cleavage: ""A woman and her mystery.""",1104278400,,973,4.723529411764706
7963390,4,B000067IZL,"Director Brian Katkin delivers an over the top action thriller, that not only has a devastating earthquake, but a bank robbery and a mad religious fanatic set to release the deadly Pandora virus on the world because his son was killed in an FBI raid.  While the CGI earthquake effects are far from great, the movie's fierce pacing and some neat performances from Ron Perlman, Erika Eleniak and Wolf Larson combine to make this a lot better than it should have been.  There's so much chaos going on it's hard to keep up with.  What's really ""amusing"" is that even after the earthquake all but levels the bank, the robbers, SWAT team and terrorists continue shooting like nothing happened.

Far-fetched and implausible, SHAKEDOWN nevertheless delivers an earthshattering experience!",1097107200,4,780,5.0703125
7963391,2,B000067IZL,"Welcome to B-movieland!! For that's what Shakedown unfortunately turns out to be. Billed as a disaster/bank heist/raving loony-type-terrorist kindova of movie, poor Shakedown doesn't really succeed at being anything at the end of the day but a bit of a mish-mash.
The cast isn't bad though, with a nice well-rounded performance by the good-humoured Wolf Larsen and Erika Eleniak doing her best to keep up, the action trips along very nicely, thank you very much.
But the real star of the movie is Ron Perlman, whose scene-chewing performance as the deadly-dangerous religious nut St Joy steals every scene he is in. In a part that could be hammed to death, Perlman plays it straight - and turns in a creepy, chilling performance that is waaaaay too good for a film like this. If the producers could have put him in every scene the result would have been a godsend in a film full of stock footage and very shaky (if you'll excuse the pun) CGI work.
But if you like lots of maniacal gunfire, a nonsensical plot and some pretty personable acting, then Shakedown may just be the film for you.",1026518400,9,1088,4.701570680628272
