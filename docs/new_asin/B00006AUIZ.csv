7966559,5,B00006AUIZ,"This is a great video for teaching stereotypes. I use it in my 7th grade classroom. At first, it seemed extremely corny. However, the overall message is fantastic, and it seemed to really hit home with the kids.",1359849600,,211,4.578947368421052
7966560,4,B00006AUIZ,"My 8th grade Computer Technology class did a unit of study on Stereotype.  We used the video ""The Unforgettable Pen Pal"" because this video helped them to see how people stereotype others with a disability.  They liked the video, however, in their words they said ""we get the message but this video is too elementary.""  The video is an excellent informative video, but I really wished I could have found a video delivering the same message but on the level of an 8th grader.",1301616000,,474,4.619047619047619
7966561,5,B00006AUIZ,This is my favorite Human Race Club video.  It teaches children to accept differences and not to be judgemental.  I purchased it for my children and for my son's teacher to show the class.  All of the Human Race Club videos are fantastic!,1190851200,3,238,4.488372093023256
