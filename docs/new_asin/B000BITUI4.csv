2420099,5,B000BITUI4,"I love this documentary and have watched it several times. Not only is it a very interesting story but the way it is told is amazing, Ken Burns is the best.",1470787200,,156,4.064516129032258
2420100,4,B000BITUI4,"This was good enough that after checking it out and viewing it from the library, I decided I wanted a copy of my own.  Like many Ken Burns pieces, it tends to be moody.  Mark Twain's life has so many sad periods in it, that this adds a certain melancholy to the film as well.  But it's really worth seeing.  I had never thought about the social significance of Huckleberry Finn's story and was impressed by the way the film discussed it.  Not all those who are show commenting on Twain's life are as articulate as they might have been.  The film also brought out the ambiguity of his choice of Mark Twain as a pen name.  In school I'd heard about it being a piloting term for riverboats, but hadn't thought about the rest of it.  I think a lot of people today are at that point where the waters become safe, and where they also become hazardous.",1465689600,,845,4.270440251572327
2420101,5,B000BITUI4,It was a great story of Mark Twain--from his beginning to his end,1463875200,,65,4.076923076923077
2420102,5,B000BITUI4,same movie as in Hannibal home...didn't have time to watch it there....so bought it....they were out of them to sell....,1462320000,,120,5.05
2420103,1,B000BITUI4,"The subject area of Ken Burnss documentaries appeals to an audience which tends to be disproportionately old. Millennials simply do not care as much about Mark Twain, or the Roosevelt dynasty, or baseball players of the Depression era, as seniors do. And many seniors have reached an age where clearly hearing and understanding all of the words spoken by a narrator may be difficult, especially when they must be heard over a relentless carpet of sound effects and music. Could Burns and those who assist him afford to subtitle their many documentaries? Oh, my, yes: just look at the dazzlingly list of the better angels who underwrite the extensive series. But there are no subtitles, presumably because nothing visually should detract from the prettiness of everything presented on-screen. White lettering at the bottom of the Burns documentary would be like crayon graffiti on a Rembrandt painting.

There are very extended passages in all Burns documentaries where the same mind-numbing, vigorous jazz music, or hoedown music, or ragtime music is repeated in an endless loop. Such music, which is in the public domain, is free to the filmmakers, and they beat it to death. (And often the recordings used are ancient, scratchy, and terribly low-fidelity.) At such times I would love to turn the music completely off and simply read what is being spoken. But without subtitles, it's impossible.

If there were subtitles for the Twain documentary, Id give it as many stars as there are in the heavens.",1461024000,,1502,5.05241935483871

2420144,5,B000BITUI4,"As a Ph. D in Literature whose dissertation was on Mark Twain, I can heartily recommend this film.  The photographs used in the film are exquisite and the presentation is superb!  Anyone (and this should be everyone as far as I'm concerned) who wants to get a deeper understanding of the ""Lincoln of our literature"" would be well served to view this film. Burns meets his usual standard of excellence with this film.",1410998400,,416,4.684931506849315
2420145,5,B000BITUI4,"Without television, radio, blogs, websites, etc., an entire nation came to know and love this man. Extraordinary! Ken Burns has done it again, and 100 years later we can come to understand why Twain is still read, quoted and loved.",1410825600,,231,4.8

2420152,5,B000BITUI4,One of the BEST done on Twain. A pleasure to watch and revealing as to his dark side.,1409270400,,85,3.7777777777777777
2420153,4,B000BITUI4,Interesting understanding of how big Mark Twain was in his day; leading the push for American throughout the world with the down home stories like Tom Sawyer.  A confirmation in here that Huck Finn was regarded as his best work - as it was significant to me.,1408924800,,258,4.48936170212766
2420154,5,B000BITUI4,"I have always thought Mark Twain had an interesting life but this puts it all into perspective, I was amazed at how he had it all, he thought, and how he lost it all. Very enjoyable life story, I will watch it again just to remind myself  ""stuff means nothing"".",1408752000,,261,4.22
2420155,5,B000BITUI4,This is an excellent film portraying Mark Twain's life with numerous quotations and interviews that provides an understanding of his life and the hardships he faced.,1407801600,,165,5.384615384615385
2420156,5,B000BITUI4,PBS did a great job on this one.,1406592000,,32,3.125
2420157,5,B000BITUI4,We loved it,1404950400,,11,3.0
2420158,5,B000BITUI4,A Ken Burns' production never disappoints! In this documentary he provides a beautiful representation of the life of Samuel Clemens.,1398124800,,132,5.65
2420159,5,B000BITUI4,"National treasures have become very hard to address properly- maybe it has all been done before.  That Ken Burns touch, though, makes a great little film. I wrote a thesis on this all-American icon, but the Burns film still brought inspired laughter and tears; a poignant telling. It would be a bargain at twice the price.",1392940800,,322,4.75
2420160,5,B000BITUI4,"I guess Ken Burns can't make a bad film. Areas I was never that interested in (Jazz) were eye catching, attention grabbing and amazing. I was interested in Twain and was even more enthralled than I expected.",1391126400,,207,4.621621621621622
2420161,5,B000BITUI4,"Of course, directed by Ken Burns it would be excellent. But this biography was expertly done and a fascinating look into the life of this legendary character and writer.",1390694400,,169,4.862068965517241
2420162,5,B000BITUI4,"In less than 4 hours, Ken Burns was able to capture the heart and soul of an incredibly complex man. After watching this, I felt like I knew Mark Twain as if he was my favorite uncle!",1389052800,,183,3.972972972972973
2420163,5,B000BITUI4,"Ken Burns has produced another engaging documentary. This work does real justice to Twain presenting him as a real, believable person. Burns provides a touching look at the life of Mark Twain without being sentimental.",1383868800,,218,5.257142857142857
2420164,5,B000BITUI4,Fantastic!!!  Anyone who loves Twain needs this. Great for English teachers.  Saw Hal Holbrook and he was great at Twain.,1383177600,,121,5.0
2420165,5,B000BITUI4,"Mark Twain was surely the ""voice of America"" in his time, and has barely relinquished that role now, 100+ years after his death. While taking a Mark Twain course at Stanford University in 2010, I decided to learn as much as I could about this most beloved author by reading all his novels, most of his essays, his recently published autobiography and other works. I even attended a ""Mark Twain Live"" performance by Hal Holbrook, who has been channeling Twain for over 50 years. But the single most useful source was the film directed by Ken Burns. In his usual thorough manner, Ken Burns and crew set about to document the life and accomplishments of Mark Twain, embellished in the Burns trademark style with hundreds of photographs, maps, journal entries, readings and even a few rudimentary film clips.

No aspect of Samuel Clemens' life was omitted from this documentary - his family and relationships, the early death of his daughter, his failed businesses, and his travels throughout Europe. Though we think of him as a commentator and author able to find the humor in anything, he faced great sadness in his life, facing financial ruin several times and outliving his wife and 3 of his 4 children.

Burns' trademark style of panning over still photographs makes the presentation more dynamic than could normally be expected from what is essentially a slide show. The narrator does an excellent job as well. I highly recommend this film for anyone with even a passing interest in America's (and one of the world's) favorite authors.",1379548800,,1537,4.885057471264368
2420166,5,B000BITUI4,"After seeing the Burns film on PBS purchased it for my sister's birthday and also Huck Finn, which becomes much more understandable after watching the film.",1378512000,,156,5.038461538461538
2420167,5,B000BITUI4,"Ken Burns did a great job.  There were film clips, but most were photos, taking you on a journey in the life of Mark Twain.  Burns kept it moving and Mark Twain kept going against all odds, becoming the best loved author of the time.  He had such wit and humor, that newspapers wanted quotes from him about big news of the time.  He was well known around the world, and he was never disappointing.  He had his life of ups and downs, and rebounded each time with remarkable strength.",1371513600,,482,4.311111111111111
2420168,5,B000BITUI4,I bought this DVD for my son-in-law and he love it.  I recommend highly to others. It is good DVD to get to know about Mark Twain.,1371340800,,130,3.814814814814815
2420169,5,B000BITUI4,This in no exception. Lots of family photos and details about his life. I found it best to play a few times over to catch what I missed when distracted by interruptions.,1370908800,,169,4.3125
2420170,4,B000BITUI4,Film is about 5 hours long!  I had it on video and could ff to the sections I wanted to show to my Am Lit class.  I wish the DVD had a program guide included so I could jump to different tracks to show what I need.,1368489600,,214,3.5319148936170213
2420171,5,B000BITUI4,"Even if you don't love Mark Twain's books, you'll enjoy this full, beautifully written and produced documentary about his life and times.

Mark Twain's relationships with black people is explored in depth; how wonderful to learn that, indirectly, Mark Twain was responsible for Thurgood Marshall. And hearing the story of the ex-slave in her own words, ""transcribed,"" as Twain told William Dean Howells, is moving beyond language to tell.

Have a handkerchief at the ready. Few men have endured as many personal losses as Mark Twain and emerged as strong and clear-sighted as he did.",1365638400,,583,5.126315789473685
2420172,5,B000BITUI4,"I actually saw some footage from this DVD when I visited the Mark Twain House in Hartford, CT. It was absolutely fascinating to learn of Twain's love for Hartford, the seat of creative writers and publishers in the period. The film does a great job of presenting Twain, a many-faceted individual, within the context of his era.  I plan on using this film to introduce Twain to my American literature class.",1364947200,,406,4.71830985915493
2420173,5,B000BITUI4,I always enjoy Ken Burns.  He manages to entertain as well as inform.  I like that he uses a variety of speakers and gives information without opinion.,1362268800,,151,4.555555555555555
2420174,5,B000BITUI4,Mark Twain interest is great in this community. He summered here and married a girl here. He is buried here.,1361836800,,108,4.45
2420175,5,B000BITUI4,"This documentary is nothing short of a masterpiece, covering the highs and lows of Mark Twain's career, as he becomes one of America's most important literary figures. It's a riveting look into the life of a genius who changed the landscape of writing and those in his life that influenced his work, that is both insightful and moving.",1360972800,,335,4.793103448275862
2420176,5,B000BITUI4,"First, it's a Ken Burns film, so you know it's very high quality, finely researched and presented;
Secondly, it's Ken Burns on Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens being one of the greatest and most influential Americans, ever.

You hear mark Twain; you see Mark Twain; you know Mark Twain; and feel you've met the man.",1358380800,,309,4.722222222222222

2420178,5,B000BITUI4,"This is the finest gathering of the details behind one of the most famous writers in American History. Anyone that enjoys great writing, funny stories and insight as to the human condition in this land and beyond must see this great works.",1356393600,,239,4.714285714285714
2420179,5,B000BITUI4,"The disc is misleading.  On side A it shows both Side A and Side B info on the center ring, but if you flip the disc over, nothing is written in the center ring.  But Part One is on side A and Part Two is on side B.  Please disregard the poorly rated reviews based on this.

But to the actual documentary.  It's about 210 minutes and actually features some amazing content by the scholars and playwrights (Arthur Miller is featured quite a bit).  Of all the Ken Burns documentaries, this one I felt had the best collection of experts compared to the length of the feature.  Of course The War is in a different league.

Mark Twain is often read, oft quoted (The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated). But we really don't get too deeply into his personal life, and what a life he had!  This amazing man traveled extensively, went from rags to riches, to nearly broke several over his life.  He had a loving family but a family life that was filled with tragedy and heartache.  He resented slavery and was an advocate for equality.

Ken Burns puts his masterful touch on this documentary.  It is a bit shorter than Lewis and Clark and The War, but it never feels too short or too long.  You will probably smile quite a bit, and hopefully this will leave you with a finer appreciation of Twain, not just as an author, but as a human being as well.",1345248000,,1356,4.329365079365079
2420180,4,B000BITUI4,"This is a documentary put together by PBS, and apparently ran two nights. It is almost four hours long and covers two sides of a DVD. It is worth every minute.

You get the usual talking heads, although some of them are genuinely interesting, especially Hal Holbrook, who played Mark Twain so successfully on the stage for so many years in a one-man show he called ""Mark Twain Tonight!"" Then there are some big-name writers and scholars, and they really do speak English, not Academia. Mostly.

This is a biography, but it is specifically a time-line of his writings and what was going on in his life when he wrote each of the works. We all know that he took his pen name from the two fathom mark for the depth of the Mississippi River that marked the line between safe water and dangerous water. One of the commentators points out that Twain spent most of his life living on that edge between what was safe and what was dangerous. We Missourians know, of course, that he grew up in Hannibal, but I had not known before this that he was not actually born in Hannibal, but in a very tiny town nearby. He acknowledged that the character of Tom Sawyer was largely himself when he was a boy, and Huck Finn was drawn from his best friend at that time.

Oddly enough for someone I know primarily as a cynic and finally an atheist, he was married to a very pious woman. They loved each other dearly, and he made a good-faith effort to be a Christian for her sake. They built a marvelous big house in Hartford, Connecticut, and raised three daughters. Their first-born, a son, died in infancy. They were completely happy for some time, but Twain invested in all sorts of things that lost money, his lifestyle was lavish, and eventually he fell deeply into debt. Twain declared bankruptcy, but a financier friend helped them save the house and his intellectual property rights, and Twain vowed he would pay back every penny to his creditors, although he was not legally bound to do so.

Finally, they decided to do a tour of Europe and eventually around the world, where Twain lectured to packed houses. They loved him. The oldest daughter went with her parents, while the two younger ones stayed in the US with relatives. I believe he ended up getting two books out of their experiences, but certainly one: Following the Equator.

But then the middle daughter, Suzy, fell sick and died back in Connecticut. They went home for awhile, and Clara married. But Twain's wife's health began to fail, and her doctor recommended they go back to Florence, where the climate was better for her.

Without following all the details, I will just say that Twain suffered one loss after another, both personal and financial, and seemed only to be happy when he was in the limelight. He became known for his liberal opinions, his biting wit with regard to politics and religion, as well as on humanity and our foibles. He hated slavery, racism and antisemitism, and poked fun at the fat cats who exploited people without regard for their dignity and their rights.

His entire story is told in thousands of photographs, and it is clear to see that he loved the camera. Indeed, Edison even did a short film of him toward the end of his life. Most of us have read several of his works, especially the fiction, but I am very happy to have finally bought several of the non-fiction books.",1336867200,,3359,4.569767441860465

In this case, the marketing department of PBS who neglect to put on the outer packaging that this is simply PART ONE. My wife, who saw all of the episodes on PBS, says it cuts off after the publication of HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which leaves enough material for a second disc.

So when do you find out this is only part one? AFTER you've inserted the disc and see the main menu. There, it clearly states PART ONE, by which time you've already bought it and are on the hook for PART TWO, to appear at some time in the future for an additional cost, of course.

So, basically, you've bought this thinking that it's the entire PBS episodes, and it's not.

Depending on how PBS edits it for DVD release, there's going to be a PART TWO, and maybe a PART THREE, and who knows what else?

Note to Ken Burns: Either issue something like this all together on one disc or two discs and price it accordingly, or LET PEOPLE KNOW they are buying it unknowingly on the installment plan. I don't think it's Ken's fault; he's a good guy and a straight shooter. You can squarely place the blame on PBS.

2420186,4,B000BITUI4,"Ken Burns has established a fine reputation for the illustrated biography or history. This production features the life of Mark Twain as it might be set in the sights and locations of his life. The photographs and illustrations carry the story while we are informed and entertained by the narrative that accompanies them. So we get to both see the places and people of that actual time and to hear the authentic voices of Twain and his contemporaries.
Twain was,more than anything else,a wisecracker. He dealt with the world around him by bringing out its humorous side. However,the picture that emerges from this documentary is a fully rounded person,who suffered his fair share of human sadness. By the end of the program,we feel that we have come to know more than just the comic Twain. Among his trials was the loss of a beloved child and he also had to deal with the business side of life,not a sphere in which he did very well.
This program conveys richly the lives of main stream Americans in the 19th century. Burns gives us a clear sense of what it was like to grow up along the mighty Mississippi. Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer and all the rest of Twain's gang of characters are located realistically in the world they convey so well in the books.
Ken Burns is the master of this kind of photographic presentation and his film is a purchase that will have you going back again and again to recapture that fabled world. Unlike many other DVDs that you might buy,this one is a treasure for life.",1265414400,,1498,4.5724907063197024
2420187,5,B000BITUI4,"No one I know can tell a story as powerfully and movingly as Ken Burns. This biography on Mark Twain was not only entertaining, it was a rare look at a man of genius who reached the pinnacle of success as an author who created unforgettable characters and a fearless social critic who used his humor and razor sharp wit to expose the hypocrisies of his day. He delighted millions the world over with his observations on human behavior, delivered with great humor, and left the world with countless sayings which are quoted to this day. Despite his great success, he also suffered disastrous defeats and crushing tradgedy. This is a riveting story of a brilliant, complex and very human man whose social comment is as relevant today as it was in his day. Utterly fascinating.",1253750400,,774,4.698529411764706
2420188,5,B000BITUI4,"No, this will not be a paean to the `transformative' nature of reading Samuel Clemens' (hereafter Mark Twain) seminal works, ""Huckleberry Finn"" and ""Tom Sawyer"" in childhood. I spend no long nights reading his works under a blanket, flashlight at the ready, until I fell asleep exhausted. (I did do that form of reading but not for Mr. Twain's work.) I, frankly, could not relate to the characters and the dialogue that seemed rather stilted (although I would not have known enough to call it that then). I do admit to having built a raft to try to `escape', along with my brothers, from some unfair sentence imposed my parents for some childhood transgression. But that can hardly be lain at Mr. Twain's door.

Nor will this review be a homage to Twain's treasure chest of humor and witty sayings that are sprinkled through out this documentary, and that have become part of the common language (and were, in the old days, very quotable newspaper filler). This film only reinforced the notion, other than the famous ditty about his response to the premature announcement of his death and his comment about San Francisco in August, that I did not find his humor funny. That said, after viewing this fine almost four hour Ken Burns PBS documentary I will admit to an on-going curiosity about this, arguably, first great modern American writer. Hey, I said Mark Twain didn't ""speak"" to me. I know that he is a great writer, and I think I sensed that notion even as a kid.

Ken Burns is probably the latter day master of the educational film documentary, most famously, and justly so, from the time of his ten-part PBS ""Civil War"" epic that I can still take in with my mind's eye. To a lesser degree, but with the same close attention to detail, a fine eye for selecting just the right photograph to make his point and appropriate musical scores in the background (including many variations of Stephan Foster songs that give a feel to the ""gilded age"" in which Twain lived and to which he added his own imprint).

Here Burns goes through the obligatory life of the author, starting from the rough and tumble days in Missouri and on the Mississippi River, on through to the fits and starts of finding a niche for himself (and a job) in the American literary market to success, fleeting as that was at times, and the fame, fortune, and in the end misfortune that went with that final acknowledgement that he was the premier literary man and storyteller of his times. The heart of this exploration of Twain's life, and what made it intriguing for a skeptical non-literary man like me was the way in which Twain was portrayed as a representative man of his age. That included both in his appetites for success, financial and otherwise, and to be, and be seen, as a successful product of the rough and tumble democratic American social system of the time. No small part of that persona is attributed to his wife and family that seemed, through thick and thin, hard times and good, to be his anchor. Not every successful writer has had that stable foundation but Twain literally thrived on it.

This film spend some time on Twain's literary production, his methods of work, his witticisms and his successful career as a public storyteller. I need not detail that information here. I would only say this-those who argue that Twain was first great American writer certainly have the best of the argument. In retrospect I can see where my own favorite from the 19th century, Nathaniel Hawthorne, really was not writing for the great democratic masses beginning their long search for some cultural expression to which they could relate. Twain, for literary and financial reasons, was trying to reach that audience.

Finally, and here is where Mark Twain gets high marks from this reviewer, as the documentary pointedly highlights on many ocassions. Twain positioned himself as a truth-telling about the inequities of the world, the absurdities of racism and its cultural expressions and about the foolhardiness of the upcoming rise of the American empire that he was, in the end, helpless to stop. That he did so while feting kings and queens, the rich and famous and liking such activities points out the contradictions of his life as a man. A contradiction that more than one American would-be radical had faced unsuccessfully. But here is a home truth. We can always use an extra truth-teller or two, a rather rare commodity in any age. We can sort out Twain's contradictions from there. Twain devotee, or not, this documentary is worth four hours of your time.",1246147200,,4551,4.755696202531645
2420189,5,B000BITUI4,"Ken Burns 3 and half biography is a masterpiece in bring the life of Mark Twain to life. Full of humor and insights into the life of America's greatest author. The story is full of Mark Twain's axioms and wisdom on life. This in itself makes it worth the price of the tape - In my opinion, Twain's humor and sayings are even greater tan the old master of Ben Franklin.

  The biography is not only laughs and humor, but there is also a considerable amount of commentary on Huck FInn (About 30 minutes). The insights on his works outside of Huck FInn are also enlightening - Tom Sawyer, Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Pudd'nhead Wilson, and Innocence Abroad... all add interesting perspective on Twain life and his place in literary history.

 Twain's/Clemens' life was fascinating - his rise and fall the humor and the tragedy. His life was as eclectic as his writings. He was everything from a steamboat captain to a correspondent in Hawaii. Twain traveled the world giving lectures and was a true ambassador to middle american life. All of this presented in a tight poignant tale by Ken Burns - great viewing.

Final Verdict - A must for fans of Mark Twain and everyone who is a fan of American Literary History.  Ken Burns does a outstanding job in tying Twain early life into his works and shows how his lack of business acumen ruined him.

If you don't care about Mark Twain, this probably won't capture your attention, but if you have read Twain and are a fan of him, as I am, this bio will do a great job of putting Twain's works into the context of a life that was remarkable in so many ways. The thing I most learned from this that I didn't know before had to do with the extent to which Twain's life was marked by personal tragedy, and thinking through the extent to which the appeal of his material is because it is comedy that is not glibly funny, but is marked by the gravitas of someone who knows life is hard.

2420194,5,B000BITUI4,"At least as good as Burns' other, more heralded works, the concision and love with which Twain's life are here presented make this a true masterpiece. If your local library doesn't have it, make them get it; every school and library in the land should have this at the front of their dvd collection.

  If ever there was doubt as to Twain's status as one of the finest and most quintessentially American of American artists, it is laid to rest here. A stunningly tragic life filled with triumphant humor and wisdom is given gorgeous tribute; the deep and almost transcendant love of the interviewees for Twain is especially striking.

  Burns' pet technique of panning over still photos is tailor-made for this story and era. I'm not sure if it was thinking of my deep childhood love of Twain's books or just how moving his life was, but I found myself crying more during these four hours than any other movie I can recall. By the tenth deluge I had to laugh and realize that this is the best biographical film I have ever seen.

  If you love Twain's writing, you will be amazed at the sadness he lived through while writing some of the funniest words ever penned. Even if you've never read any Twain, you will marvel at the life he lived, and the strength he showed in the face of one tragedy after another.

  This is the American Spirit writ large. Not the bs version sold on tv, but the truly intelligent, open-hearted, adventurous, pioneering spirit that has become so rare.

  If only we could find a man of this depth today and make him president.

I can almost hear Sam Clemens laughing at the thought right now...",1183420800,,1623,4.544827586206897
2420195,5,B000BITUI4,"To be sure, I am a student of literature and a fan of Mark Twain, but I had no idea, none whatsoever(!), of what a rich and inspiring life he lived. He was a comic genius as well as a man devastated by continual heartbreak.
I have always known PBS to do a wonderful job with their specials, and I have admired Ken Burns since the day I first discovered his work on the women's movement i.e. the Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton story (highly recommended as well!)...but in their retelling of Mark Twain's life, these two forces have outdone themselves.
From now on I will always think of Samuel Clemens as an intrinsic part of what we call Americana. Forget baseball and apple pie, Twain and his writings are (or should be) the true American pastime.
I have watched many biographies of American authors but none come close to this, NONE. My favorite author of all time is F. Scott Fitzgerald and not one of his many audio visual biographies can touch the completeness and depth that has been carefully devoted here to Twain. In the 3+ hours of this presentation I laughed outloud, and was moved to tears, outraged, entertained, and educated by this telling of Twain's life. There is no way it could be better or more complete and I defy any lover of Twain, or literature in general, to feel differently.

2420196,5,B000BITUI4,"Being still a young man, 21, I can vividly remember my high school days, and my hateful relationship with the ""dreadfully boring"" Huckleberry Finn.

Cue, years later, my revived interest in literature.  I pick up a handful of Kurt Vonnegut's work and absolutely fall in love.  I then see, in Palm Sunday, his essay on Twain.  I figure, ""If he likes him so, I should give the old guy another try.""

And I did, and I couldn't have been more glad.

I picked up Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn one night and shot through them like a train through a piece of paper.  A new admiration and intense respect was born.

I went on to pick up Yankee, Prince and Pudd'nhead, only to delve deeper into the genius that was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

This documentary is, by far, bar none, the greatest and most intimate documentary I've yet to see.  You get the idea of what Twain was all about, be it a social critic, an absolutely devoted father, a quick tempered Missourian, or an eternally loving husband.

For all the absolute suffering that he went through, all people, be they great or seemingly miniscule, go through a great deal of suffering, but none in comparison seem to have gone through as much as Twain, the fact that he continued on joking and biting at politics the way he did is just astonishing.

I'd always been a bit hesitant to put my hands on anything by Burns, what with his reputation for being an over the top, boring, self gratifying pompous (fight censorship), but this was done with such finesse that all presumptions flew right out the window.

The excellent narration by Keith David need well be noted.

2420208,5,B000BITUI4,"This has to be one of the best documentaries on a literary figure that has ever been made. In the hands of Ken Burns, the richness and subtlety, the humour and tragedy, the successes and dismal failures and a true sustained analysis of the life of Samuel Clemens all combines to give us a personal and intellectual understanding of this towering literary icon of the 19th century. Twain was many things - a riverboat pilot, printer, journalist, miner, speculator, failed business man, and satirist, but most of all a novelist, a grand storyteller that spoke to royalty, presidents as well as the common people. Ernest Hemingway once said that American literature began with the publication of Huckleberry Finn. Twain chose to write this book in the language of the vernacular, while other writers maintained an allegiance to English prose, Huck Finn's voice rose above conformity, informing the American public that the black American was not just a commodity, an object of scorn and prejudice, but a human being. This book not only changed our views on literature but our humanity as well. This film does not skim over the surface of Twain's life and work, but digs deeper into his motivations and inspirations in the context of his environment.
~Mark Twain~ took almost three years to produce, which includes hundreds of photographs, actual film footage of the man at home, informed interviews with Twain scholars and writers that give us keen insights into his life and work. What this film shows is that not only is his literature extraordinary, but his life as well. And this life is told mainly through the words of the man himself. Twain lived a dual persona, the man and the celebrity. As another writer has said, this dual persona came to symbolize the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth-morality and freewheeling ambition. Twain lived an extravagant life though hated everything that this represented. He was the author of the Gilded Age, a scathing satire on the post civil war period in which the country prospered and money was worshiped above all things, yet his wealth and lifestyle emulated that very thing he was satirizing. He claimed that he wasn't American, but `the' American. He was a man of genius and contradictions but above all, human, a man who showed us through his work, with a sly wink, that we're all human and essentially in the same boat.
This film is undoubtedly one of the best portraits of Mark Twain ever to be done. After watching the film in its entirety, I was hard pressed to find any genuine criticisms, other than minor quibbles and therefore not worth mentioning.

But there is so much more to Twain's life than just the now-household names of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.  Twain was a complex man, and this documentary examines his very interesting life.
Samuel Clemens, aka Mark Twain, lived a very eventful life.  Aside from his fiction, which is very, very well done, Twain was also a very able travel writer.  He wrote many of his books about his hometown or about his beloved river, the Mississippi, but he also wrote about far away and exotic places.  This film examines all of Twain's work, and, more importatly, the life he lived while he was producing it.

Some of the notable quotes I found are: ""I am not an American, I am The American"", ""I like Michael Angelo, but I cannot have him for break fast, lunch, dinner, supper and in between meals was a witty and worthy view about Rome"" and the best is the poster lines ""Doors open at 7.

I am humbled by this man Mark Twain. Ken Burns was his normal genius self in his interpretation of his life. But the life of this man Samuel Clemens and his incarnation of Mark Twain humbled me in ways--you were right--I had to see and experience.

I was ready to easily ""forgive"" Mark Twain for a racism that probably--if not obviously--never existed in him because it protected an ignorant perspective I had on both him and his work. Clemens grew up in 19th century America, which perhaps for anyone else says it all. But I see now not just where his work and genius codified if not invented true American literature, but how his work and genius in that context combined with the Civil Rights movements of the late 19th and later 20th centuries to save the collective American soul. This was metaphorically underscored by the almost trivial fact that he saw to it that that genius lawyer McGuinne, the Black laywer mentor of Thurgood Marshall, graduated from Yale Law School by paying his tuition (and he graduated at the top of his class). I call myself an American--sometimes even a literate American--and I knew nothing about this man before this DVD. Wow. And yet that is nothing to be ashamed of, depsite the new desire I have to know him as a function of better knowing and loving my own soul better and more welling up in me; feelings and desires that usually well up within me when shame is at the source driving them. I felt like a child discovering something beautiful and powerful for the first time when I watched Twain's life unfold in this DVD, in the way children in their innocence see the magic of both themselves and the universe simultaneously, and do so unashamed. This humility in discovery, leading to the outer world discovery being metaphorical to the inner, is the source of all art, and all life. And Samuel Clemens knew this better than most people alive in any time, let alone his own. He reminded me of Richard Burton (the actor's namesake)--who I also know next to nothing about, yet am also inspired by the romantic/spiritual quest of his life, and the knowledge and beauty it produced.

I haven't been this impressed by a single artist in history in a long time. (And he's a Sagittarius too! Ha-ha! Like Beethoven, Sinatra and Spielberg! Does it get any better?!) The review I write for this DVD will be a lot like the one I wrote for the autiobiography of Malcolm X.
I hope the irony of that will not be lost on anyone.

This Mark Twain DVD of Ken Burns is beautiful. It is not just awe-inspiring, it is in it's own artistic way life-altering--like its subject matter. I can only sit back, listen to authors and artists ranging from Arthur Miller to Bugs Bunny genius Chuck Jones share profound insghts, see both the triumphs and the tragedies of his life unfold, and feel the power of love upon reflecting on Twain's life, artistic legacy and Ken Burns' magesterial work in this DVD.

2420216,5,B000BITUI4,"I always admired Mark Twain, but his character gained entirely new dimensions for me when I saw him through the eyes of the scholars that Ken Burns captures on film. I thought of him simply as a great story teller with funny and fun characters like Tom Sawyer. I never thought of Mark as a social agitator and yet, I realize now just how much he edged into society. I have never read Huckleberry Finn, so I never realized just how dramatic that piece was. As Huckleberry Finn comes to think of ""... Jim"" as a man and the great and conflicting quotes that Sam Clemens puts into the mouth of the ""babe"" that is Huck Finn, ""Now, it's not right, you stealin' yourself like that, Jim,"" are today, so sarcastic and comical. So funny in fact, that they hurt.
I never realized just how painfully and subtly Mark Twain was able to reach into the general psyche of the American consciousness and point out that which was obviously contradictory, obviously hypocritical. Clemens was a genuis and his real insight may yet be unknown. This is a simply fantastic view of a great man.",1017705600,,1069,4.515463917525773
2420217,5,B000BITUI4,"You can't ask more of a documentary filmmaker than to make you love the hero of his work as much as he does. I was actually disappointed that I'd never gotten to meet Twain or see him perform in public.  There is only a very tiny amount of moving film footage on Twain extant so Burns has to present Twain with stills.  That is potentially dry and dull territory when watching a film.  Burns makes it work though by interspersing lots of methods of treatment.  The interviews with ""experts"" about Twain are of the highest caliber with the observations by Arthur Miller, William Styron and Hal Holbrook being the most perceptive ones.

Miller's observation that artists and writers make terrible business people because they have an excess of imagination had me thinking for days!  The actor who supplied Twain's voice and read his work off camera does such a convincing job that I was convinced it was Twain talking to me even though I knew that was impossible.  Burns's ""Jazz"" was a flawed but worthy work and now I'm watching the one about Frank Lloyd Wright.  Much as I like Wright's work, I dislike him as a person so cannot fully immerse myself as I did in the Twain. Burns' ""Lewis & Clark"" was my favorite work of his prior to the Mark Twain work and now this has become my #1 Ken Burns documentary.  There are a lot of good extras on the dvd too but the work itself is so superb that it is just extra frosting.

2420218,4,B000BITUI4,"Burns has talent at making history come alive as if you are watching it live.  His choice of using Mark Twain is without question great and the whole film (as i viewed on PBS) was excellent and i looked forward to the next night's episode.
I also think that Burns' filmaking has not really changed at all.  Its almost the same as the Civil War.  I guess there is only so much you can do with archival footage but i would like to see him go out on a limb and do something inovative in his next major project.
Twain is definately worth the money though an excellent story of a real person that embodies the fiction he created.",1015372800,,624,4.226890756302521
2420219,5,B000BITUI4,"Its on both sides of one DVD disk, and runs for several hours. It touches on all the wonderous parts and stages of his life, displays numerous hard to find photographs of people and places in his life, accompanied by very fitting music, and intersperced with Clemens's own words, and critical comments from Twain scholars, Hal Holbrook (who wrote and performed 'Mark Twain Tonight!'), William Styron ('Sophie's Choice', 'Confessions of Nat Turner') and others. You get immersed and drowned in it and emerge as from a novel or a dream. You feel you come to know Mark Twain by the end of it, and find yourself completely satisfied. Afterwards, you re-read Huckleberry Finn, ready to find all the things you missed the first time around.",1014163200,,734,4.88
2420220,3,B000BITUI4,"One cannot argue with the choice of Mark Twain for an in-depth biography. As stated in many of the other reviews, Twain was an Amercian original and deserving of praise. Also, one cannot argue that, considering his past successes, Ken Burns could make a biography of anyone he would like to, but I'm starting to get tired with his formulaic approach. By now, almost anybody with a good research department can do a ""Burns"" style documentary. Certainly he is bringing good information to people, but I see no growth in him as a filmmaker. Maybe I'm being too picky. Twain is a remarkable character whose life encompassed more twists and turns than the Mississippi River. He is deserving of more than the same old same old same old . . .",1013385600,,735,4.6183206106870225
2420221,5,B000BITUI4,"Mark Twain the man is a giant that looms on the American literary and cultural landscape like a single-faced Mt. Rushmore.  Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner cited ""Huckleberry Finn"" as the father of the American novel.  I recall Hemingway calling it the greatest of American novels.  In fact, Twain once said of himself, ""I am not an American, I am the American.""  Born Samuel Langhorn Clemens, he arrived with Haley's Comet and predicted he would depart on its return.  He did.  In between he became the most famous of all living persons and entertained all classes of the English speaking world with his effortless wit and wisdom --  often attacking hypocrisy and greed and racism along the way.  He took his pen name, Mark Twain, from the phrase Mississippi river boatmen used to signify a depth off 12 feet -- the point at which dangerous water became safe or vice versa.  Ken Burns' magnificent 220 minute documentary looks at Twain's personal life from hardscrabble backwoods boyhood to international acclaim.  Loaded with period photos and a wonderfully authentic soundtrack, Twain's words come alive and are further colored with informed commentary from Twain scholars.  There's ample bonus material including a making of and behind the scenes features, interviews and outtakes.  This is truly a life on film and it is superb in all aspects. This is one not to miss and there's a haunting separately available soundtrack that is rich with authentic period music that will life your soul and haunt you.",1011571200,,1514,5.012
2420222,5,B000BITUI4,"This is truly a delight. Sam Clemens was a man that demanded respect as complex as he was witty. At a time when most of us
could use a little personal moment of triumph, spending some time with Mark Twain is great therapy.",1011571200,,222,4.186046511627907
2420223,5,B000BITUI4,"First: This is a great DVD, and anyone who loves Twain, literature, or Americana must see it. Second: This is one person's version of what is most important about Twain's life. But how could it be otherwise? Vast areas of interest are either glossed, or omitted. Twain's big time interest in spirituality and the then emergent metaphysics was not covered. And yet, in his later real life, this was arguably Twain's consuming passion, resulting in virtually all of his writings from the late 1880s onwards. That's just an example. There are others, including Twain's own writings about his Civil War experiences as a Confederate gunboat pilot; his personal relationships and related ""drama"" with authors Hawthorn and Longfellow, and ex-general and ex-president U.S. Grant, to name but a few. And his intense friendship and mentoree-ship with William Dean Howells. Etc.... On the other hand, who can say what features would be salient if we could have been a friend or associate of Samuel Clemens? The real-life mix might have been quite different from what any of us would imagine, and different from the version director Ken Burns has wrought. After I watched this DVD, I wished fervently that this could have been a 15-hour documentary. There is simply so much to say. And some of the dramatic renditions of Twains writings-- presented as snippets here and there-- would have made important and powerful contributions had they been presented in their entirety. Burns did an admirable job given the limited time available. This production is not quite the sweeping and definitive statement his earlier ""Civil War"" series was; but the topic is no less important. To paraphrase Burns, and Twain, a study of Twain the man and author is to study America herself. As Twain said, he wasn't AN American, he was THE American. The hundreds of never before seen photos add a thrilling and haunting dimensional peek into our history. The onscreen remarks of actor Hal Holbrook and playwrite Arthur Miller are profoundly meaningful. The remarks of the other ""Twain scholars"" are mixed. All made valuable contributions, although one of the guys seemed a little dissociated and sterile at times. Imagine trying to cram a man like Mark Twain into some modern psychological theory-du-jour! Can't be done; shouldn't be tried. So, enjoy this important DVD. And continue to read collections of Twains letters, journals, and his stories. Watch all the other rich sources of insights into this amazing force of Nature, and don't be afraid to form your own conclusions, perhaps not cast, as this DVD occasionally was, in the PC zeitgeist of our current age.",1011139200,,2635,5.059770114942529
