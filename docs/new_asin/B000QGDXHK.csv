8196338,3,B000QGDXHK,"If you are a TOHO fan like me, the Mysterians is worth the price of admission. Varan is OK but Matango is just cheesy and obviously low-budget.",1412899200,,143,4.333333333333333
8196339,5,B000QGDXHK,I grew up watching Japanese sci fi/horror flicks. Toho productions did amazing work considering the size of their budgets. If you keep this in mind and realize they did just about everything with models you just might enjoy it.,1401840000,,227,4.846153846153846
8196340,5,B000QGDXHK,I was able to finally get a copy of the set and I absolutely love it. All three movies are great and have just the amount of cheesiness I've come to expect from Toho.,1376524800,,166,3.911764705882353
8196341,5,B000QGDXHK,"First off I had gotten this DVD before it was 72 bucks I'm writing this review after a year or 2 ago I bought it for 15 bucks. Now I love giant monster films especially Toho's. Any monster fan should own this box set. So with this triple terror feature you get 3 discs and each film comes with the original Japanese release and the US dub. First we have The Mysterians 1957: A colony of space beings come to earth asking for land and the right to mate with earth women. No human takes kindly to this request and war is waged. The Mysterians have an awesome giant robot called Moguera or Migara (far left on the DVD cover), they also have high tech weaponry which is lasers tons of lasers are in this film with plenty of explosions. The disc comes with subtitles, English dub, Japanese original, an option to watch the film with the soundtrack only, trailers, and some more. Up next Varan the Unbelievable 1958: now this film is pretty good. Some scientists  set out to find some rare butterfly on the island they are attacked by the monster Varan which is worship by the island natives well actually they call it Baradagi (Bear-A-Dogee). Any way Varan has the ability of flight due to a membrane that goes from his elbow to his knees, he can swim, crawl, and walk he's almost worse than Godzilla but is less powerful then him. Well Varan is reptilian and is cool he is one of my favorite monsters. Now the English dub is not included thank god because the English dub is unwatchable scenes are cut and other scenes are put into the wrong places. The film does come with subtitles, Japanese original, trailers, and more. The final film in this set Matango 1963: A film about a ship wrecked crew on an island filled with mushrooms but be warned for the mushrooms cause mutations. This is a unique horror film released by Toho and it's really good. The film comes with English dub, Japanese original, trailers, and much more. Bottom line buy this set.",1360713600,3,1948,4.47191011235955
8196342,5,B000QGDXHK,"At long last!  Three terrific Toho terrors available in a handsome three-box set!
First: Mysterians, a wonderfully-gaudy special effects film with dazzling effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, gritty direction by Ishiro Honda and a terrific musical score by Akira Ifukube.  Wonderful wide-screen format in glorious color.
Then: Varan the Unbelievable.  Although one of the lesser efforts, this film still has much to recommend it.  Although with Honda's taut direction is Tsuburaya's usually fine work (and a wonderful monster costume worn by Haruno Nakajima) by possibly Ifukube's finest monster score.
Finally: Matango, Honda's best horror film and a truly creepy picture from a terrific script by Takeshi Kimura.
What really makes the icing on the cake are commentaries by those who were there.  In all, this box set is a wonderful tribute and would make a fine introductory gift to those interested in the genre.

8196343,4,B000QGDXHK,"After seeing the trailer for SPACE AMOEBA on Youtube, I definately wanted to buy the dvd. Space Amoeba was not available at the store, but I saw this Toho Pack. So after a few moments of deliberation I figured three movies for 20 bucks. I'll take a chance. First up THE MYSTERIANS. This is a great old school science fiction ""Aliens invade earth"" movie. Presented in 2:35.1 Widescreen with choices of English dubbed, Japanese spoken and a few other features I'm too lazy to write about. After sending A wierd looking giant robot to destroy a town the aliens known as Mysterians reveal themselves, stating they meant no harm but only to display their superiority. Then they ask to remain on earth in a small 2 miles radius, and for permission to marry Earth women. As if they would except ""NO"" for an answer. Despite the corny premise this movie is really cool. Next up is VARAN THE UNBELIEVABLE shown in Black & White but also presented in 2:35.1 widescreen. In fact all three films in this set are 2:35.1 the true widescreen, so that's really cool. Not to be confused with the 1:85.1 phoney widescreen which really isn't widescreen at all just a cropped picture. This is the Japanese Spoken version only. I wish they also included the Myron Healy English dubbed  version because I never got to see that and it's so hard to find. For those of you who don't know who Myron Healy is. He was the Bully of Dry Gulch in the 1950s classic Superman tv series. Another thing I found interesting was the music motiff we associate with Rodan was really from this movie. In fact you can hear many well known Akira Ifukube signature themes that have been used in many Toho films. They were rewritten and played in various styles, but their teeth were cut here. Finally we have MATANGO Attack of The Mushroom People. Critically acclaimed and deservedly so because it is a well done movie almost in a Hammer Horror style production. But it's lack of Daikaiju (Giant Monsters) made it a little dull for me. Maybe only roughly a third of TOHO PRODUCTIONS had Giant Monsters, but to me Toho movies with out giant monsters is Toho in name only. Still a good set to buy. I hope Tokyo Shock puts out a second TOHO PACK that will include ATRAGON, DOGORA, and LATITUDE ZERO.",1200787200,8,2252,4.560493827160494
8196344,4,B000QGDXHK,"These three offerings are almost always overlooked (or should I say overshadowed) by Gojira and other Toho films. This is a shame for they are all interesting bits of toho History. The Mysterians has one of the most stirring Military (read battle) music compositions . Varan and Matango are also fun films in their own right. This is a worthwhile set to pick  up-suitable for the whole family. Turn out the lights, grab some popcorn and reminisce about staying up late as a kid and watching ""Creature Features""",1197504000,,510,4.795454545454546
