8282483,3,B001BAKEWC,It was unrealistic to expect that by watching a video or two I could get there. I should have known better than to believe the advertisement literally.,1362700800,,151,4.62962962962963
8282484,1,B001BAKEWC,"ASIDE FROM BEING SHOCKED AND SICKENED BY THE 70 Yr Old Woman With The Vibrator... Here's the rest of the terrible experience...

Based on some other associated reviews we were reluctant to purchase this item, mostly concerned of material defect. Unfortunately we chose to purchase anyway, when instead we should have listened to our instincts. To save some time, all that has been mentioned in these other reviews we saw is TRUE. Loose discs, affixed discs still severly scratched, badly warped unsightly case, and yes, suprisingly enough the burned tire foul odor lingering. Since we mistakenly believed were stuck with the item, we watched much to our dismay. Just plain lousy this entire thing is. My husband is currently filing an A-Z Guarantee to reclaim the funds wasted on this. 7(GTHRC)31(GTHRC)2011.

UPDATE: We were actually contacted multiple times by e-mail and then by TELEPHONE, though we had never guven our phone number to the company we bought from! Reverse Directory? How dare they! And to make matters worse, we have began receiving POSTAL Solicitations for multitudes of Adult Products. Our Mailing address was apparently SOLD. Our NEIGHBOR in our building recieved one of the pamphlets in error. Beyond embarassing. Should have known better.",1313107200,2,1262,5.211822660098522
8282485,1,B001BAKEWC,"This review will be brief. This ""production"" is SO bad, you may very well actually get physically ill. My Wife actually DID vomit. Many scenes you simply cannot ""unsee"" no matter how hard you try... such as the obese couple bouncing idiosynchratically against each other sitting indian style, and the Crown Jewel of this ""video""... the 70 year old woman enjoying her vibrator spasmotically as if she were having a grand mal seizure. Would give anything to be able to forget what's in this product. Worse than the ""2 Girls 1 Cup Reaction""!!

Buy at your own risk. There's far too many nicer things you can buy for $23 that your loved would enjoy instead of *this*... If you do buy it, remember this post... you'll see all was and is true in my representations for you.",1278028800,4,767,4.598540145985401
8282486,4,B001BAKEWC,"it took awhile to recieve the item, vendor was on vacation, but he delivered and the video was excellent. thank you for folowing thru
and sending the video",1228089600,,155,4.571428571428571
8282487,5,B001BAKEWC,Bought it for my boyfriend.  Not great only learned one good tip from this DVD.  Not sure it's worth the price.,1217721600,,111,4.238095238095238
8282488,4,B001BAKEWC,"The production was done well. The menu includes chapters including: Intro, 7 Chakras, Full Body Orgasm, Male Superior Position, Female Superior Position, Sitting Position, Extending Orgasms, Multi-orgasmic women & multi-orgasmic men.
These are real couples, most 30s-50s, some with great energy between them, one with an overweight male who looks like he never moves & has no concept of energy connection. The female voice over was great, the interviews of how the couples describe what the feel & how they go about doing it was more informative & better then the videos.
For men to extend orgasm is the usual use of PC muscles, for full body is to touch the whole body so that the whole body feels it & longer & use mind focus, for multi male it's to follow the energy & keep going whatever pace you want. If you already are very aware of your & your lover's enrgy, you probably won't learn anything. If you are totally new to this concept, this video & Playboy's Tantric lovemaking are a good start. I already can do all this, but it was good to see this concurs with what I have self-taught myself & that everyone can do it they just slow down & explore more instead of rushing or thinking a faster speed is always the answer.
This is real penetration, real couples & even real orgasms. If you're lookig for porn, this is not it. It's about not focusing on the status quo, hip area only, boring orgasm & touching longer & enjoying the moment so you have have deeper, longer lasting, healing orgasms that blow away the other orgasm & this video goes into more detail. If everyone had sex this way, there would be more love & respect in the world & much more satisfaction with life.
There's an extra 30 minute long, very boring, rudimentary sex ed w/Marty Kelin, PhD titled ""The couple's guide to Better Orgasms"" Some info is finding the G Spot, going slower, etc. very, very, very basics & VERY dry. Even the couple were boring to see & no passion or anything.",1200441600,18,1962,4.545197740112994
8282489,3,B001BAKEWC,"This video was not something I would watch with my husband, it is more educational. Most of the couples are older & we giggled more than enjoyed it in other ways. Although I will say that it was very interesting to see how a man can 'change' his performance. It does have some good ideas on how to become closer to your partner.",1184198400,4,328,4.222222222222222
8282490,5,B001BAKEWC,"If you are new to erotic massage, I recommend this video. It shows that a slow, gentle, and sensual massage  leads to more eroticism. If you want a regular massage, go to a massage therapist. If you want to learn erotic massage as foreplay, try this one.",1104192000,32,254,4.404255319148936
8282491,4,B001BAKEWC,I was hoping to learn something new but was a little disappointed. I have never watched a video like this before and was expecting lots of detail on new techniques. I know tantra offers details and good instructions on how to perform certain techniques but the video left those out. I did give it four stars though because the movie was very arousing and the actors (hard to tell they are acting at all) were honest and believable. It was well presented and not offensive. Overall a good investment but if you are looking for more info on tantra then look at the books instead. The books offer more detailed instruction. Boyfriend found the video distracting during lovemaking. So if you buy this film try to watch it in its entirety before practicing its technique.,1093478400,75,766,4.681481481481481
