2946008,5,B000VNMS6U,"For some time, there have been rumors about a Libera DVD. Finally it's out. I purchased both the CD and DVD versions of this concert. Each has its own good points. Both include a lot of familiar Libera music. The most significant thing I noticed in both was the excellence of performance. Since this is a live performance, it's difficult to hide mistakes. While I noticed a few minor flaws, this is really great for a live performance.

The sound quality is a bit different between the CD and DVD. Each is appropriate to its own medium. The surround sound on the DVD gives it the ""just right"" feel. You get a real sense of what the concert must have been like in the rather intimate church venue.

An advantage of the DVD is that it has two extra tracks as well as personal interviews with some of the choir members. All in all, this was money well spent. I now look forward to the possibility of a concert tour in the US this spring that appears to be in the offing.",1196726400,7,967,4.3076923076923075

2946010,5,B000VNMS6U,"This DVD is amazing! If you like Libera (if you don't then you don't appreciate good music!) then this is a real treat! Unlike so many other live recordings, this doesn't sound 'live' ie the songs sound like you expect them to. The songs as always are beautifully sung. The whole concert is recorded with brilliant quality both sound and vision. The bonus item where the boys give short interviews, is wonderful and will certainly amuse you! Thanks to everyone connected with Libera for at last giving us the chance to see these talanted young lads at their best. This still hasn't been released in the UK yet, but as always Amazon delivers FAST! If you live outside the US and want this DVD, I give it maximum score as well as giving Amazon maximum score for their truly excellent service. Buy this....... you won't be sorry!",1194393600,14,826,4.625850340136054

2946012,5,B000VNMS6U,"Robert Prizeman has given fans of Libera what they have desired for a long time and displayed the great talents of the boys to all those who are new to Libera.  The music is well performed and the quality of their live performance compares well to studio recordings on their other albums.  For those who have been unable to see them live before, it is great to see the boys faces as they sing.  Libera's music is not your typical boy choir and compares to Enya and Celtic Woman.  The extra features include interviews with the boys, ""Libera In Their Own Words,"" that reveal these angelic voices are just vivacious boys who have been well trained to bring something wonderful to the world.",1193702400,12,688,4.569105691056911
2946013,5,B000VNMS6U,"Absolutely beyond outstanding!!  This DVD contains some of Libera's most popular selections and they are done to perfection.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

The music of the boys is absolutely haunting and evocative.  If you have never experienced Libera you MUST!  While I understand that their music is based in the Christian religion, I believe that people of all faiths can appreciate its beauty!

Sometimes I find it difficult to believe that these are young boys from 8 - 14, and that they live basically normal lives of kids, doing what kids do and experiencing life to its fullest.  That's so easy to forget when you see them dressed in their white frocks and hear them singing like angles.

Robert Prizeman and Phillip Byrd the directors have produced a sound that is absolutely unique in the world.  It speaks volumes of love, tranquility and devotion.  These boys really care about their music and love it.  It's the SOUND of ANGLES!!!

Libera does not get to the US so we are unable to see them in person, so the DVD is the next best thing.  The DVD is in Dolby Surround sound, and believe me when I say you are there, it's just beautiful!

The DVD offers some insight into their personal lives and their future goals.

If the DVD sound track is as good as it sounded during recording (if anything, it should be better), this DVD must sound like heaven.",1191110400,28,307,4.220338983050848

2946020,5,B000VNMS6U,"If you're like me, you usually run into boys' choir performances at Christmas and that's about it. But one Christmas I discovered Libera and found they were a boys' choir for all seasons. This DVD touches on Christmas repertoire only in the bonus tracks and otherwise contains original Libera material, touching on most of their hits up to the time of the recording (May 2007). These are mostly original works by their conductor, Robert Prizeman or his adaptations of classical works. A section of Holst's Jupiter becomes an ode to England (I Vow To Thee My Country) and Saint-Saens Aquarium from The Carnival of the Animals gets a delightfully eerie treatment as Lacrymosa, and everyone will recognise the source of Sanctus.

It would seem that Mr. Prizeman wanted to expand both the material and the style of the typical boys' choir and this he has done admirably. Nothing wrong with the traditional material, but sometimes it can sound old fashioned and overly formal for our age. Libera sounds fresh and contemporary with complex rhythms and harmonies that though somewhat influenced by New Age music, especially Enya, are still very much their own. By retaining the older boys whose voices have broken to supply backup for the trebels, he has found a way to keep the choir from sounding too high pitched. Moreover, when you pay attention to the lyrics - and the DVD thoughtfully provides optional subtitles - you find that these often pop sounding songs are really updated hymns in their content, containing the same truths.

The execution by the choir is absolutely note perfect and you can tell there were many hours of practice. Because a boys' choir is naturally a constantly evolving group, a word about this variant of Libera. Amid the many changes, a group like Libera usually comes together around featured soloists and tends to have relative stability for a while before another wave of changes. The ""previous"" Libera was centered on the soloists Steven Geraghty and Ben Crawley but as all boys do, they grew out of their positions. This was a ""new"" Libera forming in the mid 2000's centered much on the excellent soloist Tom Cully, and also featuring many other important Libera soloists like Ben Philipp, Josh Madine, Liam Connery, Ed Day and Sam Leggett. And all of the non-soloists perform their parts beautifully as well. This is one of the strongest lineups Libera has ever had.

If you are at all inclined to like this group, this is one of the best titles from their large catalog. I know there are already plenty of reviews here, but I just had to add my praise for such a positive and inspirational group.",1393113600,4,2629,4.837777777777778
2946021,5,B000VNMS6U,I've watched this video 100 times and I never tire of it. It is inspirational and uplifting. I recently purchased another copy for a friend whose mother just died.

2946028,5,B000VNMS6U,"I adore Libera.  Having been introduced to them on Songs of Praise, quite by chance, I was immediately smitten.  Appropriately, they were presented by Aled Jones, former boy tenor superstar himself, who I also loved.  Libera (or should I say Prizeman) have cleverly taken some of the most rapturous melodies ever written (Pachelbel's Canon, Dvorak's New World Symphony, Bach's Air, etc.) and put words to them, apart from traditional church music and popular song, eg. Brian Wilson's Love and Mercy.  Their exquisite sound is a powerful dichotomy - ordinary boys producing the sound closest to Heaven!  What a mix!  This contradiction has always amazed me.
They consistently reduce this (old) man to tears.

2946032,5,B000VNMS6U,"I have just purchased this video, after purchasing and listening to their songs, either on You Tube or cds. I just love em. The quality of the boys singing, high class. It's the first choir I have seen, they seem to enjoy what they're doing. The video of high clarity. One song that grabs me is Going Home, with soloists Tom Cully, Joshua Madine, Ben Phillipp. It sung with such feeling, being about passing away to heaven, hence home being heaven. Joe Snelling just brilliant in Salva Me. The un talked about Ed Day, is brilliant, when he teams up with Tom Cully and Liam Connery, is a few songs. Can't wait for the new boys to start producing albums. All Libera cds are fantastic. Even the ones in 2001",1345248000,,704,4.423076923076923

2946034,5,B000VNMS6U,This CD is more than incredible. The boy's singing is amongst the best I have ever heard. The song Sanctus sends chills down my spine...it is that ethereal. I loaned it to my mom and she has now fallen in love with their music and she will be getting two of Libera's CDs for Christmas.,1322179200,,285,4.2
2946035,5,B000VNMS6U,"This is an excellent DVD that offers perhaps the last opportunity to see some of Libera's best talent. Tom Cully, Josh Madine, and Ben Philipp have all gone through their voice changes now and will no longer be heard in their original boys' voices.  Great that these special talents have been captured on DVD. I just wish this group would tour the U.S. again.",1297555200,,359,4.609375
2946036,5,B000VNMS6U,"This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful choir DVD's I have heard. It is so unique hearing these young boys
perform and sing beautiful songs. I would recommend this and any others they produce. I don't know how you could go
wrong, if this is the kind of music you are looking for. Very peaceful and moving.",1294704000,,311,4.379310344827586
2946037,5,B000VNMS6U,"Libera Boys Choir is absolutely magnificent singing by a group of British youth who form the Choir.  ""Angel Voices"" is an apt description of the boys' voices.  Worth buying and listening to over and over.",1294099200,,204,4.8

2946039,5,B000VNMS6U,"This CD if fabulous! I gave it as Christmas Gifts and everyone is enjoying it so much.  The English Boy's Choir is excellent.  I and others also loved the variety of music on ""Libera In Concert"".  My only problem with the CD is that the applause appears after every piece. I have to applaud the director and musicians in words.",1293235200,,327,4.416666666666667
2946040,3,B000VNMS6U,"I suppose it is nice to known that these are ""angelic"" rather than ""diabolique"" voices -- but what PRECISELY are they singing? Bach, ""Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,"" ""Jingle Bells"", Handel's ""Messiah"", Gregorian Chant...?  It does make a big difference for the potential buyer.  The 3 stars are for the INFORMATION since I have no way to judge the style of music you are selling.",1287187200,,384,4.803030303030303

2946044,5,B000VNMS6U,"If choral music is something you enjoy, you will surely find great pleasure in this album.  It was recorded in 2007 and I have no idea what the 'current' Libera is like, but these kids are incredible. See the interviews following the concert: they are special as well!",1271635200,,268,4.583333333333333
2946045,5,B000VNMS6U,"Because boy choirs rarely get the opportunity to travel very much, this album is a real treat for all of us who will never get that opportunity to hear them in a live performance.  The music, staging, lighting, and incredible voices of Libera singing in a cathedral in Holland is about as close to perfection of their capabilities as anything I've ever seen from a performance by a young group of very talented vocalists.  Each one contributes to the whole, and this ensemble has been very well trained by their leader, Robert Prizeman, to sound like an angelic choir beyond one's wildest imagination.  Many of the members of this 2009 video are at their peak performance, notably Josh Madine and Tom Cully, but they are not alone.  Every voice is polished to match the others, and their delivery, focus, and attention to diction makes a wonderful orchestra of the young male voice.  All I can say is that the money spent on purchasing this video was well spent, and if others are to come out in the near future, then bring them on!",1269907200,,1032,4.617486338797814
2946046,5,B000VNMS6U,"This DVD is not really needed for people who only enjoy their angel voices. But a scarcity of this DVD is that, it recorded at a nice time that those little stars in Libera were at a perfect age, nice looking and nice voice. Although both its image quality and sound quality is not that outstanding, with the image memory of Libera, the Tom, Josh, Ben generation, it is absolutely valuable to buy it.",1266883200,,400,4.418918918918919
2946047,5,B000VNMS6U,"Of all the boy choirs I've seen and heard,
this UK ensemble is my favorite, by far.

The CDs from this Choir are all great and
the DVD is quite well produced.

Too many choir performances are too solemn and serious;
these kids obviously enjoy singing; they aren't afraid to smile;
four of the soloists even take turns in presenting themselves and the songs.

As a bonus, there is a small segment where the kids
answer questions in an unrehearsed interview; plus
two bonus tracks added!

I like the humility and candidness of this segment.

I highly recommend this DVD and all of Libera's CDs.

Thanks and happy listening!

They are young men picked from all walks of life in the London suburbs who join the choir and have their voices trained to perfection. The travel all over the world giving concerts and even when they can no longer sing as a choir member, apparently seem to stay with the group in other capacities. As choristors, they are tops in my opinion.",1265760000,,475,4.230769230769231
2946050,5,B000VNMS6U,"The tradition of English Choir Boy music has been given a whole new rebirth by Robert Prizeman, one that is so very true to its roots yet fit for the 21st century.  These ""Angels"" with perfect boy-sporano voices are not all blond-haired Anglos but come from varied backgrounds -- as does the music!  Classics by the likes of Dvorak, Saint-Saens, Humperdinck and Holst arranged by Robert Prizeman, as well as new compositions and lyrics, mostly of the sacred sort, by Prizeman, are performed with crystaline perfection.

The Cathedral is a magnificent setting.  The videographers did a great job cutting from one soloist to another in a seamless manner.  The lighting added to the ambiance of the music and the sound was every bit as good as the CD's.  Bonus features include interviews of several members of the group.

The video quality is good, but in my opinion some of the camera work is a little unusual. There are 2 extra bonus songs accessed from the main menu.  I could not figure why these were not part of the main video. There is also a candid interview with a lot of the boys in which they talk about their training, personal comments on what life is like being part of the group and what they want to do later in life.

There are not so many ""quality european"" choir DVD's available..even less containing popular Christmas songs....and there should be.

The sound and picture quality is superb and the presentation is flawless. If Libera produce any more DVD's this household will certainly order them from Amazon....So for 2009...let's hope that more young choir music will be available on DVD....how about DVD's containing concerts from the Tolzer Sangerknaben, Vienna Boy's Choir and the Mozart Sangerknaben? and less of the smaltzy US fireside novelty christmas DVD's.

The DVD contains some of their best music and all live and spectacularly performed. It is hard to imagine that this was not recording studio music. Yes, they are actually that talented. As soon as the credits began rolling I felt desperately in need of more and then my prayers were answered; two bonus tracks and both as heavenly as all the rest.

The setting is perfect, adding to the feeling of peace that the entire concert transpires.

The lyrics -in Latin and English- are mostly based on the Christian tradition, which makes the choir sound more ""angelical"". And I have to say that this didn't spoil my enjoyment of the concert in the least (I am definitely NOT a religious person).

While watching these very young kids perform Adoramus, Far Away, Sanctus, Salva Me, Libera (the most popular), Stay With Me, or I Am The Day (my favourite) I couldn't help thinking that contrary to my earlier convictions, may be angels do exist.

You may even feel the 'goose bumps' as the group perform songs like, 'I am the day' and hymns like 'Abide with me' and 'I vow to the my Country.'

Well, the first CD led me to purchasing all of their CDs right back to the beginning, before they were Libera.  Every CD is a blessing, and the voices are unbelievable.  Your latest CD/DVD is now the most played CD and DVD I own, your voices are out of this world, and the arrangements by Robert Prizeman are exquisite, you are to be congratulated sir on a job well done.  I would like to say something about all the boys but that would take forever, but I will mention a couple of them beginning with Tom.  Well Tom, you have a wonderful voice, and I love to listen to you sing. My two favouite songs that you sing are ""Far Away"" and  ""Do Not Stand at my Grave and Weep."" God has most certainly blessed you with a beautiful voice, which you control like a professional, congratulations.  What can I say about Josh, I just love to watch his face expressions when he sings, he looks so happy.  Josh, keep smiling and having fun, because I believe you touch a lot of people when they see & hear you sing, and don't you ever change. Ed Day, you too have great control of your voice and the duets you sing with Tom are so very beautiful.  I loved your sigh of relief after singing ""Prayer."" I will add to my comment by saying that it was also a very proud sigh, for a job well done, and I personally want to congratuale you as I'm sure a lot of hard work went into learning your difficult part. Then there is mini Ben.  You sing those high notes with so much ease, and I love your solo and duet in ""Going Home,"" it is so beautiful.  There were others who also sang beautifully as well or you wouldn't be a part of Libera.  Congratulations on a job well done, and I loved the Special Features on the DVD as well, do more on the next one, please.  Keep up the great work, and I pray that God will continue to Bless you all throughout your lives.  Sometime, please come to the Capital city of Canada (Ottawa), to sing, as I'd love to see you in person.",1197936000,12,2096,4.12807881773399
2946096,5,B000VNMS6U,Libera is the New Age answer to the Vienna Choir Boys. Their stage presence and the sets where they sing add to the mood and atmosphere of their songs. It is unfortunate that they are not as well known in the US as the VCB because audience members would be able to appreciate the native English rather than the German or phonetic English of the VCB. I have given copies of their cd's as gifts and they are greatly appreciated. Give yourself a treat and listen to Libera.,1197849600,2,470,4.3522727272727275
2946097,5,B000VNMS6U,"It is hard to create a good enough title for this review. I'm simply grateful that this amazing peace of work was done. If there's something beyond life, there's certainly something of it in the music of Libera. I've watched the DVD more than ten times and it still gets me to tears. It is simply so beautiful. The professionalism that shows in every aspect of this video is awesome. From the first moment on you are captivated by the beauty of the songs and the simple but powerful settings. The camera work, lighting, simple choreography, introductions, everything works.

I would like to mention some aspects that I highly appreciate in Libera and in this DVD. First is that the young people are given the whole stage, they represent themselves, their music and the support personnel. All the adults stay in the background. Even the creator and heart of the group, Robert Prizeman, stays in the shadows, giving very small instructions. Second, the spirit of Libera is clearly visible, the joyful, loving attitude towards the music and singing. Third, the fact that some of the boys who join Libera, can continue singing even after their voice breaks, and even after that to help in composing and other practical work. It seems like a family and it shows in the video. Fourth, that the young people are given great responsibility from the rehearsals to the live performances, the peer supporting seems to really work.

I've been working for some time with youth and I believe that Libera has something special to contribute to youth work. I hope that Libera and especially Robert Prizeman could reveal some day even more about the everyday practice of the choir.

I want to thank everybody involved in this project and give special thanks to Josh (Joshua Madine) for great attitude and smile, I always get into good mood from your smile, to Tom (Cully) for your magic trick, humor and your wonderful voice especially in Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep, it always seems to get my eyes wet, to Ed (Edward Day) for the work you've done, it has certainly paid off, for mini-Ben (Benedict Philipp) for the well done introduction speech and of course the solos, to Liam (Connery) and Joe (Joseph Snelling) for your relaxed and peaceful performance, to Michael (Horncastle), Conor (O'Donnell) and Callum (Payne) for your supporting low voices, to brothers Sam (Leggett) and Alex (Alexander) for your concentration and enthusiasm, to Michael (Vereycken), Tom (Thomas) and Oliver (Cole), Jonathan (Barrington), Jacob (Wood), Tiernan (Branson), Zack (Lockett) for the amazing performance and perfect singing, to Fiona Pears for the wonderful violin solos, and of course to Robert Prizeman for making it all possible. I certainly hope to be able to see you live some day.

If there's something to improve, it is to make the next DVD release in double layer format, I'm sure there's enough material to fill a full DVD.

I hope that EMI Classics will keep on investing time and money in Libera.",1197676800,8,2985,4.868110236220472

2946099,5,B000VNMS6U,"We finally get to see a glimpse of Robert Prizeman, the master behind this group.  And what a group!  The DVD's extras are great, with lots of interviews of the boys and extra songs that aren't on the CD (Ave Maria is the best).  It's music that's been on their previous releases, but to see them do it live is really a treat.  Prizeman knows exactly what to feature about a boy's voice and how to blend textures, creating an etheral sound that envelops you.  Excellent musicality, and the choir has such confidence.  From the interviews I would guess that Libera must have very good people in management to create such a great program for youth.  The camera work was a treat, lots of close up shots as well as group shots, making it a great experience overall.

And you won't be able to keep yourself from smiling when you see Josh, the soloist with the permanent cherub smile.",1197417600,24,878,4.477987421383648
3180505,5,B000VNMS6U,"For some time, there have been rumors about a Libera DVD. Finally it's out. I purchased both the CD and DVD versions of this concert. Each has its own good points. Both include a lot of familiar Libera music. The most significant thing I noticed in both was the excellence of performance. Since this is a live performance, it's difficult to hide mistakes. While I noticed a few minor flaws, this is really great for a live performance.

The sound quality is a bit different between the CD and DVD. Each is appropriate to its own medium. The surround sound on the DVD gives it the ""just right"" feel. You get a real sense of what the concert must have been like in the rather intimate church venue.

An advantage of the DVD is that it has two extra tracks as well as personal interviews with some of the choir members. All in all, this was money well spent. I now look forward to the possibility of a concert tour in the US this spring that appears to be in the offing.",1196726400,7,967,4.3076923076923075

The whole concert is recorded with brilliant quality both sound and vision. The bonus item where the boys give short interviews, is wonderful and will certainly amuse you! Thanks to everyone connected with Libera for at last giving us the chance to see these talanted young lads at their best.

The music is well performed and the quality of their live performance compares well to studio recordings on their other albums.  For those who have been unable to see them live before, it is great to see the boys faces as they sing.  Libera's music is not your typical boy choir and compares to Enya and Celtic Woman.  The extra features include interviews with the boys, ""Libera In Their Own Words,"" that reveal these angelic voices are just vivacious boys who have been well trained to bring something wonderful to the world.",1193702400,12,688,4.569105691056911
3180510,5,B000VNMS6U,"Absolutely beyond outstanding!!  This DVD contains some of Libera's most popular selections and they are done to perfection.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.

The music of the boys is absolutely haunting and evocative.  If you have never experienced Libera you MUST!  While I understand that their music is based in the Christian religion, I believe that people of all faiths can appreciate its beauty!

Sometimes I find it difficult to believe that these are young boys from 8 - 14, and that they live basically normal lives of kids, doing what kids do and experiencing life to its fullest.  That's so easy to forget when you see them dressed in their white frocks and hear them singing like angles.

Robert Prizeman and Phillip Byrd the directors have produced a sound that is absolutely unique in the world.  It speaks volumes of love, tranquility and devotion.  These boys really care about their music and love it.  It's the SOUND of ANGLES!!!

Libera does not get to the US so we are unable to see them in person, so the DVD is the next best thing.  The DVD is in Dolby Surround sound, and believe me when I say you are there, it's just beautiful!

The DVD offers some insight into their personal lives and their future goals.

3180517,5,B000VNMS6U,"If you're like me, you usually run into boys' choir performances at Christmas and that's about it. But one Christmas I discovered Libera and found they were a boys' choir for all seasons. This DVD touches on Christmas repertoire only in the bonus tracks and otherwise contains original Libera material, touching on most of their hits up to the time of the recording (May 2007). These are mostly original works by their conductor, Robert Prizeman or his adaptations of classical works. A section of Holst's Jupiter becomes an ode to England (I Vow To Thee My Country) and Saint-Saens Aquarium from The Carnival of the Animals gets a delightfully eerie treatment as Lacrymosa, and everyone will recognise the source of Sanctus.

It would seem that Mr. Prizeman wanted to expand both the material and the style of the typical boys' choir and this he has done admirably. Nothing wrong with the traditional material, but sometimes it can sound old fashioned and overly formal for our age. Libera sounds fresh and contemporary with complex rhythms and harmonies that though somewhat influenced by New Age music, especially Enya, are still very much their own. By retaining the older boys whose voices have broken to supply backup for the trebels, he has found a way to keep the choir from sounding too high pitched. Moreover, when you pay attention to the lyrics - and the DVD thoughtfully provides optional subtitles - you find that these often pop sounding songs are really updated hymns in their content, containing the same truths.

The execution by the choir is absolutely note perfect and you can tell there were many hours of practice. Because a boys' choir is naturally a constantly evolving group, a word about this variant of Libera. Amid the many changes, a group like Libera usually comes together around featured soloists and tends to have relative stability for a while before another wave of changes. The ""previous"" Libera was centered on the soloists Steven Geraghty and Ben Crawley but as all boys do, they grew out of their positions. This was a ""new"" Libera forming in the mid 2000's centered much on the excellent soloist Tom Cully, and also featuring many other important Libera soloists like Ben Philipp, Josh Madine, Liam Connery, Ed Day and Sam Leggett. And all of the non-soloists perform their parts beautifully as well. This is one of the strongest lineups Libera has ever had.

If you are at all inclined to like this group, this is one of the best titles from their large catalog. I know there are already plenty of reviews here, but I just had to add my praise for such a positive and inspirational group.",1393113600,4,2629,4.837777777777778

3180525,5,B000VNMS6U,"I adore Libera.  Having been introduced to them on Songs of Praise, quite by chance, I was immediately smitten.  Appropriately, they were presented by Aled Jones, former boy tenor superstar himself, who I also loved.  Libera (or should I say Prizeman) have cleverly taken some of the most rapturous melodies ever written (Pachelbel's Canon, Dvorak's New World Symphony, Bach's Air, etc.) and put words to them, apart from traditional church music and popular song, eg. Brian Wilson's Love and Mercy.  Their exquisite sound is a powerful dichotomy - ordinary boys producing the sound closest to Heaven!  What a mix!  This contradiction has always amazed me.
They consistently reduce this (old) man to tears.

It's the first choir I have seen, they seem to enjoy what they're doing. The video of high clarity. One song that grabs me is Going Home, with soloists Tom Cully, Joshua Madine, Ben Phillipp. It sung with such feeling, being about passing away to heaven, hence home being heaven. Joe Snelling just brilliant in Salva Me. The un talked about Ed Day, is brilliant, when he teams up with Tom Cully and Liam Connery, is a few songs. Can't wait for the new boys to start producing albums. All Libera cds are fantastic. Even the ones in 2001",1345248000,,704,4.423076923076923

3180542,5,B000VNMS6U,"Because boy choirs rarely get the opportunity to travel very much, this album is a real treat for all of us who will never get that opportunity to hear them in a live performance.  The music, staging, lighting, and incredible voices of Libera singing in a cathedral in Holland is about as close to perfection of their capabilities as anything I've ever seen from a performance by a young group of very talented vocalists.  Each one contributes to the whole, and this ensemble has been very well trained by their leader, Robert Prizeman, to sound like an angelic choir beyond one's wildest imagination.  Many of the members of this 2009 video are at their peak performance, notably Josh Madine and Tom Cully, but they are not alone.  Every voice is polished to match the others, and their delivery, focus, and attention to diction makes a wonderful orchestra of the young male voice.  All I can say is that the money spent on purchasing this video was well spent, and if others are to come out in the near future, then bring them on!",1269907200,,1032,4.617486338797814

But a scarcity of this DVD is that, it recorded at a nice time that those little stars in Libera were at a perfect age, nice looking and nice voice.

this UK ensemble is my favorite, by far.

The CDs from this Choir are all great and
the DVD is quite well produced.

Too many choir performances are too solemn and serious;
these kids obviously enjoy singing; they aren't afraid to smile;
four of the soloists even take turns in presenting themselves and the songs.

As a bonus, there is a small segment where the kids
answer questions in an unrehearsed interview; plus
two bonus tracks added!

I like the humility and candidness of this segment.

I highly recommend this DVD and all of Libera's CDs.

Thanks and happy listening!

They are young men picked from all walks of life in the London suburbs who join the choir and have their voices trained to perfection. The travel all over the world giving concerts and even when they can no longer sing as a choir member, apparently seem to stay with the group in other capacities.

These ""Angels"" with perfect boy-sporano voices are not all blond-haired Anglos but come from varied backgrounds -- as does the music!  Classics by the likes of Dvorak, Saint-Saens, Humperdinck and Holst arranged by Robert Prizeman, as well as new compositions and lyrics, mostly of the sacred sort, by Prizeman, are performed with crystaline perfection.

The Cathedral is a magnificent setting.  The videographers did a great job cutting from one soloist to another in a seamless manner.  The lighting added to the ambiance of the music and the sound was every bit as good as the CD's.  Bonus features include interviews of several members of the group.

I could not figure why these were not part of the main video. There is also a candid interview with a lot of the boys in which they talk about their training, personal comments on what life is like being part of the group and what they want to do later in life.

Libera's performance was recorded over 3 nights at the very old historic St Pieter's Church in Leiden the Netherlands to an appreciative and enthusiastic live audience. The sound and picture quality is superb and the presentation is flawless. If Libera produce any more DVD's this household will certainly order them from Amazon....So for 2009...let's hope that more young choir music will be available on DVD....how about DVD's containing concerts from the Tolzer Sangerknaben, Vienna Boy's Choir and the Mozart Sangerknaben? and less of the smaltzy US fireside novelty christmas DVD's.

The DVD contains some of their best music and all live and spectacularly performed. It is hard to imagine that this was not recording studio music. Yes, they are actually that talented. As soon as the credits began rolling I felt desperately in need of more and then my prayers were answered; two bonus tracks and both as heavenly as all the rest.

The setting is perfect, adding to the feeling of peace that the entire concert transpires.

The lyrics -in Latin and English- are mostly based on the Christian tradition, which makes the choir sound more ""angelical"". And I have to say that this didn't spoil my enjoyment of the concert in the least (I am definitely NOT a religious person).

While watching these very young kids perform Adoramus, Far Away, Sanctus, Salva Me, Libera (the most popular), Stay With Me, or I Am The Day (my favourite) I couldn't help thinking that contrary to my earlier convictions, may be angels do exist.

From the supporting music, to the blending of the range of voices these young lads from south London, in England will certainly leave you with a very uplifting and unforgettable experience.  You may even feel the 'goose bumps' as the group perform songs like, 'I am the day' and hymns like 'Abide with me' and 'I vow to the my Country.'  Truly, an enchanting, wonderful performance by these young lads from Great Britain!  Three cheers from Canada!!!",1199923200,3,575,4.96875

3180589,5,B000VNMS6U,"I received my shipment quickly, less than a week.  The condition is like new, or is new.

I had heard the music on Public TV so I knew the quality of the voices.  It was played before our Christmas meal and my family was mezmerized.  My grandson has decided he wants to start a boys choir in his church if possible. due to these Angel Voices.

Excellent purchase for me.",1199145600,2,370,4.228571428571429
3180590,5,B000VNMS6U,"I purchased this DVD and CD for my husband for Christmas, and it was by far his (and my) most favorite gift! We just finished watching it twice through and have to say that the ethereal tones are peaceful and uplifting. This is music for your soul. We have nearly all of the Libera CDs, but this DVD is really a treat. It features both new music and several of our favorites. Do yourself or someone you love a favor and pick up this DVD. If you like their music, you won't be sorry. The production quality is excellent.",1198540800,4,519,4.252525252525253
3180591,5,B000VNMS6U,this dvd was very good. the songs were all  sung with much joy by the boys.,1198540800,2,75,3.6875
3180592,5,B000VNMS6U,"Where do I begin.  I could begin when I first heard these boys sing about a year ago, or I could jump ahead and tell you about receiving my first CD.  Well, the first CD led me to purchasing all of their CDs right back to the beginning, before they were Libera.  Every CD is a blessing, and the voices are unbelievable.  Your latest CD/DVD is now the most played CD and DVD I own, your voices are out of this world, and the arrangements by Robert Prizeman are exquisite, you are to be congratulated sir on a job well done.  I would like to say something about all the boys but that would take forever, but I will mention a couple of them beginning with Tom.  Well Tom, you have a wonderful voice, and I love to listen to you sing. My two favouite songs that you sing are ""Far Away"" and  ""Do Not Stand at my Grave and Weep."" God has most certainly blessed you with a beautiful voice, which you control like a professional, congratulations.  What can I say about Josh, I just love to watch his face expressions when he sings, he looks so happy.  Josh, keep smiling and having fun, because I believe you touch a lot of people when they see & hear you sing, and don't you ever change. Ed Day, you too have great control of your voice and the duets you sing with Tom are so very beautiful.  I loved your sigh of relief after singing ""Prayer."" I will add to my comment by saying that it was also a very proud sigh, for a job well done, and I personally want to congratuale you as I'm sure a lot of hard work went into learning your difficult part. Then there is mini Ben.  You sing those high notes with so much ease, and I love your solo and duet in ""Going Home,"" it is so beautiful.  There were others who also sang beautifully as well or you wouldn't be a part of Libera.  Congratulations on a job well done, and I loved the Special Features on the DVD as well, do more on the next one, please.  Keep up the great work, and I pray that God will continue to Bless you all throughout your lives.  Sometime, please come to the Capital city of Canada (Ottawa), to sing, as I'd love to see you in person.",1197936000,12,2096,4.12807881773399
3180593,5,B000VNMS6U,Libera is the New Age answer to the Vienna Choir Boys. Their stage presence and the sets where they sing add to the mood and atmosphere of their songs. It is unfortunate that they are not as well known in the US as the VCB because audience members would be able to appreciate the native English rather than the German or phonetic English of the VCB. I have given copies of their cd's as gifts and they are greatly appreciated. Give yourself a treat and listen to Libera.,1197849600,2,470,4.3522727272727275
3180594,5,B000VNMS6U,"It is hard to create a good enough title for this review. I'm simply grateful that this amazing peace of work was done. If there's something beyond life, there's certainly something of it in the music of Libera. I've watched the DVD more than ten times and it still gets me to tears. It is simply so beautiful. The professionalism that shows in every aspect of this video is awesome. From the first moment on you are captivated by the beauty of the songs and the simple but powerful settings. The camera work, lighting, simple choreography, introductions, everything works.

I would like to mention some aspects that I highly appreciate in Libera and in this DVD. First is that the young people are given the whole stage, they represent themselves, their music and the support personnel. All the adults stay in the background. Even the creator and heart of the group, Robert Prizeman, stays in the shadows, giving very small instructions. Second, the spirit of Libera is clearly visible, the joyful, loving attitude towards the music and singing. Third, the fact that some of the boys who join Libera, can continue singing even after their voice breaks, and even after that to help in composing and other practical work. It seems like a family and it shows in the video. Fourth, that the young people are given great responsibility from the rehearsals to the live performances, the peer supporting seems to really work.

I've been working for some time with youth and I believe that Libera has something special to contribute to youth work. I hope that Libera and especially Robert Prizeman could reveal some day even more about the everyday practice of the choir.

I want to thank everybody involved in this project and give special thanks to Josh (Joshua Madine) for great attitude and smile, I always get into good mood from your smile, to Tom (Cully) for your magic trick, humor and your wonderful voice especially in Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep, it always seems to get my eyes wet, to Ed (Edward Day) for the work you've done, it has certainly paid off, for mini-Ben (Benedict Philipp) for the well done introduction speech and of course the solos, to Liam (Connery) and Joe (Joseph Snelling) for your relaxed and peaceful performance, to Michael (Horncastle), Conor (O'Donnell) and Callum (Payne) for your supporting low voices, to brothers Sam (Leggett) and Alex (Alexander) for your concentration and enthusiasm, to Michael (Vereycken), Tom (Thomas) and Oliver (Cole), Jonathan (Barrington), Jacob (Wood), Tiernan (Branson), Zack (Lockett) for the amazing performance and perfect singing, to Fiona Pears for the wonderful violin solos, and of course to Robert Prizeman for making it all possible. I certainly hope to be able to see you live some day.

If there's something to improve, it is to make the next DVD release in double layer format, I'm sure there's enough material to fill a full DVD.

I hope that EMI Classics will keep on investing time and money in Libera.",1197676800,8,2985,4.868110236220472
3180595,5,B000VNMS6U,"I just purchased a DVD and what can I say it is simply the best choice I made for Christmas Holiday. All music are absolutely beautiful and the kids are amazing, and the whole stage settings is beyond my expectation. I will keep watching for a long time to come. Thanks to the director for putting this together.",1197417600,4,312,4.396551724137931
3180596,5,B000VNMS6U,"We finally get to see a glimpse of Robert Prizeman, the master behind this group.  And what a group!  The DVD's extras are great, with lots of interviews of the boys and extra songs that aren't on the CD (Ave Maria is the best).  It's music that's been on their previous releases, but to see them do it live is really a treat.  Prizeman knows exactly what to feature about a boy's voice and how to blend textures, creating an etheral sound that envelops you.  Excellent musicality, and the choir has such confidence.  From the interviews I would guess that Libera must have very good people in management to create such a great program for youth.  The camera work was a treat, lots of close up shots as well as group shots, making it a great experience overall.

And you won't be able to keep yourself from smiling when you see Josh, the soloist with the permanent cherub smile.",1197417600,24,878,4.477987421383648
