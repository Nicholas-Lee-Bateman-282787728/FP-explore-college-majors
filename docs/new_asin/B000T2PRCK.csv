8207642,3,B000T2PRCK,"There is a general rule of thumb that holds true for kids' movies as well as adult. Whenever the writer, producer, and actor are all the same person, the movie should be avoided. I hate to talk down a kids' movie as kids will love any kids movie and adults can only stomach the best of them. I over rated this movie at 3 stars. The child acting was far better than the adult acting. The worse character was the blind store clerk with Yosemite Sam hair. From that over cartoonish character I would judge the age of a child that would enjoy this film to be from 5 to 8, although the deadbeat dad scene may have been a little to intense for children that age.

Two groups of kids (including one with a Tomboy) battle each other with paint balls for the use of the forest owned by a wise Native American who attempts to impart some tree hugging knowledge into the kids in one scene. There is also 2 bumbling thieves who have rented a trailer from the Native American. The kids break into the trailer and steal food and a tool box(nice message for the kids). One of the thieves is the long deserted father of the main 14 year old bully, who is made to look mean because he was raised without a father (another nice message for the kids). The main adult characters outside of the Indian, tend to be buffoons.

There is also a legend of buried gold which causes the thieves to become prospectors. The immaturity of the movie may be too much for the tweens it is aimed at.",1287964800,2,1464,4.262589928057554
8207643,5,B000T2PRCK,"This is a fun, entertaining movie with a great message about getting along others and taking care of our planet. The story moves along nicely with lots of twists and turns. It is family friendly and enjoyable for kids and adults. The two bad guys have a great chemistry between them as they try to find the buried gold treasure, and the kids in the movie are very convincing as being friends. Great acting by veteran actors William Sanderson (Blade Runner, Deadwood), Dennis Haskins (Saved by the Bell), Nick Ramus (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman), Michael Stanton (Budweiser ""Ladies Night"" commercials) and a cast of convincing new, young actors. Beautiful cinematography also makes the film fun to watch. It has a very unique look. This movie is worth checking out.",1186272000,2,761,4.906976744186046
