He very much enjoyed it, and I would certainly look for more of these in the future!",1457913600,,255,4.404255319148936

7904956,4,B000006Q91,"Most Americans (the masses) are not familar with Thomas Hart Benton, Jacob Lawrence or other great American artists of the 20th Century. The exception is Norman Rockwell. He painted his way into America's soul through his cover illustrations of the Saturday Evening Post. Thousands of people may go to a museum to view the works of great artists. Millions of people have seen Rockwell's creations which have become a part of American culture.
  Born in New York, Rockwell initially failed in art at school. Tall, slender and hollow chested this young man followed his own path and ended up in becoming the greatest illustrator of his time. At an early age he was blessed with success which followed him throughout his career.
  View this young man through the 20th Century as he makes his artistic statement through his illustrations. At first you get the impression that he is a fragile man who is extremely conservative. Wrong. Rockwell enjoyed life, partied hard in his young adult years and went through personal tragedies (divorce and later on a death of his second wife). Those personal problems never got in the way of his art.
  Art critics would argue that he wasn't a great artist because of the varied constraints placed upon illustrators. Critics suffer from myopia for Rockwell captured the gentleness, power, and love of the American spirit that no other American artist could duplicate. His themes of patriotism, hope, love and close family ties and optimism enabled people to see the possibilities of what they could become.
  You will enjoy this portrait of a man who has become an artistic icon of America. We may debate the relevance of fine art versus illustration but the fact of the matter is his work touched the souls of people. On viewing his work and life your soul will be touched.",976320000,10,1808,4.866449511400652
