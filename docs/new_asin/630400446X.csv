7858687,5,630400446X,"After some confusion, Momigi ends up in Tokyo under the guidance of the TAC. In this episode, she enjoys the thrills of Tokyo. And like more episodes to come, there is another Aragami who wants to kill Momigi. This one is a crow. Forunetely, she does quite a lot of damage by firing a flare gun at it and Kusanagi takes care of the rest. The episode ends with Momigi becoming one of the TAC. The next episode introduces some of the members of the TAC, but most of it discuses the relationship between Momigi and the bazooka babe of the TAC. They start out as enemies, but in the end, they both find that they like each other. The episode also feature more Aragami fun when the TAC obtains one as a living sample and also discovers its whereabouts. The omake theater isn't quite as good as the last volume, but still pretty funny. The title of it is called Living Room Theater and it features four acts. The first one has two members of the TAC guilatine Momigi that she had as a nightmare once, except her head turns into a spider and runs away. The second act has Momigi talking with Kusangagi saying that she wants to 'see more' and then quickly changes it into 'sumo'. The third act features Kusanagi fighting an Aragami and ends up hitting something off stage. The fourth act features an old take on the Monty Python sketch. The TAC writes the funniest joke ever made and uses it to make a quick ending of the series. Pretty funny. Anyway, its on par with the last tape so I recommend it.",983664000,,1492,4.351254480286738

At first the series appears to be typical monster stuff, but by the second volume it's obviously more than just that.  Some shinto elements makes things much more interesting.
We have a silly,  over-achiever herione, with a blue seed connection to the  ""enemy"".  She happens to survive all attacks, but is it luck,  skill or destiny?
At the end of each Blue Seed volumes, there's some  omake (special fan service mini-episode totally unrelated to the main plot  with the regular characters)  Very humorous addition to this series.",962323200,,547,4.934065934065934
