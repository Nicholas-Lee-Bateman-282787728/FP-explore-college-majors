3116230,4,B0013LRKQ2,"This was a good documentary. We were able to watch it on demand in the Pacific Northwest, particularly if you have participated in transformational programs, you will likely enjoy this. If you have not, you may not be able to follow it as well. Werner is definitely an extraordinary human being, he lived his life on the forefront, in public and is committed to having his life matter. (It is always easy for us to sit on the side lines and comment about the game)",1212278400,12,464,4.470588235294118
3116231,3,B0013LRKQ2,"Although I got a lot of value from est and follow-up est workshops, and I thought this DVD had a lot of good information, I was disappointed that it did not give closure on the two major accusations leveled at Werner--the accusation by a daughter that he had sexualluy abused her, and the episode in which a staffer was choked. The DVD tells us that the daughter recanted but doesn't give any more information. The DVD is an interesting testimonial to a man who indeed had a tremendous influence in the country--but in the end, it side-stepped the opportunity to give clsoure and to put to rest once and for all the bad legends that drove this man out of this country.",1212278400,12,668,4.483606557377049
3116232,4,B0013LRKQ2,"This film is a must see for anyone who wants to know about what the est training seminar was really like (vs. the rumors and lore that are out there), what results est delivered to participants and the man behind creating it.  I found the excerpts of the actual est trainings (which I never took at the time) to be the most interesting part of the film.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more focus on Werner's life story aside from his transformational work.  I ask myself, why him?  What in his past made him the one to create this world of transformation vs. someone else who might have?  The film could have also been a little faster paced for my taste.  Finally, I think the film would have been more well rounded if it had focused less in the last act on how Werner doesn't get the credit he deserves for the difference he made in the world.  While this is almost certainly true, it is also not the point (I would suggest that the net result of the difference he made in the world is) and Werner strikes me as the kind of person who probably doesn't care too much about the credit.  But, overall, it is totally worth buying this DVD.",1212278400,9,1144,4.23963133640553

I liked this film, I am grateful it posed some of the tough questions about Werner and his work, and I would have liked more exploration and history. I have deeply valued the impact of the learning I gained from participating in est and Landmark over the years, and am grateful to the film for reconnecting Werner to the American public. He wasn't and isn't a cult leader. He is a guru in the plain and simple sense of extraordinary thinker and teacher, and he is inspirational in the sense of getting me and others off our behinds and out of our minds (joke), and active and effective in our commitments to a better working world, starting with ourselves in our families. The film is worth watching just to learn.

3116234,4,B0013LRKQ2,"For those who remember or were a part of the '70s personal growth program ""est,"" this intriguing documentary boasts two points of interest: the first interview with founder Werner Erhard since 1991 and rare, previously unreleased footage of est seminars. Transformation starts in the middle of the story, and doesn't completely explain what est actually involved and how it grew in popularity, but the film does provide  adequate background information and a concise recap of Erhard's rise and fall from grace.",1211932800,7,510,5.296296296296297
3116235,5,B0013LRKQ2,"Since I first participated in est in 1978, the seven times I got to attend events led by Mr. Erhard, the opportunity I had to assist his former organization, the four times I got to meet him personally, the time I had to work with members of his family, and the two times I got to break bread with his mother, Dorothy; I have been waiting for the day that the world could get to know this man, his work, and his family the way I had the privilege to get to know them all. This DVD is priceless. If you are an est graduate, a Forum Graduate, someone who is thinking about doing the Landmark Forum, or even if you are one of the detractors of his ""work;"" this video is a must see. Even one of his biggest critics is featured in this video.  It is historic, it is a peek behind the curtain, and it is clear picture of what happened, and how it continues to this very day.  Normally, the world first puts it's heroes on a pedestal, and then history tries to derail them by discussing their weaknesses and humanity. Werner Erhard is the opposite. His contemporaries tried to derail his work by discussing his weaknesses and humanity. History will reveal this human being for the true hero he was and is. Heroes are ""ordinary people with extraordinary commitments."" This DVD makes me proud to be an est graduate, and to have played a part in the work for the transformation of what it is to be a human being.

3116292,5,B0013LRKQ2,"Though I did the est training way back in 77', and appreciated the value of what I had 'gotten' at the time, I really hadn't thought much about Werner Erhard in decades. Seeing this film, while bringing up many feelings of nostalgia (man, could the world use the training as it was, not the watered down version that is now Landmark), but more importantly it revealed to me just how powerful and right-on-target the training was in delivering the truth that, THIS IS IT, just as it is, here and now.
  As someone who always viewed the training as something that kick-started my spiritual journey through a host of disciplines and teachers (Zen, Taoism, Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti, etc.), I have come to appreciate that Werner delivered the unfiltered 'truth' in just 40 hours, and gave everyone who did the training the opportunity for awakening. Sometimes, some time has to go by before we truly appreciate what we were given, and now, from this vantage point 37 years later, I can see clearly the brilliance of what was given in the training, and the ways in which it works in my life on a daily basis.
  All I can say is, thank you Werner (and also Ron Browning, who was my trainer) for the gift you gave to all of us all those years ago, and more importantly, for the transformation that continues to unfold in my life all these years later.",1442361600,3,1344,4.564315352697095

3116399,1,B0013LRKQ2,"I was 1 year old in 1971 and so my knowledge of est is from a child's eyes; I heard stuff about it growing up. So I was looking to learn something in this documentary. However, it was primarily a fan's tribute film, attempting to resurrect Werner Erkard's reputation (note that the wikipedia article on him mirrors this film, so some unified pr appears to be going on). Among the litany of vague platitudes of how great the training was from former participants and scholars who admire Werner, there were, I believe only two sound bites from ""est critics"" who threw some really softball items out that were quickly dismissed. So after the ""EST WAS GREAT!"" tribute, I assumed the film would cover the allegations that this was a cult, that there was brain washing involved, that psychologists deplored the group dehumanization techniques, that it tore apart families, and that he apparently became a billionaire through est. All these topics were glossed over. Even the fact that he abandoned his wife and four children (leaving them for his mistress, the film failed to mention), was turned into a glowing, positive story where one of the adult children said that seeing him in the driveway after 13 years, ""it was as if he never left."" The positive thing I can say about the film is the archival footage from Erhard's est trainings - it was fascinating and shocking to see the way the participants were verbally assaulted, and broken down, unable to talk, walk, eat, use the bathroom etc for 10 hours at a stretch. ""But the doors weren't actually locked, though people accused us of this"" was the justification. Then the filmmaker had an amazing potential for great longitudinal scenes - she found some of the people who were featured in the archival footage, decades earlier, as the est participants who were being yelled at by Werner. Couldn't the film have explored if these dehumanizing techniques were really needed for participants to ""get it""? Werner is more mellow these days and doesn't yell - why not? Did he intentionally abandon the profanity-hurling drill sgt routine, and if so why? He was interviewed in a beautiful looking home - but what was the deal with the money? No discussion of his billionaire status. It opened more questions for me than it answered and when I try to find websites with more content, I see notices from Werner's lawyers listed as updates on blog entries. So I can only assume the filmmaker only had access to the archival footage by telling the story he wanted to be told and that he is controlling the revisionist account now. What a shame to not let what is be as it is.",1373760000,6,2614,4.722100656455142

3116401,5,B0013LRKQ2,"For anyone who did the est training, back in the day, this is an amazing trip back, and one which very much ushers us right up to the present moment. I really enjoyed seeing past and ongoing footage of a substantial contributor to the human potential moment, and one who really made thinking outside the box a going concern. I am entirely grateful for the palpable difference Werner Erhard has made in my life. I believe Robyn Simon has done an outstanding job of providing a comprehensive view of Werner's persona and shows a very human and endearing man beneath all the stuff and drama of his own life. Truly a life this planet is better off for having sponsored! No matter what you thought you felt or knew about Werner, you will come away, knowing and feeling a great deal more!

3116433,2,B0013LRKQ2,"Whatever happened to fair and balanced? Did Werner produce this documentary? What about the people who had nervous breakdowns after attending his seminars, the marriages that fell apart, the friendships that ended, etc. There is no doubt that some people have benefited from EST. But the techniques used are dangerous, and the fact that a person's life is 'transformed' is not the sole measure of whether this seminar is good or not. If, through hypnosis, you achieve great things in life you must ask yourself: who exactly did the achieving? In a sense your personality no longer belongs to you. Am I making any sense? When you join an organization of like-minded people it can be very empowering. You are no longer alone in the world; other's share your values, and encourage and help you. That's all to the good. But those who are not true believers are shunned; there's no getting around it. This is the great flaw in all religions and is particularly dangerous when the belief denies the validity of other beliefs. It's also a spiritual ponzi scheme. You convince two people that you have THE ANSWER. They each convince another two people, so two becomes four becomes eight, etc. Meanwhile, the guy at the top is raking in the dough. Oh yeah, it's a BUSINESS and it ain't cheap to sign up.

The successor to EST is the Landmark Forum. They have been banned in France, as it is considered a dangerous cult.

This is not, I repeat, not an objective documentary.",1278892800,11,1464,4.71484375

3116439,5,B0013LRKQ2,"While I did not purchase this DVD I did have an opportunity to watch it recently.  I found it facinating to see what all of the fuss was about.  I was a kid in the 1970's and only heard about the Est training in passing never really knowing much about what it was.  This documentary definitely gives a clear picture of era of the Est training and explains a lot about how it was recieved.  It also sheds light on why peeople loved it and also why some people hated it.  Seeing the Est training footage and knowing that nearly a million people did it explains a lot about how American culture got from ""Leave it to Beaver"" uptight to ""Will and Grace"" self expression.

While I have heard from some people that it did not go enough into how the training worked or the controversey surrounding Werner Erhard, I found it to be very illuminating of both; the good and the ugly.  In an age of 24 hour pundit news stations and blogs, it is self-evident that everyone has an opinion about everything.

We all know what they say about opinions....  (They are like _______; everyone has got one.)

Now I know what the first line of the Est training was getting at.

I placed my order a week before my dad's birthday and paid for express delivery, but the DVD did not arrive until about five days AFTER his birthday.

3116441,3,B0013LRKQ2,"On the one hand, this movie is intended for ""original ESTies"" who would like to know where Werner Erhard ended up and enjoy some reminiscing, or need some picture-booking to show their kids.
On the other hand, it strives to generate curiosity about W.E. and the current incarnation of his trainings in Landmark Education.
I found that two essential elements are underrepresented: The actual teachings or ""ideas"" of Werner Erhard are not given enough room in the film. For long stretches there is just enough evidence and claim to make people curious, while in some moments the audience is overwhelmed with unclear concepts (such as the sequence in which the audience is flashed with ""distinctions"").
The second is the ""controversy"" around W.E., to which neither he himself nor other news sources are sufficiently cited.
The story around his family is very ""touching and inspiring"", but a chance is missed to clear up what really happened to a sufficient degree.
Can the activities of Scientology in W.E.s demise be more clarified and substantiated?
Why do we not learn more about the reasons he can not come back into the U.S.?
Also, the film does not produce a sufficient amount of transparency on Landmark education, which is repeatedly mentioned, praised, and prominently represented by Forum Leader Randy McNamara.
Where did and does all the money that EST and L.E. made and make end up?
How do Landmark's expensive advanced courses such as the ""Wisdom Course"" fit into the equation?
The Film buys into Werner's story - and in the end, that story is a story as made up as everyone else's.",1234656000,7,1592,4.921933085501859
3116442,3,B0013LRKQ2,"I enjoyed this DVD. I experienced the Forum and believe I am somewhat better for it. I think the DVD is well made. It is a bit short and I think that it skimmed the surface. It did seem a bit of a biased sales job. Those of us involved know that there are other issues with the trainings and the organization other than sometimes people came away feeling responsible for ""creating"" the tragedies of their lives. I think, this film did present mostly true information, focusing on the positive. Some of the opinions expressed seem to overdo it (is Werner Erhard really an important philosopher?), but these are presented as opinions so you cannot argue with them. Also it is important to remember that not everyone had a positive experience. I believe a lot of people had very positive experiences, but the training is not all that special  in my view and obfuscates some times more than clarifies, If you don't get it, of course, it is your responsibility assh***. If good things happen, you can credit the training.",1231459200,6,1016,4.644444444444445
3116479,3,B0013LRKQ2,"This is a fun doc for us aging est-heads (I'm afraid if I use the proper term my review will get bleeped by Amazon :-D) who've been wondering what the heck Werner has been up to all these years. But wouldn't it be nice to see some biographical material on Werner Erhard by someone who is sympathetic to Werner without being a fawning true believer who insists on making him look like a saint?

I lived in San Francisco, loved est as well as The Forum, and had friends who were in Werner's inner circle back in the day. He may or may not have abused his daughters -- I tend to believe he did not, at least not the way it was portrayed on ""60 Minutes"" -- but let's be real, the man has some skeletons in his closet (or his warehouse of designer clothes, as the case may be).

Along with Richard Nixon, Werner Erhard is one of the most interesting characters of the last half of the 20th century. He is also a serious and influential thinker who risks fading into obscurity as a caricature, a silly icon of the ""me generation."" For my money, a documentary about him would be far more captivating if it were to portray him as he really is: a three-dimensional human being, warts and all.

By not doing that, restricts its appeal to a relatively tiny audience of aging hippies nostalgic for the glory days of est. And that's a shame.",1225670400,33,1328,4.304
3116480,5,B0013LRKQ2,"And it isn't Werner, at least not alone.  He is transformation in the flesh, but the message of his work is so are you.  Each and all of us has a place in this world and we get to CHOOSE what that place is.  In the world of transformation there isn't any sitting and waiting for your purpose to reveal itself.  Life is occurring, now, and again now, and continues to moment by moment, and transformation, for an individual, a family, a community, A WORLD, can occur in a single moment.

I have worked with some of the greatest in the field of human development, Anthony Robbins, Richard Bandler, Tad James, Dr. Dave Dobson, but I have not had the opportunity to work directly with Werner, so this film intrigued me.  As a graduate of the Landmark Forum and Advanced Course, as well as numerous ongoing courses offered by Landmark throughout the world, I was curious about the man behind the technology.

Each and every time Werner is speaking in the film, I get the power that is transformation as it is being generated by a human being simply by who they are being as they are speaking.  If you can get the power of the spoken word, and then take it to another level of speaking only with intention, and then take it to another level of speaking from your commitment, not your ""personality"", how you feel, how your body feels, what's going on around you - if you could only imagine what kind of clarity, focus, authenticity is required to live a life in this manner, you begin to touch on the gift this man has given to the world. It is awe inspiring.

From the outside looking in, the work of est and Landmark Education can never be fully experienced.  It is something that requires action, a single action, and that is to participate in the Landmark Forum.  You will never have the experience of swimming until you are in the water.

This is a piece of history, worth seeing as an interesting and provocative documentary, worth seeing as a testament to Werner and his work, worth seeing as a springboard to creating new possibilities in your own life.

For those of us who have taken that action and participated in Landmark Education, it is a touching, moving and inspiring walk with the genius behind the transformation we are now generating for ourselves, our families, our communities and our world.  Personally, I walked into the Landmark Forum wanting to change me for me, my life, and I walked out of the Landmark Forum creating the possibility of living life powerfully, and living a life I love, in a world that works for everyone, no one left out.",1222214400,6,2560,4.53695652173913

I wish it had gone on and on, especially seeing Werner in action in the seminars.  I highly recommend it.

It was fascinating to hear about what went into what is now the Landmark Forum and other programmes put on by Landmark.  The revelations about how members of the Scientology Church actively set out to damage the reputation of Mr Erhard are well worth watching, if only so you can be clear and complete about the guy who founded it all.

I remembered participating in some of these seminars back in the late 80's and much of the thinking Erhard compiled into his seminar products had a powerful impact on the participants. This documentary sets straight in a good way some of the concepts that typically have been misunderstood and portrayed in a distorted way by media. Thanks for the extras footage from the Training. Clearly more footage from those early seminars showing Erhard and others in their prime days deserve to become available to the world. I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Erhard ""makes the blow disappear"". It's clear to realize how the issues dealt with 30 years ago in those trainings continue to be as valid for humans today although today more people are aware of how to handle them, and I think that's a legacy. The DVD is mostly an affair for those who have any experience of the work, but I guess also those totally new to the whole thing could find something to think about from watching it.",1214784000,15,1004,4.7102272727272725

3116487,5,B0013LRKQ2,"I would have preferred a video with more sensationalism. Robyn Symon reveals how The Church of Scientology systematically discredited Werner Earhard and how mass media only covered the scandal and didn't care when the accusation were proven false. I get off on those kind of stories which can be found in this hard hitting documentary.

Instead, this 77 minute documentary gives you the building block technology of transformation, the ideas and methods that have retooled modern western business and quantum learning.

The bonus material includes shockingly candid scenes straight from est. If you ever wondered what the big hoopla about Landmark Education's The Forum, you can now see the technology in action. You can watch how Werner separates a participant from their story, an identity that had been holding them prisoner. This video teaches you how to use your mind for a change that will give you completion of your past so that you are present and responsible for yourself in a new way.

Of course the video is not without its detractors. Critics of The Forum discuss how Werner is discussed as victimizing the victimized and compounding their pain. Others hold that this process is the key to letting go of the authentic benefits of being a victim.

This video is not for the intellectually squeamish.",1212796800,31,1311,5.027649769585254

When I think of him, I am moved to tears--not because of a fawning cult figure adoration. Like myself, I am aware of his many human flaws and failures. I am moved to tears because when I remember Werner Erhard, I remember who I am.

I remember how I hated my mother and father and had little contact with them for 12 years. After doing the est Training & The 6-Day Course, I began getting to know them for the first time. As a result, my father ended up being the ""best man"" at my wedding 25 years ago. How do you thank a person for something like that?",1212364800,45,647,4.217741935483871

The DVD tells us that the daughter recanted but doesn't give any more information. The DVD is an interesting testimonial to a man who indeed had a tremendous influence in the country--but in the end, it side-stepped the opportunity to give clsoure and to put to rest once and for all the bad legends that drove this man out of this country.",1212278400,12,668,4.483606557377049

I found the excerpts of the actual est trainings (which I never took at the time) to be the most interesting part of the film.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more focus on Werner's life story aside from his transformational work.  I ask myself, why him?  What in his past made him the one to create this world of transformation vs. someone else who might have?  The film could have also been a little faster paced for my taste.  Finally, I think the film would have been more well rounded if it had focused less in the last act on how Werner doesn't get the credit he deserves for the difference he made in the world.  While this is almost certainly true, it is also not the point (I would suggest that the net result of the difference he made in the world is) and Werner strikes me as the kind of person who probably doesn't care too much about the credit.

I have deeply valued the impact of the learning I gained from participating in est and Landmark over the years, and am grateful to the film for reconnecting Werner to the American public. He wasn't and isn't a cult leader. He is a guru in the plain and simple sense of extraordinary thinker and teacher, and he is inspirational in the sense of getting me and others off our behinds and out of our minds (joke), and active and effective in our commitments to a better working world, starting with ourselves in our families.

Normally, the world first puts it's heroes on a pedestal, and then history tries to derail them by discussing their weaknesses and humanity. Werner Erhard is the opposite. His contemporaries tried to derail his work by discussing his weaknesses and humanity. History will reveal this human being for the true hero he was and is. Heroes are ""ordinary people with extraordinary commitments.""

Seeing this film, while bringing up many feelings of nostalgia (man, could the world use the training as it was, not the watered down version that is now Landmark), but more importantly it revealed to me just how powerful and right-on-target the training was in delivering the truth that, THIS IS IT, just as it is, here and now.
  As someone who always viewed the training as something that kick-started my spiritual journey through a host of disciplines and teachers (Zen, Taoism, Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti, etc.), I have come to appreciate that Werner delivered the unfiltered 'truth' in just 40 hours, and gave everyone who did the training the opportunity for awakening. Sometimes, some time has to go by before we truly appreciate what we were given, and now, from this vantage point 37 years later, I can see clearly the brilliance of what was given in the training, and the ways in which it works in my life on a daily basis.

3350896,1,B0013LRKQ2,"I was 1 year old in 1971 and so my knowledge of est is from a child's eyes; I heard stuff about it growing up. So I was looking to learn something in this documentary. However, it was primarily a fan's tribute film, attempting to resurrect Werner Erkard's reputation (note that the wikipedia article on him mirrors this film, so some unified pr appears to be going on). Among the litany of vague platitudes of how great the training was from former participants and scholars who admire Werner, there were, I believe only two sound bites from ""est critics"" who threw some really softball items out that were quickly dismissed. So after the ""EST WAS GREAT!"" tribute, I assumed the film would cover the allegations that this was a cult, that there was brain washing involved, that psychologists deplored the group dehumanization techniques, that it tore apart families, and that he apparently became a billionaire through est. All these topics were glossed over. Even the fact that he abandoned his wife and four children (leaving them for his mistress, the film failed to mention), was turned into a glowing, positive story where one of the adult children said that seeing him in the driveway after 13 years, ""it was as if he never left."" The positive thing I can say about the film is the archival footage from Erhard's est trainings - it was fascinating and shocking to see the way the participants were verbally assaulted, and broken down, unable to talk, walk, eat, use the bathroom etc for 10 hours at a stretch. ""But the doors weren't actually locked, though people accused us of this"" was the justification. Then the filmmaker had an amazing potential for great longitudinal scenes - she found some of the people who were featured in the archival footage, decades earlier, as the est participants who were being yelled at by Werner. Couldn't the film have explored if these dehumanizing techniques were really needed for participants to ""get it""? Werner is more mellow these days and doesn't yell - why not? Did he intentionally abandon the profanity-hurling drill sgt routine, and if so why? He was interviewed in a beautiful looking home - but what was the deal with the money? No discussion of his billionaire status. It opened more questions for me than it answered and when I try to find websites with more content, I see notices from Werner's lawyers listed as updates on blog entries. So I can only assume the filmmaker only had access to the archival footage by telling the story he wanted to be told and that he is controlling the revisionist account now.

3350902,5,B0013LRKQ2,Great video on what Werner Erhard has been up to since he left the United States.  Great man who has never received much credit for the enormous difference he has made with his earlier transformational programs and starting Landmark Education,1293148800,4,242,5.05
3350930,2,B0013LRKQ2,"Whatever happened to fair and balanced? Did Werner produce this documentary? What about the people who had nervous breakdowns after attending his seminars, the marriages that fell apart, the friendships that ended, etc. There is no doubt that some people have benefited from EST. But the techniques used are dangerous, and the fact that a person's life is 'transformed' is not the sole measure of whether this seminar is good or not. If, through hypnosis, you achieve great things in life you must ask yourself: who exactly did the achieving? In a sense your personality no longer belongs to you. Am I making any sense? When you join an organization of like-minded people it can be very empowering. You are no longer alone in the world; other's share your values, and encourage and help you. That's all to the good. But those who are not true believers are shunned; there's no getting around it. This is the great flaw in all religions and is particularly dangerous when the belief denies the validity of other beliefs. It's also a spiritual ponzi scheme. You convince two people that you have THE ANSWER. They each convince another two people, so two becomes four becomes eight, etc. Meanwhile, the guy at the top is raking in the dough. Oh yeah, it's a BUSINESS and it ain't cheap to sign up.

The successor to EST is the Landmark Forum. They have been banned in France, as it is considered a dangerous cult.

This is not, I repeat, not an objective documentary.",1278892800,11,1464,4.71484375

It was fabulous to see various views on the educational and transformational work that Werner Erhard began and a bit of historical context. If you ever wondered about the Est Training or you did it and wondered about the guy who founded it, this video is definitely for you. It was also great to watch the film with a group of people who had done some of the transformational education, either as the Est Training or the Landmark Forum which is produced by Landmark Education. There is also a relatively new website for people who participated in the Est Training. You can read and post shares at [...]

3350936,5,B0013LRKQ2,"While I did not purchase this DVD I did have an opportunity to watch it recently.  I found it facinating to see what all of the fuss was about.  I was a kid in the 1970's and only heard about the Est training in passing never really knowing much about what it was.  This documentary definitely gives a clear picture of era of the Est training and explains a lot about how it was recieved.  It also sheds light on why peeople loved it and also why some people hated it.  Seeing the Est training footage and knowing that nearly a million people did it explains a lot about how American culture got from ""Leave it to Beaver"" uptight to ""Will and Grace"" self expression.

While I have heard from some people that it did not go enough into how the training worked or the controversey surrounding Werner Erhard, I found it to be very illuminating of both; the good and the ugly.  In an age of 24 hour pundit news stations and blogs, it is self-evident that everyone has an opinion about everything.

We all know what they say about opinions....  (They are like _______; everyone has got one.)

Now I know what the first line of the Est training was getting at.

I think anyone would find this documentary interesting  esppecially those want to learn what the the fuss was all about.",1253232000,4,1276,4.405982905982906

The DVD arrived in excellent condition and played without any proble,s.  The only issue that I had at all was that the DVD arrived EXTREMELY late.  I placed my order a week before my dad's birthday and paid for express delivery, but the DVD did not arrive until about five days AFTER his birthday.  I have had issues with late deliveries with virtually every order I've placed on amazon.com, so will be the last order that I place here.",1252108800,,565,4.446601941747573
3350938,3,B0013LRKQ2,"On the one hand, this movie is intended for ""original ESTies"" who would like to know where Werner Erhard ended up and enjoy some reminiscing, or need some picture-booking to show their kids.
On the other hand, it strives to generate curiosity about W.E. and the current incarnation of his trainings in Landmark Education.
I found that two essential elements are underrepresented: The actual teachings or ""ideas"" of Werner Erhard are not given enough room in the film. For long stretches there is just enough evidence and claim to make people curious, while in some moments the audience is overwhelmed with unclear concepts (such as the sequence in which the audience is flashed with ""distinctions"").
The second is the ""controversy"" around W.E., to which neither he himself nor other news sources are sufficiently cited.
The story around his family is very ""touching and inspiring"", but a chance is missed to clear up what really happened to a sufficient degree.
Can the activities of Scientology in W.E.s demise be more clarified and substantiated?
Why do we not learn more about the reasons he can not come back into the U.S.?
Also, the film does not produce a sufficient amount of transparency on Landmark education, which is repeatedly mentioned, praised, and prominently represented by Forum Leader Randy McNamara.
Where did and does all the money that EST and L.E. made and make end up?
How do Landmark's expensive advanced courses such as the ""Wisdom Course"" fit into the equation?
The Film buys into Werner's story - and in the end, that story is a story as made up as everyone else's.",1234656000,7,1592,4.921933085501859
3350939,3,B0013LRKQ2,"I enjoyed this DVD. I experienced the Forum and believe I am somewhat better for it. I think the DVD is well made. It is a bit short and I think that it skimmed the surface. It did seem a bit of a biased sales job. Those of us involved know that there are other issues with the trainings and the organization other than sometimes people came away feeling responsible for ""creating"" the tragedies of their lives. I think, this film did present mostly true information, focusing on the positive. Some of the opinions expressed seem to overdo it (is Werner Erhard really an important philosopher?), but these are presented as opinions so you cannot argue with them. Also it is important to remember that not everyone had a positive experience. I believe a lot of people had very positive experiences, but the training is not all that special  in my view and obfuscates some times more than clarifies, If you don't get it, of course, it is your responsibility assh***. If good things happen, you can credit the training.",1231459200,6,1016,4.644444444444445
3350976,3,B0013LRKQ2,"This is a fun doc for us aging est-heads (I'm afraid if I use the proper term my review will get bleeped by Amazon :-D) who've been wondering what the heck Werner has been up to all these years. But wouldn't it be nice to see some biographical material on Werner Erhard by someone who is sympathetic to Werner without being a fawning true believer who insists on making him look like a saint?

I lived in San Francisco, loved est as well as The Forum, and had friends who were in Werner's inner circle back in the day. He may or may not have abused his daughters -- I tend to believe he did not, at least not the way it was portrayed on ""60 Minutes"" -- but let's be real, the man has some skeletons in his closet (or his warehouse of designer clothes, as the case may be).

Along with Richard Nixon, Werner Erhard is one of the most interesting characters of the last half of the 20th century. He is also a serious and influential thinker who risks fading into obscurity as a caricature, a silly icon of the ""me generation."" For my money, a documentary about him would be far more captivating if it were to portray him as he really is: a three-dimensional human being, warts and all.

By not doing that, restricts its appeal to a relatively tiny audience of aging hippies nostalgic for the glory days of est. And that's a shame.",1225670400,33,1328,4.304
3350977,5,B0013LRKQ2,"And it isn't Werner, at least not alone.  He is transformation in the flesh, but the message of his work is so are you.  Each and all of us has a place in this world and we get to CHOOSE what that place is.  In the world of transformation there isn't any sitting and waiting for your purpose to reveal itself.  Life is occurring, now, and again now, and continues to moment by moment, and transformation, for an individual, a family, a community, A WORLD, can occur in a single moment.

I have worked with some of the greatest in the field of human development, Anthony Robbins, Richard Bandler, Tad James, Dr. Dave Dobson, but I have not had the opportunity to work directly with Werner, so this film intrigued me.  As a graduate of the Landmark Forum and Advanced Course, as well as numerous ongoing courses offered by Landmark throughout the world, I was curious about the man behind the technology.

Each and every time Werner is speaking in the film, I get the power that is transformation as it is being generated by a human being simply by who they are being as they are speaking.  If you can get the power of the spoken word, and then take it to another level of speaking only with intention, and then take it to another level of speaking from your commitment, not your ""personality"", how you feel, how your body feels, what's going on around you - if you could only imagine what kind of clarity, focus, authenticity is required to live a life in this manner, you begin to touch on the gift this man has given to the world. It is awe inspiring.

From the outside looking in, the work of est and Landmark Education can never be fully experienced.  It is something that requires action, a single action, and that is to participate in the Landmark Forum.  You will never have the experience of swimming until you are in the water.

This is a piece of history, worth seeing as an interesting and provocative documentary, worth seeing as a testament to Werner and his work, worth seeing as a springboard to creating new possibilities in your own life.

For those of us who have taken that action and participated in Landmark Education, it is a touching, moving and inspiring walk with the genius behind the transformation we are now generating for ourselves, our families, our communities and our world.  Personally, I walked into the Landmark Forum wanting to change me for me, my life, and I walked out of the Landmark Forum creating the possibility of living life powerfully, and living a life I love, in a world that works for everyone, no one left out.",1222214400,6,2560,4.53695652173913
3350978,5,B0013LRKQ2,I did the est Training and then the Landmark Forum years ago before moving to a small rural community.

I wish it had gone on and on, especially seeing Werner in action in the seminars.  I highly recommend it.

It was fascinating to hear about what went into what is now the Landmark Forum and other programmes put on by Landmark.  The revelations about how members of the Scientology Church actively set out to damage the reputation of Mr Erhard are well worth watching, if only so you can be clear and complete about the guy who founded it all.  Personal attacks from what appear to be more members of the Scientology Church continue, even in the reviews of this DVD, I see.",1214870400,33,580,4.504761904761905
3350981,4,B0013LRKQ2,"I enjoyed viewing this. I remembered participating in some of these seminars back in the late 80's and much of the thinking Erhard compiled into his seminar products had a powerful impact on the participants. This documentary sets straight in a good way some of the concepts that typically have been misunderstood and portrayed in a distorted way by media. Thanks for the extras footage from the Training. Clearly more footage from those early seminars showing Erhard and others in their prime days deserve to become available to the world. I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Erhard ""makes the blow disappear"". It's clear to realize how the issues dealt with 30 years ago in those trainings continue to be as valid for humans today although today more people are aware of how to handle them, and I think that's a legacy. The DVD is mostly an affair for those who have any experience of the work, but I guess also those totally new to the whole thing could find something to think about from watching it.",1214784000,15,1004,4.7102272727272725

If you were left with a bad taste in your mouth, from the 60 Minutes ""expos"" in the 1990's, you owe it to yourself to watch this video and see what really happened and what he has been up to since then.",1213142400,6,332,4.045454545454546
3350984,5,B0013LRKQ2,"I would have preferred a video with more sensationalism. Robyn Symon reveals how The Church of Scientology systematically discredited Werner Earhard and how mass media only covered the scandal and didn't care when the accusation were proven false. I get off on those kind of stories which can be found in this hard hitting documentary.

Instead, this 77 minute documentary gives you the building block technology of transformation, the ideas and methods that have retooled modern western business and quantum learning.

The bonus material includes shockingly candid scenes straight from est. If you ever wondered what the big hoopla about Landmark Education's The Forum, you can now see the technology in action. You can watch how Werner separates a participant from their story, an identity that had been holding them prisoner. This video teaches you how to use your mind for a change that will give you completion of your past so that you are present and responsible for yourself in a new way.

Of course the video is not without its detractors. Critics of The Forum discuss how Werner is discussed as victimizing the victimized and compounding their pain. Others hold that this process is the key to letting go of the authentic benefits of being a victim.

This video is not for the intellectually squeamish.",1212796800,31,1311,5.027649769585254

I am moved to tears because when I remember Werner Erhard, I remember who I am.

I remember how I hated my mother and father and had little contact with them for 12 years. After doing the est Training & The 6-Day Course, I began getting to know them for the first time.
