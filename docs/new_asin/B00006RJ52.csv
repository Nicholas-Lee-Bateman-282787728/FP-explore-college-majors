8605827,3,B00006RJ52,"Get the Blue Planet series if you are serious about wanting the full experience. You will see repetition between this and Blue Planet.
Good for general interest. Some spectacular shots. Not enough fish. The Great Barrier Reef is especially disapointing if you wanted lots of underwater life although what's there is beautiful.
Each DVD tries to tell a story when I'd rather concentrate on the wildlife. Consider this if you want a light treatment and have a big screen TV to watch it on.
Specific species covered well: blue whale, great white shark. Hawaii pictures are beautiful.",1053043200,3,580,4.989690721649485
