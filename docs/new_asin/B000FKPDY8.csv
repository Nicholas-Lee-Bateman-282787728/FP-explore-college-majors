2570711,3,B000FKPDY8,"Don't get me wrong... I love Shirley Temple movies!  And I was really pleased with the first volume in the series (which included Heidi, Curly Top, and Little Miss Broadway).  But I had a few problems with this second set.

The colourization is not as good as in the first set.  Perhaps it is harder to colour the earlier films, as their quality is not as good to begin with (two of the films in this set are from 1934).  In Bright Eyes, sometimes the people's skin looked a little too saturated.

The sound on Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm was dismal.  I know it isn't so bad in the original (or at least in other releases) because I have this one on video and the sound is fine.  But certain bits of the dialogue were almost silent... and when you turned up the volume so you could hear them, you were nearly blasted out of your chair when the next scene came along.

But they are cute movies and really show Shirley in some of her most entertaining roles.  Aside from the sound problems, this is a pretty good set (the colourization is a minor issue... I prefer to watch these movies in black and white anyway, and these restored versions are pretty good).",1134864000,27,1156,4.359813084112149

2570828,4,B000FKPDY8,"This box set contains three of Shirley Temple's all-time classic hits.  Depression era audiences adored the antics of this talented moppet, now we can introduce the magic of Shirley to a new generation of fans!  Includes:

BRIGHT EYES:
Shirley Temple's first big movie, tailored especially for her, in which she plays the darling of a group of aviators. Shirley Blake (Temple) is a little tomboy who loves to hang around the airport with her pilot godfather 'Loop' (James Dunn). Her widowed mother Mary (Lois Wilson) works as a maid to the snooty Smythe family, where Shirley must contend with bratty Joy (Jane Withers). When an horrific accident leaves Shirley orphaned, 'Loop' sets out to adopt her but soon discovers he is only one of many who want to take home the adorable moppet.  Shirley shines in her first big role; Jane Withers is hilarious as the antithesis to Shirley's sweetness (""There ain't no Santy Claus, 'cause my psychoanalyst told me"").

BABY TAKE A BOW:
Shirley was reunited with ""Bright Eyes"" co-star James Dunn for this lighthearted caper comedy.  When little Shirley Ellison's (Temple) ex-con father is accused of stealing expensive jewels from his employer, Shirley runs to the rescue!

REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM:
Despite it's title, REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM is not a re-telling of the classic Kate Douglas Wiggin story.  Temple plays Rebecca Winstead, a young radio singer who is discovered by talent scout Tony Kent (Randolph Scott). There's only one hitch: Rebecca's frosty Aunt Miranda (Helen Westley) who isn't about to have her niece go into showbusiness!  Shirley is surrounded by some of her familiar co-stars (Jack Haley, Gloria Stuart, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson); and the musical score includes ""Happy Endings"", and ""Come and Get Your Happiness"".",1246752000,2,1784,5.166666666666667

FORTUNATELY, I previewed it first.  My how things have changed.  When this was made, decades ago, smoking was popular, as was the theme of losing ones Dad, then shortly after, MOTHER get's hit by a bus while bringing home a beautiful birthday cake for little Shirley-there are the wicked, and hateful playmates that make her life a living hell, and the final scene is priceless.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  The designated ""BRAT"" says something cheeky to her prissy mother who gives the child a resounding SLAP across the face as the movie ends and the credits roll.  The best use of this movie would be as a study and commentary piece in a class for future story-writers/and movie producers who want to do a historical review on what was the norm during certain periods of history.  I didn't give this to my grandaughter.  It did not model the best in people at all.",1505779200,,1038,4.633879781420765
8124309,5,B000FKPDY8,"Bright Eyes, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Baby Take a Bow are packaged here in their own individual discs in a box pack.  What a remarkable child star Shirley Temple was.  I first saw a movie of hers in the early 1960's as a child myself and thought she was amazing.  There were two movie firsts with Shirley Temple movies.  She was the world's first child star and she was the first to dance with a great African American star of vaudeville and then screen, 'Bojangles"" Johnson.  Their duets are not only memorable but a delight to watch.  Temple was truly a child prodigy, with an IQ of around 155 and she never fluffed her lines.  She also memorized everyone else's lines and was quick to remind them when they fluffed.  President Roosevelt thought highly of Shirley Temple since her movies were a temporary escape for so many during the pain of the Great Depression.  Baby Take a Bow was rather controversial at the time, since it featured the child  (played of course by Temple) living in a perceived criminal environment.  These movies will always be a joy to watch and Temple will always hold her own as the most amazing and gifted young child in early movie history.
