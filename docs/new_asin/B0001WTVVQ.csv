I should add, I have a hundred or so DVD's of seventies movies that I continue to enjoy. This almost looks like someone filmed a televised broadcast of this movie with a VHS camera.",1515888000,,271,4.230769230769231

8017576,4,B0001WTVVQ,"STUNTS opens w/ a pair of black-gloved hands that are obviously up to no good, as they mess around w/ a helicopter's safety line. Next, a stuntman attempts his latest stunt, only to die in a fall from that very same helicopter! Splat! Enter the stuntman's brother, Glen Wilson (Robert Forster- ALLIGATOR, JACKIE BROWN), who shows up to find out what really happened. Unsurprisingly, he's a stuntman too. Along the way, Wilson picks up a stranded reporter, named BJ Parswell (Fiona Lewis- THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN), who decides to stick around. Wilson uncovers evidence that his brother's death may not have been so accidental after all. Soon, Wilson's stuntman friends begin experiencing tragic ""accidents"". While not overly thrilling, STUNTS does hold its own as a murder mystery. Forster is as good as ever. Co-stars Joanna Cassidy (BLADERUNNER) and Richard Lynch (GOD TOLD ME TO, BAD DREAMS)...  P.S.- Extra points for the world's most groovi-licious theme song! Yeah!...",1438646400,,1002,5.22360248447205

8017579,3,B0001WTVVQ,"'Stunts' (1977) stars Robert Forster, Fiona Lewis, Ray Sharkey, Joanna Cassidy, and the unforgetable Richard Lynch. 'Stunts' centers around the character played by Robert Forster who comes to manage the stunts on a movie set after his brother is killed performing a stunt for the same movie. He, of course, suspects foul play but does a pretty lame job of investigting as this movie focuses (no pun intended) on the stunts and the stuntmen. Fiona Lewis plays a magazine writer doing an article on stuntmen. Ray Sharkey and Joanna Cassidy play stuntmen, and Richard Lynch plays the effects coorinator. As a mystery this is pretty lame and frankly the guilty party and their motive are obvious. This however is a movie about stuntmen and really makes no pretense about being a mystery; it just uses the murder as a plot device. As an action film it is entertaining and does give an interesting, if not overly simplistic, behind the scenes glimpse of some of the most valued people in film-making whose job it is not to be seen. A nice touch was to list the actual stuntmen in the opening credits. 'Stunts' does, in my opinion, accomplish its goal of being entertaining for its 90 minute runtime and I may well watch it again.-Bob",1101513600,6,1227,4.738317757009346
