2516808,1,B000EDWLO6,"I did see the show Kill Reality which aired last year from like August till September and then I waited for this to come out on DVD and here it is and it's BAD!! Basically it's about a woman (Trish Schneider) who finds her boyfriend (Bob Guiney) in bed with another chick (Trishelle Cannatella) and winds up in the hospital in a coma like state. Years later she is still in there and a new couple (Jenna Lewis and Steven Hill) have just moved into the old house. People start to die by the spirit of Trish because their all lying and cheating on the ones they love. What will happen? Well, if you wanna find out be my guest but I do not recommend this movie, it's not campy fun it's just utter stupidity. Rent Cube or something, at least that was more intelligent then this. Bad acting? Hell yes but there was Ethan Zohn who I thought was the best one out of the whole bunch. If you wanna skip the acting and just watch the nudity, well go right ahead I'm not stopping you. I hate reality TV but I watched Kill Reality to see what kind of movie they were making and gee willikers it was horrible. Mostly all the deaths are retarded and corny...I mean a f**king lava lamp! Plus the eyes appearing on the doors was down right idiotic. Also starring Jonny ""Fairplay"" Dalton, Reichen Lehmkuhl, Tonya Cooley, Toni Ferrari, Stacie Jones UpChurch anbd Jenna Morasca. The director appears (forgot his name, lame director anyway) appears as that ponytailed cop who calls Bob Guiney. ARGHHHHHHH!!!",1146268800,2,1487,4.490774907749078
2516809,2,B000EDWLO6,"I just recently purchased and watched this movie and I must say this... You REALLY have to be a fan of reality tv to endure this terrible flop. It seems that a bad script, bad acting(Except for Ethan from Survior who only gets like 10 lines), and bad production leads to a BAD MOVIE. Not much of a suprise. This movie was absolutly awful. It gets two stars for the fact that Tanya and Trishelle get topless(as does every other female star). If you REALLY REALLY like the stars of reality tv, go for it. Otherwise, its just a waste of money.",1145750400,4,540,4.303921568627451
2516810,4,B000EDWLO6,Great fun watching the reality stars I've grown to love/hate in a movie. The script is clever and kept me guessing. The DVD extras alone made this a great find.,1145059200,,160,4.366666666666666
2516811,5,B000EDWLO6,"If you want a fun dive into the horror genre, check it out. For those that love reality TV, this is the movie for you! I am a huge reality TV fan and it was great seeing some of my old 'stars' get whacked in new and creative ways. For those that DON'T like reality TV, this is ALSO the movie for you! Figure, for every reality star that dies, it's one less show for you to have to worry about! Then you can see your least favorite people on TV get whacked! Either way, it's a win/win situation!

I won't give away the plot but I will say that it is a movie about cheaters getting the fates they deserve. With Ethan Zohn as the standout performance in the movie, all the stars do their best to make the movie that much more entertaining. Directed by Robert Kubilos, the director of over 24 previous films, his ability to manage the egos of the different stars makes the movie a fun romp through the supernatural. Just as important, the movie was co-written by Rob Cesternino (Survivor: Amazon, Survivor: All-Stars), Eric Mittleman (Producer - Comic Book: The Movie and Creature Unknown), and Scott Zakarin (co-producer of Bruce Campbell's 'Man with the Screaming Brain' and producer of Sid Caesar's 'Buried Treasures' DVD's). The three writers put together a story that has an unexpected twist that I had never seen in a horror film before. More importantly, a similar twist was recently used in a big budget production starring Reese Witherspoon!

As a fan of film, this independent film, put together by these creative minds, makes for a new and different movie. Are you going to experience special effects the likes of which are seen in $100 million dollar big budget effects films will make? No. But, with the modest budget that this film was put together for, you will get an entertaining movie that does not have to give up creative integrity to the men in the 'suits' behind SAG movies. Is the acting the quality of $50 million dollar stars? No. But, remember, these are reality stars trying to show their stuff in many of their first forays into movie production and they act their hearts out. Do not expect Shakespeare, instead, enjoy the movie for what it is, a modest budget creation of movie producers and directors that want to make a movie that everyone can enjoy. Does this come across in the film, absolutely!

I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of horror films, a fan of reality shows, a non-fan of reality shows, and everyone that enjoys a good popcorn flick! Enjoy!

2516812,5,B000EDWLO6,I love reality television and I was psyched to see a movie with all these crazy lunatics from reality tv.  It's so much fun to see them all die.  Good campy fun!,1142467200,3,161,4.0
8108593,5,B000EDWLO6,"If you are at all into reality TV then you MUST see this movie.  It has it all.  Reality TV star boobage!  Scenes that truly put the ""special"" into ""special effects!""  Something that vaguely resembles tension!  Plenty of boobage!  And, most importantly a puking scene featuring ""Survivor"" alum and Legend of Reality Television, Rob Cesternino!

In short, come for the puking scene, stay for the boobage!",1515715200,,403,5.015151515151516
8108594,1,B000EDWLO6,Bullcrap the movie was missing only came with the extra features disc. Completely missing the first DVD.,1447113600,,104,5.176470588235294

8108596,3,B000EDWLO6,the movie is about what you'd expect. it is campy but entertaining. I would recommend it for those who enjoy campy horror films.,1356912000,,128,4.608695652173913
8108597,2,B000EDWLO6,"Throw some money at reality TV stars and see what you get.  The result?  A low budget attempt at horror. This is something you might find on Cinemax at 1am.  The plot is weak, the acting is horrible, and the shooting isn't incredibly strong.

You must be a strong believer in reality TV to enjoy this movie.",1211932800,,307,4.333333333333333
8108598,1,B000EDWLO6,"I should qualify this review by saying that I'm related to one of the actors in ""The Scorned."" That said, my personal attachment to my relative (who shall remain nameless for the purpose of this review) didn't add to my enjoyment of this movie in the slightest.

Frankly, I'm still looking for a good reason why this movie was made. It was tied to a reality show that aired solely on E! (not exactly the best place to gain visibility). It was then aired on E! (sanitized) and released directly to DVD with very little promotion. After watching it, it's easy to see why the producers tried to forget about it. There are a few average performances (any truly good performances would have been prohibited by a brain-dead script), but for the most part, the ""actors"" noticably fake their way through their lines. Steven Hill and Jenna Lewis appear to at least try to make the most of their lead roles of Oliver and Kirsten, and Trish Schneider, while playing comatose for part of the time, seems to enjoy the villany of her murderous ghost (though so much of the plot involving her seems odd and even silly). But others in the film (particularly Johnny Fairplay and Ethan Zohn) are ludicrous in their attempts to feign acting ability.

All things considered, ""The Scorned"" suffers from substandard acting and directing, has average production values (at best) and one of the worst scripts ever to make it to the screen. Again, that makes it hard to comprehend why it ever saw the light of day. If zero stars were a possibility, I'd seriously consider that, but I'd certainly never consider buying it.",1188432000,,1596,4.696428571428571
8108599,4,B000EDWLO6,"I really loved this movie.  I like to watch a few reality shows, and I was pleasently surprised at how well they acted!  But, some on the other hand, I was embarassed for them bc they were just aweful.  I wish they had the dvd series of Kill Reality.  Those episodes leading up to the movie make it easier to understand.  (plus, it was entertaining!)  Let me know if the series box set will ever come out.  I'd totally get it!",1186790400,,426,4.185185185185185
8108600,2,B000EDWLO6,"I didn't think that The Scorned was really all that bad.  The story line kept moving and never got bogged down.  While the acting wasn't worthy of Shakespeare, I've definitely seen worse.

You get to see a LOT of good flesh, which makes up for some of the show's shortfalls.

But the thing that really makes this DVD worth it is the behind the scenes extras.  Think you've seen a Hollywood hissy-fit?  Watch this one.",1178064000,,417,4.493333333333333
8108601,1,B000EDWLO6,The only reason I bought it was cause my friend Reichen was in it.. And man was it horrible.. I am really hoping that my boy doesn't put this on his resume.. You will laugh on how bad the acting is and how Jenna M bites it... I love the crazy guy though.. the only one that actually acted in the movie... lots of T&A though.,1174003200,3,324,3.9242424242424243
8108602,2,B000EDWLO6,"The only way this film MIGHT be enjoyable is if these no talent, over-exposed reality ""stars"" really were killed.  Seriously...who came up with this idea and can we possibly have them deported?  Is someone really into reality TV that much that they care to see these people as (bad) actors?  I guess a few are...

Anyway, a murder in a beach house leaves a woman named Raina dead with her throat cut.  She becomes a vengeful spirit who is out to kill unfaithful lovers.  Months later she finds a treasure trove as a whole group of people move in who are unfaithful to each other.  This list of stars includes Jenna Lewis, Jenna Morasca, Ethan Zohn, and Johnny Fairplay from ""Survivor"", Bob Guiney from ""The Bachelor"", Trishelle Cannatella, Tonya Cooley, and Steven Hill from ""The Real World"", Stacie Jones Upchurch from the Apprentice, Erika Landin from ""Big Brother"", and so on and so forth...There's also a boatload of cameos by other reality stars like Nikki McKibbin, Gervase Peterson, yadda yadda....

It seems the main goal of the film was to stuff as many of these never-was-beens into a movie and if that was the goal then it was a success.  The film comes off as a fan-boy project.  It was written by another Survivor alum Rob Cesterino and Rob might want to look for another deserted island to move to because I don't think he'll have many people knocking on his door.

Guiney who plays the beach houses landlord and Zohn actually don't come off to bad.  I suppose you could see them scratching out a living acting.  As for the rest, well they pretty much were very bad and I hope none of them took the film too seriously.",1149638400,5,1632,4.586206896551724
