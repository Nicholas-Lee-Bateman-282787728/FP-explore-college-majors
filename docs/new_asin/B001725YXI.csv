3715037,5,B001725YXI,"Yes I am back. Insomnia gone. I still have my disorders but hey its not a cure-all quick service.
Time and practice are needed. Be patient and do not rush the technique. Follow through and execute each step.
Also work at your own pace...it gets easier with practice.",1386374400,,266,4.5625
3715038,3,B001725YXI,"This is a fantastic video for someone who is a more seasoned practitioner of yoga who has no low back or neck injuries (or who knows how to modify for them). This video provides absolutely zero in the way of instruction- even the next pose isn't announced verbally, but rather with a picture of the pose and it's name. The music is peaceful, the flow is well paced. If you are someone who already has a good grasp of yoga and are just in want of a new sequence, this is the video for you! If you are someone who is going to need or desire /any/ kind of instruction whatsoever, look up 'Yin Yoga' or 'Restorative Yoga' and you will find a fairly decent selection.",1370736000,8,662,4.261904761904762
3715039,1,B001725YXI,Video is a waste of money. No instruction or explanations. The poses are too advanced for the average practitioner. I feel ripped off. Got nothing out of it.,1326499200,11,157,4.642857142857143
8326171,5,B001725YXI,it works.,1463702400,,9,4.0
8326172,1,B001725YXI,Not what I was expecting at all...no talking and timer went off to change positions...a little strange for me.,1442448000,,110,4.842105263157895
8326173,4,B001725YXI,"Amazing. I love this series of videos because it shows the poses and has soothing music and cues for chimes. No fancy backgrounds, which actually help me to clear my mind and focus on simple meditations. I feel so relaxed and ready for bed!",1441238400,,240,4.4772727272727275
8326174,3,B001725YXI,Not enough instructions throughout the sequence so you have to constantly be looking at the TV screen to follow.,1438560000,,112,4.947368421052632
8326175,5,B001725YXI,"Those familiar with common yoga poses and who have muscular flexibility (or are familiar with modifications for limited flexibility) may find this video alone helpful in preparing for sleep.  I appreciate the lack of verbal instructions, as well as the pace and chimes signaling the end of one pose and beginning of the next.

For those unfamiliar with the poses, ""the first video in the series (Yoga: Mind Body Connection) is about 2 hours long and will teach you the asanas (poses/postures) used throughout the series.""  See Lethe's review below.",1437782400,3,548,5.066666666666666
8326176,5,B001725YXI,"This is a short video in a series.  The first video in the series (Yoga: Mind Body Connection) is about 2 hours long and will teach you the asanas (poses/postures) used throughout the series.  The rest of the shorter videos, of which this is one, will simply demo a sequence of the particular asanas that will target the problem identified in the video title.  You do NOT get verbal instructions or coaching in this 20 minute video.  Go to the first video for that.  Here you get a presentation of the specific asanas ""that address the imbalances causing disorders [ in this case insomnia and sleep disorders] and helping to reverse them.""  That said, I think this is one of the best targeted yoga series' out there.",1427068800,8,716,4.5984251968503935
8326177,3,B001725YXI,"I was excited to try this video but disappointed. There is no explanation in the video as to why the poses would be helpful or breathing during each pose. There is no explanation into the ""how to get into the positions"". Yes, an individual shows you, but in the case of one of them, there appears to be a sequence and I'm not sure the differences in where your arms, head, and feet go are really clear without some dialogue. The changes are subtle and nuanced. The video could be more helpful with a little intro some occasional dialogue and potentially a ""how to do this if you're new to yoga"" or some of the more difficult poses. I gave it a 3 because I can see where each one of these poses can help, but it could use some work. Plus, a novice to yoga will get frustrated and turn it off pretty quickly, I think.",1410652800,,815,4.197452229299363
8326178,1,B001725YXI,"Thank goodness I viewed this for free on Amazon Prime!  The only audio is music (that might put you to sleep on its own).  No instruction at all - just people going slowly thru the poses with a chime to tell you its time to move on to the next pose.  Many of the poses are impossible to do if you are not incredibly flexible, or if you have a knee replacement like I do.",1389225600,5,370,3.9066666666666667
8326179,5,B001725YXI,"I am a total beginner in yoga practice and I do agree that you must have some idea of the basics of yoga. As a subscriber to Amazon Prime I have practiced with several beginner yoga videos so I knew to allow myself to completely relax and just practice the poses as they were presented. They say as a general rule that yoga should NEVER hurt so I used my basic instincts to improvise during more challenging poses. For example, I used a couple of stacked pillows to rest my head during poses where I couldn't reach the floor. I didn't bend my knees all the way over my head because I know I'm not in shape for that YET;-) But, if you try just quietly and gently following the ""models"", listening to the very calming flute music, and avoid focusing on perfection, but RELAXATION instead, you might find yourself nearly falling asleep while doing the video like I did! I also caught on to listen for the ""tingling"" music sound cues to look up and see the next pose that was coming but if I was really relaxed in a certain pose I took my time with it.  I highly recommend this video for anyone that is okay with someone modeling the way and not speaking it.",1389052800,4,1154,4.293577981651376
8326180,1,B001725YXI,It essentially consists of watching someone do various yoga poses.  There is almost no dialogue/verbal instruction.  There is no verbal cue that they will be switching to a new asana.  Very unhelpful.,1388534400,,200,5.1875
