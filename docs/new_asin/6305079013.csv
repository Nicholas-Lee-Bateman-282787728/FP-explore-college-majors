967358,5,6305079013,"We know where we are - in England - with the songs and music, the looks of these people, the way they dress, the way they look, the faces they make and the faces they have, their violent games and the first jest, and the first joke, sets the action in a fighting ring with a red lady dressed in so much crimson sanguine velvet that she looks like a cardinal, the bird of course.

And the hats, Lord, or the way they dress their hairs. Holbein, Rembrandt and the Flemish school, and yet their inns cum nunneries cum brothels cum stables and a lot of welcoming remarks are real enclosed farcical and at times lethal bordellos. Most festivities take place in big halls. That's England isn't it, cold and rainy, uncertain and wet, at least as for the climate and the weather. The garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and Pan fingering his pipe is not bad at all, looking like a Stonehenge of well trimmed bush pillars.

The most intriguing sequence is that of the homosexuals who are tricked into sex by some agents of the church, but only to be proposed a choice: pay or burn on the griddle. One is rich and goes through. The other is poor and burns. The scene is amplified by the dais and the canopies all around the quadrangle where it happens, by the velvet of the dresses and by the silence, by the kids watching the show, the green lawn of this quadrangle surrounded by Norman or Tudor architecture, the bringing of the faggots by half nude teens before the bringing in of the gay yelling faggot, his being tied on the griddle, the lateness of the priest and his cross and the silence again when the flames finally engulf the man.

And all is seen through the eyes of a bun-vendor who does not say a word and roams behind everyone. And it is all calculated by the local bishop with the help of a consenting youth who plays the bait. And the mute witness is later revealed to be the devil enjoying the show set up for him by the good old Christian men and women. And there we start descending into a Flemish vision of Hell. And Hell is on earth with Charlie Chaplin arriving in the picture, accompanied by the traditional music of his mute films on a pipe, the cops, the cheating at the soup distribution, the cane and the bowler hat, the bored bride in a wedding, the monstrous father of the wimp bridegroom that gets creamed with the wedding cake, the strict family but the cheating mother who feeds bad Charlie in the back of the father, even a job shining, or should I say, polishing eggs, playing dice with what Dickens would have called street Arabs, and Shakespeare scoundrels I guess.

And he introduces us in his dream of a bawdy paradise on earth, interrupted by two cops who arrest him and put him in a pillory. Add to that the flood.

And the red widow strutting across this mess. In England religion has been turned into a business, a sham, a parody, a farce, a social carnival in which a windmill grinds corn without turning its wings, but it does not matter since the miller is a thief. But Chaucer in the film leads us to another inn-brothel of England. And an angel will take you to Hell and you better like devils and Satan and you will discover where all the friars are kept in Hell by Satan himself. You'll drown in a real colic of friars all over the world directly from under the tail of His Lord Satan.

Amen for sure.

967359,5,6305079013,"If you dare venture into the realm of this amazing director, be prepared  and forewarned.  This is not for everyone.  But for those of us who love him, he is extraordinary and no other director has braved the waters that he has.  Visionary and lewd, revolutionary and base, he is not for you if you are looking for Hollywood style flicks.  You simply cannot judge Pasolini by the movies you have seen before.  He is in a world all his own.",1187222400,8,439,4.3580246913580245
967360,2,6305079013,"I've read the Canterbury Tales, so I was expecting lots of toilet humor (nakedness, fart jokes, etc.), but this film seems to take it too far. Their were bits that got a chuckle out of me (the Devil's fart, for example) but altogether they Pasolini seems to have enjoyed putting raunchiness in for its own sake, rather then to further the film.

There was a few good actors, but too many were horrible. They seemed as though they were reading off cue cards, and were not involved in the scene at all.

The screenplay didn't help matters. It was a shoddy adaptation with wooden, unmotivated dialogue. Only a few stories were truly based on Chaucer, others were supposedly juxtaposing several stories into one, it didn't work. Pasolini also threw in some Chaucer but at uneven moments only to have the actors butcher the verse.

Their was some nice cinematography, as far as filming the landscapes, but other then that, relatively insignificant.

Not being aware of Pasolini's reputation before seeing this film (though I have seen 'Il Decameron', which I enjoyed more) allowed me to view the work from one of two ways, either unschooled in his style, or open to making observations without being influenced by his fame.

Either way, I was unimpressed.",1127433600,13,1250,4.849765258215962
967361,1,6305079013,"In the Middle Ages, people generally did not stroll about in brightly colored, shintzy clothes. Especially not when they went on a pilgrimage, ""to seek the holy blissful martyr"". Roads and streets were not paved. People stank. One cannot convey that in a film, but please pay more attention to set decoration? The standard you would like to attain in that respect was set by Terry Gilliam in ""Jabberwocky"": shabby poor people, dirty faces, muddy streets. Or ""The Name of the Rose"".
Besides, you can only follow this movie if you have read the Canterbury Tales first. Otherwise, it's incomprehensible. By the way, almost all Italian movies I re-view of late seem incomprehensible. I used to like Italian cinema, but its products do not seem to age well. The dialogues usually seem hollow and pretentious. One notable exception: ""Kaos"".",1090022400,16,834,5.0071942446043165
967362,3,6305079013,"""The Canterbury Tales"" is second part of Pasolini's 'Trilogy Of Life' but certainly the most innocent, and perhaps dullest, of the three. Based on stories by Chaucer the film has been set in England, however the native tongue has been dubbed in Italian with English subtitles. The stories are fairly adult in nature but mostly harmless unlike Pasolini's shocker, ""Salo"".

967363,1,6305079013,"I read the stories of the Canterbury Tales and was blown away. I saw the movie and was disgusted. The acting is horrible and some of the people are just UGLY. The plot does stick to the tales but if you've read them, you  don't really want to see them enacted. It reminds me of an old cheesy HBO  porn, but that is even giving it too much credit.

7883172,4,6305079013,"A major theme in The Canterbury Tales is the idea of ""quyting,"" or responding to a tale, a form, a genre; Pasolini takes on Chaucer and takes up the task of quitting: he re-imagines the Tales and rewrites them. Remaining true to the text is the least proper way to make the Tales into a film; thus Pasolini makes them his own. His final grin is both an acknowledgment of his vision of the tales and a grin to the Catholic Church after his vision of hell, a tribute to Chaucer and a final poke (medieval pun intended) at the Church. Pasolini remains true to Chaucer's project and makes the Tales present in the way that Chaucer took up Boccaccio, French fabliaux, romance and exempla.

Instead of paying $100-$200 for this version, which is okay - bit not great - let's try to get a proper reissue of this (Criterion, please?), with a better transfer, notes and supplements. This film does not deserve to be left out-of-print.",1304035200,,925,4.538922155688622
7883173,3,6305079013,"Pasolini's second installment in his Trilogy of Life, The Canterbury Tales (I racconti di Canterbury) unfortunately isn't as powerful as The Decameron. The film does have its moments but somehow I found myself losing interest as the film became more tedious.

Based on the famous tales of Geoffrey Chaucer, Pasolini uses the tales as a means to poke fun primarily at the institution of marriage. Pasolini is not as adept here as he was in The Decameron and he does not seem as sure of himself in adapting the material. On the whole this film seems somewhat choppy and I found myself staring at my watch more and more as the film progressed. That is not to say that there is no good material here just that there are long stretches where not much seems to be happening.

I find it hard to really recommend this film because of the obscene price that resellers are getting for it. The lowest price that I can find for the Image release is around $110.00 dollars. The print is washed out and the the sound is weak. It is noted on the box that the print was taken from the best available elements but this is questionable. This is a very bare bones edition that has no special features not even a trailer. It is time for a company like Criterion to take the step of restoring the trilogy.

I'm glad that I've seen this rare film but I cannot really recommend purchasing this edition. I understand that there  are better copies from other regions so that may be the best way to go if you must own this one. Slightly disappointed.",1298592000,2,1524,4.451612903225806
7883174,3,6305079013,"Some people liked this film just because it was made by Pasolini. Well, besides being irreverent and critical of ""the church and the bourgeoisie"", much of the ambience ranges from wrong (there are buildings of an architecture perhaps 400 years off) to ridiculous (Charlie Chaplin? Really?), the ""medieval"" clothes sometimes are plainly grotesque (the men-at-arms, looking like a cross between Darth Vader and the Persians in the 300) and the acting sometimes is simply abysmal. On the other hand, sometimes everything is appropriate, seems to be well researched and properly medieval. Many of Chaucer's stories are nicely rendered in the film. Overall the movie is very uneven, with great parts and others that are simply a disgrace. The much celebrated last scene probably was inspired on Hieronymus Bosch and it may be slightly shocking if you are sort of squeamish. I was expecting much more from this movie, being a film by Pasolini and all.  Chaucer probably would have liked it though.",1296259200,,991,5.117283950617284
7883175,3,6305079013,"This DVD is not the director's cut that won the top prize at the 1972 Berlin Film Festival. That version ran 140 minutes while this one clocks in at 112 minutes. That's almost 30 minutes of missing footage which no doubt explains the choppy quality of the editing and the incoherent nature of some of the stories. I first saw the English language version of this movie when it played in U.S. theaters back in 1980. There was no NC-17 rating back then and so it was rated X. I watched as within the first hour virtually everyone walked out on the film. Those expecting a MASTERPIECE THEATRE version of Chaucer were scandalized (what were they doing at an X rated movie?) and those expecting a porno version of classic literature (remember GRIMM'S FAIRY TALES FOR ADULTS?) didn't get the sex they were looking for. While there were sex scenes, it was the full frontal male nudity that got the X rating (the same as today). That and the infamous ending which still has to be seen to be believed. So does a fully nude, pre-DR WHO Tom Baker in the WIFE OF BATH'S TALE.

If you are familiar with the works of Pier Paolo Pasolini (who plays Chaucer) then the nature and the look of the film will come as no surprise. In addition to being a filmmaker, Pasolini was a poet, a Marxist, a gay rights activist, and a political agitator. It was the last two activities that led to his murder in 1975. His films have a deliberately primitive style that recalls the films of D. W. Griffith and those of Italian Neorealism. Pasolini deliberately used non-professionals in many of his films to achieve the look he wanted and to get ""unaffected"" performances. The film was made in several of Chaucer's English locations giving the stories a real sense of verisimilitude. The fact that Sergio Leone's regular cameraman Tonino Delli Colli was also Pasolini's regular cameraman tells you that Pasolini deliberately wanted a cinema-verite look. Yes the performances are uneven and the dubbing is occasionally haphazard but that doesn't take away from the film's overall effectiveness. The British Film Institute has recently issued a beautiful restoration on DVD & Blu-Ray but it's Region 2 only.",1278288000,4,2174,4.751322751322752
7883176,3,6305079013,"This is the second in Pasolini's series of setting classic bawdy tales to film... In this case, he selected eight of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, including the infamous miller's tale and the incident with the red hot poker kiss...

The tales revolve around a group of pilgrims who are journeying to the shrine of Saint Thomas a Becket of Canterbury... The trip is so boring that they begin telling each other stories that soon get obscene, gory and very sexy... Pasolini adds another motif to his visualization by placing Chaucer himself into the movie, periodically cutting to him writing at his desk...

Pasolini inserts pleasure and amusement at social customs, especially marriage... Some of the stories are funny, others are deadly serious... The scene where a young man is burned for making love to another of his own sex, for example, is chilling...

In fact, Pasolini's using non professional actors, is more in keeping with the tone of the original than the usual romanticized versions...",1232236800,,996,5.060975609756097
