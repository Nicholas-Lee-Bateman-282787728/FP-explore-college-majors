8280180,5,B001AY0FT6,"Yes, OJ Simpson is the most notorious and hated American celeb of all-time. Now that we've gotten that out of the way...
I read an online media review that linked to the [...] website where you can go ahead & stream it if you want, but came here to Amazon instead to score the last DVD... What can I say, I still like having an actual DVD to play and am willing to pay a little extra for it... and had heard about this through the This American Life show after the new FX OJ series got me thinking about the spectacle that is OJ/Trial of the Century.
Here's the gist of it:
I did not know what to really expect, but you will see for yourself this is simply the greatest, most offensive, most mystifying, andit has to be saidmust-watch reality TV show of the past decade. This is a thing that actually existed. This is flabbergasting. This is fascinating. This is so much worse and better than you could even imagine. You really need to watch it. This is Punkd featuring O.J. Simpson almost 10 years after he set fire to the zeitgeist with his murder trial, at a time when 78 percent of Americans believed he probably or definitely was guilty. This is the most notorious man in America, going undercover at a fast-food restaurant and pretending to mess up peoples orders, cheekily chirping, Youve been Juiced! Juiced being a reference to his nickname as a football player.
Has reality TV gone too far? the site teases, unaware it is asking a rhetorical question. You be the judge. It teases the special as starring The Most Notorious Celebrity on the Planet. Are you confused? Yes, that O.J. Simpson! Oh.
Should you think that this peak moment in culture was above capitalizing on Simpsons reputation as a, um, murderer, you neednt fear. No one is safe because THE JUICE is loose, the site promises, ominously. Again. The idea is straightforwardalmost chillingly so.
This isn't an image-rehabbing celebrity comeback, a charming comedy bit meant to erase negative feelings the public may have about its star.
Its your typical hidden-camera show. Simpson would infiltrate some establishment, sometimes in disguise and sometimes not, needling customers to their breaking point before shouting, Youve been Juiced.
It opens with a rap video.
Yes, a rap video.
O.J. Simpson is dressed like a pimp, surrounded by topless dancers who gyrate all over him. He spits lyrics: Dont you know theres no stopping the Juice / When Im on the floor Im like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Dont be stupid, Im not a Simpson named Bart.
The video then shows Simpson in a recording booth, for some reason wearing a curly wig andyes, for the love of goda wife beater. Cut back to the dancing hos. In the first sketch, Simpson pretends to work at the drive-thru window of a fast-food joint. If I pulled up to a window where O.J. Simpson was at, I would not eat that food, says one of his accomplices to the camera. Another: I would go to another restaurant. That Simpson is a scary person is very much the joke. Oh, hijinx ensue. He takes a sip from a drink before giving it to a customer to make sure theres enough ice in it. He asks an overweight woman if shes sure she wants fries. (Get it? Because shes fat.) In one bit where he bullies an employee he says, oh-so charmingly, I think hes a retard. He rubs cheese on his apron before serving the burger to a customer. Health code violations! Youve been Juiced!
In another sketch he dresses as a homeless man and sells oranges on the side of the highwayoranges from O.J.asa meta-commentary on his fallen celebrity? (Just kidding! Theres no deep meaning here.) He pretends to be having an affair with a guys girlfriend. He puts on prosthetics to transform into an old white man who wanted to call a Bingo game before he died. The sketch is called B-I-N-G-O.J.
Through it all, he tells people who have been Juiced that hes the guy from movies like Naked Gun or from the football field. Yes, O.J. Thats what they know you from.
The one truly funny bit, in that it is seriously uncomfortable, involves Simpson pretending to attend an open house. Leon, playing the homeowner, keeps calling Simpson Danny Glover. Simpson, perhaps forgetting its all staged, gets visibly angry. When someone at the open house breaks a vase, Leon asks Simpson if it was him. He says it wasnt: Ive been blamed for enough s***.
At one point a woman in the backyard begins jumping on a trampoline topless. Theres no reason for this. She just is.
Topless women factor prominently into Juiced, dancing on Simpson in acid trip montages that play before and after each sketch as the show transitions between them. You may stare dumbfounded, but its all a warm-up for what is the shows most excellent and most shocking bit.
Simpson goes to a used car lot in Las Vegas and attempts to sell a used white Bronco.
Theres a bullet hole in it. He autographs the Bronco right above it. His pitches to prospective customers read as if from a Saturday Night Live skit. This is a collectors item, he says. It was good for me. Got me out of harms way.
And then the line that will have you fumbling to lift your jaw off its newly permanent residence on the floor: I can guarantee this car has escapeability, he says. If you ever get in trouble and have to get away, this car has escapability.
There are multitudes of cant-make-this-s***-up gems.
But, really, the glory is in watching this beautiful, shameful disaster. This pinnacle of trash TV that simply does not have its due. This treasure that is Juiced.
Easily 5 out of 5 stars - worth every penny. Will have to share this video with your friends, otherwise they will never believe you that it actually exists!",1454284800,,5680,4.569607843137255
