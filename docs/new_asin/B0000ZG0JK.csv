8004881,4,B0000ZG0JK,"This video is a pretty good introduction to Nepal. The host is a young Australian guy with a lot of energy, and the hour-long program is fun to watch and informative.
He begins in Kathmandu, does the whole Everest base camp trek, goes to Nepalganj and Royal Bardia National Park in the western/Terai region, and (perhaps the most culturally interesting) visits a remote village in the Mustang region where he participates in a wedding of five boys to one teenage girl.
My only complaint with the video is that it doesn't include any travel in the Annapurna region, which I would have liked to have seen as that's a popular part of Nepal and the one that I was preparing to visit.
But otherwise it's a nicely produced, up-to-date look at a beautiful country.",1081900800,2,757,4.656716417910448
