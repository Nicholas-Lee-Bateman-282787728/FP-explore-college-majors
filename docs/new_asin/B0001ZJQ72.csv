However, if you haven't read the book, I think the DVD may leave you with many questions because it doesn't go into nearly as much detail as the book does.

2049796,5,B0001ZJQ72,"This DVD is not only informative, it's entertaining as well. The message (using ""toddlerese"" to connect with your child) was consistently relayed, cohesive and universally appealing. We watched real parents dealing with VERY real kids in the kinds of situations we all experience (fighting over toys, going to bed, etc etc). Frankly, I think this DVD should be packaged with Dr. Karp's book ""Happiest Toddler on the Block,"" as it's imperative to watch and know exactly how to use the method (and to do it without feeling as if you're ""teasing"" or speaking down to your child). My husband and I have both watched it and are following Dr. Karp's method. Are we happy? You bet. Our 2-year-old's tantrums have gone down at least 75% (both frequency and duration).",1082851200,35,759,4.891472868217054

Baby's and toddler s understand way more then what the can actually repeat so talking like that is not going to help. They do have a vary short attention span so explain thing in too much detail. I let my child calm down then let them know I understand and care about how they feel then give an appropriate response like it really hard when someone has a toy you want I get really frustrated when someone has something I want to. But look how happy your sister is with it. Should she be sad if you took it from her? What if she took a toy from you how should you feel. That's a little long then what I would really say but I would not say no no no and confuse my child how is he supposed to know if  repeating him or having a fit of my own.

2049815,5,B0001ZJQ72,"Too many of us believe that the terrible twos illustrate spoiled children.  Dr. Karp teaches you respectful parenting which proves that heavy handed discipline is not necessary or even beneficial.  Gentle teaching helps your child develop stronger character, stronger social skills, and resilience.  Respectful and understanding of the fact that children have primitive brains, and are too often lost in a sea of confusion and struggle to communicate.  Although it is a very different way to think about your relationship with your child, it is effective and has long term results.  In fact, these ideas are also useful for your efforts to understand your teenager (teenagers are also developing emotional and communication skills, combined with that stew of hormones (creating emotional havoc.)

Our son (18 months when we first tried it, now 21 months) seems to get more enraged when we use some of these techniques.  I'm not sure, but I think he thinks we're mocking him.  Involving him in doing daily chores (cooking dinner, putting things away, putting things in the trash, closing the fridge door, etc) is helpful in helping stay calm and engaged.  We were doing that already and have had none too many tantrums.  Hopefully it's more of an age/development issue and the caveman language winds up working in time.",1448323200,,673,4.475409836065574

2049832,1,B0001ZJQ72,"What pure drivel...love his first book & video, ""Happiest Baby on the Block"".  That book is so helpful.  This toddler one I feel, after having my own toddlers and also previously a daycare/preschool worker, that this book does nothing but placate to a child's moods & whims.  Yes, simplify your speech to make sure toddler's understand you but how patronizing to treat them like stupid cavemen.  This is a ""one size fits all"" mentality that I avoid.  My oldest as a toddler would have hated being talk to in such a manner.  My now almost 3 yr old only understands you calming him down first.  When I ""match"" him tone & words it makes him more upset because he sees me as the loving authority & he looks to me for guidance.

Children need tons of love and discipline (love & discipline at least being equal at the least the more love the better to make up for discipline) at this age & to act like they just have a right to do whatever they want will lead to trouble as they will refuse to be controlled later.

I see this book leading to some frustrated parents, as a strong-willed child or emotiohally sensotive child would not do well with this method he teaches.",1438214400,7,1165,4.406542056074766

2049836,1,B0001ZJQ72,Don't waste your 12 dollars. We laughed through the whole movie. The idea that the author presents is that toddlers are like cave men and you should talk to them the same way they talk to you. I agree with getting down to their level and making sure they feel heard but if you talk to them like a baby how are they supposed to expand their vocabulary? It's weird!,1423094400,2,363,4.2

2049839,5,B0001ZJQ72,I read the happiest baby on the block when my baby was four months old. As a working & nursing mom I was so sleep deprived & desperate to find a solution. I gave my husband the cliff notes version & day 1 there was such a difference! We have used Dr. Karps methods literally everyday since. I even emailed him asking a question & he emailed me back which was pretty cool to hear back from Dr. Karp himself. Now our baby is 13 months & we're seeing bits & pieces of her toddler phase already. My husband & I watched the happiest toddler on the block the other night before bed & have been trying out what we learned only for the last two days. I can already tell when my daughter is upset & we use his methods she looks at me like 'mommy you understand me!'

But, it really didn't work for our toddler whatsoever.  The premise is that you get down to the level of the toddler (i.e., limited vocabulary and comprehension).  You get into a ""caveman mode"" and verbalize their emotions in very short sentences or one word utterances.  Unfortunately, you sound like an idiot and you provoke the toddler.

I enjoyed this DVD; especially on how to handle a toddler who is pitching a fit in a way that makes you appreciate the child's point of view. I have successfully used the technique where you sort of mimic their frustration on the same level as the toddler at the same time they are throwing their fit (yes, I even used the childish baby voice and everything). It's kind of hard to explain unless you watch the DVD, but the result was that it kind of startled, distracted and stopped her dead in her tracks (not to mention the neighboring diners.) This has worked like a charm for me at home and in restaurants.  You may need to do it several times before they settle down, but I find the trick is to do it before she reaches that ""red zone"" or the point of no return where nothing I do will get her to stop quickly.

Having just finished watching this, the techniques look interesting and we will be trying them out soon.

The production quality on this video, however, was bad to the point of distraction. Most of the video is shot on a hand held camcorder without a tripod, and the shaking throughout is jarring. At one point towards the end (about 1:05), a second camera operator just walks in front of the main camera. The audio is incredibly inconsistent too with many scenes being difficult to hear what they are saying due to tons of background noise (recorded probably with just the microphone mounted on top of the camera). Topping it off, some of the on-screen text has typos in it. Most ""adult movies"" have better production qualities than this.

So while we felt that the content was interesting, it was hard to get the message past the production quality.

2049874,5,B0001ZJQ72,"I have recently conducted a research study evaluating ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block"" parenting strategies with young single mothers. A single subjects multiple baseline design across participants was utilized for this study. Each of the mother's came from a low socioeconomic background and either worked and/or went to school full time. As part of the book and DVD set the participants were also taught to utilize these parenting strategies using instruction, role modeling, and descriptive feedback, as well as in-situ feedback. The first component of this study was to determined if the mothers were able to learn and then implement the strategies during every day routines. The second part of this study evaluated whether the mother's use of the strategies decreased their toddlers challenging behavior. The data demonstrated that mother's use of the strategies remained at low levels during the baseline phase, however increased during the training phases. Also mother's were able to maintain their use of the strategies during the two week follow-up probe. The data also demonstrated a decrease in toddler challenging behavior with increased engagement once the mother's began to use The Happiest Toddler on the Block parenting strategies. A continued decrease in their toddler's challenging behavior remained during the two week follow-up probe as well. There were also several social validity questionnaires that were delivered to both the participants and naive observers. All of the participants rated both the DVD and the strategies high noting a stronger bond between mother and child. In addition, naive observer watched video clips before and after training and rated a noticeable positive difference in child behavior and mother child interactions. As with any study there were limitations. One notable limitation is that along with the book and DVD these participants received one on one instruction with a trained behavioral therapist. Also these strategies were used as a packaged intervention and it is impossible to determine which strategy was the most effective in reducing toddler challenging behavior. To summarize the participants in this study rated ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block"" strategies as parent friendly, easy to implement, and noted a positive change in their toddlers.",1346371200,,2313,5.5

Since swaddling and pacifiers are out the window, there's a whole new array of challenges to deal with that are very tough to find the solutions for...until I discovered this!  The Happiest Toddler helped me UNDERSTAND what was going on inside the brain & emotions of my toddler's development, which helped me create the right expectations for my kids - and thus know how to communicate with them properly.  Using Toddler-ese to speak with them has really eliminated tantrums from the beginning - from the first time I used it and she was awe-struck that it seemed like I really ""got"" her, to the ""new normal"" in our household where I rarely need to start Toddler-ese and the situation is immediately diffused!  I love the lessons of positive reinforcement as well - green lights/red lights have changed our discipline technique 100% - and works for our 5 and 8 year old like magic!  Time-Ins, Feeding the Meter, Playing the Boob...these are all wonderful techniques that every parent should have in their daily wheel-house, my kids and family are DEFINITELY happier as a result!",1337644800,2,1247,4.835680751173709

I purchased both books (Baby and Toddler) for my daughter who is expecting in Sept. His books are my favorite baby shower gifts and I have had all positive feedback from new moms.  Each of his books concentrate on the two most stressful times in a new Mom's life with her child. I also highly recommend purchasing the DVD in which he demonstrates all the techniques in the books.

2049879,5,B0001ZJQ72,"You will watch this DVD (I strongly suggest you also read the book to get the next level of depth/detail), and think it's nuts and you can't do it.  You will say, ""Talking to my child like that won't work, it'll get him/her more upset, and people will stare at us and think we're crazy.""

Then you try it.

And it works.  And each time, it works faster and faster.  Then people start staring at you because of how quickly you stop a scene from being made.  Or they stare because your child is so good and there's some other child melting down with parents who can't do anything about it.

Toddlerese (and the other tools like the Fast Food method) is magic. Anytime our son gets upset or demanding, a little toddlerese changes the game - almost instantly. It works for any situation he's upset during - when he doesn't want to go down for a nap or wakes up upset during the night.  He's basically been free of the tantrums people think are a given for a 2 year old.  The only time we couldn't get them to work was during a flight when his ears were hurting too much during decent.  Otherwise, pure magic.

2049883,2,B0001ZJQ72,"My husband and I got the book first and decided to get the dvd to make sure we were doing the techniques right.  All I can say is, the toddlerese just fuels our little one's fire and makes the tantrums even worse than they were to start with.  We have what Dr. Karp calls a ""spirited"" toddler and these methods just plain didn't work.  I really wish they would - the only thing we can get to work so far with our 2 1/4 year old is to ignore the tantrum and let her calm down before trying to communicate any further with her.  Also, our daughter communicates with us much above the level that Dr. Karp indicates in his book - even when she is in a rage of tantrum, maybe that's why this doesn't work for her - who knows.  Best wishes to all those that do try this though.  I guess it must work for some people!

UPDATE:  We have found that the underlying methods in this do work with our toddler, but we had to modify how we used it.  For instance, our toddler doesn't appreciate the toddlerese, but the fast food method definitely works and with a little further guidance from Dr. Karp it has made some difference in our toddler's tantrums and behavior.  Definitely try different approaches with the ideas from this method in mind if you don't find it working.",1212364800,52,1261,4.282700421940929

I have read the book three times, and the book works well as a stand-alone reference; however, having the video alongside would have made the book much more valuable and understandable. Karp's demonstrations of toddlerese are laughter-inducing to us adults but provide the clearest example of what he sets forth in his book. Unfortunately, it seems that the majority of parents who read the book or watch this video can't move beyond the ""embarrassing"" toddlerese. Dr. Karp addresses this in the video by asking the parents bluntly if they would rather do something that works or care more about what others think in public. Too bad the video doesn't emphasize that more often!

I actually would have liked the video to be longer and to feature longer toddler meltdown sessions with Dr. Karp at the helm. The way the current video is edited only partially satisfies. The Q&A section of the video is a bit redundant in places, but it does a good job at *quickly answering* the most obvious questions that parents would have about implementing Karp's method.

This DVD made that unncessary as we were given a five step plan for each time he was fretful. Each time, we did the 5 step plan and IT WORKED. I have since bought this for each of my pregnant friends as their baby shower gift. They see how i can settle my infant in under a minute and they are shocked. This alone is testament to the power of the instruction in this DVD. I also could not live without the calming sounds CD you can purchase as well.

So, imagine my surprise when I heard that part of the technique was using simple words and phrases, repetition and matching the emotions of the child.  Despite the positive praises in the DVD, I was still skeptical.

As I was watching the video, my husband was bringing my two year old toddler up the stairs to bed.  She was wailing and he was using his best firm voice.  I rushed in the room and used the technique.  This child stopped and looked at me like I was a crazy person.  She then ran over to me and gave me a hug.  I then told her that it was time to go to bed and asked her to help me take off her shoes.  Battle #1 over.

As is the norm in our house, the toddler gets in the crib and bounces, sings and calls out to us for 30 - 60 minutes EVERY Night.  So, I go into the room and using the technique (even though this is not a true tantrum).  After I ackn her desire not to go to sleep, I tell her that it is night-night time and ask for a hug before she goes to sleep.  She gives me a hug, grabs her blanket and places her head on the pillow.  I rushed to my computer to share the joy.  She's not even singing herself to sleep.

Despite the silly feeling of matching your child's emotions and simplified language, it really seems to work because the child realizes that you understand what they are feeling.  Geez, this is the same stuff they teach in all communication (interpersonal skills) classes.

Give it a try.  It's worth every penny.  Oh, I bought the video instead of the book, because I wanted to see the techniques in action.  I may pick up a used copy of the book to remind me of the techniques.  There are a few and since we have a couple of additional years to survive, it's nice to have an easy reference.",1180310400,4,1881,4.1353591160221

He also has great suggestions for stopping the tantrum before they start. That's why I say that it is worth reading but a difficult technique to apply. We don't do the toddler-ese because we never seemed to do it right so it did not work but we have applied other techniques and found them to be very helpful.",1180051200,2,550,4.455445544554456

I heard Dr. Karp speak at a conference and was very impressed by his research and theories, and even more by his workable strategies. This one however falls very short in my opinion. I would never suggest to my teachers or parents that they speak Toddlerese (in a very whiney voice to meet the toddler at his level). Although some of us may have done this in desperation and seen that it definitely gets a toddler's attention, I believe along with child development experts (not pediatricians who generally have no training in education or social development beyond what was touched upon in their physiology courses) that modeling the behaviors we want to see is the most respectful and effective way to shape a child's behavior. Matching a child's tantrum with one of your own seems shortsighted . I bet it works wonders in a ten minute office visit though. On the other hand, there are some insightful observations that Dr. Karp makes about toddler minds, but there are much better and more complete sources for this. And you are probably interested in this dvd for dealing with discipline and tantrums.

The CD much more to the point and very helpful in teaching more effective communication skills.

For a specific, concise compatible book with hundreds of additional quick read discipline suggestions for parents of toddlers and preschoolers, I also highly recommend THE POCKET PARENT by Gail Reichlin.

Just look up the annoying behavior at hand and come away with fast answers to such behaviors as Anger, Bad Words, Biting, Bedtime and Mealtime Refusals, Sibling Fights, Not Listening, Power Struggles, Manners, Tantrums, Separation Anxiety, Lying and Whining.

I read the book, ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block,"" first, which I recommend, to get the nitty-gritty on his methods and to understand the ""whys"" behind his methods. It takes awhile to get through the book and have it well absorbed, but it is certainly time well spent since it will save you from three or more years of headaches!

I was so impressed by the book that I decided to buy this DVD in order to see real-life examples of his methods. I was not disappointed. This DVD offers a great overview/review of the book, real-life examples with parents and toddlers, and thoroughly covers the main points (such as ""Toddler-ese"" and ""The Fast Food Rule"") as well as most of the side topics (such as ""Feeding the Meter"" and ""Gossiping""). Again, it is time and money well spent since it will help save you from headaches and public embarrassment! And more importantly, you will begin to form a foundation of open communication and mutual trust with your child as you learn to communicate love and respect to him - in his own language - instead of resorting to more violent or forceful forms of parenting. I only wish that Amazon.com would bundle ""The Happiest Toddler"" book with ""The Happiest Toddler"" DVD, instead of bundling Dr. Karp's two books together and his two DVDs together. I agree with the other reviewers that you really should read the book, too, to get the most out of what he is teaching here. But everything by Dr. Karp is wonderful, easy-to-understand, highly effective, and trustworthy. His methods are not gimmicky; he really understands kids and you'll understand yours better after learning this material. My daughter is about to turn one and I already connect with her better by using Toddler-ese!

2049906,3,B0001ZJQ72,"After reading the great book, I was curies to see Mr. Karp method in a real. But the film gives you only overviewed information about the method. You can hear Mr. Karp himself talking about the method and people from Mr. Karp classes talking about how the method works with their children, but you don't hear as much as you can read in the book. Except a few short moments you can't hear ""Toddler-ese"" and see real situation with cranky toddler. Some scenes and  bla, bla, bla....

This film is more like advertisement of the book, then information itself.",1094774400,22,556,4.606060606060606

8019260,1,B0001ZJQ72,"This follow up to Happiest Baby on the Block is disappointing. Only about 30 min long, this video gives some general advice and seems like it was slopped together so that Karo could make another product. I loved Happiest Baby and had high expectations, but this is inadequate.",1514678400,,276,4.770833333333333
8019261,5,B0001ZJQ72,"As a mother and an Infant/Toddler Educarer (""Teacher""), this is by far the best method for developing a person from the inside out. I have a huge library for the parents in my program. Very rarely do I recommend anything else.

I totally understand the parents who say that it makes the tantrums worse or don't have an impact. You have to take the lllllooooonnnnnggggg view here. The key to these little creatures is repetition and making them feel safe and understood. If you can stay calm, reflect back to them and let them fall apart when necessary, they will learn that being upset is ok and that, yeah, mom/dad really does get me. This will help you and your child develop a growth mindset which will be so crucial in the upcoming academic years. It will also build a trusting relationship between you and your child which will serve you well as your child starts trying to make sense of what they see and experience when they are away from you.",1510444800,,950,4.523255813953488

8019264,4,B0001ZJQ72,I really love the concepts behind this book and I was very excited to try it out but my efforts result in more tantrums. I am thinking maybe it works for some kids and not others? My daughter is very spirited. I am going to keep trying for a little while but so far no luck with the diffusing of tantrums.,1488931200,,305,4.016393442622951

8019268,2,B0001ZJQ72,"I wanted to like this.  I really did.  I think I've watched it 20 times.  It makes our toddlers mad when we use this method.  They seem confused why we are speaking like them and get even more frustrated.  Perhaps we are just not doing this method correctly or consistently enough, but I am definitely not good at ""Toddlerese"".....This was recommended to me by a friend, but it just did not work.  The video footage is pretty outdated and very repetitive.  You can get most of what's on this video from youtube.  I'm disappointed in this product.",1476748800,,546,4.556701030927835
