8509450,4,B0073UNUC0,"This dvd is great. I did it for 4 weeks and it helped tone my abs after my first pregnancy. And I am using it now the second time around,  along with a healthy diet. This is one of Gilad's best exercise dvds.",1440288000,,208,3.8372093023255816
8509451,5,B0073UNUC0,I am so glad I got Hard Core Abs.  I really like the idea that the circuits  are dived into four parts. It give a person an opportunity to go at their own pace. If you are strapped for time  you could do the warm up and maybe one or two circuits. I am waiting for my aerobic step to come than I will work on completing the full work out. Diffidently worth the money.,1428969600,2,366,3.8533333333333335

8509453,5,B0073UNUC0,This is a GREAT workout!  If you want to get into great shape I recommend all of the Lord of the Abs DVD's!,1377820800,,107,3.652173913043478
8509454,5,B0073UNUC0,"I am big fan of Gilad and this is one of my favouirite DVDs now. First time I couldn't even complete all excercises, it was tough. I am working out with DVDs for the past 5 years and this work out i consider as advanced level, though beginners can do it as well just by adjusting excercises as Gilad suggest through the programm.  This work out programm doesnt require any equipment (you can use step but its not really necessary). Basically its just few excercises joined in 4 sessions each one increasing degree of difficulty, so you can even stop at the end of any session and move to cool down part if you cant do whole programm. As you are getting stronger you can do the whole thing with advanced level of excercises.",1358294400,3,723,4.395522388059701
8509455,4,B0073UNUC0,"I enjoyed this workout.  It feels like I may be getting a better cardio workout than my abs, but it is still a great ab and body workout.",1347408000,2,137,3.892857142857143
8509456,4,B0073UNUC0,"Gilad's core workout is a mix of standing and floor work.  At over 1 hour, it is a long and intermediate workout which reminds me a little bit of his earliest shows.  The workout has four circuits or cycles which, in general, are variations of one another and is therefore, a little repetitive.

Gilad instructs and works out with three ladies and a gentleman.  A healthy and extremely fit young lady from the beach also joins the group.  A step is optional and you may need a mat.
