8098816,5,B00005V319,"Classic Sci-Fi fun and very British!
Packaging artwork states this release is Region 2, NOT SO!
It is in fact REGION FREE (?)* because it plays effortlessly in my Region 1 & A 4K UHD player which will not play most of my other region discs.

I like this series but Gerry Anderson's honest obsession with technology slows the pace a bit.
The technology used is very dated, as is the entire production. It looks and feels a lot like the Thunderbirds and the Stingray Marionation classic series, not a bad thing but UFO could have been more timeless, maybe like Space:1999?
I like the HOT go-go looking babes and the purple issue wigs!
A very distinctive touch.
The alien invaders are a bit lame, people in GREEN makeup?
Not very original or creative.

Video quality is very good and well restored, very bright and clear without dirt and scratches.
This is a DVD release and I am watching them with a 4K UHD player & 4K TV.
They upscale really well, they look about like a Blu-ray.
I've noticed some old TV series and films look a bit better on DVD, upscaled Blu-rays and native 4K discs can be annoyingly grainy.

A very fun series and important entry in the history of Gerry & Sylvia Anderson productions.

* Please note I am using a Philips BDP5502 4K Bluray player which will play SOME other Region discs but NOT ALL.
Your results may vary, I know from experience these discs will NOT play in a Philips BDP7501.
