4167900,3,B003QF1N9S,"I bought this title without renting or anything & I liked it. No its not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but if you're into cult and camp like I am you might enjoy this film. It was entertaining at the very least.
In a nutshell, an unpopular kid (nerd)at school takes a potion he made in chemistry class to kill people he doesn't like or make his life difficult. He turns into a violent 'beast'
Sort of like a I was a Teenage Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde. The monster make up isn't all that much but the gore & violence more than make up for the shortcomings. Again not great but still fun. The killings are brutal as well..
The Code Red DVD to me looks really good. If they did use film elements for an HD Transfer my guess is those elements may not have been in great shape. This was on par with Slithis in terms of print quality. I cant imagine the transfer looking any sharper than it is now. This was shot on 16MM so that is why you will some specs and grain - but clear nonetheless..
What I would suggest is read all the reviews of this film and go by what your tastes are for cult/horror/camp before making a purchase decision.",1282780800,5,1137,4.126126126126126
4167901,3,B003QF1N9S,"Forced to drink one of his one of his own laboratory concoctions by one of his tormentors, Vernon Potts has been transformed into a modern day Jekyll & Hyde. Vernon has been pushed around and abused by almost everyone around him his entire life and he's definitely done taking crap. Now Vernon's tormentors are about to learn a valuable lesson at school, don't mess with a mad chemistry student.

Welcome to ""Horror High"" AKA ""The Twisted Brain"" In the halls and classrooms of a small high school somewhere in Texas, a hideous form of evil is about to be unleashed. I don't think of ""Horror High"" as a horror film. In my opinion it's more of a revenge film where the main character sets out to even the score against all the people who have abused him; including teachers, class bullies, even the twisted school janitor is on his hit list. After bodies start turning up in grisly fashion around the school, a local cop named Lieutenant Bozeman is brought in to catch the killer. Will the body count continue to rise? Will Lt. Bozeman be able to stop the killer in time or will he be the next victim?  You'll have to buy your own copy to find out.

Horror High has built up a huge following with fans since it was released in 1974 and thanks to Code Red it has finally been treated to a proper DVD release or has it? Code Red states that the new video transfer is mastered in HiDef from the original Crown International negatives. While the new HiDef video transfer is clear, it still suffers from speckling, scratches, lines and debris; too much for my liking. As a fan of this movie I was really disappointed with the picture quality for the amount I paid for the DVD. I guess the original film negatives could only be cleaned up so much and this is the best ""Horror High"" will ever look on DVD. The second best part of the ""Horror High"" DVD was the On-camera interview with Austin Stoker. The disc packaging and disc artwork from Code Red is well done.

For any fan of ""Horror High"" looking to purchase this movie, I recommend that you rent this version first to see what you're getting in terms of picture quality.

4167902,5,B003QF1N9S,"""Horror High"" is a Jekyll/Hyde type movie that was made in the early 70's.  Vernon is a nerdy character who is obsessed with his high school chemical lab project.  Vernon also has a problem with several characters who makes his life miserable.  Miss Grindstaff flunks him on a term paper or book report where he accidentally turned in the wrong paper and tried to make things right by handing in the correct paper that he had mixed up.  She didn't care and cut up his paper and flunked him.  The janitor threatens and berates Vernon for shooing his cat away from the lab room with a broomstick.  Vernon was just trying to protect Mr. Mumps, his lab guinea pig.  You know how cats are around rodents.  Roger the school jock, threatens Vernon to stay away from his woman.  Roger and his buddies torments Vernon in the gym locker room and they tear up his lab handbook. Finally, the p.e. coach threatens Vernon to help Roger pass his Chemistry test or else he will make his life miserable.
  Miss Grindstaff and Roger destroyed Vernon's lifelong lab work.  The janitor and the cat are a physical threat to Vernon and Mr. Mumps. The coach is corrupt.  This pushes Vernon over the edge and he confronts his tormentors one by one.
I was rooting for Vernon and I enjoyed what happened to each of the victims.  Not to forget, Vernon has a love interest, but she's going out with Roger.  Lieutenant Bozeman is investigating the murder of every victim and he's very suspicious of Vernon.
  I don't expect people to think of this movie as scary or even gory.  You are not going to see any amazing special effects of Vernon transformation into a Mr Hyde type character.  There's no nudity and it's rated R for the violent content.
  I'm giving this movie 5 stars because I enjoyed this revenge movie from start to finsih.  The pace of the movie moves along at a nice speed.  It's not one of those type where it takes forever for something to happen.  There's a motive for Vernon's murder spree whether you agree with him or not.  The setting and timeline as well as the budget worked very well for the film.  You don't need millions of dollars to make a spectacular movie.  I liked the good characters and the bad characters because they're people you have dealt with in your lifetime.  Lieutenant Bozeman is a very good character like the television detective Columbo.  He's not similar to Columbo.  For some reason I felt like the character was inspired by 70's television detective shows.  I wish they could have done a spin-off movie or television series for Lt Bozeman.  They could have made him into a horror type detective.  I liked Lieutenant Bozeman's method of questioning a suspect.  It's a style where he's convinced you're guilty and you will fall into his trap.  My favorite part of the movie is when Vernon finally meets the coach in the gym.  The cleat shoe stomp would not feel too good.
  I recommend ""Horror High"" for anyone interested in a unique take on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the unlucky victim taking revenge and 70's style horror movies or even the original ""Prom Night"" with Jamie Lee Curtis.  I was very satisfied with Cod Red's version of the movie and I'm very glad they released it since I've never seen this movie before.  By the way, ""Return To Horror High"" is not a sequel to ""Horror High.""",1281744000,5,3312,4.566326530612245
4167903,3,B003QF1N9S,"Horror High (1974) is silly, bloody, gory, and fake. In a bad way. A Bad movie. Just plain bad. Nothing to see here, but don't move along.

The direction is excitingly pitiable, the acting is indifferent, the effects are marked by a lack of interest, and I can easily go on about all the inadequate elements of this mess. No aspect of this thing comes close to being favorable.

But, this 70's exploitation film shines out as the type of bad entertainment people loved back then.

4167933,4,B003QF1N9S,"I want to review this movie based on content and the various creative aspects rather than on it's technical merit.  To get the technical details taken care of, I have to say the cameral work is very shaky and jerky at times, lighting is lacking sorely in spots thus giving the viewer a lot of black screen to watch and the audio is pretty rough at several times in the movie. So there's the technical stuff...now for the good stuff.  The acting is pretty good, the storyline is familiar enough to most to be easy to follow, the continuity is pretty much spot-on, and the dialogue is believable.  You find yourself rooting for Vernon since those who get taken down are the kinds of characters you just wish someone would get rid of.  The plot moves along quickly and doesn't drag and the ending is swift and to the point.  I was really surprised at just how much I ended up liking this movie especially considering it was made the year I was born.  I know there is a technically more superior version of this available but I'm not sure how to find it.  This is the 'terror' version remastered in 1983.  I really liked it and it is the kind of movie that can stand the test of time since even with how much time has passed since it was made, the only glaring differences between modern times and this setting are cosmetic as in hair and clothing.  Good movie and worth the watch.",1423094400,2,1377,4.368627450980392
4167944,4,B003QF1N9S,"HORROR HIGH (aka: TWISTED BRAIN) is about ultra-nerdy high school student Vernon Potts. Vernon spends much of his time in the biology lab, working on his secret formula. That is when he's not being tormented mercilessly by the school's jock population. One night, Vernon discovers that his formula has worked. It turns a gentle guinea pig into a ferocious, roaring beast that kills the janitor's cat! The janitor goes bananas, beating Vernon half to death, then forcing the poor lad to drink the rest of the formula. As expected, the formula's effects kick in, turning Vernon into a murderous monster. Bye-bye janitor! Let's just say that the 55 gallon drum of sulfuric acid (!!) in the biology lab comes in real handy! All of Vernon's mean teachers and classmates had better beware! In no time Vernon's enemies are turning up dead in horrible ways. HORROR HIGH is a nerd revenge fantasy / horror film from 1974. It's also a lot of fun to watch.

Spoilers deserve to die!

This episodic cinema delight starts off with a trip down the memory lane of one Vernon Potts (Pat Cardi of Gunsmoke, Rawhide, Branded and It's About Time) who is keen to finish his experiments on Mr. Mumps, his guinea pig that will prove that drugs can alter you physically as well as mentally.  Yeah thanks Vernon, we are all painfully aware of steroid abuse. Vernon is basically the town's punching bag.  Jocks loathe him, teachers seem to think less of him and the creepy janitor Mr. Griggs (Jeff Alexander of Curse of the Swamp Creature, Scarlet Diva and Zontar: The Thing from Venus) even threatened his life if he touched his cat or spying on his lemon drink.  Desperate to prove his formula, Vernon sneaks back into the Bio chem lab to complete his experiment.  Finding shocking results that night while preparing Mr. Mumps' dinner, Vernon finds Mr. Griggs' cat dead and mutilated as Mr. Mumps snuffed him.  The formula drives living beings to their most barbaric state; much in the same way as High School or having to see Rent.  Mr. Griggs takes offense to his kitty being ripped apart, savages Mr. Mumps with a lead pipe and gives Vernon a chance that he either drinks his own formula or gets his throat ripped out with broken glass.  Well following those tough after school special moments Vernon downs his drink, feels like he drank the water in Mexico, devolves and pummels Mr. Griggs.

Next day Mr. Griggs and kitty is found in the convenient vat of sulfuric acid dissolving away.  Enter Lieutenant Bozeman (Austin Stoker of Assault on Precinct 13, Battle for the Planet of the Apes, `Sheba, Baby' and Roots) and this cat is on the case.  Is it an accident?  A possible homicide or was it just an ignorant redneck cashing in his chips?  Bozeman is determined to find out.
 Writer/director Larry N Stouffer (Sands of Ecstasy and Horror High) brings us his 1974 rated PG tale of terror had more one takes in it than this film that could pull it off.  Now bear in mind my copy seemed almost pirated off a cheesier VHS copy, the sound of course is just barely above stereo, no extras, the film was cut and jumped around a fight scene was completely lost on me and frankly had more lines ran through this copy than a VHS of Evil Dead or Reservoir Dogs.  Half of the time the actors are not miked, the sound effects and suspense ratcheting music is irritating to the equilibrium and the night shots aren't lit at all.  I am not one to trash a cheesy film for a few technicalities but dammit they were kinda piling up.

This thrilling opus would...oh who the hell am I kidding...this stinkburger will give you gas and keep you up all night.  In spite of Vernon's lack of a spine and social inadequacies, the kid was rocking that Shaun Cassidy do but who could say what future awaits the spineless little milksop.  Bottom line:  There is table tennis, mini-golf and lighting your farts on fire for better entertainment.",1346284800,2,3215,4.576923076923077
4167950,4,B003QF1N9S,"Originally called ""Twisted Brain,"" ""Horror High"" is a classic revenge film, using the ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" premise to tell the story of a brilliant young chemistry student who, as one would guess, is bullied by the other students and is victimized by a few of his teachers as well.

On the surface, Vernon Potts is a nice kid; friendly, polite, articulate, and well-mannered. But, there is something vicious brewing just beneath the surface. There is a rage that has been dormant for some time, one he has kept in check, until one of his tormentors (the school's janitor; weird, nasty guy) does something particularly nasty to him, only to have it fly back in his face (literally - if you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean). This sets into motion a chain of events which has horrible consequences, but still, the viewer sees Vernon's victims as deserving their fates. And to clarify what he does, a short flash-back is shown of the final straw in each case where the person has sealed their fate: force him to drink an unknown possibly deadly concoction? Be immersed in a known hazardous chemical. Shred his chemistry report, which he had worked for many weeks on? That same piece of equipment will be used on you. Torture him in the gym? That's what you get, with generous interest.

There are a few low-grade points in this film, but it is nonetheless very well executed. Watching the original opening credits in the ""features"" menu, when it was shown under the title ""Twisted Brain,"" one sees the abyssmal quality of the original footage, and by comparison, the production company has done a great job in cleaning up the picture and sound. It  still looks old and low-budget, but it somehow looks good despite all this.

It's a shlocky, grotesque story about revenge and tragedy, but as with all films of this type, there is a lesson: NEVER mess with someone who is smarter than you, because in the end, you WILL lose.

Bottom line: A good bag of popcorn movie.",1296259200,3,1977,4.669540229885057

4167952,4,B003QF1N9S,"Horror High is like Carrie, only with a teenage boy getting revenge on his tormentors instead of a teenage girl. It came out two years before Carrie, though, so it can't be called a copycat. Also Vernon, the bullied high schooler in this film, doesn't have telekinetic powers. He is just a nerd who creates an experiment that turns him into a vicious killing machine. Like Carrie, there are times when Horror High is hard to watch and a little depressing, if you can relate to being picked on anyway. I didn't like the scenes with the jocks making fun of Vernon. Even though it was necessary for the film, I wanted to reach into the TV screen and punch the bullies myself. The score in Horror High is pretty creepy, and the song that plays during the opening credits and closing credits is haunting and beautiful. There isn't a high body count in this vintage slasher flick, but the deaths included are good. I especially liked the janitor's death. It's not perfect, but Horror High is a cool, yet goofy, horror film.",1294963200,4,1017,4.562841530054645
4167953,4,B003QF1N9S,"The Code Red release of ""Horror High"" is way better than the ""Twisted Brain"" version that was put out on dvd by Rhino Home Video a few years back.  The new version looks sharper and sounds better.  Most important though is the fact that this is the uncut PG release.  Contrary to the rumors ( including what's written on the back of the box ) there is no R rated version of this movie.  When the movie was originally released in 1974 and even during it's re-release in the early 80's,  it was the same version that is presented here.  And it was rated PG.  Yes it's violent enough to have an R rating,  but it was given a PG when it was originally released.  In fact I couldn't find a rating code for this movie,  so it's quite possible that the PG rating on the poster was made up, and Crown International just went ahead and booked the film into theaters without a true rating from the MPAA.  I love this movie and the only reason I didn't give this new dvd 5 stars is because the picture quality isn't as good as it could have been.  The color is very washed out, and in some scenes the picture almost looks animated.  This very well might be the best version that Crown International had in there vault,  but the master negative ( if ever found ) will look much better.  Austin Stoker's suit is actually blue,  but you would never know that from this washed out print. Also,  picture is missing from the top and bottom of the screen due to the fact that the movie is presented in a widescreen version.  This movie was not shot in a 1:85.1 ratio, and there should have been a full screen version option available,  for those who want to see the actuall bell that Mrs. Grindstaff picks up and rings in order to hush her noisy students.
