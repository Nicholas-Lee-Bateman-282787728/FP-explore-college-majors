She was the first American Sweetheart and her work will always be treasured. Also must mention the colorization by Legend Films was perfect. I can only have 100% praise for this DVD--highly recommended!!!",1395619200,,341,4.896551724137931
8284452,4,B001BSBBTE,"This second installment in Legend Film's Shirley Temple: The Early Years series features two more rare Temple shorts, which will no doubt be relished by her fans.

""Our Girl Shirley"" and ""Merrily Yours"" both come from the 'Frolics of Youth' series (which operates like an early precursor to the Andy Hardy franchise) produced by International Pictures roughly between 1933-34).  The 'Frolics of Youth' shorts featured Shirley--on the cusp of Fox stardom--as a precocious little girl named Mary Lou, whose always getting her older brother Sonny (Junior Coghlan) in and out of scrapes.  The print for ""Our Girl Shirley"" comes from an Astor Pictures reissue source and features an extended introduction which highlights Temple's various screen successes since her participation in the 'Frolics of Youth' series.

""The Biggest Little Star"" is a compilation of Fox Movietone newsreel footage, showcasing Shirley at the premiere of ""Wee Willie Winkie"", accepting her Academy Award, visiting Eleanor Roosevelt and driving around the Fox backlot in her miniature car.

There's still some room for Legend Films to add another volume to their ""Shirley Temple: The Early Years"" collection; including two additional titles from the 'Frolics of Youth' series (""Dora's Dunking Doughnuts"" and ""Pardon My Pups"").  Let's hope a third disc isn't too far away.",1247097600,,1341,5.423076923076923
8284453,5,B001BSBBTE,"In this second part to the Shirley Temple Early Years collection, Legend Films has continued their work of restoring and colorizing some of the actress' rarer moments for future generations to enjoy.  This disc contains two family-friendly short films (much longer than the shorts presented on the first disc, so have no fears about the amount of content) and a special feature retrospective of Shirley's young career, done in the nostalgic style of a movie newsreel (don't you miss these?).  Anyone familiar with Legend Films' colorization efforts knows them to be top-notch, and this DVD is no exception.  Anyone interested in good, old-fashioned fun would be well served to pick up this collection.",1228176000,,701,5.185840707964601
