6619022,5,B00N9XKS2U,"Even though this was a bit hefty on price.... I'm very glad to own it.  This truly is the only sports programming I can get my fiancee to watch and she actually has enjoyed every program I've shown her and is interested in seeing more.  I started her off with ""The Book of Manning""  which is just a great story of an amazing man and family.  One of the things I love about this series is the fact they touch on sports I love that aren't just the big ones... we get films on Track and Field athletes, Tennis, Little league baseball,soccer, and bike racing....  and the films usually find a unique way of entering the worlds they cover.  We don't get the typical career history of Wayne Gretzky , we get the turmoil of his trade to the Kings,  We get Jimmy Connors US Open swan song instead of the big early years stuff, the only American to ever win the Tour De France , Greg Lemond and his amazing story and back stabbing by the French superstar.  Sadly, some brand new films like the interesting story of Brian Bosworth are not included , which means this very expensive and expansive set is out of date the date it was released.... but that is my only gripe.  I'm a very happy owner and these are films I don't mind watching over and over. Almost all the films have bonus footage as well.",1419724800,37,1290,4.275720164609053

6619028,5,B00N9XKS2U,"I'm no film critic, but what I can say is that these are excellent stories.  They're sports-based, so any sports fan will love them, but they're much more than just sports stories.  They're about tragedy and suffering and victory and loss and redemption, among other things.  Because of that even people who aren't sports fans will enjoy them.",1474070400,,343,4.879310344827586

6619035,3,B00N9XKS2U,"Very Misleading!!!! Not a true 5 Year Anniversary set. And not very accurate in describing what you are getting here!
You will get films released through July 2014.
Here is what you will get in this set:
5th Anni Films 1-30 - Season/Series 1-30 for 30 - Films 1 - 30
5th Anni Films 31-41, 56, 62, 80 - in between Season 1 and Season 2 and sprinkled throughout are 14 other ESPN films produced mostly in 2011 but before July 2014
5th Anni Films 42-55, 57-61 - Season 2-30 for 30 - Films 31 - 49. If you check IMDB, this is up to the film ""Slaying the Badger"".
5th Anni Films 63-70 - here 8, 30 for 30 Soccer films.
5th Anni Films 71-79 - the 9, 9 for IX films
5th Anni Films 81-100 - 20 assorted 30 for 30 Shorts and 9 for IX Shorts.

And the films are not necessarily in the order they were aired.

I'd have to due a bit more research but it does not appear that set does include everything up to July 2014. And considering the 1st episode aired in Oct 2009, that makes the 5 year Anniversary claim a little dubious.

One of the films, Films 80, ""Abby: Head On"" about Abby Wambaugh doesn't even have any film credits in the included film guide. Really?!? It's an ESPN film and you don't know who wrote, directed or produced the film.
At the very least, this listing of what's included should be in the description of what is included in this set.
And it should, at the very least, have included the complete second season of 30 for 30.

So since ESPN only released a complete Second Series Set, I'll be duplicating films 31-45 when I have to buy it to get the second half of the series.

And the XL t-shirt, knit cap and poster do little to make up for the disappointment.
The locker went into the recycling bin.",1458172800,17,1712,4.16012084592145

6619060,5,B00N9XKS2U,This set is awesome! Way more than just 30 sports doccumentries that I thought I was getting.

Sure many of these have been seen on ESPN and one can even access some on streaming services, but the packaging here is also a selling point.  There are many stories here, that I do not know much about and am looking forward to seeing.

6619066,5,B00N9XKS2U,"Simply amazing series.  I bought this because I teach at a small alternative high school & have a Team Sports class full of kids who'd rather do almost anything but PE and so we watch an episode once a week or so.  We're running about 80% super positive on all the episodes so far -- and trust me with these kids, that's amazing.  Some GREAT social issues come out from some episodes.  **CAUTION, there is some language issues with a few episodes but nothing the kids haven't heard a million times.

6619071,4,B00N9XKS2U,"The fact that I got this collection when it was offered as the Deal of the Day makes this more than worth the price I paid. I will point out that there are a couple individual films(1 each on 2 discs) that will not play. The films included on the same disc play just as perfectly as intended. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the unplayable films.

One in particular that really stood out was from Disc 20 which contains the ESPN shorts - it's called ""Irrelevant Giant"".  Former NY Giants coach, Bill Parcells, tells the story of John Tuggle - the last pick in the '83 draft.  He beat the odds by not only making the team but becoming a key member.  The following season he is diagnosed with cancer and the story continues from there.  That particular ""short"" is only 11 minutes, but it is as powerful as any full-length documentary.

8676720,5,B00N9XKS2U,"Anyone who follows sports during the 80's and 90's, and is generally a fan of all sports will enjoy this set.  The stories behind the stars, the game, the leagues the life style.  Especially for those who wagered on games, you will finally get the real dope you needed to place that bet back then.  Holy sh! t, I really enjoyed the story of the Big East and Roberto Duran.  I cried and cried with the Jim Valvano NC State story, was angry at the death of the USFL, amazed with the myth of Bo Jackson and inspired with University of Miami football.  You will not be disappointed.",1485388800,,578,4.314814814814815
