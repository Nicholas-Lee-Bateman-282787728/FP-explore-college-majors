1131898,3,788572560X,"DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST, (1951).  This black and white, classic 115 minute French film was adapted by acclaimed French director Robert Bresson, (LES DAMES DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE),from a well-known French novel by Georges Bernanos.  It concerns the priest of the small French village of Ambricourt, in the vicinity of Lille .It appears to take place at an earlier time, perhaps in the 1930s, before the outbreak of World War II.  The title priest, played by non-actor Claude Laydu, is a reserved and dedicated young man, new to the job, whose inability to mesh in social situations causes him to feel isolated from the very population he's supposed to be serving. His health problems add to his troubles, making him unable to carry out some of his obligations. As he grows sicker and ever more confused as to what his life really means, the priest feels himself further distanced from his village and from God.  This cerebral  film, Bressons fourth, done in the minimalist style that Bresson was to make his own, largely with amateur actors,  is often considered Bressons first masterpiece: he both wrote the screenplay and directed. The DVD also features commentary  by film historian Peter Cowie.

This film is powerful, but very, very slow.  It requires close attention to detail in order to understand it.  And it strongly reminds me of the Austrian Michael Haneke s WHITE RIBBON, made more than 60 years later.  Or, more logically, WHITE RIBBON is a reminder of this earlier French film.  Both tell the story of sensitive souls crushed  by the hostile, malicious inhabitants of a small isolated village.  However, in Hanekes film, we are given no explanation for the malice of the village, and particularly its children; just the thought that growing up in a village like that was enough to create Nazis.  Or perhaps it was just growing up speaking German.  At any rate, in DIARY, we are given an explanation; I expect from the novel upon which it is based.  Several characters remark that locals in that vicinity are all hobbled by having been born descended from generations of drunks; and that, furthermore, they were also probably malnourished as children. Mind you, we had particular difficulty in this house in benefiting from this film, as, unfortunately, we were not able to turn off the intrusive commentary by Cowie.  Ultimately, the only thing we could think to do was to set the TV controls to mute, thereby missing out on the atmosphere of the spoken French, and just reading the English subtitles.

Both  Bresson, and Bernanos were devoted Catholics.  In fact, the movies most famous line, ""All is grace, according to the Internet Movie Database, is a quotation from Therese de Lisieux, a saint to whom novelist Georges Bernanos was deeply devoted.  Regretfully, I doubt this film would appeal to a wide, general audience, or to anyone lacking a particular interest in it: an interest in French history, or Bresson,  or French film, or religious and spiritual dramas, or faith and spirituality.  If you have any doubts, Id recommend just streaming it prior to any purchase.",1394582400,2,3090,4.920849420849421

1131902,5,788572560X,"A young Priest goes to a French rural village and is disliked by the villagers. He has an unknown stomach ailment and is weak and ailing,living on a diet of bread, soaked in sugar and wine. Being austere and idealistic he wants to save souls. People want things for nothing,like a rich farmer,old Fabregars, who wants a cheap no-cost funeral for his wife. The aristocratic family draw him in to their web of problems,the wife,the mistress,the daughter. He is told by a priestly mentor to change his eating habits. He is often faint and morose. He needs to toughen up and not expect to be loved but give spiritual discipline. He has the masochistic misery of martyrdom.

He identifies with Christ at Golgotha. Bresson shows the priest as isolated and lonely,in need of love, and approval. He highlights this aspect, by showing him behind glass,seen through window frames. It may be raining or snowing outside but he is trapped in his cell,imprisoned in his own mind. He is drawn to similarly lonely people: the Countess,Seraphita,Chantal and Dr. Delbende. The Journal and the voiceover are Bresson's primary means to detail the Priest of Ambricourt's inner life. The very real writing of pen on paper, is a repetitive ritual throughout the film, blotting, scratching, closing: capturing the soul's immaterial thoughts,ideas and emotions. Similarly the raking of the ground outside mirrors the lining of his stomach. He is a psychological misfit.

He is mocked and tormented by his favoured student,Seraphita,at catechism classes. The Count dislikes him interfering with his family. He tells the Count his barn is empty and field is barren, and could be put to more productive uses for the villagers. He has been asked by the Governess, Louise,to intercede in a conflict involving her pupil,Chantal,the Count's daughter. Chantal tests the priest's compassion, by threatening suicide,she is manipulative, and pours scorn on the priest. In the film's most central scene, he is drawn into ministering to the Countess, imparting his suspicions about Chantal. He admits he fears death, but says he fears her death more. She is tormented and grieves for the loss of her son. He succeeds in helping her find inner peace. He admits the miracle of being able to give what he doesn't have himself. Chantal,unable to comprehend the change in her mother, misinterprets his actions as cruel,and begins to denounce the idealistic priest.

Bresson's film shows a visual metaphor of the spiritual life through his physical malady and the journal entries, the use of long and short shots,the harsh reality of the existence of a man of faith in a secular world. He is slowly consumed by stomach cancer as we learn later. The emotional power builds up through use of minimal dialogue and camera- in- face shots-the man's final moments distilled and captured in a single shot. The final image of an isolated cross encapsulates the profound suffering of this nameless priest. His last words:""What does it matter?All is grace"".The priest is free at last.

1131903,3,788572560X,"*** This review contains spoilers ***

Throughout the years, the 'passion story' of Jesus has always remained the bedrock of the Catholic church. Although respected, the story of the suffering of a man who lived 2,000 years ago no longer has the same impact it once did in earlier times. In our own time, the average 'believer' looks to the narratives of film for spiritual enlightenment. That's why the Catholic church of today has placed great importance on creating a list of great movies that reflect their values. 'Diary of a Country List' however is not on the Vatican Top 45. That's because director Robert Bresson's modern day Jesus figure, the Priest of Ambricourt, becomes a martyr after being rejected by the Church establishment.

Diary of a Country Priest is based on a novel written by George Bernanos in the early 30s. The film was made in 1950 but the pre-World War II setting is retained from the novel. The Priest (who is never named in the film) is an intense young man played by Claude Laydu (in his first film role). The Priest doesn't fit in at all in the village of Ambricourt. He actually suffers from what appears to be colitis (later diagnosed as stomach cancer) and subsists mainly on bread and wine. The rumor starts going around in the Village that he's an alcoholic. The village children don't understand his sophisticated catechisms except for one--Seraphita--who initially impresses the Priest with her knowledge of church doctrine. But when he asks her why she takes her studies so seriously, Seraphita mocks him by answering that he has beautiful eyes. Her schoolmates have all been listening to their conversation at the door to the rectory and burst out laughing at her retort.

The Priest obviously isn't very happy by the town's indifferent bordering on hostile reaction to his ministry but he trudges on. His mentor, the Priest of Torcy, is a much more outgoing and practical man who advises him to take control by establishing some kind of 'order' in dealing with his parishioners. Unfortunately, that's just not the Young Priest's style. He's much more blunt and often says exactly what's on his mind. The Priest's faith is tested early on when a physician he consulted for his stomach troubles ends up committing suicide.

The core of the narrative involves the Priest's relationship with a local Count and Countess who live on a nearby estate. The Priest hopes to convince the Count to donate money and some unused land for a youth center; the Count at first is receptive and promises to consider the Priest's proposal. Unfortunately, the Priest cannot ignore the fact that the Count is having an affair with the governess at the estate. To make matters worse, the Count's daughter, Chantal, is extremely angry with her father over his affair with the governess and threatens to run away (or even worse, commit suicide). The Priest dissuades the young girl from taking any rash action but refuses to be tactful with the Count, pointing out to him that his daughter is extremely troubled. The Count pegs the Priest as a meddler and makes it clear that his comments aren't welcome.

Even worse is the Priest's counseling sessions with the Countess who has been grieving for years over the death of her young son. At first the Countess makes it clear that she's lost all faith in God but the determined Priest manages to get her to look on the bright side once again. Ironically, the Countess drops dead hours after his last counseling session with her and the Count and the rest of the townspeople blame the Priest for 'exciting' the Countess and perhaps hastening (or even causing) her death. As a result, the priest is now 'persona non grata' in the town. He meets with the Priest of Torcy who patronizes him by insisting that his 'alcoholism' stems from (an early version of) fetal alcohol syndrome. He also advises the Priest not to meet with Chantal as he describes her as a 'demon' but the Priest insists he must minister to all--even those who are obviously lost.

In some respects, Bresson's updated passion tale echoes the original source material (i.e. The New Testament). Jesus's suffering is blamed on the Jews in the New Testament but here the Priest is cast off by cold and unfeeling townspeople supported by the punitive clergy. This appears to be the primary weakness of Bresson's story. Except for the mature Seraphita who comforts the Priest after he collapses due to abdominal pains and Chantal's cousin, the suave Olivier, who offers up a relaxing motorcycle ride as the Priest journeys to a neighboring town to obtain a consult with a physician, the bulk of the characters are all quite mean-spirited. It's the old stab-in-the-back mentality and Bresson is not immune to employing this device when serving up his newly minted Jesus figure.

There's more martyrdom in store for our hapless Priest. Sure enough, not only is he cast out by his parishioners but must endure the final crushing diagnosis: stomach cancer. The ordeal of fire is a modern one--instead of crucifixion on a cross, the Priest endures the modern 'crucifixion' of dying an agonizing death from cancer. The final image is one of the cross and like Jesus, the Priest maintains his faith despite all the suffering.

Bresson curiously has been described as an 'agnostic' but I think that's a misnomer. Rather, he accepts the Christian faith but views himself as outside the establishment. Diary of a Country Priest is worth watching a number of times, especially in terms of the gripping cinematography (reminiscent of films from the silent era) as well as the superb use of off-screen audio. Film scholar Peter Cowie's commentary is valuable as he compares the film to the novel. I disagree with his evaluation however, that the film is a masterpiece. The Diary has its thoughtful moments but in the end it's more propaganda than art.",1274054400,5,5863,4.867735470941883
1131904,5,788572560X,"Well worth a look, this well made movie is completely from the tormented viewpoint of the country priest via his journal.  I think it tells an important story, one worth serious contemplation.  But different people will get different things out if it.  Some may see it as inspiring, others as a cautionary tale.  I love the fact that it can be interpreted either way.  And perhaps in other ways as well, a real thought provoker.

By coincidence, I happened to view this not long after watching the movie of Kurt Hamsun's ""Hunger.""  A movie also from the viewpoint of a lonely and troubled individual.  The similarities are interesting, as are the differences.  Both are clueless about reality, dumbfounded by its lack of fit with their idealisms about it.  Other people are mostly sources of confusion to them.  The priest is motivated by service, and the writer (in Hunger) by mere survival.  Both are completely incompetent at it, unable to connect with the rest of humanity in any meaningful way (though the priest does seem to make a little connection with another priest, that's about the extent of it).  Whether their psychological states could be said to be anything but disfunctional, is undoubtedly a matter of interesting debate from either side.

My first impression is that the priest's torment, like the writer's in ""Hunger,"" was largely self-imposed, or at least, derived from his inability to recognize his own ignorance and do something useful about it.  Certainly, the townspeople were far less than model citizens, but this should not be all that surprising given the lack of solid priestly capabilities.  It seems to me that the young priest was not cut out for his job, wallowing in his sorrows which did himself no good and his parishoners a disservice.  His stomach problems seem a metaphor for the effects in the real world of his inability to understand much of anything.  He could not stomach the world, and the world had little stomach for him.  He does not offer what I would call a positive spiritual contribution, is a pain-in-the-gut for everyone else in one way or another, not just himself.  While he appears to have some empathy with others, I would say that it is merely imagined, as it seems only to arise in ways that are nonconstructive or inappropriate.  He seems to think he did well in his conversation with the countess, but it's not at all clear that the effect was actually a positive one.  It takes more than mere suffering to be a saint, one must also grow a backbone.  One must be able to effectively communicate.  Otherwise, say hello to self-indulgent masochism, blind fanaticism, or perhaps, just really lousy luck.  Like ""Hunger,"" ""Diary of a Country Priest,"" is akin to a train-wreck in slow motion.

I say my ""first impression,"" here, because I suspect I will have other thoughts about it upon additional reflection and additional viewings.  I think there is a lot here to contemplate.",1269734400,2,2937,4.8453815261044175
1131905,5,788572560X,"Diary of a County Priest is not a tale of a failed priest but rather a tale of a dying young priest who felt like a failure.  By the end of the movie (and the novel) it becomes apparent that he had a gift for touching people at a very deep level and in doing so leading them away from their self destructive habits and towards religious denouement.  His visit to a wealthy married woman locked in self-pity and anger against God for decades due to the death of her young son causes her to let go of all that bitterness and reconcile with God.  There were encounters equally revealing.  His humbleness enabled him to hold a mirror up to others; some hated what they saw in the mirror and others felt shame.  He wasn't derided by the town folk because he was ineffective but because he was effective, only he didn't know it.  Very early in the novel he comments to himself ""Grace is free but nobody seems to want it.""  He was aware that people were too caught up in their own selfish habits and bitterness and because of that they denied themselves the Grace which God makes available to those who call to Him.  This young priest of Ambricourt saw that Grace was all around and everywhere and that the real problem with so many people was that they refused to acknowledge that fact.  His simple beliefs were brought to light with his dying words spoken to a deracinated Catholic friend of his, ""Grace is everywhere"".  Diary of a Country Priest is worthwhile viewing for anybody interested in delving deeply into the intense Catholicity of pre-Vatican II Christendom.",1252281600,6,1564,4.5338078291814945
1131906,3,788572560X,"Robert Bresson's 1950 breakthrough film, Diary Of A Country Priest (Journal D'Un Cure De Campagne), is one of those films that is absolutely antithetical to everything a Hollywood film stands for. It is obsessive, detailed, slow, and opaque. This, however, does not mean it is a great film, as so many knee-jerk critics claim it is. It is not; but it is a very interesting film. Ostensibly, it may seem to be a film on religion and/or suffering, or, as film critic Frderic Bonnard claims, in The Criterion Collection's DVD essay on the film, a film `about imprisonment,' but it's neither, really. It's more cogently a film about masochism, guilt, and pathological privation, although it does touch upon religion, suffering, and imprisonment. The film was not only directed by Bresson (his fourth of thirteen films), but also adapted by Bresson from the 1936 novel of the same title by Georges Bernanos. Anyone familiar with the works of Carl Theodor Dreyer will be familiar with the techniques used by Bresson- although this film is less stagey and more intimate in tone, but Bresson's cinematographer, Lonce-Henry Burel, is not as slow and deliberate as Dreyer, nor does the film depend so heavily on the juxtaposition between light and dark as Dreyer's works do. There is a `lightness' in Bresson's film that is absent from Dreyer's- both in terms of the gauzey and diffused visuals and intellect. This is not to say that Bresson's film lacks depth, it's merely not as dependent upon a grand philosophical posit as Dreyer's films are.... Yet, the film never reaches the heights that other religiously meditative films, such as Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light, do, mostly because of the very blandness of the narrative. Whereas Bergman's film transcends religion and cores into universal human behavior, Diary Of A Country Priest merely presents its simple narrative, and if one cannot get into it- for its religious-specific ideas, so be it. Also, the film never gets truly inside the young priest. Why, for example, does he even keep a diary? All it seems to be is a book filled with gossip and his petty and self-serving observations. Yet, the film likens the priest to a Christ-like character, rather than a mere outcast. Since outcasts are universal, why does Bresson decide to affiliate the lead character with the remote Christ and not the ubiquitous nebbish? After all, the priest has no name, and this is clearly done to universalize him, even though a priest, by definition, is a non-universal figure. Not that a Christ complex could not be compelling onscreen, just that this particular one is not, for all this character can muster are vapid apothegms such as, `The desire to pray is already prayer,' ""I was a victim of the Holy Agony,' or his dying words, as related by Dufrty: `What does it matter? Everything is grace.'
  Were only those words true this film would recapitulate their meaning. Failing that, it at least tries, something that, again, Hollywood films do not even dare. Perhaps that young priest was on to something?",1221004800,2,3043,4.953033268101761
1131907,5,788572560X,"Bresson's adaptation of Bernanos' novel is one of the most perfect movies ever made.  Both Bresson and Bernanos are masters at understatement, and so a story that so easily could've become bloated with easy piety instead becomes a portrait of holiness.

The young cure of Ambricourt (Claude Laydu) finds himself in a parish where everyone mocks or despises him.  The local comte dislikes him because the cure knows he's having an affair with his daughter's tutor.  The school children mock him because he's youthful and inexperienced.  His fellow priests waffle between pity and scorn for what they see as his weakness.  And it doesn't help that the cure is plagued by ill health--he eventually dies of stomach cancer--and spiritual dryness.

Yet even in all his suffering and private and public humiliations, and despite his own self-doubts, he exudes a purity born of love that gives him a strength he isn't quite aware he possesses.  A perceptive canon tells him at one point that ""Your simplicity is like a flame that burns,"" and this is why, the canon concludes, the cure's parishioners so dislike him.  Sanctity is an affront to people whose lives are fractured by bad choices, carelessness, and a refusal to love.

The Cure of Ambricourt's spiritual journey reminds one of Teresa, the ""Little Flower,"" who famously defended the spiritual path of simplicity and smallness.  Sainthood isn't necessarily dramatic or flashy.  It can also be characterized, as the film's Priest of Torcy says, in ""doing little things, day by day, while [one] waits"" for God.

Cinematography, directing, and acting are superb.  Laydu's performance is as unforced and simple as it had to be to do justice to his character.  The robust but not unspiritual priest of Torcy, played by a psychiatrist(Adrien Borel) who had no previous acting experience, is touching. Nicole Ladmiral's portrayal of the troubled adolescent Chantal is heartbreaking.  Tragically, Ladmiral's promising career was cut short when she (apparently deliberately) threw herself under a Paris subway car in 1958.

1132017,4,788572560X,"As a country priest myself, I was interested in ""Diary of a Country Priest"" and I found much to like about the movie.  However, I was bothered by the title character's somber approach to his faith, his parishioners and just about everything else.  This was a man who seemed to have accepted a ""Calling"" about the same way others accepted being drafted during the Viet Nam War.  I realize that it fits the image of the stern, ""nobody better be having any fun"" sort of minister that seemed to have been common-place 3-4 generations ago.  However, I had a hard time figuring whether the priest was suffering from his stomach pain or his official duties.

There was a defining moment to this movie and I felt it was a pretty powerful extended scene.  The theology was relevant and on-the-mark.  The movie proceeded from that point in a sort of self-destructing manner and the ending was intentially anti-climatic (depending on your perspective of faith in general).

There was a lot that interested me during the movie and I even used some of it in the sermon the next day.  The relationship of priest to parishioner, the need for the priest to be there at the right moments and nowhere to be seen at the wrong moments, the loneliness of the job (for some),etc, were pretty well examined.  I couldn't help but be disappointed in how ""Diary of a Country Priest"" portrayed the priest and his job in such a dismal way.  When the priest said, ""God is love itself"", I wondered at how he could be so right yet seemingly uncomprehending of what he had just said.

Regarding this film, Bresson said that ""(...) I wasn't faithful to the style of Bernanos, and I omitted details which I disliked. But I was faithful to the spirit of the book and to what it inspired in me as I read it"".

This film recounts the spiritual journey of a new priest (played by Claude Laydu) that has to face unfriendly people in his first parish at the same time he suffers from ill health and doubts regarding his faith. The story is told mainly thanks to journal entries, something that allows the spectator to be privy to the priest's inner thoughts, and struggle with him when he faces different kinds of problems.

As you can probably imagine, it is not easy to watch this film. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it, as Bresson manages to capture the anguish and fierceness of the battle played in this young man's heart, and show us that interior drama in excruciating detail.

1132023,4,788572560X,"This film by Robert Bresson is beautiful and sad. Made in the same ambience and tone as his 'Au Hazard Bathasar' but not as exciting as it. I don't know where you are coming from, but if you are interested in intimistic and basically plotless cinema, as can be found in foreign (and old) movies, Bresson is a good choice. But if your reason is that of making a spiritual journey, or or widening your faith, then, you must be warned.

'Diary...' is pure doubt. The doubt of the main character, the rural priest, and the doubt of the director. The tone and the sadness of the experience of watchibng this film is what mostly impresses me. Other than that, what stays in my mind at the end of the story are the following thoughts:

a) The story-teller (Bresson) makes us reflect on the inutily of believing in God, or in acting as if God exists, for if He does exist, life in the present, my circumstance, reality, now, what I feel, the cancer I suffer, the the pain I feel, is so real, so more real than that God of Love I want to believe in but I doubt. This is the impression that this film is communicating me.

b) Everybody is cruel. This people don't even deserve my love for them. How can I love them. Why should I be different? It would be crazy. What would my argument be sustained on (the case of the young priest) in order to prove these people wrong in their believes and in their actions? God, his mercy and love? They look at me and they despise me! Or they pity me like a fool!

Sad. So this is not really a story, it is just a depiction of a tormented soul, of the realization that we are so imperfect, so weak (would Bresson even say ""sinful""?), a fool-on-the-moon's lament. A cry in the wasteland.

What do you do when you are hungry? Do you eat the food, or do you cry at it and blame it for being hungry? Same with God.

There is a certain resemblance between this film and the way the great historian Arnold Toynbee depicts disintegrating societies: There is a sense of drift, in which people yield to a meaningless determinism, as if their efforts do not matter, and as if they have no control over their lives. There is a sense of guilt, a self-loathing that comes from their moral abandon.

Drift and guilt. These nouns apply as well to the young priest's parishioners. The whole postmodern pandemonium.",1160092800,3,2324,4.353348729792148
1132024,4,788572560X,"Possibly the diary itself should have been excluded in this transition of the Georges Bernanos novel to film. The book allowed the diary passages, which by book's end swelled in emotional intensity, to serve as evidence to the sainthood of the young country priest who believes himself a failure at uplifting the spirit of his depressed parish. Here, the diary passages, although sometimes humanely profound, contol the film systematically as a tool to forward the plot, and never successfully reveal the character.

If you've never been moved by French author, Bernanos' powerful book, it's cinema counterpart may seem only dull and religious. If you have taken the book to heart however, there is a lot to admire here. The cold rural atmosphere can be felt like a chill to the bone in the bold, stark, black and white cinematography. The character actors surrounding the priest are a solid wall of antagonizing support. The young priest's joyous motorcycle ride is captured exactly as the book intended, as an unexpected escape from his mundane and painful life.

Claude Layduin, in the title role, is often moving as the sole god-fearing man in a village of depraved religious intention, but his wise, godlike stares away from the camera, as if into the mist, upset the ignorance and humility of the character, who never for a moment believes himself to be worthy of God, the essence of the novel.

The film appears to be slow moving, but we sense that just beneath the surface is a boiling cauldron of emotion. This disparity between the priest's almost otherworldly faith and the worldliness of his parishioners causes an uneasy feeling that we expect to be resolved by the story. But it's not. Instead, the priest's final action takes him beyond the conflict. It transcends it and we in the audience also taste that experience.

The heart of this film resides in the experience of transcendence. Viewers who expect to be drawn into a story will definitely be disappointed. This film demands more from us, but it rewards that effort with a profound experience that stays with us forever.",1126396800,5,906,4.915032679738562

It is almost an anti-film, with Bresson's austere, stripped-down style seeming to convey the director's lack of interest in the film medium. That is not to say that the film is shoddily made, it isn't. What I intend is that Bresson (a Catholic himself) is more interested in the 'deeply spiritual' (for want of a more precise phrase) meanings conveyable by the medium than in wanton demonstrations of directoral flair. I feel that the Amazon reviewer is correct in his assertion that ""Bresson charts the priest's collapse with a series of brief scenes, a minimalist style that makes the slightest touch of a hand or far-off sound of a dog barking seem magnified in importance."" Herein lies my (personal) problem with the film: I am not overly patient and, quite frankly, for me this film was a bit of a drag. That is not to say that I do not have the highest respect for it. It is unquestionably a great work of art; difficult, seemingly impenetrable, open to multiple interpretations. It is (as many have already stated) essential viewing for anyone interested in the rise of the ""New Wave"", or the history of film generally. The cinematography is frequently astounding, with a paired down lighting style that became popular in the 'cinema verite' genre over a decade later.

Bresson approaches the problem by filling the screen with Laydu's starved, haunting face at every opportunity. Plot, dialogue and acting take a back seat to the actor's troubled expressions, which Bresson shoots from a number of dramatic angles, especially the zoom-in close-up. While this does a lot to build atmosphere, it also left huge holes in my understanding of this troubled priest and his crisis. I found myself getting bored at yet another seemingly aimless scene where Laydu shivers or prays or writes in his journal. Bresson's technique is so effective that I felt I got the point--I had the essence of the character--after the first couple scenes. Still, the images of Laydu on a motorcycle and his midnight collapse in the country are unforgettable.
Bresson's ideas about film are sometimes said to be more interesting than the films themselves. I'm not sure that's fair, but it certainly helps to know something about his hopes for making film a language of its own, free from the conventions of the theater, in approaching this quiet & arresting work.",1046995200,17,1277,4.916666666666667
1132152,5,788572560X,"I have not yet seen Bresson's earliest film The Ladies of the Bois de Boulogne. That film was based on a Denis Diderot novel and that is not surprising as the Bresson films I have seen all have a distinctive literary quality. Diary Of A Country Priest as well as A Man Esaped(based on a memoir) & Pickpocket(based on a Dostoyevsky story) are all stories narrated to us by the protaganist. Diary of A Country Priest may be the most literary of them all for this film focuses almost exclusively on the thought processes of the priest. He tells his own story as though it were a confession. Bresson was a devout Roman Catholic but you don't have to be religious to appreciate this film because the priest struggles not so much with his faith but with his place in society. The film is quiet and is centered in this priests lonely introspections. He struggles not with faith but with making contact with another human being. Strangely enough his beliefs make him an outcast even to the other priests as they are much more practical minded and see the church as providing a practical social function. The other priests may believe in God but they live in the world comfortably. The young priest though is not practical and his religious feelings make him unable to function on any practical level. He has faith and yet he makes many of the villagers uncomfrotable because he is not a friendly gregarious presence as some of the other preists are but a quiet solemn one. He is really incapable of living on the surface of life and so he is incapable of the friendly kind of chatter that wins friends so when he goes on his rounds from home to home his social awkwardness tends to make people feel a bit uncomfortable. However when one woman has a true crisis of faith he is there for her in a way that one can see that it is this kind of situation he was made for. One of the more interesting and lighter aspects of the story is a friendship that develops between the priest and a young village girl. The girl is a rebel and tells lies and is drawn toward anything but the contemplative kind of life the priest lives and yet the two get along very well. The two  both feel isolated from others for different reasons but somehow they provide each other with an interesting kind of company.

 I think A Man Escaped & Pickpocket though both also quiet films are probably each more accessible than this one. A Man Escaped is about a resistance fighter who plans an elaborate escape from a Nazi prison, so though quiet and intorospective in its way we know there will eventually be a climax when he makes his attempted escape. Pickpocket is also very introspective but its a study of a criminal mind with plenty of exciting thefts and it ends with promise that the criminal has found something worth living for and so will change his ways.  Diary of A Country Priest is quiet all the way through. There is beauty in it but its an austere kind of beauty. This film compared to A Man Escaped & Pickpocket takes a lot more patience and has the least entertainment value but provides the deepest and richest experience. Its a one of a kind film for a very discerning kind of filmgoer. All of Bressons films are made with great care (he took 3-4 years to make each one) and this one any filmgoer will be able to see is the one he put the most care into.",1030147200,65,3337,4.421138211382114
7900317,5,788572560X,"What I like most about Diary of a Country Priest is it's raw, intimate, existential vein. The priest is always fully aware of himself and his mortality virtually throughout the film. He speaks to us directly via his diary and in voice overs. The entire film seems to offer us the sum and substance of life without any of the distractions, without any frippery. In a way it is the opposite of entertainment. It makes us look at the essence of existence and the story pulls no punches. Death is just around the corner in a largely friendless world. Most people are often mean and narrow-minded. Spiritual and physical pain comes in waves. The admirable protagonist soldiers on caring not about his poverty, his pullover full of holes, his drab abode. He is scoffed at, derided, unjustly criticised and humiliated by his ecclesiastical superiors and by his parishioners. He takes the lashings calmly sometimes even turning the other cheek but when necessary he firmly stands his ground.

True communication is also arduous and usually unsuccessful. People are locked in their egos, their personal view of things. However, the young priest does manage to persuade the ageing, embittered countess to put aside her spitefulness, reconcile herself to the premature death of her son and open up to reality and to those closest to her, like her neglected, scheming daughter, Chantal. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards, she has a heart attack and dies. The priest is blamed for having unduly agitated her and thus being the cause her death.

The films constant seriousness is also very welcome though there are some poignant moments of intentional or unintentional black humour.  For example,  when the rough hunter doctor examines the priest and tells him that they resemble each other.  When the puzzled priest asks him to explain the doctor replies: We  are the race that holds on, that faces up to it. A few days later he is found dead in the woods. The probable cause of death, suicide by means of a shotgun blast to the head. Not very comforting for the young curate if they really do resemble each other.

The glimpses we are provided of the lives of others through the accounts that people give to the priest are equally devoid of much joy or anything approaching satisfaction or success. The harsh barrenness rings true and is emphasised in the streets full of mud, grimy doors, leafless and crooked trees, restlessly barking dogs, creaking gates.  And yet at the very end after all he has gone through, after all he and we have seen, as he lays dying, he is amazingly able to say the remarkable and memorable phrase: All is grace. My own interpretation, is that this is an outstandingly generous expression of gratitude. An appreciation of the blessing of life, a thankfulness for the privilege of having lived, for the honour of having participated in the cosmic flow of life with all its harshness, however briefly.",1505692800,,2917,4.878787878787879

7900325,5,788572560X,"Robert Bresson's 1950 masterpiece Diary of a Country Priest (Journal d'un cur de campagne) is a film which has achieved legendary status largely due to many (Andrei Tarkovsky and Martin Scorsese among them) claiming it to be an important and inspiring contribution to the religious discourse of our time. It was Bresson's third feature and the one that defines the way his future films will be. Texturally, this is the first of two adaptations of the Catholic monarchist writer Georges Bernanos (the second will be Mouchette) and the first of three consecutive films which will be narrated in a first person voice-over. The narratives of A Man Escaped (1956), Pickpocket (1959) and this one are all the stories of one man's spiritual odyssey through doubt and failure to ultimate redemptive grace told as written (or as written later) so as to give us a profound look into the character's soul. Visually, the film announces the stark, spare austerity which will be a Bresson trademark from hereon in. The cinematographer Lonce-Henri Burel shot all the films from here through to The Trial of Joan of Arc (1962) and there is a certain uniformity of look though Bresson does temper his visual treatment according to his material - he always saw himself as a `cinematographer' rather than a `director' and each film was the start of a new investigation for him. Nevertheless, the grey mundane focus on `process' rather than `result' is omnipresent with seemingly bizarre framing and an eschewing of grand spectacle well to the fore. In relation to this, this film also announces the rejection of professionals in favor of amateur `models'. The only professional actor in the film is Rachel Brendt who plays the countess. Claude Laydu was the first model to announce the stunning success of Bresson's technique for though he is forced to look blank and expressionless throughout the film without any noticeable `acting' he still delivers an extraordinarily vulnerable performance which is seen by many as one of the very best in any motion picture.

In some ways Diary of a Country Priest is a transitional work throwing back as it does to the style of Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne (1945). Melodrama is not totally eschewed as the priest wanders around his parish and we are given confrontational scenes which work in the traditional manner along with an overt Brucknerian musical score from Jean-Jacques Grnenwald which is used consistently throughout. Music will gradually disappear from Bresson's films until the complete silence of L'Argent (1983). Au hasard Balthazar (1966) is the last film where music is omnipresent and the director later regretted he used Schubert there so much.

Put basically, Bresson's concern was always with the basic metaphysics underpinning the human condition - the reasons we live, the factors that propel human life from birth to death and beyond. As I have outlined in my other Bresson reviews his aesthetic is informed by Catholicism, in his case the peculiar French strain of predestinarian Jansenism. In a Bresson film protagonists function in any given narrative to fulfill whatever has been predestined for them to fulfill. They have no free will of their own and usually the film charts a journey which becomes in effect an unknowing search for spiritual redemption, for grace. Conventional character psychology has no place in a Bresson work - it doesn't matter what happens between life and death, the result will be the same - such is the nature of predestination. Throughout the protagonists will be `acted on' from on high as they are guided towards their fate. Diary of a Country Priest is the first Bresson film to really state all of this fully. If we compare the priest with the characters of Fontaine (A Man Escaped), Michel (Pickpocket), Jeanne (The Trial of Joan of Arc), the donkey Balthazar (Au hasard Balthazar) and Mouchette we find he is just one in a succession of surrogates for Jesus Christ negotiating the 7 Stations of the Cross on the way to Calvary and to an ultimate attainment of redemptive grace.

A negotiation of the 7 stations of the cross in a Bresson film necessitates a confrontation of the main character with the 7 deadly sins - lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride which should be (but mostly aren't) counter-balanced by the seven Catholic virtues - chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness and humility. This confrontation is faced head-on when the priest (Laydu) arrives in Normandy to take charge of his first parish having just qualified as a priest. The first thing to greet him through a barred gate is the Baron (Jean Riveyre ) kissing the governess (Nicole Maurey) of his daughter. The Baron looks at him as if he is an intruder and walks away without greeting. This `lust' is quickly followed by the `greed' of a rich landowner who refuses to pay the full price for his wife's funeral even though he can afford to; the `gluttony' of a serviceman who having told the priest he may receive electricity in his house after 3-4 months puts his efforts into arranging dance parties so the locals can binge themselves to his great profit; the `wrath' of his immediate superior the Priest of Torcy (Adrian Borel) who tells our hapless priest off for being too nave; the `envy' and the `pride' of the Baron's daughter Chantal (Nicole Ladmiral) who can't understand his power to make the Baroness (Rachel Brendt) get over the loss of her son and see the light of the Lord. Her mother's subsequent death gives her a chance to assert her `pride'. As inheritor of the estate she forces her father to send the governess away and to keep everything for herself.

Faced with an awful barrage of sin, the priest is shaken to the core of his being. He arrives at his parish already feeling sick with some vague kind of stomach complaint and we acknowledge his probable destiny. As he wanders from sinner to sinner constantly being used and abused he clings to his faith as a cripple might cling to his crutches. He only allows himself to consume dried bread soaked in red wine - transubstantiation evoking the Eucharist - God's body and spirit which he naively thinks is all he needs. But of course he wastes away and as the villagers turn on him (especially after the death of the countess which many - egged on by the daughter - suggest he caused) his consumption of wine is misinterpreted as alcoholism. This misinterpretation possibly turns into truth when he is forced to leave his parish and go to Lille to get a diagnosis of his medical condition. He learns he is in the last stages of stomach cancer. A long scene in a bar is followed by a visit to an old friend from the seminary who became a priest at the same time but has since given up the faith and is now living in sin with a woman who won't marry him. It is there that he spends his last days, eventually dying in complete apparent abjection. And yet as related right at the end through his friend's letter read out while Bresson's camera points at the shadow of a cross on the wall he still has faith and therefore has still lived the `right' life. As he famously says: ""What does it matter? All is grace"".

The mise-en-scne that Bresson deploys throughout this film to tell his metaphysical fable is extraordinarily concise in the way it stresses insistently how the priest is imprisoned within his own ascetic world which is cut-off from the real world in which he has to live. Note the very first sequence when he arrives. We see a close up of his face and then a shot of him through the bars of the chateau gate. Then we see the Baron and the governess kissing and the Baron's `keep your nose out of our business' look. We see at the very beginning that the priest is not welcome and will never be welcome. He will always be shut out, ostracized and marginalized. Also, of course, despite his huge efforts to try to get close to the villagers, he will always be shut in by the very nature of his appearance, his health, his inexperience as a priest and his nave attitude to those around him. Throughout the film Bresson shoots the priest through latticed windows, doorways and in confined spaces. This use of imprisonment came to the fore in Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne and will appear through the rest of his films. Usually this gives voice to the universal metaphysical yearning for freedom, for personal betterment, for spiritual rejuvenation, for release from one's constraints whether they be social, marital, material or of another kind. In this film the constraints are both imposed from outside (the village refusing to accept him) and from inside (his weakness at grasping and adapting to practicalities which could make his vocation easier).

The most interesting scene of the film is the one where the priest talks to the Baroness and scores the only `success' during his stay in this parish. The language is difficult and perhaps only Catholics will grasp the whole meaning. The situation is that the woman is living effectively alone. Her husband carries on affairs with other women while her daughter disrespects and ignores her. The only thing she has to cling onto is her love of her dearly departed - her son. No doubt this was the reason which turned her daughter against her and it has also made her into a selfish, withdrawn miserable wretch. And yet the priest makes her see the error in her ways (`sloth' perhaps) and the woman gradually is convinced so that she throws a locket containing a picture of her son into the fire. The priest quickly rescues it. At this point we hear the sound of raking coming from outside the window. Bresson cuts to show the daughter listening. The way she looks is the very picture of evil. It is as if the sound of the rake announces the arrival of Satan who will undermine the `goodness' done by the priest. Sure enough that night the Baroness dies and the daughter has spread the false rumor that the priest forced her to throw her locket into the fire. Instantly the whole village community is against him and his position is made untenable. The scene is obviously a Biblical parable demonstrating the hopelessness of preaching goodness in a spiritually polluted environment. In a world which is bad, to be good is bad and that is how the priest is made to feel. There is also the question of how the Countess died. Did she commit suicide having reconciled herself with God (in which case the priest did in a sense cause her death), or did her daughter see the chance to kill her mother off to inherit the estate and get rid of her father's lover? Bresson offers no firm answer, but the result is the priest's realization that his work in the parish is impossible and that he is literally being driven to an early death.

Bresson's film is rife with obscure religious references - the angel Seraphita (Martine Lemaire) who seems to rescue him after he falls down into the mud one night, the deep conversation he has with the Baron's son Olivier (Jean Danet) who is a member of the foreign legion and describes how people can be religious without having to dress up and pontificate like priests, his congregation of one person who writes telling him he should go way, the children who tease him while learning about the Eucharist, Chantal's `half-confession' from the box but to a priest who stands before her rather than one who is hidden behind a grill. I am not Catholic and cannot fully connect with this film `from within'. However, the priest's sufferings and the negotiation of the 7 Stations is an extraordinary spiritual journey and is very moving as a consequence. We watch this simpleton priest go about his business in the manner of Prince Myshkin from Dostoyevsky's The Idiot or of the priest Father Nazario from Luis Buuel's 1958 masterpiece Nazarn and feel nothing but profound pity for him and outrage at the horrors of the world he confronts. This is of course the world in which we live in as well and as the narrative is driven by a first person voice-over we feel completely for the character. Of all the characters in Bresson's films he is the only one to be accredited the same level of goodness and purity also allowed the donkey Balthazar and the saint Jeanne. The film may initially seem to be unbearably preachy and `starkly Catholic', but I urge viewers to watch it a couple of times. Give it some effort and you will be rewarded I'm sure. For me the film represents the spiritual essence of Bresson's world and is one of his most outstanding works.

This Optimum World Studio Canal release is outstanding. The digitalization is very successful. The images (aspect ratio 1.33:1 - 4:3) and mono sound are both ideally clear. Again one laments the complete absence of any extras. Of all Bresson's films this is the one in most need of a little explanation. Catholics may cotton on immediately to all the religious references, but for the rest of us it is rather hard to enter Bresson's world here. A little help from a sympathetic documentary or an informed commentary is surely essential for a film of this level of complexity. Never mind, the film is still an essential addition to your collection. The priest's emotional odyssey in a quest for spiritual grace is a journey I feel everyone, whatever their religious faith can relate to. Claude Laydu's performance is one which will stay with you forever once you have accessed Bresson's extraordinary world.",1411257600,3,13416,4.759879725085911
7900326,5,788572560X,"A deeply spiritual film that surpasses all other films about Catholic priests or nuns, with the exception of ""The Nun's Story,"" and ""Viridiana."" Moving, compelling, a conversion experience..and Bresson's landscapes, hues of black, gray, light gray, and white, the quick editing, the wonderful acting by Ayud as the priest and all of the rest of this amazing cast, make this a momentous film. Do not miss it.",1407888000,2,407,5.08955223880597
