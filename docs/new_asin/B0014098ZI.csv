8382026,3,B0014098ZI,"I was glad to finally find this movie on VHS due to only finding it once on TV back in the late 1980's. Since I was not able to find it on TV again, Amazon fortunately had some venders with good condition used VHS tapes available to buy at an affordable and reasonable price. I am very satisfied that I was able to finally locate this movie and watch it again. I was also surprised that there was a VHS tape made available for this even though it was a TV only movie.

This is a  movie for Paul LeMat fans even though it doesn't have the best story line or lighting to give it a more upbeat feeling. This may sound strange, but I just mainly wanted to see the minimal damage done to the thick rear bumper on the '67 Catalina compared to the damage of the mid 1980's Camaro in Paul LeMat's demolition scene of a guy in a Camaro following him.  That is my favorite part of the movie! Some other nostalgic parts of the movie involve his son's reference to some 1980's private eye shows like that of Magnum P.I., Simon & Simon, or Miami Vice.

The reason I did not give this movie five stars is that even though the plot is a simple and a somewhat wholesome 1980's story line without any vulgarities so the whole family can enjoy, the beginning of the movie seemed to be filmed at night or during low sunlight giving the movie a dark and dreary feeling for the first half of the movie. Once the second half of the movie started to show some sunlight, it was more enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, Paul LeMat did surprisingly well as a father figure and private eye detective.",1365206400,,1572,4.23
