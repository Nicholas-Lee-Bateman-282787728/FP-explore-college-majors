I bought this mainly for the Kodaly Cello sonata, and I was not disapointed. It is one thing to listen to the music, it is a revelation to watch it being played. Video quality is OK, given it was recorded in 1988. A live performance, but the audience does not intrude. Highly recommend!",1462665600,3,394,4.72463768115942

8633491,5,B00HM7TO38,This a very excellent dvd.  it is a live performance which makes you appreciate Starker's ability.  Cellists will gain a lot by watching his performance of these challenging works.,1416009600,2,180,5.172413793103448
