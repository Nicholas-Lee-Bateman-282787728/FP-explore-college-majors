1039264,3,6305495769,"This movie follows the story from previous versions and play presentations.  Looks like a lot of out of work actors including but not limited to Honor Blackman, Wendy Hiller, Olivia Hussey, and Carol Lynley.

The story starts out with an unnecessary introduction of want is to come with a hanging cat.

Just as a play only one person talks at a time. Each character is introduced and their peccadilloes explained. The dialog shows to be an attempt at humor. It also clings closely to one-liners as the Bob Hope version (1939) set in the 1920's. One added plus is that the credits showed the faces of the actors with the names; it is rare but keeps you from having to second guess who plays whom.

1934 20 years after old Cyrus West (Wilfrid Hyde White,) very a rich old man kicks the bucket, his will is about to reveal his heir. If the recipient proves to be insane or also kicks the bucket, then there is a second heir. To make things more complicated there may be a loose lunatic that escaped from a nearby asylum; they call him the cat.

Remember as Bismarck said ""a little caution outflanks a large cavalry""",1256342400,,1112,4.485148514851486

1039267,3,6305495769,"Its interesting when watching some of these old movies from the 60's, 70's and even to a certain extent from the 80's to observe how film making techniques and acting styles change over the years. Given today's penchant for much more gruesome thrillers, this film from the 70's (itself a remake) is rather tame. It's a stylish and well acted tale of a family gathered together for the reading of a will (""Leeches All"") and we all know that before morning maybe one or more will be dead.

Its quite old fashioned and melodramatic in places and the cast of stalwarts all look like they are having a blast and each has a 'chewing the scenery' moment. Whatever happened to Carol Lynley? she was certainly talented and her 'english' accent is not bad at all.",1161561600,2,753,4.5777777777777775

1039269,2,6305495769,"I bought this DVD in hopes it would be great but instead I find it to be just an average film. This story has been done different times and I can tell you that the absolute best version is the Bob Hope version (Cat and The Canary 1939). That film unfortunately isn't available. Another good version which is available is the silent one from around 1927 and it does a good job too.  If I were you, I would try to locate those versions before ever getting this version. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't bad but it just doesn't stand up to the other 2 versions.  The premise is as follows on this 1978 version: Glencliff Manor, 1934. A dark/stormy night. The family of a deceased millionaire has been summoned for the reading of his final will and testiment.  An unexpected visitor arrives, the chief psychologist from the local mental hospital who is searching for a dangerous criminal escapee. Turn off the lights and you can enjoy this one but I am spoiled by the 2 far better versions so please if you can, see the 1939 Cat and The Canary with Bob Hope and or see the silent 1927 version. Those I promise will make you forget this one.",1012435200,19,1139,4.363207547169812

1039271,5,6305495769,"The year is 1934.  Precisely twenty years has passed since the timely death of Cyrus West.  And now, since where there is a will, there's a way--It's time to celebrate!--One of our lucky guests (all of whom are related) will inherit a fortune via a reading from beyond the grave!  This whimsical film is designed for an intelligent audience.  Its characters are (with a few dastardly exceptions) highly likable people engaging in interesting conversations.  Exclusively filmed in London, England, we soon find ourselves surrounded by a most fitting ambiance: Spooky house, too much floor space, constant downpour, a frequent roar of thunder, and the most wonderful indoor fire one could imagine!  It's great--In fact perfect--For anyone who is a chicken at heart but wants desperately to enjoy a horror movie!  You see, it seems the technical crew didn't quite want to really frighten us.  Perhaps the intention was just to get us thinking a bit.  For one thing, no one seems concerned about (what is certain to be) a shocking electric bill as the lighting is near brilliant at all times (obviously, the old and remarkable mansion wasn't refurbished with dimmer switches)!  Dinner is served, the main course being ""Bombay Chicken (with extra curry)"".  ""I think this chicken died in 1914,"" announces one uninhibited soul.  Next come the creeping shadows (""only the shadow knows""), secret passageways, escape hatches, screams in the night, a character who disappears in the middle of conversation, an old clock that starts to chime but never finishes, and yes, even a beautiful black cat.  Enter (speaking of beauty) actress Olivia Hussey (""Cicily Young"") who proves she is equally splendid with make-up as she is without (for suitable comparison, please see her in the notorious ""Black Christmas"" which is most definitely NOT for the faint of heart).  Olivia does it a lot with her eyes not to mention a very appropriate and low cut red dress.  At one point, left in the bedroom by herself a bit too long, ""Cicily"" remarks (upon her roommates' eventual return), ""Where have you been?"";  Roommate: ""Not far.""; Cicily: ""Being alone in this place gives me the double creeps.""  Also joining the party are a host of charming characters who are dressed quite stiffly in formal attire consistent with the time period. There's ""Harry"", a naturally likable chap; The wrinkly ""Mrs. Pleasant""; Mrs. Crosby (full of stately mannerisms); The lovely ""Annabelle"" (wrinkle free); ""Susan"", outspoken, and in need of a large mole being removed from the left side of her face); And ""Paul"", a fine gentleman but also Annabelle's ""kissin' cousin"".  There's also a surprise guest from ""down the way"" who comes barging on the scene to announce (in Paul Revere fashion), ""There's an escaped homicidal maniac on the loose who has escaped from a home for the criminally insane!"" . . . ""We're just up the road,"" he adds.  Furthermore, he always tries to get in A HOUSE whenever he escapes!  Then he likes to hide!  ""I'm asking everyone in the area to lock themselves in until morning,"" adds this bearer of ""good tidings"".  This provokes quite a reaction among the genetically predispositioned (mental illness happens to run in the family) (""Remember: Cream first, and coffee later"").  A couple of gems:  ""I don't know why I should be glum""; ""Well, I wasn't mad when I came here, but I certainly will be soon!""  Get a grip! The relatives can all take comfort in knowing that Mr. West knows something they don't!  None of us thought it would turn into this type of evening, but not to worry: All of the jolts are left in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.",972345600,25,3621,4.933993399339934

1039362,1,6305495769,"This is a remake of a respectable comedy thriller (Bob Hope, believe it or not) and the viewer is left wanting to kill the perpetrator of this awful script and the extravagantly untalented director. A mixture of class and common comprises the cast list: Dame Wendy Hiller and Honor Blackman (Pussy Galore in Goldfinger and Cathy Gale in The Avengers)are underused in thankless parts making way for the inept and wooden Carol Lynley and other duds like Michael Callan (Who? Don't ask me!)and forgettable others. This is so forgettable and derivative and abysmal I have forgotten what the premise is: people being lured to a haunted house and dying one by one. This neolithic plot has been done well in films like ""And Then There Were None"" (1945) and the Agatha Christie all-star films of the 1970s but this dog (1978) has no bark, no bite and certainly no laughs. It has BOREDOM in abundance. Before this film even begins there needed only to be one attack: the chopping off of the scriptwriter's hand.",1361836800,,1002,4.764367816091954

1039366,3,6305495769,"The 1922 play THE CAT AND THE CANARY was so popular that it made the fortune of author John Willard, who lived to see it filmed no fewer than three times before his death in 1942. Even today the story remains a classic of its kind, inspiring a host of films that mix comedy, mystery, and horror--not to mention still more that focus on suspicious doings in old, dark houses. The plot is a classic: a group of relatives are summoned to an isolated house to hear a reading of a will that leaves a vast fortune to only one of them, a circumstance that places the heir in significant danger from an unknown but alternative heir.

The 1927 silent film directed by Paul Leni is arguably the best film interpreation of the stage play, dark, creepy, and filled with comic stereotypes and cliches. The 1939 film starring Bob Hope is arguably the most famous film version of the play, not quite as dark and creepy but filled with Hope's unique brand of humor. And then there is the 1979 version, which isn't in the least bit dark and creepy, transports the story to 1930s England, and plays out very much like a drawing room comedy. In this version the star is Carol Lynley, a very pretty and often under-rated actress, who finds herself a somewhat uncomfortable heiress under the same roof with a host of hungry relatives and quite possibly a homocidal maniac called ""The Cat"" who has escaped from a nearby insane asylum. Lynley is well supported by a memorable cast that includes Honor Blackman, Michael Callan, Wendy Hiller, Olivia Hussey, Daniel Massey, and perhaps most memorably Wilfred Hyde-White, who plays the deceased and puts in an appearance to read his own will via an early talking picture.

This particular version of the play contains several radical departures from previous film incarnations. Instead of a gloomy house with cobwebs and tattered curtains, it is set in a meticulously clean and brightly lit mansion where even the furniture dust covers seem to have been recently ironed. The film is somewhat surprising for a movie of this era in that it presents two implied homosexual relationships--one between two women, which is presented as exotic, and one between two men, which is presented as highly negative. Even more surprisingly, the film has more than a touch of sexual sadism to it. There's even a nasty basement torture chamber. The sexual disposition of the gay and lesbian characters is not openly specified (the most we get on screen is a backrub), the worst of the violence occurs entirely off-screen, and the blood and gore is confined to brief glimpses, sudden cut-aways, and character reaction to the sight of it all.

Not only do the characters search the house for the lunatic and missing people, they also search for a famous--and famously missing--set of diamonds; walls slide open and secret passages are revealed; clocks chime unexpectedly and thunder rolls incessantly; and long fingers with sharp nails flash across the screen. The cast is good--especially Wendy Hiller and Wilfred Hyde-White. The direction is good and the production values are good. But on the whole the film seems excessively mild, never quite dark enough, never quite funny enough, and in terms of pacing never quite quick enough. Still, it is a pleasant romp, and fans of the play and the earlier versions are likely to enjoy it. The DVD picture has an occasional and unfortunate jump, but it isn't too annoying, and the sound elements are good. The DVD also includes a bonus in the form of written notes and photographs from earlier versions of the story.

Everyone involved must have signed on without reading the script, or been blackmailed into participating. I watched it only to see how it compares to the Paul Leni silent version, which is dated but fun, and achieves a creepy atmosphere that this one, with all its constant thunder and stupid addition of sadistic torture-murder simply can't muster. Honestly, the star of the whole thing is Honor Blackman's gold silk dressing gown. Even if you find some way to enjoy this debacle, it's a solid half hour too long.

7890559,2,6305495769,"If you want a good thriller, bypass this mess and watch the 1939 version with Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard, which had a much better storyline, old-time suspense and a better cast of characters.  The newer version switches the locale from the Louisiana Bayou to Britain, and cast a bunch of hammy stars with a creepy, sadistic undertone.  I like all the actors in this version, but the grouping is so wrong for all of them.  The best part is given to Michael Callan, who gets to play the Bob Hope role and brings out his comedic flair.  He is the most likable too.  Carol Lynley is beautiful and sympathetic, and does give a fair effort.  But do yourself a favor--get the older version.",1441584000,,686,4.491935483870968

Scenes of torture and dead bodies are not something to let kids watch.  Having said that, the story itself keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for the killer to pop-out of hiding.  This movie, I believe, was made in the 70's, when this type of movie was the norm for suspense-murder thrillers.  Probably won't watch it again, though, because of above mentioned cons.
