2551474,5,B000F4RHQG,"Excellent movie!

Acting was superb, scenery fantastic and theme is an often recurring theme which is rarely treated with the reality this film shows.

The side effects of the experiments makes one wonder about the real the possibility of immortality and its effects on the multiple facets of society.

Nanotechnology is no longer fiction, and will eventually become an essential part of the scientific arena as well as the medical one.

All in all, the film is incredibly hypnotizing and disturbing.... a true thriller and a must see.",1154131200,11,535,5.045454545454546
2551475,5,B000F4RHQG,Subject Two was the best movie that we have seen in quite some time.  BRAVO!  The filmmaker did a superb job in all aspects.  We are hoping for a sequel.  You won't fall asleep during this movie!,1153267200,5,195,4.1891891891891895
2551476,2,B000F4RHQG,"When I saw the blurb for this I thought: ""interesting"". But despite sincere efforts on the part of the filmmakers, this is a film that simply doesn't work. The story is boring, the makeup is awful and the acting is even worse. It was totally amateur and I found myself looking at my watch aching for it to be over. The music? Anyone with a cheesy Roland synth could replicate it, maybe even do a better job. Sorry, but this isn't even a ""so bad it's good"" title. I will say this: Dean Stapleton does the most perfect imitation of Jack Nicholson / Randle Patrick McMurphy I've seen to date - it really is convincing. Also the digital cinematography is very crisp, especially the bright, outdoor scenes in the mountains.",1152835200,,718,4.530769230769231
2551477,4,B000F4RHQG,"I was lucky enough to catch this film this past April while visiting Chicago. It's release has been very limited, but fortunately, we have the DVD release to look forward to this summer, currently scheduled for the 18th of July. Those people who like to throw genre labels onto films may have a tough time with this one. It's got sci-fi, horror, drama and even some dark comedy, but ultimately, it's simply absorbing. In a nutshell, Subject Two features a character by the name of Adam Schmidt, a troubled medical student who receives a call from Dr. Franklin Vick, who offers Adam the chance to work alongside side with him on an experiment that he's been keeping under wraps in his residence high up amid snow covered mountains.

What the good doc doesn't tell Adam is that the main Subject he is using is actually Adam, Subject Two (hence the title.) Dr. Vick is experimenting with resurrection. Catching him off guard, Dr. Vick kills Adam and then brings him back to life a short while later. After Dr. Vick explains to Adam what the experiment is all about, Adam agress to be his guinea pig, which leads to more death episodes for Adam, who has now agreed to die over and over. That's all I'll say about the storyline. The film is best viewed without knowing too much. Subject Two may  have been filmed on a limited budget, but there's nothing cheap about the quality. There's a few noticeable technical bumps in the film, but nothing to hamper it. The acting is excellent. Dean Stapleton's spooky-sexy performance as the unrelenting Dr. Vick is quite impressive. At times he seems a bit unstable, but yet has his moments of sensitive emotions which he tries to hide from Adam. Christian Oliver is convincing as the introverted medical student willing to try something that could possibly kill him for good. Just when you think you have him pegged, he does some things that makes you wonder if he may have more in common with Dr. Vick than we thought. There's a fairly brief but memorable performance by Jurgen Jones as a hunter who accidentally mistakes Adam for game and shoots him dead... or so he thinks. His surprise when Adam stands up and starts to talk to him is wonderfully comic. Sure, he may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but you can't help but feel sorry for the guy.

Then there's the music. Full of lush intensity and doom, it's never intrusive. Instead, it seeps into your skin and makes it crawl. Immediately after seeing the film, I got to speak to Dean Stapleton and Christian Oliver. I asked how they could afford an orchestra for the film's score, only to be informed that all of the music was performed by composer Eric Godal.

The scenery is spectacular. It's interesting how snow covered mountains can look so beautiful and creepy at the same time, but that's probably due to the whole tension of the film, thanks mainly to Director and writer Philip Chidel, who also makes a brief but chilling performance in the film.

Don't miss this one, folks. It may be hard to shake off right away after seeing it, but that's what a well done thriller is supposed to do, right?",1147651200,31,3103,4.603978300180832
2551488,4,B000F4RHQG,"When you turn on a flick and think you're some sort of movie critic, looking to tear things apart and criticize it, you'll always find flaws. If you like a good, weird movie, this is totally worth renting. I'll be buying it to add to my, sacred, permanent collection.

You have to take it for what it's worth. Screw ""similarities,"" it's completely original. If you allow yourself, you become instantly and eerily engulfed in the story. The casting and acting are superb. The setting is phenomenal. The movie is a great mix of subtle humor and freakishness. An excellent, laid back movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon. Does it deserve awards? Probably not. But, if you're not too picky and like good, weird movies, you'll enjoy this one - trust me.",1369353600,,750,4.681818181818182
2551489,2,B000F4RHQG,"Nano technology which has created wondrous things like non-stick ketchup bottles can now resurrect life. Adam Schmidt (Christian Oliver) becomes a guinea pig in this experiment as he is repeatedly killed and revived in a remote snowy cabin. It was cute and clever the first few times, but the interest of this new technology and Adam's ""Gary Mitchell"" contacts becomes boring as you wait for some new revelation that never occurs.

The film has a slight twist, although by that point I had lost interest. The acting was decent in what was basically a two man play. The movie is more interesting than entertaining.

2551490,1,B000F4RHQG,This movie is so bad I don't even know where to begin. The acting is so bad that it felt like a really bad joke. Another reviewer stated that it wasn't obvious that it was a low budget movie and I had to wonder if we were watching the same movie. I'm simply astounded by the number of 3 star reviews...I can't figure out what anyone saw in this. I wish I could get a refund!,1346457600,,374,3.9342105263157894
2551491,4,B000F4RHQG,I distrubingly liked this movie. The message of the dangers with playing god with things only god should control is very evident.

2551492,5,B000F4RHQG,"YES!!! Another GREAT movie I had never heard about until suddenly stumbling across it here on Amazon. At first I wasn't sure, but something inside me told me this would be good and I was right. Totally worth the rental or purchase price where ever you decide to do so. HEADS UP...... This is NOT a zombie/undead or vampire movie, it is totally on it's own. Enjoy!",1341360000,,363,4.432835820895522
2551493,3,B000F4RHQG,"First, about the movie. It is very well made and is basically a redux of the Shelly's old Frankenstein concept. The actors perform well and the movie as a whole is an excellent example of what probably was a direct to video vehicle.
My major concern is on what basis does Amazon use to price its rentals? I saw this movie for free on another streaming channel close to two years ago if my memory serves me right and here Amazon is offering it for rent for $2.99. One again questions their Amazon Prime Membership when movies that are getting a bit long in the tooth since they were released are still costing Amazon Prime members $2.99 to rent. If any movie qualifies for free viewing for Prime members then surely this movie does.
I just cannot find any rhyme nor reason concerning Amazons policy concerning which movies are available for free viewing for their Prime Members and which arent. ""Shooters"" is available for free viewing, was and remains much more popular and yet ""Subject 2"" carries with it a $2.99 premium. ""Shooters"" is also of more recent vintage than this movie. I simply don't understand.
I have questioned by phone and email Amazons Customer Support about situations such as this and the seeming lack of new videos being made available for Amazon Prime Members. I would hope that someday word gets to the appropriate person and that a review of Amazons Prime Membership free viewing titles be made. As the situation now stands there is simply no rational explanation as to which movies are available for free viewing and which ones are not. And the long established lack of new movies made available for free viewing by Prime Members still exists. Will I continue to be a Prime Member when it comes time to renew again? That is a good question and is up to the decision makers at Amazon. The primer reason I am an Amazaon Prime Memeber is because it allows me access to both free and paid rentals and the occasional video purchase for streaming purposes. I am anything but happy with the current policy of the lack of new content of ""free"" movie rentals for my Prime Memebership dues.
If you are considering becoming a Prime Member, do not expect anything approaching a great deal of new titles becoming made available for free viewing for your $79.99 annual fee. Unless you have a great need for second day delivery of a goodly portion of products ordered through Amazon you should consider whether or not the Prime Membership dues are worthwhile. Do not base your joining on the hopes of there being an abundance of new movies becoming available for free viewing for your Amazon Prime Membership, at least not as long as current policy exists.",1341100800,,2666,4.674468085106383
2551494,1,B000F4RHQG,I cannot believe I wasted 2.99 to rent this movie. It is the kind that Mystery Science Theater 3000 used to make fun of. But I tried to watch it without their witty comments. I want my money back!!!!,1339286400,,199,4.128205128205129
2551495,5,B000F4RHQG,"What is it about a snow-filled setting that invites so much more atmosphere to both horror and romance?? It's practically primal in its appeal.

In this case, it scared me. I don't really watch horror all that much because it's mostly so lame... but I saw this while away in the mountains and it only heightened its effect upon me. The isolation. The beauty. The nature that would just as soon kill you as enchant you. The tone and snowy scenery of this story is truly haunting. If you don't see it as a 5-star flick, that's okay... these things are relative and it is isn't a high budget film... and you probably didn't see it while in the middle of nowhere as I did. I'm okay with a 4-star rating, too.

The plot involves a young, handsome medical student who is lured to a remote cabin via the Internet by a Jack Nicholson-looking Dr. Franklin Vick... a younger, sexier version of our adorably evil Jack Nicholson, lol... but that crazy vibe is still there.

The young and naive Adam suffers from debilitating migraines and in his vulnerability and deprived existence finds solace in the presence of this seemingly protective and visionary doctor. He willingly becomes a very submissive volunteer to Dr. Vick and his mysterious serum (symbolic?? lol). These two share quite a bit of chemistry and the trust Adam puts in this sexy-sinister doctor is just tragic. Some choices last forever.

This is a Frankenstein story... it's a zombie story... it will give you the creeps if you watch it late at night!! The contrasts of natural beauty and eternal damnation are startling. Loved it.

It's been a long time since I was really moved by a horror story. Highly recommended spooky stuff!!",1320537600,3,1687,4.705084745762712
2551496,3,B000F4RHQG,"GROUNDHOG DAY MEETS FRANKENSTEIN?
Beautiful albeit chilling setting (Aspen's never looked snowier) and a haunting musical score provide a frigid backdrop for this interesting take on Shelley's durable tale of dangerous resurrection.  Our doctor (Franklin Vick) is an obvious homage to Victor Frankenstein and Subject Two is appropriately named Adam.
Christian Oliver and Dean Hamilton shoulder the bulk of the movie quite well and the twist is unexpected.  It is a tad slow but it's not boring and for a reported $23,000 budget, SUBJECT TWO comes off impressively.",1303344000,5,564,5.3977272727272725
2551497,2,B000F4RHQG,"If a egocentrical mad scientist unexpectantly kills his assistant and then, that assistant is resurrected, shouldn't that assistant want to give a little payback towards his murderer? I mean, like, the first thing I would have done would have been to look at my murderer and extract a quick revenge! You can't murder me and get away with it!

I know I'm taking a horror film way too seriously but that's the problem I had with it. It's a ""Hey stupid, don't open that door"" situation.

I found this mildly creative spin on the Frankerstein/Zombie genre a bit too contrived.

Also, the two main actors seemed ill- conceived for their roles. These guys looked like fashion models portraying eccentric characters holed up in the rugged mountains? They seemed too far off to be playing these characters. Would you accept Zha Zha Gabor playing a homicide detective?

To catch this on TV may be an entertaining surprise. To actually shell out money for this....I don't know!",1297641600,,967,4.842424242424243
2551508,4,B000F4RHQG,"It took me awhile before I realized Subject Two was actually a modern remake of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The first hint is the name of the doctor, ""Franklyn Vick"" (Jack Nicholson clone Dean Stapleton), a take on Dr. Victor Frankenstein from the novel.  The second hint is the name of his patient, Adam (Christian Oliver) - the name Shelley gave the monster.

In modern parlance, Frankenstein's monster was the first zombie.  That connection is made clear in Subject Two, where poor Adam is lured to Dr. Vick's cabin, brutally strangled, and then resuscitated...again and again and again.

Subject Two takes place a snowy mountainous region is as much a character as doctor and patient. The place looks and feels isolated enough that we believe Vick can get away with murder.

Subject Two is so sparse that it could easily be a stage play; there are only two additional characters, and both are intruders to the cozy world of master and servant, doctor and patient. The first is the monster's potential mate, Kate (all-American girl Courtney Mace).  Her presence is brief, but the promise of a date is a tantalizing reminder of our own mortality: love, marriage, children.  Dr. Vick takes it all away.

The other character is a nameless hunter (Jurgen Jones) who accidentally stumbles on the odd couple's secret.  The outsider presence is an important test of Adam's faith in his creator. His fate is a pivotal turning point in Vick and Adam's relationship.

Throughout, the experiment is a grim reminder of science at its worst. He feigns impartiality by talking into his recorder, then murders his creation as violently as possible.  Vick alternates between fretting over Adam's pain and causing it.  If there's a message in Subject Two, it's that life is pain - experiencing it is an important part of what makes life worth living. To avoid pain is to become inhuman.

Subject Two could easily be a half hour shorter. There are long shots of people stumping around in the snow intercut with flashbacks and red blood cells.  But if you're patient, Subject Two is quite rewarding. The twist ending neatly ties up a scene early in the movie that starts, literally, with a bang. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get there.",1292889600,4,2230,4.865079365079365

2551510,4,B000F4RHQG,"Subject 2 immediately drew me into the film's story and characters.  I had no information about the film at all.  I tend to avoid reading ""reviews"" before seeing a film for myself.  There are too many people out there giving away the plotlines, ruining my reactions to things happening on-screen.

This is a magnificently staged production.  Fantastic scoring, brilliant plot (with twists) and the acting was perfect.  This could have been so overwhelmingly heavy, but this film was done with a lighter directorial hand, making it more realistic than sensationalistic.

If I had to classify this film I would call it a ""Thriller.""  The fact that the experiments are probably already being performed in the real world, minimalizes the illusion of a mad scientist performing horrifying experiments on innocents, thusly the Science Fiction label would be misleading.

Good stuff!!!",1261785600,2,878,5.258992805755396

SUBJECT TWO takes elements of the FRANKENSTEIN story, and gives them a modern jolt of bloody insanity. It's pretty much a two-man show, w/ Oliver and Stapleton at a remote, mountain lodge. Still, the story is intriguing (and horrific) enough to make things move right along. There's more to S2 than simply raising the dead, as the ethics of such a venture are disected and analyzed. This relatively obscure movie deserves a chance. Check it out...",1244851200,3,623,4.942857142857143
2551513,3,B000F4RHQG,"Subject Two (Philip Chidel, 2006)

Odd little thriller packed with black humor and competent acting that still somehow manages to not quite gel. There's a great deal of potential here (and I have a suspicion that had it been played more as a comedy, it might have come off a lot better), but it falls a bit short of the mark.

The movie starts with headstrong medical student and blogger Adam (Speed Racer's Christian Oliver), on the verge of getting thrown out of school, responding to an email from a doctor who follows his blog and wants him to come out and be an assistant in his remote hideaway. Can you tell this is not going to end well? Once he gets there, he finds that Vick (Wildflower's Dean Stapleton), the doctor in question, is working on an offshoot of cryogenics. Problem is, what he needs is a test subject, and after Adam says he wants to help, Vick comes up behind Adam and slashes his throat. Vick then injects him with a serum designed to revive him, and... Adam wakes up. Not only that, but the migraines he's been suffering all his life have disappeared. Adam eagerly offers to help Vick perfect the serum. This involves Adam dying again and again as Vick tweaks the formula.

The majority of the film is a two-person joint, which can be either brilliant or awful, depending on how it's handled. This one is much closer to brilliant, but not quite. It's quite well-paced, and the dialogue is good enough to keep the movie from becoming boring. But it seemed to me while I was watching that there was something missing. I'm not entirely sure what, but the tipoff was that the setup for the twist at the end seemed pretty obvious. I wasn't exactly sure my guess was right (it was), but I knew that something was coming. It's almost as if the script were missing a layer somehow. Which doesn't make it bad, don't get me wrong, just...unfinished.

as they watch the victim transform.  For the first time, our Frankenstein doctor uses terms to describe neuronal processes responsible for the victims mood swings that are based in neuroscience,not only educating us but allowing, momentarily, for the viewer to be overwhelmed by a world he cannot see.

Enough people have commented on what the film is about so i'll just skip that.

This re-imagining of Frankenstein is carefully executed (pun intended.)

There are only 6 actors in this film. Two miles high in the Rocky Mountains is a gorgeous yet isolated setting. The majesty of the vistas is balanced by the claustrophobia of the knotty pine wood hut. The similarly small budget benefits the film.

Although the blood-soaked clothing is way too red and the contact lenses are a bit distracting. At least there is no CGI monster. Nothing takes me out of a film experience like CGI.

All of the actors are solid and Courtney Mace is perfectly sweet as the siren that gives Adam her telephone number knowing that she will never see him again.

8117458,5,B000F4RHQG,"This is a very weird movie. When I first watched it, I could not believe I wasted two hours of my life. When I woke up the next day, I understood and could not believe its genius. An amazing and incredibly true description of the nature of emotions, of being a sensitive or oversensitive person. I recommend it to all very sensitive and oversensitive people - only these are able to get it.",1454716800,2,390,4.3561643835616435
8117459,5,B000F4RHQG,"I enjoyed this movie, especially when I read how they produced it: short budget and practically using a skeleton crew living onsite in the wilderness.. I found the story line disturbing ( which I want in a horror-thriller) and the location was breathtaking as was the photography. I really love Subject Two.. Thank you.",1421539200,,319,4.925925925925926
