7888765,3,6305321965,"This 4 volume set covers both United States & British jet bombers: B-1, B-2, B-52, Canberra, F-111. B-36, F-105 & Buccaneer in 8 half hour episodes. The quality of stock footage used goes from almost unwatchable to pristine. Of the 8 bombers featured, the 4 episodes with the overall highest visual quality were the B-1, B-2, Canberra & Buccaneer. The poor quality stock footage for the B-52, F-111, B-36 and F-105 severly limited the enjoyment of these episodes. As an aviation buff, I was extremely happy to see the episodes on the Canberra and Buccaneer. Here in the States, it's difficult to find good documentaries on these marvelous British aircraft and their inclusion in this set is greatly appreciated.  The narration for all episodes ranged from highly informative regarding the research, design, politics and operational problems with a particular aircraft to rambling techno-babble listing specific armament and ECM equipment carried. Often, the narration did not match up with the visual image on the screen causing confusion as to what was actually being shown on the screen and its significance. Overall, this collection is definitely ""a mixed formation."" However, if you're looking for good coverage of the B-1 and B-2 and especially the British bombers, Canberra and Buccaneer, you will be very happy with these 4 episodes.",979516800,,1340,5.203703703703703
