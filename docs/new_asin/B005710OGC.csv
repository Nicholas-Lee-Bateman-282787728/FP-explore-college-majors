4593364,5,B005710OGC,"I really enjoyed this brief series.  6 under 30's sharing a house with 6 over 70's.  After initial distrust and tredidation these twelve housemates reached open- minded surprise insights.  It was fun to watch them enjoying each other's company, sharing ideas, and having fun TOGETHER!  I'm 62 and have a 72 yr old ""forever young"" brother and our late parents were born in 1905 and 1910.  Mixing generations really works!  I thank God my family exposed me to such an array of music,  humor and sensibilities.  I saw the same growth speeded up on this delightful show.  Many of us fans who wrote in are not usually into reality shows.  This one is a cut above and leaves you feeling good!",1370217600,2,686,4.595041322314049
4593365,4,B005710OGC,"I'm over network tv and Kim Kardashian and all the dumb reality shows that really aren't real.  I'm sick of the swamp people, hog killers, and repo people.  If that's your thing then that's cool; it's not mine.  With some of the garbage on tv, it's pretty hard to find something that you feel good watching, but Forever Young did it for me.

When I first saw the previews, I thought it would be about a bunch of arrogant spoiled little twenty somethings who felt they had all the answers.  Toss in a bunch of old, irritable and bitter men and women who would both make my skin crawl, and that was my first impressions.  Most 20 somethings on these kind of shows are pretty sleazy and wild and that seems to be what some like; I don't.  I pre-judged the show but I still wanted to give it a shot and I was totally wrong.

The show ended up being about good people who weren't out to be famous or begging for attention, but who had various flaws just like you and I.  The show mainly showed how each age group thinks differently about different situations and in the end both age groups ended up making the other better.  There wasn't a lot of drama or fighting which was great.

It was funny to see the great differences in the groups when they would pair a young and old person together and then have them do a chore that both generations were foreign too.  Each episode would have different tasks and they would break off in teams, with one elderly person and one young person on each team.

TVLAND only did 6 original episodes because they wanted to see how popular the show can and might be, which is bush league to me.  I understand it but at least do 10 episodes.  Three hours of programming doesn't make a series and isn't a good indicator.

The ratings were near the top 18-20 range for cable and I hope that is enough for a second year.  I hope also they don't ruin the show or the people by giving away a lot of money, or by creating drama.  In Forever Young there is a group of people for everyone to like, and I'm sure if you get into the show you will all have your favorites.  If you like every day good people, you will like this show.",1370217600,,2149,4.223039215686274
4593366,5,B005710OGC,This was a great way to show the contrast in the two age groups.  LOVED each and every character.  Great show.  Hope to see more episodes in the future.,1369440000,2,152,4.172413793103448
4593367,5,B005710OGC,"Well demonstrated, uncomplicated exercises done at home with little or no equipment. Not overly  strenuous but effective. As usual Jack instructs, educates, and encourages with a ""can-do"" approach. In this video, Jack and his wife, who ""walked the talk"" of exercise and healthy diet over a lifetime, serve as models to heed this fitness pioneer's wisdom.",1335225600,7,354,5.321428571428571

4593391,5,B005710OGC,"As a complete series, I really liked it a lot.
There is a lot to learn about the young and old age groups coming together and learning from each other. And in between the learning there is comedy, sadness and  being serious. ""Forever Young"" should never have been dropped from the network.

Please try and get the same ""stars"" back together again.",1407283200,,347,4.580645161290323
4593392,5,B005710OGC,"There is one chapter that demonstrates how to make Bananas a la Elaine, and this recipe is worth the price of the this DVD, so really, you should treat yourself.  This recipe looks like a gooey sugary desert, but is actually sugar free and delicious and fast and easy to make.  I made some for the AARP monthly pot luck, and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.

I like Jack not only for his exercise routines, but also especially his motivational tips, and his philosophy toward choices of foods (eating healthy).",1405900800,2,524,4.612903225806452
4593393,5,B005710OGC,"I started exercising with Jack LaLanne back in the 60""s. These are wonderful body exercises that anyone can do and you work at your own pace.  I highly recommend it for beginners as well as anyone else.",1393891200,2,202,4.45945945945946

4593395,5,B005710OGC,"I was skeptical when I ordered this CD but I remembered Jack Lalanne when I was a kid.  Let me tell you, don't think this is an easy workout to follow.  You only need a chair, but if you follow the CD, you will get a full body workout and it is HARD.  Great CD and I highly recommend it.  He is amazing.",1383436800,8,303,3.761904761904762
4593396,4,B005710OGC,"The premise of this reality show is good but can't see going very far with this type of show.  We only watched one episode, so I may not be the one to give a good review of this show.",1378339200,,183,3.6923076923076925
4593397,5,B005710OGC,"I think you have a great idea only it needs to be elaborated more and the adults need to have fun but at the same time grow up themselves,set the example, with respect even if the kids lost it.  I thought that  Arthur Albert did the best,, especially when the girl began to cry & the other one calmed down. I think Arthur had a better repoire with the kids than any one else; a good listener. Keep going,you are on to something, there are a few kids out there who will learn something from this. There are a lot of young adults that are lonely, lost,  a wall built up, looking for respect, understanding and most of all to feel loved.  Good luck",1376524800,,645,4.17741935483871

8460160,3,B005710OGC,I remember Jack LaLanne shows and there was more exercise done than commercials. I would rather have videos of his old shows not a new one made for selling.,1474934400,,156,4.413793103448276
