8412357,5,B0040IID20,"""Good Eats"" travels south for inspiration in this three DVD set that covers a wide range of southern delicacies. Not that Alton Brown had to go far, being an Atlanta resident, but some truly classic preparations are shared in these episodes. My favorite DVD was ""Down South Eats"" where I particularly enjoyed the okra preparations (Slime!) in ""Okraphobia"". (Please note the hilarious guest appearance of the Delta State Fighting Okra mascot!) The other DVDs contained lots of basic and very useful concoctions (e.g. white roux, corn tortillas, etc.) and some a bit more esoteric (e.g. ""Avocado Buttercream Frosting""). While I was very interested in how Alton (a paid professional) deep fried a turkey, that is one preparation I will never attempt due to safety (and calorie) concerns.

This is a great set. In all honesty, I will be unlikely to make (or imitate) most of the recipes seen in this set, but I found it to be interesting and amusing (any dish named ""Flandango"" has to be worth a look!), and I have no reservations recommending these discs.",1445644800,2,1052,4.910112359550562
