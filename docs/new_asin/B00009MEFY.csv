7991436,2,B00009MEFY,"THE DARK SIDE is a sleazy, lurid and sometimes confusing ""tnriller"" short on thrills and suspense, these traits only appearing in the last fifteen minutes of the film.  Janet Kidder plays twin sisters, Jane and Megan.  Jane is a messed up call girl, video actress and all around failure.  Megan is a successful lawyer involved with a handsome young man, planning on tying the knot.  One night Jane calls Megan and tells her she's done something awful she can't be forgiven for, and then plunges to her death fifty feet from her apartment building.  Jane decides she wants to get to know more about her sister and why she apparently took her own life.  Megan goes to her sister's neighborhood, moves into her apartment, wears her clothes, and frequents the tawdry hangouts, soon having difficulty discovering who's who.  A strange young man named Michael is at Jane's funeral and soon she finds herself drawn to him, even though there's a possibility he was stalking her.  WAS Jane murdered?  And if so, by whom?  The resolution to this is fairly predictable, and there's an over the top confrontation between Megan and the killer.
Janet Kidder (sister to Superman's Margot) has the emotional range of a rutabaga.  The dual role is just too much for her to handle.
Patsy Kensit (who is usually very good) is wasted as Jane's friend Vicki.
Jason Priestley looking like a seedier Don Johnson or young Ed Harris, is the mysterious Michael, and his unexplicable outburst in one scene is never explained.
That leaves Paul Johannson as Megan's love who manages to steal the picture, even though his screen time is minimal.  His line, ""Stop yanking my chain"" is one of the most I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WROTE THAT lines in recent cinematic history.
THE DARK SIDE is slow, pondering and filmed shoddily.  Johannson's performance, however, gives it two stars.",1084492800,2,1845,4.856230031948882
