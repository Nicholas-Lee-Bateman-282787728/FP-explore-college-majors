2353392,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I think Janis is selling herself short with the title - this is really an all-over body toner, not just a glute workout.  She does work the glutes though (really works them!) but also includes some great upper body work too.
You begin with the 7 min warm-up, then into 30 min standing sculpting.  This is almost aerobic with lunges, squats, plies and deadlift ""combos"" - but Janis also ads in some great upper body work so you are working upper/lower at the same time.
TIP: to do the deadlifts properly place a weight plate or 1/2"" plank under the ball of your foot (just under the toes) and this will force your glutes to do all the work, not your back. If you don't want to put something under your toes, make sure all your weight is IN YOUR HEELS (like when doing a squat). If you learn to place weight on your heels rather than the ball of the foot you shift the emphasis into the glutes rather than lower back and quads.
After the standing work there is 18 mins of floor toning.  I love this part - and it is great for those who have bad knees. It is almost a pilates workout but does effectively tone.  I recommend newer exercisers just do this section after the warm-up then add the standing sculpting when this no longer leaves you sore.  Ends with a 5 min stretch.",1148256000,63,1273,4.2875
2353393,4,B000A2XC4Y,"This is a good workout and you do work up a sweat even though this isn't really cardio (I do this with 5 pound weights).  There is minimal jumping- only when switching directly from a left-leg lung to a right-leg lung so this would also be suited to people who want an effective workout but are uninterested in high-impact exercise.  I really like a lot of the exercises- particularly the 'bow and arrow'.  She has great exercises that you do feel quite quickly and there aren't loads of repetitions so this also keeps it intersting.  Most of the time I don't specifically feel the exercises in my butt though.  That is, I think this is more of a general workout, and not so much 'brand new butt'- the day after doing this I'm not particularly sore anywhere, but overall tired.  Janis Saffel has 'cute California charm'- some people like this, some don't.  Some things I don't like about this workout are a) the music includes elevator music of familiar songs- such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stevie Wonder; b) she shifts her angle a good bit and does several exercises in quick succession at times (warm up, etc.).  I find the and speed increases the risk of having poor alignment so I focus on keeping feet facing forward so the exercise is properly done- not rushed and poorly aligned.  I'm sure if you're familiar with these exercises this is not a problem; c) some floor stretches and ab work take the place of a cool down section.

Overall though, this is a good workout and one you can build on easily by increasing weights in your hands and adding weights on your ankles and waist.",1147564800,9,1591,4.531468531468532
2353394,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I am an advanced level home workout person and have narrowed my rotation to both of Minna Lessig's DVDs (Optimizer and Emergency Workout), the Denise Austin Personal Training DVD and Tamilee Webb Science of Fitness.  I really like a combination cardio and strenth workout and Janis Saffell really delivered!  She does an excellent job with her cues, she's not annoying at all, production is great, she explains the moves before doing it or changing to a new combo and has an effective number of reps.  Her approach is more functional fitness, which even for the more advanced, puts a different spin on the workout, gives you a good 60 minute sweat with some new muscle aches!  This is my new favorite addition to the rotation, highly recommended!",1127520000,48,746,4.850393700787402
2353423,3,B000A2XC4Y,"I think I expected more out of this workout.  I didn't really feel it was a ""workout"" and never really got my HR up.  I think this is more of a beginner level workout, and I was hoping it to be intermediate to advanced.  I will be selling this one.",1250208000,,248,3.92
2353424,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I'm sure this workout would be very tough for a beginner, but it's just right for an intermediate-level exerciser. You could also make it progressivley more challenging by adding heavier weights.
Janis seems like a very pleasant person. Not flashy, but sweet and funny. She seems like a friend taking you through the workout. If you prefer videos with trainers who motivate by being verbally abusive, this is not for you.",1241740800,,421,4.943661971830986

2353427,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I just received this DVD yesterday and tried it this morning. I was very pleased. The workout is challenging without being impossible and is enjoyable to do. It is definitely not a beginner workout. Janis does a great job cueing. As a fitness instructor myself, her teaching style is what I would aspire to imitate. I recommend this DVD.",1205884800,,337,4.728813559322034
2353428,5,B000A2XC4Y,"Ditto on all the positive reviews.  Just about every exercise works more than one muscle at a time, especially the core.  I would warn you off if you have a problem with your lower back, however.  Great workout for every muscle of your body.  Don't buy this expecting a cardio workout, but do expect excellent, unique exercises with very clear instructions and a variety of modifications.",1201564800,,388,4.833333333333333
2353429,5,B000A2XC4Y,"The emphisis of this video may be a brand new butt, but this is also a total body work out. Get ready to sweat! This is the toughest workout I've used and for that reason you have to be quite disciplined to keep it up- because it's just so much easier not to!

Since using this dvd I am definatly more toned, but without that stocky bulky muscle (makes a nice change for me). I would use more of her dvds in the future.

2353430,5,B000A2XC4Y,"This is the only Janis Saffell dvd I own and she is great. excellent controlled moves... great instructor in everyway, never annoying, great at cueing, great at motivating you, the moves are very exact and she gives great directions. She has an impressive physique. I am totally loving this DVD for the moves, the right pacing that is sometimes slow sometimes fast, always easy to follow, the camera always shows what she is doing...exceptional DVD. I was very sore after doing this work out.",1192233600,2,492,4.869047619047619
2353431,5,B000A2XC4Y,"This is a brilliant workout - the results are there and the instructor is great and you do get an all over workout too.  The exercises are unique - great variations on a classic sculpting move (like a plank move with a knee movement that will not only get your abs but your legs too).  You don't need a lot of repetition with this workout because the reps you do actually do are intense.
She is friendly and encouraging and to me, that is always helpful because if you aren't geared up for working out or really in the mood to carry on, an encouraging and motivating instructor can make all the difference and give you the boost you need to keep going.  I really enjoy this (and you will be sore for a day or two later) and recommend you give it a go.",1183766400,6,751,4.165517241379311
2353432,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I love this DVD.  Everytime I'm done, I'm sore for a few days after, which makes me feel like I really did workout my butt.  Also, I can never finish the whole DVD because it is just that intense.",1176940800,7,196,4.0

2353464,5,B000A2XC4Y,"Janis is very upbeat, the dvd began with a few steps a little hard to get at first but once you get going time flies!  Great, intense workout with moves I've never even seen before, I am anticipating bikini-ready legs and buns very soon!",1171929600,4,237,4.386363636363637
2353465,4,B000A2XC4Y,"I like this DVD so far. It is a good workout. The only problem is, this DVD has a price tag from 'ROSS', the discount store. Price at $4.99. But I bought it from Amazon for more than $6?? I will keep this DVD but I guess I will shop at ROSS more.",1169424000,4,246,3.660377358490566
2353466,5,B000A2XC4Y,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this workout does more than just work your backside.  Although the emphasis is certainly on the legs and glutes (and there are definitely a lot of dead lifts), you'll also work your back, chest, biceps, and triceps. Adding ankle weights and using handweights also really increases the intensity of this workout.  Your heartrate does go up while doing the exercises, but it's more of a toning and strength workout than a cardio workout. That being said, it's a great workout!  I consider myself to be an intermediate-level exerciser, and this one really challenges me and I can feel it the next day.

Another commendable aspect of the DVD is Janis herself. While one reviewer called her annoying, I don't think she is at all.  She's upbeat and positive, and not overly chatty, as some other instructors can be.  What I especially love is her focus on form and proper technique; she spends a few seconds before doing each exercise making sure that your body is properly aligned so that you are doing each exercise correctly.  While doing the exercises, Janis also points out exactly where you should be feeling each one, another great way to make sure that you're doing the exercise as it should be done.

This is one workout that gets results!  Highly recommended!",1168214400,12,1298,4.83710407239819
2353467,4,B000A2XC4Y,"I have tried everything under the sun to get rid of my ample rear on my otherwise petite figure. Nothing worked until now. My husband is complimenting me ALL the time and I find myself looking in the mirror more often and actually liking what I see! There is more lift and muscle in my buns.

The workout was really tough the first few times, but now that I know the exercises, I'm adding weight and really working hard.

The only drawback of the video is that Janis is extremely annoying and ditzy. But, looking beyond that, it's a wonderful workout!",1167436800,8,551,4.445544554455446
2353468,3,B000A2XC4Y,"This is an entire body workout that concentrates on the butt.  It works the butt from a variety of angles, so it is very thorough.  If you have trouble with your lower back, be cautious about this one.  It has a lot of military dead-lifts.  That many dead lifts is hard on my back.  If you've had problems with military dead lifts in the past, you probably don't want to get this item.",1165104000,15,385,4.219178082191781
2353469,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I continue to get Janis Saffell's exercise DVDs because first of all she's lovely to watch, has a beautiful, soothing voice, and has a nice personality.  Some of the exercises are confusing to do and I alternated them with what I think I should be doing, but overall they are effective and not all of them you have to do many reps!  I challenge myself with leg weights just because Miss Saffell suggests them.",1161907200,4,409,4.513513513513513
2353470,5,B000A2XC4Y,"Janis is one of my favorite home fitness instructors. She's very personable, has a fantastic body (and great form) and comes up with fun and effective DVDs. This DVD is no different.

This DVD suggests use of light handweights, ankle weights or a belt weight. None are absolutely required but none of the crew show modifications without weights. You won't need too much room to do this one, I have a 5 by 10 foot mat and used about 3/4 of it for this workout. You should be able to take 3 big steps to the side and 1 big step forward and back.

This DVD starts with a short 7 minute warm up that includes some functional squats and step touches and minimal stretching. After this you'll grab your handweights/belt/ankle weights and do a 30 minute standing floor routine with lots of squats, lunges and dead lifts. It is very different from the traditional bun work you may be used to. There are very few regular bun moves done and when they are they tend to be modified. There is also some light upper body work thrown in to increase intensity. After the standing work you'll move to the floor for 18 minutes of buns and ab work but you'll also work your arms and chest with some of the core work. Afterwards there is a 5 minute stretch with some more ab work. The strech isn't particularily effective after all the leg and bun work done here so you'll probably want to stretch some more (if you have any energy left!).

Your legs, hips and buns will be screaming during parts of this workout but I have found that I'm really not that sore, just fatigued, afterwards.

Overall this is a great lower body workout with the added bonus of upper and core body work. You'll be covered in sweat but feel fantastic at the end. After a few workouts you'll notice some improvement in the lower body:)",1152403200,26,1791,4.418181818181818
2353471,5,B000A2XC4Y,"This is definitely a great overall workout - I mean, I even felt my lower arm muscles after a couple of the functional abs exercises in the floor part of the program.

There are two great pros to this DVD. One of them is the kind of exercises that I hadn't seen on any home workout DVD's before I purchased this one. The other one is the way she combines well-known (and - admit it - sometimes real boring) old favorites to end up with the sweating exerciser (and by sweating exerciser I mean ME) actually enjoying them again. You will love these if you don't only do home workout programs just to clear your conscience, but you want to feel like you have done serious work for your body. (Okay, it helps if you enjoy the pain that often comes with it, I literally screetched my teeth when doing this workout the first few times.)

Trying to avoid just repeating what the other reviewers have already said (which I couldn't agree more with), I'll just say that the only con I found was the fact that the standing routine, which uses hand weights, is too fast to let you change weights, so you'll end up using the same ones for your biceps and triceps, for example, which is - for most of us - either too light or too heavy. Also, ankle weights would be real useful with some of the standing exercises, but I don't seem to be able to bend my ankles at the right angle when doing things like squats and plies with them on and I keep wondering how some of the background exercisers are able to do that. (Again, the routine is too fast for one to be able to keep putting ankle weights on and then taking them off.) Talking about background exercisers, there are five of them, they differ in ages and body types. Janis herself is kinda chatty (she keeps talking even when I'm at the stage of being unable to breathe at all), but not annoying - well, not extremely.

And well, she has put together a great workout for us, which she definitely deserves 5 stars for.",1152144000,7,1958,4.315217391304348
2353472,5,B000A2XC4Y,"I am so pleased with this workout, it is a refreshing change from the lunge and squat approach that pervades so many lower body workouts. There are some great effective new moves that I haven't found in my somewhat extensive workout collection. The cardio was stimulating and easy to follow (I can get lost pretty easily)- Janis does a great job of leading you through. I prefer smooth dance oriented exercise versus jarring high-impact and this delivers. It really takes your whole body through a balanced journey--I appreciate that Janis does some upper body work which I'm told is often wrongly neglected when people are focused on exercising this target area. I have Janis' original ""BNB"" and had always thought it was fairly good, but not great. This one pretty much wows me. I'm surprised this dvd has so few reviews- I've seen the gamut and this made me feel really fantastic.",1149984000,9,883,4.815789473684211

8073149,5,B000A2XC4Y,"No kidding around here, This is a serious work out that will get you results. Don't be fooled by the relatively easy warm-up (which is, after all, a warm-up). I consider myself to be an avid at-home exerciser and former gym rat, and there were definitely some exercises that I had not seen anywhere else before. And it definitely made me sore when I started out!

I agree with another reviewer that the title of this DVD could have been better chosen. It does focus on glutes, but also involves a lot of core and lower body. For good measure she also throws in some upper body such as triceps and lats. As a matter of fact, the standing sculpt part requires a great deal of core strength and balance (a lot of balancing on one leg involved), so If you are a beginning exerciser you may want to skip ahead and do the floor work until you built up more strength. When I started using this DVD, I did it without the added ankle weights and it was challenging enough. Adding the ankle weights brings it to a whole other level though.",1392163200,,1029,4.331606217616581
8073150,2,B000A2XC4Y,"I am a huge fan of Janis Saffell's kickboxing videos, partly because she introduces new moves gradually before speeding up the pace.  I thought I'd give her step workout a try.  I was in for a surprise...in this video, she introduces new moves very very quickly before incorporating them into the dance.  I'm no expert at dancing or following choreography, but this seemed to me a little extreme compared to other workout dance videos I have seen.  I was also disappointed that it had less of a focus on aerobic exercise and concentrated mostly on the aesthetic appeal of the dance moves.",1372636800,4,588,4.735294117647059

HOWEVER, I woke up the next morning and hurt in muscle areas I didn't realized I worked that hard.  I kept it and am trying to master it.  It looks easy, not that many repetitions, but it works all of your body - arms, shoulders, glutes!!, stomach/core.  Fantastic workout.",1368316800,,365,4.323529411764706
8073152,4,B000A2XC4Y,"I consider myself in the intermediate level of fitness category.

I really like Janis' kickbox workout but I wasn't too sure about this one after seeing clips online.  It looked a little too slow for me since I prefer either pilates or more frenetic cardio workouts.

While you could add additional weights to any workout, it is sometimes tricky because if the moves are too quick/erratic, they don't lend well to heavy weights e.g., doing jumping jacks and quick punches and kicks with weights.  I tend to think this is a bad idea, actually, because if you don't slow it down a bit you could hurt your elbows/knees with the added weight and quick movement.

Very wisely, they made this video with that intention since they show people with no weights and varying degrees of added weights.  I added ankle weights and used my heavy dumbbells and by the end, I was dripping with sweat.  The main routine is the standing one which has simple, clean moves that are easy to follow and some stability moves.  Also, there is a shorter mat section that, with weights, was a killer.  I think some people might be bored by the simplicity and less glossy production quality but overall this worked for me.",1287532800,4,1194,4.647619047619048
8073153,4,B000A2XC4Y,"I really enjoy Janis Saffell's stuff--I have two other DVDs of hers in addition to this one. She's encouraging and motivating, without being annoying (like Denise Austin).

In this workout, the focus is the butt, and boy, does she focus. There's some arm work with weights, and you'll do push-ups in the floor work, but there are also a LOT of lunges and plie' squats--you have the option of using ankle weights or a weight belt, and these really add intensity. There are also quite a few dead lifts; these do nothing for me, and I usually do something else or skip this part. I like the arm work she does later on in the standing segment; especially the ones that work my shoulders and triceps.

I REALLY like the floor work portion of this workout. The leg lifts that she starts with aren't my favorite (like the dead lifts, they really don't seem to be that effective for me), but the slow, controlled push-ups she leads you through are good--I see and feel results in my triceps and shoulders. The bow-and-arrow leg lifts and others are most effective, also--you WILL be sore the next day, especially if you're brave enough to keep the ankle weights on.

I usually skip the abs at the end, but you can keep the weights on or take them off to do leg lifts on your back (concentrating on lower abs), and to stretch.

I finish this workout sweating, panting, worn out--and feeling great. I've seen results from this workout, and I've gotten better at it as I've done it--though by no means does it lose its challenge with repetition.

If you're intermediate to advanced in your fitness journey, and want something fun and challenging, I highly recommend this.",1263340800,3,1660,4.613559322033899

I can come back to this DVD all the time except that I find it hard.  Its def. intermediate or higher.  It definitely does what the title says but a lot more too.  The set is okay, but mainly the variety of exercises is good.  Its not overly complicated or dancy.  I quite enjoy this workout.  However, I am not crazy about the floor workout section toward the end.  At the end of the day, I find something missing if I don't do this workout at least once in a couple of weeks.",1250640000,,638,4.155737704918033
