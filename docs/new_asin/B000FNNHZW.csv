8124827,4,B000FNNHZW,"Robert Lindsey is Jericho, a British police officer. Robert Lindsey is a real pro who gets the most out of every part he plays. That is what makes this PBS show worth watching. Unfortunately, the scripts are not up to his class. They are more confused than complicated,  they offer little for Lindsey (and his fellow-actors) to show their class. This one concerns the murder of a Black man and the kidnapping of a wealthy man. Lindsey's character has just been lauded by the Press for his previous endeavors; these two cases seem to be on their way to shattering that public reputation. Pretty routine material with some good actors keeping it watchable  I enjoyed the show despite my reservations because of the star and the London setting.  Its worth giving a try....but not at full retail prices. (You get two 45 minute episodes which comprise the entire story; it is also included in a two story collection available for purchase.)",1393459200,3,935,4.795031055900621
