1340978,2,B00004LC7U,"This film, obviously based upon Ayn Rand's book of the same name, is an extreme disappointment.
It might be worth [something], but nowhere near [what]I paid for it.
It leaves out almost everything that made the book a vivid portrait of extreme hardship and poverty.",1042070400,6,265,4.911111111111111
1340979,5,B00004LC7U,"This black and white version of Ayn Rand's 1936 novel is even more faithful to her work than Rand's own screenplay to Warner's 1949 'The Fountainhead.'  This film can get talky at times, the snow in the Rome studios is obviously fake and the plot is sort of soap-operatic.  That said, this movie is a rare treat to me, who fell in love with Valli when I saw her in 'The Third Man.'  She's even more beautiful here, and has a complex lead role to boot.  Her acting reminds me a lot of Ingrid Bergman's, and it is no wonder Selznick brought her to America after the war.  Fosco Giachetti plays Andrei Taganov, and his steely resolve holds the tension throughout.  The soundtrack, by Renzo Rossellini, is beautiful 1940s bombastic movie music, and lifts from Verdi and Puccini the way that Max Steiner and Alfred Newman borrowed generously from Wagner and Richard Strauss.  Remember Rossano Brazzi from 'South Pacific'?  He plays Leo Kovalensky, but is much younger and his baby-face makes it hard to take him seriously at times, but I believe it's because I can't shake my memories of him being much older in 'South Pacific.'",1017014400,15,1123,4.66497461928934
1340980,1,B00004LC7U,"This movie is an underrated charmer & a hell of a lot more interesting than the mediocre novel it was based on (Rand was much better at writing razor-sharp, non-fiction essays). No one can do melodrama as well as the Italians of the pre-neo-realist period, with their operatic traditions and passionate sounding language colliding with the harsh realities of the war period and Mussollini fascism.
Here Italians get to play some unrealistic Russians, but they do it with so much conviction and passion, you don't care one bit! The message of Rand's anti-tyranny novel comes across beautifully through the cumulative force of the situations, the dramatic dialogue, and the elegant dramatic gestures used by Alida Valli, Rossano Brazzi, Fosco Grachietti and the rest of the superb cast, in showing you realistic internalizations of the many conflicts raging in people as a result of those historically based situations. The Italian actors of this period maintain a charming balance between utter naturalism and passionate going 'over-the-topisms'. The camera movements, style, and mythic distance of the film are also very impressive, not afraid to use the dreamy aspects of the cinematic illusion to full effect. As a further bonus, Renzo Rossellini's super-busy but always understated music adds that touch of surrealism & romantic existentialism that he would become famous for later in Roberto Rossellini's masterworks.
One of the reasons it probably works as well as it does is because it was made right on the brink of the neo-realist revolution without the knowledge of Rand herself, who might have unwittingly stifled its more poetic and crazy aspects in favor of more 'philosophy' had she been involved. She loved it later, some forty years later, when she discovered a print (Mussolini's government had confiscated all prints and the negative), which shows her good judgment after the fact, and that, some remanants of a true artist and a philosopher were still left in her, even when the Objectivist movement itself had turned into a cult.",1003104000,12,2048,5.209090909090909
1340981,4,B00004LC7U,"Hollywood has never done Rand justice. Gary Cooper was a wooden Howard Roark in King Vidor's ""The Fountainhead"", and Rand's own adapted screenplay left viewers scratching their heads about her ""message"". The recent ""Passion of Ayn Rand"" is just a cheap ad hominum attack. This film breathes life into her work. The actors are physically perfect, passionate instead of talky. Alida Valli is gorgeous in the lead role. The smokey black and white is perfect for 1917 Russia, and the production quality rivals Hollywood's best for that era. It's hard to believe this film was essentially a bootleg, made witout the authorization or cooperation of the book's author.

1340983,4,B00004LC7U,"By far, this is the best adaptation of a book I've ever seen.  After the disappointments from ""The Fountainhead"" and the ""Atlas Shrugged"" trilogy, ""We the Living"" was remarkably close to the book.  Of course, the movie is never as thorough as the novel, but this is close enough to perfect and the acting is fantastic; not histrionic as with many Hollywood movies of the era.

POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT: The only surprise/disappointment was that the movie ends rather abruptly.  Kira is shown packing for her escape, with her white dress laid out on her bed and Leo ends their relationship.  The movie ends in her bedroom.",1462233600,,620,4.811320754716981

1341006,5,B00004LC7U,"This movie was done in Italy during Mussolini's time in power as a show of protest to the abuse of power. When the Italian government finally realized they banned the film. It follows Ayn Rand's book closely. The story, the closest thing to an autobiography she ever wrote, is set in Russia just after the Bolshevik revolution. It lets a person see what Russia was like then through the eyes of someone who was actually there.",1398729600,3,426,4.618421052631579
1341007,1,B00004LC7U,"Alessandrini was certainly a skilful movie director and ""We the Living"" in the original version shows his metier. But there is no inspiration behind and to line up sometimes beautiful sequences isn't enough. The plot is conventional, the description of the first years in Soviet Russia embarrassing banal. Alida Valli's acting is uneven, sometimes unconvincing and all in all not at the level of such a great actress. Ayn Rand's version, in which some important sequences and one subplot are cut out hasn't improved the original film: the movie appears even less inspired and conventional then ever. Historically the movie is important as a document of the fascist film industry and, what Ayn Rand's version concerns,as a document of the Cold War. Slavoj Zizek's endorsement of the movie appears to me as a sort of joke, a sarcastic one.",1396828800,2,837,5.028776978417266

1341011,5,B00004LC7U,"This is one of the most awesome love stories I've ever watched.

I don't agree with everything Ayn Rand says, but this is a much better love story than Atlas Shrugged.

It comes as a 2-disc set, but the whole 4-hour movie is on one disc.

The movie is about the corruption, and the crushing of the individual spirit that occurs in the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution.  The heroine, Kira, wants no part of communism, but she's a captive in the Soviet Union.  She is torn between two men, Andrei, a highly idealistic, decent, principled secret policeman, and Leo, a much less idealistic or principled former aristocrat.

Andrei: ""You approve of my ideals, but not my methods."".
Kira: ""No, I loathe your ideals."".

The movie is in Italian, with English subtitles.  It was made in 1942 by the Mussolini regime, which liked it because it was criticizing communism, but they didn't understand the movie was really criticizing totalitarianism and promoting individualism and freedom.",1392681600,5,982,4.945121951219512

1341013,1,B00004LC7U,"Full disclosure ... I am not a fan of old movies, and while I respect much of Ayn Rands work, this movie is a complete bore; perhaps because all but the very, very naive know that communism can't work and hasn't worked no matter how often it's been tried.  The characters are bores, the music was simplistic, Ayn Rands writing IMHO has always been horrible (but she makes compelling points).  The cinematography horrible!  Costumes were great, some settings were good. The subtitles are in white, and since there is much snow and many tablecloths you can't read white on white.  However, you pick up enough words that you will understand the storyline.

There are plenty of documentaries you can watch (Korea) if you need to learn how awful communism is.  I am sorry I paid for this movie and will give it away at the first opportunity.  If your libertarian friends are pressuring you to watch this movie, do it on their dime, not yours.  I suspect the 5 star reviews are by those who are AR fans and under no circumstances would they dare knock her.  I am a strong Conservative who agrees with much of ARs philosophy but not all.  If this were my only introduction into ARs philosophy, I doubt I'd pursue any more of it.

1341017,4,B00004LC7U,"Having read the book, the ending that the movie took was just not right. It has more impact for the main character to be shot by Tyrannical Russian Communists trying to escape the oppression than to just submit to the situation. She was supposed to be a much stronger person in the book. The movie itself is dated but good even though you have to read the subtitles very fast to keep up. I wish they would of over dubbed in English. It's the standard love story combined with the strong message that Statist big Government control over every aspect of our lives never works for the people, it always oppresses them and it is a warning to be taken seriously as it is in Atlas Shrugged. As always the book has much more detail and development of characters than the movie. If you know the book you might want to watch the bonus disc first to see what the idea was behind cutting certain scenes and changing the ending, then watch the movie. I wish someone would remake this movie closer to the book but moved up to the 21st century from places that still practice Communism like North Korea, Cuba, Russia, etc. It would even be appropriate to come from other Fascistic places that dominate people's lives or you are dead like Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, etc. Ah but that might be a whole new book with the same general themes of love and oppression of individual Freedom by Governments - including what is happening to the USA now.

1341018,5,B00004LC7U,"It is thought that ""We the Living"" has autobiographical elements. If so, its tender story is a look into the soul of Ayn Rand. The story was beautifully adapted into a movie in Italy in 1942, then banned, and only years later rediscovered and restored. The lead character, Kira, is strong, and yet vulnerable. Kira's philosophy comes to be understood by her consort, Andrei, a communist, perhaps even more clearly than she knows it. Her husband, Leo, shows himself not a hero, but merely an ordinary man, a person who lives life superficially. But she loves Leo dearly, at least the image she has of him.

Set in Russia, it philosophically presents her ideas about the fatal blow to human nature that Communism represents. It is a dramatic story of Kira, who yearns for freedom, her lover Leo, who becomes ill with TB and needs money for institutionalized care, and the Communist leader who Kira pretends to love in order to get the money for Leo's cure.

1341027,5,B00004LC7U,"Full disclosure...I am a big Ayn Rand fan.  I had read We the Living and was curious about a film adaptation of the book.  This movie is long and in Italian with English subtitles, so I had some uncertainty about purchasing it.  At first I had some trouble getting established with the story, trying to watch the action while reading the subtitles, but after awhile, the movie just draws you in and you are fully engaged with the characters.  This movie is 174 minutes long.  Quite long by today's movie standards, but well worth the time spent watching.  PLUS, there is a bonus disc in the box that contains a wonderful extra video: ""We the Living, A Lost Treasure Recovered"" that details how the film was hidden away from Mussolini.  Mussolini had originally authorized this unauthorized version of the film (Ayn Rand had not authorized it) during the war to show how bad Communism was, but ironically, the people viewing it realized they had it just as bad under Fascism. Mussolini then banned the movie and tried to destroy all copies.  The original negatives were hidden away and Mussolini ended up destroying the negatives of another movie. The bonus video goes on to explain how the book had been made into two movies with lots of Mussolini propaganda and how they cut out the propaganda and put the film back together again as one movie that followed the main plot of the book.  I found it quite interesting.

My puny review does not do this movie justice.  I highly recommend it for Ayn Rand fans and future Ayn Rand fans.  Enjoy.",1342051200,4,1539,4.638376383763838

The only problem with the film is that the quality is not what we expect. It was not digitally remastered.  In some place the subtitles were hard to read against the background.  However, the acting is outstanding.  I read the book years ago and I can say that the casting was very well done and the book was followed well.  The sets were well done and believable. The use of Russians immigrant to Italy as extra (who had actually lived under communism) gave the scenes authenticity. Adding the scenes that Rand cut out as an extra feature made the film a better experience.

She is mistress to a man she loves, but is poor and weak.

Fimed in B&W, this 3 hour film is a romantic masterpiece about people who refuse to surrender the cours of their lives to the state.

1341034,4,B00004LC7U,"This film is the product of the re-cutting of two films made in Italy during WWII based on Ayn Rand's ""We the Living"".  The original films were made without Rand's knowledge and only made it past the fascist censors by inserting bits of propaganda, which starkly contrast with the anti-collectivist theme of the novel.  The original films were ordered destroyed after immense success in Italy, and only survived because the original print was hidden.  Years later the print was unearthed and this version (which removes items of propaganda and trims the subplots) was produced with Rand's oversight.

The final product is remarkably true to Rand's novel.  While a product of a more romanticized (and I do not use this term as a pejorative but to emphasize the difference in acting style) era of film-making, it is still accessible to a modern audience.  The three major characters are portrayed with passion and care.  Alida Valli is especially noteworthy as she beautifully captures the soul of Kira.

Unlike many film adaptations of books, it is not necessary to have read the novel to fully enjoy this film.  There is depth and heart behind the original works and this re-cutting only serves to clarify that fact.

I give this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the subtitling was difficult to read in portions of the film.  The included Special Features are also worth a look and provide a good deal of historical background.",1311465600,8,1430,4.8921161825726145

I have no words to describe the perfection of the actors in depicting these characters.  The story is so interesting and so challenging- its much more than just a condemnation of the Soviet system.  Films with this kind of philosophical resonance are very rare indeed.

The extras were wonderful and really added to the impact of the film.  The featurette about the history of ""We The Living"" had me floored.  Learning about the historical context of it moved me as much as the film itself.  The circumstances under which it was produced are shocking, and that we have any remnant at all to enjoy today is almost miraculous.

She had no part of this Italian version of her book, yet it captures the spirit of the book and the characters' desperation so well; it is scary in its precision and ability to stay concise.

Alida Valli did a wonderful job as Kira.  My favorite scene was in the university when the Communist were ""voting"".  Her contempt for the Communists was classic.  I loved it!!  Rand did an excellent job editing the film.

On a philiosophical level, the film shows the slow destruction of those who cherish their own lives.  Any dictatorship does this to those who are the most competent and independent.  The injustices Kira and Leo and their families endured are real.  My only concern was that some of the deleted scenes should have remained in the final cut.  Particularly Kira escaping Soviet Russia.  That should have stayed.

I just finished reading The Whispers by Orlando Figes.  That chronicles the life of ordinary citizens in Stalin's Russia.  Although the film captures life at the beginning of the Soviet Union, Rand did an extradinary job in detailing life there.  In essence, she told the truth.  I would hope that those who purchase this film will think about our own time and how easily bad ideas can destroy an entire country.",1267315200,9,1215,4.872549019607843
1341042,5,B00004LC7U,"Ironically produced under fascist Italy as an anti-communist film (though later banned), We The Living's far broader pro-individual and anti-statist theme shines through in this excellent film. This is epic movie making based on one of the lesser known and most autobiographical of Ayn Rand's books. We The Living depicts communist Russia as Ayn Rand remembers it but is also a good story about a love triangle between young Kira, who wants to be an engineer, teetering Leo, who once was an idealist but quickly decays into cynicism held only by his love and admiration for Kira, and secret police GPU officer Andrei, who loves Kira but believes the wrong ideals and has to learn this the hard way.

Needless to say, I love this film and am so pleased that Duncan Scott, the distributor, finally brought it out on DVD with all the scenes that were cut from the original films. My only regret is that anticipated sales of the DVD were obviously such that Mr. Scott wasn't able to invest the money to have the film restored before the DVD release, although the print we see is decent. The only other issue is that if I were Ayn Rand, I would have kept in the film appox. 13 minutes of scenes that were cut, as illustrated below (Please reference the deleted scenes on the DVD):
I would have kept:
#3, Andrei and Kira debate;
#6, Aunt Marussia falls ill segment;
#8, Expulsion from Institute
#9, Nica's death; and
#12, Wedding speach.
Theses scenes offer a power condemnation of Communism/Fascism, a superb denunciation of the toxic Soviet ideology: ""You build to destroy others. One day you will destroy yourselves!"", whereby only party members have access to health care and education.
I would also have kept:
#5, Mama visits Kira and Leo, which shows how much everyone still relies on Kira who was, nevertheless, rejected by her own family;
#10, Kira and Andrei at a cafe, which ties in with a scene at the beginning of the film where, travelling in the train, Kira hears beautiful music coming from another compartment. There, as in this scene, the music represents the powerful, limitless abilities of man--his ability to rise above the material necessities of food and shelter to dream, to be moved by emotion, to innovate, to create that which is intangible, yet beautiful and inspiring--all that which the communists feel wasteful and unnecessary; and especially
#19, the original ending, which finally shows what happens to the wedding dress that the prior scene focused on. I really don't know how this scene could have been removed for reasons of ""artistic integrity"" for it exactly matches the ending in the novel.
In any case, those are my quibbles. But overall, I obviously recommend this film very highly and think it richly deserves the five stars.",1255132800,114,2559,4.925925925925926
1341046,5,B00004LC7U,"A few things...

1) This is a ""lost"" classic that must be seen. Filmed and originally released in fascist Italy during WWII, it was eventually ordered destroyed by Mussolini...but cooler minds (those of the producers) prevailed and secreted a copy. It took four decades for this movie to get ""unveiled"" again.

2) It stars Valli, who would 8-9 years later go on to star with Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles in the classic ""The Third Man."" She's beautiful and phenomenal!

3) Until now, this movie was only available on VHS and the old laser discs. I bought it on laser disc back in the early 1990s, and have been waiting for a DVD release for years. And it's been worth the wait!

The extras are cool...all new. A 35-minute documentary on the movie, its post-war discovery, and its re-release. Then about 45 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which were cut out during preparation for the film's revival in the 1980s and made under Ayn Rand's supervision. It's very nice to see these.

The only disappointment came when the movie finished without the ending  from the novel. If the original film was lost then it is forgivable. If not, I don't understand the deletion.

Beware! The film is intended to be a true depiction of life in a slave state where no one can be trusted. Ayn Rand saw it and lived it herself. She knew the importance of sharing the experience with those who never lived with these conditions. The right to choose one's own destiny led her to depart Russia and come here.",1231891200,3,793,4.455172413793103
1341049,4,B00004LC7U,"I remember finding a copy of this film, and I really liked it.  Its history is as fascinating as the film itself.  For those who don't know, this is an unauthorized version of Ayn Rand's novel We The Living.  It was made in 1942 under Mussolini's rule.  It had the full approval of the government, at least when it was being made.  When the film was shown to the censor boards, it was banned.  But somehow Mussolini saw it himself, and he loved it, so it was approved and was shown around Italy.  But then Mussolini reversed himself, because the film was as much anti-authoritarian as it was anti-Communist.  It disappeared for decades, but eventually it was rediscovered, and even Ayn Rand loved the film (and she wasn't easy to please).

The film is remarkable in that it makes Rand's characters believable and they come across as real people.  Rand's characters in her novel usually pontificate on soapboxes about the ideal of capitalism, the evil of collectivism, etc., etc..  There is a little of that here, and it's pretty muted compared to the later film version of The Fountainhead.  It also gives hope that Rand's novels (there aren't many of them) can actually be made into good movies.  The Fountainhead is a particularly bad film, and Atlas Shrugged hasn't seen the light of day for nearly 50 years (and is still in the dark hell of development).  I'm glad Rand ultimately gave her blessing to this film, and that it survived all those years.",1195344000,8,1454,4.673228346456693

As one character lectures another herein: ""why do you think you are entitled to your own thoughts...against those of the majority of the Collective?""  After all, as a Bolshevik explains, ""...no external enemy...is as dangerous to us as the internal enemy of dissension within our own ranks.  On the jacket of the book on which this film is based appears the following: ""We the Living demonstrates the supreme value of a human life and the evil of those who claim the right to sacrifice it.""  There's your life.  You begin it feeling that it's something so precious & rare, so beautiful that it's like a sacred treasure.""  But ""one man means nothing in the face of the mighty Proletarian Collective,"" the Bolsheviks counter.  In such an environment, Kira, the heroine of this film (based on a 1936 novel by Ayn Rand) subsequently concludes: ""Nothing matters. We mustn't think. We mustn't think at all.""  To a Bolshevik she charges, ""you came and forbade life [as in freedom of choice] to the living."" ""You took their every hour, every minute, every nerve, every thought in the farthest corners of their souls---and you told them what it had to be;"" ""telling men ""what they must live for.""  This after we see how a number of characters lose their jobs, or get thrown out of university ""for trying to think"" for themselves.  This is life in the Soviet Union as personally experienced by Ayn Rand (a nom de plume the Russian author invented to protect family members still living in Leningrad at the time). She saw firsthand how Bolshevism went about putting down new rules, fashioning a state that took ""your honor, your life and your freedom."" And while this isn't Ms. Rand's life story, it is, as the author states in the introduction of her novel, a sort of autobiography, in the intellectual sense; having instilled Kira with the author's ""ideas, her convictions, her values."" And while the ""plot is invented,"" Ms. Rand admits, ""the background is not.""  And the ""Sovietness"" of said background is not the paramount issue herein either, but the notion that, notwithstanding any utopian rhetoric, ""you cannot enslave man's mind.  ""You can only destroy it.""  In a collectivist society, ""what are your masses but millions of dull, shrivelled, stagnant souls that have no thoughts of their own, no dreams of their own, no will of their own.""  This film based (faithfully for the most part) on Ms. Rand's work is, in short, a powerfully written expose of collectivist mentalities; a warning that ""you cannot castigate life ""in order to perpetuate it."" Do make an effort to see it.  It's a very effective film. (06May) Cheers!",1148860800,10,2714,4.818965517241379
1341051,5,B00004LC7U,"Goffredo Alessandrini's unauthorized 1942 version of Ayn Rand's novel ""We the Living"" appeared in Fascist Italy in two separate parts: NOI VIVI and ADDIO, KIRA. They are essentially one film. It was the grim story of post-revolutionary Russia, the forced collectivization of the economy and the brutal suppression of human rights, all told from the viewpoint of one woman, Kira. Ayn Rand's novel was autobiographical and was essentially a diatribe against the loss of individuality in totalitarian societies.

The film attracted a sizable audience in Italy. The Fascist government saw the film(s) as a condemnation of Soviet misery but when it became aware that the movie(s) implied a condemnation of all totalitarian states, left and right, it withdrew them from distribution.

They were not seen again and were thought lost until the early 1960s when Ayn Rand's attorneys located prints in Rome. Ayn Rand liked the movie(s) a great deal, while having reservations about certain liberties that had been taken with dialog and situations. She died in 1982 and did not live to see the re-issue of the film, which was brought about under the auspices of the Ayn Rand estate. The original two-part 4-hour version was edited down to a 170-minute one-film version. One major speech (of Fosco Giachetti) was redubbed to assert Randian philosophy, and the ending (with the death of Kira in the snow as she is shot trying to escape from Russian) was eliminated, rendering the film more optimistic.

We are glad that the film was made available in some form after having been lost for decades. After all, how many films from Fascist Italy get picked up for commercial distribution in America these days? But we also regret that Alessandrini's complete artistic achievement was truncated and tampered with. Wasn't creative integrity the theme of Rand's novel ""The Fountainhead""?

Having had the good fortune of seeing the uncut integral two films on video in Italy, I can vouch for them as being more satisfying, less disjointed in that format. Let's be clear. This new version is NOT a ""restoration"" as some are calling it. It is, rather, an ""adaptation."" We are ambivalent about it but pleased to have it. And the 35mm print material is first rate.

As much as anything else, WE THE LIVING is a whopping good love story, of ""Camille""-like intensity and ""Anna Karenina""-like grandeur. The stunning Alida Valli as Kira and Rossano Brazzi as her wastrel lover Leo, devour the screen in their scenes together. Fosco Giachetti as Andrei, head of the secret police and willing to sacrifice honor and ideals for Kira, is poignant and unforgettable. As is this film, or as are these films.",1105920000,31,2672,5.009009009009009
1341052,5,B00004LC7U,"This movie was originally released in Italy in two parts. ""Noi Vivi"" (""We're Alive"") and ""Adio Kira"" (""Farewell Kira""). Set in post-revolutionary Russia, this film was originally encouraged for production by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini because he thought it was of an anti-communist nature.

Mussolini later banned it because of the film's anti-totalitarian/pro-individual rights message. I would like to think that this movie helped plant the seeds that lead to Mussolini's downfall and I believe Ayn Rand saw ""We The Living"" too before she died and she loved it.

My family on my dad's side lived in Italy when Mussolini was dictator and I am involved in the libertarian and Objectivist movements so I appreciate this movie from three perspectives.

While I wish the movie wasn't so long and expensive to purchase, I think, all-in-all, it is the best foreign film ever made!

Everything else about this film is wonderful and belongs in any serious movie goer's collection. I hope at some point a DVD version of this movie can be done too. If more of films like this interest you, in addition to ""The Fountainhead"", I also recommend ""Herod's Law"", ""Bitter Sugar"", ""Guantanamera"", ""The Official Story"", ""Farewell My Concubine"" and last (but certainly not least) ""Life Is Beautiful"".
