7953654,4,B00005TNWU,"One of 10 Petra Kolber workouts I own; this one is a good all-round step workout but the choreography can be a bit challenging at times.
A 48 minute tape, including an 8 minute warm-up combination, 32 minutes of stepping (3 different 64-count combinations), and an 8-minute cool-down and stretch.
If you're new to stepping you may find yourself frustrated, if you're an experienced stepper you'll likely find her combinations interesting.",1423008000,,438,5.183098591549296
