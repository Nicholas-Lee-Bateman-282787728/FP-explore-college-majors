7881024,4,6305039399,"GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY is simply one of the best Documentary Series ever made. Produced between 1992 and 1996, and originally broadcast on BBC2, this fascinating series examines some of the greatest criminal cases in history. Bizarre Deaths, Unsolved Murders, Serial Killers, Legendary Trials, War Criminals, Gangsters, Kidnapping Cases, and more are profiled in these fascinating episodes. Solely making use of archive footage, stills and interviews, GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY was produced in an era when ""true crime"" television was dominated by dramatised reconstructions, a genre that became popular in the 1980s. Everything about this series is great: the many different cases covered, the narration, the information given to us, the special ""atmosphere"" created by the music and the voice of the narrator... This is a wonderful series and I highly recommend it to anybody having an interest for True Crime, murder cases and Real life mysteries. Enjoy !

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: Judge Peel & Donald Hume. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: Judge Peel
Joseph Alexander Peel was born in West Palm Beach and was married with two children. He became a lawyer in 1949 and three years later was named the city's only municipal judge. On 14th June 1955, Peel ordered a man to kill Judge Curtis E Chillingworth and his wife Marjorie. On 30th March 1961, jurors took five hours and 24 minutes to find Peel guilty of accessory to murder. The prosecutor wanted the death penalty, but the jury recommended mercy and Peel was sentenced to two life terms.

Episode 2: Donald Hume
Donald Hume first captured the attention of the crime-loving British public in 1949 when he took off in a rented airplane and dropped three packages into the Thames estuary. The packages contained, respectively, the head, legs and torso of a used-car dealer named Stanley Setty, who had quarreled with Hume.",1351036800,,1940,5.037383177570093
7881025,3,6305039399,"I love forensics and this is a good video. It is more like watching a TV documentary, which it probably was originally, than a movie. I was a little taken aback, since I generally expect a video to be more or less the duration of a full-length movie, and this video was over before I was quite ready. Other than that, it was well done and I enjoyed it.",1044316800,4,352,4.115942028985507
