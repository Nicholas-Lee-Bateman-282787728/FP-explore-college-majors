Go for it!",1126224000,11,367,4.75
2405810,5,B000B7QCHC,"This is the last collection of the animated Batman shows (unless you count the Batman Beyond, the Justice League show, or the new series simply called ""The Batman"", none of which have seen boxed set form.)

Jumping ahead a few years from the original ""Batman: The Animated Series"", this set of episodes also covered the period of time when the show jumped from airing on Fox networks to the WB network. It's often called ""The New Batman Adventures"" or ""Batman: Gotham Knights"".

Darker and grittier than previous incarnations, these are the episodes that show a young Dick Grayson growing into the new hero Nightwing. Batgirl becoming a hero in her own right, and Batman gaining a new Robin in the form of Timothy Drake.

2405860,5,B000B7QCHC,"A lot of people say this season isn't as good because they changed the animation style but that is really just preference. The original style was reflective of the old Max Fleischer Superman serials. This is more true to Bruce Tim's style that went on to be used throughout Superman, Batman Beyond and the justice league. A great season with some very memorable episodes. A must for any Batman/DC fan.",1500336000,,401,4.742857142857143
2405871,2,B000B7QCHC,"It's cool to have a bunch of One off, villain of the week episodes but I can see why this season wasn't picked up for another one. I hated the changes to the costumes of Joker and Catwoman. It's a cheap and ugly look and very annoying considering their first looks (in the first 3 volumes) was spot on. Also, I feel like there's a lot of back story missing.

During the previous volumes, We still had the villain of the week formula but we got the origin story, breaking out of Arkham for another scheme and so on so forth. With this we are just thrown into villain after villain and it just got stale. I'd rather they focus on the same villains and rotate them than have a dozen plus appear and disappear for the rest of the season. Also, I am disappointed that none of the Batman team got a real story this volume. There was one episode for Tim Drake to explain how he became the new Robin and one to explain why Dick Grayson left and became Nightwing, That was it. The biggest miss of the season is the fact that they pretty much ignored the Bruce/Dick team break up when it could have been the total story arc for the season.

I'm also not a fan of the fact that it was pretty much all Batman all season. At least with previous volumes, Everyone had a chance to shine. From Batgirl to Robin, Everyone had a shot and it wasn't all on Batman to carry the show. That's what made the previous volumes so good, It was a team effort with a good supporting story to it. This volume goes to show that unless you put in the effort story wise, The end product is still gonna fail in comparison to past works.",1499472000,,1602,4.181229773462783

Not to mention two episodes (The Ultimate Thrill & Legends of the Dark Knight) storyboarded by my favorite artist of all-time, Darwyn Cooke. RIP Dar!",1492128000,2,501,4.704545454545454

Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne really sells this series as a whole. He is truly the Batman and the writers on this series do not do any revamps on Batman like the later series would...they give you a Batman series that pulls from his golden age all the way to the present day.

There is much interaction with the new Robin, Tim Drake, as well as with Batgirl...and there is one story that features both Bruce/Dick and Batman/Nightwing-just wish there had been more.  But the stories in this volume are still strong--the origin of Harley Quinn, and the 'death' of Batgirl--are definitely worth purchasing this remaining volume.  I still would choose this volume last in terms of preference, but is still worth getting in order to complete a collection of animated stories, or 'mini movies' as mentioned in the extras in Volume 1, that changed the perception of a animated super hero cartoon show.",1482796800,,850,4.971830985915493

I'm no prude, and I love DC, but this series needs to be rated more for tweens and comic book fans rather than ""family"" TV.  I get that the original series is dark, it just needs to have a different rating so parents don't pop on a little Batman for their 5 year old and then have to address the questions surrounding gangs, murdered parents, and gun-smuggling while sporting overly wide eyes wondering what happened while you ran the vacuum during a little screen time.",1481846400,,647,4.675438596491228

As well as offering good portrayals of the classic characters, it even introduced worthy new ones such as Harley Quinn! My only ding is that the streaming versions omit Kevin Conroy's ""I am vengeance, I am the Knight!"" From the opening credits.

2406068,3,B000B7QCHC,"You can not go on anything Batman related without at least seeing this series being referenced to at least once and so I decided to check it out and after watching this series I can see why, I loved seasons 1, 2, and 3 (I'm a little confused on how many seasons this show had because on some websites it says 2 + this season and on others 3 + this season which is also known as the new Batman adventures and there was also that time when the 3rd season was renamed the adventures of Batman and robin but then went back to being called Batman the animated series and its just really confusing if I think about for too long) but I'm going with 4 since it says that on amazon and its easier that way, anyways this probably has to be my least favorite season, they took a lot of risks and I respect that but the end result wasn't that great I mean I didn't think it was horrible just a lot of episodes that had a lot of stuff that didn't work or the episode was just really weird like ""love is a croc""  ""torch song"" ""the ultimate thrill"" and ""critters"" but there were also a few good and decent episodes like ""old wounds"",  ""you scratch my back"", ""over the edge"" surprisingly really liked ""animal act"" (read the summary before watching the episode and thought it sounded silly) and ""holiday knights"" and a few more, really hated the new animation style but I understand why they changed it however most of the redesigns were awful especially joker and catwoman (though Selina looked fine when she wasn't in her costume) and dicks ugly mullet but it could have been a lot worse, also a lot more batgirl and the new robin, Tim drake which was a weird mix of Tim and Jason, and not much of nightwing which as a Dick Grayson fan finding out that Dick was only in about 7 episodes and seeing how...not great this season was compared to the others...it took me awhile to finish this season, also Barbara, to me at least didn't really fit in some of the episodes and kept asking myself why she appeared in more episodes then Tim, which didn't go away until I watched ""old wounds"" but your almost done with the series by the time you watch that episode, I could go on talking about why this season wasn't the best but what's the point in complaining about a cartoon that ended years ago. Also quick side note that really has nothing do with this but I can not believe that this season treated nightwing better then most Batman writers have treated him, also wish that they would have kept the song that they play during the closing credits when it was renamed the adventures of Batman and robin but had kept the original song for the opening that would have been great imo.",1475193600,,2661,4.330661322645291

2406076,4,B000B7QCHC,"The 4th and final season of BTAS (as presented on Amazon Prime Video) continues some great storytelling and character development. It is important to note that more so than in other seasons, some of the content is a little more violent, sexually suggestive, and generally more appropriate for teens and adults than for younger kids. Joker slapping Harley around is one example that comes to mind. The animation, while still very stylized and pretty to look at, isn't nearly as beautifully done or ""noir"" as the first 3 seasons. That the show went with a different animation company is very obvious. Why they chose to portray the Joker with black eyes I'll never understand.

This series also highlights how drastically our society has changed as this cartoon would never be approved in today's world with its feminine female characters and ultra-masculine male characters. Ironically, all female characters are prime role models for girls with demure and feminine PhDs and business magnates. Equality at its finest.

2406147,5,B000B7QCHC,"TAS season 4 stands out a bit with it's character design ""revamp"" and the cantankerous nature of Bruce Wayne even with his mask off. Bruce is a little less relatable but probably a bit more natural seeing as he's not acting the playboy from here on out. I like that this season focuses a lot on the supporting characters, particularly the Bat-family and a few of the more interesting villains. This season has a lot of tragedy with the villains, taking dark turns that leave the watcher feeling pity towards most villains. It would have been nice to have more of a book-end finale but the show runners probably expected another season or two.",1469491200,,642,4.640350877192983

2406172,4,B000B7QCHC,"First of all this is really ""The New Batman Adventures"", which is when it moved from FOX to WB. There is an art style shift to make it appear visually more like the Superman animated series since they were aired back to back on WB at the time.

Because of this, there are some some artwork changes most notably to the Joker, which looks horrible compared to Seasons 1-3. Penguin looks like an old man instead of Tim Burton's look, Scarecrow is just a dark face under a hat, instead of a..scarecrow. Ridler looks more like his classic 60's batman version, and Batman gets an updated batsuit (No more yellow emblem) and even Bruce Wayne gets an updated image.

That being said, its still the same great writing and creative force that made the first seasons so great, so still worth watching. Just looses a star for making the Joker more depressive looking and other silly redesigns that shouldn't have been done.",1466985600,,911,4.617283950617284

2406178,4,B000B7QCHC,"The art style shift has its moments of greatness but lacks when it comes to certain villain designs, particularly Penguin and Riddler. A few episodes are ridiculous, particularly the firefly episode, but there are some great moments such as batgirl's fear gas episode that shine. The season lacks the spark of the first two seasons and shows its considerably weaker notes from the format shift to The New Adventures of Batman and Robin, with the Nightwing and Catwoman episode being the highlight. The show does work great when the whole Bat-Family made appearances.

The highlight episode of the season though is Legends of The Dark Knight which mimics the art style of the Super Friends Batman and Robin, as well as having a glimpse into the Mutant Boss fight from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. It's balls nasty. Real slice-a dice-a.",1466467200,2,845,4.950704225352113

I think that one the last episodes is the what inspired one of the 6 stories from Batman:Gotham Knight. That episode is very stylized. They have a bunch of story twist but that only effects those specific episodes. I like the way alot of characters had started interactions with each other kinda immersing the Gotham social web. The season has some goofy and almost skipable parts but I watched it all had fun doing it.

2406264,3,B000B7QCHC,"This review is only for the 4th season. After watching Batman: TAS, highly considered as one of the best animated series of all time, this ""season"" is a cruel joke. While the animation style changed, most of the original voice actors remained. However, the writting was silly and beyond far-fetched, even for a superhero character. When Batman, still voice by the great Kevin Conroy, broke out in spiritistic chant, I nearly turned it off due to the pain of my eye rolling.

Watch it to complete the series but if you love TAS as I do, keep your expectations low.",1459209600,,563,4.63

2406276,3,B000B7QCHC,"Here we have the fourth and final season of Batman the Animated Series; although it really is the Batman episodes of what became the new Batman/Superman Adventures (as it air on the WB network years ago).
Of the four volumes, to me this is the weakest. That's not to say it isn't good, just for the most part not as good as the rest.
This volume, we find that Batman has expanded his team beyond just occasionally Robin: Dick Grayson has become Nightwing, Barbara Gordan has officially been initiated into the team, and a new younger Robin (Tim Drake) has joined the cause. These characters take up more screen time than they would have previously, as the show is a little more team based, which I don't have so much a problem with.
However, I don't care for the character changes to Batman himself. He seems a little more harsher than he used to be. The previous volumes show him having more heart; gone are stories like ""The Forgotten"" and ""It's Never Too Late"", which deal with themes such as forgiveness, redemption and compassion.
There have also been several changes to the designs of the characters, ranging from minorly annoying to terrible. Batmans' cape and cowl have gone from being dark blue with black shadowing to simply black, and as Bruce Wayne he has a different facial appearance. I found this minorly annoying. The Joker is now drawn minus his trademark red lips and Killer Croc has been redesigned with a green scheme. To me, the worst redesign was with Catwoman; gone is the shapely grey catsuit she wore, she's drawn in an all black suit, with pale skin and an exaggeratedly skinny silhouette; which just looks like lazy drawing for this show. Admittedly, even from the beginning, the Bruce Timm shows depicted these characters with angular, exaggerated proportions, but I think what the did was unnecessary.
That being said, there are certainly some good points about this volume: ""Double Talk"" and ""the Jokers' Millions"" were both episodes that did interesting things for some of Batman's' villains.
And I actually found the twist with the final episode, ""Judgement Day"", to be pretty enjoyable (I'd even seen the episode years earlier, and was still surprised having forgotten it and watched it again).",1458172800,3,2227,4.847769028871391

I really don't care much for the animation style compared with the original Batman: TAS first two seasons. Also, I did have some difficulty removing two of the discs from the case (eventually succeeding, but being extremely cautious about damaging the discs). There are a couple of other episodes which I like - but for the most part, this would be more of interest to those who want 'complete' collections.

2406413,4,B000B7QCHC,"This completes my Batman animated series collection. In many ways this is as good as the original episodes. In other ways I prefer the originals. Its nice that Dick Grayson has become Nightwing and that Tim Drake is the new Robin. Some of the re-designed characters are cool - Scarecrow and Bane. others are no gain or loss - Killer Croc and Penguin - others I don't like. I can understand why they made Poison Ivy's skin tone whitish as opposed to flesh color - but I like the flesh color better. I don't like the Joker's eyes - even though he is relatively unchanged. My biggest dislike is Catwoman - the original episodes Catwoman looked better. In these newer episodes when she is in the Catwoman suit her mouth area (flesh) is colored white (like Poison Ivy's new skin) but when it shows Selena Kyle not in her Catwoman suit she has regular fleshtone skin - Why Is This? Its irritating to me. Also the villians in the newer episodes seem more two-dimensional - simply ""bad guys"". In the original episodes they seem more emotionally and psychologically complex. Commissioner Gordon looks like he's going to die - I guess he's older so it makes sense. Eh - it is a cartoon after all - but I'm sure others will agree with me. Still worth the buy - but I would suggest purchasing the first 3 box sets first and saving this for the last purchase. At any rate 90's Batman in any regard is certainly better than the old Batman/Tarzan hour from the 70's and the ""Superfriends"" of the 80's.",1452643200,5,1486,4.487084870848708

As in most TV seasons you have 1/3 of the episodes that are excellent and are important to the lore/storyline of the character.  Then, 1/3 of the episodes are okay,
and may introduce new heroes or villians.  Finally, you have 1/3 of the episodes that are  poorly conceived and are a struggle to watch.  I did not like the updating they did to the characters especially Scarecrow, Batgirl, and Catwoman.  However, all this said, watch it and enjoy the 8 episodes anyway.",1446595200,,591,4.625

The writing, animation, characters, voice acting and musical score are unparalleled; darkly humorous and surprisingly non-violent. Season four could've been better, though, as the plots in some episodes fail to thrill like those from the early seasons. Season four also brought animated blood, which was completely out of habit with the first three seasons--not vulgar, but unexpected.",1444867200,,551,5.7317073170731705

But still there is still a quality here that is lacking from a lot of modern day animated shows, and its still entertaining even for someone watching for 90's nostalgia purposes.

2406611,4,B000B7QCHC,"Most of the stories are still good Batman stories, but the new animation style (compared to previous seasons) especially with the villains throws me a bit. There is a bit dumbing down of Batman, for example when he calls a dinosaur a giant lizard and get pithy with Commissioner Gordon when he is corrected, and there is one outright magical episode including the demon Etrigan. Although I understand why they did this, I prefer a smart Batman that doesn't have to deal with magic. The coolest thing about Batman is that he is a scientist/engineer first, detective second, and ninja third. In recent years this has been flipped around to please dumb audiences (see Batman the Brave and the Bold). At least Brave and the Bold starts out odd so it isn't jolting when magical things happen. Still, the majority of the episodes are interesting and worth watching if you've watched the other seasons.",1442448000,3,895,4.818181818181818

2406882,4,B000B7QCHC,"Before you freak out with this being a 4 star rating, let me warn you-this is not as good as the Batman Animated Series (Vol. 1-3).  There are some very disappointing episodes mixed in this set.  Most of these episodes contain new villains to the series.

However, despite these episodes there are some really GREAT episodes included.  These episodes are just as good as the original animated series and are worth getting this collection for.  Joker's Millions, Legends of the Dark Knight, Mad Love, Old Wounds, Holiday Knights, Sins of the Father, Never Fear, Over the Edge & Cold Comfort are the standouts.  There are a few more good episodes but again their are some duds.

It should be noted that there are obvious changes to the animation from the original series.  Some of which work well: the scarecrow, Penguin, Poison Ivy.  Whereas some just do not work: the Joker and Catwoman.
I recommend this set if you love the original series and can get this at a good price (under $20).",1436313600,,986,4.686046511627907

2406975,4,B000B7QCHC,"I love the show as a whole.  My only problem keeping this from being a 4 star is the way it's obviously episodes, possibly from different shows, put together as more of a collection.  At times things aren't even in a chronological order.  For instance they introduce Tim Drake after he's already been on there as Robin.  Perhaps that's the way it originally aired, perhaps not.  I really don't remember at this point in time.  Great series though.  Definitely worth the watch as a Batman fan!",1433721600,,492,4.651162790697675

4.12 Over the Edge - just has to be seen

4.13 Mean Seasons - isn't too bad

4.19 Legends of the Dark Knight - doesn't quite suffer from the changed artwork, because it draws upon artistic styles and stories from other sources (and the commentary track is interesting, too)

2407569,2,B000B7QCHC,"While Season 3 was the series zenith, the revamped ""The New Batman Adventures"" (which premiered on Kids WB three years after the original series ended) feels like BTAS lite. Though the original voice cast returns, and it's interesting to see how much some of the characters lives have changed (e.g. Nightwing, Mister Freeze, Scarecrow), the streamlined character design, cheaper and more generic animation, and storylines rehashed from other Warner Bros. series (""Torchsong"" is a Scooby-Doo plot) doesn't even play on the same level as the original series.

Though I disagree with the direction they decided to take with this season they still managed to tell great stories. A few of the villains took odd turns and the animation style isn't as gritty and dark as the first 3. If you are a Batman fan, or a fan of super hero animation you should still pick this up for your collection",1403568000,,403,4.315789473684211

This series was more tame than the newer series, more like the time period: behaviors and language very typical of the 40's and 50's time period. Still very entertaining and good acting. Love the Batman voice.
I just wish that the newer ""The Batman"" series would have lasted longer, it did well though (4 years) which for today's cartoons is good. It seems like every time we see a good adventure/action cartoon series, get hooked, look forward to more and get involved with the whole storyline, characters, etc,; after just 2 seasons, it ENDS !! What's up with that ?? Take polls or something from your public fans, they are the viewers and will keep your popular shows' fan positive feedback coming in which will lead to more advertising revenue.and so on.

2407592,4,B000B7QCHC,"Volume 4 doesn't disappoint on the storytelling that Volumes 1-3 made standard. This volume introduces more of the Bat family and so I think that is an interesting direction for the show to take. The one negative I have to mention is the changes in animation from the previous volumes and this one. That make it so that I only give this volume 4 stars. I'm not sure why they decided to redesign a lot of the characters. Poison Ivy and Catwoman are now white or pale and seem to lack the detail and care given them from previous volumes. The Batman redesign isn't too radical, and I don't mind that change. The only character redesign that I might prefer over the other volumes would be the Penguin. Anyway, if you like the other volumes of the show, you should definitely watch this volume. The slightly different look is only minor and the interesting stories and fine voice acting still make this volume part of the greatest animated series ever.",1400544000,,948,4.58235294117647
2407593,4,B000B7QCHC,This series really shows the Dark Knight and the real insanity of the villains that belong in Arkham. I also liked the fact that the story expanded to Batgirl and KnightWing,1400544000,,173,4.612903225806452
2407594,5,B000B7QCHC,"Some have said this not the best, but this volume has some of my favorite Batman episodes. These were originally broadcast as The New Batman Adventures from 1997 to 1999. I always liked the Harley Quinn episodes-- a sexy lunatic, dangerous, femme fatale, but behaves and sounds like an air head. A weird combination that works. She often pairs with Poison Ivy, who is a serious feminist vigilante who loves plants more than people, but she creeps me out.
  This set has numerous intriguing stories:
  ""Sins of the Father"" is a Tim Drake origin story
  ""You Scratch My Back"" has Catwoman getting Nightwing to team up with her in a hunt against a gang, but it is all test to see whose side she is really on.
  ""Growing Pains"" Clayface creates a girl as a scout which Robin thinks is a real girl.
  ""Love is a Croc"" Baby Doll fals in love with Killer Croc. Has Batman & Batgirl walking through the sewers ""I'll Never Get This Smell Out of My Costume or My Nose,"" ""Normally I'm Opposed to Spanking, but This Time I'll Make an Exception""
  ""Over the Edge"" Batgirl dies, crashes onto the windshield of her father's police cruiser. Gordon arrets Batman for murder. All based on the anxiety that Barbara fears her father will fight Batman over her night job. But he already knows she is Batgirl and trusts her.
  ""Cult of the Cat"" Catwoman is pursued by a fanatical cat themed cult of thieves. Once again Batman teams up with her to defeat the villains.
  ""Old Wounds"" Dick reveals to Tim the secret of the strained relationship with Bruce and Barbara. Probably the set's best episode.
  ""Girl's Night Out"" Livewire escapes, Supergirl and Batgirl team up to find her, but Livewire has joined Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy. Batman barely appears.
  ""Mad Love"" the famous Harley Quinn origin story and a personal favorite of mine.
  ""Beware the Creeper"" Most lunatic episode ever. The Joker throws reporter Jack Ryder into a vat of chemicals and turns him into the wacky, maniacal The Creeper. Has several references to the Animaniacs. Has Harley Quinn's best lines.
  The box set has lots of Batgirl: ""You Scratch My Back,"" ""Cold Comfort,"" ""Sins of the Father,"" ""Holiday Knights"" [where she changes into her costume in a department store], ""Love is a Croc,"" ""Torch Song"" [""Same thing as every night, Pinky""], The Ultimate Thrill, Critters, Old Wounds, ""Girl's Night Out,"" and ""Chemistry.""
  Yet also has one of the worst episodes: ""Critters"" a stupid satire of farmers as supervillians and genetic engineering. Weird, bizarre, doesn't work. Another terrible episode is ""Joker's Millions."" This one also just doesn't work, The Joker isn't that stupid.
  On the whole, the best of the 4 box sets.",1400025600,2,2683,4.786492374727668

2407598,5,B000B7QCHC,"This series essentially revived the dramatic action animation during the 90's.  It directly influenced the mythos of the comic book source material (particularly noteworthy: the inception and development of the character Harley Quinn originated here and was later worked into the comic book universe).

The writing, voice acting and artistic style (especially in the first two seasons) were seminal in the field of comic book derived animation intended for older audiences. There is drama, pathos, and great storytelling. Having said that, there is nothing objectionable (in terms of explicit material) to be found here that prevents this from being enjoyed by the 6 to 12 yo crowd as well.

If you saw it as a kid, it's worth re-watching. If this is your first exposure to the series, any fan of Batman (newly minted or lifelong) is in for a treat.",1399593600,,849,5.00709219858156

2407601,4,B000B7QCHC,"The forth season of the acclaimed Batman Animated Series saw a change in the art style, which can be jarring for fans who have been with the show from the first season. Compared to earlier seasons the animation has been simplified, with starker, less detailed characters.

However the Animated Series is still a great series; the definitive batman universe for many fans. Some standout episodes are Joker's Millions and Mad Love both featuring the Joker showing both the comedic and dramatic strength of the show.",1399248000,,513,5.035294117647059
2407602,5,B000B7QCHC,"This season is fulled with so many entertaining episodes. My favorite is ""Over the Edge"", DO NOT READ THE EPISODE DESCRIPTION if you can, it spoils the surprise. There are some funny episodes, like ""Joker's Millions"", mixed with some serious ones, like ""Growing Pains"". This season has some very good backstory to the characters, like Nightwing's and Batman's estranged relationship (""Old Wounds"") or Harley Quinn's origins (""Mad Love""). This season doesn't hold back with entertaining Batman stories. The whole 90's Batman Animated Series is my favorite DC cartoon series, with the Justice League cartoons as a close second. The art, music, writing, and voice acting really works well together. I can't recommend the show more for Batman fans and people into cartoons.

If you want to see more Batman after this season, check out the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoons aired in 2001-2006, it by the same creators and writers, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, with most of the same voice actors.",1398988800,,1006,5.134146341463414

2407609,2,B000B7QCHC,"I really enjoy the first 3 seasons of Batman the Animated Series. I've held off from buying this season due to it's drastic departure artistically from the first three seasons, but I found it for $10 and thought I'd give it a go. Sadly, I didn't get my money's worth. I'm not sure what the production crew was thinking when they changed the look and tone of the show. The character renditions are weak and lacking. Stories are rushed if any story exists at all and the violence level is beyond what is tolerable in a kids show. This seems like a contract fulfillment to get justice league underway and to sell some toys. Low quality look, feel, and execution = 2 stars",1396137600,,668,4.439024390243903

2407611,5,B000B7QCHC,I can't help it! I'm just a Batman freak and I'm loving it. I love the whole Batman animated series and wish they had made even more episodes than what they did but oh well. Well I hope you in enjoy this volume as much as I did.,1395705600,,228,3.7708333333333335
2407612,5,B000B7QCHC,My son is enjoying this season. They should make cartoons now for kids like these. Joker has undergone a slight transformation this season. Good clean fun.,1395705600,,155,5.0

2407616,2,B000B7QCHC,"To be blunt- the animation for season 4 sucks! For some reason, probably production costs, the cheap animation used in season 4 puts a wet blanket on any sparks of creative story telling. Also, too much focus on the new Robin and Bat Girl seemed to gear the stories to the pre-school audience.",1395360000,2,293,4.547169811320755
2407617,5,B000B7QCHC,This is a great animated series. At first I didn't take to the animation style being a throwback to the Tex Avery cartoons but it grew on me a little when I was a kid.,1395360000,,167,3.8
2407618,3,B000B7QCHC,"Compared to the first 3 seasons, the animation for the fourth is horrible. All characters suddenly have heads too big for their bodies and the animation is brighter and lacks detail. Plus, you get the added annoyance of Robin is suddenly a little kid and Dick Grayson is Nightwing for no reason. What? Did I miss something? This doesn't get explained until a story on the third disk, where they backtrack. Ouch.
Still, once you accept the crappiness, there are some great stories that make this well worth the pain to stick with it.",1395100800,4,532,4.670212765957447
2407619,5,B000B7QCHC,Great animation and storytelling.  The voices are the best to date (including the feature films) even after all this time.,1395014400,,122,5.1

2407623,4,B000B7QCHC,"I really just live this series as a whole. To me, when I envision batman, this cartoon is what I see. For the series overall; the choice to use a black background the odd juxtaposition of noir and pulp elements amidst a more modern setting all make for a truly memorable and unique cartoon. Having said that, the later episodes (the batman ""new adventures"") lost something when they changed to an animation style more reminiscent of the superman animated series. That's the only reason I knock a star off this particular collection.",1394668800,,532,4.793478260869565

These voice actors have become iconic within the DCAU and did a superb job at giving life to these characters.

2407640,3,B000B7QCHC,"While seasons 1-3 are fantastic, season 4 was very much a disappointment. They changed the animation, and there are even a few swears and instances of taking the Lord's Name in vain in every episode of this season. It's just not as enjoyable as the first three seasons, and I don't love the newer animation style.",1392854400,2,313,4.607142857142857
2407641,5,B000B7QCHC,"The show switched networks from Fox to the WB (now the CW) for the forth season.  The new network was much more relaxed about censorship and oversight.  This let show runners Paul Dini and Bruce Tim take the show ""Over the Edge"" creatively of any thing they had done before.  The show gave us a few comedic episodes like Joker's Millions, Beware the Ceaper, and Girl's Night Out.  It also gave us some of the most dramatic episodes of a cartoon to air on a non cable network.  Never Fear, Growing Pains, Old Wounds, Mad Love, and Over the Edge really put the Darkness in the The Dark Night.  The running theme through ths season is that Batman becomes so obsessed with his war on crime that he starts to loose his identity as Bruce Wane.  This is what gave birth to the idea that the public prosona of Bruce Wane is the costume and how he is in the Bat suit is his real personality.  He really is the Bat Man.

The only real negative of this season was some of the visual redesignes of some of the characters.  Unfortunately the fumes from the airbrushing technique the animators used the previously sesons was literally poisoning them.  Since they had to change styles anyway they did a massive overhaul of all the characters.  Some characters like like Batgirl, Killer Crock, and the Scare Crow came out better for it.  The Joker on the other hand was a bit of a misstep.  They took away his red lips and eye makeup.  It takes a few episodes to get use to the minimized look.  But again, the writing is so good that you get over it.",1392595200,,1534,4.348591549295775

2407683,2,B000B7QCHC,This was a big step down from the orginal batman animated series. I would say that in this series the actual batman character changed for the worse. He is more dark and violent in this series. Most of the episodes are brawls between batman and his enemies. There are also many new wierd and bizarre villians introduced in this volume even though the villians from the orignal batman animated series were spectacular. The new character designs were also big change for the worse. All of the characters have a much more cartoony and wimpy look. It's harder to see the emotion in the villans with the new character designs. I highly recommend not buying this volume or any of the following animated series in the DC universe. The last good series in the DC animated universe was Superman the Animated Series. This volume really lost the proper feel batman should have and made the show too violent and meaningless.,1383782400,2,911,4.735849056603773

Yes, the reality of it all; with crazy killer clowns, vengeful body builders, two-faced and insane former public officials, and a bevy of other human monsters that create fear and panicBut what if they had a cartoon to lighten that reality up a bit, and relax the citizens in the process.  This might be that cartoon, only displaying the Dark Knight in a surreal, yet intriguing place, where the bad guys are not so bad, and they always get captured. Where Gotham looks like a mix between Alex Proyas Dark City and an Edward Hopper painting, with touches of German Expressionism thrown in for good measure

This series is for the pre 911 Batman fans, when we didn't know fear and sickness like we do today. Its a less harsh, more fanciful look at the Caped Crusader, in a fun and innocent way that might just take you back to a time when the world was just a bit less nuts.",1377129600,,963,4.429378531073446

2407723,4,B000B7QCHC,"Please note I am a huge fan of Batman and the original Batman: The Animated Series. This volume marked a distinct change in the series. I remeber as a kid this marked essentially the end of the true BTAS run and its transition into the Batman/Superman series whiched aired on the WB on saturday mornings. The animation changed, the style theme and tone of the show changed a dramatically as well. The sort of noir style of show was replaced with a slightly slicker but still dark tone. This includes the character designs themselves. Batman, batgirl, robin (now tim drake), joker, scarecrow and nearly ever other major chraer underwent changes physically of some kind. The focus of the story shifted from batman and his exploits more to his relationships with his surrounding cast. We are introduced to some new characters and expand on some old ones. And ultimately the show shifted to a decidedly younger audience. I remember the original BTAS being a primetime show on Fox and th ONLY animated show inthe 90's that allowed characters to use real guns not lasers, while this one is definitely aimed more at saturday morning audiences.

I think people get upset when they purchase this and they it is not exactly what they expect.

While not exacly the original BTAS it is definitely worth a watch...at least not as bad as WBs abyssmal 'The Bat-Man' series or the pre-k aged Batman the Brave and the Bold (which i actually liked).",1356998400,4,1431,4.766129032258065

2407729,5,B000B7QCHC,"Though the series took a change in its look - opting for a less ""film noir"" look - the series, which actually aired first as ""The New Adventures of Batman and Robin,"" later alternating with Superman episodes, it still carried on the tradition of great storytelling, wonderful voice acting, and continuing to offer a show that appeals to both young and old.

This set features the familiar rogues' gallery, still featuring bravura performances from Mark Hamill (Joker), Paul Williams (Penguin), Scarecrow (Jeffrey Combs), Richard Moll (Two-Face), David Warner (Ra's Al Gul), Michael Ansara (Mr. Freeze) and the wonderful Arlene Sorkin (Harley Quinn), among others.  In fact, four episodes feature Quinn and that's enough to make this a keeper.

One-time only appearances are made by genre favorite Malachi Throne and the late Elizabeth Montgomery in what would be her last television performance.

There are some really exceptional episodes but the truly standout installment is the delightfully weird ""Chemistry.""  In this one, Batman, Robin, and Batgirl must deal with a villain unlike any other that they have faced.  The late Peter Breck, known by baby boomers as Nick Barkley on the old ""The Big Valley"" show of the 60's, really threw himself into the role as a character twice-removed from Jed Clampett.  The episode comes complete with commentary and what a wonderful commentary it is.

2407733,4,B000B7QCHC,"It's a shame they only did 24 episodes after WB brought the series back from haitus on their own fledgling network.  It's a good series that had a lot of potential and went before its time.  Though, it's nice to see this bundled with Batman: The Animated Series because it's a continuation of that story line.

First, I'm going to talk about the changes.  Almost three years had passed between the end of the previous series and this one and a bit of time had apparently passed in the fictional world as well.  They made the movie SubZero in between the two series and that is taken into account in this series.  In the time between SubZero and this series, Dick Grayson has moved out of the Batcave and Wayne Manor and struck out on his own under the new identity Nightwing, as he eventually did in the comics (though, it took him 40 years to do so in the comics.)  Meanwhile, Batgirl has moved in and is Batman's main partner.  There's a nice episode on Disc 3 that explains how this came to pass as Nightwing tells the story to the new Robin.  The new Robin is Tim Drake.  The producers decided to skip Jason Todd, which is fine with me as I never really cared for Jason.  However, they did give him Jason's back story, which is more tragic and also allows him to become Bruce Wayne's ward, as Jason did in the comics.  Tim's dad was still alive in the comics, so there was no reason for him to become Bruce's ward.  Also, since they used Tim Drake's first Robin costume from the comics as a base for Dick's costume in the first series, they used his second costume from the comics as the base for his costume in the new series.

Aside from moving and adding characters, they also changed a lot of the character appearances for the show.  For the most part, there aren't big changes, but all of the characters did at least get a slight redesign (except Harley Quinn) and some got total redesigns.  The four villains who got total redesigns were: Killer Croc, The Scarecrow, Clayface and Penguin.  Of those four, I like them all better in the first series except Penguin.  For the first series, they used the Tim Burton/Danny DeVito Penguin as a guide for the look of the character. (and, fortunately, only for the look) For the newer series, they went back to an old school Penguin look from when the character first appeared in the comics and I like it a lot better.  So, that was an improvement.  For the rest, I like how they look in the earlier series better.

Story-wise, this series is up to par with the last one.  It maintained the same staff overall and the same level of writing.  There are only a few episodes I don't care for, the rest are all good to great.  Also maintained in this series is the art level of the first one. They stuck with the ""dark deco"" style that was so striking in the first series.  Aside from the afore mentioned character changes, the artwork is very good.  The only thing that may have been better in the previous series is a wider range of color use.  However, the narrower pallet of the newer series doesn't detract from the look much.

Overall, this is a good series and a good DVD set.  The only thing it could use is more special features.  The first three collections have several featurettes, this one has only a small thing on the villains on the first disc.  Other than that, it just has commentaries.  (which all of the discs have)",1352073600,,3383,4.397745571658615
2407734,5,B000B7QCHC,"I gotta say, I love Batman: The Animated Series Volume 4, which is the episodes from The New Batman Adventures. This volume features the final 24 episodes of the Batman series (although it isn't the last time we see Batman, obviously). Also, this is Volume features new animation for every character, as well as the vehicles being redesigned. For instance, Batman's suit goes from a gray suit with the classic Batman Logo, to a gray suit with a new Bat Logo, and a new utility belt. Batgirl's suit is redesigned to match it in the comics, Tim Drake (3rd Robin in the comics, after Jason Todd) becomes the new Robin, and Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing. My personal favorite episodes in this volume are Holiday Knights, Sins of the Father, Cold Comfort, Joker's Millions, Over the Edge, Old Wounds, The Demon Within, Legends of The Dark Knight, and Girl's Night Out. In Holiday Knights, it's a triple segment episode. In the first segment, it's December 22nd. Harley and Ivy are out of Arkham, and decide to hypnotize Bruce Wayne to take his credit cards to go on a shopping spree. In the second segment, it's December 24th, Harvey Bullock is undercover as a Mall Santa Claus to capture a bunch of Child Shoplifters, who turns out to be parts of Clayface. Barbara Gordon is nearby, and becomes Batgirl to stop Clayface. In the third segment, It's December 31st. Joker decides for his resolution to not kill people for 1 year, so he decides to kill a lot of people at the New Year's Eve party in Gotham City. Batman and Robin stop him, and at about 2 am on January 1st, Batman meets up with Commissioner Gordon to say that they're glad to have survived another year. In The Sins of the Father, Batman encounters Tim Drake, who becomes the second Robin to help Batman and Batgirl stop Two-Face from unleashing chemicals in Gotham City. In Cold Comfort, this episode takes place after the DCAU movie Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero, who at the end of the movie, Victor Fries learns his wife is now awake, but doesn't go to be with her. She got tired of waiting, left him, and married her doctor. Mr. Freeze then decides to make everybody else feel how he feels to be alone. It is also the last you see Mr. Freeze until the season 1 Batman Beyond episode Meltdown. In the episode Joker's Millions, one of the Joker's enemies leaves him 250 Million Dollars, which only a part of it was actually real money. In The Episode Over The Edge, Batgirl is exposed to some of Scarecrow's Fear Gas, which causes her to have a nightmare. In her nightmare, she falls off the roof to her death when Commissioner Gordon finds out who she really is. Gordon then goes through Barbara's computer, and finds out that Batman is Bruce Wayne, Robin is Tim Drake, and Nightwing is Dick Grayson. The Commissioner then begins a manhunt against Batman, even recruiting Bane to help him. In Old Wounds, Nightwing reveals to Robin the reason why he quit as Robin. Some time prior, Dick Grayson graduated college. He then was out with Batman one night, and Batman attacks one of the thugs working with Joker in front of his own family. Robin leaves after seeing this. In the end, Dick quits being Robin, and punches Batman right in the face. This episode also reveals that Batman knew who Batgirl was, but never told Robin, and how Batgirl finds out who Batman and Robin are. In The Demon Within, it features Clarion the Witch-Boy, who is attempting to get a Brand Iron that belonged to Morgaine Le Fay (later appears in Justice League), and Jason Blood is attempting to get it as well. When Blood almost loses it in the auction, Bruce steps in and buys the brand for 1 million dollars. Clarion gets it back, to use it to separate Etrigan the Demon from Jason Blood. In the end, Etrigan merges back with Jason Blood. In Legends of the Dark Knight, it has a few kids telling their story of what they think Batman is like (similar to the DC Animated Original Movie Batman: Gotham Knight). In the two segments, the first has Batman and Robin designs from the 1950s comics, and the second features the segment from the Book The Dark Knight Returns.
Finally, in the episode Girl's Night Out, it features Batgirl and Supergirl teaming up to fight against Livewire, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn. This is one of my all-time favorite episodes, as it features the girls being the heroes for the first time without Batman or Superman. This volume, like the others of course, feature special features.

2407742,5,B000B7QCHC,"My five yearold and three year old LOVE LOVE LOVE this show. They watch it constantly. For those who are fans of the old Batman animated series (my husband and I are), we couldn't wait to show these to our kids. The animation is a little different. I don't like the style as much as the old one. I guess they changed the style to match the Superman animated series. Whatever. The stories are still excellent, particularly the ones that involve the New Robin and Nightwing (the old Robin.)

What parents should be warned about is that there are some instances of the characters taking God's name in vain. I realize that for many this may not be a big deal, but for those who don't want their kids saying, ""oh my god!"" at age 3, be warned. We had to have a long talk to ours about this. We realize we can't shelter the kids forever, but these words didn't seem to happen in the earlier seasons.

All in all, a great show. Watch it with your kids if violence scares them, or start them off with the older episodes which were more mild.",1339977600,,1032,4.287179487179487

I purchased all the seasons from here last year, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the show! It is still in a lot of people's minds, the best representation of Batman outside of the comics. Definitely a must have for any Bat fans!

Volume 4 changed art styles in order to resemble the Superman animated series they were working on at the time. Leaving many characters revamped visually, most of them for the worse. However, the quality of storytelling and everything else is still here in this last season of episodes. Still a fantastic show, and if you want the whole experience, get this volume too. I would recommend volumes 1-3 first, but this one is still great and recommended as well.

2407746,5,B000B7QCHC,"All together, Batman: The Animated series ran a long time (I think more than 200 episodes). It went by different names in the time it ran, and moved to different channels. It started in the early days of Fox Kids. This was back in the start of the golden age of cartoons. Much later with the move to Kids WB (The other outstanding channel/lineup of the time) the style changed too. The character designs and Gotham city setting went through considerable change. I find these to be improvement. I like the changes all-around better, and I might say the only flaw in the whole thing is more of the episodes could not be made to this style. I suppose the earlier episodes could not be made to match because the entire setting had little changes. It was does to work alongside the related Superman series.

It does have the grain of an older series, but it is largely unimportant to me in this case. The DVDs of the series were divided in such a way that this set contains all the New Batman Adventures episodes, and so all the existing episodes in the style. Some people see the changes as a negative. I say we only needed more like these! And I have to say, it is a reminder like being allowed to visit the best days of Kids WB and Fox Kids. I write this after only watching episode 1, and I never understood why anyone would not like the changes, but of course it's fair to say some episodes are better than others, and the first Holiday Knights is not the best. I saw most episodes from TV airings.",1334620800,,1498,4.330960854092527
2407747,5,B000B7QCHC,"People have been giving this volume quite a bit of hate, of which I certainly don't think is deserved.  The animation is, of course, different, which is what I think warranted a lot of negative reviews.  However, the story writers, production team, and even voice actors (except save Barbara, who gets a more high-pitched feminine voice) are still the same as the other three volumes - the only thing that is changed is the animation.  And there is a reason why.

The team behind Batman: The Animated Series was also working on Superman: The Animated Series at the same time.  Not only did they have to outsource a few episodes to Japanese animation companies (The ""Over the Edge"" episode's animation was actually outsourced), but they wanted a smooth crossover to be possible between Superman: The Animated Series and the Batman animated series.  Since Superman's animation was much sharper, they wanted the new re-vamped batman series to match superman's animation more closely.  ""Girl's Night Out"" is a perfect example of the two worlds of Metropolis and Gotham coming together - this definitely would not have been possible with the old animation.

After a two-year break from the Batman animated series, they chose to return to it, with a revamped animation scheme, of which, with these items in perspective, makes sense - they had reasons for altering the animation, of which are all explained in full in this volume's wonderful director's commentaries and extras ;)  (And, to go even a step further in explaining this new animation, this new re-vamped animation also paved the way for a smooth transition with the team's ""Justice League"" TV series, which ran from 2001-2004.  So there you go!)

The women, in my opinion, look exceedingly better in this volume than previous ones - I like the male animation better in the old volumes (I think it gave them more character), but I digress.  There were reasons for this change which are very well-supported reasons.

My advice when first watching this volume: skip ""Holiday Knights"" and watch the rest of the Disc 1 FIRST.  ""Holiday Knights"" is exceedingly childish, and (in my opinion) was a pretty bad way of introducing this new volume to Batman-fans (but yes, yes, I know, they listed these episodes in the order they were created lol).  I often wonder if most of these bad rating happened because of frustrations with this first-episode??  So yes, skip that episode and come back to it - you'll thank me later ;)

Same great story lines, same voice actors, just a little different animation.  Batman is darker and more brooding in this series, which helps promote the need for more of Bat-girl, Robin, and Nightwing.  Tim Drake/Robin often serves as a source of genuinely funny/snarky comic relief, and certainly doesn't feel out of place in this series like I thought he would.

Overall, get this volume!  It's truly a delight, and is certainly exceedingly enjoyable to watch (especially Nightwing's fascinating story line in this scheme of things).  There are so many gems in this volume, if you don't get it, you're really missing out! (Mad Love, Nothing to Fear, and Old Wounds are just three of the greats on this volume).  So ignore the haters - get this volume! You won't be disappointed :) <3",1332633600,2,3258,4.894353369763206
2407748,4,B000B7QCHC,"Volume four of Batman Animated was pretty good in my opinion. I rather enjoyed such episodes as ""Over The Edge"" and ""Old Wounds."" That being said, I too did not particularly love the revamp of the animation. It might have worked better had they continued another season on. I had come to love how the first three seasons looked and I didn't particularly like how they made all the characters, especially that of the female figures which were super curvy and lanky. But hey, that's just me.

The only other complaint I can really issue is that some of the story lines sort of breach what happened in the previous seasons. Myself, being very attached to the first three seasons became a little annoyed with this issue. Any die hard fan of this series needs to go into this season with a little different mentality and not expect the same treatment of the predecessors.

The animation is different, some of the voices are different (only a few), and the characters are slightly different. For example, in the first three Bruce Wayne and Batman have different voices both voiced by Kevin Conroy while in this volume Batman and Bruce have the same voice voiced by the same voice actor. I also think this set tries to make Batman look more human and less invincible. It focuses more on the story as a whole and Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl rather than how the events affect Bruce/Batman. Altogether, I like this set almost as much as the first three volumes.

Batman made an appearance and got his own show back when Superman went into it's 3rd season. Batman The Animated Series, now called The New Batman Adventures had a lower budget and the animation had to fit with Superman because there were bigger plans for the DCAU. The animation is excusable and most of the character animations and voice acting, I actually prefer in this set as opposed to the first 3. One thing that I did notice is that the episodes do take a somewhat darker tone and some of them are not well written. The writing quality was better in the first 3. But this show is essential to the DCAU at large. Tim Drake isn't used enough as Robin and Batgirl is used to much, probably because she wasn't used enough in the first 3 seasons. There are still good quality episodes here and it's still an essential for Batman fans, especially if you're trying to collect the entire DCAU.",1326240000,,1007,4.538461538461538

2407765,5,B000B7QCHC,"Batman The Animated Series had come to an end 2 years prior this show starting. Batman The Animated Series, was well recieved by fans, tv watchers, and highly claimed as the best animated series ever made. Fox wanted to continue the series but the show came to an end because the creators were just burnt out from doing so many episodes, that they wanted to leave the series on a high note and quit while they were ahead. After taking time off the creators then began work on Superman The Animated Series (also a good show)that aired on the WB instead of Fox. Batman was still highly popular that WB demanded more episodes of Batman. The creators used the animators of Superman series because of time constraints, so they decided to revamp the show. Giving new looks to different characters. Though the art style may be different, the stories are still there.

This 4th season focuses more on action, darker themes and introducing more plots with Robin, Batgirl, but the story telling is still there.  It can be a bit inconsistent because some shows feel like filler where its just Batman beating up the run of the mill bad guy for that episode, but there are alot of touching moments in this season. Like the episode where we learn why Robin left Batman, other episode where Batman trains the new Robin, and my all time favorite where Batman is discovered to be Bruce Wayne i won't give away the details but its awesome seeing Swat invade the wayne manor.

I've been watching the previous boxes slowly over the years (I'm currently on the last two DVDs from Vol. 3) and I always felt like: ""Man, this show was waaaaaaaaaaaay better when I was a kid"". A lot of the animation was way, way poor and, although the stories were good, this factor was a real downer. But eveything changed with Vol. 4.

The stories are darker (aimed, clearly, to an older audience) and the animation is wicked (thanks to the Japanese Studio TMS - mentioned a lot of times during the ""Over The Edge"" commentary).

I think I missed this series (""The New Batman Adventures"") during its original run but I've seen Batman TAS & can still watch reruns of it on the DXD channel.

""Batman The Animated Series"" was a wonderful show for both kids & adults.  It had amazing animations, stellar voice actors, & great storylines.  This show (TNBA) just doesn't hold up when compared to its predecessor.  The voice acting is as great as always & the storylines are still pretty good (not great) but I don't care much for the new character designs, especially The Joker's and Poison Ivy's.  Everything is more streamlined & less detailed.  I prefer the previous versions.

The one new design element that I DO like is that they finally gave Bruce Wayne blue eyes instead of the generic dark colored eyes from TAS.  I've always believed that characters should be portrayed as accurately as possible and it bugs the heck out of me when they're not.

I also like the expanded ""Bat Family.""  Batgirl is one of my favorite characters & I'm glad to see her get some screen time.  As a girl/woman, I enjoy watching female heroes kicking butt.  I also like the introduction of the new Robin (Tim Drake) & Nightwing (mullet & all).

The special features seem a little sparse.  There's a case file that features the main villains.  It gives you a profile on each one & a brief commentary by the show's creators.  Each disc also has one episode where you can play it with the commentary on.  Hopefully, the previous volumes will have more in-depth features.

2407792,3,B000B7QCHC,"When Warner Bros. ordered 24 new episodes of Batman: The Animated Series (BTAS) in the Fall of 1995, it was as if the prayers of one million heroine addicts were all at once answered. Creators Paul Dini and Bruce Timm and our entire crew of suppliers were back on the streets. As much as that promised, however, The New Batman Adventures (TNBA) didn't prove the ultimate fix. What we got instead was two short seasons of a very mixed bag.

Now, I'd like to point out here that, invariably, within any artistic medium, things change. Sometimes the change comes from maturity and growth, and other times it comes from simply the need to be different. Since the original BTAS was, as a whole, near perfect; I have a fair bet that with TNBA, the change came out of the latter.

The biggest and most obvious change was the character modeling. Gone now were the rounded, asymetrical shapes reminiscent of traditional Art Decco traded in for a more angular and squeaky-clean approach. While some characters made the transition without too much tweaking (e.g. Harley Quinn, Commissioner Gordon and even Batman himself), others were completely re-designed. For some of the characters, this was an improvement. For others, it was a catastrophe which still makes me cringe.

Let's start with the successful make-overs. Catwoman looked great. Her new jet black outfit and ghost white eyes (like Batman's) made her more of a symbol rather than a thrill-seeker in a kitty suit. The new Selina Kyle looked great, too, and was modeled after the regular Batman comic continuity as a short-haired brunette. Poison Ivy worked just fine and was also made more true to her comic book persona with chlorophyll saturated skin and eyes. Batgirl, though not a drastic change, looked much better with a sleek new figure sans the baby fat (in fact, they made her a down right babe). Scarecrow, although I thought his second manifestation in BTAS was just right, was made even more frightening with more ghoulish features and a noose around his neck.

What didn't work? JOKER. Why in God's good name they did what they did to the Clown Prince, I'll never truly know. They basically took a wonderfully complex and expressive character model and turned it into a bad cartoon. In fact, the lipless, beady-eyed, three-color shadow of his former self never looked worse, on ANY medium. I'd even take the vintage model of the Joker featured on ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" over the TNBA version. My God, man... I'm getting worked up just writing about it. If Bruce Timm's goal was to simply make the Joker easier to draw and animate (perhaps to sacrifice quality for consistency) then he surely succeeded. And not even Mark Hamill's brilliance could overshadow this sad fact. Luckily, since most of the Joker episodes were bad anyway, nothing huge was lost... with the possible exception being ""Mad Love"". Now, with that said, it seemed a lot of fans were able to get over the Joker's new design. I simply could not. And the fact that the Joker's model was changed again for the Batman Beyond movie is testatment that Dini and Timm knew they had made a mistake (see my brief mention of ROTJ below). Freeze and Penguin were other failures, and don't even get me started on the Riddler. I would, however, like to mention Scarface, another model that suffered a terrible transformation (not so much the Ventriliquist as the puppet itself). Once again, all previous animated brilliance was traded in for a block character I could practically draw myself. As with the Joker, however, no big loss considereing how sacharrine and stupid was the one Scarface episode.

So let's talk about some episodes. Right at the outset I'd like to say that half of the episodes aren't even worth mentioning. The rest have varying degrees of good and fall into two categories: those with heart and those with a fast enough pace to thoroughly entertain. Are there a few awesome five star episodes? Yes, but only a few. ""Over the Edge"", ""Old Wounds"", and ""Growing Pains"" are excellent. ""Mean Seasons"" also comes to mind with a great one-off villian. ""Mad Love"" would also qualify if it weren't for the half-ass Joker. Those episodes all have true heart and are delivered with the fervent zeal we came to expect from BTAS. The best of the rest would be the well animated and action-packed episodes like ""Holiday Knights"", ""Cult of the Cat"", ""You Scratch My Back"" and ""Girls Night Out"" (a surprisingly fun team-up of Batgirl and Supergirl versus Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn and Livewire).

TNBA did cover some new ground and the first thing you'll notice watching just about any episode is that Batman himself is colder and darker than in BTAS. This serves as both a blessing and a curse. It's cool that Dini and Timm were able to explore a Dark Knight more in line with that of Frank Miller or Jeph Loeb. And on that note, episodes like ""Never Fear"" and ""Old Wounds"" go about as far as they could go in an animated network TV show. On the downside, however, is the fact that this leaves the supporting cast of characters -- namely Batgirl, Robin and Nightwing -- to make up for all that lack of heart. Nevertheless, I have to say it works only because Batman would, in truth, harden over time.

Which brings me to the now infamous flashback sequence in the Batman Beyond movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Beyond-Return-of-the-Joker-The-Original-Uncut-Version/dp/B00005Y71K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker (The Original Uncut Version)</a>. For those of you not familiar with the Batman Beyond animated series (or if you just never cared to give it a go like me... until recently), it makes no difference. Halfway into the movie, TNBA fans (and BTAS fans, for that matter) get a special treat. Dini and Timm decided they'd show us the final battle between Batman and the Joker in the regular timeline. And, man... is it AWESOME. Remember my rant earlier about how bad the new Joker model looked? Well, guess what? They got it right! If this had been the Joker that was featured in TNBA, I would have shed tears of joy. Suffice to say, you just have to see it. But make sure to see the UNCUT version of the film. The studio version is not at all the same and was toned way down for the kiddies.

I've included here a very brief episode guide.

Season 1

""Holiday Knights""
Though more of a novelty, a lot of effort went into this episode. The Harley and Ivy segment alone is worth it.

""Sins Of The Father""
Not a lot of effort went into this Two Face episode.

""Cold Comfort""
The name says it all. A perfect example of when you run a character concept right into the snowdrift.

""Never Fear""
A unique romp into Frank Miller territory. I guarantee Dini and Timm had fun with this one.

""You Scratch My Back""
Some great Nightwing and Catwoman ass-kicking here. Cool episode overall.

""Double Talk""
Just a thousand shades of awful, especially compared to the excellent couple of Scareface episodes in BTAS.

""Joker's Millions""
If you're into old school fie-diddly-dee Joker (like pre-Killing Joke) then you might like this episode based on a vintage Joker tale. Otherwise, Joker's Millions is ridiculous and has no place in the current Batman continuity (sorry, all you old school purists ;-)

""Growing Pains""
One of the few TNBA stories with real heart and a great Tim Drake episode.

""Mean Seasons""
Deliciously dark, this episode has the kind of substance we came to expect from the original BTAS.

""The Demon Within""
Let's just say... interesting. I actually dug the shapeshifting werecat (if only Catwoman could fight like that!)

""Over The Edge""
Awesome. Bane fans will have an added treat.

""Torch Song""
Uh... next.

""Love Is A Croc""
This episode is a crock.

Season 2
""The Ultimate Thrill""
I was thrilled to hit STOP halfway through.

""Critters""
So terrible that Timm and Dini thought they'd do a commentary to redeem themselves. What a waste of a special feature.

""Cult Of The Cat""
Another good Catwoman episode. She's two for two in TNBA.

""Animal Act""
Not bad. Some good Batman/Nightwing stuff here.

""Old Wounds""
My second favorite episode next to ""Over The Edge"". Tells the story of Dick Grayson's departure from Batman. Good stuff...

""Legends Of The Dark Knight""
Just some old campy fun (if you're into that sort of thing).

""Girls' Nite Out""
I really enjoyed this episode. And I'm actually glad that TNBA relegated Ms. Quinn back to her subservient origins. After ""Harley's Holiday"" in BTAS, there was really nowhere left for her character to go (she sort of fulfilled her autonymous arc). Let's face it, Harl, you work best as either the Joker's hench wench or as Ivy's girl toy.

""Chemistry""
This wasn't such a bad episode. Ivy's ploy turns out to be quite clever. Oddly enough, the only thing that really doesn't work here is Kevin Conroy's voice acting. Bruce Wayne is way too cold in this episode. But check this out... it's only one of two episodes ever where a supervillian may have actually met her maker. In the finale, Poison Ivy is swept out to sea during a massive explosion, Batman is unable to rescue her, and there is absolutely no reason or indication to make the audience think she survived from potentially drowning.

""Judgment Day""
Ahh... so we do get one good Two Face episode! And this is the other episode where a supervillain gets it!

""Beware The Creeper""
I can't understand why so many Batman fans embraced this one. It's completely ridiculous. And, yet again, the Joker is about as menacing as his Three Stooges henchmen. The most enjoyable thing about this episode is watching Harley continuously reject the advances of a man who's actually crazy about her.

""Mad Love""
If the new Joker doesn't bother you , there's a lot to like here. Hamill does some of his best work and Sorkin is much more understated than usual (though not really to my liking). As brilliant as the graphic novel was, and as faithful as this adaptation tries to be, it never quite gels. Still, some great stuff, and I especially dig the scene between Harley and Batman over the fish tank.",1231286400,14,10121,4.818339100346021
2407793,4,B000B7QCHC,"This volume isn't as good as the first three, but at least it ends the original series. There are a few changes that I can't really say I like.
The graphics are considerably different, they seem to be cheaper. The original Robin is a new hero, but there is still a Robin who fights alongside Batman. Bottom line, it's not all that bad.",1228780800,,335,4.333333333333333
2407794,3,B000B7QCHC,"Batman: The Animated Series is a great show in its own right. The New Batman Adventures (Volume 4) is good, but not really that spectacular.

For one thing, the animation has been changed, so that it looked similar to the Superman animated series that ran along with it. Some parts of the animation has improved, but the redesigns of the characters can't cut it. I hate the way the male and female anatomies are in stark contrast: the men are tall and muscular, and the women are short and skinny. In BTAS there were hardly any contrasts between men and women. Is it because boys these days prefer their girls shorter and skinnier than they are?

And it's not just the anatomy, it's the villains as well. I really don't like what they did to the Penguin. I mean, Burton's re-imagining of the character made him more interesting. I enjoyed his presence in BTAS. But here in TNBA, he's back to the traditional comic book look. I do respect the comics, but the Penguin now looks very dull. I prefer his more bird-like appearance. Next, there's the Mad Hatter. In BTAS, he was of average height. But here he's now a midget. I don't have anything against midgets really, but here the Mad Hatter now looks like a stereotype of the typical Disneyesque Mad Hatter we have in our minds. Catwoman here is shorter and skinnier, and her white eyes really ruin it. She looks more of a weakling here than in BTAS. The Riddler's green suit and bowler hat have been replaced with a green jumpsuit. Why? He looked way more intelligent when he had that business suit on. Why take it away from him? Oh, and let's not forget about the Joker. His red lips are gone, and his eyes are more cartoonish. He looks less threatening in ""Joker's Millions"" and ""Beware the Creeper"" than in ""Joker's Favor"" and ""The Laughing Fish.""

But not all redesigns are bad. Clayface, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn somewhat stay the same. Killer Croc looks and sounds more humane, while Bane still has that killer appearance. The Scarecrow is now more frightening than ever, though I do miss Dr. Jonathan Crane, who dons the mask in BTAS. Mr. Freeze is sorta . . . meh.

As for our heroes, they're not all bad, except when it comes to Batgirl. She's in too many of the episodes, and she's sometimes annoying. And so is Timothy Drake as Robin. The creators must've created him to appeal to younger folks. He won't work well with older viewers. I can tolerate the fairly cleaner appearances of Comissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock, and Officer Montoya, though Gordon looks a lot weaker here.

The episodes themselves are somewhat mixed. ""Growing Pains"" and ""Never Fear"" contain high suspense, while ""Critters"" and Love is a Croc"" can't live up to BTAS episodes like ""On Leather Wings"" and ""Mudslide"". ""Girl's Night Out"" is just flat-out irritating. ""Beware the Creeper"" is rightfully entertaining as The Creeper falls for Harley Quinn. Episodes with Nightwing/Dick Grayson are great as well. ""Over the Edge"" ranks with the classics.

The New Batman Adventures really is a weak point in the animated series. But it's not as bad as the horrid new series called ""The Batman.""",1226966400,5,3126,4.705667276051188
2407795,3,B000B7QCHC,"I love Batman TAS but The New Batman Adventures is just not as good. So lets just get to the point. The new batman adventures takes place in the same continuity as Batman TAS so just think of it as a sequel to Batman TAS. There are 24 episodes in this volume. I only enjoyed 13 episodes out of the 24. The 11 eleven remaining not so much, because either they were disappointing or just plain awful. Some bad episodes are, Critters, Beware the Creeper, Mean seasons, and the list goes on.

I was really disappointed by some of the joker episodes. I'm sure they're good episodes but I just hate how the joker looks. Those stupid eyes that he has, what were they thinking? This is a Batman show, not Animaniacs. The fact that the joker looks stupid pretty much ruins most of the joker episodes for me. I just can't take him seriously, he looks like one of the animaniacs or something. BAD redesign.

There were too many joker episodes in this volume and just too many average episodes. There's no Riddler episodes which is a shame. They could of made two riddler episodes and replace some crappy episodes. Another catwoman episode wouldn't of hurt. More Nightwing would of been cool.

Anyways there is some GREAT episodes in the volume like , Legends of the Dark Knight, Over the Edge, Old Wounds, You scratch my back, Cult of the cat, and a few more.

So this box set is pretty much a mixed bag. You have your GREAT episodes but then you have a few god awful episodes, some average episodes and some descent ones. I still want to buy this volume, believe or not, simply because I really love some of the episodes included here, especially the ones with nightwing. I already own Batman TAS volume 1-3,and I'm willing to buy volume 4, but it will be for the right price.",1225584000,2,1766,4.441358024691358

2407797,4,B000B7QCHC,"Two years after the end of Batman: The Animated Series, the show was revived as The New Batman Adventures, which encompasses the 24 episodes on this set.  By the time the show returned, it had lost a couple of key creative people, and the entire look of the series was reconceived in a more angular fashion.  The real life break was mirrored in the series' chronology, meaning these episodes take place 2 years after the events of the last set.

Evening knowing all this, the transition from the last set to this one is jarring.  It is not immediately clear why Batgirl is allowed in the Batcave, or why a new Robin, Tim Drake, has replaced Dick Grayson.  A couple characters are so radically redesigned it is not clear who they are at first.  A few secondary characters have been recast, and in most cases you will miss the original actors.

A lot of fans have expressed a dislike of the new artwork, and which admittedly lacks the charm of the original designs.  Some characters - like Batman, Bane, and the now truly scary Scarecrow - look better than ever.  Others, like Harley Quinn and Clayface, look basically the same as before.  And unfortunately, some characters (Mr. Freeze, the Ventriloquist, and the Mad Hatter spring to mind) look much, much worse.  You will adjust to the new look, but not until midway through the set.

These episodes also stray from some of what made the original series so special.  More action oriented than before, the show lacks the atmosphere and mood that made the earlier episodes so fascinating.  Many of the new villains fall flat, lacking the psychological depth of the original Rogues Gallery.  The focus on wham-bam action also leaves less time for character development, a hallmark of the original series.

There are still some great episodes on this disc.  The faster pacing and increased action pays off in spades during ""Over the Edge,"" which shows the aftermath of Batgirl's apparent demise.  ""Old Wounds"" is a fascinating exploration of why Dick Grayson quit being Robin (that would have benefited from being two parts).  This set also has what is in my opinion the series' best episode, ""Mad Love.""  Recounting Harley Quinn's origin, it has the kind of deliberate pacing and emotional maturity that was so successful on previous sets, as well as career best performances by Mark Hamill and Arleen Sorkin as the Joker and Harley Quinn, respectively.

In fact, the saddest thing about this set is how it ends just as it finds its groove.  The last 8 or so episodes are quite strong, and it's a shame this new group of artist and writers weren't given more time to play in this world.

This set has some interesting extras, particularly the Interactive Arkham Asylum (basically a group of featurettes on the main villains).  Unfortunately, the customary 4 commentaries have been reduced to 3, with one of them wasted on the absolutely awful episode ""Critters.""  Given the reduced episode count, an increase in extra content would have been welcomed.

Fans of the show should definitely check this set out.  It may not be quite as good as the old episodes, but it is still better than 90% of the current crop of action cartoons.",1222905600,,3177,4.771062271062271

I was terribly disappointed in volume four, because the animation is no where near the quality of the first three volumes, so visually it is not as good.  Gone are the shading, shadowing and face definition that made the first three volumes so pretty and compelling to look at.  The new format of telling a story fastpaced in 15 minutes takes some getting use to, however would have been ok had the visuals not been compromised.  The new Robin is a child and the idea of a child being able to be effective after seeing the young man Robin, took a leap of faith.  The one good thing about this set is that the voices remained the same.

The new ones are way too cartoony and takes away from the real life feel to it. I mean have you seen how they updated the new joker for the new Batman series I find it strange. I guess it depends what era you grew up on and these were it. I highly recommend this final box set to the 90's series.

Batgirl is portrayed for the first time ever on t.v as a sexy smart and intelligent woman that is a welcome addition to the animated mythos. The episodes, torch, and over the edge show that she is a valued commodity. Unlike the newer batgirl in the rather terrible new 'the batman' series.

The first three seasons are fantastic.  I gave the first and third five stars and second four stars.  The story lines for the individual episodes and the series were very good, as was the animation, characters, voices, action...pretty much everything was as it should and couldn't really be made better.  The show even won an Emmy in the beginning.

The fourth season, however, was when the animation style completely crossed over to that of Superman, which was okay, but not quite as good as the first three, either.

The real problem, however, is the writing.  Most of the episodes are pretty lame, especially ""The Demon Within"", ""Holiday Knights"" and ""Legends of the Dark Knight."" The rest of the season is merely forgettable. The story lines are just not written with the same depth and quality that made the first three seasons great.

In volumes 1-3, it was done in comedy, in volume 4, it's done in anger and is way more domestic violence than I'd like it to be.  Another problem with this set is that it just jumps straight in with a new Robin in the first episode, with no explanation until the second, and the rest of the story later on.

2407845,4,B000B7QCHC,"Batman Animated morphed into this incarnation in the later years. When it aired it shared an hour with the Superman cartoon. To make it fit better with the other show, they did character redesigns. Batman's costume was changed from the old blue and grey to black and grey. And they drew him, and everybody else, much more thin and angular; in effect he didn't look like Space Ghost anymore in this run..

One good thing about this show, not content to keep retreading variations on the same old stories, lots of characters got more developed. Dick Grayson, Robin I, becomes Nightwing, and in ""Old Wounds"" we see how and why. There's more Batgirl (eh...). We get Robin II, Tim Drake (the 3rd Robin in the comic--basically sharing the same backstory of the street-punk, second Robin Jason Todd from the comics). We get changes in story and appearance in villians  like Mr. Freeze, Bane, Scarface and the Penguin. The villian who benefits the most is Scarecrow. With the Leatherface mask and the noose around his neck, he's never looked scarier, even in the comics (kudos to the team behind this show for acknowledging that Scarecrow should actually be SCARY).

In some of the episodes (""Over The Edge"" in particular), the animation is simply outstanding, as are the scripts. Others frankly are just plain bad: ""Critters"", and the Baby Doll / Killer Croc episode come to mind as really bad (and if anyone needed an awesome redesign it was Croc). The angular way they draw everyone gets to be annoying. The show goes from looking like a comic in the early seasons to merely looking like a cartoon.

There are sheer delights in this collection, however; The Harley / Ivy segment in the holiday episode; Harley's origin (verbatim from Paul Dini's ""Mad Love"" one-shot Batman comic); an appearance by DC Comics character the Demon; ""Legends Of The Dark Knight"", which cleverly references the Batman work of comic artists Dick Sprang and Frank Miller; even the Roxy Rocket episode I like quite a bit.

2407846,4,B000B7QCHC,"I bought this DVD because I remember liking this new version beter than any episode of the last 3 seasons, and they don't air reruns on Boomerang. Let me tell ya, it's worth the money. The costumes of both the villians and the heroes look way better than they did in those older episodes. The episodes are  way more actiony, and that's a good thing for an action lover, like myself. Plus, there's one crossover episode called ""Girl's Night Out"", where Super Girl and Batgirl team up to defeat Livewire, Poison Ivy & Harly Quin. Some of the best episodes are:

-Sins of the Father

-Double Talk

-Never Fear

-Joker's Millions

-Old Wounds

-Legends of the Dark Knight

-Beware the Creeper

-Judgement Day

Special features include:

-Commentary

-Interactive Arkham Asylum

-Languages & subtitles

On the downside, there's too many episodes with Batgirl. That's the only downside I can think of. This product gets a 4/5. Kudos to WB.",1155427200,2,933,4.822784810126582
2407847,4,B000B7QCHC,"Volume Four completes the animated Batman saga with one of the greatest comic book to animation adaptations to date.  Volume Four is the best of the volumes for many reasons.  It's the most recent of the four so the animation is better quality, the designs for the characters have been changed, the addition of Tim Drake Robin and Nghtwing is a major plus, and the stories are top notch.  Like any complete volume there are standout episodes and there are ones that aren't quite as good.  Some of the standout episodes are:

Sins of the Father

Growing Pains (I feel is the best of this volume)

Over the Edge

Old Wounds

The Demon Within

Legends of the Dark Knight

Girls' Nite Out

I rated this volume only 4 stars because of a few things.  Some of the new character designs were welcomed as others should not of been changed.  I didn't like the new Penguin, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, and Bane.  I also thought there is too much Batgirl.  It seemed she was more of Batman's partner than Robin or even Nightwing.  I can't stand Batgirl.  Some of the more popular villains weren't even showcased.  I would of liked to see a few Riddler, Ra's, Bane, and Penguin episodes.  Bane and Penguin only had minor roles.

Overall a great ending to one of the best animated sagas.  This volume really opens the door to the Justice League Animated series.  A must have for any Batman/comic book/superhero fan.

A new Robin has taken the place of the old one because the latter has chosen to become Nightwing.  But this series still delivers when it comes to action and riviting storys.  Fans get to see how Tim Drake becomes the new Robin and why Dick left and decided to become Nightwing.  We also get to witness how Harley Quinn came to be.  Mr. Freeze also makes a comeback after the straight to video and Dvd movie, Subzero in a fantastic episode entitled Cold Comfort.  Clayface returns, as does the Scarecrow with a fearsome new look!(From what they tell me.)  Jason Blood aka the Demon makes his first appearance in the DC AU during this run as well.  So what's stopping you from purchusing this set?  Yeah, Joker and Twoface get their share of action too, as does Catwoman.  Oh and let's not forget Bane!  There's also an episode in which Batgirl and Supergirl pair up to stop Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Livewire, a villain from the Superman animated series, from demolishing Gothum.

2407864,4,B000B7QCHC,"This was my favorite season of the Batman animated series.  I loved the character redesigns and the addition of the Batgirl and the Tim Drake Robin to the supporting cast, which added a lot of humor to the proceedings.  There are some fantastic episodes in this set, particularly ""Over the Edge,"" in which the death of Batgirl prompts Commissioner Gordon to hunt down Batman, ""Legends of the Dark Knight,"" which features vignettes in the style of legendary Batman artists Dick Sprang and Frank Miller (of Sin City fame), ""Girl's Night Out,"" which teams Batgirl and Supergirl against Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn, and ""Mad Love,"" which finally reveals Harley Quinn's origin.

Unfortunately, all of the season's episodes are NOT included in this set.  Contrary to what other reviewers have written, NONE of the Superman cross-over episodes (the three part ""World's Finest"" and the two part ""The Demon Reborn"") are included in this set.  For ""World's Finest,"" you must either buy the stand-alone DVD or volume 2 of the Superman animated series collection.  ""The Demon Reborn"" will presumably be included on the not-yet-released third volume of the Superman series.  Including all of these episodes in both the Batman and Superman collections would have been a nice gesture.  Instead, Warner Bros.' decison to place the episodes only in the arguably less popular Superman collections feels like an obvious ploy to squeeze more dollars out of Batman fans.

Additionally, some packaging and production issues blemish this otherwise excellent set.  Dust particles and other visual artifacts can be seen in every episode.  And while remastered, pristine video quality might have been too much to ask for, an insert or booklet with episode descriptions (only the episode titles are given) woud have been much appreciated.

Overall, a four star rating.  The episodes themselves are of five star quality, but the production and packaging issues drop the rating a notch.",1141430400,13,1957,5.194267515923567

Here we are in the company of the whole clan: Robin, Batgirl, Commissioner Gordon, and the ever dependable Alfred. Warner Brothers knew what they were doing with this show, and also with the Superman and Justice League series. All three are the kind of thing I dreamed about when I was a boy, reading the adventures of these modern day mythical heroes. The color, richness, excitement, and drama produce the kind of immersive aesthetic experience we expect from great art. It's not over the top to say that this series, and the others, falls into that category. My hope is that everyone who ever watched the show will harrangue Warner Bros and compell them to release box sets of the whole Justice League and Justice League Unlimited runs. I'd buy them without a second thought, and so, I'm sure, would millions of others.",1140739200,4,972,4.723529411764706

I think this volume should be considered seperate from the previous three volumes, because the changes the animated series made.  Number one, the animation itself looked awefully cheap, when compared to the previous version. Why change the animation ... for the worse. Number two, why in the world did Batgirl  seem to become Batman's partner? Too many episodes had her in them ... TOO MANY! The third and final reason this volume of episodes lacked ... stories. Don't get me wrong, some of the episodes were very solid, such as, Sins Of The Father, Over The Edge, Animal Act, and Old Wounds. However a number of the other episodes really stunk, none more than the weirdest story ever, The Demon Within.

I enjoyed the fact that Dick Grayson became Nightwing, and Tim Drake became Robin ... so much, that I feel that a better series than Batman Beyond, would have been a Nightwing series. The Old Wounds episode would have been a great bridge story for this!",1140480000,29,1027,4.726256983240224

Only Harley is unchanged and you see her origin along with lots of other Harley episodes.  This season has the origin of Tim Drake as Robin since Dick Grayson moved on to be Nightwing and ALOT of Batgirl.  It has most of my favorite episodes on it including aptly titled ""Over the Edge"".

2407880,3,B000B7QCHC,"All in all, this would an acceptable series,

However, I grew up with the original series, but only saw 2 or three episodes of the new adventures, and now, 7 years later, I picked up this set.

What can I say; I just can't bring myself to really like or hate this instalment in the btas series. It's kind of like lettuce...

on the one hand, come on, it's Batman, from the makers of BTAS

on the other hand, it's got some major flaws.

For starters, I just don't like the new character designs. All characters look worse in my opinion, except Harley and Clayface. Well, okay, I can forgive Ivy and Freeze as well; except for that Pretorious thing they did to him...

the characters that got the worst reworks are in my opinion Bat girl and the Joker.

I made it a point to check, and there is almost no scene with batgirl where she doesn't have a grin plastered on her face, unless she's getting beaten or dying.

Come on, what happened, is she sniffing joker gas in her spare time? Creepy.

Then there's the joker. Even though he's slowly walking away from just playing pranks, there is just nothing menacing about him. The only thing that keeps him from being a total caricature of his old self is Mark Hamil, even though his performance is a little less menacing than in the previous incarnation, (or his later performance in Batman Beyond).

Also, the show doesn't strike me as dark either, and the music, one of the old shows strongest points, is a little lacklustre here...

Then there are the characters themselves. They generally feel a lot more 2-D here. They're not cardboard cut outs, well, except for firefly, but they just have less meat to them. And some characters go against what they were in the original show. Also, this pulled along more by comedy and action than story, sad to say.

Generally, the episodes themselves would be okay, with a few really bad ones, and a few really good ones... only the following lived up to what I expected from the show. Over the edge, Mad Love, Mean season, never fear, old wounds, Double Talk, and of course Judgement Day. (although the judge beats up crock to easily for my taste.)

Some bad episodes include:

Critters: I'm not going to get into Farmer brown and his pink floyd animals. my first reaction was ""What drug addled brain did that come out of?!"" though somehow.. it is a little bit of a guilty pleasure episode now... it's just so bad, it's almost good again..

Then there's The Demon within, which, though not a bad episode, should have been justice leage material. Batman is a logical, scientific hero. I love magic as much as the next guy, but batman shouldn't be too mystical. Sci-fisch okay, but somehow I don't like the Idea of spells and the like  with him. (now a mutation, that causes the same effect, I'd have no problem.)

Beware the Creeper: okay, this episode is just silly. The only saving grace is harley. For some reason, It felt like watching an episeode of ""the mask"". The way the creeper acts and talks just pushes that impression further. ""Must get revenge on the joker. Buuut Fiiirst."" Come on, the guy gets squashed by a crate containing a statue, and he just walks away from it, but a little tranquiliser puts him out? Hmm...

So, Is it a bad show? No. in fact, if it wouldn't fit into the cannon of the first thee box sets, It would be great. Problem is, it partialy re invents, and partialy goes on with the old show, and the two styles just clash in my oppinion. It's definitely worth the purchase for old wounds, over the edege and mad love. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the episodes.",1137110400,6,3593,4.484662576687117

2407882,5,B000B7QCHC,"This entire series was created by the fans for the fans. The animation is clean and the characters are true to their comic history. This volume holds season 4 of the series. The animation has changed for this season. While I personally preferred the style from seasons 1-3, this is still excellent.

My personal favorite is the legends of the Dark Knight episode. This episode has a segment in the classic Dick Sprang style and one segment that is almost a direct copy from Frank Millers ""Return of the Dark Knight"".",1135900800,4,516,4.670329670329671

I loved the original animated series and I didn't want anything to change.  So throughout the run of the New Batman Adventures, I had a chip on my shoulder.  But watching them again now, with some distance from my initial gut reaction, I don't really feel so upset about the designs.  In fact, I think a lot of them do actually look better, especially Scarecrow.  What hasn't changed is my feeling that some of these episodes just aren't as well written as the original series.  Still, there are some real gems in here, such as the dark and beautifully animated ""Over the Edge"" and the extremely fun ""Legends of the Dark Knight"".  The commentaries are fun, though I always wish there were more of them.  I took off one star, partly because this revamp just doesn't speak to me as much as the original series, and partly because I really wish they'd included the New Batman/Superman Adventures intro, even if it was just as a special feature.

Personally I always felt the animation in the early BTAS episodes were weak and ""iffy"" at best, even if the stories themselves glued you to your seat.  However, with these later episodes nothing is sacrificed, as both the story and animation function in great synergistic fashion!

I feel that vol. 4 will be the best seller of the 4 available.  I'm currently being proven correct in that assumption it seems, as I have found this vol. 4 at only a smattering of stores, as most are sold out.  In other words, get this vol. 4 set now and enjoy some of the best episodes this wonderful show had to offer!",1134432000,2,926,4.587878787878788
2407885,4,B000B7QCHC,"Continuing the storyline from the original Batman: The Animated Series, we find Bruce Wayne still fighting the good fight in Gotham with a brand new Robin and Batgirl by his side. Dick Grayson (the first Robin) has meanwhile left The Dark Knight and established his own identity as Nightwing but still fights with Batman occassionally.

This set is a mixed bag. While not as classic as the ""dark deco"" episodes, there are some gems among this collection:

DISC 1

Holiday Knights - Three different tales that take place during the Christmas and New Year holidays where Batman, Robin and Batgirl faces off with Poision Ivy, Harley Quinn, Clayface and The Joker!

Sins Of The Father - Tim Drake, an orphan left homeless by his criminal father, stumbles across a confrontation between Batman and Two-Face. A series of events follow that lead to a new Robin.

Cold Comfort - On the heels of the animated feature ""SubZero"", Mr. Freeze unexpectedly returns to seek cold revenge! His fate on the heels of that tale will shock you!

Double Talk - The Ventriliquist fights his past as Scarface by trying to go straight but some of his old buds won't leave the past in the past.

You Scratch My Back - The first appearance of Dick Grayson as Nightwing as he forms a dangerous alliance with Catwoman to take down gun smugglers, much to the dismay of Batman.

Never Fear - Exposed to The Scarecrow's new gas that suppresses fear rather than induce it, Batman's rages threaten to turn him into what he swore to fight against.

BONUS: Interactive Arkham Asylum - See files and hear from the creators of Batman: The Animated Series on some of The Dark Knight's more fearsome foes.

DISC 2

Joker's Millions - When a rival crime boss dies from natural causes, he leaves millions of dollars to The Joker....or so it seems!

Growing Pains - Robin, in his first rebellion against Batman, tries to save a girl from a superstrong mysterious individual against Batman's orders.

Love Is A Croc - Feeling they are kindred spirits, Baby Daul helps free Killer Croc only to discover that though they are both viewed as freaks, they are not soulmates.

Torch Song - Unable to cope with rejection by a famous singer, a former stage worker turns his fascination with fire into a dangerous weapon and becomes Firefly!

The Ultimate Thrill - Roxy Rocket, a former stuntwoman who was bored with that world, turns to crime to find the ultimate thrill and seeks the ultimate chase with Batman!

*Over The Edge - One of the best episodes of this version of the series as Batman, Robin and Nightwing face off with....Commisioner Gordon?!

*This episode has alternate commentary from Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Glen Murakami and James Tucker.

DISC 3

Mean Seasons - A crazed former model goes on rampage in Gotham's higher society.

*Critters - Farmer Brown, a brilliant bio-chemist, turns to extortion to continue to fund his research by creating super bugs, animals and other freaks to tear Gotham apart.

*This episode has alternate commentary by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Dan Riba, Glen Murakami and James Tucker.

Cult Of The Cat - Batman & Catwoman become reluctant allies against an insane cult when Catwoman steals a valuable item from them.

Animal Act - Batman & Nightwing team up to find out who is using circus animals to commit robberies. The fingers seemingly point to someone from Nightwing's past but it is someone far more sinister.

Old Wounds - In this story, we finally find out what happened that split up Batman & Robin (Dick Grayson).

The Demon Within - An old friend of Bruce Wayne is under siege by his alter ego, the demon Etrigen!

DISC 4

*Legends Of The Dark Knight - While tracking down Batman and Firefly, three youths tell tales of the Dark Knight. This episode was in tribute to Dick Springer (50's Batman artist) and Frank Miller (80's Batman artist/known best for The Dark Knight Returns).

*This episode has commentary from Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Dan Riba, Glen Murakami and James Tucker.

Girls' Nite Out - With no Robin, Nightwing or Batman, Batgirl teams with Supergirl (from Superman: The Animated Series) to help her take down Poision Ivy, Harley Quinn and Live Wire!

Mad Love - Very grim tale that recounts how Harley Quinn met and joined up with The Joker.

Chemistry - Bruce Wayne unexpectedly marries but becomes Batman again when one of his oldest friends goes missing. Plus, an old foe returns and revelations about his new wife!

Beware The Creeper - Reporter Jack Ryder gets exposed to the same toxic chemicals that created The Joker! Now, Batman must decide if The Creeper is a threat or an ally.

Judgement Day - A new hero named The Judge is taking out Gotham's Underworld....but using lethal means to do so! This brings him into confrontation with Batman and the revelations about The Judge are interesting to say the least.

I have to say this version of the series is a mixed bag. While some eppys are okay, some are very good while a couple just stunk! My faves from this volume are Over The Edge, Sins Of The Father, Mad Love (the darkest of all the eppys in this volume) and Growing Pains.

As for the revamps, I can accept the changes to the Bat-team. The worst change without question was The Joker! Thank God they went back to closer to what he looked like in the original series when they made Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker and of course, Justice League! The best change was The Scarecrow. He actually looks menacing in this version.

Overall, this set is still a must have if you wish to see all the Batman episodes outside of Batman Beyond or Justice League. Until the Batman Beyond set is released, this volume will round out Bruce's journey nicely!",1134000000,19,5679,4.701010101010101
2407886,3,B000B7QCHC,"Volumes 1-3 were phenomenal! Sadly, Volume 4 is a pale shade of a once great legacy.

The producers completely lowered the bar by going the route of Superman TAS which was a big no-no. Gone were the amazing opening title cards and replaced by the title in simply white lettering on the screen...Just like S:TAS. The dark, noir-ish animation replaced by bright, bold colors...Just like S:TAS. Less focus was placed on the previous award winning plots and action was emphasized...Just like S:TAS. A pulling away from real-life stories and replaced by magic, laser beams, etc...Just like S:TAS. It is no wonder this show only lasted a year & S:TAS was soon cancelled as well.

Other Negatives:

Too much Batgirl! She was like in almost every single epsiode!!! Overkill!

Not enough Nightwing! Far more interesting a character, yet he was shafted.

Awful new villians: Calendar Girl, Farmer Brown, Roxy Rocket, some dumb kid and his cat, oh and how about that Cat Cult... total rip-off of Wolverine from X-men! Don't you think we could have had at least ONE Riddler show instead of these?

Terrible re-designing of old villians! What were they thinking? It looked so cheap! The Penguin, Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, and worst of all... THE JOKER!!! The Joker has no lips!!! Mr. Freeze looked like an anorexic robot, too!

The plusses! Firefly is a great new villian. The new Robin (Tim Drake) brought a lot of energy and new possibilities to the show. Batman in grey & black! Poison Ivy in a hot, green leotard and pale green skin!

In all, it is still not a bad show, but far lacking as compared to B:TAS. It is nice to have these, but it is a real shame when Batman lost his style and became a clone to an inferior show.",1133913600,12,1712,4.664451827242525

Comic books aside, Batman has been riddled (smirk) with flawed and cheesy storylines from the Adam West days of yuck-yuck to the deplorable live action films. The Animated Series recaptured much that was lost from ill-conceived direction and greed. Conversely, George Lucas initially had little greed but a great story to tell....and he ruined it.

  Oh well. Is this about Star Wars or Batman? Did I loose you?

Yes. Batman. As this is Vol. IV and from the New Batman Adventures, I question why it's included in the TAS series. It's completely ""new"" and different than The Animated Series.

  The Look - Well I don't like it. Batman decides the yellow oval on his chest is too flashy and sticks with a grey and black scheme. The second Robin, Tim Drake, feels it necessary to spike his hair in an ultra-cool fashion. I don't like it. The animation is superbly done with artwork I don't like.....if that makes sense. Sue me - I'm a die hard Silver Age lover.

  The Stories - Are great. The voice acting is simply the best in the realm of animation....and this was for television!!! A somewhat short evolution of Dick Grayson to Nightwing is explained here and I loved it as Nightwing is a fantastic character and one of my favs.

  The Sound - OOOPSS!! The greatest foopah ever and my main gripe here!!! WOW I have a choice between Dolby Digital 2.0 and what? Oh thats it. Are you kidding me? A horrible blunder from WB, all this work and oops we can't even have surround sound?

I was really disappointed to find that only 2.0 was available from Volume I in this ""TAS"" series, only to find that future volumes are exactly the same.

  Take yer Anime-styled Robin and wacky 6"" bat-ears (Justice League) artwork and well OK I'll watch. But I want to listen too. Without even the basic 5.1 surround sound, they have lost so much in what could have been a great compilation.

The best Batman ever and they screwed it up.

Last note - the arwork and presentation of all the DVD Volumes are very nicely done.",1129852800,12,2157,4.5703125
2407901,5,B000B7QCHC,"The episodes compiled in this fourth collection of the animated Batman series is from the Kids WB New Batman Adventures, which hit Saturday mornings a while after the classic Batman: The Animated Series was over with.  Most of the voice cast was retained (including Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight), but the animation underwent a complete overhaul, which would be seen on the animated Superman series as well as the current Justice League Unlimited.  The animation transformation isn't for everyone, but it works for the most part, and the storytelling is still top notch.  In the episodes collected here, we learn why Dick Grayson quit being Robin and became Nightwing, and we also see the origin of the new Robin, Tim Drake.  DC character the Creeper makes his animated debut, and there's a delicious new, and horrifying, twist and look to the Scarecrow (voiced by Jeffrey Combs).  The ""World's Finest"" episodes are here as well, which is the first (of many) cross overs with Batman and Superman as they team up to take down the Joker and Lex Luthor.  However, this volume does have it's share of low points.  The attempted new twist on Two-Face doesn't work, and the re-vamped animation is definitely going to be a downer for some.  However, the strikingly mature tone of these episodes (including a nightmare-esque scenario where Batgirl is killed and Commissioner Gordon launches a full scale attack against Batman and co.) makes this set worth owning for longtime Bat-fans, and this is most certainly better than what's being passed off as a Batman cartoon these days.",1129161600,67,1574,4.9581749049429655

But, i have always liked this( the new batman adventurs) more. Some people say all it is is action. BULL this show is amazing!!!!!!  And my favorite batman episode ever is on here, over the edge. This season also introduces my favorite version of Dick Grayson (former Robin) NightWing! And i like MOST of the character redisighns, However The Mad Hatter, And the riddler redesighns are horrible. But ont the bright side most the changes are for good. The one thing that i have to day is The scarecrow redisighn is phenomenal. I can describe it in one word (BRAVO) IT IS MUCH MORE CREEPY. so please get this it is well worth the wait.",1128902400,12,793,4.424657534246576
2407903,5,B000B7QCHC,"It's about time!!! WB has finally gotten off of their butts and finally got these episodes out. Now, if we could just get them to release the soundtracks to these episodes, I'd be in absolute heaven.

I, personally, don't get what the thumbs-down reviewers mean by ""cheap animation"". These episodes were WAY more animated; smoother and swifter. In the previous seasons, you never saw Batman do moves like he does here. Batgirl takes little back-steps to give her some leverage before springing into jumps. Tim Drake (the New Robin) uses his size to give him the edge while taking out huge thugs. Nightwing's combat style is a little more graceful and acrobatic than Batman's. All these little details add to a very realistic animation. These prior reviewers must have been watching this show with their eyes closed.

The story-telling was for a much more mature audience. Just look at the Scarecrow; the guy's got a lynch around his neck! Occasionally, a plotline will take a turn and become almost Hitchcockian. The story-telling stays on the edge throughout, constantly challenging the boundaries of a ""normal"" animated series.

As far as the visual style, while this version evolved from the previous seasons, WB really showed hesitation in straying at all from (Character Designer) Bruce Timm's rendition of this universe, and with good reason. It works, and it works REALLY well.",1128384000,19,1384,5.06140350877193

Volume four began when Bruce Timm and his team writers were ableto cut lose those sissy censors over at FOX. The began a whole new art style over at the WB studios and were welcome to make the darkest and most violent work yet. You will learn so much more about the Dark Knight and find your self learning new and darker secrets about the Batman. Make haste and buy this DVD set .

2407905,3,B000B7QCHC,"The older version of Batman: The animated series ended with a girl-type episode ""Batgirl Returns,"" with only one appearance by Batman (in Barbara's dream). Given it wasn't the best way to end the Fox syndication of Batman, it wasn't horrible. Getting off that subject, I have to say after a hiatus on watching Batman (renewed by watching the series on Boomerang), I clearly remember now why I didn't favor ""The new Batman adventures,"" as much as I did the previous three seasons/volumes, whatever. First off the most objective thing in this final installment is the art concept of all the characters and the lack of appearances of once regular characters. The Art Deco styled art is gone for good and the artist that drew for ""Superman: The animated series [1996]"" takes the stage. Bruce Wayne really looks a little too much like Charlie Sheen in my opinion. The hooked nose, the hair style, the blue eyes (I'm not sure if Sheen has blue eyes, but that's besides the point), the blocky body posture, square shoulders and the facial features don't say ""Bruce Wayne."" I also didn't favor the way he looked in his costume anymore either. He looked like a series of blocks stacked on each other, no roundness of human features to him and the bat ears on his mask were far too long and pointy. All the women in Batman look like dark haired Lois-clones and just about every other female in ""Superman:TAS."" Too skinny in the waist, no dimension to the bodies, the same eyes, hair nose, and lips.

The villains took a step down in the looks department as well; From Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman, the female villains look more pale ""evil dead"" than alive and lost all interesting aspects of their character (they're more suggestive than evil). From The Joker to the Mad Hatter, all the male villains look as though they've undergone plastic surgery and opted for a ""porcelin"" face instead of their real ones (Killer Crock is no longer gray but green if memory serves, and the scarecrow is more coat than body). I also didn't like what they did with Mr. Freeze. He really looked dead, his outfit was lousy, his feet were too large and his legs were skinny. The Heroes, like Commissioner Gordon (who's looking a bit older than originally), seemed to have lost too much weight and aren't as dynamic as before. Nightwing was probably the best one suited for the new art direction. His mullet was just fine, thank you very much. You don't hear people complaining about MACGYVER's mullet via season II & 7, stop complaining about Nigthwing's.

And probably the worse part of all concerning the characters is the loss of Dick Grayson's regular appearance, and the constant presence of Tim Drake and Barbara Gordon. Why do the creators think Batgirl is so popular? I hate the female Batman counterpart thing. She's probably the most annoying female character in Batman next to Harley Quinn. Yeah, I'm quite aware that Tim Drake is an original Batman Character, and the third robin. But he is a lot older in the comics than he is in this Cartoon.

TNBA really makes Tim a very annoying character donned in a red and yellow Robin outfit. Who in their right mind would let a boy no older than 10 or so fight criminals? Tim would've been killed first time around. However, the introduction of Dick Grayson's new persona, Nightwing (yay!) was probably the best part of the series. Downfall: You only saw him in a few episodes(and I mean a few; 04.05: You Scratch My Back, 04.11: Over The Edge, 04.17: Animal Act, 04.018: Old Wounds (the hardest episode to watch, but its my absolute favorite next to ""over the edge"") and, 04.21: Chemistry -bleh-. From what I remember, all of them my favorites), which sucked.

It would've been so nice to see him in stand alone episodes instead of him making small appearances. I guess that's what the ""Nightwing"" comics are for :-(. The newer villains (Firefly, The Creeper, etc.) in the show weren't as interesting as the older ones. In all honesty they were too easy to beat. And while there was a more violent, darker atmosphere in TNBA, with more action added, it really did nothing to move the stand alone episodes along.

And most of the episodes were clunkers. There were too many ""girlie-girl"" type episodes after ""BATGIRL RETURNS"" in volume III, and be quite frank it bothered me that Harley had so many appearances through out the last season. You saw her more than you did the joker. Alas I digress. All in all ""The new Batman Adventures"" was an all right final installment. Enjoyable at best, leaving a sad nostalgic feeling. It was never horrible, but it wasn't great either. --- [a 3 out of 5]",1127520000,6,4630,4.6900369003690034
2407906,5,B000B7QCHC,"I  have to commend WB for being so speedy about completing this series! I wonder if they will tackle ""Batman Beyond"" next? It would be really nice to see that collected as well.

It would've been a nice bonus if they had included the episode of ""Static Shock"" where Batman & Robin made a guest appearance on this set as a bonus...I guess it would technically not make sense as it would be out of place, but it is in a way kind of the ""lost episode"" of the series.",1127174400,2,463,4.133333333333334
2407907,5,B000B7QCHC,"New adventures await you and the Gotham Knights in Batman: The Animated Series, Volume Four - The New Batman Adventures! Revamped from the dark deco days of the original series with a simpler yet stylized new look, the New Batman Adventures featured the Gotham Knights: Batman & Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing in some of their most memorable episodes. Introducing the voices of Mathew Valencia as Tim Drake, the new Robin and Tara Charendoff-Strong (replacing Melissa Gilbert-Brinkman) as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, this 4-disc (521 min.) set contains all 24 episodes from the series which include classics ""You Scratch My Back"", ""Old Wounds"" and fan-favorite ""Over the Edge"". Other highlights include ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" which acknowledges the works of Bill Finger, Dick Sprang and Frank Miller. Not to mention ""Never Fear"" featuring the most horrific version of the Scarecrow (chillingly voiced by Jeffrey Combs) ever animated. The New Batman Adventures not only refined the designs of the characters (a ""taste great/less filling"" matter of opinion) but also how the stories were presented to viewers. The show's pacing and even balance of mature melodrama and stylized action would serve as a blueprint for the success of future shows Batman Beyond and Justice League Unlimited. Here are the contents of this set:

Disc 1:
Holiday Knights
Sins of the Father
Cold Comfort
Double Talk
You Scratch My Back
Never Fear

Disc 2:
Joker's Millions
Growing Pains
Love Is a Croc
Torch Song
The Ultimate Thrill
Over the Edge

Disc 3:
Mean Seasons
Critters
Cult of the Cat
Animal Act

The Demon Within

Disc 4:

Chemistry
Beware the Creeper
Judgment Day

Special Features:
Commentary: On ""Over the Edge"", ""Critters"" and ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" by Bruce Timm (Producer), Paul Dini (Producer), Glen Murakami (Art Director), James Tucker (Storyboards), Dan Riba (Director) and Moderator Jason Hillhouse.

Featurette: ""Arkham's Finest"": Inside Batman's Rogue Gallery.

2407908,4,B000B7QCHC,"These episodes were produced two years after the original Batman: Animated series ended, and were made for the KidsWB Saturday morning block, which was still relatively new at that time. What's notable about these episodes is that the character designs have been totally revamped, and this was when the ""DC animated universe"" really began, as Batman stories would often cross-over with the Superman series and vice-versa.

The real shame about The New Batman Adventures is that KidsWB basically stopped production after 24 episodes, so we don't get to see the new revamps as much as we'd like (ex. Riddler, unfortunately, only shows up in minor cameos). A host of new villains and femme fatales appear, including Calendar Girl, Roxy Rocket, and the (dreaded) Farmer Brown and his mutant farm animals. Etrigan and The Creeper make their first animated appearances, but only get an episode each (Etrigan was later fleshed out in Justice League). Most telling is that certain plot threads feel rushed, including the introduction of Tim Drake as the new Robin, the departure and return of Dick Grayson as Nightwing, and even a new twist involving Two-Face. There just weren't enough episode to tell everything the staff wanted to tell (and maybe they told one Joker story too many).

Are these episodes as good as the original B:TAS? Overall, no. It's more about comic book fights and action now. Bruce Wayne's a little stiffer and darker, and the stories have lost that humanizing touch the best B:TAS episodes had (with exceptions of course). Is the quality still there? Yes. This is still excellent entertainment for kids and adults alike, and new viewers may be surprised at how mature these episodes feel compared to the stuff on KidsWB these days.

Definitely pick up vol. 4. It's a nice supplement to the initial 3 volumes, and continues the animated legacy of Batman nicely. Here's hoping Batman Beyond gets the box set treatment next.",1126569600,230,1939,5.015527950310559
