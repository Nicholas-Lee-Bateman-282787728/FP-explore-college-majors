Therefore, my purchase of FDR's Secret War, which had no captions, was a waste of money.  Surely a great company like Amazon can figure out a way in its advertising to advise the potential purchaser as to whether its product has closed captions.  Not only the FDR DVD's, but also the Churchill DVD's I ordered from you are useless, wasted money.  Come on Amazon, I buy a ton of stuff from you.  Especially books and DVD's.  Be fair with old guys like me.  State whether or not your DVD's have captions.  Seems like a simple enough request.  Please respond.  DVD's are a significant part of my life; it would really help if I knew in advance what I was getting.",1434499200,,752,4.416058394160584
