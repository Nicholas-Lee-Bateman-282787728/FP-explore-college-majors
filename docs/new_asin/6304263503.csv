7866008,5,6304263503,"Like the title says, I have never seen this video.  But, as soon as the  money from the crystal meth selling business I got on the side pores in, I  plan on buying the video.  Then, if the money really pores in, I hope to  kidnap the makers of this series, keep them in a basement, and create the  Violence Jack: Slum King, that plays endlessly in my head.  Also, if anyone  involved in the making of the original series is dead, I will make their  children do it.  Yes, the sins of the father do pass on.  In my vision,  Violence Jack actually does become an actual Slum Lord.  He will wear  seventies pimp clothes, and he will run a slum ruled by the bloods and  Kryps in the early 1980's LA.  Here's a little excerpt from the  script:
Violence Jack:  Leroy, where's my rent money!!!! Leroy(on the  other side of the door):  Please, Mr. Jack, i'll have your money for you  tomorrow!  I swear! Violence Jack:  That's what you said two days  ago!!!
now from here, the scene can go two directions.  It can either go  into a normal Violence Jack scene, where there's a lot of violence that  doesn't make sense, or now could be a good time to introduce Violence  Jack's new lovable sidekick, his great aunt Susan.
Susan:  Violence Jack,  are you abusing your strange, unexplained powers. Violence Jack(blushing):  No, aunt susan(backround noise, audience laughter.)
I don't even know  what is happening anymore.  Never rent this video, it must be bought.  And,  although the running time is only about 35 long, if you do enough meth and  coke, it will seem like 35 years.",969235200,,1568,4.494623655913978
7866009,1,6304263503,"Good lord, this is bad. Where to begin? First of all, it's just yet another recycling of the plot of the first one: bad guys hurt people, big guy with incredible powers suddenly appears and kills all the bad guys.  This was done the best in the first volume. Second, this is atrociously  directed and edited. Apparently it was rushed out to meet demand, as it  starts off with a summary of events that were hinted at in the second  volume but never shown, it moves from scene to scene with little logic and  quickly becomes confusing, and it creates a blizzard of loose threads that  are never tied up (despite the fact that this is the last in the series!).  Nothing is resolved, and those who've been watching this series hoping to  discover the origins of the title character are going to be grievously  disappointed by the off-the-cuff line uttered by a child that's apparently  supposed to explain everything. The rushed, let's-cram-everything-in feel  probably has something to do with this episode's length: while the other  two are 60 minutes, this one's about 35.
Third, it's utterly pointless.  While the first volume made the admittedly unoriginal point about the evil  that men do when stripped of their civilized veneer, and the second  half-heartedly recycled that theme, this one is just scene after pointless  scene of rape, murder and revenge. The sex content has been upped  considerably from the last episode, and is apparently supposed to be a  turn-on (yep, nothing like watching a spiked whip cracking across the bare  buttocks of a terrified young woman to get your mojo working), but it's  just offensive.
So what we've got here is a bunch of scenes of various  atrocities tacked together with little rhyme or reason and no point  whatsoever unless you're a fan of gore and misogyny.
The first volume is  worth owning. The second is worth renting. This one is worth burying.",956793600,,1898,4.826086956521739
