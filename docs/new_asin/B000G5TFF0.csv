8128936,5,B000G5TFF0,old and dry but okay.  better to read cycling greats magazine on Merckx.,1441065600,,72,4.538461538461538
8128937,5,B000G5TFF0,"I think that is the best documentary about the Cyling.
In my opinion the Giro d'Italia is the best ride, and in this dvd you can see the Giro of the '74 with all the best riders of that years : Merckx, Fuente (one of the best climbers ever seen), Felice Gimondi (the world champion), Battaglin, Moser etc.
I suggest you to buy this DVD where is included also a documentary about Eddy Merckx titled ""la Course en Tete""",1258416000,,417,4.291139240506329
8128938,2,B000G5TFF0,"The cycling video on both programs is good, but the first program ""La Course en Tete"" has no narrative or voice overs - its just video footage of racing and some behind-the-scenes between races with a music track.  Boring.  I was expecting something about Merckx (bio, career, etc, etc).  The second video on the Giro is good.",1248307200,,326,4.684210526315789
8128939,5,B000G5TFF0,"This is probably my favorite of the old cycling documentaries, and the best if you want a to get a look at Eddy Merckx.

The DVD is split into two films. The first is La Course en Tete (head of the course, or group/pack) and focuses on Merckx himself and his great career.

The second film is The Greatest Show on Earth, and a very captivating film on the 1974 Giro d'Italia. It shows Merckx, and all his rivals very well. You'll come away cheering for Jose Manuel Fuente, the greatest climber of his generation who was one of the only men with the grit to attack Merckx. Simply great old footage.

If you're used to TV coverage on Versus Network, or modern videos by WCP, this may not be for you. This is more historical footage, but with that you get things you don't get in current TV coverage, mostly the on the ground feel of being with the riders, the sounds, and a timeless feel of cycling.",1236297600,7,897,4.295857988165681
