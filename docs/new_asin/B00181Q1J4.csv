The film seems so authentic, and it is disturbing to know that events like those in Black and White are actually happening in the world.  The plot is captivating and the acting is amazing.  As sad and scary as parts of this film are, in the end the message of hope and faith that people can change makes it very uplifting.",1286841600,,498,4.428571428571429
