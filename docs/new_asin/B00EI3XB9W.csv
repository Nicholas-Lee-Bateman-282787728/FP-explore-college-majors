5915158,5,B00EI3XB9W,"I am so happy to see more of this wonderful series out. I like the old shows. I can not stand swearing and taking the Lords name in vain. This show is holsom and no objectionable terms used. The story lines are interesting and the acting is very good. We need more shows like this, but I doubt those days will ever return. Tv now is just swearing, sex and no story line. I don't watch it at all anymore. The Diagnosis Murder dvds are crisp, good color, good sound and easy to navigate. I don't watch the credits usually. Hope we are regaled with the rest of the series.",1379635200,4,569,4.181818181818182

5915165,5,B00EI3XB9W,"Been waiting a long time for the release of this series, but well worth the wait.  Please refer to my review of Season 5, part 2.  Dick Van Dyke and the cast can do no wrong to bring the kind of enjoyment, humor, and great mystery stories that keep you entertained and wanting more.
Saw these years ago when they ran on TV, and if you saw and liked them then, you'll love having the opportunity to watch them again and having them in your library.",1381795200,,447,4.186046511627907

5915168,5,B00EI3XB9W,"A wonderful heart warming and intelligent detective series, light years away from the modern preoccupation with cold, dark characters and crewel, sinister and often violent plots.  If you enjoy seeing the best of humanity dealing with the adversities and selfishness that life can throw at one from time to time, then this is the series to watch.  Intelligent, uplifting and highly engaging.",1381190400,3,391,5.290322580645161
8605496,1,B00EI3XB9W,"Very disappointed
I purchased the complete season of Diagnosis Murder a little at a time, once I had all I started watching them. I got to season 4, unwrapped the case as I did the prior to watch and found all disc scored and unwatchable, both parts 1 and 2. So went to season 5 and unwrapped to watch and the same unfortunate disaster, all discs scored and unwatchable. Then went to season 6 and wonderful, it was fine as all other seasons except 4 one and two and 5 one and two, must have been bad years for diagnosis murder. Did REORDER the 4 bad sets to complete the series. Only $60, just a drop in the bucket!!!!!!!! My fault was not for waiting too long to watch but waiting too long to unwrap and inspect. Learned a money waist lesson. Realize it had been way too long to complain about receiving bad product but it was truly a lesson. This series is outstanding and would recommend it to anyone who would like a good sit-down series to watch even more than once. This series has a good story line with drama, comedy and excellent actors. Did purchase all from Amazon and as always shipment and packaging was excellent. The series gets a 5 star rating but the disappointment gets a 1 star rating. Will always recommend Amazon for everything.",1522368000,,1249,4.411255411255412
8605497,4,B00EI3XB9W,"Season five of Diagnosis Murder part one features a host of former TV stars including the incomparable Patrick Macnee of The Avengers.  Randolph Mantooth, Robert Fuller, Robert Culp, Barbara Bain, and Peter Graves were also put to good use.  But.  This season also wasted another episode (A Mime is a Terrible Thing to Waste) on a pilot for a proposed series that was never made.  And there are more nose jokes at the expense of Dick Van Dyke.
Very entertaining.",1511481600,,462,4.7375
