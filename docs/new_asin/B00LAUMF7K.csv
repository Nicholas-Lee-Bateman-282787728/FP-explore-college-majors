8664893,3,B00LAUMF7K,"A better collection of films than ""Female Comediennes"", and not cropped as severely as the former, but ""Women in Silent Comedy still suffers from poor un-restored prints that are run at too fast a speed with the accompanying music unrelated to events onscreen.  You have to forgive the prints, though, as we've lost 90% of the silent films ever made but, if your exposure to silent films is only based on low-budget prints like these, I can see why there's not more interest.",1454025600,,475,4.72289156626506

It's truly sad indeed that most silent comediennes are now virtually forgotten. Hadn't been for their collaboration with Lloyd, Chaplin, Arbuckle, Keaton and others, most of their names would probably be totally unknown to most people, even to the occasional silent film fan, not to mention the general public. The fact that there are two volumes devoted to ladies in silent comedy released by the Alpha company is certainly something to commend and congratulate, even if this one, the second, includes only five -unrestored- shorts. Anyway, I'd say it's a good start and let's hope they'll continue releasing more volumes in a near future.

Well, let's talk about the content. At least for me, the highlight of this release is the comedy short starred by the ever wonderful Leatrice Joy, made in 1917 and which is supposed to be the earliest work of hers that survives. It's very simple and funny if you're in the right mood and not very ""exquisite"" regarding comedy, and she's always truly delightful to watch in anything. The print quality is rather good and the historical value of this early work of Ms. Joy alone makes this DVD worth purchasing. But there's more...

Next, we have the always delightful Mabel Normand, a very underrated comedy genius, IMHO. Her 1915 short (""Mabel Lost and Won"") is one of the two here that are quite blurry and kind of difficult to watch. Anyway, not impossible either unless you're extremely picky. The other one with bad print quality (""A Lady"", 1915) is not really starred by a woman, but by Chaplin dressed as one in the last part; however, it's co-starred by the wonderful Edna Purviance, whose radiant smile always lights up the screen and whose talent and legacy are yet to be fairly recognized.

The fourth short is not starred by a woman either, but it features the great Gale Henry, and she has an essential role in it. Even though she's not on screen all the time, the few minutes we get to see her are priceless. Besides, she plays the ever juicy role of a cranky landlady, and is simply hilarious! ""What! No Spinach?"" is actually starred by Harry Sweet, but Ms. Henry totally stole the show. A very nice print quality in this one, too.

The fifth short is starred by The Sennett Bathing Beauties, but the one who really stands out is the charming and super-funny Daphne Pollard, who was just amazing at slaptstick. ""Love at the First Flight"" is a late silent, from 1928, and perhaps the one with the best print quality on the disc.

The only complaint I have about this mini-collection is the inclusion of the aforementioned Chaplin short as a bonus, instead of another one actually starred by a woman. He's always funny, or course; however, given that this set is called ""Women in Silent Comedy"", it would have been more appropriate another one with Gale Henry, Alice Howell, Louise Fazenda or any other instead, since there are sooo many DVD and Blu-ray sets devoted to Chaplin already (BTW, a boxed-set devoted to the great Mabel Normand is much needed and long overdue!), whereas the work of these remarkable ladies is very hard to find. Hopefully, Alpha has a few more stuff in their vaults and will release them eventually. These wonderful pioneers of comedy are more than deserving of such honor.",1419033600,5,3396,4.7572156196943975
