1883385,4,B00009KNZU,"If you like fast cars, cheesy stories and dry humor- buy this movie! I know there are some bad reviews about this film, but hey- what can I say? I like it...",1415232000,,157,3.9375
1883386,2,B00009KNZU,"Wow, what a terrible movie.  However, a friend and I wanted this movie because we caught it late night on tv and had to be able to see it again for the sheer amusement.  When I say ""amusement,"" I'm not talking about the kind you'd experience from Star Wars or Jurassic Park or the like.  I'm talking about the kind you'd get from watching an ill-cast, poorly written, horrbly filmed piece of junk concerned with a so-called sport that nobody knows or cares about.  Billy Zane's wardrobe is foolish.  Large aviator glasses, a knitted yarn scarf and huge 80's style headphones.  Pathetic.  But hey, William Zabka has a cameo.  He's the kid from the evil dojo who wants to creamate Daniel San in the original Karate Kid.  What more could you ask for.  Well, maybe a shotgun for after the movie.",1284768000,,791,4.546099290780142
1883387,5,B00009KNZU,I looked everywhere for this movie. I saw it on the pay channels on cable every now and then and then looked for it on DVD. I couldn't find it anyhwere. I always bought from Amazon since the product base widened. I finally found it and could not be any happier with my purchase. Love you Amazon.com.,1266710400,2,299,4.2631578947368425
1883388,1,B00009KNZU,"The times Hollywood has got any movie having anything to do with cars right are so few and far between that you barely need the fingers of your second hand to count them.

I was excited when I learned they were making an LSR movie, but my feelings of trepidation over Hollywood trying to depict car culture again were more than well-founded.

The technical advisor (if any), would do better to open a dry-cleaner. The script-writer should be tied-up while Craig Breedlove beats the idea of ever writing another car story out of him. The director deserves to be haunted by the ghosts of Art Arfons, Sir Malcolm Campbell and oh, Mickey Thompson.

LSR racing is a fascinating pursuit populated with fascinating characters. It could make a wonderful story if it were done right.

There were some actors-such as Billy Zane, who could have really done something worthwhile here if given a decent script and direction.

On the level of mindless entertainment, I suppose it is passable. However, I imagine that any afficionados of this discipline of racing would join me in thanking Hollywood for making such a ridiculous, steaming pile of a movie.",1255996800,,1140,4.855670103092783
1883389,5,B00009KNZU,"I bought this movie for my mother who looks Billy Zane.  It's hiliarious.  What better time do you have with hot guys and fast cars?!  Not a bad combination in my book.  Yes it can be cheesy at some parts, but those parts are few and far between.",1238025600,2,246,4.0625
1883390,3,B00009KNZU,"This was a very good movie. Billy Zane's witty humor along with his knowledge of cars makes this movie very enjoyable. Get this flick if you like cars high speeds (Mach 2), and humorous insight overall. -BIG TRU",1090800000,4,211,4.578947368421052
1883391,3,B00009KNZU,"It's an unbelievable movie. I mean it literally.
The final drag race scene is totally impossible. The two supersonic cars will interfere each other. They will surely kill each other during the race. Maybe even before they reach mach 1.
This movie is totally a non-sense. The rocket cars are beautiful. The stripper girl in wonder woman bra looks great. But the plot is cheesy and its rocket science, well, [phooey].",1030233600,3,415,4.859154929577465
7990930,5,B00009KNZU,"LOL, bough this because a LOVED one was an EXTRA during the desert cash scene ^_^",1516233600,,81,4.125
7990931,5,B00009KNZU,"Oh the sub woofer channel is really cool if you have +36 DB equalizer present when they hit the gas.
I even had to put silicon on the bookcase to stop the discoloration of sound.",1510531200,,178,4.114285714285714
7990932,5,B00009KNZU,Great car movie even though there are no car chases. The idea of going Mock 2 in a car is awesome!,1472774400,,98,3.7142857142857144
7990933,5,B00009KNZU,Awesome movie I constantly watch it looked for this movie for 20 years,1466985600,,70,4.461538461538462
7990934,4,B00009KNZU,"I saw this movie one time before but I have to say when ever I watch a movie on prime, it has been giving be a lot of problems to stay connected. It says the speed of my internet is not fast enough so it did not allow me to watch this movie again. It also happens a lot with other movies as well. So because I saw the movie before about two years ago . So I give the movie four stars but the service a one Star.  I also have another streaming video site I use and have never had any issues.",1457913600,,490,3.7115384615384617
7990935,5,B00009KNZU,"I know followers of land speed racing didn't care for this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know it's ""Hollywoodized"" but it's still a fun movie.  I got my dvd in goodly time and will enjoy it for a long time to come.",1456099200,,218,4.069767441860465
7990936,5,B00009KNZU,good,1439596800,,4,4.0
7990937,5,B00009KNZU,Great movie you must see it,1435536000,,27,3.6666666666666665
7990938,4,B00009KNZU,"This is a fun and entertaining movie; I watch it every once in a while just for the great one-liners. The cast is great too, down to the last actor; Ray Wise and beautiful Pamela Gidley do a great job. Billy Zane is hilarious and believable as the pilot of the Demon Thrust.  The only thing I would change in this movie; my favorite character, Captain Steve (Scott Wiper) would be a Navy pilot.",1432944000,,394,4.324324324324325
7990939,5,B00009KNZU,Gotta love racing and a lot of speed to enjoy this genre.  A good read.,1430438400,,71,3.7333333333333334
