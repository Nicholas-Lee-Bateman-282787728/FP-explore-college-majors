2886350,2,B000SK5Z2K,"I like stupid movies and I like the stars of this film. 'Wieners is just stupid enough to keep those who enjoy these mindless crude humor films interested, but it is ultimately forgettable. If you like fast food fun films try Kenan Thompson's 'Good Burger' instead. It's funnier that this film and I'll take a burger over a ""wiener"" any day of the week! ;-b",1304899200,,357,4.507692307692308
2886351,5,B000SK5Z2K,"This movie is hilarious. I actually was thinking it was going to be stupid but I seriously laughed my butt off watching it and movies like this one usually don't make me laugh, they usually make me disgusted. But this was actually funny, and not so distasteful that I was disgusted by the content. All in all, Zachary Levi was perfection as always. He just has a way of making every scene he is in seem completely organic. He holds the entire movie together.",1277164800,2,458,4.464285714285714

2886354,4,B000SK5Z2K,"Wieners Rating 3 out of 4 stars

While the idea of three men taking a road trip in a Wienermobile may not sound all that appealing, there's more than rubber meeting the road and mustard meeting the meat in this surprisingly funny effort featuring Fran Kranz, Kenan Thompson and Zachary Levi.

After being humiliated by a Dr. Phil-styled TV shrink, Joel (Kranz) decides he's going to get even. With his buddies by his side, they venture off with a quest for justice, but find it's not easy to make people listen when there's a giant wiener in the picture. Definitely stupid, but thanks to some sweet buddy moments, this movie steers away from the typically silly genre moments and finds some original flavour.

DVD features are sadly lacking on this disc, but there is a Thai dub -- in addition to Spanish, French and Portuguese ones.",1212883200,2,833,4.691780821917808
2886355,4,B000SK5Z2K,"This is your basic straight to DVD stupid comedy but it is a good little stupid comedy. Three buddies drive a wienermobile cross-country to get one of them out of a serious depression.
The jokes are fresh and do not get milked which is why I think it is a nice little movie.
Fans of Jenna McCarthy will be disappointed as she only appears in one scene and it is the lowpoint of the film.
The R rating is for ""offensive language"" and occasional partial nudity.
Aside from McCarthy the weak point is the finale gets stretched out a bit too much.
This is not Animal House caliber but better than all the other National Lampoon stuff",1211932800,4,629,4.384615384615385

8205584,4,B000SK5Z2K,"Very funny movie.  Surprised not many people have heard of it.  Keenan Thompson is believable as a driver of a wiener mobile.  Jenny McCarthy is not in it very much, but she steals the show with the scenes she has.",1345766400,,214,4.3
8205585,4,B000SK5Z2K,The best thing about this silly-but-fun movie is ZACHARY LEVI--this actor is so likeable and full of GoodCheer; he brightens whatever film he's in. This one was made before he did the memorable TV series CHUCK.,1341273600,,210,4.861111111111111
