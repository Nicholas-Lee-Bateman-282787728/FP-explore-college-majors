Going Bye-Bye
Scram
Another Fine Mess
One Good Turn
All of these are good, you will not be disappointed with any of them.

Going Bye-Bye was always one of my favorites. The boys are on the run from a convict who wants to get even with them for testifing
against him. L&H are always at their comedic best when in trouble.

In Scram the boys have a run in with a judge who has absolutely no sense of humor.

Another Fine Mess is a talking remake of one of their early silent short films, Duck Soup. And in this case the remake is really
much better than the original. The boys are a couple of bums on the run from the cops for vagrancy. They hide out in a high
class mansion.

In One Good Turn the boys are down on their luck again. They decide they have to help out a nice old lady who gave them a meal.
This one has a good twist in it as Stan, who generally accepts being pushed around by Ollie, turns the tables on him.

You can`t go wrong with Laurel & Hardy. It`s non-stop laughs.",1261872000,4,1027,4.064356435643564
7819785,4,6302033292,"ON THE LAM features four of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's HAL ROACH sound era slapstick shorts. In the majority of these, our heroes portray vagrants or men down-on-their-luck.

SYNOPSES:

ANOTHER FINE MESS--  Based on an English music hall sketch written by Stan's father. Here, the boys are homeless fugitives from the law who occupy a temporarily vacant mansion. When potential renters arrive, Ollie masquerades as the homeowner, big game hunter Col. Buckshot, and Stan assumes the identities of both butler and maid. Co-stars Thelma Todd, who died mysteriously and tragically at the age of 30.

GOING BYE-BYE!--  An escaped convict seeks revenge on L & H for their part in sending him to prison. The bad guy's girlfriend (Mae Busch) is in on his plans.

ONE GOOD TURN--  After cadging a meal from a kind-hearted old lady, the boys overhear the woman and Jimmy Finlayson rehearsing a play. Thinking that Finlayson's an evil landlord who's going to evict their benefactress for not paying the mortgage, they auction off their flivver to help her.

SCRAM!--  After they're ordered by a judge to leave town, our unemployed and address-free friends are invited by a wealthy tippler to stay at his mansion. When their drunken host can't find his key, the boys figure a way into the house, which turns out to be the residence of the very same judge they've just faced in court.
