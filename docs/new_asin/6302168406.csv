From the opening song: ""Gimme, Gimme, Gimme"" to the closing credits, this is what a perfect little Christmas TV show looks like.
The sentiment of the holidays is captured, and everything that Christmas is about is here.
Light the fire, pop in the tape, (no DVD yet) and curl up with someone you love.
Merry Christmas",1008720000,2,370,4.707692307692308

The comedy is great  and it brings out Jim Davis's true Christmas talent. If you by a video for  your children, this is the one. In it, Garfield, Odie and Jon go to visit  his parents for a snowy holiday. I won't ruin the rest of the movie for you  but, this should be a holiday tradition for your entire family.",965692800,2,441,4.0813953488372094

434988,5,6302168406,"I've always been a big Garfield fan and so was a lot of other people of all ages. A Garfield Christmas special aired in 1987 when I was a six-year-old. The plot involved Jon dragging Garfield and Odie to his family's farm for Christmas, where Garfield learns the true meaning of giving. It aired annually on CBS for many years, but has now disappeared from television. Thankfully, all of the Garfield specials have been released to DVD for old and new fans to watch again and again.",1355184000,,482,4.551724137931035

It was hard to find DVD but once I did, I grabbed it. Even though this DVD was an import, it played great and picture quiality was excellant. The movie is still funny with heartfelt moments that really get to you. It's a wonderful movie to share with your family and family time is precious.

I had it shipped regular mail and it stated it could take up to 14 days and it only took 3. I was like a kid on Christmas morning when I got. We watched it that night with our son and two necies and the smile did not leave our face. I saw a review on here about the picture quality which I thought was fine. Remeber, the movie was made in 1987!!! Great value and speedie delivery! Thanks for making Christmas a blast!",1353801600,,593,3.8292682926829267
435021,5,6302168406,"I was so happy to find A Garfield Christmas story on Amazon. I remember watching this cartoon when it first aired in 1987.

435022,5,6302168406,"This 5-star rating is because the recipient of this Christmas gift loves it.

My wife had been looking on store shelves for WEEKS for this, so I decided to go online and get it for her for Christmas.  Boy did that ever go over well!  She remembers this from her childhood, so I sat and watched it with her for her sake.  The content itself is not my style, but for nostalgia purposes it was perfect for her!",1329868800,,407,4.17948717948718

The picture was very jumpy which was very distracting!  I would never buy from this seller again!!!  If not for the fact it is the recipients favorite, I would have returned it.  It looked like it was recorded from the TV with a hand held camcorder. ",1326758400,,383,4.478260869565218
435024,4,6302168406,My wife and I had video taped this show for our children when it was first on TV. Needless to say thru the years the quality of the tape was not holding up. We received the dvd and we were thrilled! Digital quality and best of all no commercials! Also included on the dvd was a thanksgiving show we had never seen before. It brought back good memories as we watched Garfields christmas once again with our children!,1326153600,,415,4.333333333333333
435025,5,6302168406,This was one of my favorite Christmas movies as a child but sadly it is no longer aired on TV anymore.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  It is the same great Garfield that I remember watching as a child.  My daughter who is not quite 2 liked watching the kitty on tv :),1323820800,7,273,3.754385964912281

435027,5,6302168406,I LOVE this special. I would buy at least 2 copies of it b/c I'm sure my brother would need one too. My kids would love it & I want to add it to my small collection of fun Christmas movies that 'mommy watched when she was little too!' :),1260835200,,237,3.76
435028,3,6302168406,"I remembered watching this movie as a child so I decided to get it. It's not quite like I remembered, there are a lot of songs sung in this movie, which it definitely not my thing. It could be compared to a bad disney sequel, however, I still love how John and his brother try to get their dad to let them open presents at midnight, because technically it's the 25th. My favorite parts are usually revolved around Odie, especially when he makes the back scratcher for Garfield.",1165449600,,477,4.431818181818182
435071,5,6302168406,"As another reviewer pointed out, this wonderful special is now on DVD under the name of Garfield's Holiday Celebrations which collect a Garfield Halloween, Thankgiving, and Christmas into one great DVD.  Awesome because this is a very good special that up until last year you could only see if you happened to find a copy on VHS somewhere.

A Garfield Christmas was first shown in 1987. Garfield, Odie and Jon spend a family Christmas at the farm home where Jon grew up and with his family. It's funny because Garfield is his usual crabby self until the Christmas spirit finally grabs him.  Fun songs as well.  A great special.  Definietely get the DVD!",1127865600,13,653,4.743362831858407
435072,5,6302168406,"I noticed that many of you seem sad about not being able to find this movie.  I noticed that it is on a DVD called ""Garfield Holiday Celebrations (1985)""  I just found it here on AMAZON.  I hope this is helpful for all of you. I know I looked for a long time.",1124841600,,259,3.849056603773585
435073,5,6302168406,"Needless to say, this Garfield special is a great one.  There is no need to go into details.  If you are a fan of Garfield and/or quality, ""feel-good"" holiday specials, this is most definitely for you.  It is such a great memory from my childhood (I'm 23 now), and it pains me that there is no way to acquire a new version of it.  It is rarely shown on TV anymore, and I miss it.  The video/DVD distribution is *not* handled by Tremendous! Entertainment (as was stated previously), but rather by Fox Television.  I wrote to Tremendous!, and they notified me of this.  I am now begging Fox to re-release it, hopefully on DVD.  I'd encourage all of you Garfield fans out there to write to Fox and express your interest as well.  Hopefully I'll be able to find my ratty old taped-from-tv copy of this one as the Christmas season draws nearer.  Christmas just wouldn't be the same without it.",1067299200,6,888,4.459627329192546
435074,5,6302168406,"I am 20 years old and my mom taped this for me when I was about 4.  This tape has been viewed at least 20 times per Christmas every single year.  I adore Garfield, my whole bedroom theme is Garfield along with every Garfield comic book and movie.  This one is one that truly warms the heart.  Garfield can make anyone laugh with his grumpy sarcasm and adoration for harrassing dogs and teasing Jon, but it will warm your heart to see the grumpiest cat turn into the worlds biggest softie.  I love to see Garfield so happy and loving.  He's so sweet to befriend Gramma, and give her a Christmas gift, and to hug Odie.  I always tear up seeing him and Odie dancing at the end! This is the cutest movie ever made, and it's a family tradition to watch it.  I even have my 6 year old niece addicted to Garfield now! This one brings the holiday spirit every time.",1065830400,7,857,4.214723926380368
435075,5,6302168406,"I think everybody knows this has got to be one of the most beloved christmas specials ever produced..  Additionally, other gafield specials like the great Garfield's Halloween Adventure and Garfield In the Rough are equally fun.  Its such a shame that these great specials have been out of print for so very long...  BUT- Tremendous! Entertainment in Minnesota has just purchased the rights to all of these specials, as well as the great, long running ""Garfield and Friends"" TV series... we can hopefully someday curl up on the couch with a loved one at christmas time and see A Garfield Christmas on DVD.  But until then, we must be content with the beat-up VHS copies that we all have.",1062633600,8,687,4.7478991596638656
435076,5,6302168406,"I have to say I loved this movie, not only because I love Garfield, but in addition to that I loved how they portrayed Garfield with a loving nature. He listened to John's grandma's beautiful memories and gave her one of the sweetest Christmas presents. He actually became a closer friend to his pal Odie and gave him a loving gift from the heart. It was so nice to see my favorite grumpy cat have such a big heart. His friendly relationship with Odie at the end was so sweet that I cried. I loved this movie. It is a perfect and special Christmas movie about the spirit of giving from your heart and forgetting about the material aspects of life!",1052006400,6,647,4.355371900826446
435077,5,6302168406,"""A Garfield Christmas"" is a treasureable Christmas animated film that should be enjoyed by kids everywhere. Garfield has really lost a lot of his popularity. The current sales rank of this video shows why. It shouldn't be that way! I love Garfield and so should everyone else. He's a fat cat, but a cute one at that. This is something that is unlike any other Garfield program. It toches your heart at times. Merry Christmas!",1039824000,,425,4.68

Garfield is so funny in this special. Which is one reason that it is so good.

For some reason, they don't run it anymore on TV so I ordered the DVD for my family and I to add to our Christmas collection. The DVD seems to be a burned DVD-R disc on demand offered by Amazon.com even though it does not say that it is.
