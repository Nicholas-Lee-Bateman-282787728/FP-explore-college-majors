8610921,1,B001QA4VE4,Terribly instructed video. Seems like the video has been sliced together. She acts like she has introduced some moves when she hasnt. She skips moves altogether sometimes. Just really frustrating.,1530230400,,196,5.566666666666666
8610922,2,B001QA4VE4,The dvd is great in regards to its high intensity but the instrcutor does not allow you time to learn new steps. She practically introduces a new step..you do it twice and then she adds on to it. If she allowed more time to learn the steps it would be great. Also it doesnt help that the camera shows feet and the back of the participatnts backs and necks when you are in the middle of trying to look at the screen and listen for ques on the new steps introduced to be learned in less than one minute. I just got it in the mail today and am looking on how to send it back for another dvd!,1275436800,,588,3.9495798319327733
8610923,3,B001QA4VE4,"This video is very hard in that the instructor does not allow any time to show you the new steps.  I have taken Step Classes for years and have several Reebok videos and this DVD has steps I have never seen.  They do not look difficult to do, but they are complicated and if you are not given any instruction or time to learn them, it is frustrating to use.  I actually have only used the video one time, and I stopped it after about 15 minutes and put in different one.  As of yet, I have not had the time to keep stopping and starting and rewinding to watch these new steps slowly so I can learn them.",1235433600,2,603,4.042016806722689
