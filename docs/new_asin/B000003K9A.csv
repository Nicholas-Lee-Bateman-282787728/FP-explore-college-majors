7903016,5,B000003K9A,"This is definitely one of the finest DS-9 episodes - and there are a LOT of DS-9 episodes to choose from that were wonderful.  This episode was beautifully written, poignantly directed, and features superb performances by Nana Visitor and Rene Auberjonois.  The ending is surprising, effective, and heart-breaking, all at the same time.  If you are a DS-9 fan, this episode belongs in your collection.",1030752000,,401,5.138461538461539
7903017,5,B000003K9A,"I'll spare you another synopsis (you can just read the ones below).  But it's a wonderful episode...to me, it is on my list of the Top 5.  For those of you who love Odo & Kira the way I do, this episode is a biggie--it directs their ""close"" friendship to a certain path. The ending is shocking...but it leaves a huge mark.  If you loved watching them in ""Crossfire,"" then you want to see this one!",1026172800,,397,4.197368421052632
7903018,4,B000003K9A,"Deep Space Nine will largely be remembered, at least by me, for the grand and sweeping epic that comprised its entire last season, and with good reason.  However, one sometimes had to do some digging around in there for the character stuff (not to say it wasn't there-- it was-- but it was often secondary in importance).  In this episode, however, there's no connection to the over-arching plot and no giant space battles, and so we get to see the characters in a very unique situation (well, not entirely unique on Star Trek, but still unusal).  They get to meet their descendants.  Furthermore, they are forced to choose between erasing those people from the timeline and getting home themselves.  They know that some of them, including Kira, will die in the crash, and the rest will never see their families again.  But they don't have the right to deny their descendants existence.  The ""version"" of Odo who has lived on the planet for 200 years is a very compelling character, especially as a tragic lover.  Overall, this is one of my favorite single DS9 episodes, and it can be watched on its own-- whereas the last 7 or 10 episodes, while forming an extremely exciting plot, really do all have to be watched in order to see that plot.  So unless you're up to the daunting task of collecting the entire Dominion War, this episode (along with the comic classics ""Little Green Men"" and ""Trials and Tribble-ations"") should be at the top of your list.",984787200,,1454,4.670588235294118
7903019,2,B000003K9A,"In a strange temporal anomaly the Defiant lands on a planet that is populated with their descendents, Sisko realises that this planet is  somehow out of loop with the rest of time and that they are in the future  and that the reason these descendents are alive is that the Defiant was  trapped on the planet decades earlier and never escaped, with all the  original crew dead, except for Odo, the crew face a difficult situation: if  they leave the planet then the crew will not pro-create with each other and  create the descendents they see before them. In effect they will be killing  their descendents, even though they haven't been born in their time.  Confusing - well not when it is explained to you with the magic of TV, but  slow, YES. Not much happens except a lot of bonding with the crews  relatives-to-be. A bit boring especially as we all know the ending, the  Defiant IS going to leave and thus ensuring that the descendents never  exist. Well we never liked them anyway...",966729600,,988,4.582857142857143
7903020,5,B000003K9A,"The Defiant crash lands Sisko, Dax, Worf, Kira, O'Brien, Odo and its crew on a planet inhabited by their descendants.  If the DS9 crew leaves the planet and returns to their own time/space continuum, the planet's hundreds  of inhabitants, their descendants will have never existed - in other words,  they will die.  If the crew does not return, they will be forced to live  their lives on this planet and Kira will die.  I do the plot no justice by  over-simplifying it, thusly.  This has to be the finest episode of Deep  Space Nine ever made and ranks up there with City on the Edge of Forever as  a classic.  I do not want to give anything away, but the decision the crew  finally agree upon is agonizingly dramatic.  The ending, however, is quite  the twisted surprise.  This episode provides great acting by the ensemble  cast (even Avery Brooks!) and one killer of a script by Gary Holland and  Ethan H. Calk.  Enjoy!  Buy two copies and give the second as a gift.  Seriously...",963273600,,984,4.545977011494253
