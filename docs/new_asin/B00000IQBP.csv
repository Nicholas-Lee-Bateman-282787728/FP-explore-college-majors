1227659,5,B00000IQBP,"The first muppet film directed by the man himself JIM HENSON we see our heroes kermit,fozzie and gonzo head to london to solve a spate of jewell robberies.  The film is well cast the stars are great but its the muppets who steal every scene the musical numbers are superb the puppeteering is flawless the on screen muppet effects e.g the bicycle scene are a work of sheere genius. Any muppet fan worth their salt will already own this film on VHS as i do but the DVD edition should be far supperior with those new muppetisms etc. As a puppeteer and puppetmaker myself the muppets are at their visual best esspecially miss piggy who has changed dramatically over the last few years,this was when the muppets were at the height of their popularity and that comes accross in the finished movie.  If you haven't seen this film you owe it to yourself to purchase this DVD,If you have seen the movie however buy it amyway....",989539200,5,919,4.530120481927711
1227660,3,B00000IQBP,"While the Cameos are great and the performances by Miss piggy and Kermit are wonderful, the movie strikes as slow and adverage.  Although it's very funny and the musical numbers are a riot, it doesn't live up to the processor, ""The Muppet Movie"".  Charles Gordin is I have to admit, is hilarious as the Jewel theif who woos Piggy.  Miss Piggy is pretty much the main charecter in this instead of Kermit and Fozzie the Bear.  At least it isn't as bad as ""Muppet's take Mannhatain""!",982108800,,480,4.546511627906977
1227661,5,B00000IQBP,"The Muppets go to London?  Perfect situation!  Where else are you going to take them to solve the greatest crime of the 20th century:Who stole Lady Holiday (Diana Rigg)'s diamonds?  Throw in a very suave Charles Grodin, and  a very hilarious cameo by John Cleese, and you have one of the best Muppet  films ever made!  See it if you haven't!",945302400,3,341,4.508196721311475
1227662,5,B00000IQBP,"This is definitely one of Hensons best works.  I have watched it scads of times.  For the love of pete, it is darn right halarious, you have to see it!  Animal is halariousn as well as the rest of the muppet band and crew.",932947200,,222,4.0
1227663,5,B00000IQBP,"Any movie that features the Muppet gang is going to be great, but the ones produced while Jim was still below the scenes are the best.  This movie has so many wonderful moments -- the background nonsense during ""Hey, a  movie!"", Gonzo's demonstration of how to hail a cab, Statler and  Waldorf's heckling, the way people can't tell Kermit and Fozzy apart, and a  hilarious cameo by Peter Falk...just to name a few.  And it even has  Charles Grodin before he became a boring late night talk show host.  Terrific fun!",927244800,14,515,4.593406593406593

1227677,5,B00000IQBP,My absolute favorite Muppet movie. No problems with the DVD.,1491955200,,60,5.1
1227678,5,B00000IQBP,"Personally, what makes this Muppet movie my favorite is Kermit's not so bossy like he usually is and he's more respectable and cautious about what he says. For example in the scene after Bo drives them back to the hotel and asks how he gets out of there, Kermit politely says, ""I suggest you make a U-turn."" Whereas if this had been a scene in the first film, Kermit probably would of shouted out, ""Just get out of here!""
Second what I love about it is Kermit has just as much love and passion for Miss Piggy as she does for him. And more so, Miss Piggy's not so overly obsessed with Kermit and smothering him like she usually does. She allows Kermit his space so he can breathe and come to terms with his feelings too; in spite of the fact that he feels angry and betrayed by her lying to him about being Lady Holiday. But sure enough she comes clean and he's able to go on loving her. The music and songs I think are wonderful and composed by just the right man. JOE RAPOSO! So if you want to see a great Muppet film that continues to delight more generations of children and adults alike, this is the one for you. Rent a copy or watch the Great Muppet Caper on TV. And if you connect deeply with it, by all means, buy your copy here. I promise you won't regret it!!",1488672000,2,1268,4.158536585365853

He is now 17 months old, and we reach for the Great Muppet Caper during crisis situations like long plane trips, extensive car rides, or teething. The movie itself is cute in its 1980's dress and humor, and there is a vein of subtle humor that adults will catch when watching it with their little ones.

1227765,5,B00000IQBP,"I first heard of ""The Great Muppet Caper"" on an IMDB board post that I read about ""Muppets Most Wanted."" From that talk board post on IMDB, I learned from the person (name unknown) that the false arrest and imprisonment of Kermit the Frog in ""Muppets Most Wanted"" was daunting enough to remind him or her of what happened to Miss Piggy in London, England a long time ago in the ""Muppet Caper"" story. At that moment, I learned from that IMDB post last year that in ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" Miss Piggy was falsely accused of stealing a valuable necklace from Lady Holliday when Piggy knew she didn't do it. Then, I learned the real suspects that did it were the victim's impulsive brother, Nick, and his three toadying witches Carla, Darla, and Marla. Since I first saw that review post of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" on IMDB and learned of Miss Piggy's false arrest in ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" these two Muppets films that relate a bit to truth and justice, I've imagined Kermit and Piggy appearing on Oprah Winfrey's show and becoming healing voices for people who were once wronged but healing. Plus, I've fantasized the Muppets' case against Constantine, the bad, mean frog in ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" going to public trial, myself as the prosecutor assigned to the case, seriously believing Kermit and Piggy when they testify, and myself consoling Piggy when those awful, repressed memories of her false arrest in England come to her. I hope some day to try ""The Great Muppet Caper."" Just like Kermit the Frog is, Miss Piggy is also innocent. Believe it or not, Miss Piggy is innocent everyone ! ! ! :)",1424822400,,1599,4.673758865248227

1227896,4,B00000IQBP,"I do absolutely love The Muppets.  They represent a time of pure innocence and adolescence and give me this crisp sense of nostalgia that I cant help but gravitate towards.  I love being wrapped in that security blanket so-to-speak.

It feels cozy.

Introducing my children to The Muppets was made rather easy thanks to the 2011 film, but having them fall in love with the characters and the earlier films, which I grew up on, is an even greater joy.  Nestling onto the couch to watch The Muppets Treasure Island or The Great Muppet Caper is a feeling I cant really describe.

Joy, it feels like real joy.

The Great Muppet Caper is a fun one to introduce to your children because it has so many little hints at what make The Muppets so spectacular.  The sly remarks, the complete awareness, the unashamed corn, the manic editing and those cameos!  I do wish that the songs were a little more thought out, because some of them are sort of stale and could have used some freshness, but the overall tone of the film is too good to ignore.

The plot revolves around Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo who travel to England to track down a jewel thief.  Kermit meets and falls for a secretary posing as the victim of the thieves and winds up defending her when she is framed for the robbery.  The Kermit/Piggy love angle is glorious, the musical numbers (despite having lackluster songs) are exquisite and the visual effects are just so much fun (and played up for the fun as well).  It isn't the strongest film in The Muppet canon, but it is certainly worth a gander and one that your children will openly adore.",1389052800,,1599,4.510416666666667

1227928,3,B00000IQBP,"I love the Muppets, but that love has its limits.  The Muppet Movie, is beautiful, lovely and a classic.  The Great Muppet Caper is the beginning of the end, in my opinion, of the Muppet movies.  (As of this review, I have not seen the latest, THE MUPPETS)  Caper ups the production values but looses the heart of its predecessor.  We have a few cameos, but everything feels very forced, much like every musical number.  I've seen this movie several times, and each time I return with the same self inflicted amnesia that protects me from the memory of exactly how un-good it really is.  I can't even admit it's just a plain bad film, ""un-good"" is the best I can muster.  The gist is I can't adhere to my own advice and once every five years or so I return to this water hole only to come up dry each and every time.  So if you're like me and are a bit a masochist when it comes to this film, you'll LISTEN TO ME and just stay away.  Do yourself a favor and just go watch the first film again and be happy, or face the consequences of a post-film melancholy that descends shortly after the first big song and dance number begins.

Not only is the film very grainy, it also appears that the video has horrible compression. I can't believe that any company would put out such a poor quality product and place thier name on it.

I also own The Muppet Movie (1979) and the quality is decent, which makes it puzzling as to why a movie released 2 years later (1981) is of much lesser quality. It's almost like they grabbed an old VHS copy, transferred it, added a menu and threw it on a DVD.

Hopefully Disney's quick-and-cheap to market strategy earned them enough money over the years to focus on putting cleaner improved copies out there as titles are released on Blu-Ray.

There's no way this movie came from something other than a multi-generation copy of the original. If you didn't get enough grain in your diet, pick this one up you'll be good for life.

1228097,5,B00000IQBP,"I purchased the 50th anniversary edition to replace my VHS copy of this movie, so this review comes out of my memory of this move.  I grew up with the Muppets and saw all of their movies first in the theaters (sometimes multiple times), then VHS, and slowly getting them in DVD.  Out of all of the Muppet moview, this is their best. The entire movie really is a salute, from a Muppet perspective, towards all of the fun, romantic 1940's musicals that were produced in the Golden Era of Hollywood.  Kermit and Fozzie are twin brothers working a newspaper beat trying to catch a jewel thief and follow the trail to London-flying in the cargo hold of the plane with the other animals-to interview Lady Holiday about her stolen jewels.  The evening at the supper club that breaks out into a 1940's style big song and dance number featuring Ms. Piggy, of course, is one of many special moments of this film.  I believe Jim Henson is one of the patrons at the supper club that gets his picture taken by Fozzie. Charles Grodin as Nicky, the slimy brother of Lady Holiday (Diana Riggs) really is convincing as an ill-fated suitor for Ms. Piggy, as he pursues her in the film, but he is the primary suspect for plotting to steal the Fabulous Baseball Diamond. John Cleese, as well as other well-known actors make their cameo appearances, and this movie is an absolute must for any true Muppet fan, young or old. Given the fact that my 12 year old son can still remember the Baseball Diamond and he's moved on to video games and other things, this movie is a classic Muppet tale that brings out the kid in everyone.",1323734400,,1605,4.482876712328767

1228106,5,B00000IQBP,"I think of all of the Muppet movies, that this one really captures the most what the zaniness of the Muppets is really all about. It's the closest to being crazy like The Muppet Show was. Most Muppet fans will tell you that the original Muppet Movie was the all out classic, and yeah, its good, but this: the second of the films, really works as an all out classic comedy. It's got everything.

First and most importantly they put the rock band to great use... The Electric Mayhem. I still totally dig the Mayhem and I don't know why they never put out an official album. The members of the group get a lot of the best lines in this one, even the unsung ones like Janice and Floyd... and they trash around alot in the Mayhem van, which is totally sweet. Secondly, The Happiness Hotel rules. I wish I could live in a Hotel run by rats, and when pay time came along I had the option of C:""sneakin out in the middle of the night.""

Anyway, heres a quick overview of the plot. Fozzie and Kermit are twin brothers, yeah, I could never tell them apart either... and they work for a newspaper with Gonzo. Right away they blow the hottest story in the press, even though they were the only reporters to actually be on the scene... hey, they were too busy dancing and singing. Ooops. In order to make good with their boss (Jack Warden, perfect!) they go to London to find jewel and fashion diva Lady Holiday for the inside scoop. Miss Piggy has a raging thing for Kermit and pretends to be the famed Lady Holiday, leading our boys off the trail, while meanwhile Charles Grodin and a band of stunning ladies Marla, Carla and Darla, are involved in a scheme to frame Miss Piggy and steal the Baseball Diamond from the Mallory Gallery. By the time the action really starts rising, the jokes and one liners come flowing at a insane pace. You really got to pay attention, because its easy to miss some of the films best dialouge. I guess I can't spoil it for you, but theres like a hundred great lines in this bit. Also a great scene with Peter Faulk on a bench that I like alot. In the end, this movie spawned some bits that would be used again in future Muppet outings, but here is when they were fresh and at their best.  Jim Henson was a straight up genius, and though his company still produces films, they just can't provide the magic that he brought to the table.  I highly recommend this one over all other Muppet movies.",1243468800,2,2415,4.324503311258278

1228126,5,B00000IQBP,"The Great Muppet Caper has a great plot with equally special cameos; and the film moves along at a very good pace. This is one of the stronger Muppet movies with action that keeps your attention and the musical numbers are somewhat reminiscent of those 1940's style Busby Berkeley numbers. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography for scenes like the water ballet is nothing short of superb.

When the film begins, there is this wonderfully beautiful even if all too brief sequence of some of the Muppets flying down to Earth as they ride in hot air balloons. Once they hit the ground, however, they sure do hit the ground running! It seems that Lady Holiday (Diana Rigg) has been robbed of some of her jewels and reporters Fozzie Bear and Kermit The Frog have not covered the story! The editor of their paper, The Chronicle, is furious and fires them all, even photographer Gonzo, for just not being up to par. Nevertheless, Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo think the best way to get their jobs back is to go to England, interview Lady Holiday and maybe even try to solve the mystery of who was the robber.

They fly in ""ninth class"" on an airplane, which is a hysterically funny sequence; and when they get to England all they can afford is the free Happiness Hotel. It's a dump, to be sure, but our friends are happy just to have a roof over their heads. Kermit visits Lady Holiday's office, which she shares with her irresponsible money grubbing brother Nicky Holiday (Charles Grodin), and Kermit mistakes the newly hired secretary Miss Piggy for Lady Holiday. Miss Piggy and Kermit even decide to go out on a date--with a few more of the Muppets tagging along for some great effects.

It isn't long, however, before there's another jewel heist at the supper club where they've been dining; and when Miss Piggy is found with some of Lady Holiday's jewels on her at a fashion show things start to look pretty bad for Piggy. Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest don't think Miss Piggy is the real thief; they want to help her and quickly solve the mystery of just who is the real jewel thief. Time is of the essence because they don't want anyone to steal Lady Holiday's next big jewel, the baseball diamond, which is housed in a museum; and they don't want Miss Piggy to suffer too many negative consequences, either.

What happens to Miss Piggy? Can Kermit and his friends actually do all this and make things right? What if they won't let Piggy out of jail? How can our friends even try to stop the theft of the baseball diamond? No plot spoilers here--watch the film and find out!

The DVD has only one real extra--we get a short featurette about Miss Piggy that isn't really very good. You can choose to see the film in fullscreen or widescreen; but that's about it. The quality of the print could be a little better, too.

The Great Muppet Caper is a fine movie for the entire family to enjoy anytime. The violence is extremely mild and it shouldn't bother small children in my opinion. I highly recommend this film for fans of puppetry as well--Jim Henson and the gang will always be the ""top of the line!""",1234396800,,3117,4.547237076648841

1228159,4,B00000IQBP,"I have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all-time since I was a little girl.  The Great Muppet Caper is one of the rare movies today where you can sit down with your children, laugh, have a good time, and not have to worry about any ""uncomfortable"" moments.  Tons of singing, dancing, and wise-cracks.  This movie is sure to have kids and parents entertained.

So why did I give TGMC only four stars?  It's not the movie per se ... I was just a bit disappointed with picture quality.  Since this DVD is a special ""anniversary edition"" I was hoping it would've been digitally remastered since it had originally only been available on VHS.  In my opinion (I have 2 plasma screen TVs in my home and 1 flat screen) the picture quality is just so-so; it could definitely be better.  Other than that issue, this movie deserves 5 stars!

1228167,5,B00000IQBP,"This is my all time favorite muppet film.  Not saying anything bad about the other ones, which are all very enjoyable.  But this one has it all.  A thrilling ""plot"".  Great characters.  Fun musical numbers.  Some action.  And terrific guest stars.

The muppets have never really gotten their due when it comes to writing.  They've got some brilliant bits in this movie.  Characters often break the Fourth Wall, but it's never overdone.  The scene where Kermit yells at Piggy for overacting is one of the funniest muppet bits ever.

What makes the muppets truly great is that they're real characters.  I know in my head that they're just puppets.  But they've got such consistent, likable personalities that I can't help but see them as people.  People I'd love to know, even if that is technically impossible.

1228168,5,B00000IQBP,"Of all the Muppet movies that I have seen, ""The Great Muppet Caper"" is my personal favorite (next to the original Muppet movie). Although I am thirty years old, I still have a soft spot for Kermit and the gang. The premise of this film has Kermit, Gonzo, and Fozzie make a trip halfway around the world to London to try to cover a story that involved a stolen necklace whose owner happens to be a wealthy fashion designer named Lady Holiday. What happens next is a series of follies and hijinks involving Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy. One of my personal favorite scenes is when Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo checks into their hotel which is a dilapidated hotel where the residents are far from boring and extremely colorful. I absolutely love Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker, Janice (who I think has a fondness for wacky tobaccy), and the Swedish Chef. Another great moment in the film is during the fashion show and Miss Piggy is daydreaming that she was a runaway model and breaks into this whole song and dance routine. I can still watch this movie and still laugh until I am literally crying. I can never tire of The Muppets no matter how old I am.",1096588800,5,1169,4.518867924528302

1228190,4,B00000IQBP,"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Muppets, even as I got older and started watching more ""grown-up"" movies.
Of the three Muppet movies made while Jim Henson was still alive, this was the first one I ever saw, and remains my favorite.  The jokes are hilarious (my favorite being the recurring joke ""We'll catch them red-handed."" ""What color are their hands now?""), and the puppetry is just incredible, especially during the scene where everyone goes for a bike ride.
Unfortunately, I can't give this 5 stars, because I'm not just rating the movie, I'm rating the DVD it's on.  And quite frankly, the DVD stinks.  Even though some bonus features (like on the ""Muppet Movie"" and ""Muppets Take Manhattan"" DVDs) would have been nice, what was REALLY lacking was the picture quality.  The opening scene with Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo in the hot air balloon looked dirty and grainy.  This film seriously needed to be cleaned up before being transferred to DVD.
So while the movie itself is great and gets five stars, I can only give the DVD three.",1081900800,5,1054,4.675675675675675
1228191,4,B00000IQBP,"As I am indulging in all things British at the moment, I wondered how Jim Henson would be at a British murder mystery.  The answer is absolutely fabulous!
In the opening credits, Fozzy complains about how long the credits are taking and says, ""Does anyone even read those names?""  ""Sure,"" replies Kermit, ""they have families.""  From there Henson takes you on a pure romp of fun, finding the humour in the British, in fashion design, in plot development, in seedy hotels, in Columbo, and in the Muppets themselves.  Throughout the film, Henson also plays with the audiences' mind as he breaks down the barrier between the plot and reality.  He was an incredibly clever man!
Also, if you have a favorite among the Muppets, yours will probably have his time in the spotlight.  My favorites are Beaker and the Swedish Chef, and I was not disappointed in them.  However, my appreciation for Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo also grew in this film.  (It's been awhile since I watched the Muppets.)

Daily Chronicle"" trying to find a necklace stolen from Lady Holiday (Diana Rigg) by her brother Nicky (Charles Grodin) and
Marla, Carla and Darla (Erica Creer, Kate Howard, Della Finch).
But at first they think Miss Piggy stole it! There are some funny
parts like when Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo fall in the water and
fall from their hotel room.

1228194,5,B00000IQBP,"I've only seen this movie on a recorded-off-TV format, but this is probably one of the funniest movies you can see (at least with Kermit the Frog in the starring role), and certainly the best Muppet movie, as far as I'm concerned.
The movie begins with Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo in a balloon, floating high above the city, reading the credits as they roll. (""Kermit? What does B.S.C. stand for?"" ""I dunno..."" and ""Nobody really reads these do they?"" ""Well sure they do. They all have families."")
Once the credits finish, the balloon plummets to the street, where the trio introduce the movie with a large song-and-dance number amidst a chaotic street scene, complete with a robbery on set!
The rest of the movie is loads of laughs as Kermit and his friends travel to England for their newspaper to interview Lady Holiday (Diana Rigg). Their Muppet entourage grows when the three book their stay at the Happiness Hotel, a run-down England hotel occupied by a crew of lazy Muppets.
Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Animal, Dr. Teeth and the whole gang eventually team up to foil Lady Holiday's brother (Charles Grodin) and his three partners in crime from stealing the fabulous Baseball Diamond at the Mallory Gallery. It's pure, hilarious, and classic Muppet mayhem.
Kiddos and adults one and all will most likely enjoy this movie, and you don't have to worry about any unclean humor whatsoever.
I'm in my late teens and I still laugh at this movie. Definitely worth the money.",1049500800,31,1478,4.822834645669292
1228195,5,B00000IQBP,"""The Great Muppet Caper"" is not the definative Muppet film (check out ""The Muppet Movie"" [1979] for that distinction) but it is a very solid outing from Kermit and the gang.  The celebrity performances and cameos (even Jim Henson, Muppet creator, shows up) are well-done, with just enough campiness to make them funny for kids, but just enough restraint to keep it interesting for adults.  The bike riding scene in the park is first rate, as is the Esther Williams-style water dancing sequence with Miss Piggy as its star.
In short, this British-influened slice of cinema is more sophisticated than the aforementioned ""Muppet Movie"" and less silly than the subsequent films.  It's a great choice.  Buy it without hesitation.",1030406400,29,724,5.0588235294117645
1228196,5,B00000IQBP,"Only kidding Ester, but the swimming sequence with Miss Piggy to me is worth the whole entire movie. The song is beautiful and the orchestration is powerful and mind blowing and the 5.1 stereo sound with Charles and Kermit battling over for Miss Piggy in that swimming scene gives me goose-flesh every time i watch it. Artistically these muppet movies are a wonderful combination of live people, great props and scenery, lavish costumes, wonderful music and really great story lines. Even at age 54 i find these movies a wonderful escape from hectic days and are just a joy to watch.  Who would ever think ""the muppets"" would endure these several decades.  Jim Henson was a wonderful man and to bad his life was cut so short.",1030060800,15,725,4.700787401574803

1228198,5,B00000IQBP,"You just have to face it, if you haven't seen any of the Muppet movies, you're missing some of the best movies ever made! The second of six Muppet movies (so far!), ""The Great Muppet Caper"" will have you and your family laughing!
The story begins with 'look-alike twins', Kermit the frog and Fozzie the bear, as reporters. Both of them are fired along with their fellow photographer, Gonzo the 'whatever', for passing up the story of the lifetime, the theft of the fashion queen Lady Holiday's (""the Avenger's"" Diana Rigg) jewels. The three friends are determined to get their jobs back and the only way they can think of to do that is to interview the Lady Holiday and to catch the thieves 'red-handed' (""What color are their hands now? Well.. watch the move."") So off they go to London. There they mistake Miss Piggy as Lady Holiday but they find out the truth. When they discover that Lady Holiday's brother, Nicky (Charles Grodin), and her three models Marla (Erica Creer), Carla (Kate Howard), and Darla (Della Finch) who were the thieves and are planning to steal the baseball diamond, it's up to Muppets and Co. to stop them. But can they do it with... toilet paper?
So much fun! Great family entertainment, you cannot miss it! And keep you eyes open for the superb cameos of great actors John Cleese, Robert Morley, Peter Ustinov, Jack Warden, Peter Falk, and even Oscar the Grouch! The humor is also very witty and it'll keep you laughing the whole and entire time! The music is very fun and catchy too, from ""Happiness Hotel"" and ""Night Life"".
If you liked this movie, watch the rest of the Muppet movies to. 1) ""The Muppet Movie"", the very first Muppet movie in which the Muppets go to Hollywood. 2) ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" do just what the title suggests. The Muppets take Manhattan! 3) ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is I think one of the best adaption of Charles Dickens's book. 4) ""The Muppets Treasure Island"" is not as dark as the movie, it's just the opposite! Fun, bright, hilarious, and terrific! 5) ""The Muppets from Space"" finally explains what Gonzo is. He's an alien from outer space! Will he be able to be united with his family?

1228199,5,B00000IQBP,"The second big-screen outing for Jim Henson's Muppets is nearly as good as the first. Kermit and Fozzie are investigative reporters with Gonzo as their photographer. To save their job's they need to find out who stole Lady Holiday's diamond necklace. Cue unforgettable musical numbers, cleverly choreographed dance routines and more Muppet laughs than you can shake a baseball diamond at.
The DVD release of The Great Muppet Caper was a little disappointing. The other two Muppet movies included more extra features, eg. Jim Henson interview or Camera Test, but this release only includes a handful of Muppetisms. Second long comical clips featuring Kermit and the gang. It would have been nice to see the original production featurette for this movie or even some original trailers from The Great Muppet Caper or The Muppet Movie.
Even though the special features are a little light we are still presented with the wide-screen version of an excellent Muppet movie with cameos galore and plenty of that Muppet magic. The musical score is also amazing. Provided by Joe Raposo, the man behind other Muppet music such as Bein' Green and the theme from Sesame street, it is as charming and friendly as the Muppets themselves. The sound is also included here in a 'Newly Created Dolby Digital' version so you get the full cinema surround sound right in your own living room!
