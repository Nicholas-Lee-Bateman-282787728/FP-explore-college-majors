5912201,5,B00EHJC9AE,"I am a big fan of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm and enjoyed it very much.  Nothing Earth-shattering, but if you like Curb, you will like this.  Almost like a Curb movie.  I never will look at silverware at a table in a restaurant the same.",1384819200,,243,4.239130434782608
5912202,4,B00EHJC9AE,"Good, but not perfect. You will like Clear History, if you like Larry David.  Personally, he slays me. In this flick, the main character has screwed himself by opting out of a company that makes butt-ugly cars, called the Howard. He looses potential gazillions, and starts over with a new haircut, in Martha's Vineyard no less. Things go downhill from there. Larry David is perfect as a guy who can piss off anyone, and does so at will. All of the supporting cast is (are) fun to watch, too.  Maybe not Shakespeare, but well worth a watch.",1384128000,4,539,4.546391752577319
5912203,5,B00EHJC9AE,"What could be wrong with a movie by LD that has the best cast, setting, plot, humor, and LD's philosophy. You don't even have to know what the movie is about - if Larry David is involved, you'll love it. Liev Schreiber (who I don't think was able to be listed in the cast because of Showtime's Ray Donovan) is hilarious - I love the way he always seems to sneak up on LD. I've seen the movie several times because each time I pick  up on something else. The comraderie between Michael Keaton & Bill Hader is amazingly funny. And the biggest boon is Kate Hudson, who is normally not such a wonderful actor. She nails her part in this one. Please LD, come out with another movie asap.",1383436800,2,682,4.246153846153846
5912204,5,B00EHJC9AE,"""You can't name a car Howard!"" Nathan (David) is an ad executive who is the best at what he does. After getting into a fight over what to name a new model of car with his boss Will (Hamm) he quits. When the car hits big and makes everyone involved with it very very rich Nathan moves and changes his name. Ten years later, he is content and happy with his new life in Martha's Vinyard. When Will moves to the Vinyard Nathan begins to think of ways to get him to leave. His best idea is to blow up his house. First and foremost this movie is hilarious. But like I have said before I have a specific style of humor that I love. The humor in this one is very Seinfeld like, which makes sense since 4 of the 4 writers wrote for Seinfeld. There are long tirades and running jokes about which car should back up on a one lane road, the placement of electrical outlets and the band Chicago. I laughed a lot throughout. Overall, if you like Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm you will love this movie. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.",1378598400,15,1033,4.144278606965174
5912205,5,B00EHJC9AE,"I absolutely loved this movie! Every time I see it is like my first time, it is truly another work of genius. Larry David absolutely does a wonderful job with this movie!!",1378339200,3,171,4.375
5912206,4,B00EHJC9AE,"Note:  This is a review based on a high definition viewing from HBO.  There might be spoilers.

Nathan Flomm (Larry David) is a long haired and bearded marketing executive who works for Will Haney (John Hamm) the owner/inventor of a new electric car.  Nathan was an early investor and owns 10% of the stock.  When Will decides to name the car the ""Howard,"" Nathan rebels.  Will offers to buy back Nathan's 10%.  The Howard becomes a huge success, although this car is so ugly it makes the Pontiac Aztec look like a Ferrari.

Nathan, unemployed and unhireable becomes the laughing stock of the country because his hasty decision cost him an estimated 1 billion dollars.  He moves across county to Martha's Vineyard near Boston and becomes a clean shaven, bald companion to an elderly spinster.  David brings his character from his TV show, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" with him to the role.  Now known locally as Rolly, he shoots out constant zingers at his friends and others in the small community.  The band ""Chicago"" is a key plot element and provide much of the film's soundtrack.  The much visited joke has to do with whether or not Larry's former girlfriend Wendy (Amy Ryan) had performed fellatio on various members of the band when they appeared there 20 years earlier.

When Rolly's former business enemy, Will moves to the neighborhood with his hot wife, Rhonda (Kate Hudson), he's worried that he will be recognized.  His salvation comes when he learns the townsfolk are up in arms over Will's building of a huge mansion which doesn't fit the look of the quaint town.  Perhaps the best character in the film is Joe Stumpo (hilarious Michael Keaton), a usually drunk local who is constantly making noise about the big house being built.  Together with Rolly's best friend, Frank (Danny McBride) and Joe's sidekick Rags (Bill Hader), they conspire to blow up the unfinished house while everyone is attending the ""Chicago"" concert.

Unbeknownst to Rolly, Will has been searching for Nathan to offer a gesture of conciliation.  In one of the funniest bits, Rolly has been hitting on Rhonda based on her wiping off a smudge of mustard off his face and the fact that she asks him to check her teeth for debris.  ""Enthusiasm"" regular J. B. Smoove is along for the ride as counter to David's constant criticism.  Eva Mendes goes from a fat gal Rolly ignored to a skinny girl with sex appeal and back to chubby.  For those needing a fix of Larry David and his character on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" this movie should satisfy.  For others Larry David may be an acquired taste.",1377129600,10,2568,4.747178329571106
5912207,4,B00EHJC9AE,"As a huge Larry David fan, I was looking forward to this movie with great anticipation. It didn't disappoint. It's like an extended version of Curb with a great cast. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.",1376697600,12,212,4.605263157894737
5912208,5,B00EHJC9AE,"Great entertainment. I enjoyed this movie. Sometimes people tend to overanalyze. I did skim through some of the reviews... I disagree with those who say this movie is a supposed dragged along tv show episode. I didn't feel that way at all while I was watching. Larry seems to play his usual character, and we also see another familiar face. Funny, relatable, and overall, worth a watch!",1514764800,,386,4.776119402985074

5912211,5,B00EHJC9AE,Michael Keaton deserved an academy award for best supporting role.,1508889600,,66,5.7
5912212,3,B00EHJC9AE,"It was ok.  Someone else pointed out that what works fine in 20 or 30 minutes, the ""Curb"" format, doesn't translate all that well to a full-length movie.  Kind of surprising that such talented writers didn't realize this, or maybe they did and just didn't care?  Cha-ching and all that.

I was also disappointed by the Jon Hamm part.  I think he is fabulous, at least his character in ""Mad Men"" was. His role here was just blah.  I'm always a bit surprised when a talented actor takes a rather dull role, but again I guess the cash register rings regardless.

And yes, that bit about ""blowing Chicago"" was a really low-class touch.",1508803200,,631,4.530973451327434

5912245,2,B00EHJC9AE,"This is Larry David up his own behind with his satisfaction playing himself, this time even controlling the location of The Larry David Show.

I had to turn it off at the point when the past sexual history of Larry David's former girlfriend becomes an issue for Larry. The issue for me is the utter male fantasy indulgence to think that a woman like Amy Ryan would be in a romantic relationship with Larry David, looking like Larry David, as old as Larry David, as judgmental and cantankerous as Larry David, for 3 years.

He should be amazed that a woman like her would consider him for a few minutes, not picking a fight with her after they've broken up and she's endured him for 3 years.

Hollywood needs to end this nonsense. I'm sick of the male fantasy relationship theme. Give Amy Ryan and everyone else the kinds of romantic partners they would have if they were just ordinary people going through life.

It's veering close to mental sexual abuse at this point. Your romantic prospects shouldn't take a hit because you're a film playing a waitress instead of an actual waitress.",1478995200,,1086,4.61139896373057

But the story line was more than just a little far-fetched and, as usual with Larry, the moral of the story was if he'd just not been so self-centered, he'd have been a lot better off.  The movie was a good time-killer but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a friend unless he or she was a die-hard Larry David fan.",1469923200,,402,4.276315789473684

8605273,3,B00EHJC9AE,"Overall, a good movie with good casting and comedic talent. Ten to twenty years ago I would have enjoyed it more but the ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb your enthusiasm"" type observations and ""you ever notice how..."" comedy doesn't carry the same weight it once did. I did enjoy the movie's improv style and Larry's one of the few that can lead an entire movie in this method . Great casting and backup as well. Always good to see Larry but once again, some of the comedy seems stale and you might become impatient with watching the same inane observations and arguments you have seen on dozens of Curb episodes and over 100 Seinfeld episodes.",1522540800,,632,4.601769911504425
