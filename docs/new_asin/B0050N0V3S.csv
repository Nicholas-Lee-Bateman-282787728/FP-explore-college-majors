4516046,5,B0050N0V3S,"Let me preface this review with a little history. I am an 80's girl and grew up doing Jane Fonda and Kathy Smith videos. Over the years I have done lots of different videos: step aerobics, billy blanks (Tae-bo still has a special place in my heart for getting me back into shape after baby #3), kettlebell, jari love (still love her videos), and many others over the years. I love to cycle/spin and do elliptical for cardo, but love my dvds. I'm 40 and some of the videos are starting to be  too much for me and make me too sore for days afterwards. I decided to try these videos because there was such positive feedback. I have never left feedback before, but I love these dvds so much I felt I needed to. This video is awesome! The workouts are effective and Im not too sore to function the next day. They get the job done! I have more ab definition than I have ever had with all the workout dvd's I have used in the past. I have realized its not about ""bulking up"", its about being lean and toned and sculpted. Try them!!",1315094400,74,1024,4.197969543147208
4516047,2,B0050N0V3S,"Sorry, but I thought this dvd was boring.  I didn't like the couple, Elizabeth seemed like she was hunched over for some parts of it, lots of repetitious moves, the workouts all blended together and for me it was one long snoozefest.  Also weird to me was the bouncing in one part, sorry I forgot what section.  I just didn't like their form.  They're a really mellow couple (maybe a little too mellow for me), and the ab part seemed good, but that's about it.  Wish I could have written a better review.",1314835200,4,504,4.376344086021505
4516048,5,B0050N0V3S,"This is the newest DVD of the Core Fusion series. When Core Fusion Cardio came out about a year ago I was one of the first ones to try it at the studio and I loved it! So when I saw they were coming out with a DVD I was ecstatic. Since all New Yorker's were stuck inside this weekend due to Hurricane Irene, I decided to give this DVD a try this morning and let me tell you I was sweating up a storm inside my own apartment!

Workout DVDs are not my strong suit, it is hard to get myself motivated when there is no one else there pushing me. But once the DVD started I was hooked. It was like I was taking a class at the studio. Some DVDs are very different from the classes that you would take at a studio but this one was just like being in class, I felt like Fred was in my apartment giving me a private session. The DVD is broken up into 6 sections about 10 minutes each. If you don't have a lot of time you can do one or two sections, or if you want a great workout do the entire DVD which is about 60 minutes.  The 6 sections are:

Energy Moves -  (10:10) Wake up your muscles and get your body warmed up, this was great because I was feeling pretty lazy when the DVD first started but after I got through this I was ready for more
Cardio Flow - (10:53) Sections 2-4 were my favorite, they are all done with light weights or you don't have  to use weights if you want to modify it. The sections are what they call a cardio flow, each move flows into the next. Each section is different which keeps you engaged the entire time. I tend to get bored with DVDs that make you do the same circuit multiple times but this DVD does not make you do that, you are constantly changing up the toning and cardio moves which is great for your body. The one thing that remains constant in these 3 sections are the mountain climbers. By the end of the 3 sections you will work your way up to 64 mountain climbers! Which sounds like a lot but they do it in a way where it flies by!
Power Flow - (10:36)
Power Sweat - (11:22)
Cardio Curl -  (10:41) Cardio Abs, wow this was hard! It was such a great workout for your core, you are constantly engaging it and you can really feel it changing your core, do this for a couple of weeks and you will have extremely strong abs!
Stretch - (9:23) Having a section dedicated to stretching was great because it makes you take the time to stretch your body after a hard workout

If you have never taken a Core Fusion class, I highly recommend this DVD. It is the perfect blend between cardio and toning. It will keep you engaged the entire hour and you will get an amazing full body workout. This DVD will be in my weekly workouts.",1314489600,48,2657,4.0399239543726235
4516049,5,B0050N0V3S,"Mountain Climbers.....There are a lot of them.  They are very effective for working your core (and your shoulders while you stay in the pose), and also provide a nice cardio blast - but not something everyone enjoys.  I personally love them and really liked this workout!  I wasn't really watching the modifier during the workout but it appears she stays in downward dog and does some knee bends.

There are (6) segments of about 10 minutes each including the stretch section. While yoga poses are used throughout the DVD, I never really felt like I was doing yoga.  You do need light hand weights - I used 2 lbs. The first four segments build on each other, the first segment starting slowly.  Here is a breakout of the DVD:

ENERGY MOVES (10:10) - all done standing except for planks and downward dog
o Shoulder rolls, standing twists, side stretches
o Second position squats, initially sweeping arms overhead, moving to some slow punches, and then twisting to warm up the spine
o Wide leg standing forward bend
o Pyramid pose variations
o Squat variations
o Standing quad stretch moving to Natarajasana
o Standing side bend
o High plank with slow alternating knee tucks
o Downward Dog
o Standing Side Bend
o Repeat plank with slow alternating knee tucks and downward dog

CARDIO FLOW (10:53) - need light hand weights
o Standing side stretches to high plank, to Mountain Climbers to Downward Dog - repeat cycle three times w/16 Mountain Climbers in first two cycles, 24 in the third
o High plank to side plank, back to center with pushup, side plank on alternate side (repeat twice)
o Downward dog
o Repeat standing side stretch to mountain climbers (24)
o Downward Dog variations (tuck knee, extend back)
o Repeat standing stretch to mountain climbers (32)
o Downward Dog
About 5 minutes into this segment:
o Lunge/Crescent Pose with side bend using weights
o Warrior 1 and Warrior 2, bending and straightening the bent leg, and using weights for upper body and waist work
If I counted correctly, there were 112 Mountain Climbers throughout this flow.

POWER FLOW (10:36)
Light weights are used during this entire routine except during the Mountain Climbers and Downward Dog
o Standing side stretch to Mountain Climbers (32) to Downward Dog
o Standing knee lifts and then stepping back to high lunge
o Slow punches with weights
o Standing side stretch to Mountain Climbers (40) to Downward Dog
o Stationary lunges moving to Warrior 3 using weights for triceps
o Standing side stretch  to Mountain Climbers (40) to Downward Dog
o Standing back leg raise moving to Warrior 3 pulsing the raised leg
o Standing side stretch to Mountain Climbers (48) to Downward Dog
They have you add twists when doing the Mountain Climbers in this flow.  Again, if I counted correctly there were 160 Mountain Climbers.  I think some may find the Warrior 3 based work rather challenging for balance.

POWER SWEAT (11:22)
I was sweating before I started this flow!  Light hand weights are used again throughout the standing portion of this segment.
o First 5 minutes alternates between second position plies alternating with standing knee lifts stepping back to high lunge
o Standing side stretch to Mountain Climbers (56) to Downward Dog
o ""Speed Skate"" squat variations holding weights behind you. Includes lateral and diagonal back leg raises.
o Standing side stretch to Mountain Climbers (64) to Downward Dog
o High plank
o Sphinx to  Child's Pose
I did drop the hand weights during the very last portion of the squats as I was feeling them in the lower back.

CARDIO CURL (10:41)
Traditional Core Fusion style c-curve ab work, adding in leg variations, but felt like a fresh routine.  Seemed like one of their tougher ab workouts, or perhaps I was just tired from the Cardio work!

BONUS STRETCH (9:23)
o Bridge moving into optional Wheel Pose.  Liz lifts one leg at a time while in Wheel.
o Several supine hip stretches - figure 4, ""butterfly"" (like a supine Gomukhasana), twist
o Sitting cross leg - side and shoulder stretches
o Seated twist (Ardha Matsyendrasana)
o Seated straight-leg forward bend
o Seated wide leg forward bend
o Thigh/hip stretch
o Downward dog
I liked this segment, although I paused the DVD and held some of the stretches longer than they did.

FINAL COMMENTS:
I really did like this DVD.  It got my heart going as promised, and I felt like I got a really good workout.  I didn't feel it in my glutes as much as some of their barre DVDs, but an excellent upper body, core and lower body workout.  Some portions may be challenging for a beginner although I did not watch the modifier that much during the workout.",1307750400,140,4625,4.7754077791718945

4516071,4,B0050N0V3S,"Be aware this is a yoga workout that doesn't use some cardio. By car do I use that word loosely because it is simply a fast moving slow. I do love how this takes a different spin on yoga incorporating strength and faster move similar to what you may have seen with free videos on YouTube. This is a great one to use I suggest you never do this warm up however its way too long and it looks like its shot in the 1980s and it's terrible. The rest of it is great. Note to advanced exercisers, this would be for your rest day a workout that stretches and strengthens but isn't going to push you. For beginners, this will be a nice way to build some strength so you can do some higher impact exercises later down the road.",1438214400,,717,4.092198581560283
4516072,5,B0050N0V3S,I've done a little of this.  But it is an advanced version of energy flow.  With weights.  It will work you.,1438214400,,108,4.0476190476190474
4516073,5,B0050N0V3S,Most cardio DVD's  or workouts start to attack right away and you get tired easily. But this DVD starts slowly and prepares you for the upcoming intense moves. It builds up your energy. So your work out intensity increases during workout but since they planned very carefully you feel more energetic at each passing minute and you have more energy to do tougher exercises later ..Great job whoever designed this. I feel so sweaty and energetic after done it.,1436572800,,458,4.7974683544303796

4516076,2,B0050N0V3S,"I am disappointed in this DVD. While some of the moves are somewhat challenging from a core strength/stability standpoint, I found it not intense on cardio at all. Or on anything else. I was looking for a DVD to do on my 'lighter' workout days to mix with my intense all-out bootcamp HIIT or strength training days so I thought this workout could fit the bill. I'd characterize this DVD as a fusion of power yoga and pilates-based moves with some twists but with very little cardio. I like power yoga, pilates, and barre, so I had high hopes, but found this DVD just too boring. The cardio is mainly in the form of mountain climbers, but the intervals are so short that it hardly gets your heart rate up. I think the longest interval was 56 mountain climbers, so given that one normally does 140 of those in a minute, you can tell how short of a burst that is. In the abs segment the cardio is in the form of bicycle crunches and you basically spend the entire 10 minutes in c-curve based moves (pilates), so all crumpled up, terrible for your posture, and abs only, no back excersises within this segment (which is part of your core after all) to balance things out. The best workout is the workout you'll actually want to do, and for me this definitely isn't it.",1430784000,,1264,4.405982905982906

This is not a magic workout video, if you want to have a six pack or toned core it takes diet, cardio, and strength exercises.  Diet is the probably 90% of the key to having that toned ab look.

4516103,1,B0050N0V3S,"This was a tough review to write.  The words seem to just flow when I love a workout.  When I don't care for a workout, I struggle with explaining why.  This is one of those workouts that I just didn't like.  And I am a person who loves all kinds of exercise.  This workout is described as strength training and flexibility one combined with high intensity cardio.

First, here are the positive things about this workout.

* Core Fusion co-creators, Fred DeVito and Elisabeth Halfpapp, know their stuff and provide good form pointers throughout the workout.

* A modifier is doing easier versions of all the exercises.

* The chaptering of the DVD allows you to pick and choose which sections to do.  You can do them all for a 60 minute workout, or just a do a few of the 5 sections.

Now, on to why I didn't like this workout.  In a word, it was boring.  Why I felt this way:

* Fred and Elisabeth, while they know their stuff, seem to have no personality.  I much prefer more dynamic personalities like Tony Horton, of P90X fame, or Tanya Becker, of Physique 57.

* The music is so bland as to be annoying.  I would have preferred no music.

* The set reminded me of sets from DVDs produced in the 80s.  It was bland.

** And the biggest reason I didn't care for this DVD was that it was not at all intense.  I am an advanced exerciser, but not so much with the barre/fusion type of workouts.  Even with the endless mountain climbers, my heart rate didn't even come close to my aerobic zone.

So, I would say if you are a beginner or low intermediate, you may find the intensity of this workout just right for you.  I would also strongly suggest that you watch clips to see if it is something you might like.  I personally love the Physique 57 workouts for intense barre and Suzanne Bowen workouts for intermediate barre.

I should also mention that this is the first Core Fusion workout that I have done, so I cant compare it to the other workouts in the series.",1392854400,3,1965,4.315068493150685

4516155,4,B0050N0V3S,"I generally enjoy the ""Exhale:"" series and bought this one for a cardio workout.  For background info, I work out 6 days a week, teaching sculpt/step classes 3 of those days.  When I workout at home, I use a chest strap heartrate monitor to make sure I'm working out in my ""aerobic"" zone.

This DVD comes with a menu that allows the viewer to pick a segment or do any or all of the five, 10 minute segments.  I chose the option to complete all five, a 50 minute workout.  My heartrate did not get above 110 until the 3rd segment.  I usually get to 140 in the first 10 minutes of the ""Tonique"" or one of the ""Firm"" cardio workouts  When I did get above 110, the highest my heartrate raised to was 130.

I to give this DVD 4 stars, because if you use a heavier weight and add squatting or propulsion moves in between the rests, you can get a moderate cardio workout and as is, I think it's a nice sculpting workout (adding weight.  I also like the ""mountain climbers"" (pistoning the legs while in plank) and the plie's with weights.  I will do this workout again on a light day or on a sculpting day.",1316822400,7,1098,4.185714285714286
4516156,2,B0050N0V3S,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I have enjoyed the other Core Fusion DVDs; while they are not as intense as my other workouts, I could find a place for them in my routine to strengthen and tone, and provide an alternative to some of my heavier workouts. The workouts on this DVD did not hit the right mix of cardio or toning that I expected. The only workout that I will do again on this DVD is the 'Power Sweat' segment. The other workouts don't raise the heart rate, and don't contain a good mix of toning moves. Maybe the diehard Core Fusion fans will enjoy it - but for newcomers, try one of their other excellent DVDs.",1316822400,13,625,4.260504201680672
4516157,5,B0050N0V3S,"Depending on who you compare me with, I am in relatively good shape. However, this was a challenge I had to work up to completing.
I had worked with another core exhale DVD that dealt with shaping and sculpting. As I enjoyed both the teaching method and the workout, I figured I would try this DVD. It is exactly what it says--pure intensity but worth all the hard work. I am, after a short time, seeing definite results I did not see with my other workouts. I highly recommend this workout if you're up for a challenge.",1316044800,10,520,4.371134020618556
4516158,5,B0050N0V3S,"I have been using the Cardio Intense DVD for about 2 weeks and I love it!! I really like the change up from
cardio to weights also, I feel like I get the best burn on my muscles and toning in my abs and thighs than any other fitness routine or DVD I have ever used. I love all the Exhale Core Fusion DVD's,the only exception would be the Energy Flow yoga, some of the moves are uncomfortable for me, other than that they are amazing,for anyone who is just beginning to use these, work on holding the form and movements,you will be so happy when you put on your shorts this summer!! I hope they continue to release new DVD's!",1315872000,5,624,4.1652892561983474
4516159,2,B0050N0V3S,I thought this workout video was too easy and not challenging for my fitness level. I hardly broke a sweat and did not feel breathless so to speak. I think it would be great for someone just starting out though. It just did not do it for me. I need higher intensity.,1315094400,5,266,4.134615384615385

A wonderful well rounded, yoga based workout.  Intense, yet at the same time you don't feel like your going to keel over.  I had time for 4 segments today and I felt great when I was finished.  Wish I could have had time to complete the last segment.",1452470400,,395,4.077922077922078
