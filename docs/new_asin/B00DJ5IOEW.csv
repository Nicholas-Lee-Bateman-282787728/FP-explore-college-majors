5819357,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Like I said in my review of part 1, you'll want to watch all 4 discs. The story is too compelling to quit half-way.
This story I'll be watching over and over, and not because Michiko is so smokin' hot! By the way, if you're looking for hentai in this series, forget it. The producers opted for exceptional sexiness, without ANY overt nudity. They strictly ""sold the sizzle and kept the steak"". And, honestly, it made the show that much more fun to watch.",1379894400,17,454,4.416666666666667
5819358,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"one of my absolute favorites! its awesome and has great characters, and its great to see some people of color in anime that aren't terrible stereotypes. if you like strong woman leads, this is for you!",1400544000,,201,4.611111111111111
5819359,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"First off I want to say that I almost exclusively watch action anime. This isn't an action series, but is now one of my all time favorites. The art and animation is amazing, but where the series really shines is its story and characters. I don't remember the last time I watched a series where you could feel for the characters. All in all these series is really moving and I would recommend it to anyone.

Only negatives have to do with the price not the series. The series should have been released as one collection not 2 rather expensive parts. (This is Funimation's fault) Although the price for the whole series is a little steep I still think its worth the money and would recommend buying it",1396396800,,699,4.4609375
5819360,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Tired of the teenage angst?  Weary of the apocalyptic doom?  Yearn for the good old days
of jamming with Edward and rockin' with Revy?  Think Cowboy Bebop or Black Lagoon set
in Brazil.  Think sexy, violent, and the realistic raw edge of crazy insane unrequited love.
Wildly entertaining with upbeat latin / hip hop influenced music.  This series is such a breath
of fresh air in the inbred world of Japanese anime, where knock offs and copycats abound.
In my humble opinion, the ending is realistic and absolutely rings true, at least from the
viewpoint of an adult.  Don't miss out on this series, too much time in between classics like this.",1392076800,2,644,4.705357142857143
5819361,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Great music, stunning visuals and a bevy of strong female leads help make this show a must own. More things like this need to be made.",1391385600,,134,4.1923076923076925
5819362,3,B00DJ5IOEW,"I think this series was imaginative and had a strong beginning... I feel the quality of the animation is phenomenal. However, I just felt like the ending was forced, ended too soon and kind of on a strange note... I left this anima wishing there were more to the story.",1389744000,3,269,4.4
5819363,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"This is an excellent anime series. If you are a Cowboy Bebop fan, this is a must get.

First the item review: The case is well done and the Blu-ray quality is superb. The actual video is 1080p native with good color and contrast. The dub in English is really amazing, you can feel the emotions from the dialogs (it is not a plane dub without emotion just reading text).

Second the anime: The story is around Michiko, an inmate in a prison in Rio (well that's what I think, I don't really remember) who took part on gang wars searching for Hatching, the daughter of boyfriend she had. Once the search of Hatching is over, they embark in a quest for searching Hatchins father. My description may sound pretty lame but do not be fooled, this series touches mature content, gun fight and social problematic that makes you to not leave your tv seat. The soundtrack is impressive and it immerses you in the favelas.

 As a fan of this series, my advice is: If you do not have it, what are you waiting for, do it. It is worth the money.",1388620800,,1030,4.321243523316062
5819364,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Michiko & Hatching is a very fun and adventurous anime and I will let the show do the talking for itself. It is simply amazing. If you love adventures, fun, humor, great story line and a little action from here to there. You will love this anime. Highly recommended. Definitely worth a watch and a buy.",1387584000,,302,4.410714285714286

5819366,5,B00DJ5IOEW,If you are a fan of cowboy bebop you will fall in love with this. The second series was even better than the first. Edgy and emotionally complicated with great musical accompaniment ! This anime geek approves,1383177600,5,208,4.648648648648648
5819367,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Great series, great story, great characters, great acting, great everything. I cannot recommend highly enough. The blu ray quality is fantastic by the way, definitely worth a buy.",1380499200,7,179,5.428571428571429

8593710,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Michiko and Hatchin is a series that drew my attention due to it's origin, and that origin is filmmaker Shinichir Watanabe. He also directed Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Space Dandy, and in my opinion, those are some of the best! You won't be disappointed in this series if you are a fan of his previous work. This series follows an escaped convict and an abused girl, and their path towards a common shared person. More of a slice of life type of genre. The art and animation is second to none, so detailed and believable, and so fluid in it's movement. If you liked Cowboy Bebop or any of the aforementioned, you will love this! (although not as action packed as the others)",1441065600,,683,4.516129032258065

8593715,5,B00DJ5IOEW,"Don't miss this. As with Attack on Titan, Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop, Eden of the East,..... what you get is an amazingly stylish, coherent, one of a kind show that's uplifting and a whole lot of fun. It looks darn good in high definition too.",1410566400,,247,4.511111111111111
