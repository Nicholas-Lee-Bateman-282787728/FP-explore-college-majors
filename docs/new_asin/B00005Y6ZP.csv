I have the ANTELOPES&GAZELLES and PREDATORS, and I want to buy something in the same series - from the same narrator, producer, team etc. There is something about this recipe that is pure magic to my young son.

Horrible to admit, but I don't know why he likes it so much.  He is a normal kid who usually would rather play WII, DS, PLAY STATION, Legos, etc., but these videos awaken something in him.  And  honestly I find them a bit slow...I mean the filming is elegant, the music verges on classical, the narration is technical with a formal British accent and complicated words (""orifice"", for example).

This is not your typical techno-boom-blast children's video; it reminds me of WILD KINGDOM and the shows that I grew up on.  It isn't like the dizzying cartoons and other shows on TV these days.

I credit these films with giving my son a love of science and geography.  We use them on road trips (15+ hours in a car, typically), and he wants to watch them again and again - never complaining about the time in the car - while analyzing the landscape through his car window, trying to give commentary like the narrator.

I usually don't write anything here, but it is absolutely impossible to do a search on Amazon and figure out which film to purchase for your child.  When I read the other comments about the music, the quality of the editing etc. I could see what the person was referring to -- now that even news has gone all glitz and back beat --

but whatever the reason, this beautiful, slow, scientific commentary has captivated the imagination of my young son for more than 3 years, and I wanted to let other parents know.  For those people looking for something reminiscent of BBC or PBS, with information and learning as its foundation, don't be afraid to get this.",1352419200,,1890,4.459302325581396

2.-Contrast is very poor. I do not know what did they do in postproducttion but it needs a total adjustment on chroma, video, pedestal and so on..

3.-The music hits the target sometimes, but most of the time does not match the situation.

4.-The narrator is not the best in the bussiness.

5.-Birds are mostly shot in Afrika, but in south america there are 40% of the species and overall more than 50% in all the americas.

I hope the other two episodes are better (not expecting so much)",1117152000,,565,4.61
