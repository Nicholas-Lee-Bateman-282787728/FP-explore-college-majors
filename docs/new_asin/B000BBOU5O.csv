2411663,5,B000BBOU5O,"I have waited so long for this to come out on DVD. Raise the Red Lantern is a movie about the 4th wife of a rich lord. She moves into his palace and is given her own house within the walls like all the other wives. The red lantern is raised at the house where the lord chooses to stay for that night. The movie is about the competition between the wives to not only have the lantern raised at their own house, but to have it raised the most days in a row. There are dramatic twists to the movie that will not dissapoint. If you don't own this movie already, buy it!",1132790400,9,565,3.9649122807017543
2411674,5,B000BBOU5O,"My review will only be about the movie, not the dvd quality. Like all Gong Li movies this one leaves you with a disturbed feeling at the end. Gong Li is such a beautiful woman and when the wives and servants are at each other in this world where men rule it is hard to imagine such a place.  It is a very good movie and leaves you with a feeling similar to the end of Farwell my Concubine. I love all Gong Li movies but I can only watch most one time because of the way the movie makes you feel, sort of disturbed and bothered.",1260748800,,527,3.925233644859813
2411675,1,B000BBOU5O,"This review is for the 2006 DVD release of this film, not the 2007 release. Obviously, you'll want to get the 2007 release, not the 2006.

Unbelievably bad DVD rendition of this film. The first thing to greet you are the constant film damage blips and scratches which continue throughout the film. They couldn't find an undamaged celluloid original to copy to DVD? One of the most acclaimed Chinese films of its time and its presented this way? Shame! And then there's the translation. What a pathetic translation. It's all over the place with misspellings, typos, disjointed sentences, missing words, and ridiculous transliterations. You have to grapple with this translation to comprehend the meanings. They couldn't find an actual English speaker with a minimum sixth grade education to double-check the English? Beyond comprehension.

I give it one star to ward you off from this edition. The 2007 release must be the production this version should have been. It's truly beyond belief that they placed this version into production. Were they in a hurry? What a disgrace.

As to the drama itself? Wow, what a bummer. It definitely wasn't ""groovy."" Another Chinese woman caught in a claustrophobic cultural/social cage story. Never seen one of those before, have you? But Gong Li was gorgeous and talented as always, and it was all well acted and filmed and costumed. The story continued straight ahead to depressing, but if that's your thing, go for it. I would have given it four stars. It's a good film, all in all. Zhang Yimou is the ""in"" Chinese director these days, so you're not supposed to say bad things, so I won't say anymore.

But if you like this one, you must see ""Farewell, My Concubine"" if you haven't already. Different director (of different talents) but also starring (partly) Gong Li. Cultural traps again, but much more complex. For me, that one travels miles over this one, is a much richer experience, and won't leave you feeling at the bottom of the bottomless pit. Same historical period but it operates on so many more levels. That one is one of the greatest films of all time.",1226966400,3,2105,4.855153203342619

2411682,5,B000BBOU5O,"""Raise the Red Lantern"" is a ""Must See/Buy"". Gong Li is peerless. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is a gripping story of four wives and one powerful and wealthy husband. Each wife struggles, competes and schemes with and/or against the other three wives for the affections of the husband and status within the house. The wife ""in favour"" for the night gets red lanterns strung outdoors along the sidewalk leading to her appartments of the estate compound. With four wives and one husband, rule #1 is ""There are no rules."" Rule #2 is ""Last one standing wins: and maybe not"".

2411683,1,B000BBOU5O,"Watching the Razor release (which I bought to save a few dollars) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated. Let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times.

2411716,1,B000BBOU5O,"Let me be clear, this is a beautiful film. One of the best foreign films I have ever seen with gorgeous cinematography and an outstanding performance by Gong Li (She is an incredible actress). It earned outstanding reviews from critics which it rightfully deserved for its superb storytelling of passion, envy and well, gossip.

  With that being said avoid this DVD at all cost. I've seen countless foreign films from around the world and this is the worst DVD I have ever seen. The picture quality is terrible with constant errors and scratched images, but even worse is the subtitles which are absolutely horrendous. It's obvious NO ONE at this company cared to preview the DVD before putting it out on the shelves. The mistakes range from annoying like ""Savant"" instead of ""Servant"" to just laughable, ""Don't be so groovy"".

  There isn't a single reason to own this DVD. If want to see this film (and if you're a fan of foreign films I strongly urge you do), try to track down the VHS if possible on Ebay or wait for a better company to hopefully get its hands on it, either way don't waste your time with this embarrassment.",1167955200,21,1130,4.625
2411717,3,B000BBOU5O,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers.

I'm sort of glad I bought this film because the story (and Gong Li) was splendid.

The colors are dull and washed out and the English subtitles are poorly translated, ruining the stately mood of the movie.  This is not how a classic film should be watched! Hopefully a legitimate DVD company like Criterion will decide to release the movie with a properly done transfer.

2411720,5,B000BBOU5O,"Red Lantern is a carefully crafted story centered around a young woman named Songlian, played by the ever-brilliant Gong Li. Songlian's hopes and dreams of college and a better life are cruelly cut short by the sudden and unexpected death of her father. With no money for school and at the insistence of her mother, Songlian is forced to marry Chen, a wealthy landowner who already has three wives of his own. Each of the wives reside in separate wings of his centuries-old castle estate. The living quarters are extremely upscale and come complete with a personal servant and maid. But, like the storied bird in the gilded cage, their lives are sad, empty and lonely.

Although the wives command respect and obedience from the hired help, they are nothing more than chattel to the wealthy Chen. Each day, the wives, along with their respective servant, stand at the entrance of their quarters waiting to see at which door the ""red lantern"" will be placed. This is how Chen chooses his wife for the evening. The ""lucky"" chosen wife is treated to a ritual foot massage by one of the older woman servants and her apartment is filled with large glowing red lanterns which burn brightly through the night. There are so many lanterns set up both inside and out that it, at first appearances, seems romantic but quickly ends up underscoring the true nature of the rite. It's a custom that quickly becomes apparant to be nothing more than lewd, sadistic sexual subjugation. It's not romantic, it's not passionate ... it's just a cruel game for Chen's entertainment. As the story progresses, we see struggle in almost every scene. There are secret alliances between the wives, the servants and the elite that frequent the master's estate. There is continual animosity between the wives as they plot and scheme to stay viable and remain in the master's good favor. There is an oversupply of backstabbing, betrayal and class struggle to be found between all of the major players. We also see the formation and disintegration of relationships between the wives. And, although the master tries to present himself as a peacemaker, it is gradually realized that he is actually the instigator of most of the hostility. Having the wives scratch and claw (metaphorically, that is) for his attention only serves to satisfy his own massive ego. Cycles of abuse are perhaps no more apparant when we see the wives, who are clearly victims in their own right, begin to victimize each other in an attempt to elevate their standing within the social order of the castle. The film is rich with many moments that are both sad and poignant. For example, although Songlian did not originally welcome the ritualistic foot massage, she grew to like it and missed it tremendously on those nights when she was not selected to be the ""wife of the evening"". She, along with the other unchosen wives, had to endure the very loud rattling sound of the foot massage from across the courtyard. It only further reminded them that they were unwanted and that they were not special. Did she miss the actual foot massage or what the massage represented? It became nothing more than a cruel Pavlovian experiment on the part of Chen. Chen seems to enjoy manipulating the women. Alternating between reward and punishment, he carefully trains them as if they were pets. The castle is a cauldron of sorts and it's only a matter of time before everything bubbles over. Without giving too much away, I'll only say that the storyline moves along resulting in tragic consequences that could hardly be seen as being entirely unexpected.

The heart of this film is in its exploration of the indomitable female psyche. The film continually centers around very strong female characters struggling to survive under horrific conditions both psychologically and emotionally. The ability of the female psyche to maintain personal identity and spiritual freedom within the male-dominated Zeitgeist of feudal China is intrinsic to this story and although this sort of struggle is not really unique to Asian culture, it is handled in a very deliberate unapologetic fashion that makes this film not only special to watch but, necessary as well.

I've been working backwards through director, Yimou Zhang's body of work and, in the process I unwittingly saved the best for last. Just kidding ... well, maybe a little. Yimou Zhang is certainly a director who likes to experiment. It seems like he's not content to make the same film over and over no matter how good the recipe is. Each of his films has a unique and distinct quality. This film is lensed in a very traditional straightforward fashion with equal amounts of closeups and far shots. The storyline is engrossing and carried along in a rich narrative style. The dialogue, although integral to the story seems almost secondary to the unspoken communication in the form of facial expressions, body language and other physical interactions between the characters. The film had many long visual sequences which seemed to tell the story better than any carefully worded text ever could. In my opinion, this is Gong Li's finest performance to date and I highly recommend seeing this film.",1159401600,9,5178,4.9154285714285715
2411721,1,B000BBOU5O,"Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful movie with a great story.  When I had heard that this movie was going to be transfered to DVD format, I was thrilled. And then I bought the DVD, and to my dismay, within the first couple of minutes into the movie, there were white lines and distortion. Since I loved the movie so much, I thought I would make an exception for the first few minutes, but as the movie continued, so did the white lines.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  The DVD copy of this movie, reminded me of the old movies I use to see years ago, when there were only 7 channels on TV.

And not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound. It's very harsh and nasally.

2411741,4,B000BBOU5O,"Now that the polygamy issue seems to be in the forefront, this movie is worth a look.  Polygamy has come up as a defense for preventing gay marriage in the U.S.  Big Love attempts to show what life is like for a polygamist family.  Raise the REd Lantern is much more nuanced and rich.  The tragic effects of having one man with all the power and his wives competing for status and power may say more about society than just the institution of polygamy.  At any rate Wife No. 1 is a realist and has come to accept her place.  She doesn't try to undercut the other wives and in fact, is saddened by the continuation of the ruined lives of young women.  Wife No. 2 is the master manipulater while wife No. 3 has found another life and would rather be left alone.  Of course the conventions at that time prevent her version of happiness.  The main character, wife No. 4 starts as a naive young bride who gradually learns to play the game and vie for power.  However she can't turn her back on the grief and tragedy that ensues.  The acting is first rate and the sets, costumes, cinematography are beautiful.

I generally take them with a grain of salt since I don't buy but a fraction of DVD's for the movies I look up.  I'm mainly interested in the movie itself.  I couldn't help but notice the scathing reviews of the quality of this DVD.  Since I had already bought the DVD on its' reputation alone, I sat back to watch the movie for the first time.  I was not to be distracted by quality since I had no other version to compare it to.  I didn't mind the film quality of blurred color and perferated film.  I was prepared for the misspelled and, ocassionally, misleading English subtitles.  However, when the DVD froze as the film reached its' dramatic peak, I was angry.  It froze on that spot so bad that I was only able to see through it by segmenting ahead and rewinding.  I rewound it enough times to recognize where it was about to skip over (it was frozen forwards and backwards).  Only then could I watch the end.  For once, I have cause to rate the movie because of the quality of the DVD.  I shall seek a refund.

The movie?  It was a good movie.  I had just seen ""Letter to Three Wives"" and I was conscious of the similarity in that both movies have a main character who was ever-present except on film.  With appologies to the purists, I will make no more comparisons between those two movies.  This was a very good Bluebeard story set in China of 1920.  The excellent cultural aspects of the setting of this ""modern"" fairy tale are quite impressive.  The movie moves along well and there is an aura of mystery throughout the movie that controls our interest.  The acting is very good as well.  Why didn't I rate this with 5 stars?

To top things off, my wife and I who had been anticipating release of this incredible movie on DVD have viewed the many reviews describing the appallingly poor quality of this release and will most likely now have to wait many more years to elapse before we will see Raise the Red Lantern again.

I have the film on VHS and could have made a much better quality DVD myself. Given that one of the many qualities of the film is the cinematography, it is nothing short of a travesty that this DVD release makes the film look, colour aside, as if it was made at the dawn of the era of cinema.

When played on cable, this movie was subtitled beautifully. I have no idea why it was resubtitled for DVD release. The English is so poor that the film is almost unintelligable. The spelling, grammar, and syntax are hideous.

If they were going to make us wait so long for the DVD release of this film, why on earth didn't they use someone even remotely literate to do the translations?

The likelihood of this being re-released at any point is slim. Try to catch it on cable, if you can, because there's no way to get the full value of this remarkable and beautiful film the way they've released it in this format.

It does indeed look like a very bad job was done of ""taping"" this movie.  It looks like an old VHS tape you might have that was copied from a copy (that itself had been copied from another copy).  The translations are extremely poor (my initial thought was they had gotten a person whose primary language was Chinese, and that didn't speak English very weel to translate the movie).  Also, they only translate the audio...any characters written on the screen are not translated.

If you've seen the version of this movie on the premium cable channels, don't expect to see that same quality.  That is not the version you get on the DVD.

I love Yimou's fascinating use of aural and color symbolism in this gorgeous outcry against human suffering.

That being said, this DVD was an utter travesty!  If I hadn't bought this thing from Amazon, I would have sworn this thing was bootlegged.  It was in such bad shape.  The image was dirty and scratched, as though it had been taken from a very old print.  The colors were noticeably lackluster and washed-out.  The soundtrack was extremely muddy.  And don't even get me started on the subtitles.  It was a HORRIBLE translation!  They definitely detracted from the film.

I know for a fact that there are better prints out there.  When I first saw a version of this in film school, it was on laserdisc.  The laserdisc had beautiful visuals.  And having watched the VHS version a few times, I know that there are far better translations out there.

I can't tell you how embarrassed I was to show this DVD to my husband after having talked about how great this film.

And the sub-titles? Prease, do not odd started me get mister.

Previous reviewers are not exaggerating the awfulness of the DVD's English subtitles. The VHS sub is better by leaps and bounds: at least the English therein makes sense. My favorite thing about the DVD's English translation--and I use the word ""translation"" very loosely--is that the Chinese name ""Yan'er"" is butchered in the subtitles. (I don't even remember what her name is written as, except that it did at least begin with a Y.) And all I can say about the DVD's picture is that I've seen cheap bootlegs with better quality.

This was a beautifully filmed and very captivating movie that I have waited for for years with very high anticipation to come out on DVD. I was so very excited when I preordered it, but alas, the picture quality is terrible, and filled with flaws as is the translation. I don't even know where to begin on how bad the translation on the subtitles are, but some of it is absolutely nonsensical to say the least. First of all the movie is set in the early part of the twentieth century, and it actually uses the word ""groovy"", and in a way that would make no sense even if you were in the correct era. There are many flaws in the sub-titles that were not in the VHS movie, such as words left out that should be there in order to make sense in English, and they have substituted the word ""mister"" instead of the original ""master"", and ""savant"" instead of the original ""servant"", overall just a very poor English translation I am sorry to say. I don't understand why they didn't just copy the translation word for word from the VHS tape?

I don't wish to discourage anyone from watching this movie, because I feel it is a must see movie, and in my eyes, a must own movie, but I would discourage anyone from buying this rendition of it on DVD.

Normally I wouldn't bother to comment about subtitles in a foreign movie but for this classic I have to, especially after waiting so long for the dvd to come out.

""we are like cates and dogs""

""don't be so groovy"" (!)

""...I'll go get some liqeur for me...""

""she has just past away..""

""I don't understand what our live is all about...""

""..she has gone completely mad. Production credit."" (???)

Also the substitles were completely omitted during the change-of-season announcements, which are Chinese symbols. The original vhs copy had these, and decent subtitles.

They claim that they haven't gotten any other negative comments about the DVD (I doubt that) and I wrote them back and informed them about the 92 one-star reviews here on Amazon.com. Please write them and express your dissatisfaction with this DVD! Here is their response (sounds like making a lot of excuses to me):

This is Shelley Praamsma, our company, MagicPlay, has the privilege from Chinese filmmakers to re-release ""Raise Red Lantern"" on DVD again.

I am so sorry to hear that the video quality of ""Raise Red Lantern"" is somewhat a disappointment to you and perhaps to others who didn't share their comments with us. I would like to take this opportunity to express our apology as well as to explain and hopefully you will continue to love indi / foreign films and continue to support our efforts in bringing more foreign programs to you.

Yes, you are all very sharp recognized the video quality isn't good. It was a huge frustration for us to bring ""Raise Red Lantern"" onto DVD with an understanding that we may receive negative reviews toward this program, because the current licensor couldn't provide good quality of the master. However, we, ourselves, are the big fans for Gong Li, Zhang Yimou and have the privilege and the responsibility to make this program possible to consumers.

It is shame that there aren't ""Good Quality"" masters of ""Raise Red Lantern"" currently in the procession of Chinese licensors. It is no longer a problem of poor transfer, it simply a problem by worn master. We have gone through all the film prints and Beta kept in Chinese studio, they are all overplayed and have way too many more passes used on the film print than worth of keeping.

Even the VHS version released by Orion (MGM) and various DVD versions ever released in different labels, they all had poor video quality.

By this time when we re-issue ""Raise the Red Lantern"" again, the Beta master has already been worn. Chinese filmmakers wish to release ""Raise Red Lantern"" and make it available to consumers outside of Asia. We felt passionate to re-treat the film print and make it possible to consumers.

Sad to say that all the film have been prints kept in Chinese studio are also in poor conditions because of lacking temperature control and had way too may passes.  We did the best we could to have film transferred onto beta, then compressed onto DVD. Unfortunately, the video quality can't be improved much.

At this time, we are checking in other country such as Japan or Europe if we could locate another film print or Beta whose video quality is better than what Chinese studio could provide. So that we could transfer the video and re-create a new DVD master.

We will keep you posted with the searching progress and will send you a new DVD we could locate a better master in any possible way. I hope that you will share this with your friends who also like our Foreign Film catalogue and continue your supports to independent films. More importantly, we appreciate very much for your comments whether they are critiques or complements and hopefully your foreign film library will grow along with ours.

Thank you very much for your understanding and supports.

Kind Regards,

It's obviously mastered from a very used print. It looks quite similar to a print I saw at a Zhang Yimou retrospective at a film festival about 5 years ago, lustrous still, but covered in scratches. As for the color bleed, I think SOME of it is intentional. I know three-strip technicolor is sometimes shot without aid of a filter in order to get that glowy effect-- how much is hard to tell though, since this is obviously not even remotely the best source. The picture quality is not the only issue. The sound could use a little cleaning up as well, and the English subtitles were riddled with the kinds of mistakes common to cheap, bootlegged versions of Chinese cinema. One exmple was use of the word ""savant"" when ""servant"" was intended.

I am not the first (nor will I be the last) to express how awful the Razor DVD release of Raise the Red Lantern truly is.  And it's horrifying to think that this travesty might be someone's first introduction to such a beautiful film.

I have loved this film since I first saw it in 1992--my university made Raise the Red Lantern an annual part of its excellent foreign film lineup--and I can't remember how many times I saw it or how many friends I made see it.  (I do know that one year I trekked out to see it three times in less than a week because I was writing a paper on it.)  As beautiful as Yimou's other films are, this one is my favorite, with its deep psychological layers, beautiful cinematography, and haunting story.

Yet this release is riddled with problems.  Both the picture and the sound have a snap-crackle-pop quality -- in fact, the picture looks snowy in so many places that it's almost funny when you get to a scene where it really is snowing because it doesn't look real.  Yimou is such a master with color, blanketing entire shots with red, white, yellow, or blue, but that is ruined with the black and white scratches all over the picture.  Surely someone somewhere has a good copy of the film that could have been used in making this DVD.  It is especially awful in the darker nighttime shots, because the colors bleed, and there is none of the sharp focus that one expects in a digital format.

The subtitles are laughable.  At one point, one character tells another not to be so ""groovy"" - gloomy? - before she sneaks off to see her ""secrete"" lover.

This release is an insult to all involved.  Please find a VHS copy to watch--but don't ask for mine, becasue I'm certainly not giving it up.",1140912000,9,1790,4.401215805471125
2411816,1,B000BBOU5O,"I saw this film in Portland when it was new, in 1991.  It is a stunner.  I bought (and have) the VHS tape from Orion and later bought a bootleg Hong Kong dvd from Era.  This version from Razor is so awful, it is not be worth watching: the color is worse that Era and beyond that, the picture quality looks like someone dragged it around on the floor for a few years.  Buy a used version of one of the others.  It could not be worse!  [...]",1140825600,8,439,3.9318181818181817

You simply can not believe your eyes when the titles at the beginning of the film start to roll. Scratches all over the places, overblown colours, and it does not get better.

This is a really shoddy release, that nobody who loves this film should buy. Why was this released at all? This is no favour to the film and its creators. And surely it is no calling card for the company who released this mess.

So: BEWARE!",1140739200,10,531,4.237623762376238
2411818,1,B000BBOU5O,"This is one of my very favorite films and I have a VHS version about 12 years old. I placed the film on my DVD ""wish list"" with Amazon.com, was excited to hear from Amazon.com that the film was finally being released on DVD and immediately ordered it. My assumption was that the film would be digitally remastered and would be a DVD treasure.
My wife and I watched it last night. The movie began with black and white streaks and snow throughout the film. The translation contained multiple misspelled words and grammatical errors. The colors were horrible, with bleeding reds and out of focus blue scenes. It was as if someone had found an old VHS tape and decided to make a bootleg copy to DVD with their own amateurish translation. After the DVD movie was over, we even put the 12 year old VHS tape in to compare quality and the difference was like night and day.
[...] The transfer of this movie from VHS to DVD is a travesty.",1140652800,11,929,4.406976744186046

I can only reiterate what everyone else has said - the film quality is so bad and the translation is so ridiculous that about 15 minutes into it I just had to turn it off. I have never seen such a poor-quality DVD! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF THE DVD! It's a piece of junk and does no justice to the absolute beauty of the original movie.",1140652800,,482,4.366666666666666
2411820,2,B000BBOU5O,"I've been waiting for ""Raise the Red Lantern"" on DVD for quite awhile.  It is good to finally see it available. However, this transfer is very disappointing.  First of all, the print is not restored.  In fact it's not a new one!  This one's been shown many times in some cinema somewhere with scratches and all.  Also the ""Surround"" sounds more like mono to me.  And worse of all, in 2006, it's ""widescreen"" but not ""Anamorphic"" nor ""Enhanced"" for widesceen televisions.  I still have my Laser Disc of this fim which is ""Pan and Scan"", but at least it's a new print and in real ""Surround"" sound!  This is a stunning film visually and a wonderful story.  It's a shame someone didn't do it justice.  Keep an eye out for a new mastering one of these days.  Hey,  Criterion!  Are you listening?",1140566400,,790,4.47887323943662

The film as other has indicated, is scratchy. Looks like someone just took a bad print and just transfer it without any thought. I'll have to wait for a better copy. What a pity! Recently, I acquired a digitally remastered anamorphic version released by ERA entertainment (in Hong Kong); this version is superb and is for all zones - I also just threw away the Razor Digital version.",1140480000,9,566,4.504854368932039

I think I have watched it at least a dozen times.  I already own a VHS copy but liked the movie so much I wanted something that would last longer than a VHS tape.  After this long wait boy was I disappointed.  Not only is the picture poor, (lots of lines, distortions and poor color), but someone rewrote the translations.  Also, not only were words changed, there were a lot of spelling errors.  As for widescreen, it is the weirdest widescreen I have ever seen.  It is like someone put a rectangular box over the picture and one side of the box moves!

We recently went to Shen Yun, the dance company show, and the 6000 year old
dances and songs were in this movie! Typically strange, our director and his
favorite actress come together in this movie to leave lasting impressions.
They were recently banned from making movies in China, but I think the
punishment is over now.
Shen Yun, portrays Chinese arts of dance and song, has been all over the
world, showing the rich culture of ancient China; the only country they
haven't is in China where they are forbidden to go.
China is a place with such different cultures and arts, this movie
shows what life was like colliding modern and old customs. Hard

8084860,5,B000BBOU5O,"I rented this without being familiar at all with the title, or actors, or Director. I was glad I gambled on it.

What is beautiful, is the absolutely wonderful acting, the cinematography, the clothing, and the manner of decor.

What is disturbing, is the manner in which women were used, what they were subjected to, how the method of living pitted the women against one another, and how the new and intelligent 4th Mistress fell into the trap and game of it all.

What is ironic, is how certain methods of living were to bring about peace and tranquility, yet this method shows only turmoil, agitation, competition that becomes dangerous, and the resulting heart breaking insecurity and fear.

What is cruel, is the manner in which the women are left to fight for these 'bone tosses' of foot massages (that are still not even really a gift for them - yet a kind of method used to prepare the women for intercourse and to better serve the Master, as he himself stated), and for the shreds of attention from the Master. How incredibly demeaning to have to stand there each evening to see where the red lanterns will be hung that night. I was thoroughly disgusted.

Though they are all expected to support and exalt one another, did you notice what the 1st Mistress whispers after the very first meeting with the 4th Mistress? Ironic. If a rich man's way of life with having several wives and concubines is acceptable and even respectable and honorable, why then would it be considered sinful and wicked for the women who became the Mistresses to him???? The irony.

All this makes for one very powerful message that was sent out. No wonder it was banned in that country. No wonder it never made it to the theater screen over there.

This film is a powerful work of art. Do see it.",1309132800,3,1779,4.5754716981132075
8084861,2,B000BBOU5O,"The film is set in China in the 1920s during the Warlord Era (1916-1928) when the country was divided among military cliques. Nineteen year-old Songlian (Gong Li) resolves cynically to marry (or become the mistress of) a wealthy man to lift herself out of poverty. Her father has died and left the family penniless. She marries into the Chen family, becoming the fourth mistress (concubine) of the wealthy master. Like the three previous ""wives"" she is assigned her own lavish quarters where, on nights the master elects to sleep with her, red lanterns are hung out.

The four mistresses or ""sisters"" share meals (except for the one chosen as the master's sleeping partner for the night; she receives special treatment) and socialize. It is soon apparent that there is a web of jealousy, suspicion and intrigue that underlies their relationships, as they vie for the master's favor.

The first mistress has borne the master a son, who is now around Songlian's age. The third mistress is a former singer in the Chinese opera. She is unhappy with her status as mistress and later confides in Songlian that she is meeting clandestinely with Dr. Gao, the family's physician.

Songlian is assigned a servant girl, Yang, who regards her mistress with contempt and jealousy. When Songlian discovers that Yang has secretly raised red lanterns in her own servant quarters, she flies into a rage, smashes the lanterns and drags Yang out for punishment. Yang becomes ill from shock and later dies.

On her birthday Songlian gets drunk and inadvertently reveals the secret of the third mistress's affair with Dr. Gao. The first mistress goes to the hotel where a tryst is underway and catches them in flagrante delicto. The master is away, and when Meishan's transgression is exposed, his retainers drag her to the tower and she is hanged. When Songlian discovers what has happened, she goes mad and is seen wandering aimlessly dressed in a schoolgirl's uniform.

A stunningly beautiful film with rich, lavish sets and costumes, breathtaking color, a compelling script based on the novel Wives and Concubines by Wu Tong, and consummate acting. Unfortunately the subtitles on the DVD copy I watched were laughably bad (example: servant is rendered as savant) and interfered with my understanding and enjoyment of the movie. Other reviewers have indicated that there are later and better DVD releases. so my advice is to be careful which version you buy/borrow.
