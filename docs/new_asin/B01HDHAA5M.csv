So, director Mark Evans was sure the devil had a hold of something, he just could not put his finger quite on it, it seems. Lets be fair, if you are not a fan of found footage films, a film like this or even the recent very good Blair Witch is not going to win you over. If you are a fan of the genre like me, you may see this film as proof that the genre is either getting very lazy or that the bottom of the barrel is being used. That is not saying the film is so bad, it is just saying that we have seen it all before. The film opens explaining the events of November 2013. And what happened to a team of filmmakers led by Rachel Kusza. There is this forest named Baciu and it is located in Transylvania. The crew decides in the middle of winter to take the trip and see what this place is all about. The first twenty or so minutes of the film, helps build up this place. Locals and others are interviewed about what is going on in this place. It seems that people are scared of something in this Forest. One person even explains that a girl went in the woods for a few days but came back like she had been gone for over 5 months. The opening segment of the film is from Professor Howard Redman. He was Rachels teacher and when he went looking for her, found her camera. He decided to take his own life after watching the events on this camera, but uploaded the video to the internet before he did so. Basically, he wants everyone who watches this footage to feel suicide is a good remedy for this film. I hate to completely trash this film, because the story element of this film while cliche was easy to sit thru and provided a good enough base to follow the film. Like every found footage film today that exists to modern man, we get an hour plus slow telling story, and about ten to fifteen minutes of horror. I figure this is the formula that they feel realism can be achieved. It happened in the Blair Witch this year and it happens in the smaller films like this. They really rely on the audience to have the patience to want to sit thru the talking, and same scenarios we always get to get to the fun. This film, just seems to go nowhere for the most part. It gives us so many stops in predictable land that I was hoping that this was a smoke screen and they would pull an original idea out of their hats. The icy backdrop provides a great scenario to try and break the mold, but this film just cannot seem to fathom wanting to be risky. The acting in this film was fair. I think the dialogue will feel redundant to some and others will tune out most of it, as they know where it can start and end at. The final fifteen or so minutes, I did like. It had enough eerie moments to really make a decent enough payoff. As you can tell, my emotions for this film are all over the place. A part of me is trying to stomach that this film was entertaining but the other part of me felt that the familiarity was a little too much.",1475625600,,3105,4.103618421052632

8765081,1,B01HDHAA5M,"This is a found footage film from the Hoia Baciu forest, Romania dating to November 2012. Three students enter the forest and never leave as we are informed by the professor who found the film. The forest we are told judges people and decides if they can leave or not. It seems littering is on the top of the list of sins. The film is interview filler for about the first 30 minutes. They walk through SNOW into the forest and get lost because they don't have a map. Seriously? Someone smarter than a fifth grader (or not) could have stepped up and said, ""Hey! We made those tracks. Let's follow them back."" Nope. The film offers no closure, or much of anything.

PLOT SPOILER? There are some trees at the end almost shaped in a V (except for that one tree off to the side) and supposedly it concerns something that we don't see inside the V either. Keep alert for clues, because I expected aliens or a meth lab with cannibals.

""the Devil's Forest"", ""The Devil Complex"" and ""The Devil Within"" are the same film, I would hate to see anyone watch it twice.
