8242993,5,B0011Z1T4E,A movie that'll tear your heart open.  Son si Jin is fantastic as are her co-stars.,1511913600,,83,4.1875
8242994,3,B0011Z1T4E,"Although the male actor falls in love ""at first sight"" with one of the two female characters, by some twist the THREE  become close friends, making the viewer wonder where the plot is going.  I don't think I'd be giving too much of it away to tell you that both girls are sick, so the story becomes slower and more sad to the point of becoming boring despite the sympathy felt for them.  I've seen many sad  Korean dramas which held my attention while I used tissue after tissue, but this wasn't one of them, and I can't tell you exactly why.  If you want to check it out and tell me where I'm wrong, please do so, but I could recommend many others if you want a good cry with a great story.",1348185600,,691,4.126865671641791
8242995,5,B0011Z1T4E,"I don't usually watch Korean love dramas, really very few in my lifetime.  So, I'm not able to compare this movie to the flourishing Korean love drama movies/series of the past decade.  The guy star of the movie was from the very popular ""Sassy Girl"".  I actually saw this movie on a local TV channel, and told my wife to come over and watch it with me.  We definitely watched it to the very end.

Even though this is a story with a ""prototypical"" Korean love triangle, all likable characters, most of the draw is centered around the deep friendship between the two women, who were friends since childhood.  Ji-hwan, an amateur photographer, is smitten by one of the two girls.  After approaching them and loudly confessing his love, they settle on friendship between the three.  Hanging out, and eventually a scenic road trip continue to bring the three closer together as friends, and leads to an undercurrent of love between the guy and one of the girls.  There are definitely a few plot twists, which only add to the touching end of the story.  Remember, Asian love stories rarely end well for all the protagonists - hence the melancholy nature of the genre.  I'm generally jaded by predictable plot twists in movies, but I thought these served the story very well.

What could be confusing for some is the time shifting of the story.  The movie starts out in the present, but is told from recollection, alternating frequently without warning.  You have to watch the context of the scenes carefully to figure out what is present versus past and everything in between.  What I especially liked about the movie was the use of black and white photos and letters.  In this present-age day of email, texting, streaming, and cellphones, it was great to see none of these things in the movie.  The featured camera is an old manual Nikon and the especially poignant scene at the end is Ji-hwan reading a letter from his love.  Very touching last lines...

What also makes this movie a little sadder, is that one of the stars actually died at ~25 y/o in 2005.  I didn't know this when I was watching the movie.  The movie stands on its own merits, but knowing this little tidbit might accentuate the melancholy the second time around.

I found this web searching, and I think it's a pretty good summary without giving away too much:
""One day, Ji-hwan begins to receive letters from an unidentified person. The letters, containing black-and-white photos of happy children playing, remind Ji-hwan of his old two friends.  Five years earlier, while Ji-hwan is taking pictures with his camera, two girls, Soo-in and Gyung-hee, walk into the frame. Ji-hwan falls in love with Soo-in at first sight. He then musters up enough courage to confess his love to her, but she refuses him very politely. Even so, Ji-hwan doesn't give up and tells them that he wants to be friends the next time they meet. Ever since then, the three of them start a wonderful friendship. They spend time each other always, and consider it the most precious moments of their lives. But they become confused between love and friendship and, finally, Gyung-hee and Soo-in leave him without a trace.  The random letters inspire Ji-hwan to depart anxiously on a long journey to find his old friends, but while looking for Soo-in and Gyung-hee, he confronts a beautiful yet sad secret.""",1272585600,5,3344,4.7357512953367875
