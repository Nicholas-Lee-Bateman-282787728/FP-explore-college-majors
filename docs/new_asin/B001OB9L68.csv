8330216,4,B001OB9L68,"I am born and raised in Nicaragua and I have had the opportunity to witness the amazing positive impact of Caf Chavalos in Granada and, more importantly, in the lives of these kids. This is a very honest and accurate documentary, which shows how a couple of deeply loving and generous people can transform a community and the lives of children who were victims of drugs. On another note, if you are expecting a highly technical production and sophisticated documentary maybe ""Caf Chavalos"" is not for you. On the other hand, if you are open to watch a real story narrated with candor and simplicity and to see the face of a new and more hopeful Nicaragua, I am sure you will enjoy this film. My congratulations to Alberto, Donna, Lilly and to ""Los Chavalos"".",1374192000,,758,4.622222222222222
