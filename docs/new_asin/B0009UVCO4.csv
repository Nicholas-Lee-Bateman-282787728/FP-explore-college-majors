2322520,5,B0009UVCO4,"`The Bengali Night"" released in '88 is based on the novel `La nuit bengali' written by Mircea Eliade, one of the most respected experts in religion and sociology of the 20th century. Based on a true story `The Bengali Night' is a masterpiece of existential storytelling; intelligent, articulate and highly mystical. You can almost see the genius mind of Eliade at work.

The film succeeds in capturing all the Occidental, existential angst of Beckett and Sartre while adding a high degree of Indian mysticism thus bringing a texture and flavor to the story. It's absolutely intoxicating. The dialogue is so profound that you'll find yourself backing up the disc now and then to hear the imparted words of wisdom again. Add to this wonderful script the exotic urban landscape of India and a near hypnotic soundtrack, you'll find yourself lost in a world of images you'll want to revisit often. This is truly a hidden cinematic gem waiting to be discovered by ""All the lost sheep who wander through this world."" The only flaw is the DVD itself. The picture is somewhat grainy and spotted, it's definitely in need of a remastering.

Strong performances by Hugh Grant and John Hurt, but the true stars in this film are the two Indian beauties Supriya Pathak as Gayatri and Shabana Azmi as Indira Sen.",1166227200,13,1296,4.833333333333333
2322521,5,B0009UVCO4,"""The Bengali Night"" is a very subtle and beautiful film, where Indian culture has the leading role even if Hugh Grant and John Hurt are both excellent. As the film begins, we are introduced to the world of those expatriates living in India, although there are some, like Hugh Grant's character, Allan, who refuse to absorb this very strong and powerful culture. Allan is an engineer who builds bridges and paves roads with his young European mentality. Yet, there are others like Hurt's character, who instead, embrace the culture to the point that they fall into it; become obsessed by it. So, when Allan becomes ill and is invited to stay at the home of his employer, he dives head first, leaving behind his European past, including friends and a girlfriend. It's not too difficult for him to then fall in love with the boss' daughter, Gayatri, who is beautiful, charming, and the perfect ""guide"" for Allan. However, passion in India between a white man and an Indian woman is not something that is tolerated, and our two lovers are not prepared for the consequences. The film is held together by a wonderful cast, which includes the great Shabana Azmi, one of Indian cinema's greatest stars, along with other actors of Satyajit Ray's team. It was Hugh Grant's first starring role, and his youth and naivety makes his character ever more endearing. Based on a true story between the philosopher Mircea Eliade and Maytrei Davi, who became one of the most important poets of Bengal, the film wraps us up in the flavor and magic of India, and refuses to let go. A beautiful and very powerful film. Phil Ed.",1032134400,28,1605,4.735714285714286
8066926,1,B0009UVCO4,I tried seeing this once ... a terrible waste of talent and actually a rather poor show by Supriya Pathak ... Hugh Grant didn't have much to do and I wonder why Shobana Azmi and Soumitra Chatterjee are even a part of it ... not worth your time or money ...,1487548800,,256,4.03921568627451
8066927,2,B0009UVCO4,"This movie was ok as it did not really capture my attention. I was hoping by the cover that it would be more up to date as it didn't show the release year, but it looks like this film is older.",1406678400,,193,3.731707317073171
8066928,1,B0009UVCO4,It's the most depressing story. Not even sad. It's just such a dark and depressing story leaves the audience hopeless.,1403049600,,118,4.95
8066929,1,B0009UVCO4,"Horrible, one of the worst movies ever. Plot line is stupid, quality is poor, description is misleading. I rented this movie because it starred Hugh Grant, even Hugh couldn't save it. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Don't waste your money.",1394150400,,243,4.545454545454546
8066930,3,B0009UVCO4,fascinating film especially because I met and knew Maitraye Devi personally through many years and she had mentioned to me that she had had a disappointment in her love life - now I know which . She also gave me her book  It will never die,1388361600,,239,4.195652173913044
8066931,2,B0009UVCO4,"I thought this must be okay if Hugh Grant is in it, but I was wrong. The quality of this film is comparable to a bootleg copy recorded by someone in the audience. Seriously? Amazon should not charge to watch this movie. The Bengali scenery was interesting but due to the quality of the video the family begged me to put on something else, so after 30 minutes I did. As such I'll refrain from commenting on the plot (which had not yet emerged).",1350604800,,443,4.285714285714286
8066932,3,B0009UVCO4,"To understand this movie, one has to be familiar with the background of Mircea Eliade, Grant's character. The movie, set around 1928 or 1930s, is based on his true life experience in India. Eliade later became a very renowned scholar of religion and philosophy and a professor at the University of Chicago. He had two gurus, one of them Indian, Shri Surendranath Dasgupta, the top scholar of Philosophy and Region in the 1900s. The Maharaja of Calcutta offered scholarships to European scholars to study in India. Eliade, a Romanian, was selected. He lived in Dasgupta's house during his study years and had a romantic and physical relationship with Dasgupta's daughter Maitreyi (Gayatri in the movie). This is the context of the movie. Eliade and Maitreyi were very much in love. Of course, the relationship was forbidden by any standards in the early 1900s India and this led to tragedy.

This movie is a blur! The story line and the scenes are very unclear even for those who have read Eliade's book. The movie has no subtitles. Subtitles are a must for movies where the characters speak with different accents.

Hugh Grant and Shabana Azmi have done a very good job with their roles. The confusion in Grants' character's face every time he encounters something strange or puzzling about the Indian culture is interesting.

It is very important to listen to the Producer's interview, which is quite an eye-opener. He talks about the specific difficulties he encountered in shooting the movie, the difference in the `concept of time' as experienced by the Indians versus Europeans, the hospitality of the Indians, meeting the real Maitreyi, and law suits by Indians (which they did not pursue). He is still grateful and recommends that everyone visit India. He does describe the culture as bazaar (not his word) as he experienced it- for example, the humongous lunch he was given.

The movie is somewhat disappointing.",1342828800,3,1920,4.990625
8066933,1,B0009UVCO4,"I found this film to be a conglomeration of eccentric characters poorly portrayed. The editor must have been on drugs. The film moves in awkward jerks like a five-car pileup in slow motion. The storyline is predictable and offers nothing to recommend it. The true story has promise as a film, but this production is not it.

Hugh Grant as Allan is a gray, featureless character moving like he's overdosed on Valium. Allan's girlfriend is simply a freak. (None of the relationships are clearly drawn.) John Hurt's talent is wasted on a character of little consequence. Maybe he is supposed to be the comic relief. Supriya Pathak as Gayatri is absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately her beauty cannot save this mess.

The real killer was that the DVD had the quality of a pirated movie. It had the appearance of a an 8-mm home movie copied directly to DVD (in someone's garage). The quality is grainy with extremely harsh contrast: shadows are muddy while highlights are washed out. The colors are garish. Hugh and John's faces break out like acne in lurid tenges of red and yellow. The titles are severely blurred. A line of text that appears at the beginning of the film -- that is meant as an introduction to the film -- is unreadable.

Need I go on?",1220486400,10,1247,4.684931506849315
8066934,1,B0009UVCO4,"I watched this movie with someone of Bengali descent. Both of us agreed within 10 minutes that the film was not good.  Within a half hour it was nothing less than excruciating to watch.

""The Bengali Night"" is just an awkward movie.  The characters are odd, inexplicable, and just downright weird.  John Hurt's character in particular  borders on creepy.  The conflict between Grant's character and the daughter's father is telegraphed very early on.

This film is not a ""classic"" regardless of what others might claim.  Just look on rottentomatoes and you'll see that not a single reviewer even bothered with this rather unknown film.  I'm not saying this as either a snob or as someone who doesn't like great movies.  I appreciate everything from ""Casablanca"" to ""Brokeback Mountain"" to ""Speed.""  That's how bad this movie is.

If you love Hugh Grant and want to see something from his early days then this might be an interesting watch.  He has a rather odd accent in this film and it does show him getting his acting chops.  Everyone else should probably stay away from this film like the plague.

Edit: I know that this movie has roots in the real life story of two academics, Devi and Eliade, who fell in love in their youth and were separated by Devi's traditional Indian father.  The true story is tragic, but little of that is depicted in this odd film.  It simply makes this movie seem even more flawed - there was enough story here for a classic and the director simply failed to deliver.",1212537600,9,1499,4.681992337164751
8066935,3,B0009UVCO4,"If you want a look at life in India, way back when. this movie supplies that. As far as entertainment goes, it's just so-so.",1173312000,,124,4.208333333333333
