4091802,5,B0038P1D5A,This is a must-have DVD!  All of the comedians are hilariously funny.  Kevin Hart's stand up comedy is timeless! If you watch this DVD you seriously won't be able to stop laughing for even a second.  The compilation of comedians is awesome because you get a mix of different types of jokes.  There truly is something for everyone!  I highly recommend buying this DVD!,1282608000,3,367,4.671875
4091803,4,B0038P1D5A,"I just got this DVD in the mail and couldn't wait to watch it. This is one of the funniest videos I've seen in a long time. It features five great comedians, each with their own brand of comedy. They happen to be three black guys and two white guys, so there is something for everybody. My personal favorite was Eric Schwartz. Chocolate Sundaes is actually a weekly comedy showcase at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. I'm glad they're starting with their earlier shows kind of how SNL did with their DVDs. I hope to see more from them soon.",1282003200,,541,4.366336633663367
4091804,3,B0038P1D5A,"Well, this DVD banks on Katt Williams... but it's 20 minutes of his old material, presented much better in ""The Pimp Chronicles"" release. Katt even mentions ""It's 2004"" and Sam Tripoli's cracking Kobe Bryant jokes to put a date on things. It would have been much better to try and get this released earlier, but now it's just a cash-in attempt. The best part of this DVD was Aries Spears, he was amazing if you'd never seen him outside of Mad TV.

Anyway, a 2004 show released on DVD in 2008? As a variety show, it works but pass if you're watching for Katt Williams and seen any of his DVDs already.",1281312000,18,600,4.357142857142857
4091831,3,B0038P1D5A,"Good to see Katt during his early years.  Truly the best.  Audience sucks.... not sure if its the recording but it sounds like theres a bunch of people talking all through it in the backgroud, like back by the bar.  really distracting.",1421020800,,235,4.5476190476190474

4091840,1,B0038P1D5A,Not as funny as I hope MATTER OF FACT It was AWFUL. The only funny comedian is Aries Spears from that hit comedy show MAD TV,1364515200,,124,3.8076923076923075
