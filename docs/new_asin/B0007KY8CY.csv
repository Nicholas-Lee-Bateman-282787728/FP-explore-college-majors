8047828,3,B0007KY8CY,This fitness circle isn't the most comfortable - too much metal and I find that the pads could be more comfortable as well. I've since found another type that works better for me.,1428105600,,179,4.454545454545454
8047829,2,B0007KY8CY,"I can almost always find some worth in the things I buy, but unfortunately this purchase was just a mistake for me and I'm afraid it would be for many.  The pace on this DVD is very slow.  It's simply not an energetic atmosphere.  It is for people who are brand-new to Pilates.  Anyone who is in even moderately good shape will likely find this a bit too slow-paced and not challenging enough to warrant being incorporated into their routine.  I didn't even find anything I could incorporate into my other workouts.

I truly dislike giving anything a rating this low so here are the positives:  the instructor is pleasant.  The production value is reasonably good and here is the one fully positive thing: there is a segment at the beginning that offers thorough instruction on form.  It is not a fast-paced or pressured DVD at all and the atmosphere is encouraging.  I'd say it might be good for seniors trying Pilates for the first time, but realistically, it does require some flexibility, including (oddly) having to sit cross-legged for portions of the workout.

It's an older DVD, the menu is not as clear as it could be and again, it's a bit dull.  However, if someone is a true beginner, they might enjoy it.  I do think they would outgrow it very quickly.  I still have mine, but have no reason to watch it again so I will be donating it to a local community center.  I am sorry to nearly pan something.  This DVD might be good for a group, new to exercise that needs a very gentle pace.",1372550400,2,1496,4.464944649446495
8047830,4,B0007KY8CY,A simple but effective workout.  I don't mind doing these exercises. The exercises are  well explained and the repetitions are not overly long.,1325980800,,143,5.173913043478261
8047831,2,B0007KY8CY,The Circle Flow was cheaply made and not what I expected it to be.  It was not easy to handle and not very pliable.  The CD was ho-hum at best,1319414400,,142,3.7
8047832,4,B0007KY8CY,"I purchased this Pilates workout because I had a fitness ring and needed a workout to go with it.  This is a very calming workout.  I love to do it before bed.  I often have a sore back and shoulders at the end of the day.  By doing this workout and stretching my arms and back, I always feel much better.  The workout is simple, yet gives me a good stretch.  The only thing that I don't like is that it is always the same 30 minute routine.  I wish that there were more routines included on this CD.",1286236800,3,500,3.98989898989899
8047833,1,B0007KY8CY,"I thought this would be a good video for intermediate.  It is for beginners and she talks, A LOT, it is very slow and you waste time while she talks about herself.  When you get to the excerises they aren't that advanced, so I didn't get a work out.  If you have never done Pilates, then go it, otherwise don't bother.",1281830400,11,318,4.180327868852459
8047834,3,B0007KY8CY,"""Fitness Circle Flow"" is a good workout to do if you are looking to tone and firm your stomach and inner and outer thighs. None of the exercises are too difficult so I'd recommend this for beginners or anyone who enjoys Pilates. Some of the exercises include breathing exercises, cat/cow, the one hundred, scissors, roll up, spine twist, single leg stretch, spine stretch and mermaid. Most of the exercises are unique because you are using a fitness circle. This workout would be good for anyone seeking variety in their workouts as most of the exercises in this workout will be new. The cueing is also good and the instructor is pleasant. On the downside most of the exercises don't have very many reps so that might frustrate anyone who is advanced and is looking to feel the burn.

8047835,5,B0007KY8CY,This is a good core workout - I take my ring when I travel for work; with this DVD and my computer...I'm good to go!,1209772800,3,116,3.68
8047836,5,B0007KY8CY,This DVD takes you to the next level of the Magic Circle. It is challenging and takes you to the next level after you have mastered pilates mat work. You cannot go wrong with any Stott DVD's. Educational for both the instructors and the general population.,1162684800,17,256,4.586956521739131
