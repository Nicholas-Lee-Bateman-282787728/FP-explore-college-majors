8758605,1,B01EGQ6NFO,"For a workout that is touted to be a cardio work it sure puts you to sleep.
Too many pauses, to  much talking and the workout itself is mediocre

I did other workouts like Jillian Michaels, Sean T and Les Mils but they all  blow this out of the water.
I know everyone cant be in Sean T's class for cardio, but this bores you.
Was looking for a Tae Kwon Do Workout to sweat out and do some kicking at the same but this workout quality is below plenty that i see on Youtube for free.",1512950400,,481,3.9381443298969074
