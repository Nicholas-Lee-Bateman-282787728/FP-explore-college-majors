8349405,4,B0021SGOG8,"If you are a fan of gritty crime dramas in the vein of Reservoir Dogs, you will more than likely enjoy this Colombian film. While the Amazon synopsis for the film isn't entirely accurate, what is true is that this is a movie that will keep you in suspense until its unpredictable finale.

Cali, Colombia native actors scar Borda and Marlon Moreno both offer great performances as criminals Eusebio and Victor (respectively). Despite only having a strong career in Colombian television, Borda shines as the intense but likeable hood that falls victim to something much more mysterious than street violence.

If you enjoy thrillers with a healthy dose of gangsters and black comedy thrown in, this is a great DVD to own. I've seen my fair share of low-budget Colombian movies that didn't bite, Dog Eat Dog is the first with real teeth.",1352764800,,833,4.818181818181818
