2677103,5,B000JLTSD0,"I normally don't address opinions put forth by other reviewers -- and when I do, I try to do so with respect and tolerance, which is the spirit in which I'm writing this.

The review below labels this with a 'yawn', and found it boring and pointless...?  Anyone whose life has even been touched by sexual abuse -- either personally, or through a loved one being victimized -- will understand the amount of courage it took for Celesta Davis and her family to go through with contacting and confronting the man who abused her when she was a child.  My best friend is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse -- I've seen courage in her over the past 9 years that has amazed me.  I'm proud to call her my hero.

Rather than being a fictionalized and sensationalized piece of 'Hollywood entertainment', AWFUL NORMAL is a well-made, deeply moving documentary that pulls no punches.  Confronting one's abuser -- either immediately or after years of suffering the effects of the abuse -- is one of the most emotionally shattering, painful moves a survivor can make...and one of the most empowering and healing.  It doesn't matter if the resulting confrontation isn't an ultra-dramatic scene involving the offender throwing himself on his knees in front of her and begging for forgiveness -- the sheer act of the survivor finding the strength and courage to open up and speak about the abuse publicly is a big step in closing old wounds.

The film shows the entire painful, painstaking process -- making the decision to find the abuser and make contact, wavering between courage and despair right up to the last moment, tearful, open-hearted discussions between Celesta, her mother and her sister.  No punches are pulled, and no attempt seems to have been made to falsely portray courage or resolve that wasn't there 100% of the time.

This is a brutally honest, powerful and important film -- and as important as it was for Celesta to make the decision to confront her abuser, then to follow through on such a daunting task, it's just as important that this film be seen widely, so that more people can understand just how much damage can be done...and what courage it takes to heal.  Maybe then we'd hear fewer people say callous things like 'Oh...she just needs to get over it.'

Please.  This wasn't meant to be 'entertaining'.",1165276800,42,2319,4.7675
2677104,1,B000JLTSD0,"Boring women put their boring lives on display, or not, maybe that's the problem, you really get no idea what so ever what these people are truly all about.  It does seem that they pick apart and analyze the one bad event from their near-perfect vanilla lives until you just want to choke the TV.  The daughters confront their childhood abuser, get no real answers, no revelations, no picture for a good portion (black screen --only sound).....and  It clocks in with 75 minutes of lame, purposeless, tedium...they could barely fill........

If you enjoyed Capturing The Friedman's fast pace and deep story telling than you will be disappointed with this film.",1162598400,8,659,4.963636363636364
2677135,1,B000JLTSD0,"This documentary is the worst.  Firstly these girls clearly were not only abused by this man but also by their father, which they and their mother are in 100% denial about.  Regardless of the decade this crime occurred in any mother in their right mind would do anything in their power to protect their children from harm, one parental responsibility their mother failed them on by keeping them in contact with this man and their father their whole childhood.  What sick and demented adults these were.  CPS should have had custody of these kids.  secondly what a coward the parents were that didn't have this man arrested he is obviously a repeat offender.  He showed no remorse for what he did and I believe that he honestly doesn't care.  The way the younger sister acted so emotionally attached to this man and then said she loved him, the only thing this documentary portrayed to me was how effed up this family is and always will be.  Lastly the mother leaves by hugging the man who molested her children and by telling him that she loves the great things about him.  My mother would never, I could never.  What in the world is wrong with people.  The only thing you can hope is that these girls don't end up like the pathetic parents who raised them.  Much more appreciative of my mother after watching this movie.",1317254400,7,1321,4.574468085106383
2677136,4,B000JLTSD0,It is an awful shame that any person could watch the touching personal accounts of someones life and consider it to be boring or a yawner.  I was a preditor and I now know how my actions can be carried by the victoms for so long.  I never wanted to hurt anyone but I guess I ended up hurting everyone.  There is nothing normal about hurting someone else.  I was touched and moved by the story and the prosect of closure.,1313193600,3,420,4.148148148148148
2677137,5,B000JLTSD0,"While Difficult to watch, I felt this film gave me insight into how sick people really are- and how to recognize the signs of an abuser.  As a parent, I felt this documentary was informative, insightful, and deep.  When watching, you realize how the cycle of abuse not only perpetuates and recycles but manipulates its way into normalcy.  There are so many people in our  inner circles like Alan- can we recognize the very skilled manipulator?  I still don't think Alan will ever understand the gravity of the depth of pain he caused others, but he is just too sick to do so- he might actually be a sociopath.
  Seeing this film makes me never want to leave my children alone- not even for 5 minutes.  It was only a few minutes in which a traumatic sexual encounter brought Celesta and her sister to years of unbearable pain.  Parents, please believe your children when they are trying to hint at something.  And please don't leave them with anyone.  Most children are abused by those they know- a friend or relative.",1312416000,2,1017,4.594444444444444
2677138,4,B000JLTSD0,"I agree 100% with Laura Killilea. She saw all the things I did. Indiana Jules was also right on target with the truth. And what Larry Looney said needed desperately to be said. How could anyone take on such a flippant attitude as a few on here have to call something so horrendous as what these ppl went through  ""boring"". The only thing that I can add that they may not have noticed (it may not have been on here at the time)is that the amazon adds to the right of the reviews were for movies that are nothing more than child porn. I have the titles written down & will be contacting amazon about this. Oh how pervasive this SIN of selfishness is! It appears that amazon knows that pervos will be watching these films to find the weak spots of their victims. Anything for a buck.",1309046400,,780,4.27027027027027
2677139,4,B000JLTSD0,"This was painful to watch and I can't see how she got any real ""closure.""  I waited and waited throughout the abuser's ""heart-to-heart"" with her and not once, NOT ONCE, did he ever say he was sorry!  He said a lot, but I disagree with the filmmakers that he ""owned"" the abuse.  I didn't feel he showed any remorse whatsoever.  And she displayed the classic symptoms of being emotionally tied to her abuser when she told the others she ""loved"" him after she stayed behind to chat with him alone.  I think both these girls were given some confusing mixed signals while growing up.  Since what decade (ANY decade?) has it been OK for little girls to play with their father's penises?  I nearly choked when she said that.  I think the younger sister showed a much healthier angry disposition toward the abuser.  I hope Celesta is in long-term counseling.",1306713600,9,850,4.613333333333333
2677140,3,B000JLTSD0,"How do you rate a film like this?  Certainly a 5 for execution, bravery and and being so truly raw.  But to click on ""I Love It"" doesn't feel right does it?  So I selected ""It's OK,"" because I hope it will be for the people in this film and I wish it could be for everyone who ever experienced abuse.

I have a bit of a morbid fascination with extreme human experiences and have even felt that in my perusal of footage featuring people in peril, I had grown a bit desensitized. I can watch footage of a real person dying violently almost without batting an eye, thanks to so much exposure, but I had to stop watching/listening when the dam broke at the end of this documentary.  After all I've seen, I think indeed in all my life, I have not witnessed anguish like that in the cries of these two sisters.  It was chilling, unnerving.  I'm glad to know that Celesta feels she experienced closure and positive changes in the wake of such a bold, courageous move to be proactive about her pain, but I was left feeling totally discouraged.  It's easier when you can just feel anger at the ""bad guy.""  When you look at the true story behind real life psychological trauma, it is never so black and white as we want it to be.

These little girls were left in a miserable hell inside the bodies of these women all these years and I hope they can be freed.  And I wish that anytime anyone anywhere decided to give into the impulse to abuse a child in any way, they would be forced to experience the brand of grief we've seen here for just a moment. Maybe they really are unfeeling monsters, but I like to think it would stop them dead in their tracks.

Then again, many people who inflict this abuse on others do so because it was done to them.  So surely they HAVE felt their grief.  I wonder what makes some victims turn that misery into their own acts of cruelty while others simply suffer.  Ugh, the title is ever so wretchedly apropos.",1303171200,8,1932,4.2837465564738295
2677141,1,B000JLTSD0,"Being molested is obviously bad, very bad. But why make a documentary about being molested by a family friend, but be a-ok with as the filmmaker said ""we were a very open family...i played with his [father's] penis.""?",1298678400,4,217,4.7368421052631575
2677142,4,B000JLTSD0,Flawed but very compelling docu about a tight knit group of women who confront their abuser of approximately twenty five years previous . Fascinating streaming . Most women and (i'm sure) many men can identify . It need not have happened to you to appreciate the story and people involved .,1295395200,3,290,4.705882352941177
2677143,2,B000JLTSD0,"I found this video to be VERY boring and slow-moving.  The abuse that the women suffered pales greatly in comparisson to the other case histories I have heard about in videos and books, not saying it wasn't a serious offense and didn't effect her greatly, but it wasn't what I expected in a video that dealt solely with her 'recovery' and 'healing'.  The documentary was very slow moving and choppy.",1221523200,4,399,4.685714285714286
2677144,5,B000JLTSD0,"I give this movie 5 stars because I admire the courage of Celesta in confronting the man who molested her.  I think she did a service for all people who have been molested.  She showed them (us) a way to get their power back.

  Celesta's mother knew about the abuse of her daughters but continued to be friends with the molester and expose her daughters to him.  Celesta calls this behavior 'protective' because it was the 1970's and that was what people did, just went on and pretended nothing happened.  If that doesn't make sense to you that's because it doesn't make sense.  Those are the words of a woman who cannot face that her mother did not protect her from a child abuser. At the end of Celesta's confrontation with the molester, her mother hugs him and says, ""I love the good things about you.""  What a kick in the gut for her daughters.  To me, this is the real story; a daughter's remarkable contortion of reality in order to avoid the pain of her mother's horrible betrayal.",1176163200,27,989,4.4748603351955305

If you haven't been through something like this then you probably won't get it or see the worth in it. It was very helpful for me in my process of getting past what happened to me. I think that it took a tremendous amount of courage for the girls to tell their story and have cameras there shooting when they were being so vulnerable. Thanks for making this.

8151979,1,B000JLTSD0,"these two sisters comfront their molester after 20 + years  -  I did not see a lot of  sincerity in this movie by them ; they acted like they were playing childish games  laughing and joking ;  and seem to show sympathy towards the abuser - almost as if they enjoyed what happened to them. to me NOTHING was accomplished by this ""quest"" they made -a waste of time",1389312000,2,363,4.202898550724638
8151980,1,B000JLTSD0,"I'll skip the usual fine print about how child molestation is not okay, but I think that's pretty obvious.
Having said that, good god -- what was the point of this endless and self-indulgent film?  These women are not interesting (and they certainly don't know how to edit themselves).  I can understand how seeking ""closure"" (today's de rigueur catchword) in public could provide, well, closure, but I'm not buying this at all.  I smelled lots of posturing for the camera -- three silly women, one with pigtails, plotting to show up at the guy's house...  Giggling and wringing their hands making hang-up calls. Lots of overhyped sturm und drang about the whole setup and making the confrontation  happen...  When it really was all about going to some senior center and knocking on the door. Why the build-up, other than an hour of digital video is cheap?

... and then...

the confrontation happens! And the movie still drags on for six lifetimes.  The guy immediately apologizes and asks what he can do. She wrings her hand and shakes her pigtails and coyly makes side glances at the camera. She doesn't know.  What would make you feel better? He asks (I'm asking this too..  what's the point now?)  and she just doesn't know.
The sister and the mother go outside and hug through a blurry lens... One or the other whines.  Then the screen reads ""20 minutes later"" and... <drumroll> one of them is sobbing.

The movie drags on further.

Maybe when I wake up next her fingernails will have grown 2 millimeters, and we know that this will be chronicled.  I felt a little abused here, and not just from boredom. I smell drama queen who wanted 15 hours of fame. It wasn't 15 hours? Sure felt like it.",1348185600,3,1698,4.647651006711409
8151981,4,B000JLTSD0,"The Amazon customer review entitled ""Highly, Speculative Pop-Psychology"" by G. Campbell in reference to the documentary [Awful Normal ] shows a strong bias on the part of the reviewer that limits his ability to give a fair review. The reviewer questions whether there is  evidence that the man the Davis women are confronting is actually a child molester, even though the abuser (Alan) in the documentary freely admits and describes in graphic detail how he forced a 5 year old girl (Celesta Davis) to perform oral sex on him and how he put his mouth on and groped her vagina. The abuser, Alan, seemed to be enjoying the attention of the confrontation and did not appear genuinely contrite. It is disturbing that this reviewer spends 3/4 of his review questioning whether the Davis sisters were ""legitimate victims"" and that he (the reviewer) ""refuses to let these women off the hook for using this as a crutch for 30 years"". In the documentary, it is clear that Karen and Celesta Davis do not view their abuse experiences as a ""crutch"".  They are making this documentary to break their long silence about the abuse, reach closure, and inspire others to speak out about their own abuse in order to protect children from pedophiles.  In addition, this reviewer makes other disturbing comments that convey his personal bias.  Anyone who viewed this documentary from beginning to end can see that there is NO REASON for statements from the reviewer like 'the alleged abuser"" and accusing the Davis sisters of a ""frenzy of speculation"" and ""bashing those (in reference to the abuser) who cannot defend themselves"" -- when their abuser, Alan, admits not only to his specific abuse of the girls but to also being a pedophile.  The abuser, Alan, also states that one of the reasons he moved to an Over 60 Retirement Apartment community was to remove himself from areas where there are children.  The reviewer who titles his review of [Awful Normal ] as """"Highly, Speculative Pop-Psychology"" strongly indicates he is biased toward and has sympathy with a man (Alan) who sexually abused children and confesses openly to being a child molester.  I wonder why this reviewer has no sympathy with Karen and Celesta Davis who, as adults, are courageously working towards healing by confronting their abuser? The major shortcoming in the documentary, as a tool for advocacy, is that Celesta Davis also had too much sympathy for her abuser and was far too friendly, when she needed to communicate the evil and lasting damage her abuser created.  It is clear why it was difficult for Celesta Davis to assert herself when people like the amazon customer reviewer who wrote ""Highly Speculative Pop-Psychology"" convey sympathy with pedophiles and question whether true victims of sexual abuse are ""legitimate victims"".  Sexual Abuse of children is widely under-reported as it is, and unethical reviews like ""Highly Speculative Pop-Psychology"" only contribute to a culture of silence/denial and allow pedophiles to continue to abuse children.",1348012800,6,3021,5.050200803212851
8151982,1,B000JLTSD0,"This ""documentary"" documents a cast of women each playing their own hyped-up roles of ""victim"". I need to clearly state that I feel for them and what happened to them was wrong. That being said, their abuse does not give them license to use this as an excuse for their behavior for the rest of their lives. 30 years later, this dominates their lives and is blamed for everything bad thing that has ever happened to them. Furthermore, this film is agonizingly slow and has too numerous faults to mention. But I'll try:

1) Celeste and her sister, Karen, seem like legitimate victims who are out for a payday. Kind of like the legitimate victims that cry on Jerry Springer. While they may have convinced themselves and others of the nobility of bringing these revelations to the forefront, they do so for, in my opinion, less than altruistic reasons.

2) The mother perpetuates this cycle of victimhood. She enabled this abuse to occur, and only when a payday is on the horizon, seems concerned. Puh-lease!

3) From the start of the film, we are supposed to just aceept these girls' recollection of events as fact. While I do not doubt that this abuse occurred in some capacity, these women seem to feed off eachother and, like ""the telephone game"", gets a little different each time this is discussed. Which leads me to:

4) The most outrageous scene was when the women confront the ex-wife and daughter of the alleged abuser. They sit around the dinner table and feed off eachother in a frenzy of speculation of past transgressions. The ex-wife has no trouble bashing her ex-husband, the daughter does not seem to fond of her dad, the mother of the sisters explains why she is not at fault, and the two sisters bounce ideas back and forth as to who may have done what 30 years ago WITH ZERO CONSIDERATION OF THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF EVIDENCE. Most outrageously, they pick on their dead father, as he is not their to defend himself, and speculate that maybe he abused them because they found their dad's porno stash. At the crescendo of the witch hunt, the daughter of the abuser says that since her brother is a convicted pedophile, he must have been abused by their father because ""you learn what you experience"". I had no idea these women were forensic psychologists! Because if they're not, this is just five women sitting around a dinner table, bashing those who cannot defend themselves and working themselves up into a frenzy with the shottiest of speculative pop psychology. I almost turned it off at this point. I wish I would have.

5) These women use this abuse to explain why they have never done anything with their lives and why they can't make it work with a man. While I am not discounting abuse as a psychological injury, I refuse to let these women off the hook for using this as a crutch for 30 years and never picking themselves up off the ground.

6) After they ambush... I mean, confront, their abuser, he is contrite and expresses remorse. He has discussed this heinous act in the past and has, presumably, believed this matter to be put to rest when he was first confronted with this 30 years ago. Despite his contrition and willingness to ""do whatever"" they want as an act of contrition, it appears the real aim is to bitch at him for 30 years while never actually trying to move passed it. These women are not looking for closure, they're looking for a crutch on which to hang all their problems and a payday.

Overall, while these women were the victims of sexual abuse and such abuse is absolutely wrong, these women are hardly the poster children for how to confront their past. Save your money and your time.",1333929600,4,3633,4.597222222222222

Worth watching, it challenges what one thinks about how to deal with the whole situation and hopefully, how far we have come?",1324425600,4,453,4.625
