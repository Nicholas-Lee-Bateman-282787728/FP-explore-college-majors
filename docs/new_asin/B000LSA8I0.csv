8164079,5,B000LSA8I0,"Not to be confused as a compilation DVD of his greatest video hits.  This presentation represents  a complete and thorough documentary of Hans Holzel, aka; ""Falco"". ""Hoch Wie Nie"" (Higher Than Ever) traces Falco's  roots from his childhood to his early days as a bassist in the band ""Hallucination Company"" during the late 70's. Also covered quite extensively is his rise to the top of the heap during the A&M years of the mid 80's with his chart topping hit ""Rock Me Amadeus"".  The viewer is also allowed to go behind the scenes during the making of some of his music videos with extensive interviews not only with Falco, but those who worked with him throughout his illustrious career. Falco's ""Egoist"" days of the 90's are also covered with rare video footage and discussion, as well as coverage of his tragic death in 1998.  Sometimes controversial, sometimes political, sometimes reckless but never boring. Falco was always massively entertaining and deserving of a documentary of this size and scope.  The world will miss this mega-talented artist.

note to U.S. consumers;  this is a PAL region 2 DVD with no English subtitles.  Meaning; you'll need a code free DVD player and a fairly good understanding of the German language as very few interviews are in English, and the ones that are were dubbed over in German.
