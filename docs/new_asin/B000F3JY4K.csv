8116870,4,B000F3JY4K,"In KILLER ON BOARD, an all-star cast sets out on a luxury cruise, unaware that they're about to get far more than they paid for. Some stowaways have come aboard, infected w/ a lethal virus! Just imagine an episode of LOVE BOAT, loaded w/ soap opera situations, suddenly stricken w/ a fast-spreading disease, and you're pretty close to nailing this one. Patty Duke (THE SWARM), Susan Howard (TV's DALLAS), Jane Seymour (SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER), George Hamilton (THE DEAD DON'T DIE), William Daniels (SARAH T.: PORTRAIT OF A TEENAGE ALCOHOLIC), Claude Aikins (TARANTULAS: THE DEADLY CARGO) , Murray Hamilton (JAWS), and Bonnie Bartlett (TV's ST. ELSEWHERE) help to brighten up this dire situation. One big plus for KILLER ON BOARD is the speed w/ which the virus spreads, causing certain death. Within minutes, the victims start piling up, and dread and doom ensue. Patty Duke bickers w/ Susan Howard, and George Hamilton shows off his tan. William Daniels plays the same crusty role he always plays, and Murray Hamilton reprises his wimpy Mayor role from JAWS, while portraying the ship's doctor. Jane Seymour radiates beauty, as usual, while playing the tour director. Not bad, especially for lovers of cheeeze on the high seas...",1451779200,,1239,5.019417475728155
8116871,5,B000F3JY4K,"Killer On Board is a 1970's made for television soap opera/disaster film, with a typical star filled cast. On a cruise ship a virus strikes and the drama is on. Patty Duke plays a mother who's son becomes ill. One harrowing scene has her being thrown down a flight of stairs. As always she does a nice job.",1376006400,,306,4.293103448275862
8116872,2,B000F3JY4K,"Your average 1970's made for TV movie. Not the best clarity as it's VHS. I bought it because my mother and I were extras in it. Shot aboard the SS Monterey (of the Matson Line) in April/May of 1977 while cruising the Hawaiian Islands.
The actors, movie crew ('Hi' to Dennis) and ship's crew ('Hi' to Roy & Scotty!) were all friendly and nice. We were paid well as extras. I was almost seven months pregnant at the time. (that child is 32 this year!)  It was a fun experience! Worth a viewing.
