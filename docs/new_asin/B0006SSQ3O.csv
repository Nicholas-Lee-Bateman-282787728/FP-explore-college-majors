2194132,5,B0006SSQ3O,"I first saw Mr. Vaughn's performance as FDR at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. many years ago. I had always recognized him a fine actor and had always enjoyed him in movies and on tv. I had no idea, however, that he was a world class stage actor. His extraordinary, thoughtful and moving portrayal of one our most controversial and beloved of presidents totally convinced me of that. Respectful, truthful, and dynamic both the play and his performance bring one of our most controversial and historically significant presidents to life. Whether one hated him or loved him (and few were in between) this is a life worthy of examination. This production provides excellent insight to do just that. And it's also one heck of an evening at the theatre. If you enjoyed James Whitmore's Truman or Christopher Plummer's Barrymore you are in for a similar treat with FDR",1283385600,5,871,4.852348993288591
2194133,5,B0006SSQ3O,"If you're a ""Man From U.N.C.L.E. fan and a political junkie like me, you must own this!  I remember it aired on HBO in 1982 right after I bought my 1st VCR, it was the first thing I recorded.  This one man show gives you a great idea of how it must have been to be around FDR in person and what a great actor Robert Vaughn is.",1274918400,4,326,3.7794117647058822

8042785,3,B0006SSQ3O,"I enjoyed Vaughn performance.  The script is a little slow.  For an FDR fan, they will enjoy a unique performance.  For history fans or students, I don't think I would recommend it.",1428537600,,181,4.59375
8042786,5,B0006SSQ3O,I saw this on TV about 20 years ago and really thought it was fantastic.  I was amazed when I saw that it was availabless on DVD.  I hoped I would like it as much as I remembered and I did.  RV does an amazing job as FDR and brings him to life.  I can't recommend it enough.,1419984000,,274,3.6724137931034484

8042789,5,B0006SSQ3O,"Originally had this show on VHS, but lost the tape years ago.  Was actually surprised it was available on DVD.  Vaughn is an amazing actor and he is extremely convincing as FDR.  And the quality is quite good, given this was a recording of a live stage show.  Could not be happier with it.",1403827200,,289,4.296296296296297
8042790,5,B0006SSQ3O,"Robert Vaughn does an uncanny FDR in this superb one man show. Clearly a theatrical production -not a movie- but nevertheless: if James Whitmore won an Oscar for his Truman soliloquy, Vaughn too deserves one for his Roosevelt.",1401148800,,226,4.973684210526316
8042791,5,B0006SSQ3O,"Simply put, unique. Robert Francis Vaughn's portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt,the most important man in the XX century, is a fascinating take on the life of a man who, like the actor, represent a unique an most American of figures. This is funny, well written, flawlessly acted, a one man tour d' force, and way superior to anything that comes out of theatre nowadays. Bravo!",1388448000,,375,4.7846153846153845
8042792,4,B0006SSQ3O,I saw this when it first aired on HBO circa. 1981. I felt Vaughn captured an element that was in essence F.D.R. Regards.,1385596800,,120,4.260869565217392

No one could possibly equal this performance. I sent one to my long distant family and they were equally as impressed.",1385337600,,218,4.475
