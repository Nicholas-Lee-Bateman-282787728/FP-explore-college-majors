8528588,3,B008JEJSDO,"Gee!...Trash as trash can be! A Trailershow for Trashfans & B-Movie lovers!
Famous People of this genre are the hosts for a bunch of Trailer!
For me,it wasn't enough - sorry. I wish,there was some Interviews of these Genre-stars or some Trailer of her own movies.
Nothing. And so you've got a lot of treasure-trailer,not more.
Nice party-dvd for grindhouse-fans & Drive In lovers!",1379548800,,380,4.953125
8528589,3,B008JEJSDO,"If you answered anytime the trailers aren't on, you'd be correct.  While it is a great trailer compilation, Mad Ron's... had too much Happy and Sum-Otha-Dude (not Mad Ron) cracking horrible puns and bad-makeup zombies shuffling around a theater.  Celluloid Bloodbath is the sequel and, luckily, they do away with the bad puns and the zombie movie goers.  Instead, they try to cram in many b-movie and grindhouse industry vets and scholars introducing single trailers or whole sections of trailers, grouped together by sub-genre.  Some are great (Linnea Quigley), others are just as corny as the bad puns from Mad Ron's..., most aren't on screen enough for you to absorb the fact that you saw them, which is a problem for trailer compilations.  A trailer compilation is supposed to jump between trailers, not have little interludes of talking heads blurting out little phrases and then jumping back to the trailers.  ON TOP OF THIS, the DVD isn't chaptered by single trailer, but instead by the aforementioned sub-genre sections.  I've bought some cheap trailer compilations, but even the cheapest of them had each single trailer chaptered out.  The silver lining is that there are some rarer trailers on here and the quality, while not prestine, isn't copied VHS quality (on most).  If you already own all the ""42nd Street Forever"" discs and ""Stephen Romano Presents Shock Festival"" and ""Mad Ron's Prevues From Hell""...well, then you've probably already ordered ""Celluloid Bloodbath"" and it doesn't matter what I write.  If you don't own those others, buy those before you get ""Celluloid Bloodbath""",1362009600,8,1598,5.135135135135135

8528591,4,B008JEJSDO,"This was a decent horror movie trailer compilation. Had a couple of more rare trailers not seen in other trailer compilation sets.
However one trailer was a cut version,but luckily was one I've seen before. Some of the people introducing the trailers are seen only once while others appear at least 3 times introducing different sets of trailers. Has a few extras,but have barely gone through them,but is mainly bloopers and trailers for other releases. This is a sequel to the 1987 vhs horror trailer compilation tape:Mad Ron's Prevues From Hell. The Zombie ventriloquist dummy returns from the first video,but is seen less and without his human companions from the first video. The trailers are all watchable quality,but seem to be copied off of video tape since they're mainly full screen. Some trailers look better than others though. Sage Stallone(Late actor and son of Sylvester Stallone and owner of Grindhouse Releasing)'s name appears in the closing credits,but the only trailer I recall seeing released through Grindhouse Releasing was a brief trailer for Cannibal Holocaust. In fact all these trailers seemed pretty brief for the most part,but then the people introducing them usually only ended up saying a few sentences in between trailers. I recommend this one since this does have some trailer rarities that look like exclusives to this dvd.",1355184000,,1356,5.168181818181818
8528592,5,B008JEJSDO,Just like Prevues From Hell this brings a ton of awesome obscure trailers. I would recommend this to anyone who is planning on having some friends over or for a rabid horror fan.,1354060800,,178,4.424242424242424
8528593,4,B008JEJSDO,"This is the follow-up to the classic horror trailer collection 'Mad Ron's Prevues From Hell' that featured a GREAT collection trailers which were occasionally broken up by cheesy segments with a balding ventriloquist and his lame zombie puppet 'Happy'. Unfortunately the zombie puppet returns here but at least he's not in it much. What you get are another GREAT selection of horror trailers (some with sexual content) that are lots of fun and even though I'm a HUGE horror trailer fan and have seen most of them that exist, there were still some trailers here that are very obscure and it was a pleasant surprise to see them for the first time.

There are frequent short segments between the trailers featuring various people involved in the horror movie industry - mostly on the super low-budget end and probably friends / associates of the people who made this. Some were interesting and informative segments but there were several that I think are guaranteed to grate on most peoples' nerves, especially some of the more repulsive 'goth' girls who ramble on with their personal soap boxes. Some goth girls are hot but these are not. There are some really cool surprises like segments featuring underground movie aficionado Ken Kish (creator of the VERY awesome 'Cinema Wasteland Convention') who gives some humorous info about upcoming 'sexploitation' trailers. Some people on here really made me cringe, for instance carpetbagger 'Amy Lynn Best' who actually despises horror fans, rails on horror movies for having 'women victims' and mocks horror fans in her 'no budget' movies, yet here she suddenly tries to sound like the biggest horror fan and says crowd pleasing things to impress those who don't know that she looks down on horror fans.

For the most part this a fun trip through the outrageous world of bizarre retro horror trailers that would be perfect to play at parties (it's a great way to clear out the prudes). I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for some of the more annoying 'guest hosts' that pop up from time to time to throw a speed bump in the way. Thankfully their segments only last a few seconds but a few less of them would have helped keep the frenetic pace up. Jaded horror trailer fans who think they've seen it all will probably see a few obscure gems and those unfamiliar with the wild excesses and bombastic approach of retro horror trailers will find a treasure trove of fun in this fine collection.",1350864000,10,2444,4.802850356294536
