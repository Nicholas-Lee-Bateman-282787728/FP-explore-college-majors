8302516,3,B001FRS87O,"I love Nobuyuki Anzai. He gave me Flame of Recca and Marchen Awakens Romance (the latter still holds my favorite series of all time). Alas, the anime for Flame of Recca is inferior to what the manga offers. I'll list many of the reasons why the anime got the score it did.

First of is the plot. Recca Hanabishi is a teenager with the ability to wield fire but doesn't know why or how to control it and only uses it for minor things. He's obsessed with becoming the number one ninja (sounds familiar) and he decides to become someone's ninja if they can defeat him in battle thus resulting in people like his rival Domon and childhood friend Fuuko to attack him often. It was another day and he meets a beautiful girl name Yanagi who he saves (the method he saves her is different in the anime than the manga which adds some fridge logic as a result). She shows off her healing powers and heals his injuries saving his life and Recca pledges loyalty to her. He taps into his powers for real when a mysterious woman named Kagehoshi comes into his life and attempts to murder them. As Recca tries to harness the power of his flames, there are other villains interested in Yanagi's powers and attempt to kidnap her for them.

The anime only goes up to HALF of the manga. That's the major issue of the anime. If the anime was going to start, it might as well keep going because there is a game based on the last portion of the manga that never came to the west. As a result, the end of the series is obviously rushed to the point that you wonder if any effort was put into it. My biggest issue is Joker being demoted to extra. He's just...there. The awesome fight he has with Kaoru and Kaoru's motivation to fight him doesn't make sense at all. He surrenders for no reason and just leaves. Since Joker is a fan favorite, this is a huge NO!

The series also leaves out a lot of the comedy aspects out to go straight to the next match. This is jarring as Anzai is known for throwing comedy in his fights no matter how serious or dark the battle gets. It saddens me when Domon isn't making a joke during battle and he does the funniest things in battle.

The plot also falls short because of the anime failing to explain important plot points at the end. You don't see Recca's process in getting the fire dragons and the final battles are sped up. Kaoru's motivation for joining Kurei is noticeably changed. He went from suicidal teen in the manga to just being approached one day by Kurei because of his intelligence which seems to take his inner struggle away during this important scene. It goes into hidden depths territory after all. Kaoru's character as a whole is never tapped in and he's just seen as the little brat that joins the group because he has a crush on Yanagi.

Fortunately, Tokiya is left untouched in the anime (given how the manga loves to make fun of him later). Poor Yanagi has it worse though in the anime being a full distressed damsel whose only role is to get captured unlike the manga where she does more things than that.

Without bringing up the ending, these are the major changes that anime has, but other than that, the anime is faithful to the manga up until the last two rounds. There is a lot of action in the anime (but not a lot of character development given the character development really starts after the tournament arc) which is the point of the series. The concept of the weapons is why I like Anzai's creations so much because it shows that he does research and give details to each weapon (and he does this even better in Marchen Awakens Romance). Overall though, the anime is a pass. I prefer the JP voices over the EN given I feel like some of the voices don't match up at all.",1363996800,,3720,4.345323741007194
8302517,5,B001FRS87O,"This was a great old school anime to the end. The ending wasn't as bad as a lot of anime do have horrible ending, but it did give more of a closure. This is a must have classic",1294099200,,176,3.6578947368421053
8302518,5,B001FRS87O,"This is a very enjoyable anime series, and this seller sold it for a good price and it was delivered to me quickly. My order arrived in perfectly brand new, sealed condition, as stated by the seller. I would buy from this seller again.",1264464000,,235,4.363636363636363
8302519,4,B001FRS87O,"Recca Hanabishi is a massive ninjaphile -- which isn't surprising, since he seems to be from a past era himself.

Based on Kentaro Yabuki's longrunning manga ""Flame of Recca,"" this solid little anime series is a heady little shonen story, with countless fiery duels and strange ninja artifacts. The storyline and writing are pretty well done, although the second half is overshadowed by a constant string of one-on-one fights.

Recca is badly hurt rescuing his sweet-natured classmate Yanagi -- only to be miraculously healed when his ""princess"" touches him. Impressed by her kindness and special power, Recca pledges to be her personal ninja.

But then a shadowy woman named Kagehoshi appears, and attacks them both in an effort to make Recca show his ""fire"" -- and when she tries to kill Yanagi, flames appear on Recca's hand. She further enrages Recca by manipulating his classmates -- tomboyish Fuko and icy swordsman Tokiya -- into attacking him with their ninja ""madogus,"" but then a mysterious pair of thugs kidnap Yanagi.

To get her back, Recca, Fuko, Tokiya and lug-with-a-heart-of-gold must infiltrate a vast mansion and fight an escalating string of madogu bearers. Unfortunately the most deadly is Kurei, a masked man who reveals a secret connection to Recca. And after that, as the group begins training to become stronger, Kurei invites them to the Underground Death Tournament.

There, the four teenagers must triumph in the tournament to keep Yanagi from going to Kurei. They're forced to fight a series of other teams whose madogus control paper, hair, flesh, size, a beast-man, plant matter, sound, and many other things. Even worse, most of the teams are on Kurei's payroll. But Recca and his friends refuse to be beat -- and Recca's right arm holds an ever-expanding power that may give him victory...

The biggest problem with ""Flame of Recca"" is that it starts chugging along nicely for the plot-heavy first third, slows down somewhat into the Death Tournament's sequential fights, and then.... stops. It doesn't even come close to finishing Kentaro Yabuki's storyline, and it doesn't really get a conclusion of its own. It just stops.

But it's a fun ride up until then -- loads of action involving increasingly sinister madogus, and some fire duels with very unexpected combatants. Even in the less violent episodes, we get glimpses of terrible things like Tokiya's tragic, bloody past, or the ghastly fate of the Hokage ninja. And the last two thirds are a string of dramatic fights between various teams, with plenty of flashy ninja magic and the occasional dirty trick (such as a trap door leading to a drowning pit) by Kurei's loyal goons.

Fortunately things are somewhat lightened by But it's worth noting that the animation is not that great -- hair and faces often shift and grow, and some of the hand-to-hand fights are awkward. And the voice actors range from brilliant (Domon, Tokiya) to nails-on-chalkboard annoying (Kaoru Koganei).

What keeps this interesting is Recca himself -- he's a likable kid with a big heart and a short fuse, who learns greater wisdom as he starts unlocking his new fire powers. Yanagi is a suitably sweet love interestung, but feisty Fuko and the big-ugly-punk-with-a-heart-of-gold Doman are nice counterpoints to Recca. And haughty, beautiful Tokiya is Recca's complete opposite in every way, but his tragic past and fondness for Yanagi keep him from being too unlikeable.

And since every series needs a Big Bad Guy, we have a crazy-eyed megamogul and the slightly insane, masked Kurei (""This is getting kinda fun,"" he chuckles as Recca sets of fireworks). Most of his goons aren't very likable, but a few are such as the chirrupy boy-warrior Kaoru, or the melancholy ninja Raiha.

Though the plot grinds to a halt in favor of one-on-one fights, ""Flame of Recca"" is a solid action anime with some surprising twists. Definitely worth seeing.",1235520000,2,3907,5.03250773993808
