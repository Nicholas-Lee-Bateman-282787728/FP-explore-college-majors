3783105,5,B001S0BMQC,I would definitely recommend this series for anyone desiring to learn more about the Word of God.  Jeff has the ability to relay the message in a manner that is easily understood by any layperson.  And a great feature of this set is that it is a premier learning tool not only for bible groups but also for individual study.  Definitely worth the expense.,1366416000,5,355,4.515625
3783106,5,B001S0BMQC,"This is in the tradition of the early church fathers with a catholic slant. It recognizes the bible studies of the 20th century but does not go to them. It focus on where we have come from, where we are, and where we are going. OUR STORY
This is an excellent listen. Jeff Cavins cannot tell a joke but his material is excellently organized and will speak to how God is acting in your daily life. Also, you will read a lot of the bible.",1366329600,,435,4.129411764705883
3783107,5,B001S0BMQC,"Jeff Cavins has made studying the Bible enjoyable by unlocking the first step:  the Bible is not written in chronological order, but there is a definite storyline.  Once the Bible is studied with this one simple idea exposed, the treasures of the Biblical message come pouring forth!  Thanks for a well-done Bible study that leaves the participant anxiously awaiting the next ""gem"" of Biblical discovery!",1361059200,3,404,5.184615384615385
3783108,5,B001S0BMQC,"I encourage believers and non believers to purchase the Bible Timeline. It will take you on an interesting trip to the knowledge of God, the God we love and many times do not know. Jeff Cavins obviously has been gifted to do such a wonderful work.
The best part is that he tells the story in a non boring style, it keeps you wanting to get to the next session, and doing it in a group adds to the benefits. I am loving it!!!!!",1358899200,,426,4.083333333333333
3783109,5,B001S0BMQC,"This is a wonderful presentation of the complete story of Salvation History!  Jeff Cavins is very knowledgeable of the bible and how the story is all pointed to the coming of Jesus.
Cavins selects 17 books of the Hebrew Scriptures that explains the entire story beginning in Genesis and ending with the Acts of Apostles. A study worthy of any serious biblical scholarship.",1352419200,2,372,4.904761904761905

3783111,5,B001S0BMQC,"This set of lectures helps the student place the books of the Bible into an historical context using those books which create a chronological order to use as a framework for gaining greater insight for all Christians as well as gives an organizational character for non-believers seeking the truth.
Terrific educational guide for those with little or none academic knowledge of the Bible!",1275264000,15,388,5.174603174603175

8339293,5,B001S0BMQC,"I have been through this at least 9 times in the past 2 years.  My groups only use the DVD's and then have discussion questions that apply to changing our lives!  The binder makes it too academic, time consuming and boring.  People were quitting when we followed Jeff's suggested academic format.  No one has quit when we got rid of the binder.  They all loved it.",1398556800,6,364,4.454545454545454

8339295,5,B001S0BMQC,"This was my first bible study. Going through life understanding very little on the Old Testament I was so excited to learn more. Jeff Cavins makes it understandable, interesting, educational. I don't know how many times I got chills down my spine at some of the amazing things he pointed out. If the OT has always been sort of a mystery to you, this study helps clear it up. We had a class at our church hall for this and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. We are on Matthew now (also a Jeff Cavins study) and it is just as good. We hope to get through everything he has to offer.",1391904000,3,577,4.254545454545455
