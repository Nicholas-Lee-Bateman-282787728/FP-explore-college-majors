1340657,5,B00004FR5X,"Beautifully filmed documentary on America's top cloth doll artists.  It is thrilling to see the various artists in their studio's and hear their stories about how they started making dolls.  A must for any doll  collector, lover, maker.",952905600,22,236,5.157894736842105
1340658,5,B00004FR5X,This is a fantastic video for doll makers and designers and anyone else who is interested in dolls. It is very sad in places and filled with great joy in  others and shows how being creative can help women in many ways. To  see elinor peace bailey is a visual delight in itself. The other artists are  also amazing. I loved this video and watched it over and over again....you  will get so much from it...it is an inspiration to me and I can't recommend  it highly enough!,952905600,30,472,4.318181818181818
1340659,5,B00004FR5X,"The Art of the Doll Maker is not only a compelling explanation of why doll makers do what they do, but it is also a visual feast of the work of a variety of talented doll artists.  Have a box of tissues handy when you  watch this one.  It's an emotionally powerful documentary.",952905600,4,277,4.188679245283019
7920325,4,B00004FR5X,"This is very much a video primarily of interest to dollmakers, but probably not interesting to anyone else. The video will not show you how to make a doll, but it has interviews with different dollmakers as they explain why they make dolls. Not for everyone.",1464566400,,258,4.630434782608695
7920326,5,B00004FR5X,"That title may seem to some a hyperbole, but I can say with all sincerity that this movie has had an unimaginable impact on my life, and there is simply no way I could have grown into the person I am today without it.  We were lucky enough to discover it in high school and that is really when the blessings started tricklin' on down!

Firstly, we made our own ""Personal Motivational Sisters"" for when times get tough and we feel those power surges.  Second, this will really help you understand that Dollmaking is the most vulnerable of all arts, and completely expresses yourself.  The reviews that complain ""too much therapy"" are written by HACKS as nowhere did the tears more readily flow than in those intimate moments.  Elinor Peace Bailey is an inspiration and my fears that all other humans would be a disappointment after seeing her led me to friend her on facebook.  Three years later, she accepted and finally I was able to feel validation.

I literally cannot recommend this film highly enough.",1363219200,,1006,4.681818181818182
7920327,5,B00004FR5X,"As a doll artist myself ""ugly art dolls"" I absolutely LOVED this film. It shows the depth of feeling that goes into art dolls. And how allot of artist use it to work through grief ect.",1306195200,,184,4.138888888888889
7920328,3,B00004FR5X,"An interesting dvd which does show dolls and the incredible artists who create them. However, I too agree that the title is misleading; this is more about the doll makers and how a lot of them in this documentary, use doll making as therapy to get over the death of their loved ones.
While it makes for an interesting story, it also detracts.
The works of Lisa Lichtenfels and E.J. Taylor is worth the price of the dvd alone.",1233619200,3,425,4.3924050632911396
7920329,5,B00004FR5X,"I loved this DVD!  It is full of different dollmakers, with different styles, and all were articulate and fun.  It is so inspiring to meet other doll makers and hear thier thoughts on their art and creations. It was inspiring to me to expand my boundries on dolls I make.  If you are interested in doll making, and want to ""meet' some really cool dollmakers, this DVD is for you.",1224806400,,379,4.385714285714286
7920330,5,B00004FR5X,"I bought this because I am interested in the art of dollmaking, particularly art dolls. After all it is titled ""The Art of the Dollmaker."" This is not about art, or art dolls, but it is about doll makers, and I would say, doll making as therapy. It was pretty interesting, and held my attention, and I didn't feel cheated. So, a misleading title, but I got my nickel's worth.",1223337600,2,375,4.371428571428571
7920331,3,B00004FR5X,"Though there are dolls artists interviewed in this documentary, they are people who are useing doll making to cope with their personal loss and stress.  Therapy seemingly was the main theme here and so I found the title very miss-leading.  If the director wanted to make a film involving ""coping skills"" and hobbies for therapy he'd have been better off talking to a group of knitters, quilters and crossword puzzlers.
The ""Art of the Doll"" is a very misleading title.  One rents or buys this particular title to know more about the actual process and techniques of ""Doll Art"" but instead is treated to personal angst.  There are some nice interviews with famous doll artists and an array of wonderful photos of their work with saves the film somewhat.",1221782400,6,752,4.8062015503875966
7920332,5,B00004FR5X,"This is one of the most inspirational DVD's I have ever seen. I, too, am a ""dollmaker"" and have watched this DVD 3 times now. All I can say is ""WOW.""

7920333,5,B00004FR5X,"This documentary is a peek into the world of some of the our most billiant doll artists. It is a look at the personal side to their dollmaking, what got them started, the processes they go through while creating a doll, etc. I recommend this dvd for any dollmaker.",1094601600,13,264,4.408163265306122
7920334,5,B00004FR5X,"This movie is a must have for any doll maker or none doll maker.  Giving inspiration to help you create.  You'll meet many known doll artists and view many great dolls, created from many different mediums.  It helps you  to understand how creating something from deep within can be very healing.",952992000,25,295,4.7254901960784315
