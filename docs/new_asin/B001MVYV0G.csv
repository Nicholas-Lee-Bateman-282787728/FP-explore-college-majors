The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill.",1377734400,3,1631,4.726315789473684
3702343,5,B001MVYV0G,"I knew the British were crazy about Hndel and Doctor Who, so, no wonder a project that joined Hndel and BBC would be wonderful in every detail!

They assembled a team of experts to try to recreate the night the Water Music was first played in every single detail, and their research was exceptional and well explained throughout: political and historical context, motivations for such a flamboyant spectacle, 18th century-looking boat (complete with ornaments), candlelights, costumes and, of course, period instruments.
Speaking of which, the English Concert does an excellent interpretation. Melodies, counterpoint, individual instruments and the bass are all perfectly clear and the result is wonderful, as if they were playing in a regular, comfy concert hall. It is even more stunning considering the hindrances they underwent: handwritten scores, candlelight, wind, boat movement, wigs...

The whole team's final result is a great success.

Unfortunately, as the other reviewer stated, they do not play the complete Water Music. However, I don't think that justifies 4 stars, since I think the purpose was always to produce a documentary about Water Music, with parts of the music are played as a big bonus.

To sum it up: Fantastic!",1370044800,3,1239,5.3061224489795915
3702344,5,B001MVYV0G,"Handel's Water Music: Recreating a Royal Spectacular / Andrew Manze is a recording the recreates the premiere of Handels Water Music. This entailed having the right clothes, the right boat on which to play and so many other details. The work put into this event is quite staggering but being a BBC production anything else would be a dissapointment knowing the reputation that comes from it being produced by such a reknowned media company. The booklet is a work of art with fine drawings and very well-written music notes by Donald Burrows. Highly recommended. 5/5.",1302912000,6,566,4.968421052631579
3702345,4,B001MVYV0G,"While I was disappointed that they didn't perform the entire Water Music, the movements that are performed are played exceptionally well: excellent musicians and period-style performance, exceptional DTS surround sound, and very visually engaging (they took great pains to re-create every aspect of the original performance of the Water Music, including full period dress and a fully-outfitted 18th century style boat that they play on while floating down the river). Highly recommended. (I would have given this 5 stars if they played the entire Water Music, but I think they were limited on time due to this originally being a BBC broadcast program).",1248566400,14,652,5.339805825242719

8322247,5,B001MVYV0G,"Has it really been 32 years since the 'Handel tricentennial', February 23, 1985?  Seems like only a few years ago!  Well, today is also a notable tricentennial, that of the premiere of the Water Music on the Thames River in London, July 17, 1717!

It brings to mind that what made Handel famous is not his being 'born'.  He had very little if any control over that!  Rather, it's what his accomplishments in life were.  So, possibly, the celebrations are backwards??

One should be aware the default track of this DVD is an hour-long documentary detailing the modern recreation of the concert on the Thames.  It contains only snippets of music.  The concert section is accessed only on the 'Extras' menu, and apparently some customers are missing that.  It's a poor design feature and the only criticism I have of this DVD.

With that minor caveat, it is very highly recommended :)",1500249600,,881,4.730263157894737

8322254,5,B001MVYV0G,The music is wonderful. The Water Music boat parade was a special event in Classical Music. The discussions of why they held the event and the effort it took to make the original boat parade were entertaining and fun. The DVD will be watched again with family and friends.,1420070400,2,272,4.571428571428571
