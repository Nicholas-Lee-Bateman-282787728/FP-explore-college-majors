5710383,4,B00CAYSGXC,"Jimmy and Brian are a good combination always. I guess it's still fascinating to watch Brian in an informal role. He's Ed McMahon to Johnny Carson here. Entertaining, but a bit of a slow start.",1389398400,,193,4.542857142857143

5710388,5,B00CAYSGXC,Great to get an understanding of the early plans Jimmy had for the show and comparing them to how the show has evolved. Jimmy has a real sense of fun and imparts it into the show. If I didn't know better I would say he was Canadian!,1366156800,3,232,3.9574468085106385

5710399,5,B00CAYSGXC,"Could not ask for more ... but, of course, I do!

I wish for more videos of Jimmy Fallon to be available via Prime Video.

I wish for lots more people on Amazon to find this video; not quite 40 reviews as I write this.

I wish for more humor that I haven't discovered yet.",1442102400,,272,3.909090909090909
5710400,4,B00CAYSGXC,Brian Williams takes the spotlight in this interview. He's got a great sense of dry humor!!,1441929600,,91,4.75

5710402,5,B00CAYSGXC,Awesome!! Was greatly entertaining as usually with Jimmy Fallon.,1439856000,,64,6.222222222222222
5710403,5,B00CAYSGXC,Jimmy Fallon is amazing - he is the perfect entertainer and is self-deprecating to the right amount with a touch of silliness and awareness that is clearly instinctual with him.  I truly consider him to be a comedic genius - of course one who surrounds himself with amazing writers and an innate passion for what he does.  I can't say enough about him.,1438214400,,352,4.571428571428571

5710407,5,B00CAYSGXC,Pretty interesting interview especially now he is the host of the tonight show.,1429488000,,79,5.153846153846154
5710408,5,B00CAYSGXC,I love Jimmy Fallon.,1427932800,,20,4.25
5710409,5,B00CAYSGXC,"Fallon and Williams. Always a top notch funny duo. This was, of course, before the Tonight Show gig and gives some insight into Fallon's dreams and early background. He's goofy from the start. I've watched this maybe six times and laughed every time. (And I think Williams should take over The Daily Show...)",1427328000,,308,4.830188679245283
5710410,5,B00CAYSGXC,Laugh out loud! What a great combo.,1425945600,,35,4.142857142857143
5710411,5,B00CAYSGXC,Love Jimmy Fallon and Brian Williamss; they are comical together.,1424390400,,65,5.6
5710412,5,B00CAYSGXC,"Amazing. Jimmy Fallon is incredible and has a personality that makes you want to just sit down and have a cup of coffee and hang out with him. This is the atmosphere he has created in the Tonight Show. His humble and warm personality along with his wit and incredible sense of humor overflow in this interview. Brian Williams plays straight man like no other to Fallon.
Every time I have seen Fallon open up and show more of who he is I am more and more intrigued by him. Well done Paley Center! I would love to see another current interview of Jimmy since the takeover of the Tonight Show!",1421625600,,590,4.324324324324325
5710413,5,B00CAYSGXC,"Jimmy has such a likable persona & a fun chemistry with Brian. The whole interview was excellent, he even took that troll of a question at the end in stride. If you liked this, check out his episode on Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, you'll enjoy it.",1420761600,,269,4.510204081632653
5710414,3,B00CAYSGXC,Lost interest. Sort of OK but not compelling.,1419897600,,45,4.75
5710415,5,B00CAYSGXC,Good interview. He is down to earth and relatable.,1419292800,,50,4.666666666666667

5710417,5,B00CAYSGXC,"Funny interview, Jimmy is hilarious!!!",1417564800,,38,6.8
5710418,5,B00CAYSGXC,"Though the interview is slightly more than an hour long, there is so much dialogue packed into it that I felt like I saw a longer interview. This is a good take on Jimmy Fallon - how genuine he is and pardon the pun, how rooted he is.  Roots from family and roots from Roots.  What more could anyone need.  But the bottom line is, give that man just a pencil and piece of paper and no doubt, he will not only use it to write scripts, but make paper airplanes, other origamy, maybe a hat or a puppet, a mask, and so on.  Jimmy's talents were in his genes.  His family brought out his best by letting him do what he wanted to do.  The interview makes you understand that through all the very funny talk he shares about his life as a standup comic - mortal, on his mononuclear monkeypad, monopolizing the monologue while monitoring his fellow monosomies.  What more could an entertainer in funny business enrobe themselves with?  (ha!)",1413158400,3,932,4.377906976744186
5710419,5,B00CAYSGXC,Outstanding.  Fallon's energy is contagious.  Funniest man in America. Second in the world only to the Queen of England.,1411171200,,120,5.2631578947368425
5710420,1,B00CAYSGXC,"No. A nervy, fidgety smirk accompanied by an over-enjoyment of your own jokes is not technically ""funny."" About the only upside I can see with his career is that he his energetic. However, rather than putting said energy into maybe subtlety (or a different approach), he overdoes damn near every joke or worse yet, laughs at his own stuff?

Getting movie and show deals means you have a terrific agent, or you saved some hollywood insider's life. But this guy SUCKS at comedy.",1410912000,,476,4.734939759036145
