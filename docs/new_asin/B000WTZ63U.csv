8225695,1,B000WTZ63U,"Not subtitled, dialog mushy, waste of money for deaf or hearing impaired.  If Amazon included subtitling status in all their DVD descriptions, they would sell more, and there would be fewer one star reviews from ""minorities"" like me.  For those of you with normal hearing who consider this review a distraction ... keep listening to loud music with earbuds, you will appreciate this review when you are older.",1506124800,,409,5.0

8225697,2,B000WTZ63U,"Yes, Hugh was great acting the part, but the movie was depressing, and I just could not finish watching him go further down, into the downward spiral, his character was going!",1373328000,,175,4.67741935483871
8225698,5,B000WTZ63U,This DVD is a must for all Hugh Laurie fans. He does such a wonderful job of developing the character and seeing him as this rather sad troubled character demonstrates will how talented he is.,1359676800,,192,4.514285714285714
8225699,5,B000WTZ63U,"A very dramatic, watchable drama, where you want to root for Leo(Hugh Laurie), even though his gambling is troublesome. Hugh is really believable as a gambler who only wants to make everyone happy. Actually felt sorry for him. Good acting, and I thought the ending was perfect.",1315008000,,277,4.914893617021277
8225700,2,B000WTZ63U,"This movie was too painful to even watch to its conclusion.  I really enjoy Hugh Laurie, and his acting was quite good in this movie. The character he played was on such a downward spiral through an addiction that it was utterly unenjoyable.  I couldn't see past this very pitiful character and very sad story.  Perhaps I'm into escapism when I watch a movie.  Sad stories are one thing, but watching an addict spiral downward is just annoying.",1294876800,,444,4.653846153846154
8225701,5,B000WTZ63U,"Hugh Laurie at the top of his game in a morality tale that remains more current than ever in light of the Madoff, etc. schemes. Must see. Slow start... hang in there!",1261958400,,166,4.21875
8225702,3,B000WTZ63U,"While Hugh Laurie does an adequate job of acting this film doesn't quite deliver. The writing is weak and isn't strengthened by the addition of explicit love scenes which, in addition to being simply embarrassing, have an aura of silliness about them like a tacky film from the 70s. Overall the film plays like a low budget film, which, except for the inclusion of Laurie, I suppose it is.

The ending is particularly hard to watch with an unintentionally funny, supposedly ironic ending.

Pass on this one unless you are a hard core Laurie fan.",1231372800,26,545,4.726315789473684
8225703,5,B000WTZ63U,"This is an interesting drama about a man (Hugh Laurie) whose life is out of control, but in a hidden and quiet way.  His interactions with his wife, family and friends are all portrayed quite realistically.  I liked Hugh Laurie's acting in this, and recommend it highly.  I don't want to give away too many details, but think you will find it a fascinating story to watch.",1213920000,12,372,4.522388059701493
8225704,5,B000WTZ63U,"Another outstanding performance by Mr. Laurie.  He is an amazing actor that once again shows his enormous talent.

Mr. Laurie play a con artist named Leo who would sell his mother to make a buck.

There's a great scene of Mr. Laurie doing TAI-CHI in his underware is an added bonus!",1203552000,24,282,4.490196078431373
