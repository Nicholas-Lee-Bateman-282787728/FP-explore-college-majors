2653314,5,B000I5Y8LO,Guyver is the best anime I have seen in a long time! I wanted to get in some new anime and this one is it! You will not be dissapointed. If I had more thumbs I will definitely give it more! Get this! And at your own risk...you will love it!,1163721600,,240,3.7254901960784315
2653315,4,B000I5Y8LO,"OK OK OK...

Before I begin, I must say that I loved the old Guyver series so I may be a little bias in my review.  Guyver was the first anime that really turned me on to the genre and is still my favorite of all time.

The new Guyver is basically a revamp of the best qualities of the old series with a few exceptions.  Let me explain.  The animation is beautiful and all the old Guyver weapons are still there...but unfortunetly the old hookey, gee wiz teenage love story is still there as well.  It's not that I don't care for that angle of the story, it's just that I wish it was done differently.  Also, this version seemed less graphic than the original.

Something else I didn't like was the way Tetsuro and Sho acted after having 2 encounters with Cronos.  Some pretty reality crushing stuff happened yet they are calm and rational about it.  They kind of just go on with everyday life even though Sho just turned into a crazy super killing machine and destroyed insane monsters that came out of nowhere!!  You think they would freak out a little!

Also, being a fan of the old Guyver series, I really missed some of the classic characters voices.  Not that the new ones are bad, in fact they are pretty good.  But Commander Guyot should never NEVER change his voice.  I also miss Agito's old voice.

But there are positives to it as well.  Firstly, it's GUYVER! It's NEW!  It's finally going to tell the rest of the story!  Plus we get to see some new Zoanoids that we've never seen before. The fight scenes are intense and are we even get a few surprises (shooting the bullet out of the air was awesome!}  I don't want to ruin it, but there are a few rewind and watch again parts.

All my bitching aside, this is well worth a purchase and comes with a nice 32 page booklet with some good info in it.  It doesn't feel cheap at all, everything is very much of great quality.  Do yourself a favor and get this DVD.  I just wish they put more than 4 episodes on it!",1162684800,2,1971,4.250673854447439
2653316,5,B000I5Y8LO,"All right, well I do not have the DVD cause of course it's not out. But, I do however have the Japanese version. And I have seen all the episodes. If your a fan of the Guyver then you will want this DVD! I am sure most of you Guyver fans have seen the 12 part anime that was released in the 90's. I am sure a lot of you liked it a lot, and others thought it was descent. Well now the Guyver has a whole new look, and it will re-tell everything that happened in the 12 part and then some!

First off, this new Guyver series  came out in Japan in 2005 and it was on TV with 26 episodes! Guyver Vol. 1: Days of Future Past will have the first 4 episodes into the new series. When you first pop this into your DVD player you will be amazed! This Guyver series just kicks the crap out of everything you have ever seen in the past. The animation is just excellent and beautiful!

The first episodes starts off with an amazing way to start the new series. You first get a shot of a nice clear blue sky, with Mizuki talking'then when all of a sudden everything goes to hell. What you will see here may confuse you'.which is good! Means you do not know what's going to happen. If you have read a decent amount of the Mangas you will already know the story but its so worth it to watch. Mizuki will continue to talk, then all of a sudden this weird figure comes out of the sky and you see this figure with glowing eyes, then you see a control metal glow'.then here comes the intro.

This DVD will be a tease, You only get 4 episodes out of 26 and boy oh boy does it start to get really good. From the episodes you will watch will not even compare what will happen in the next volumes! Episodes 1 will show you everything you need to know. If you don't know anything about the Guyver this will teach you a lot of stuff you will need to learn, and if you know the Guyver, some of the scenes you will see will look like something you have seen before cause that's well'you have in the past, but with better animation.

You will get introduce to most of the main characters in these 4 episodes. You will lean how Sho becomes the Guyver. A lot of the old Guyver fans will be shocked to see how Sho does not look like Sho in the 12 part. I actually like how Sho looks in the new series. About everyone you have seen in the 12 part, will look different, besides a few will look the same or close to the same. It gives this series a good breath of fresh air. The new look, and the story will be similar to the 12 part in some parts, but also will have a lot of other parts that was never in the 12 part. The new series fallows the Manga at it's best! And the story is just so detailed then from the 12 part and is more in-depth

I have seen all the episodes like I have said. And I have seen the first episode in English already. If you are a big Guyver fan, or just found out about the Guyver or you are looking for a new sci-fi anime then this is for you. You will not be disappointed! I recommend this DVD to anyone who has seen the Guyver before and loved it, to people who have seen the Guyver before and didn't care for it and also for new people that want to get into the Guyver. This series is Guyver at it's best and even people that didn't like the 12 part I really think will like this series!

English voices 4.5/5  - from what I have heard in the first episodes the English cast is pretty good, but I am just so used to the Japanese voices it just seems a little weird.

Animation 5/5 - The Animation in this Guyver series is just amazing which I have said before. This makes all the past Guyver animation look like crap.

Story 5/5 - The story for the new series is just amazing, it takes you though what happened in the 12 part, and them more. The story is more detailed and in-depth in this Guyver series then it ever was in the 12 part.

Fight scenes 5/5 The fight scene are just amazing that's all there is to say about it.

8144132,5,B000I5Y8LO,"Guyver is an anime adaptation of a 1980's manga and an early 1990's Mark Hamill movie. Sadly the movie was dumb. Imagine Mark Hamill as a power ranger. That's pretty much the size of it. The anime is a different story. I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.

I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored. It's not exactly one of the better anime titles out there, but it's still a lot of fun. I recommend giving it a try. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1353369600,,781,4.241610738255034
8144133,5,B000I5Y8LO,Robert`s Anime Corner Store did Great these guys are pro the DVD arrived a day early product was perfect and as expected. Great Job!,1321660800,,132,4.541666666666667
8144134,5,B000I5Y8LO,"This is volume one of a 7 volume series.  The first 5 volumes contain 4 episodes per volume, with 6 and 7 having 3 each for a total of 26 episodes in all.

If you are a sci-fi/anime fan, this series is a must see.  As with any series, it is best to start with episode 1 and stay in order.  The plot is pretty good, and there as some interesting twist, and character development is pretty good through the series.  There are some interesting technology proposed in this series and is pretty interesting to see how the writers explain it and how it affects society.

This reminds me of the Transformers, but instead of machines trans forming into humaniod robots, you have people transforming into bio-based machines or cybors of sorts.  It is called ""bio-boosting armor"", but the guyver units are more than just armor that augments human physical abilities, it has it's own artifical intelligence that allows the unit to learn from the battles, to make it more formiable the next battle.  There could be a hidden message warning about run-away scientific research, espeically genetic engineering and a ""Big Brother"" type of government.",1225065600,,1134,4.779487179487179
8144135,5,B000I5Y8LO,"I started collecting this when it first came out in 2006
and love it. I havent't seen the old anime show but hope to some it sometime. For now I will enjoy This one. I have bought the second volume with the collectors box and I am at Volume 6 and am ready
To get the 7 and final volume when it comes out. For those who
are interested this first volume includes Episodes 1-4 and
comes with a full page color art book!!!",1189468800,,418,3.988095238095238
8144136,1,B000I5Y8LO,"I bought this thinking that it would be a cool retelling of the story with improved artwork.
It's not,it's almost exactly the same, except it's worse! yes with the advancement in television and film since the original series was made they managed to remake this series worse than it was before!

buy the 12 episodes from the 90's much better.",1188950400,,342,4.7
8144137,5,B000I5Y8LO,"If you love the Guyver, then you have to buy this volume. It only has four episodes, but it also includes special features and a 32 page book that tells a lot about the Guyver universe with pictures as well. The animation is amazing and the story is very interesting. It may not be as bloody as the original Anime series, but it is still worth buying just for the in-depth story alone. The acting is superb, even in English dub, it is incredible acting. I can't wait to have all seven volumes in my DVD collection! Well worth the wait and a must have for sure.",1167004800,2,560,4.242990654205608
8144138,3,B000I5Y8LO,"If asked which 'R' best describes my feelings about this new series (pardon my reference to Kill Bill), I'd have to say it was a mix of both.

Relief that

  ... finally I can see what happened after the point where Viz Comics put the series on hiatus.

  ... the new series, with a few exceptions, follows the comic.

  ... I get to see the awesome Guyver Gigantus unleashed.

Regret that

  ... this series still isn't finished even after 26 episodes.

  ... the quality of the animation is sub-par in comparison to other series made about the same time.

  ... the story doesn't have the fast pacing of the earlier series.

  ... this version wastes a lot of time rehashing stuff you saw already (and taking more episodes to do it!)

Should you collect it?  If you have the original series, I'd wait until this series catches up to where the previous series left off.  If you don't, despite it's flaws, it isn't a bad series to add to your collection.",1166054400,4,954,4.432748538011696
8144139,1,B000I5Y8LO,"When I first watched this remake of the guyver, one word came to mind: Lame. It's not near as action packed as the original dubbed version. The only good thing in my opinion was the lengthened fighting scenes and extra story line, but there was almost too much talking. I think they should finish making the old one and forget about this one. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, expecially if your a big fan of the old one.",1164844800,,422,4.3544303797468356
