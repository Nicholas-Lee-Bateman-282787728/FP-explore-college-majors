7803359,5,6300152936,I bought this because I remember it from my childhood but the movie is okay. I loved it more out of nostalgia than anything. Dark themes in the movie but I would still let kids watch it.,1432598400,,186,4.054054054054054
7803360,5,6300152936,"Remember in the 60s,70s and 80s when in primtime tv there were holiday animated specials that were hand drawn and stop motion puppet animated. Then you had the Chuck Jones animated 25 min. classics such as his versions of Kipling's THE WHITE SEAL, RIKKI TIKKI TAVI. And his versions of Dr. SEUSS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS and HORTON HEARS A WHO! FAERIES, the animated special based on Froud's and Alan Lee's book falls into this category. Most of the animaters names in the credits of this special are english names not Korean or Japanese so Tomarrow Entertainment was probably an american animation studio! Beautifully animated with detailed drawings and backrounds that bring a 25 min. adventure to animated life, this special is an example of an artform that has been dieing out in the United States. Specials like this one gave talented animaters the opportunity to show a family audience what they could do as opposed to the usual Saturday morning drival that was cranked out every week by the networks! The special takes the name of the young Oisin from the FAERIES book and made up it's own story of Oisin, a young boy who is chosen by the fairy princess, Niamh, daughter of the Faery King( voiced by Hans Conreid) who goes on a quest to stop the evil Shadow from taking over Faeryland and marrying Niamh! Kolbolds, pixies, Puck, witches, the Fachan, the Unseelie Court, Redcaps, the Fir Darrig etc. are all depicted in this special in full, hand drawn animation! After paying $50.00 plus shipping and handling for this vhs, I 'm glad I copied it to DVD-RAM, NOT to make any money off of it, but to PRESERVE it for my private collection since DVD does not wear out! I love that I can see the texture of the paper through the watercolour on the backrounds in this special! In this age of CGI I yearn for hand crafted specials like this one! And the voices by Conreid and Foray(Captain Hook, Snidley Whiplash and Rocky the Flying Squirral, Witch Hazal) bring back fond memories! So glad I got this!! This VHS tape has this video recorded at the SP speed. I felt that should be mentioned since Amazon does not say what the playback speed of the VHS videos available online are! I'm glad this video has SP picture quality!",1383264000,,2232,4.638888888888889
7803361,5,6300152936,"This is so thickly-packed and substantive that I think of it as a feature film, even though it's only 30 minutes.  Great animation, great bad guy.

I'm impressed at the writer's awareness of obscure creatures such as merrows; that's something I wouldn't have expected to be accessible so long before the information age.",1313798400,,320,5.018867924528302
7803362,5,6300152936,"I used to watch this movie a lot since I was a little kid.  And even though it's not a DVD, I can still watch this on a VHS player.  And when I can't watch it anymore, I'll put it in my treasure chest of treasured memories.",1283990400,,223,3.723404255319149
7803363,5,6300152936,"Faeries is a very short movie, not even half an hour, and is based on Brian Froud's book Faeries. The story is about a youth named Oisin who is out on a hunt with the men to bring in some game for his birthday feast, but they have been unlucky are just about to give up and go home empty-handed. Just as the men are lamenting at even bringing the boy, a deer runs by Oisin and his horse chases it off into the forest. The deer stops to graze in a ring of mushrooms and just as Oisin is about to shoot it, it turns into a lovely young woman who states that she is Princess Niamh of the faeries. The princess takes Oisin with her to fairyland because they are in trouble. The king was showing off his magical ability and made his shadow come alive, but over time the shadow grew more powerful and began sucking power out of the king. The shadow took over most of the faerie realm with it's darkness (which weakens the powers of the seelie court) and was going to go after the princess next. It is of course up to Oisin and his assigned companion Puck to go after the monster in it's castle and defeat it, bringing peace to faerie realm once again.
The movie was decently done. Even though it was a short film it felt like a feature-length film. The animation of the faeries was very Froud like, which was interesting to see applied in a cartoon and was pretty accurate in regards to some creatures. Certain poses of some of the faeries looked like they came right out of the book. There were some cheesy lines and a few easy way outs that will have you rolling your eyes, but hey, it's the 80's. Overall worth while.",1279152000,2,1614,4.209677419354839
7803364,5,6300152936,"I LOVE this special. It has such wonderful charactors and the creators follow Froud's design to the letter. Nice dramatic simple plot too enough to keep you hanging on. The evil shadow reminds me of Henson's charactor the Skesis from the Dark Crystal. No wonder since Froud helped design it.

If you want a DVD of this old classic (Froud's 1981 Faeires not the 99 version)

7803365,5,6300152936,"I too was surprised to find it was only approximately a half hour long. It always seemed so much longer when I was kid. I grew up with this movie but my mom misplaced her copy for at least 10 years, so it had been a really long time since I saw it. My sis found it going through some boxes. She popped it in and when I heard the music in the other room, I immediately recognized it and decided the dishes could wait. :D It wasn't as scary as I remember and definitely not as long but it's still just as cool as I remembered. I wish it wasn't so rare. I would love to add it to my own collection. Watching it again brought back a lot of memories and it was fun introducing my own little ones to magic of Faeries.",1153872000,5,711,3.910344827586207
7803366,4,6300152936,"I had the good fortune of stumbling across a copy of this in a video store ""used"" bin. I snapped it up (for $6) and watched it immediatly upon getting home. I, like the other reviewer, was surprised to find it was only a half hour long, but was thrilled to find it was still as creepy as I remembered it. It scared the poop out of me as a kid, and it was a ball to watch as an adult.
If you happen to come across a copy of this flick, buy it -- you'll be happy you did.",1079481600,5,469,3.7
7803367,5,6300152936,"This listing pertains to the 1981 cartoon based on Brian Froud's 1978 book of the same name. Unfortunately, the seller from whom I purchased a copy was apparently not aware of this and sent me a copy of the unrelated 1999 cartoon, which has its own listing. Contact the seller before purchase to ascertain which one you're getting.
The 1981 cartoon is utterly wonderful. It was one of my favorites growing up, and thus my copy is dying. The plot is a simple good vs. evil, light vs. dark sort of thing. It's about half an hour long (which came as a surprise the first time I watched it as an adult) and isn't annoying.",1055548800,13,618,4.3826086956521735
