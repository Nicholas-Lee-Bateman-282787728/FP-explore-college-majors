7800782,5,1847970109,"The two DVD set ""Life Drawing Techniques In Action"" by Bridget Woods demonstrates short drawing exercises (typically 5 to 20 minutes) that gently introduce students to aspects of realistic drawing and the traditional art studio environment.  The drawings are impressionistic, but the lessons about realistic drawing are driven home.

The drawing of the female nude shown on the front cover of the DVD case is done in one exercise, but it is not a typical drawing.  (Calling the other drawings ""impressionistic""  may not be the precise term from the point of view of art history, but if publishers of non-fiction media can use misleading packaging, reviewers must also be given some slack.  The other drawings are ""sketchy"", ""gestural"" - you get the idea.  Furthermore, the drawing on the front cover is done in chalk and Conte crayon while most other exercises on the DVD are done in charcoal. )  Currently you can find video excerpts  on the Crowood Press website that show typical drawings or your could try using a magnifying glass on the back of the DVD case.

The exercises involve sketching nude models.  Footage includes shots of the models taken from the artist's point of view, so a student might use stop-motion to try the exercises for himself.  Although Nudity is present in almost every exercise,  it not an essential element of the course.  There is no detailed discussion of anatomy and  no technical anatomical terms are used.  There is no instruction about drawing the muscles of the body or hand or feet etc.  It seems to me that instructors could teach this material using models that wore light colored tights  Sometimes Bridget Woods remarks that she is using the belly button or a nipple is a landmark.  Perhaps a teacher could indicate anatomical landmarks on a clothed model with tape.

Bridget Woods speaks with a British accent.  Her presentation is clear and organized.  It's polished enough to be from a script, but natural enough that it might be spontaneous.  It's the ideal type of narration.  The video shows her drawings, the model, and sometimes a projection of the image of the model on the drawing.

These DVDs are an excellent introduction to the traditional studio environment.  Many prospective art students are comfortable sitting at a desk, drawing on copier paper or on the back of store receipts with a pencil, and consulting a photograph for their subject.  Although they feel that they ""know how to draw"", their enrollment in a studio class is disorienting.  Instead of the desk, there is the vertical easel.  Instead of a PostIt note, there is a huge sheet of drawing paper.  The familiar pencil is gone and replaced by a burnt stick of wood.  They must try a new way of holding it.  The person to be drawn is all the way across the room.  (Whether that person happens to be nude or not isn't the major novelty in the situation.)

The lessons on these DVDs give students a comfortable introduction, one that is simple, but not ""too easy"" or insubstantial.  The DVDs are only an introduction.  They don't take students to the level of detailed figure drawings.

Reserved and analytical people might be slightly uncomfortable at some moments in the course since Bridget Woods tries to communicate that drawing should be an enjoyable experience, like a mild form of dancing.  Such people are used to being slightly uncomfortable in social situations, so they can take it.

I rate this DVD set as five stars out of five to indicate that it is superior introduction to the studio environment and the methods of realistic drawing.

Synopsis

Disk One

Rhythim and Curve
Use the ""muscle memory"" in your arm to draw curves implied by the model.  This is a practical way to solve the problem of locating your drawing so the entire pose fits on your paper.

Measuring And Angle Finding
This is a practical demonstration of how to measure distances and angles with a pencil.  There are valuable practical hints such as:  Don't measure first. Draw first and then check by measuring.  Stand back from your drawing when you check measurements on it.  The most outstanding feature of how this material is taught is that we see Bridget Woods doing measurements in many of the subsequent exercises.  She does not make elaborate measurements.  She emphasis is that a drawing should begin by getting the big things correct.  Even though a drawing is sketchy, some proportions of the figure should be checked.

Negative Shapes
Draw the outline of a reclining model lying on a rectangular mat in a severely foreshortened pose by using the ""negative shapes"" formed by the models body and the edges of the mat.

Zig-zagging
Draw sweeping curves between important points on the pose of the model.

Eye Trust
Place one hand on the edge of the paper and draw the model with the other hand without looking at your drawing.  Notice how you get an idea of the location of the drawing hand from your placement of the non-drawing hand.

Passionate Line
A demonstration of the varieties of line that can be drawn.  Draw the model using lines that express different parts of the pose - as opposed to using lines that indicate outlines.

Disk Two

Tone: a trip around the model
A discussion of ""tone"", i.e. lightness and darkness.  She gives valuable hints about how the mind tends to misjudge tone.  For example, the eye tends to interpret a highlight within a dark area as being as bright as a highlight in a lighter area, even if it isn't.

Mid tones
Shade the areas of the model that are less than 50% lit.  All these areas are to be drawn in roughly the same shade.

Find the Form
Put a roughly uniform coat of charcoal on the paper and then lift off areas to show the places on the model that are more brightly lit.

Black and white on medium
Sketch the model using white chalk and dark Conte Crayon on gray paper.  Begin by drawing a a series of light to dark squares on the edge of the paper that is used as a reference for the values in the drawing.",1271894400,9,5970,4.711798839458414

7800784,4,1847970109,"I liked Ms Woods book on life drawing (which I bought through Amazon) so when I saw a DVD also listed, I was interested. Amazon listed it out of stock, but I managed to find a copy. I am amazed to see months later that you still show it out of stock. It is an excellent DVD. I particularly liked the way Ms Woods demonstrated each technique on paper rather than describing it, all the time showing the model, and at times even superimposing her drawing over the model to make a point. I found many of her 'lessons' helpful and would think many Amazon clients would agree. Incidentally, her book that piqued my interest was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Drawing-A-Journey-to-Self-Expression/dp/1861265980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Drawing: A Journey to Self-Expression</a>",1237334400,4,827,5.67741935483871
