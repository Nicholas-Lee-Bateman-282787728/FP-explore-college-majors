The story was not that bad, some of the actors were a little weak, but at least the main character, ""Mary Proud"" Kirsten, was strong....she was confident and focused. I loved her music a lot.....especially the opening song, that caught my attention. I wish them all well in their next project. I'm sure the next ones will be much better with more money behind it. But this was a good effort....keep up the good work!!!",1188086400,3,520,4.591397849462366
8138495,3,B000HC2OAU,"I did not enjoy this movie.  I think it was cheaply made.  The movie makers need to add professional actors to authenicate the movies.  I give this movie a 3 star, because of the efforts that was made, but not the quality of the movie.",1179446400,3,235,4.177777777777778
