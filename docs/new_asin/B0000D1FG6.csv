1921715,4,B0000D1FG6,"This is a movie that turns out better than the sum of its parts. The acting is wooden but Arch is pretty good. It's unpredictable in several places and overall I liked it - except for the painful warbling ""Ballad Of Billy"". Where are the music rights clearance nazis when you really need them?
This movie does cry out for a decent widescreen release.",1342224000,,350,4.484375
1921716,3,B0000D1FG6,"Having seen the choppers once and eegah more then a couple times (watch out for snakes!!),I purchased this movie. It sort of drags it feet for about half the movie before it starts picking up. Its not the greatest movie and I have seen worse (Manos:The hands of fate anyone). At times the performances seem a bit wooden and the line deliverances funny. It might be worth a rental.",1211241600,2,380,4.521739130434782
1921717,3,B0000D1FG6,"Maybe ""Deadwood '76"" isn't on par with a John Ford production, but I thought it was pretty good. The story is a cut above your run of the mill horse opera, and Arch does a decent job portraying Billy May, a cowboy who gets sucked into the gunfighter lifestyle reluctantly. The side stories involving his father's relationship with a soon to be hostile band of Sioux Indians was also pretty different and effective. Don't go into this one expecting ""Eegah!"" type laughs, or ""Sadist"" like chills, but give it a shot if you enjoy westerns. If I'm not mistaken this was the last film Arch made before leaving Hollywood behind in favor of a career in aviation, so if you are an Arch Hall Jr. fan, then you owe it to yourself to own Arch's swan song.",1110153600,13,744,4.437956204379562
1921718,3,B0000D1FG6,"Here in the Los Angeles County area and Victorville area, there was a new popularity of Arch Hall Jr films thanks to the television stations KDOC 56 (38) in 2003 and later KHIZ 44 (14) for airing ""Macabre Theatre"".  EEGAH! (1963) is frequently shown (Starring Arch Hall (Sr.), Arch Hall Jr, Carolyn Brandt and Richard Kiel).
  Another film with Arch Hall Jr. is Deadwood '76 (1965).  Billy May (Arch Hall Jr.) is on his way to Deadwood.  He meets up with a man Tennessee (Jack Lester) who is taking the same journey.  Tennessee is in search for gold so he can start his own business, The Tennessee Mining Company.  In town, Billy is mistakenly called ""Billy the Kid"" by an impressionitive boy.  To make matters worse, he has got Wild Bill Hickok (Robert Dix) on his tail and some Indians to look out for.  Can he make it alive out of this town?
  This film is low-budget, but a good western story easy to follow.  The print of film that Alpha Video offers is not the finest, originally made for widescreen, but this version is standard with the borders of the picture frame cropped.  The picture is slightly squeezed in, but watchable like an Italian western film.  Filmed in South Dakota.  Devil's Tower can be seen.
  If you have become a fan of Arch Hall Jr or Carolyn Brandt, I recommend you see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sadist/dp/B000087F1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sadist</a>&nbsp;(1963).

1921751,4,B0000D1FG6,"I am surprised to read some of the bad review's here. Obviously these reviewer's aren't familiar with the works of Arch Hall jr.and Sr. or classic b-movie schlock. This is the kind of stuff I grew up on at the drive-in and on Sat. afternoon's hosted by Dr. Shock(who incidentally was my dad's best friend Joe). Arch Hall jr. is actually pretty great here, his acting seemed to improve with each movie..I agree with the other reviewer that this is second best after The Sadist. I really think we all lost out when Arch gave up movies to become a pilot. Westerns were never my bag..I found this one surprisingly enjoyable. Great storyline. I would definately watch it again.

1921755,1,B0000D1FG6,"Charles Barkley said it and never more appropirate than with this drive-in triple weekend bill I would imagine.  The thing most disturbing and why the uprising on the Pine Ridge Res several years later was inevitable is how the Native People were portrayed.  I find it very offensive and skewed.  This alone should stop any further showing of this film!  It's not humor, but lowbrow entertainment for those white folks whose IQ's have to be below 90 on the Stanford-Benet!",1401926400,,472,4.8625
1921756,3,B0000D1FG6,"Both the plot and the production values of this film are so bad that you cannot look away.  Honestly, it is really, really, bad.  It makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like a great feature film.

 As a kid, I loved this film.. perhaps because it had a cool sounding name.  The blonde actor in the lead isn't much of an actor, but his eyes are very expressive.  The plot meanders around a bit with some silliness and has very little basis in reality.. There is a confrontation with Wild Bill Hickok and the blonde haired hero is confused with Billy the Kid.  A long lost father figures in there somewhere.. but it is really a lame film.

  I enjoyed getting it and viewing it just to see that the films I liked as a kid don't always have the same appeal now that I have reached adulthood.  This one allowed me to laugh at myself for ever liking it.",1393286400,,847,4.198757763975156
