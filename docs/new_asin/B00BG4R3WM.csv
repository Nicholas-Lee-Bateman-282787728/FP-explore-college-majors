5616147,2,B00BG4R3WM,"I ordered this video because my uncle was married to one of the Lehman's daughters. In fact he is represented in the movie. He was James. I don't know if they didn't have access to a picture or what but he was 6' 8"" tall & didn't have a mustache. The acting was like watching a school play but the message was good.",1393632000,3,315,4.015873015873016

5616149,5,B00BG4R3WM,"This movie is based on the true story behing a classic hymn sung in churches. I enjoyed this movie. But i love watching movies in this time period. Not the best acting by all characters and slightly an ""unreal"" family but still the movie kept my interest. No this is NOT a musical. The SONG is only sung once at the end.
The special features on the dvd -has a song contest that was held and of course it is the same song sung by all the people -it was interesting to watch each one put there own little ""spin"" on the song. I really enjoyed that.
This is a great family movie and one that is based on truth. I highly recommend it it.",1386547200,7,632,4.064

5616158,2,B00BG4R3WM,"The film does show a lot of devotion to God.
I expected to be inspired since the movie was about the writing of a hymn.
Unfortunately the movie moved at a snail's pace and the plot was especially boring.
The children talked and talked, without saying much.
I kept watched the film because I wanted to hear the hymn that was written, but even the hymn was mediocre.
I can't think of any reason to watch this movie.",1467072000,,413,4.3076923076923075
5616159,5,B00BG4R3WM,"Loved this movie and the amazing story of how one of my favorite hymns, The Love of God, came to be. It is also story about the faith of one family as they endure many hardships and trials. It was a sweet story and a wholesome movie that the entire family can enjoy. I admit, the acting isn't the best and it is a lower budget film, but I still loved it and would want to re-watch it. It was such a sweet movie, that I purchased it for a friend's birthday, too. She had shared that she wanted the hymn sung at her funeral because it is so wonderful.

O love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall for evermore endure
The saints' and angels' song.",1454889600,,671,4.083333333333333

8567977,4,B00BG4R3WM,"We REALLY liked this... no Hollywood blockbuster for acting, directing, set or design BUT it's message was fantastic.  It did a terrific job answering the questions my own children have had, growing up in a Christian home and making their belief in God their own.  It does well with the difficulty of taking the Truth out of the mere intellect in making it an issue of the heart that will result in action.  I would have to research the accuracy of the history of this particular hymn but it is a hymn that our family loves and our church body of believers sings often.  Thank you to the folks who put this together!!!!
BTW  The main character, though a young boy did a fantastic job playing his part!",1515283200,4,701,4.4453125

8567980,5,B00BG4R3WM,"A tale of a close family during WWI, focusing in on the preteen son of the family. The family is in financial difficulty and the eldest son leaves for war. The hero is determined to find a way to get a lot of money to help his family. He organizes the younger kids and they come up with - and carry out a plan in a very thoughtful way. Though the hero is a preteen, the content is geared toward all ages, and is really meaningful for adults.

I would say that this movie shines in these ways; 1. The family interaction and care for each other is unusual and refreshing 2. The boy's quest involves solving a kind of riddle and finding a certain man he knows nothing about. He and the other kids carry that out very thoughtfully, which really draws you in. 3. The family has a crisis and so does the hero, and the answer to his heart's cry, his quest, and the family crisis are all intertwined. 4. The messages of the movie are poignant but not overworked. They fall into the story naturally and you come away refreshed and challenged - possibly thinking some new thoughts... A very rare message that I have never seen addressed in any other film.

May be a bit slow moving for kids under 9.",1510099200,4,1189,4.256637168141593
8567981,5,B00BG4R3WM,"Heart warming journey of a young boy who is seeking to learn what it means to love God. Totally related to his quest. Recommend for the whole family. The only negative is that some of the actors are quite cheesy. However, the children totally charmed me and so I still give it a 5",1507248000,3,280,4.203703703703703
