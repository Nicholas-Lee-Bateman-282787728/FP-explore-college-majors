4329971,2,B004CYF79Y,I loved the series and thought that this would be interesting.  It wasn't. Instead it was just a group of ordinary people speaking without benefit of writers.,1388534400,,158,4.851851851851852
4329972,5,B004CYF79Y,It is always great to be able to understand what the creators were thinking.  Small details can make you appreciate the whole.,1387152000,2,126,4.7272727272727275
4329973,5,B004CYF79Y,"Just wonderful, so much fun to see the actors as themselves.  Loved it!  I miss the show so much and wish it weren't finished.",1374364800,,126,4.208333333333333
4329974,5,B004CYF79Y,"I have watched many of the interview shows from the Paley Center. The Closer Cast stands out as one of the best. Very professional, done with candor and shows a true understanding of role their audience plays. Highly recommend you watch it. If you love the show, the interview is insight into the characters and actors. Kyra lovers will enjoy her candid views and genuine love for her character.  If you can;t gt enough of The Closer, watch this show.",1368489600,6,451,4.6375
4329975,5,B004CYF79Y,"I order for my friend, who is a Mary McDonnell fan.  She enjoyed viewing it and is always looking for more DVD's with her in it.",1365120000,,128,3.923076923076923
4329976,5,B004CYF79Y,"What an fun hour, seeing and hearing these people all as they are in real life! Very interesting anecdotes, and very enjoyable for anyone who loves The Closer!",1360800000,2,159,4.714285714285714
4329977,5,B004CYF79Y,"Watched this on Prime, and I liked it so much I'm buying the DVD as well.  The cast pictured are all who participate - noticeable absences were J.K. Simmons, G.W. Bailey, and Corey Reynolds.  I only started watching The Closer when Mary McDonnell began to guest star, so I'm biased to like this as she was on the panel.  Overall, it was a balanced interview with a majority of the cast and Duff getting to participate.  There were some VERY funny moments.  All in all, you can't lose if you're a huge fan of The Closer or any of the actors/actresses from the cast.",1358812800,9,564,4.384615384615385
4329978,3,B004CYF79Y,It's ok but not great.  It seems to be a victim of its own format. The way the cast are interviewed and the setting are a bit lacking. I was hoping to have learned more about 'behind the scenes'. It's also unfortunate that several of the actors did not participate. Good to see once.,1304035200,7,283,4.2407407407407405
4329999,3,B004CYF79Y,Good I miss brenda,1461715200,,18,3.75
4330000,5,B004CYF79Y,"If you're a fan of The Closer, you will really enjoy this look inside the series and hearing from cast members as they reflect on their last season. Kyra Sedgwick was a favorite before I first saw this series and she was absolutely stunning throughout the show's history. But this is truly an ensemble cast, and they all contributed in this live show as they did during the series. I really enjoyed it.",1457481600,,402,4.52054794520548

4330006,5,B004CYF79Y,I like the TV series very much. It was nice to see the actors as real people. I would like to know the name of the new show that has many of the same actors in it or at least what network it's on.,1446940800,,196,3.477272727272727

4330045,4,B004CYF79Y,Paley Center discussions are always fun.  I wish this was a little longer in the shows history.  So many great hours of TV.,1420416000,,123,4.304347826086956
4330046,5,B004CYF79Y,"5 stars for anything ""CLOSER""",1419292800,,29,5.0
4330047,5,B004CYF79Y,"Also enjoyed hearing the Background Personnel talk about this series, and most of all, Kyra as herself (great actor).
It really came out that this cast had a lot of fun working together (as it always comes across, in each episode).
All these actors have a good sense of humor, about themselves & the relationships the characters have with one another (on screen).
I did NOT get the impression that anyone of them thought working on this show was a tense experience.
If you enjoyed THE CLOSER then you'll enjoy this video.",1417996800,,521,4.673913043478261
4330048,5,B004CYF79Y,Truly interesting discussion of a great show.,1417824000,,45,5.571428571428571
4330049,3,B004CYF79Y,"Either they need to give the folks more time or  maybe, perhaps fewer people.  I would've liked to hear more than there was time for from several cast members, but they each only got a couple minutes each.  A little background from each participant but no time to really delve into acting choices or past roles and experience.  So I guess I can say it was okay for what it accomplished but lacked real substance.  I'm a fan of the series and this won't change that, so hopefully there'll be another, with a little more time for Major Crimes when the occasion arises.",1417564800,,566,4.456310679611651
4330050,5,B004CYF79Y,Love the comedy and love shown by this cast from a great show.,1415923200,,62,3.8461538461538463

4330053,2,B004CYF79Y,"I LOVE The Closer and devour it on my Kindle.  However, I tried to watch this and didn't care for it at all.  About 15 minutes in, I gave up.",1413676800,,141,3.6666666666666665
4330054,4,B004CYF79Y,I was surprised to find from AMAZON after almost 2 hours on the phone that when you PURCHASE a movie or TV show to your instant library you  don't OWN it! You can't download it or get an hard copy. If you lose access to the  Internet or the site for (1 minute or 20 years) you lose hundreds of dollars of your movies and TV shows. This does not seem like a good deal. The representative said this IS the policy but it MAY change in the future. .,1413417600,,445,3.933333333333333
4330060,5,B004CYF79Y,Just wish more of the cast had been there.,1408665600,,42,3.7777777777777777
4330061,5,B004CYF79Y,Quite entertaining.  This ensemble cast was fabulous.  They really enjoyed working together as you can conclude from this interview.,1405728000,,132,5.894736842105263
4330062,1,B004CYF79Y,It was not what I was looking for in a show. All the stars that I was looking for did not show up for the interview. I want to see all the main stars.,1403136000,,150,3.4411764705882355
4330063,4,B004CYF79Y,Where was Lt Provencia? Without him the show would not have lasted this long. He added so much to the show.,1399766400,,107,4.142857142857143
4330064,5,B004CYF79Y,"If only this cast would come back and do more episodes of this really wonderful show.  I am now enjoying season 3..and I'm sorry that's it will be over for me, soon.",1398988800,,165,4.15625
4330065,1,B004CYF79Y,"My rating is not based on content.  I could never get it to play. It would just stop and freeze. I had to turn it off and restart it. It kept freezing. After multiple tries I gave up.

I use my Roku device to play videos and I have never had this problem before or since.",1398470400,,271,3.8214285714285716
4330066,5,B004CYF79Y,"Pleasant discussion of the origins of the characters and the stories. I loved the family and personal connections of BL Johnson and Kyra Sedgewick seems to have insisted on their inclusion in the show for her participation. It was fun hearing Jon Tenney is the cast's favorite jokester and the actor playing Provenza tells great and funny stories. Missed him on this panel. The writer's surprise that Johnson's character, based on himself, his mother and sister, was flawed is a great moment to behold.",1395705600,,502,4.988095238095238
4330067,5,B004CYF79Y,Very enjoyable look into the ensemble cast who were filled with well-earned pride for this outstanding series. You will watch it over and over as you enjoy the personal side of the cast and creators. Well worth the purchase.,1395532800,,224,4.769230769230769

4330069,5,B004CYF79Y,Great stories made alive by very talented actors. It's nice to see a very strong woman with a real vulnerability. Funny too! A must see inside look.,1392422400,,148,4.518518518518518

8423810,5,B004CYF79Y,"The Closer was one of my very favorite series of all my years as a television watcher!
I loved all the characters, especially Brenda and Fritz but also the parents and the detectives. Oh well, I guess that means I loved them all!!
I bought the entire series on my Kindle and rewatched episodes time and again.",1476144000,,309,4.43859649122807
