7850969,4,6303578055,"Genji's mother died when he was young, and he's been looking for her in all of his relationships with women ever since.  And there are a *lot* of relationships: I had trouble at first figuring out who was sleeping with  whom, and who was related to whom.  The Tale of Genji is full of moving  imagery and symbolism, but be prepared for a lot of beautiful, quiet,  prolonged sequences where nothing much happens.  There's even a  Kubrick-esque dream sequence at the end; as confusing and anti-resolution  as the end of 2001. :)  The music is wonderful as well, and I've never said  that about any other anime I've seen.",949708800,22,618,4.587155963302752
7850970,5,6303578055,"This animated film, based pretty faithfully on the first one third of the classic novel The Tale of Genji by Lady Murasaki, is a beautiful and haunting representation of eleventh century Heian Japan, a pessimistic and  Buddhist era during which the fictional character Genji Hotaru (The Shining  Genji) seeks love and meaning.  Many have accused it of lacking plot and  energy, which may be accurate; however, that is not the point of the film  or the twelve hundred page novel, which is highly atmospheric.  The film  might be slightly confusing for the viewer who has not read The Tale of  Genji, but I don't believe that only those who have read the novel or  researched Heian Japan will enjoy it.  It is a quietly sad and beautiful  story which gives the viewer visual insight into the peculiar lifestyle of  the Heian Japanese individual, and he can experience the curiosities of  polygamy, spirit posession, Buddhism/Shinto ceremony, and the cult of  beauty.  The audial aspects of this film are also very alluring; the  combination of the unusual tones of the traditional Japanese instruments  and the sounds of the characters' environment (swishing silk kimono,  dripping oil lamps, the brushing of hair) is incredibly sensuous. True, it  is very unhurried and focuses on details that many animated films would  neglect; and not everyone would find this interesting.  Still, while this  film isn't at all an example of the popular sci-fi action anime which draws  such a crowd, it is a poignantly gorgeous utilization of the techniques of  Japanese animation artists which illustrates a few preciously mysterious  and aesthetically moving moments during the golden era of Japan.",946339200,69,1686,5.110294117647059

7850973,3,6303578055,"This animation movie was made in Japan and is subtitled.  The story is  void of any action and has a slow story line.  It is an excerpt out of the  famous ancient Japanese book by the same title by Murasaki Shikibu.  The  Tale of Genji tells of the non-fictional character Genji who is court  prince in the times of Japan (c. 1000 AD). Only recommended for animation or  Japanese Historical enthusiasts. However, the animation is near perfect for  realism and for those students of history it has a lot to offer about  ancient Japanese Culture.  END",908755200,13,549,4.614583333333333
