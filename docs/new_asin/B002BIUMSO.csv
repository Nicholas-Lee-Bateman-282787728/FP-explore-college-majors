8361463,3,B002BIUMSO,"As a New York born Askenazi Jew with family line from Germany and Grudna and having grownup with father and grandmother bantering in Jewish (Yiddish), I enjoyed seeing this program as my father shared the same love of Yiddish as Hershel Bernardi. However, Hershel expressing his passion for Yiddish and Yiddish Theater bordered on the depressing instead of nostalgia. I get him, but I left gloomy.",1518998400,,397,5.03030303030303
8361464,5,B002BIUMSO,Just the whole story about the start of the yiddish theater,1518912000,,59,4.454545454545454
8361465,5,B002BIUMSO,"I have seen the program before, and I love watching it over and over again.",1497225600,,75,4.066666666666666
8361466,5,B002BIUMSO,I really enjoyed this film. Very well done and Naarated by some of my favorite yiddish actors. It really brings to life the era where yiddish film was in it's hayday.,1382918400,,166,4.387096774193548
8361467,3,B002BIUMSO,"This DVD was not as good as I expected it to be.  Perhaps because the era was so long ago and media was not as readily available as for more current ""ages.""  The coverage of topics was not ""in full and complete.""",1375833600,,212,4.023809523809524
8361468,5,B002BIUMSO,"This delightful documentary about Yiddish theater covers the subject so thoroughly and with such passion and obvious affection that it is the definitive video treatment of this subject. I first watched it years ago as a theater lover with no knowledge of Yiddish stage traditions, and came away from it with an abiding love for the subject. I have watched this time and again with fresh delight, and cannot recommend it too highly.",1374105600,,431,4.917808219178082
8361469,5,B002BIUMSO,"It's very well done. A piece of history with interviews and profiles of the people who were there. Herschel Bernardi's narration and recollections are wonderful for me, who missed this era.",1373328000,,189,5.129032258064516
8361470,4,B002BIUMSO,"This is a great video of the Jewish/Yiddish age of performers of the beginning of the twentieth century; the video quality is OK, but this material is a treasure for those interested in this vital piece of American, as well as Jewish- American history. Shalom Alechem.",1366675200,,268,4.8478260869565215
8361471,3,B002BIUMSO,"When seen on WNET in New York on occasion, this was always a special and welcome documentary -- a bold attempt at capturing a broad topic with only limited resources, limited budget, and a tiny crew...  but lots of heart and lots of love for the history of the Yiddish Theater in Manhattan.  While I can say that the entire documentary has been properly transfered to DVD, the picture quality doesn't seem all that much better than that of the aging film copies.  PLUS (and this is nearly unforgivable), Cantor Films (who produced the original documentary), attempts to remove the true artfulness and soul of this quirky and personal documentary by doctoring up the imagery, adding new sources of film and stills to the narrative, and generally trying to ""enhance"" the product with contemporary additions which only take away from the purity of the original product's vision.  This fits into the mediocrity of our time, that a good original work cannot be allowed to stand on its own.

A fitting reissue would simply have allowed viewers the doctored version alongside the undoctored version.  I was disappointed with my purchase and now still long to have one clean copy of ""The Golden Age of Second Avenue"" as filmed and printed.  Additionally, there are no special features on the disc suggesting how the documentary was created.",1284249600,13,1332,4.919642857142857
