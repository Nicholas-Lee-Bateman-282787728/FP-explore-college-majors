8602999,4,B00E9HXHX2,"""Haruschi, Sohn des Doktor Fu Man Chu"" is a ""feature"" reduction of Republic's 15-chapter serial from 1943, ""G-Men vs. the Black Dragon"" involving a Japanese master spy, Baron Oyama Haruchi (Nino Pipitone) trying to sabotage the American war effort, pursued by ""special agent"" Rex Bennett (Rod Cameron), British agent Vivian Marsh (Constance Worth) and Chang Sing (Roland Got) of the Chinese Secret Service.  Directed by William Witney, it is one of Republic's best, filled with action, stunts and special effects.  Unfortunately it has yet to appear in a satisfactory DVD edition, and this German release from Filmjuwelen is no exception.  While the technical quality of the source is very good, it is cut into two ""features"" of about 75 minutes each, probably for television use and edited to remove not only the titles between chapters, but also scenes that appear to have been thought too stressful or disturbing for children, which of course are the parts children (and others) would most like to see.  Yes, the end of Chapter Eight is gone, where Vivian Marsh is placed in front of the spear-throwing machine.  Even worse for its effect on the plot, the resolution of the cliffhangers is often omitted.  For example, while some of the fist fight and explosion of the paint company at the end of Chapter One are still there, the story suddenly resumes in Rex Bennett's office without a clue as to how our heroes escaped.  There is also no explanation of how Dr. Fu Manchu got into the title, but I guess that's ""artistic license.""  Some of the ""deleted scenes"" are available through the main menu, but without provision for viewing them in sequence with the film.  These scenes have only the original soundtrack, but are mostly ""action"" with just a couple fragments of dialogue.  The film's credits list Deutsche Mondial-Film G.M.B.H. as having done the German version, and also display Republic's 1943 copyright so it appears to be an officially-sanctioned release.  A booklet is included (in German) with a discussion of the serial and a few images from the film, but it has nothing about the origin of the two ""features.""

Despite the editing problems, the DVD has its virtues.  First, though, I should mention that while this is a ""Region 0"" disc, it is in PAL format which won't work on most DVD players sold in North America.  ""All Region"" players will work, as will those with a selection for ""PAL"" mode, and it will also play on computer drives without changing the region setting.  Now for the virtues.  The image quality is superb, sharper and having better detail than Republic's Laserdisc, and far better than those ""bootleg"" copies of it.  The picture is modified only where a couple hand-written notes are shown in German instead of English.  The dialogue has been dubbed in German with good lip sync, though in many places the title music from Republic's serial ""Zorro's Black Whip"" is used in the background.  The original English is on the alternate audio channel, crisp and clear if with a small amount of noise.  No subtitles have been provided in either language.  Unfortunately, like many PAL-system transfers the film was run at 25 frames per second to avoid the jerky motion known as ""telecine judder.""  This causes the sound to be pitched 4% high, almost a semitone and enough to be noticed in the quality of the actors' voices.  Republic's old editions had a similar problem, though the reason for that speed-up was to cram the original 244 minutes of the serial on four Laserdisc sides, which actually caused some roughness in the motion of some scenes.

This isn't the best choice for those interested in the entire serial, and even those who prefer ""feature"" versions would need to contend with the less-than-optimal editing, though the plot is not hard to follow.  But the pieces that are present are of excellent video quality, better than any previous video release of it, and for that I give it a 4-star ""I like it"" rating even if I would be a lot happier if it was the whole serial at the correct speed.",1439510400,,4040,4.828737300435414
