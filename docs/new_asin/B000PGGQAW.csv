8212464,5,B000PGGQAW,"This boxed set of 'TV Classic Westerns' from 2003 in my collection holds 10 feature films on two DVD discs.  Ten episodes in all on digitally enhanced audio 5.1 discs, digially mastered full screen, with interactive menus, scene access, all in glorious black and white.  But as kid watching ole Roy, he almost always showed up in black and white.

The features on these 2 discs are as follows:

Hands Across The border
Billy The Kid Returns
Eyes Of Texas
Bells Of Rosarita
Grand Canyon Trail
Heldorado
Roll On Texas Moon
Under Nevada Skies
West Of The Badlands
Young Bill Hickok

Many of these films have shown recently on Encore Westerns and may be familiar to many western fans. But this set, as well as others, from Platinum Disc Corporation puts them in a fan's home library.  And best of all, these films are all 'rated for all-suitable for all audiences.

If you are a fan of Roy Rogers this is a great set to spend time with. Saddle up and ride, podners!
