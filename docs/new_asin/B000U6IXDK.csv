2917129,1,B000U6IXDK,"Have you ever seen one of those movies that is so bad it's actually fun to watch? You know, ""Dungeons and Dragons,"" ""The Room,"" ""Hobgoblins,"" just about anything riffed on by the MST3K crowd...

Well, these are not that kind of film. ""Baby Geniuses"" and ""Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies"" are the kind of movies that melt your brain to a lumpy paste, and reduce you to a drooling vegetable unable to speak, move, or use the bathroom. These two movies are a putrid stew of ghastly writing, ghastly special effects, idiotic plotting and horrendous roles for well-respected actors.

The (TRULY IDIOTIC) premise for the movies is that babies are all secretly brilliant, and have their own special language that adults are too stupid to decipher. They also know kung-fu and quote bad 90s comedy movies.

So the first movie is about scientists who are trying to create the most intelligent babies in the world (I'm not sure why) under the guidance of Kathleen Turner and Christopher Lloyd. But then one of the babies escapes, and is accidentally switched with his twin brother who is being raised by Turner's niece (Kim Cattrall). Hijinks ensue.

And then there's ""Superbabies"" -- which, according to IMDB, is actually considered the worst film of all time. This one focuses on a ""Superbaby"" (actually, more like a kindergartener) called The Kahuna, who thwarts the evil machinations of Jon Voight. When a MacGuffin disk falls into a stroller containing four regular babies, they and their babysitter become enmeshed in an evil plot to... do something.

It honestly blows my mind that the man who directed these abominations was the man who also gave us the brilliant ""Christmas Story,"" ""Porky's,"" and ""Black Christmas."" How do you go from comedic brilliant to a brain-damaging dementia of a film like ""Baby Geniuses"" -- and then the even worse ""Superbabies""?

What's wrong with these films? Ghastly special effects (oh look, a toddler's dressing up as John Travolta), cringingly bad dialogue, endless potty humor (""Diaper gravy!""), slapstick that is actually AWARE of how bad it is, and plots that make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. And even worse, they make LESS sense when you actually sit down and think about them. The humor (""Austin Powers"" quotes) often seems to be trying to appeal to adults, but everything else is so repulsively juvenile that no adult would voluntarily watch this.

And... think about the premise. It's about BABIES who are smarter than the adults... because they're babies. And yet they're not toilet trained, can't feed themselves, and can't speak English by the age of two. Can you really take that seriously?

As for the actors.... ye gods, I don't know WHAT real actors like Jon Voight, Kathleen Turner and Christopher Lloyd are doing in these movies. Lloyd has a dead-eyed, robotic look as if he's trying to retreat from the world, Turner looks POed continually, and Voight... well, he seems to be coping by uttering strange random comments (""This machine has damaged my leg!"").

And what about the babies? Well, they're usually played by actual babies who don't look like they know what's going on. Occasionally the production team pasts bad CGI mouths on their faces, and occasionally stick a CGI head on top of a little person. Ugh.

Watch ""The Room."" Watch ""Dungeons and Dragons."" Watch anything but ""Baby Geniuses/Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2"" -- it will leave you feeling dirty, stupid and vaguely confused.",1323561600,,3427,4.996491228070176
