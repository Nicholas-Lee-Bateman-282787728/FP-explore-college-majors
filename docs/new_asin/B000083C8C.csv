7978596,2,B000083C8C,"Sigh...Goodtimes once again distributes an incomplete animated TV series to the US.  The ""first"" DVD, ""Escape to Watership Down"" actually does not have the all important first episode when the rabbits leave Sandleford Warren.  So there is no Fiver's first vision, no Cowslip nor the snare scene at the Warren of Shining Wires.  These episodes DO exist and were broadcast in the UK & Canada.  But Goodtimes seems to think it can get away with giving the American public only a partial product. It is a real travesty when such high-quality children's animation is shortchanged like this.  Whoever is in charge of Goodtimes Family Films Distribution should be taken 'round the barn and put out of our misery.",1094947200,,705,4.940677966101695
7978597,5,B000083C8C,"This DVD set of three episodes of the TV series version of Watership Down produced in Great Britain is an exellent example of high quality animation and, although the story is somewhat altered, is a credit to both the book and the original movie. Martin Rosen, the director of the original movie ""Watership Down"" was more interested in portraying the background of the very beautiful English countryside that the movie is set in. The producer and director of the animated series produced in Great Britain by Nepenthe Productions seemed to aim more toward the character and story angles. As such, the characters are extremely finely drawn while the background has less definition. The story has been simplified and re-written with a young child (appx. 7-13yrs)
in mind. I highly recommend this DVD and the other DVD, ""Journey to Watership Down"" to anyone who has seen the original movie and/or has a small child who likes animation(and what child dosen't?!). Through this animated series children will learn basic values of honesty and integrity, and be better citizens both in their current lives and in their future life.
A Great series for all ages and a true credit to all involved in making it. WELL DONE!",1048636800,,1209,4.931372549019608
