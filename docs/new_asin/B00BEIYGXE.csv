5584339,4,B00BEIYGXE,"For Hollywood, this was a goldmine!! With a budget of only a reported 3 million, this movie exceeded and surpassed expectations! And here is why. The acting was superb, Ethan Hawke and company did an excellent job in portraying the story. The audience felt the families plight, they were right there with them. This ultra violent horror movie actually has heart. The ending will surely suprise any veteran horror movie fan. Excellent film!!! The supporting cast, right down to the most minute part did an excellent job as well. We love love love this movie.....go see it!!!

The only issue I have is that I wish that the story was carried outside of the family, but other than that, it would have been a 5 star!!!

5584340,1,B00BEIYGXE,"I really wanted to like this movie, I really really did.  Looking at the trailer for this movie, it looks like it's ""The Strangers"" only set on a national level.  The premise is that the US was on verge of collapse so in order to fix this, a new group of government officials decides that on one day for twelve hours that all crime is legal.  I guess that idea is that people won't commit crimes any other time a year or do anything violent, because on that one night they can indulge all they want and get it out of their systems.

Going back to the trailer, it looks like we have video coverage from the whole USA that shows people doing violent things all over the country and once in a while we get images from one family's house as they fight off home invaders in creepy masks and outfits.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Seriously, this movie is not what you think it's going to be.  It's just constant social commentary about class warfare and with a little bit of racism thrown in now and then for good measure.  Not to mention a lot of things happening in this movie just don't make sense and the characters are just idiotic!

First of all, the main character played by Ethan Hawke is a security system sales guy.  So he has the top of the line security system in his home so he'll be safe during the Purge.  While driving home his radio is playing and it's people saying the Purge isn't fair because the rich can afford protection and the poor can't.  Then someone calls into the radio station and says they are going to hunt down and kill their boss.  Okay great idea!  Then tomorrow you won't have a job!  If you kill him, your employer is dead, if you fail and he lives then he's going to fire you the next day.  Wouldn't it be easier to just get a new job?  Also it's mentioned that the Purge is used to kill off the lower class of America and the other undesirables of society.  I don't watch movies to hear social commentary and hear people whining about the 1%  I watch movies for escapism and to enjoy myself.

Next the family locks down the house, but one of the kids sees someone outside yelling for help, and stupidly the kid lets this total stranger who is covered in blood and holding a knife into his family's home.  Look, I care about my fellow human beings as much as the next guy, but on a night when all crime is legal, and this man is covered in blood, and is holding a knife, and is asking for me to let him into my home?  Sorry, not gonna happen.  My family's safety takes precedence over a total stranger's safety.

What's crazier is that the daughter's boyfriend sneaks into the house and tries to kill the father so he and the daughter can be together.  Moron!  Do you REALLY think that this girl is still going to love you after you MURDER her father!?!  On what planet does that make sense?

Later the group of psychos that was chasing the bloody stranger shows up and demands that they release the guy outside to them because ""their equipment is arriving,"" and it will allow them to gain entry to their home.  Their ""equipment"" consists of a 4x4 pickup that they hook up to the metal barriers with chains to the doors and just rip them off.  Yeah, that's a great security system.  You spend like $100,000.00 on this thing and it's compromised by a used pick-up truck and some chain from Home Depot.

What I also don't get is why do these weirdoes want to kill this guy so bad anyways?  What's so special about him?  Is it because he's African American?  Because he's homeless?  Because he's a veteran?  Did he do something to them?  Just a little clarity would be nice

Not to mention that during the Emergency Broadcast System alert that shows that all weapons are legal during the Purge.  Okay fine, I can get behind that.  But what doesn't make sense is that for the rest of the year these weapons are illegal.  So how did they get these weapons then?  It's still illegal to buy and own them for the other 364 days of the year.

Plus the idea of the Purge wouldn't work.  The neighbors break in and try to kill the family because they're jealous of the family because they are so rich.  The family fights them off and holds them at gunpoint until the Purge is over at 7am.  Okay good you lived through the night, but they still hate you and they still know that you killed some of them in defense.  Those feelings don't just get swept under the rug.  Seriously, you think you can try to murder someone and the next day they're just gonna wave and smile at you?

Okay now that's enough of this idiotic family.  Please explain to me how making all crime legal for one night is going to save America?  Like, ""Hurray!  Tens of thousands of people were just murdered in cold blood!  America is saved!""  How does that make sense?

This movie was just dumb and it was a waste of time.  I went to see it because it looked creepy and it was made by the people who made Paranormal Activity.  But it's looking more and more like that was the only good movie they ever made.

Give this one a pass.",1370736000,18,5102,4.343584305408272
5584341,5,B00BEIYGXE,"Ok, my whole view on scary movies is probably different from alot of people's views for them. I really just go for something that's going to be creepy make me jump and in rare cases make me laugh. I don't see why everyone complains when there is no story in a scary movie cause look at real life there isn't a story behind every single killing that goes on. But anyways this movie literally scared the crap out of me through the whole thing; the main reason being the idea of a night free for killing is something that actually seems plausible and realistic in the United States. That's one of my favorite type of scary movies because you can relate unlike the completely random made up ideas that are so farfetched you wonder what on earth they were smoking when they came up with the idea. The Purge starts of setting up for future plots and as it goes farther and farther in it just keeps adding more and more twists to the story. Once you figure something out and you're thinking ok so this is what they're doing, BAM it gives you some big twist. I honestly can say it is one of my favorite scary movies and I would watch it over and over and over again and I would recommend this to literally any person who is looking to watch a scary movie.",1370736000,7,1247,4.265822784810126
5584342,2,B00BEIYGXE,"The Purge takes place in the year 2022, unemployment is at 1% and crime is at an all time low. Except for one night every year where anything goes. Crime is a free for all for 12 hours and police and emergency services are unavailable until 7am the next morning.

Ethan Hawke sells security systems, notably, to all of his wealthy neighbors in their gated community. The security systems basically are metal shields that come down over all windows/doors of the homes. On the night of 'The Purge' a man is wounded yelling for help in the middle of the street, of course the young son (maybe 13-14 years old) knows the passcode and unarms the security system and lets him inside. After doing so there's a little scuffle and the man runs off and hides in their large home. And of course they cannot find him until it's too late. Meanwhile, outside a group of young people (in their 20s I'd say) who are participating in 'The Purge' want the man who is inside their home. They give them a deadline to find and release him alive otherwise they will break in and kill that man, along with Ethan Hawke and his family.

The film didn't have the scare factor I was expecting, the majority of the film was predictable, and like most movies had that one idiotic character (that being the son) who sets off a domino effect for everything bad to happen. The film was nothing special (84min run time?) and isn't worth a second viewing. I will say the blonde haired masked man you see in the commercial knocking on the front door did do a good job and was very creepy.

Hopefully this review helps. But if I were to give advice to anyone deciding which film to see in theaters, there are others worth seeing over this.",1370736000,10,1703,4.434504792332269
5584343,4,B00BEIYGXE,"I can see it now.  Someone watching this movie will copy it and every June 7th commit crimes regardless if its against the law or not.  I want to thank the producers and creators for providing yet another great idea to fill there pockets with money.  Human life means nothing and your an obstacle in my way.  Money is everything, and I will do whatever it takes to eliminate the opposition(other people)  Jails fill-up beyond capacity and there is nothing we can do, but defend ourselves and the ones we trust.

5584344,2,B00BEIYGXE,"Films that make political statements aren't anything new, nor are they a revolutionary means of gaining otherwise unlikely attention.  Controversy has always been a means for creating revenue, especially in the United States where people tend to flock to scandalous news stories.  But, before you come after me for generalizing, hear me out.  The Purge, which is the subject of controversy due to comments made by James DeMonaco in relation to The Tea Party and NRA, appear to have stirred quite the commotion for a film that would typically never register on the average movie-goer's radar.  But, when roughly one-third of the United States is clearly conservative, attacking their base with a overbearingly apocalyptic film seems like a great way to aggravate that one-third, while still forcing them to go see the film in order to figure out what all the talk is about.  When you take that logic into account, mix it with a liberally-charged subject matter and the unremarkably high interest for blood-spillage from teenagers and young adults, you have quite the cocktail for success.

The Purge, directed by James DeMonaco (Staten Island), stars Ethan Hawke as James Sandin, a home security developer that sells security systems to home owners in anticipation of a yearly 12-hour period, called ""The Purge.""  During the 12 hour window, the New Founding Fathers of America (government) allow Americans to ""purge"" themselves of crime, hate, and murder by legalizing these acts (with certain exceptions).  James Sandin and his wife, Mary (Lena Headey), along with their two kids, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Henry (Tony Oller), decide to stay in for ""the purge,"" believing in its cause, but not partaking in the events.  However, the evening of The Purge takes a turn for the worst when Henry aids a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge) begging for salvation outside the Sandin's residence.  The man's assailants, including the cryptic polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield), demand his release before they ""purge"" the entire Sandin family, too.  Arija Bareikis and Chris Mulkey also star in supporting roles.

It's difficult to watch this film without focusing on the underlying themes that are completely in your face for its entirety.  The idiotic rational featured in this film states that America is better off if its citizens are given a 12 hour window to commit atrocities.  On the flip side, the government believes that if Americans are given this 12-hour window of ""freedom,"" it alleviates crime and promotes job growth, along with economic prosperity for the remaining 364 days of the year.  Still, it's bothersome to think that people can simply go on a 12-hour crime/killing spree, and just go back to their regular lives the following day without any carry over.  They say once you've killed once, it's likely you'll do it again.  However, with that logic in mind, it's difficult to imagine any of these individuals would be able to wait a full year to kill or commit a crime again.  This film obviously gives the mind plenty to contemplate and it certainly creates a different way of thinking about the future direction of civilization.  Regardless, the film's premise is a complete and utter rip-off of the classic 1967 Star Trek episode, The Return of the Archons, in which an evil dictator rewards his minions with a similar 12-hour window to pillage and plunder an entire planet's civilians.

Themes aside, there's very little about The Purge that separates itself from the array of unlawful entry films, not to mention the classic slasher films featuring Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees.  The abundance of stupid mistakes and clichs (like characters that still hide under the bed) really hurt this film, especially in the later half after the film turns into more a ""so stupid it's funny"" horror flick than a spine-tingling thriller.  For instance, if the son hadn't invited the random stranger into his house, the whole situation could have been avoided.  Of course, that wouldn't make for a very interesting movie - but it always takes something away from the film when the majority of viewers don't believe the situation is visible, especially in the horror genre.  For there, there's a series of irritating questions, like why are a large group of blood-thirsty individuals hell bent on ""purging"" spending so much time on won random bum/war veteran.  It makes the film feel like a whole lot of wasted time with very little reward.

To be honest, the lack of star-power hasn't been a very big concern for the horror genre.  However, The Purge's leading man, Ethan Hawke, is far from an unrecognizable face.  Surprisingly, Hawke makes an enjoyable protagonist, but he just lacked the proper antagonist in this film.  His nemesis for the film, credited as the ""polite stranger"" is reminiscent of a watered-down version of Heath Ledger's joker persona.  If the joker were 15 years younger and starring in a CW version of Batman, he may have resembled the performance of the relatively unknown Rhys Wakefield.  And, to be honest, the kid (Henry) is rather creepy in the film, even though he turns out to be utterly harmless.  Tony Oller's portrayal is commendable, and even though he had the look of a future Michael Myers follower, (small spoiler) he turns out to be the voice of reason in the family's darkest hour.

Overall, The Purge is a silly movie filled with a ton of potshots at America.  The film is chalk full of liberal bias, but is it anti-American?  Well, that's a matter of personal opinion, but the fact that a film like this can be made (even if the director is using his own personal criticism) means the First Amendment is alive and well.  The premise of this film is intriguing, although the execution is comical.  This is a difficult film to recommend, but it squeaks through mostly due to the high amount of enjoyment it provides should you be lucky enough to see it with a large group of people.  Due to the highly successful opening weekend, The Purge will no doubt have a sequel on the way.  Odds are on summer 2014.

5584345,3,B00BEIYGXE,"A ridiculous premise may or may not deter people from venturing into ""The Purge"" and that may or may not be justified. A re-born American government has managed to eliminate crime, poverty and unemployment by allowing for one night, one 12-hour period a year, where there are no laws and no emergency services. For one night, murder, theft and whatever people of devious mind can think of, is legal. It is a simple premise and a silly premise. Although the creators of ""The Purge"", the movie, James DeManaco and Michael Bay, aren't necessarily trying to make an accurate statement, but a social one.

The movie focuses on one family, the Sandin's; most noteably the father, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke). James is the man who marketed and sold the ultimate security system to all of the rich elite who can afford to be safe on a night like the Purge. Their homes are locked down and impenetrable, or are they? Well, if they were, we wouldn't have a movie now would we?

""The Purge"" has its moments of silliness; most of that in the final third of the movie. I have to admit that I was hooked though, for a bit. The tension builds nicely and you get to know the family enough that you care for them and their situation. The movie also tries to make a social statement about the Government and how people all have pent up anger and violent tendencies. Allowed to release that pent up and inevitable tendency for a short period, in theory, opens the door for 364 days of non-violence.

The movie focuses its attention narrowly, which damages this attempt to make a wide government statement. The social statement works to an extent, although much of the finality of the film is spoiled by some silly staged moments, like people praying around their innocent and unarmed targets before doing the violent deed. Of course, anytime you see someone explaining what he or she is doing or pausing before doing something, it is almost always a lame setup for someone to interfere or spoil the plan.

If you are going into ""The Purge"" expecting to see this premise explain itself or justify itself, save your money.  It isn't going to do it and you will inevitably come out thinking that the movie was as stupid as you assume it is.  The moviemakers aren't trying to justify this premise as something that is feasible; they are making a social comment in a fictional world. If you study the intent behind the characters actions given this one night opportunity, you will enjoy the movie much more.

Regardless of which audience member you are though, the ending will inevitably leave you disappointed. The carnage and unpredictability takes a dramatic u-turn in the movies final third, becoming clich&eacute;' and safe. It built and built and then leveled off to a typical Hollywood, test-audience ruined dud. They could have done so much more to make people forget the premise and enjoy the film and they didn't.",1370563200,,2898,4.715415019762846

5584392,3,B00BEIYGXE,"That pretty much sums it up. As a horror film The Purge is weak and takes cheap shots at trying to startle the audience more than actually instilling any kind of real fear or intensity for most of the movie. In the annals of the horror genre it is totally forgettable and rife with techniques and imagery done from previous and more successful horror films. As a sci-fi thriller however this movie has a good deal more potential. If you are not a horror movie fan don't worry, this isn't really a horror movie. However if you like thriller with a little suspense (even if often times stilted) with a ""what if?"" kind of theme this may keep you occupied.

The Purge is about a near future where unemployment is almost non-existent and violent crime is at an all time low. This is due to the fact that in just a few years from now a radical new concept sweeps America: Purge. This happens once a year from 7pm to 7am. You are completely free to commit any crime without any legal consequences. One affluent man and his family bunker down for the night in their house sealed by metal doors and bars. The man's son rescues a stranger being hunted by a group of privileged teens. Now the teens do their purge on the family instead. As hard as it is to accept this sort of reality happening just a few years away I do admit I like the concept. There is a whole set of societal observations that the movie touches on briefly that make the premise fascinating. This is one of the better ideas to come out of the horror genre.

Unfortunately it's still a movie trying to be a horror film. Early on when there is really nothing happening but setting up the plot for later they already try to put in some ""gotcha"" moments trying to startle you out of your seat in the most unnecessary moments. That's pretty much how all the scares end up being. Trying to catch you off guard after showing you dark shadowy things move in the distance or a person skulking in the background. While the imagery is cool the scary effect is non-existent. It's been done already... too many times. Now I won't say the movie doesn't have it's moments where the tension is genuine and you get a bit of spine tingling going on, but it's not what I call horror. This movie is better served if it were presented along the lines of films like The Panic Room, as a thriller instead of a straight up scary movie.

As a thriller the movie makes more sense. The assailants and their creepy masks give off a more cool effect than intimidating. Lead purger (played by Rhys Wakefield) becomes an awesome and disturbed villain more likened to Heath Ledger's Joker instead of a pretty face we are supposed to fear. The themes and challenges about how you accept or not accept the night of purging the movie puts out are actually thought provoking. Everything jibes better in this angle. If they focused more on the emotional themes and character development and less on how many time they can make you jump or worry who is in the shadows they would have a much better movie as a whole.

Acting is impressive actually. Ethan Hawke plays the dad and does a good transition from rich salesman trying to make time with family and support the purge to a man challenged by the morality of it all. I'm glad they gave Ethan some dimension to work with along with a character with more surprises than you would normally see in a film like this. Lena Headey plays his wife and does also gets some great character development that moves her in different directions of both frailty and strength. Rhys Wakefield totally eats up the screen with his amoral baddie. Performances like these really help save the film.

video quality is good, but don't expect anything standout. The film a full 1080p-AVC encoded, but it's also mostly a dark, shadowy film with muted colors and some blur to some scenes added for effect. The blu-ray is still a better visual presentation than the DVD by a noticeable margin. The Purge makes full use of the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track with plenty of little noises to try and build tension over. The sound is well balanced between the little noises and the regular dialog, so that's good. The is only one extra in this blu-ray. Surviving the Night: The Making of The Purge. It in high-definition and runs just under ten minutes. It does give a lot of information and background to the film, focusing more on those things that make this a good thriller (which you would think would be enough of a hint if they see them too).

The Purge is not a good horror movie, but it is a decent thriller delving into a possible future where one night out of the year America falls into complete anarchy. This particular scenario has so much potential on the world building side, the morality side, and the possibilities for an action thriller are gold. So take this movie as a decent introduction to this crazy world, but don't expect something super intense.",1420502400,,4923,4.507278835386338

5584429,1,B00BEIYGXE,"The Purge has a ridiculous premise that took itself far too seriously.  The movie is based on a plot that is too outlandish to make enjoyable, yet tries to pass itself off as having high amounts of validity as if this would actually become a reality in the future. The fact that any part of the plot would work in real life renders the remainder of the film meaningless, but the added cliche characters who have the depth of a kiddie pool and the added cliche of ""just when the bad guy is about to kill the character, someone off screen shoots them"" which occurred like 5 times in a row, made the film even less enjoyable.

Lack of depth in characters, terrible dialog, boring and unbelievable script, nothing added up at all for me. It was a home invasion film based upon a terrible idea and it did nothing new in the genre. There's literally dozens of home invasion films that have done the whole thing better. No need to see one that is focused around such a thin premise.  If it's trying to be make a political or social statement then it fails miserably, Clockwork Orange is a film that gets political commentary correct.

If crime was legal for 12 hours, there would be no way to stop people from committing crimes forever, even protests get out of control, why would legal crime be organized? Second, why is murder the only crime occurring? Wouldn't more people be inclined to rob one another on a day that crime is legal? Shouldn't people be at the nearest Lexus, Porsche and Ferrari dealerships stealing everything in sight? Third, the reasons for killing people were so miniscule and far-fetched. Fourth, it came off as a bad way to just make a home invasion film, a bad home invasion film. If you want good home invasion films then watch any of these instead: Funny Games; The Strangers; House of the Devil; Inside; I Spit On Your Grave; Eden Lake; High Tension; Clockwork Orange; Cape Fear; Hard Candy; Last House on the Left or any of the other home invasion films out there.

5584434,5,B00BEIYGXE,"Nine Things About the Movie The Purge [USA, 2013]

1. Despite how it was advertised, this is not a horror movie. The sooner you realize this, the better.

2. This is a dark, violent, well-acted, and uncomfortable allegory about the American class system.

3. The movie takes place over a span of 13 hours. Ethan Hawke plays a well-meaning, but rather rigid, father that lives in a very wealthy gated community with his family. They settle into their home for the evening behind their state-of-the-art security system to keep out of The Purge. The Purge is a night where all crime is legal. This is designed to let Americans vent their frustration, anger, and violent impulses, so that the rest of the year everyone can get along better. Anyway, the two kids end up compromising the security of their house, and the family must defend their lives from psycho college students who want things the family has.

3 There are some parts of the movie that, at first, seem dumb or unrealistic. But if you look at those instances as metaphor, the whole movie unlocks and begins to make sense.

4. This movie is less concerned with telling an actual story, and more concerned with examining issues of entitlement, envy, the dangers of using God as a foundation of patriotism, and the deep dehumanization of others (as well as the self) that is required to keep those things going.

5. The home-invasion thriller part of the movie is well-acted and has some surprises.

6. There is a lot of violence in this movie, but not like some people expect. It is not about showing rampant carnage so that the audience can experience their own Purge vicariously. The epic idea of the movie is scaled way down to become an intimate experience. This disappointed a lot of people.

7. This movie is not about the Purge, but about the reactions and consequences to living with such a system as The Purge.

8. It's about the self-deception that the wealthy engage in when they say ""Things like that don't happen in our neighborhood"". It's about the intrinsic instability that roils under the calm surface of the upper class, and how they really are like piranhas, tearing apart anything they see as prey - even if it is each other.

9. ""The Purge"" is a suspenseful and thoughtful morality tale that makes a depressing case about human nature. The more you think about it, the more impressive it is.",1405814400,12,2372,4.680288461538462
5584435,5,B00BEIYGXE,In the purge it's 2022 where all crime is legal for 12 hours now this movie is good it stars Ethan Hawke. and Lena headey it's about how they have there house all locked up until their son lets in a bum who some men are after in the movie now the blu ray only comes with a making of the film but the DVD is just a plain DVD so this movie is worth watching it's a good movie.,1405209600,,374,3.6875

5584448,2,B00BEIYGXE,"The Purge has an intriguing concept. The crime rate and unemployment are at an all time low and every year, America sections off one 12-hour interval known as 'The Purge' in which every law is temporarily suspended. More times than not, people use this time to feed their blood lust. In one very short segment, we are told that besides 'the purge' being an excuse for Americans to seriously indulge themselves, it also results in the deaths of many homeless people who are seen as drains on America's economy. Unfortunately, besides the interesting premise, The Purge is an utterly unimaginative and ridiculous home invasion movie. Its biggest misstep is failing to go deeper into the political themes, which are almost unbelievably shallow. Every time the film tricks the audience into thinking it might actually have something important to say, it takes a step back and someone gets offed in the most predictable way imaginable. The acting and directing are equally uninspired. Such a shame. It's very possible that if it had been more fleshed out and it was directed by someone with a dark visual flair (David Fincher), or maybe a sense of humor (Tim Burton), The Purge could have been something great.",1402358400,,1205,4.940886699507389
5584449,5,B00BEIYGXE,"I only watched this on pay-per-view as an alternative to whatever else was on TV. I thought I would half-watch it and do something else at the same time. Much to my surprise, I found this movie gripping and truly frightening. I was glued to my seat,

We all knew the premise from the promotional trailers. One night each year, board up your windows while your neighbors go crazy and turn murderous. Of course, something goes wrong and then another, until the nuclear family in the house is imprisoned by the insanity outside.

At barely 90 minutes this is not a long movie. If it were, you would probably lose interest. As it is, it is more like an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. There seem to be quite a few references to old movies but they fly by so quickly that they are difficult to remember. The house has retractable steel shutters (Forbidden Planet). The boy has a mutillated toy robot that brings BLADE RUNNER to mind. The acting is uniformly excellent.  the pacing is gripping and the direction is taut. It's great escapist entertainment.",1402272000,,1047,4.618279569892473
5584450,5,B00BEIYGXE,this is a pretty good movie. it has a lot of insight into the new world. I wonder if America will turn out like that. and I like how they set the date to 2022 that's not far away. I thought the story was good and the acting was pretty good to.  it probably won't happen. you can't control people. there will always be unemployment and crime. I did like how in the beginning of the movie that it said now politicians shale not be hurt. cause you know they will be the first ones people will go after. and I kind of think it's weird on how in the movie they make this one night like a holiday. all in all I thought this movie was good if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1400889600,,688,3.914285714285714

5584453,2,B00BEIYGXE,"For a while, as I was settling in for this movie, I was admittedly intrigued by the idea of a one-night of violence premise of this story.  I quickly realized however that the victims are likely to be the less fortunate, while the 1 percenters are safely holed up in their protected mansions.  Director and writer James DeMonaco would seem to have his primary characters laughing at those who can't afford the latest technology and who go about their business right up to the last second unconcerned they might be victims.

Ethan Hawke stars as James Sandin, a security salesman, who has done pretty well for himself and his beautiful wife Mary (Lena Headey) and teenaged children Zoey (Adelaid Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder).  They support the Purge as it has proven to bring down crime and only lasts for 12 hours once a year.  Rather than bring more depth to this idea, DeMonaco dives right into a traditional ""home invasion"" movie.  One we've seen often, usually a handful of times each year it would seem.

This one makes little sense either, as Charlie allows a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) into the house as he is being tracked down by a mob of, what appears to be, college students on a scavenger hunt.  The film becomes dumber by the minute as each scene becomes more and more predictable.  And in an effort to throw a twist at the end, throws and even more ridiculous final scene instead.  This film is just plain dumb.

As bad as the film is, the Blu ray transfer is very good.  Granted the film is very dark most of the time.  It takes place inside a house at night.  Then the power is cut off so what we get is emergency low light conditions and it works pretty well.  Skin tones look authentic and colors are pretty much limited to black and blue.  Resolution comes at 1080p and the aspect ratio is 2.40:1.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is excellent.  The surrounds are often in play as is the LFE directed at the sub.  Very clear, very good.  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish and English SDH.  The only extra is a 9 minute ""making of"" piece.",1395014400,3,2083,4.486702127659575

5584468,1,B00BEIYGXE,"Simple really.  Good story, really bad acting, editing and director.

The premise of the this film is really cool. One night a year, we as Americans, get to rid our society of people we just don't like and we get away with murder, literally.

There are a couple of mentions of the Founding Fathers, which gives you a feeling that this America took a turn towards a new government in the very near future.

The whole thing was poorly done, with bad acting from every actor, the bad editing with the ""jumpers"" throughout the film, and the director not helping with any real ""feeling"" between the actors themselves, and allowing the audience to entertained.

It felt more as all the actors were filming their own scenes separately, away from the other actors, then it was pasted together.  The acting was horrible to the point where you wanted them to just hurry up with the scene and get to the end.  The only actor to give me a vested interest into the film was Rhys Wakefield, who did do a good job as the protagonist.  Other than that, he was the only reason I didn't turn it off.

Ethan, I hope you don't make any more films like this.  If you re-make this, then please direct it. I like the story, but this one should be Purged out.

5584471,3,B00BEIYGXE,"In 2022, the government reserves one night a year where almost all crime is completely legal. That's 12 hours of complete freedom to rape, murder, steal, etc. The rest of the days of the year, the society is damn near utopic with extremely low crime and unemployment rates. James Sandin devoted to his family and has made a sizable fortune selling security systems specifically to keep families safe from the Purge. He and his family always hole up for the night and wait for it to be over, but this year is different. His son takes pity on a homeless man and allows him into their house. Some random hooligans were hunting him and now demand him back or they will kill the family instead. James has to decide which is more important, the life of a stranger or the lives of his family.

I love the concept for The Purge. There are New Founding Fathers who have enacted this policy in order to allow for a practically crime and unemployment free America. I really wanted to know more about these powerful men, how they came to me known as such, and what state of events led to the legalizing of one night of legalized crime. The aim of it seems to be to let people let off steam and to rid the streets of undesirables (the poor, homeless, and nonwhite) at the same time. The quality of life of the people improves without the government having to actually do anything productive like providing more jobs or funding public programs to help the needy. They just get rid of the class of people that actually needs help. Unfortunately, none of these concepts are really explored in depth and, beyond a few small things, the film is largely a typical home invasion film that offers nothing new to the genre.

There are a couple things in the film that comment on society and brought some intrigue to the film. James Sandin is a capitalist through and through, the top seller of security at his work  Unfortunately, the security quality is quite low and doesn't actually withstand a lot of abuse despite its high price tag. The libertarian policies of his company bite him in the ass and leads to his own home being vulnerable to attack. He knew the security was crap and that didn't stop him from selling to hundreds of people and installing it in his own home. Who knows how many other people died as a result of the shoddy workmanship and corporate greed. The homeless man is the only person who is poor and not privileged in the film. He is treated as an animal and a possession by those more affluent. It might have been more interesting to have the story center around more than one person who would actually be affected by the Purge rather than a rich white family that acts supremely stupid at every turn.

The rest of the the film is your standard home invasion film. The attackers have creepy masks (a la The Strangers) and terrorize the family. They were actually pretty decent at being deranged. The family run around like chickens with their heads cut off and make the dumbest decisions on the face of the planet throughout the film. It would have been nice for them to make a decision about the homeless guy and stick with it instead of flip flopping every two seconds. I didn't really feel any sympathy for the family because they directly benefited from scamming people and the Purge plus they were boring. They were frankly getting what was coming to them.

The ending had some humor to it, but the film was overall a disappointment. The backstory was so interesting yet completely ignored after it generally set up the rules of the world. I would like to see a sequel or prequel that delves into the history behind it and focuses on the people who are actually victimized during the Purge.",1389398400,,3700,4.532934131736527
5584472,2,B00BEIYGXE,Did not live up to the hype whatsoever. how can you have such a good idea for something that is happening all around the Nation and only focus on ONE house/neighborhood the entire movie.

5584473,2,B00BEIYGXE,"The dystopia that the makers of this film created could only have arisen out of leftist fantasies.  Set a few election cycles down the road, the ""new founding fathers"" decree that one night per year all sorts of violent crime should be permitted.

But what about Congress and the Supreme Court?  Imagine that the Constitution was suspended for one night, so laws on the books don't apply.  No Conservative Constitutionally oriented government would do that even if they could, but a leftist one might.  We've already seen that happen with arbitrary Executive rule changing in Obamacare, non-enforcement of immigration laws, etc.

And where are the states?  It's clear from the film that the Federal government is behind this, yet it's states that make and enforce laws about violent acts.  Unless all we have is one big Federal government lording it over all of us.  Just another leftist fantasy.  Or goal, if you like.

Other themes are hinted at, like class warfare, ""getting even"", and (inexplicably) why the economy has recovered from the worst collapse ever.  I'd like to know how they did the latter.  It sure wasn't with one night of violence.  Chicago and Detroit go through that every night and it hasn't helped.  Anyway the class warfare and getting even part are reliably leftist.

One other thing.  Who lets psychopaths like that preppie maniac in the film wander the streets?  In the real world you can find any number of leftie judges and professorial expert witnesses to set them free.

All this is just a personal point of view.  It's what occurred to me after watching this and noticing cues like ""Blessed be"" and ""Thee"", which I suppose are the filmmakers' idea of how religion spouting right wing radicals talk.  In the real world I often see people like this in the Whole Foods parking lot, although they don't talk that way.

Instead, they often have Obama/Biden stickers on their car bumpers.",1386115200,3,1914,4.860681114551084

If you don't like it, come up with a better script and 3 mil, and film it yourself, I say. Fact is, this filmmaker thought it up himself, so he gets to run with it his way.  His way is certainly filled with twists, sometimes seemingly just for twist sake, and I personally would have gone a dozen different directions with it, but that's the thing- I didn't think of any of it until this movie proposed the idea to start with.  It is thought provoking, unpredictable (anyone can die or kill, there are no rules) , a little thin and short (probably thin budget related). I did not expect literal class warfare to be as central a theme as it is. I found it scary at times, most effective in the dark and the creepy masks but especially in the ""all bets are off"" sense even Suzy suburban homemaker is allowed even encouraged to be a mindless killer for 12 hrs.

5584535,1,B00BEIYGXE,"I'm sorry, this is one of the dumbest movies I've even seen, and that's saying something.  The plot (and I hate using that word) is simple. For 12 hours all crime is legal, all of them, nothing is off limits. Due to some things that happened, a gang targets a family. That's all I want to say about it.  I want to say again, what a stupid movie this is.

First off, the characters, all of them are annoying. Think of the most stupid thing a character could do in a movie, and they do it.  Let a stranger in a house? Yup. Hide in stupid places? You got it.  Search their house alone looking for someone? Why we have that too.  This was so stupid, I'm surprised that someone didn't take a bath or go investigate a strange noise, or say ""I'll be right back.""  Idiots.

****SPOILERS*****

The kid was most annoying. To start us off, this lil  twit lets a stranger in the house!  This is the event that starts everything off.  He's such a dingbat. His dad told him to go in in the basement and hide That's all this lil nimrod had to do. If he did that everything would be fine. What does this numb nuts do? He goes in the dark basement to hide....in the dark....and turns on a bright *bleeping* flashlight! I'm sorry, but I was rooting for the killers at this point.  Then the father isn't much better. This genius knows a stranger is in the house, and the daughter's missing in the house, and he goes into a 5 minute speech on how he's going to go look for the stranger. Never mind the speech, just go look for your daughter!  Then the father is a security expert...but doesn't have a Safety Room in the house.  No wonder the kid's a dingbat with a father like that. All of the characters were idiots.  What's with the shaky camera effect and the low camera angles? If you have a good story, you don't need that garbage. That's the sign of a hack movie maker.  Don't even get me started on the stupid walking edits. Then when the bad guys were trashing the house, the director decided to instill  no sound at all.  Again,  the director is a hack of a movie maker. Nothing but a rank amateur.

*****SPOILERS END****

5584537,3,B00BEIYGXE,"This movie has a very interesting premise and good actors playing characters that are fun to watch. However while development, personalities and mindsets are given to all characters at the start of the movie, it ends up not mattering later in the movie as it turns into a survival movie. Now, that's not always a bad thing, as survival movies can be quite engaging without much development (Frozon for one) but, it was a bummer here that the characters ended up falling flat as you would think in the first act that the family is struggling (it's not much of a spoiler to let you know that they aren't).

Now don't get me wrong I thought the movie got intense as it went on, I was impressed with how each character behaved, enjoyed the fight scenes and found most situations to be understandable but, the most important scene involving the family feels rushed and non identifiable. If that scene was more believeable then I might be able to give the movie 4 stars, but with one of the most important scenes of the movie done in an imperfect way it gets three.

However I've heard that there are plans for a sequel. That would be interesting, if done differently, because while it would be interesting to see another family/person in a different situation, it wouldn't be a good way to continue this idea unless they just happen to make an unexpected gem.",1382486400,,1354,4.590909090909091

  It is the year 2022.  A law has been passed which implements the Purge.  For one day only, from 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M., all violent crime, including murder, is legal.  (Politicians, of course, are exempt; they always are from radical laws.)  James Sandin (Ethan Hawke, ""Sinister"") has become rich selling high tech home security systems to his neighbors.  He and his wife, Mary (Lena Headey, ""Laid to Rest""), support the Purge; their children, ironically, question its morality, especially the youngest child, their precocious, nerdy son, Charlie [Max Burkholder, ""Children of the Corn"" (2009)].  This year, the Sandins are plunged into a twelve hour nightmare of blood and betrayal when a homeless war vet---pursued by a group of murderous yuppies---seeks refuge inside their mansion.

  James DeMonaco's ""The Purge"" is a clever morality play that reminded me of an episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""  I had to watch this provocative thriller twice before penning my review.  My girlfriend, Tammy, who gave it to me as an early Halloween present, was pleasantly surprised by my fascination with it.  She and I watched the film together and thoroughly enjoyed it for its gruesome violence, unsuspecting twists, and thought-provoking commentary on our country's violent culture where capital punishment, euthanasia, and abortion are legal.  Many of us, including myself, are not concerned about these highly controversial issues as long as they don't harm us.  However, our moral values quickly change when we are the victims.  The Sandin family rethinks their support of the controversial Purge when they become the targets in lieu of the homeless, the poor, and the unwanted who are the intended targets.

  At first glance, potential viewers would think that the Purge would never happen in this country.  We are too civilized for that.  Millions thought abortion would never be legalized.  Who would have thought Hitler would sanction the murder of over six million Jews?  What kind of culture brought the Nazi Regime into existence?  In ""The Purge,"" the ""freaks"" who attack the Sandins wear masks.  Many of us wear masks throughout our lives.  We smile on the outside while hate, envy, bitterness and other sins eat away at us from the inside.  There are other methods of purging ourselves of these feeling without committing violent acts.  This is what distinguishes us from the animals--our ability to make choices.  On Purge night, we revert to our basic animal nature.  If given the opportunity, how many of us would participate in the Purge?  Everyone has that neighbor, coworker, or relative they have fantasized about killing.  For one night a year, the Purge allows us to turn our fantasies of killing into horrid reality.

  The only bonus feature that the Blu-ray has, other than English subtitles and a widescreen presentation, is a ""making of"" featurette titled ""Surviving the Night.""  Approximately eight to nine minutes in length, it provides interesting commentary from various members of the cast and crew.  Basically, the actors describe the film's horrifying content and the director describes his intention of making it provocative.  [There are also movie trailers galore for recently released new and classic thrillers from Universal Studios such as ""Contraband,"" starring Mark Wahlberg, and ""Scarface"" (Al Pacino)].  Overall, ""The Purge"" is a must see for fans of provocative, futuristic horror involving desperate societies whose morals have become twisted such as ""Logan's Run"" (Michael York) and ""Soylent Green"" (Charlton Heston).  Watch it with a group of friends and conduct a roundtable; it makes a great topic for discussion.

This movie had so many points in which the characters are dumber than the screenwriter. No person in their right mind would do half the s*** the characters did in this film. Lets not forget to mention the OVERUSED and very abused off camera surprise save of a character by someone shooting the bad guys just in the nic of time with a raid of bullets.

5584632,4,B00BEIYGXE,"What if, for one night each year, you could commit any crime without fear of reprisal? What would you do? Commit robbery? Extortion? Rape? How about murder?

This is America circa 2022---wracked with overpopulation, high unemployment and brutal crime. In an effort to save the country, the U.S. government sanctions ""The Purge,"" an annual 12-hour period where any and all criminal acts become legal, unpunishable by the law. And you know what? It works. As a direct result of this purge, crime rates are down and unemployment falls below 1%. But not everyone chooses to participate in this violent free-for-all. When an unexpected encounter with a stranger threatens the safety of the Sandin family, James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) must decide if violence really is the way or be forced to face the deadly consequences.

If I had to formulate a list of the most disturbing films ever, The Purge would be near the top. In fact, The Purge is somewhat reminiscant of Stephen King's The Mist in that it explores the darker side of the human condition and poses some seriously disturbing questions. And like The Mist, the answers we find are profoundly unsettling. Surprisingly, it's not the violence that makes this movie an uneasy one to watch. Was it there? Sure. But it's no more violent than other movies I've seen recently. Instead, it's the opportunity for violence and the unpredictability of man that keeps it so uncertain and edgy. You're left looking to your neighbor and wondering, given the same situation, what would they do?

Watching The Purge was an experience in and of itself. It's gripping, intense and the second-by-second tension kept me on the edge of my seat (quite literally!). My anxiety levels were through the roof and I'm talking that nails-digging-into-my-palms kind of intense. The action steadily builds into a frighteningly violent crescendo. The movie's pacing is quick and the height of the action is much shorter than one would initially expect, however, it'es nough to get the point across effectively. Any longer and they would've gone overboard. And let me just say, I'm super glad they didn't take that route because, honestly, I'm not sure I could've handled much more. Creepy as it was overall, the film gets somewhat campy towards the finale which left many a viewer displeased. But I thought it was a rather brilliant way to end such an intense movie and was relieved to find those cheesy, albeit brief, moments..

As for the characters, some are hollow but I didn't mind because the people who really mattered were top-notch. Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke shone in their respective roles as Mrs. and Mr. Sandin, but Rhys Wakefield as the villainous leader (credited as ""polite stranger"") was the one who really stole the show. Like in most movies, you expect the villain to be psychotic---savage in appearance, crazy in demeanor, poor in intellect and speech. Wakefield was anything but. He's well-groomed, rich and seemingly well-educated making his detached savagery all the more brutal and unexpected. Some of the characters, the children namely, are familiar cliches and a bit of the dialogue borders on silly, but I found them easily overlooked when compared to the bigger picture.

Though I thought The Purge was commendable, due to its profoundly disturbing nature, I don't feel right giving it any sort of starred rating. And though it's not particularly scary, it's a gripping and effective thriller. It'll leave you thinking and wondering and fearfully hoping that this isn't what the world is coming to. This movie explores several philosophical musings such as are we a violent species by nature and are humans inherently evil? The answers aren't easy ones to come by and the social commentary is somewhat depressing. It's also one of those rare movies that isn't for the faint of heart. And while I'm really glad I watched it, I'll probably never own or view it again. I'm a huge fan of horror and it takes a lot to leave me reeling, and this movie, it definitely achieved that.",1372636800,4,4040,4.944035346097202
5584633,3,B00BEIYGXE,"The concept of having one night to purge, or cleanse yourself of your demons is a clever one. But would it really reduce crime, and make the nation a better, safer place. Or boost the economy? Certainly not. Even with or without consequences people would still kill just as they do in real life. This would actually probably make them want to do it even more often. The movie itself was done by the producers of Sinister (which i thought was brilliant), and Paranormal Activity, (which only 2 were good). So i was expecting just a little more in the way of surprises, twists and turns. Unfortunately this movie has none of that. It's really an idea, more so than a movie. There is no ""real"" story.

What you see in the previews is what you see in the film, which happens with many films. But more so with this one. It does have some great scares, tense moments and Ethan Hawke is once again at the top of his game. After seeing him in Sinister i really wanted to see him in another horror/murder type flick. Awesome job. As for the rest of the cast they were good as well, the demented people wearing masks is classic of such films as Insidious, Saw, and many other horror/murder films. And it works really well, just not as well as most would like. So the question it, is it worth watching? Yes very much so. As i said it's a concept rather than a deep movie with an actual plot. And afterwards it does make you think what you would do if there were no consequences for your actions. Even if it was just one night. What would you do? Well this movie gives no answers, so it's really up to you. It is good for what it is. But as I said lacks any real meaningful insight for what it's worth. The only thing I didn't really like, was the ending. That can make or break a film. With this one, it just leaves you pondering.",1372118400,3,1819,4.257225433526012

Many horror films like The Strangers, recycle common elements, but bring a unique brand of style to their respective genres, but even on that level The Purge falls flat.  During the finale the same shot repeats several times, where one of the masked perpetrators stands over a protagonist ready to kill, and then is shot from off screen.

5584635,4,B00BEIYGXE,"Let me start out by being perfectly clear. When I saw the first trailer for The Purge, I thought to myself, that is going to be a great horror movie. I just got finished watching The Purge. Is it great like I hoped? Sadly no it is not and on any other given Sunday, I would call this movie god awful. But there is something admirable and admittedly a little thought provoking about this movie that made me enjoy it.

The Purge stars Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey as James and Mary Sandin. Another thing that sparked my interest with this movie was the two lead actors Ethan Hawke who already starred in another horror film Sinister, and Lena Headey from the brilliant show Game of Thrones and the movie 300. I would say the acting in this movie is not the best, but then again not very many horror movies are known for giving Oscar worthy performances. In the Purge, it is the year 2022 where on one specific night for 12 hours crime is legal. That's right CRIME. 12 hours may not seem like a very long time, but trust me IT IS. I would note that one of the pros this movie has is that the story, while it is predictable at times, does keep you guessing and keeps your attention for the entire movie.

Now my problem with The Purge is this: for what the premise suggests and the rating it has, you would initially consider this to be an all out horror film. As a matter of fact, I would consider it more of psychiatric thriller or something of that nature. In my honest opinion, The Purge is not very scary at all. Be mindful, there is a lot of violence and chaos going on, but this is not a film that would scare you sleepless in my opinion. Another problem is that there are some things that don't make a whole lot of sense in the movie, but strangely enough, I was able to overlook it.

After watching The Purge, I said to myself "" I am supposed to dislike this movie'' ""why in the world do i like this movie so much?'' To be perfectly honest, some might think I am in need of a brain exam for liking this movie. But I do admire the way The Purge tries to be creative and clever (although its not very clever). And I especially admired the overall tone of the movie. It is nowhere near perfect, The Purge is not, but as a movie, it gets

5584726,5,B00BEIYGXE,I ABSOULATELY LOVED THE FILM! SO SUSPENSFUL. I LOVED THAT THE 1ST HALF WAS PURE MASTERPIECE & THE SECOND WAS PURE HORROR. I LOVED THAT IT SHOWED THE PURGE HAPPENING FROM A FAMILIES POINT OF VIEW.,1371859200,4,195,4.444444444444445
5584727,1,B00BEIYGXE,"The idea of the Purge is pretty original and neat. While it's not exactly practical it's an interesting idea that can touch upon a lot of different ideas like how far are you willing to go for the greater good and such. And while these questions were raised during the movie, the actual story was dumber than a bag of rocks. With all this potential, in all these different directions the story could've gone, it chooses home invasion. A pretty unremarkable one at that.

Ethan Hawke and his family are rich and therefore have a home security system, so they lock themselves in and get ready to enjoy the night in comfy safety. However a bunch of things go wrong, and all of the potential suspense is quickly dissipated due to dumb decisions made by impulsive characters. The first thing that happens is the son sees a guy outside begging for help, so he unlocks the security and le-wait. Wait. How does the young son know the passcode to the security? Why would he know? *Sigh* buckle up because we're taking the Plothole Express to Stupidsville. So the son knows the passcode and lets the stranger into the house. Then a group of vigilantes come by and want the family to release the stranger so they can kill him.

This is where it just gets worse. The message of morality is smacked in your face, and it's a flawed message at that. 'Even though this purge is helping America in the long run, how morally bankrupt have we become that we'll send an innocent man to the wolves?' That's what this movie tells you basically. But before we get all misty eyed and start applauding, let's think about a few things first. Would YOU risk your entire family's life for a total stranger? Your parents, your children, your brothers and sisters and husbands and wives, would you endanger them for a total stranger? Didn't think so. This stupid kid let the guy in, as far as I'm concerned the kid gets to be thrown out too for mindlessly risking his entire family's lives.

So then they finally find the guy hiding in their house and they subdue him. Before they do however the stranger keeps going ""I'm not gonna die tonight"" and the family (except the stupid son) are like ""get this guy outta here so we don't die"", but after they're tying the guy to a chair to get him out, everyone but the dad gets cold feet and starts going ""what have we become!?"" while the stranger goes ""let me die so your family can live"". Yes, everyone starts flip-flopping their morality for no reason at all. Also when they're trying to present the guy, the dad, who suddenly forgot everything going on, decides to take forever with throwing the stranger out there, then changes his mind (but still leaves the stranger tied up). What's the point here, one family can't stand to watch someone pull the trigger?

*Spoilers* So predictable mayhem ensues and the dad dies. Congratulations sonny, hope saving a random guy who you'll never see again was worth growing up a bastard for the rest of your life. I was hoping as the dad was dying he grabbed his son by the collar, got up to his face, and said ""you.. did... this.."" then dies, traumatizing that kid for life. Also the vigilantes outside consider themselves very intelligent people, yet for all their supposed intelligence they all completely spread apart and wander around the house by themselves, not being attracted to gunshots or fighting, or using their overwhelming numbers as an advantage. Same with the family, everyone splits apart, the kid is given a gun and a flashlight, and when dangers nearby, makes sure to shake his flashlight around because he wants everyone to know his location. The mom also wanders around her house the entire time with her arm completely stretched out holding a pistol. Because if someone's hiding in a room ready to attack, it's best to hold the gun as far away from you as possible. Then the neighbors hear the commotion and come to the rescue at the last minute, or so it seems. Instead they want to torture and kill the family, but not before reciting some stupid pointless ritual to drag out the scene, eventually getting saved by the stranger at the last minute(again). So what does the family do? They disarm their blood lusting neighbors and sit around with them awkwardly for the rest of the purge time. It's like all this crazy stuff happened and the only way to conclude it is by a scolding.

This movie starts with an interesting concept, shrinks down to a little home invasion story, then starts slapping you with it's heavy handed message. The story is propelled along by stupid, illogical, and impulsive decisions. The only good that can come out of this movie is if they actually expand on the idea and show more society on a bigger scale instead of just one family. Other than that, screw this movie.",1371859200,10,4776,4.614117647058824
5584728,2,B00BEIYGXE,"Some spoilers:  On a night where all crimes are legal so people can get out their aggression, a familie's lives are in danger when the dumb son feels sorry for a troubled homeless man and lets him in. Of course a group of psychos come knocking and want the man or they'll hurt the family. The dumb son still chooses to help the man over his family and again puts his family in danger. Then the whole family decides to be dumb and not hand the man over and of course, their night becomes even worse.
  A good idea is poorly executed when everyone in the movie makes horror movie mistakes and you always know when someone is going to jump out and attack or when someone is going to come to the rescue. There's just not enough surprises or scares. There is a little tension I admit and if it's your first horror movie ever, you might find it terrifying. I, however have seen enough to find it predictable and the main killer seeming to think he was Christian Bale in American Psycho was kind of annoying.",1371772800,3,1001,4.3138297872340425
5584729,2,B00BEIYGXE,"The Purge could have been a much better film.  I loved what the concept was.  What if murder was legal for one night in America?  Not a bad way to capture attention or to create debate.  What saddens me is that the plot of the film captures you, but, by the end, the writing of the script is so poor that it does not hold you.  When it is all done, you are left unsatisfied.

The problem is they focus on one family, when they could have focused on an entire society.  They simplified the film too much.  Was this because of a small budget?  Who knows?

Once it's over you don't feel much sympathy for the family's ordeal that night.  It's a family of four with a geeky dad, stupid wife, brain dead daughter and weird son.  You wind up becoming more annoyed with them than anything else.

As you are watching the film, some things just don't make any sense whatsoever.  I will only give one scene away in this film just as an example.  The daughter's boyfriend sneaks into the house.  He makes out with the daughter and then states he wants to go talk to the father about the fact that the father does not want him near his daughter.  It is because he feels he is too old for her.  He walks down the stairs, sees the father, and tries to shoot him.  The father shoots him instead.  He is seriously wounded and the DAUGHTER helps the guy back up the stairs and, as he is bleeding to death, she cries for him as she is holding him in her arms.  Does that make any sense to you?

The funny part of the film is how they get in trouble during the purge.  In fact, it is just as ludicrous as the scene I described above.  I am not going to give the scene away, but you will want to choke somebody.  It was so dumb what the youngest member of the family does.

Then there is a group of people that are going to attack the house.  This gang is going around town killing people.  For some reason, during this night of murder, none of them are wearing bulletproof vests.  In fact, one member of the gang is wearing a bathrobe.  Also, instead of guns, some members are just carrying axes and knives.  HUH?  People are killing people with guns around the country and you bring knives?  What sense does that make?

That, in the end, is the problem.  A lot of things in the film just do not make sense.  There is another reviewer who states that people were laughing in the theater.  I know that person is truthful, because the same thing happened in the theater where I saw this film.  You are not supposed to laugh throughout a movie that bills itself as a horror/suspense film.  That is exactly what happened.

I dare you to watch this film and try not to laugh.",1371772800,2,2651,4.203187250996016
5584730,5,B00BEIYGXE,"The Purge doesn't start at 7PM, it starts at Midnight. Goes til 7AM. It's seven hours long. If you had payed any attention at all you would've known that.
  This movie was pretty rad. One plot flaw? Their security systems in the movie are electrically run and so in order to arm and disarm it, you have to have electricity. Of course, the group of strangers cuts off all power to the house to intimidate the family, but then demand the stranger be put outside if they want to be left alone. They're not really given a choice.",1371340800,2,525,4.346938775510204
5584731,4,B00BEIYGXE,"The opening scenes introduce us to a dystopian futuristic America in which we have overcome staggering recessions, unemployment and crime rates.  Everyone seems happy and at peace with the means that provide this thriving economy.

So what do they have to thank?  The Purge.  The Purge is a 12-hour period during which all crime is legal and all police, medical and emergency services are suspended.  Radio and news casts bombard viewers with soma-popping Brave New World mantras about ""unleashing the beast within"" to ""cleanse [or purge] our inherently violent nature.""

What's most interesting about this society is that The Purge is embraced by most everyone.  Sure, there are media debates on how The Purge ""targets"" the poor who can't afford to defend themselves, but even the wealthy--with their armored home security systems--socialize, talk about what they're doing during The Purge or ""purge"" together in hunting parties.

All of the pro-Purge political views are presented through an upper class filter--more specifically, the pro-Purge mindset of James Sandin (Ethan Hawke; Sinister, Daybreakers), a home security system salesman who lives in a ritzy neighborhood full of fake, well-to-do smiling neighbors.  This year, instead of attending a party, James is spending a quiet purge with his wife Mary (Lena Headey; Game of Thrones, Dredd, The Cave, The Brothers Grimm), son Charlie (Max Burkholder) and daughter Zooey (Adelaide Kane).

James' family is less embracing of The Purge than the rest of the neighborhood but, for fear of death, they abide by the social standard but do not themselves partake.  Catching more of our attention is James.  His security system sales are booming, he's boat shopping and he talks a big game about supporting The Purge but when he justifies its value or explains to his son why he has never felt the urge to purge there is more than a dash of a hesitation in his tone.

Things begin to go wrong for the Sandins when Max sympathizes with an injured man.  He hears his cries for help on the surveillance system and disarms the security for long enough to let the man into the house for safety.  Shortly thereafter, a group of over-educated young adults led by polite stranger with an intensely striking sense of rich kid entitlement demand that the Sandins release the injured victim into their lethal care as a Purge tribute.  If the Sandins don't, the strangers threaten to penetrate the security system and kill everyone.  That's what you get from the preview and I won't give you any more except to say that things get interesting, intense, gory, fun (for violent film fans) and equal parts predictable and unpredictable.

I thought all of the actors did a fine job.  Solid performances across the board!  Some may consider the polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield) to be pretty hammed up, but I thought his supervillainous, sociopathic and zealous mentality helped separate this strong film from the likes of The Strangers, which carried no social commentary or message whatsoever.  As extreme as the premise may seem in The Purge, I must admit that it got me thinking.  Not necessarily ""agreeing,"" but thinking.

I went into this movie excited because of the preview, but nervous as to how it would play out.  In the end I feel that all of my positive expectations were met and none of the bad came to fruition.  I was very pleased.",1371254400,50,3379,4.969750889679715
5584732,5,B00BEIYGXE,"(Some spoilers follow)
What if scenarios are great aren't they? One what if scenario that is an interesting topic of discussion is what if violence was allowed to take place without any repercussions?

""The Purge"" takes that topic and we see the consequences. Ethan Hawke plays James Sandin, a man who essentially gets paid for selling security systems. He of course has his own top notch security system in place. Lena Headey plays his peaceful housewife Mary while Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder play the kids.

The topic of what would happen if one day a state took the day off from regulating laws, and lets  its people become as violent as they want to be is an interesting topic for sure.  Of course, we know the consequences would be disastrous.  Without laws governing our behavior, a lot of people's fantasies and urges would take a deadly turn.  The movie does a pretty good job of showing that side of the story.

In the beginning, Sandin and his family are pretty supportive of the process (as long as long they don't have to get their own hands dirty, and it doesn't affect them who cares right?) Then when they become the victims of the very thing they support they do a complete 360. What a surprise huh? (sarcasm)

However, director  James Demonaco doesn't stop the theme of the movie to be just about the consequences of a lawless society, no he throws a lot of other themes in there. For instance, underneath the whole attack on the Sandin family for harboring a homeless man there is a subtext here for class warfare and prejudice.  The ""purgers"" keep referring to the homeless man as a ""homeless pig"" someone whose essentially (in their eyes)an undesirable entity that must be rubbed out just because he is not part of the rich elite class that James Sandin represents.

I liked the character development though there could have been a bit more. Sure the Sandins are only concerned for the well being once the violence erupts, but they have their moment of enlightenment, and we all know that things will change from then on.

Of course the movie isn't perfect and has a few flaws , but overall it's pretty entertaining. Again, imo puts out the themes out there without being overly preachy.",1371254400,5,2213,4.675257731958763

5584734,3,B00BEIYGXE,"A friend and myself went to see this film, expecting it to be somewhere along the lines of suspenceful and scary (somewhere between the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" series). It was neither. If anything, it was comical with some awkwardly timed dialogue. There was at least two times when the entire theater roared in laughter at a few terribly placed lines. It also appeared to have a lot of newer actors and thespians; at least, ones I was unfamiliar with. They did a fantastic job.

Overall, it was decent enough to not go demanding your money back, but honestly not worth purchasing on DVD.",1370995200,2,598,4.588785046728972
