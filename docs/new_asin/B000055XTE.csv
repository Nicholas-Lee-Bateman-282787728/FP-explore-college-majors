1394286,5,B000055XTE,"I love this DVD! The picture is not so great, but I don't care, the remastered sound is sooo much better than the VHS or when PBS shows this footage. Sutherland is amazing! Farrell's artistry is unsurpassed! Leontyne and Tebaldi are beautiful! Even Corelli does some of his best vocal moments. The only disappointment for me was Regine Crespin and that Rise Stevens didn't do a selection from Carmen, because she is one of my  favorite mezzos along with Tatiana Troyanos (who is not on this DVD). Did I mention Birgit Nilsson? She makes it all look so easy, including a fabulous high C!  I would buy this DVD just for Farrell and Sutherland! This is a great find! Most of the singers are in their prime. This is one of those worthy investments or splurges, however you like to think of it!!",993254400,23,790,4.5174825174825175
1394287,4,B000055XTE,"This 2-hour collection of scenes form the very fine Bell Telephone Hour Broadcasts contains enough evidence of a decade of historically superb operatic performance. I lament the lack of singing of this quality today!
If for no other reason, a video documentary of Sutherland's Mad Scene from Lucia from early in her career (1961-the year of her Met debut) is enough reason to buy this DVD. The only early video document of her immortal interpretation of this role is a valuable asset-the only other performances are from late in her career. Two scenes from Madame Butterfly with Renata Tebaldi in quite fine voice add to the value of this collection. Follow this up with the rarely documented performance of ""Liebestod"" from Eileen Farrell and what more can you ask for? Farrell is amazing-magnetic! Her extraordinarily eyes and magnificent voice draw you completely into the scene. This is the earliest clip (1959) and is a beautiful document of this highly underrated and magnificent singer.
On technical merits, one has to balance the sound and video quality with the source. Compared to the VHS releases of some of these clips (there is some duplication from earlier VHS release, but also a lot that was never released before), the sound and picture are incredibly improved. However, they don't compare to modern sound and video. So what! TV sound was in its infancy as far as broadcasting orchestra and opera. There aren't any performers today to compare to these legends. I agree with another reviewer on the weak performances of Merrill and Stevens, but with the likes of Corelli singing Tosca, there is so much more good than ordinary. If only there were still such programming available today.
I can look past the 1960s sets and costuming and can understand the limitations of early TV sound to see the value in this collection. I don't think my collection would be complete without this DVD.",990748800,18,1901,4.94375
1394288,1,B000055XTE,With such a star studded line up i had great hopes for this dvd. In truth the only tracks that had acceptable sound quality were those of leontyne price. Most of the stars assembled here were stars because of the exceptional quality of their voices rather than for their acting. This dvd does not do justice to the quality of their voices and losses by this failure. I would not recommend this dvd even for nostalgia.,983664000,6,417,4.5
1394289,2,B000055XTE,"This DVD contains great performances, however the picture qulaity is so poor that you have the feeling you are wathcing a weak TV broadcast with a broken set of rabbit ears.",982368000,5,173,4.612903225806452
1394290,5,B000055XTE,"Here are two hours of treasures from the Bell Telephone Hour, aired from 1959 to 1966.  These are complete scenes and arias, most staged with costumes and sets typical of 60's television.  It contains a dazzling array of opera superstars, many performing scenes from their signature roles:  Tebaldi (Butterfly), de los Angeles (Boheme), Richard Tucker (Pagliacci), Corelli and Crespin (Tosca and Ballo), Di Stefano (Manon), Simionato and Vickers (Aida), London (Boris Godunov), and Moffo and Gedda (Traviata).
Joan Sutherland gives a stunning performance of the mad scene from Lucia from the year of her Met debut.  The scene is complete from Lucia's entrance to her death, and if there were nothing else on this DVD, this alone would be reason enough to run right out and buy it.  Leontyne Price brings her rich, dark voice to D'amor sull'ali rosee (Trovatore) and Ritorna vincitor (Aida), reminding us why she owned these roles thoughout her career.  Birgit Nilsson shines In questa reggia (Turandot) and the immolation scene (Gotterdammerung).  What a thrill to see Sutherland, Price, and Nilsson in their prime, singing roles for which they set the standard.  And what a thrill to see the under-recorded Eileen Farrell singing Isolde's Liebestod, though whoever thought to dress her somewhat like a nun in a pillbox hat and veil should be dealt with severely.
On the down side, some of the acting is of the silent movie variety, but that is easily forgiven given the quality of singing.  Robert Merrill and Roberta Peters mar otherwise fine vocalism (Dunque io son from The Barber of Seville) with some pretty competitive mugging, playing more to the camera than to each other.  And Rise Stevens sings a rather dull and very long scene from Victor Herbert's Natoma.  Still there is a lot to love here.  If this DVD is your cup of tea, take a look at Great Moments in Opera from the Ed Sullivan Show too.",980899200,34,1907,4.925

7931201,5,B000055XTE,"These performances somehow survived.  They are all in color.  They date from 1959  1966.  The visual images are actually quite good considering the source material.  The sound has a very limited frequency range (sort of like a good telephone) but there is no static and the voices are clear.  I remember watching TV from this period.  The DVD has better quality than what I can remember being broadcast.  There are about 17 performances.  Many of these are sung by people with very little other video presence.  There are no subtitles, but each aria has an intro by the announcer.  If you like opera, you will most likely like this DVD.",1345507200,,636,4.6909090909090905
7931202,5,B000055XTE,"""The Bell Telephone Hour"" ran from 1959 through 1968.  I remember watching many of the programs in that time.  A number of these featured operatic performance, some of which are captured on this DVD.  As a result, this work is a nice historical time capsule of some of the best singers of that era. As a side note, it is interesting to observe that this was one of the first TV programs to feature color.

Here follow some exemplar cuts:

Renata Tebaldi sings ""Un Bel Di,"" from Puccini's ""Madame Butterfly.""  What a lush voice!  This is one of the great sopranos of the 20th century.  Clothed in appropriate garb, she does considerable justice to this aria.  She also demonstrates a compelling portrait of her character.

Robert Merrill, the wonderful baritone, takes on ""Largo al Factotum"" from Rossini's ""Il Barbiere di Siviglia."" He has great fun with this well known piece.  He sings it at the usual breakneck pace and shows great facility and agility with his singing.  This is a most entertaining version.

Nicolai Gedda and Anna Moffo are featured in a cut from ""La Traviata,"" the drinking song, ""Libiamo."" Gedda's wonderfully mannered voice is well displayed, as is Moffo's rich soprano voice.  The two voices intertwine nicely.  This is a very satisfying duet.

Leontyne Price demonstrates why she was so well acclaimed, with her version of Verdi's ""D'Amour sull'ali Rosee.""  She displays a nicely textured soprano.  She creates a character through her singing.  This performance illustrates why she was so highly regarded.

Victoria de los Angeles sings a splendid version of ""Si, Mi Chiamano Mimi,"" from Puccini's ""La Boheme.""  Sweetly sung.  She was a soprano with impeccable technique and taste, illustrated nicely here.

Franco Corelli and his wonderful instrument take on ""E Lucevan le Stelle"" from ""Tosca.""  And what a magnificent instrument! He was one of the finer tenors of the 20th century.  The final ""la vita"" is most poignantly sung.

Birgit Nilsson sings a far too attenuated piece of Brunnhilde's ""Immolation Scene"" (just a couple minutes"" from Wagner's ""Gotterdammerung"").  What little there is is well sung by one of the best Wagnerian sopranos of her time.

Finally, a real treat.  Joan Sutherland's ""Mad Scene"" from ""Lucia di Lammermoor.""  This is a singer and a part that appear made for one another.  From beginning to end, Sutherland sparkles here.  Her version of the cabaletta, ""Spargi d'amaro pianto"" is iconic.  It is all here in this 1962 performance.  She shows off her wonderful coloratura technique.  Trills, staccato singing, other ornamentation, and a final high note all work well.  Dame Joan in her prime. . . .

In short, a great DVD in terms of portraying top singers of the 1950s and 1960s in the operatic repertoire.",1192665600,2,2764,4.982456140350878
7931203,4,B000055XTE,"Allow me to get my 2 negative comments out of the way. 1. The disappointing visual transfer to dvd format. 2. The hatchet job done on the 20 minute finale of Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It was condensed into a 2 minute snip-it. As a devoute of the great Birgit Nilson,I was teed off to say the least. That said,on to the kudos.
  The roster of artists is an impressive one. The vocal selections are some of the greatest ever written. I have a newfound respect for 2 singers I previously thought overrated, Franco Correlli & Renata Tebaldi. I found each vocally thrilling!
  The vocal phenomenon Leontyne Price did not disappoint. Her throne is a secure one. Her vocal superiority will never be surpassed. She is particularly radiant in the Aida segment.
  I feel fortunate to own this epitaph to the amazing artistry of these great singers. I can't wait to order the Vol. 2!",1077321600,7,872,4.666666666666667
7931204,5,B000055XTE,"This is the one to get if you're on a budget and want to see and hear the greatest singers of the 20th century in their glorious prime. We all have our favorites. But you can't mention divas without mentioning Price, Nilsson, Tebaldi, and Sutherland. All in top form. It was a real treat to see Price sing her Verdi arias so gloriously. She was certainly one of my favorite divas of all time. But then I also think Tebaldi is a contender for the voice of the century. Everyone knows that Nilsson is the Wagnerian soprano of the Century, but can she beat out Joan Sutherland, which mad scene from Lucia may well be one of the most astonishing thing ever to be put on tape. On the male side, my wife went crazy about Franco Corelli's drop dead gorgeous movie star looks. She keeps rewinding that portion of the DVD. I have to admit he is a good looking guy, but I'm more impressed with his superhuman tenor voice. He is probably the tenor of the Century along with Mario Del Monaco.
This is a thrilling opera potpouri that my wife and I can't stop watching. If it was a tape, we would have worn it out months ago! I give it 10 stars!",1059177600,7,1131,4.2407407407407405

7931206,5,B000055XTE,"As a young opera fan living in a small town in the 1950's and `60's, I eagerly, and impatiently waited for the periodic Bell Telephone Hour television presentations, many of which included the opera stars of the day in arias or scenes.  Now, in the age of DVD's, videos, and Live From the Met, it may be difficult for a newer opera fan to understand the impact these performances had when they were originally broadcast.  What is not difficult to understand is why the performers on this DVD were counted among the international stars of their generation.  These are world-class performances, captured, for the most part, when the singers were at the peak of their careers.
Yes, some of the hair-styles and evening gowns are very dated and some of the acting edges toward semaphore, but it is important to remember that when these performances were broadcast, most opera singers did not have established television technique.  They were accustomed to standing on a stage at a great distance from an audience and emoting physically as well as vocally.  Rather than criticizing the lapses into histrionic excess - and there really not that many - today's viewers should be amazed that the presentational style is as natural as it is.
Several scenes, Sutherland's technically astonishing and dramatically impressive Mad Scene and Price's intense, gorgeously sung Trovatore aria are fully staged with costumes and elaborate sets; others scenes are in concert form, with the singer in evening dress standing in front of abstract backgrounds or orchestra.  Ultimately, however, it is the singing that should, and does, take center stage.
Here is an opportunity to hear a fresh-voiced, dramatically-engaged Birgit Nilson singing one of her signature arias, In Questa Reggia (watch what she does with the cape part of her gown!), to hear Leontyne Price, whom some have called the perfect Verdi singer, in excerpts from two of her acclaimed portrayals, and to hear the lush voice of Eileen Farrell in Isolde's Liebstod.  The camera work in Farrell's performance is exceptionally close, catching the depth of feeling in her eyes.
Although the performances are weighted toward sopranos, there is excellent work from tenors Franco Corelli and Richard Tucker as well as from baritone's Robert Merrill and George London who sings an intense scene from Boris Goudonov in English.  (One can not help but wonder, in retrospect, if Russian was deemed inappropriate for an American television audience at the height of the cold war.)  In one of the few duets (there are no larger ensembles represented here), Simionato and Vickers ""eat the scenery"" in admirable Italianate style in their Amneris, Radames scene.
The performance by mezzo Rise Stevens is a double bonus, first because there are not as many preserved examples of her performing, and second, because her selection, from Victor Herbert's Natoma is an operatic rarity.  Hearing this haunting music performed by a top-notch performer like Miss Stevens will undoubtedly send some opera buffs to the internet to look for more of both.
As an introduction to opera and operatic style, as a retrospective of singers from the second half of the 20th century, or as sheer entertainment, this DVD is a ""must.""  (By the way, navigation is very easy so that one can watch the whole DVD in sequence, or select scenes, one at a time.)",1006905600,54,3363,5.052346570397112
