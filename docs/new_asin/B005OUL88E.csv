4854965,4,B005OUL88E,"I saw Billy Blanks Jr on Shark Tank and bought the dvd's that night.  I think he and his wife are great and they seem to really love what they do.  My only problem is no matter how coordinated I want to be I just can't keep up.  I love to try, but I just can't dance.  I can do all the moves as he instructs them but at the end when it all gets put together I am not so great.  I hope that practice will improve that and look forward to continuing to use these videos.",1345334400,12,468,3.7346938775510203
4854966,3,B005OUL88E,"I miss the old dancers, the old ""home base,"" and the old format! Not as fun as the other DVDs, sorry to say. I love Billy Blanks Jr but I hope he finds his old pals and does another!",1325980800,9,182,3.6923076923076925
4854967,4,B005OUL88E,"I really like doing Dance with Me Cardio Fit, so I bought this one. As in Cardio Fit, Billy Blanks is encouraging and friendly. I think these moves are a little harder to learn and have more jumping to them. That's good for cardio, but if your knees bother you you'd want to modify a little--and he suggests modifications as he goes along.

I've been doing dance videos for about 5 years, and what makes this one different and a little harder to follow than CardioFit is that the set's a bit dark and you can't always see the dancers' feet clearly when you're learning the steps. Instead of the floor of a brightly lit room, the dancers are on a stage at varying heights (some on sort of wide pedestals). The effect is more theatrical than usual, with light and shadows across the stage. The lighting's only a problem SOMEtimes, and of course not once you learn the steps. The dances themselves are fun, all with a hip hop slant to them--basic hip hop, Bollywood Hip Hop, and Samba Hip Hop.

His wife is one of the dancers, but this time she doesn't speak.",1324857600,28,1056,4.410256410256411
4854968,5,B005OUL88E,"I have never reviewed a DVD program I have directed. But I couldn't resist writing about this new one from Billy for one specific reason: Billy himself. In the 25 years Ive been producing fitness and dance video/ DVD programs I have seldom come across with an instructor who works as hard or for as long choreographing dance moves and sequences that most people can learn to do, enjoy, and benefit from - not just only people with a dance background. While hip hop dancing by it's own nature can scare off some, the basic structure of it's signature moves and rhythms are little other than moves we all perform during most of our daily common physical day that when executed consecutively at a faster pace provide an incredibly effective fat burning low impact cardiovascular challenging workout. And in this DVD Billy has created a series of short workout periods each with just enough repetition and interaction of sequences that make each easier and fun to do . To me he is a 5 star instructor. But I leave his program's rating to you.",1324857600,19,1038,4.646739130434782

4854992,2,B005OUL88E,"I have the Shaun T Hip Hop Abs and Rockin Body DVD sets and I really like them. I've been using these DVDs for years, and thought I'd try something new so I got this DVD.  I'm disapointed that I bought it.  Not what I was hoping for.  I don't really like the music and the emphasis seems to be more on dance steps than moving and exercising.  I just wanted something that made me sweat and was fun.  I can generally pickup the choreography fairly quickly.  But, these steps are too involved to start sweating right away - I had to concentrate too much on the steps so it wasn't fun.  Also, once or twice he showed modifications for lower impact, but not always.",1424736000,3,661,4.24

I have knee problems and I have about 60 lbs to lose, and find other videos Ive tried are too much impact for me. This video is perfect, he offers modifications.",1408492800,,325,4.015384615384615

4855007,4,B005OUL88E,Think that  Billy could show how to do steps better for people who are new to his DVD'S. Saw him on Shark Tank so thought why not. Bought all 3 DVD'S. Suggestions watch a few times before you try to follow. Once you catch on it's fun.,1405382400,,234,3.978723404255319
4855008,5,B005OUL88E,"I absolutely love this workout! As someone who has a LOT to lose I found it fun and low impact enough that I could keep up by going back to ""home base"" if the moves were to hard. It took a few times of watching it to ""get"" the routine. It's challenging enough, yet my kids and I have soooo much fun! Love this! I actually look forward to working out now and 10 minutes in I'm drenched! I've lost weight each week since I started it! I was very sedentary prior however. Try it it's really fun!",1404864000,2,492,4.030612244897959
4855009,2,B005OUL88E,The workout did get your heart rate up. The last segment was a bit hard to follow- when they combine all segments. If you are looking for a dance workout that keeps you moving this is for you. If you want a challenging workout then you need to look elsewhere. It was fun to do once. I am glad I didn't buy it.,1404604800,,309,3.9206349206349205

4855011,5,B005OUL88E,"This workout gives you three dance styles; hip-hop, Bollywood and samba. It's an add-on type of workout, i.e you learn steps to build to a final combination and get to do them 3 times in a row. Not a high aerobic workout but fun, especially if you like to dance.",1402963200,,262,4.26
4855012,4,B005OUL88E,"I like it almost a lot.  As an older exerciser I have to play back quite a few times b4 I get it.  Fun learning new moves though.  I feel like I'm ""with it""  once the awkwardness is gone.  You will have a great aerobic session.",1402790400,,227,3.847826086956522

4855018,5,B005OUL88E,This is a whole lotta fun and I found it easy to learn the routines and the music is great and Billy is a really fun instructor.

4855024,2,B005OUL88E,"Billy Blanks Jr, fails to provide the guidance for the next sequence of steps that you need to do.  The exercise program seems good, but you don't know when he is changing the routine until it has been executed.  Also seemed like it was produced in his garage.  Deleted it immediately from my 'Prime Video' watchlist.",1391990400,4,317,4.625

4855026,3,B005OUL88E,"The class will get you moving but I felt some of the moves weren't broken down enough and it was easy to get lost.  He would also make the assumption that you remembered the combinations and he didn't always tell you what was coming up next which meant I was playing catch up.  Overall all the main goal of getting my body moving was met, just would have been nice to feel like I knew what was going on more often.",1391472000,,414,4.098765432098766

4855028,2,B005OUL88E,"I have been working out to Tae-Bo (Billy Blanks Sr.) for almost 10 years now and I love his workouts. I was watching ""Shark Tank"" one day and on came Billy Blanks Jr. and his wife. I had no idea Billy Blanks even had a son! Anyways, I am always looking for new workouts and after seeing him on the show I ordered this DVD hoping for something fun that gives me a good workout.

I am disappointed by this workout. Billy is very likeable and energetic but I find the steps, or dances, in this workout too complex and hard to follow. The workout will make you sweat but you will even see the other people in the background of the video messing up on the steps. I am young and an avid exerciser but I would suggest Billy make a new workout video with easier dance moves!",1390348800,3,766,4.140939597315437

This was one of them and I'm soooo glad I tried it!!  It definitely confirms that I have little coordination but as with other work out videos, I am certain I'll get the steps down!!  I liked Zumba but found ""Berto"" annoying after awhile.  I'm sure I'll feel the same way about this one too but until then, I'll keep doing it!!!! GIVE THIS A TRY!
