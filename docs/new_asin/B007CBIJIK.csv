8514427,2,B007CBIJIK,Basically they show kids saying hello the whole DVD.  Was expecting a whole lot more.,1413417600,,85,4.666666666666667
8514428,1,B007CBIJIK,"Inordinately overpriced, haphazardly edited, poorly acted out ....furthermore, the rock and roll fast track music that has been interspersed in between the lame greetings makes it for an irritatingly atrocious kids video production.....The title may read SOCIAL SKILLS...this would sell better if it were titled SOCIALLY UNSKILLED PRODUCERS......My son cringes and grimaces and shudders each time the background music begins to play out of place, out of tune and out of nowhere....the so called kid actors in the video obviously have never performed in front of a live camera.....the producers seemed to have randomly picked up the kids off the streets and had them recite the lines verbatim to the point of ennui and then rewarded them with ice-cream snacks......the sequence of greetings tends to repeat and hop aimlessly as if it were on a wobbly checker game board....and finally the price...30 BIG WHOPPING BUCKS for 30 SHAMELESS MINUTES of SOCIAL ETIQUETTE TRAVESTY.....If you are contemplating forking over your hard earned money on purchasing this ""nauseous"" DVD.....DON'T",1409011200,2,1080,5.473053892215569
8514429,5,B007CBIJIK,This video is well done.  It breaks the skill of meeting and greeting into basic components for people who have social disorders like autism.  Example:  First thing to do when meeting/greeting is SMILE. The actors (kids) look like they are really enjoying helping others learn.,1399852800,,277,5.111111111111111
8514430,5,B007CBIJIK,"I use these video series for helping to teach manners to my two year old. He loves watching 'big kids' interact and really pays attention to the explanations that are given. As for the production quality I am very impressed with the quality of the DVD's. For parents they may seem boring but for kids they are exactly what is needed for their understanding. I have most of the videos from this company Spectrum, Bumblebee, and a few from the Jenny McCarthy group (which I like but not as well as the BumbleBee or Spectrum DVD's).  Even if your kids are not on the autism Spectrum these videos can be really useful for young children to learn how to model good behavior and use their manners.",1341360000,8,691,4.484126984126984
