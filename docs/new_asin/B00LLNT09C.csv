8666407,5,B00LLNT09C,"Once again Kate Marshal Graphics has not only brought their unique talent for nature and the beautiful landscapes of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park to the screen but has now coupled this with a history of one of the most unique places in the GSNP.
  Anyone who has had the pleasure of visiting Cades Cove in the park knows its beauty but few actually have little idea of its rich and varied history. This is real jem for those who love and cherish the Cove.
 This a visual and oral history of the lives and times before the National Park Service took over and the real Cove and the people who called it home were forced to change their lives and the Cove as they knew it. Many of the people who are interviewed are no longer with us and without this documentary their stories would be lost to us forever. The passion of their history and the true pride in their love of Cades Cove is brought out time and again.
  This series of videos is a must for anyone who wants and desires to know more of the people and history of the Beloved people and place that is Cades Cove. Can't wait for the next one!!!!!!!",1405814400,4,1112,4.276190476190476
