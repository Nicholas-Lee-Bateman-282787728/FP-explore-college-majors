7984179,4,B00008G96R,"Loved these guys when I was a kid,still do. Only regret was that they weren't in color like their 1/2 hour shows.",1370822400,,113,4.181818181818182
7984180,5,B00008G96R,"This release from VCI is overall pretty good.  The films are entertaining, splice-free and complete.  They are not restored and you will experience some audio hiss and night scenes which can be a bit dark.  Otherwise, very good presentation.  The 1970's interview is great.",1352592000,,273,5.136363636363637
7984181,5,B00008G96R,"I thoroughly enjoyed both movies on this DVD.  Both of the stories are quite good. The picture quality is also quite good.  The sound tracks of both movies have a noticeable hissing sound that is best described as being like the surface noise from playing a worn vinyl record.  Keep the volume turned down a bit and it is not that bad.  Definitely do not let that keep you from buying the movies.

A very pleasant discovery on this DVD was finding that the interview with Col. Tim McCoy and Duncan Renaldo was the PBS program in which noted author Jon Tuska (""The Filming of the West"") was host to a series featuring the B-western.  I think it was entitled, ""They Went Thataway"" but may be mistaken as it has been since around 1971 that I saw those programs.  The interview with Duncan Renaldo on the other Cisco Kid double feature is also taken from that series.  I had never expected to see those programs again.  One reviewer states that this interview was done in 1975 but I am positive I remember it as being several years earlier.

The Cisco Kid and Pancho have always been among my favorite cowboy stars.  As a kid, I listened to their radio program which I seem to remember being on the air two or three evenings per week.  I bought a lot of the comic books and they were very well done.  Of course, I saw the Cisco Kid at the movies and on television. I credit Cisco and Pancho with teaching me many Spanish words.  I do not speak Spanish but there are so many of the words which I recognize in print and remember from my exposure to the Cisco Kid.  There was an educational value to them.

Leo Carrillo is, in my opinion, one of the very best sidekicks or character actors in the old westerns.  His humor brought a lot to the Cisco Kid series.",1326844800,,1753,4.328220858895706
7984182,5,B00008G96R,"Many westerns seem to be about bullies who are bored so they look for someone in the town to pick on.
But The Cisco Kid is different. It's like watching a detective solve a murder case.

I thoroughly enjoyed both movies on this double feature DVD. Cisco is the smart one, but Pancho isn't far behind--he's a goofball with a purpose.

Did you know Leo Carrillo could speak Chinese fluently? (One of the interesting tidbits Duncan Renaldo tells us in the interview included on this disc.)",1319155200,,486,4.6395348837209305
7984183,5,B00008G96R,"As a 9-year old kid in 1951 I always had an intrigue for the TV series, I never saw the full length movies.
  I always loved the background music of the old western movies and TV shows and I always liked to hum this music, especially Cisco's background music while playing cowboys and indians.
  Surprisingly, all the Cisco TV shows were filmed in color despite the very limited number of Color TV sets in use (beginning in 1954 at $1300 per set).
  Old man time has taken it's toll on the old celluloid color prints and it shows in these selections. Given the circumstances I think the vendor did an excellent job of reproducing the old episodes at a very reasonable price.
  Since this is a niche product (low demand) the producer could not be expected to go through an expensive restoration process and expect a return on his investment.
  I'm giving this collection a vote of 5 stars for its historical significance
and reasonable reproduction of the original episodes.
  If you're expecting digital quality from this collection it isn't there(yet).
  Each episode has a list of the actors at the end. Google the biography of these actors and it will probably surprise you how many and what films and TV shows they've been in. Many of them are or would be famous at the time these episodes were made.",1293408000,,1304,4.613043478260869
7984184,5,B00008G96R,"VCI has done a superb job all the way around. Wonderful transfer and picture quality for the Cisco films that, until today, was only available on VHS in poor quality transfers.

Recommend the Cisco book from the University Press by Francis M. Nevins as a companion piece.",1222300800,2,271,4.76595744680851
7984185,4,B00008G96R,"This review is for VCI's THE CISCO KID Double feature, starring Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo. This entertaining double feature DVD is published by VCI and formatted for worldwide distribution (Region 0), which means it will play anywhere in the world.

The two movies are:

""Satan's Cradle"", 1948, where Cisco comes to the aid of a preacher who was beaten up and left in the desert to die after denouncing the evil elements of Silver City. The murderous gang is led by a widow woman and Cisco has to use all his canning and charm to defeat her and restore law and order.

The second feature is ""The Daring Caballero"" - 1949. Cisco and Pancho rescue a young boy's father who is about to be hanged for a murder he did not commit. Since time is running out, Cisco has but one night to uncover evidence that the man is innocent and expose the culprits.

Though not restored, both films are in a fair to good state, and play well, without jumps, missing frames, or annoying scratches.

The DVD also includes a Photo and Poster Gallery, biographies of Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo plus an interview with Colonel Tim McCoy and Duncan Renaldo where they relive the days when they were top western stars and felt responsible for presenting a wholesome role model for youngsters.",1170460800,3,1275,4.648888888888889

INTERVIEW with DUNCAN RENALDO

1. Very informative and enlightening interview in 1975 with Duncan Renaldo and Colonel Tim McCoy discussing their careers and behind the scenes of movie making.  Topic was the difference between B-Westerns and A-Westerns and the violence in todays films.

2. In 1980, Renaldo received a Special Lifetime Achievement Award from Nosotros, which honored him for ""providing a postive Hispanic role model for Americans""...and what's more states ""The Cisco Kid"" a perennial television favorite.

3. This DVD is dedicated in Loving Memory of Duncan Renaldo 1904-1980

Renaldo was in his '60s and Carillo in his '70s when they appeared at the ""Firemen's Rodeo"" in St. Louis during the '50s ~ my Grandmother and Great Aunt took me to see them, and I believe both of them had a crush on the two actors (Renaldo and Carrillo) came galloping out into the center of the arena, every kid in attendance was in awe, as I was and when the show was over, I rode my imaginary horse home.

Own them now on DVD....if you crave action, drama and plenty of adventure then this is the place for all of the above...if you enjoyed this double feature check out another VCI Entertainment presents ""The Cisco Kid Double Feature Vol. 1"" (Dolby digitally remastered), featuring Duncan Renaldo as Cisco and Leo Carrillo as his comical sidekick Pancho and in the first film Martin Garralaga plays Pancho...from Monogram Pictures is ""South of the Rio Grande"" (1945) and United Artists ""The Girl from San Lorenzo"" (1950)...the story lines are excellent with outstanding action scenes and productions with hours worth of entertainment
