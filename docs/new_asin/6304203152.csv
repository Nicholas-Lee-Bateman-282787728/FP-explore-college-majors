808123,1,6304203152,Pro Taliban anti-American crap! Unbelievable. Don't waste your time! Tragic end to a once great series. I cannot believe this was even made. Outrageous!,1349222400,2,152,5.375
808124,3,6304203152,"I imagine Robbie Coltrane and Jimmy McGovern had high hopes for this reunion.  But apparently Mr. McGovern had a political ax to grind that got in the way of creating a truly Fitz-worthy yarn.  And the episode seemed lacking in Fitz for stretches of time, much of which was spent establishing the state of mind driving a killer.  And then Fitz found himself working alone, alone without the dynamic generated among his familiar cast of disparagers at the Manchester PD.  None of those cops are even present in this episode, perhaps having read the script before signing on.  Instead we see a squad of strangers whose character and disposition have no time to develop.  And the dark, gritty look of the earlier episodes has been dressed up with a number of sunny scenes quite out of keeping with our expectation of Fitz's Manchester.  Altogether not a fitting tribute to a superior series.",1326931200,,888,4.802631578947368
808125,5,6304203152,"This is the final episode in the very fine and enjoyable story about a psychologist, Fitz, who has severe disruptive psychological problems: he drinks and gambles too much and he prefers to help the police rather than be with his family. These problems disturb his patient wife. Fitz and his wife, who lived in Australia for a decade, return to England for a daughter's wedding. He is drunk at the wedding and makes inappropriate remarks. They find England changed because of the Iraq war and terrorism. While this is an opportunity for Fitz and his wife to spend time with grandchildren, Fitz chooses instead to help the police find a person who killed an American comic. We are shown the murder and the murderer. We see how the man has been traumatized by the war in Northern Ireland seeing his mates killed. He is bitter against the Americans who he holds responsible because they supplied the guns and other weapons, directly and indirectly, in Northern Ireland and Iraq. Fitz's deductions are clever and fun to watch, although a couple are questionable, such as when he tells the police that when men urinate in a public toilet with three adjacent basins, they generally choose one near the end, and  if a man is killed in a public toilet it must have been a spontaneous unplanned murder.",1321747200,,1293,4.746666666666667
808126,3,6304203152,"OK.  This is Cracker's last story, and it works hard on getting things set pretty quickly.  You miss some old characters but that's the way some of these ""reunion"" last episodes are.  The problem is that in the middle of the video it starts to feel like too many things were done to just show one more case, but character development wasn't clear since the middle of the story.  It felt more like all the changes you saw in the beginning were slowly erased as they were all getting ""back to the old habits"".
To me, it felt so inconclusive.  Not the cliffhanger/I-want-to-see-more kind but something disappointing instead.  And in the end, it becomes just one more case, not the time to say good-bye to a character or a story you like, but just one last time to see the show.",1302134400,,774,4.453900709219858
808127,5,6304203152,It doesn't really seem plausible that Fitz could survive away from Manchester's Police department. Presumably he's found similar work in Australia. My only problem with the story was his embarassing performance at his daughter's wedding reception. It seems a bit of a cliche at this point. Otherwise it was an interesting turn to see the whole 9-11 issue from the outside looking in. The problem most people have with this approach lies in facing the fact that all actions (or inactions) have consequences. You can condemn those consequences but you can't honestly deny their causes.,1285459200,,583,5.147368421052631
808128,1,6304203152,"Old fat detectives that don't grow up?  Charming back in 1993 not so much anymore.  I got the set when it didn't include this one and it was intriguing and charming, and who doesn't love Robbie Coltrane, but as you can see, so far, only 3 reviewers gave this a 5 star, now go and see the reviews for the old Cracker Series and you'll see how far the mighty have fallen.",1278547200,3,369,4.111111111111111
808129,3,6304203152,"This might have been called 'the Return of Cracker', since Fitz has been in Australia for a decade and returns to find a new Manchester.  This one is fueled by drug money.  The atmospherics are created by a series of quick-cut montages with loud news reports in the background, all of them focusing on war, terrorism and the politicians held responsible for them.  In the subsidiary material on the DVD, Robbie Coltrane points out that the writer (Jimmy McGovern) is motivated to write by his personal experience and personal anger.  In this case, he's angry about Iraq (and still angry about the work of the IRA in Ulster and beyond).  Presumably, he's also angry about what's happened to Manchester and the cause of all of these problems and issues is, in his judgment, the US.  This will seem strange to American audiences, for my guess is that the strongest supporters of the war in Iraq do not overlap significantly with the American supporters of the IRA, i.e., those who have supported the IRA with American dollars.  They're both American, of course, but the point is that blind blame of the 'USA' lacks nuance, since many Americans do not support the effort in Iraq and many find the actions of the IRA horrific (along with the support of it by American citizens).

This is important to the film since the murderer (superbly played by Anthony Flanagan) has been a soldier in Ulster and is haunted by the memories of his experience there.  The problem is that he comes across as a decent, even likeable man whose actions are explainable, if not justified, by his experience.  In many ways he carries the film, since he is on screen almost constantly.  It is an old rule of narrative that we come to like prominent villains because we have come to know them well.  That is certainly the case here, particularly when his victims are unpleasant types who deserve some punishment (if not in the form that they receive).  The bottom line is that Fitz is brilliant but unpleasant and irresponsible (as always) and his antagonist in this story has many redeeming features, while the cause of his condition and the blame (totally) laid at the feet of the US seems to lack nuance.  The wonderful psychological complexities of both the protagonist and antagonist are undercut by the political screed which constitutes the historical backdrop for the action and atmospherics of the setting.  It's worth watching, but--to this viewer--off the mark in its effects on the audience.",1234742400,,2475,4.817966903073286
808130,4,6304203152,"This is a movie adapted from the british tv series, it takes places several years after the series has ended, for the fans of this series it is a must have and as always Amazon has the best price.",1229385600,,196,4.051282051282051
808131,3,6304203152,"Wow, this is most certainly NOT as good as the previous 3 Cracker DVD's.
I should have minded the reviews and not bought it, because it was one long tirade against anything American and even suggests 9/11 was manufactured and we Americans deserved it!!
It's a shame to see Robby Coltrane accept such drivel, I guess he needed extra money!
I'm throwing my copy in the trash where it belongs, and hope they do not produce any more, if I want to hear American-bashing and USA - bashing I'll watch the daily news (sadly)
That's my 2 cents and God Bless America!",1221696000,4,557,4.470588235294118
808132,3,6304203152,"""Cracker: A New Terror,"" a free-standing episode of the highly-popular, highly-acclaimed, award-winning British 1990's television detective series -- it made its initial debut in 1993 -- was made by Granada, in 2006, for British Independent Television (ITV).  It was seen in the United States on BBC America, and released here on DVD in late 2007.  The mystery/thriller was written by the veteran Jimmy McGovern, creator of the series, and writer of some of its strongest episodes, and directed by Antonia Bird (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hamburg-Cell/dp/B000I2J6KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hamburg Cell</a>.) It stars, as usual, Robbie Coltrane, who since this 1990s TV triumph that first made him famous, has gone on to burnish his name on the bigger screen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Twelve/dp/1419831879/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Twelve</a>; the ""Harry Potter"" series, and a couple of ""James Bond 007s.""  It is billed as the final episode of ""Cracker,"" though some of us surely hope not.

In this feature-length production, Coltrane reprises his title role as Dr. Edward ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald, controversial criminologist, abrasive, arrogant and brilliant psychologist.  Coltrane dominates the film, of course, with his powerful portrayal of his character.  At any rate, Fitz, his long-suffering wife Judith (Barbara Flynn), and their youngest son supposedly have lived as ex-pats in Australia for nearly a decade, while he grapples with his addictions to drink, cigarettes and gambling.  They now return to their hometown, Manchester, for the wedding of his daughter.  Fitz is, of course, older, fatter, and grayer, and, as a further result of his heavy indulgences, he's looking into Viagra.  But he's still capable of rising to the occasion: he can mortify his daughter at her wedding; and get himself involved in helping the local police solve a puzzling murder case.

Fitz finds England much changed in the aftermath of America's horrendous 9/11 terrorist experience; and we are given frequent big bites of TV news shows dealing with American President George Bush, English Prime Minister Tony Blair, and our war in Iraq. Fitz also finds Manchester, a beautiful and interesting city that we don't generally see over here, greatly changed since he left: taxi drivers tell him the changes are due to American, Irish, and drug money: that the city's awash in drugs.  The city's also awash in its own accent, that we on these shores would find difficult; happily, the DVD offers unadvertised closed captioning, among its advertised extra features: interviews with Coltrane, Flynn, McGovern, and other cast members, etc.

The murder investigation centers on a handsome, unusually sensitive young local cop, Kenny Archer, played by Anthony Flanagan.  He appears to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his previous service in the bloody, long-running war in Northern Ireland.  And he's come up with a series of interesting theories that blame everything on the U.S.  We're responsible for the Northern Ireland war, as we -- mainly our Irish-Americans, of course-- bankrolled it. (And there are a couple of anti-Irish cracks in the film's text, too.) The terrorist attacks of 9/11 are nothing more than the terrorism we sponsored in Northern Ireland come home to haunt us, as well.  We're also responsible for Manchester's drug problem, as we then threw the Taliban, the ruling clique of anti-American,Islamic crazies, who were controlling the drug trade, out of Afghanistan.  Almost needless to say, finally, we're responsible for the mess in Iraq, and the deaths of British troops there.  Did I mention that, beyond its undoubted competence as a mystery/thriller, the film is very anti-American, and will infuriate some possible viewers, who'd best give it a miss?",1217203200,15,3912,5.624149659863946
808183,3,6304203152,"Except for a surprise about a third into the show, this cop story is so predictable that I don't feel guilty about talking in detail about the plot, though I'll try not to spoil anything important. But you've been warned.

This story is ruined by copying American cop show cliches (both in the subject matter of the story and in the TV techniques used to tell it).

There's the extended brutality of a junkie being beaten senseless.

After flashbacks of a killer's memory of dead children lying on a floor, we see our hero climb stairs to where he knows there are children. We see the legs of the children on the floor, motionless, then we see our hero's pained face, then we see the children alive and smiling, watching TV (just like we are at this point). Why the horrified expression on our hero if the kids are all right? It's just a gimmick.

One of the things this story supposedly tries to do is make Americans look bad.

One of the victims is an American who's ""sniffing around our women"" and who treats the Manchester police like valets (in the American, not the British, sense of the word).

Most of the killer's victims are Americans who show a lack of respect for  the British military. (It's a joke about the British in Northern Ireland that triggers the first murder, not anything to do with Bush's war in Iraq or his ""lap dog"" Tony Blair.)

In fact, the cause of all these murders is Britain's occupation of Belfast, not the U.S. occupation of Iraq.

As it turns out, the Manchester police would have found the killer just as soon even if they hadn't enticed Fitz away from his family.

Of course Fitz confronts the killer and gets him to admit to trying to get the police to kill him because he's afraid to commit suicide. But it looks to me like it's Fitz who's trying to get the killer to kill him, because Fitz can't deal any more with being a drunk and a compulsive gambler who's driven all the people who love him away. (This scene is a cheat, too, making it seem the killer may be granting Fitz his self-destructive wish, but you know he can't be.)

This whole story could have been told if the attacks on September 11 had never happened. I think the producers just wanted to make the story more relevant by tying it to what what Robert Harris in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost-A-Novel/dp/1416551816/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost: A Novel</a>&nbsp;called ""a new Hundred Years War.""",1203638400,2,2464,4.733644859813084
808184,5,6304203152,"Fitz is so endearing because he is truly flawed. He smokes, gambles and definitely drinks too much. Just ask his daughter what she thinks about the toast he gave to her groom at their wedding. Yet, he manages to solve the latest string of murder cases by interrogating and exposing the culprit even though the police constable doesn't really listen to his ideas. And Fitz is brutally honest to his wife when he admits to her that he would rather spend time with the police officers than with his own grandchild. In response to the reviewers who thought the episode was too political and anti-American, I say that Cracker has always taken on the controversial issues of it's time. That is one of the factors which make the detective story seem realistic and intriguing to its fans. The worthwhile special features on the DVD include interviews with Robbie Coltrane, Jimmy McGovern, Barbara Flynn, Chris Eccleston and other members of the cast and creative team.",1199491200,8,960,4.859756097560975

808186,3,6304203152,This was a disappointing return by Robbie Coltraine to what was a cracker of a series in its day.  The plot was not nearly as interesting as previous episodes and the ending very predictable.,1195862400,3,191,4.617647058823529
808187,5,6304203152,"I was waiting for this one for a long time. ""Fitz"" is brilliant, as usual. And (as usual) he continues to be self-destructive. Having been away from England for 10 years, Fitz returns for his daughter's wedding but ends up helping the police crack open a murder investigation. The episode is truly worthwhile because it is used to highlight the differences between the ""old"" and the ""new"" i.e. the old city vs the new city, the old police department vs the new department, old crime vs new terror threat. The amazing thing is that even though everything has changed, Fitz hasn't. And it is precisely for that reason that he succeeds here also.",1194998400,4,643,4.699115044247788

808189,1,6304203152,"Robbie Coltrane is an amazing actor.  He owns Cracker.  Everything previous to this was wonderful to watch, but this one is so full of anti American propaganda that it sickened me.  Had I known just how anti American it was I would never have purchased it. It felt like a punch below the belt.

Addition to first posting (01.26.09):

I have had a chance to watch this again since my first review. I think I was in a ugly mood that day. Maybe passing kidney stones or something like that. This is really not as bad as I made it out to be.  I like the Cracker series and will watch it again I am sure.

808190,5,6304203152,"Robbie Coltrane is back in this thriller...he's older, fatter, and even more restless and risks his family, the admiration of his son, and his time with his new granddaughter, to ""get on"" with an intriguing case. Someone is killing people by breaking their necks. In the meantime you really get into the head of the killer, who is a vulnerable, sympathetic character and you gain a different perspective on the IRA problem. All the regulars appear in this full-length episode and I was thrilled to get back to the series; so well-acted, each and every character perfectly cast, as always.

808191,5,6304203152,"While the ""Sopranos"" has certainly earned its accolades, to some of us ""Yanks"", it merely signals that American T.V. has FINALLY caught up with the type of cinematic-quality writing, acting and production that British viewers have been treated to for years on series like ""Cracker"". Previously only available in the U.S. on cable, (""edited for content""...boo! hiss!) you can now catch the show on video. Once you are introduced to Robbie Coltrane's profane, alcoholic, over-eating, chain-smoking, adulterous, gambling-addicted yet frighteningly perceptive criminal psychologist, you won't soon forget him. Similar in tone to the wonderful ""Prime Suspect"" series, every episode of ""Cracker"" is packed with a taut, suspenseful story, gritty, intelligent dialogue and top notch ensemble work from stars down to the bit players. If you can score all the videos and then figure out chronological order, you will notice compelling subplots that are cleverly interwoven with each specific case, yet continue from show to show. This collection is as good an introduction as any to one of the best TV programs in recent memory. PLEASE don't confuse this version with the inferior (but mercifully short-lived) U.S. remake of the series with entirely different casts!",1006300800,7,1256,5.479381443298969

7864617,1,6304203152,"I really enjoyed the Cracker series, until this episode.  Robbie Coltrane brought this gritty character to life, but, at best, he was just an afterthought  in this episode.  This wasn't a Cracker episode, it was a ""let's bash the Americans"" diatribe.  The nasty Americans funded terrorism in Northern Ireland and then the terrorists came to America; Serves them right!  This is the message being beaten out throughout this episode.  Meanwhile, we're supposed to feel sorry for the killer because the nasty, bad Americans have turned him into a vigilante-killing cop.  Give me a break.  Don't preach your ethics to me and then expect me to sympathize with yet another form of law-breaking terrorist!  If you're a fan of the first 4 seasons/episodes, don't waste your time on this one.  You won't enjoy it if you're hoping to visit with your old friend Fitz.  He's barely a blip on the radar.

In regards to Ireland, the Brits are not without blood on their hands.  Read your history people, and might I suggest starting with the executions that followed the Easter Uprising of 1916.  Don't use the Americans as a scapegoat for what the Brits started in Ireland hundreds of years ago.

And, by the way, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 killed 8 children under the age of 12.  I suppose they ""had it coming"" because they had somehow funded the IRA as well.",1349740800,5,1350,4.754310344827586
