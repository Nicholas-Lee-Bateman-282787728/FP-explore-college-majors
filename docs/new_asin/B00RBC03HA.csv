8738437,4,B00RBC03HA,"Still love this version apart from the 2008 version. That's not why I gave this a 4-Star. The main reason why I gave this a 4-Star is because that nothing really looked improved. The visuals look slapped on to a BluRay disc (as if everything was just transferred from a DVD). You can still see the fuzziness/blur/pixels. Also, I don't like the fact that they added some unnecessary instrumentals that was not in the original (don't know if they did that to the DVD remastered version as well). Although, the visual with Lord Brahma and Sage Agastya is done nicely. Its quite the improvement in this adaptation of the Epic Ramayan.

I rather they redo the whole thing over. Like make every visual sharp as possible, keep sound effects original (the new stuff doesn't work out like battle themes, etc.). Sometimes you would hear double instrumentals at once or even the next one would come out 5 seconds later once the next scene starts (You'll have to get it to understand exactly what I'm saying - It ruins the original).

The packaging is done well! Nice Box Set!",1452729600,,1064,4.654255319148936
