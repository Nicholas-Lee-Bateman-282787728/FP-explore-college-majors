8753774,5,B01CQ8U1CK,"I have recently read all of the Ramona books to my boys (ages 5 and 8). They LOVE the books! I was hesitant to show them the movie bc I honestly thought it would be terrible. Well, it was GREAT! The actors they picked for the parts were pretty much spot-on. The movie followed the books almost to a T. I was really surprised how many of our favorite parts of the books were worked into the movie. They did a great job of working all 8 books into one timeframe for the movie. So far, pretty much every scene that I have seen is straight out of the books. If you loved the books, I definitely recommend the movie. And if you like the movie even a little, I highly recommend the books! They are classics!!",1529798400,,702,4.131386861313868
