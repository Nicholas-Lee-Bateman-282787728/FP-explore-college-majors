8497409,4,B006G3ZW6M,"This video is pretty good. The instructor does a good job pointing out the main details. Overall you can appreciate what push hand is all about. Like always you need a real life instructor to show the secret of the Fu if you know what I mean. The instructor can only give you so much in the limited time of the video. You do get a lot of information and if you have some martial arts experience you can figure out a few other details on your own.
For a beginner, I think it is pretty good. I will recommend it if you want to get some information in the art of push hands.",1459296000,,571,4.017543859649122
