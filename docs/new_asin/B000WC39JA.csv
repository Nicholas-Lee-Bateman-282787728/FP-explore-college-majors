2964349,4,B000WC39JA,"It's not obvious from the product page here on Amazon, but this is an edited version of the entire 26 episode series. It has been cut down to 2.5 hours for a movie experience. It is a good buy if you have already seen the entire series or don't want to spend the time which would be upwards of 9 hours if watched as 26 episodes. It gets the idea of the story, but of course, some good things are lost. Personally, I think GITS is too good not to see all of the details.",1202428800,9,469,3.9473684210526314

2964456,3,B000WC39JA,"It's not that great of a movie...in fact, it's not really a movie, but a collection of excerpts from a season-long television series which is rather hard to follow.  But this type of stuff being such a favorite of mine, I watched it and liked it anyway.  Also being a Christian I liked the cross and redemption analogies in the climax.  If you're going to borrow from another story, you might as well borrow from the greatest (true) story ever told!  As so many do...maybe because we know deep down that it is true?  Oh, and I didn't mind the different voice actors, like so many other reviewers...I thought they were fine.",1371513600,4,623,4.526785714285714
2964457,5,B000WC39JA,Good day to all. I got this series on DVD. And the blue-ray movie doesn't let me down. And the colors is really clear and fantastic. The action is quick and the plot makes you think about the things that's going on in the world today.,1370131200,3,234,4.108695652173913

There is just too much missing to make me enjoy this. I know it is difficult to cut an entire season down to a two-hour movie, but I suppose everyone will have something they miss when done in this fashion. If you are a casual fan, go for it, you will enjoy it. Just do yourself a favor and watch the full series after.",1357257600,2,463,4.213483146067416
2964460,5,B000WC39JA,"I love this movie.  I am not big on series volumes anime, but I love a good story movie.  This movie stands alone by itself and has explosive graphics along with hard hiiting action.  If u like Ghost in the Shell anime, but do not like looking at volumes and volumes of episodes, this is a great buy.",1255392000,4,300,4.137931034482759
2964461,2,B000WC39JA,"Just like GitS: The Laughing Man, it just sounds ""wrong"" with different actors. Kusanagi has no anguish, Batou has no menace, and Aramaki has no wisdom.

And you can buy the ""Anime Legends"" full season collection of GitS:SAC 2nd Gig for less than $20 more. That makes GitS: Individual Eleven is a poor value in my book.",1255305600,8,319,4.5964912280701755
2964462,5,B000WC39JA,"This is the second season concentrated down to 2hrs. and 40 min. For those of you who don't have the time or inclination to go through the 7 DVD series here is a way to get the essentials in an intense and violent way. I have already viewed it several times and actually prefer this two-DVD set to the whole Second Gig. While a lot is left out if you never saw the original you wouldn't know it. It holds together as a lengthy movie and has a lot of action. My understanding is the English voice actors aren't the same but I couldn't tell it. It really does save time and is entertaining besides. [Ed. note: the original 660 minute ""Ghost in the Machine S.A.C. 2nd GIG"" of which this is edited from is well worth the viewing.

I guess that had to be done for times sake, but you do seem to loose much of the detail and nuance of the story. To me it feels 'rushed' to tell its story rather than letting the viewer develop along with the plot line.

It tries to show the main story of the individual eleven, but they cut out points like how they tried to assasinate the prime minister.
