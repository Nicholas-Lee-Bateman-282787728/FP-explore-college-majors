2290768,5,B0009HLCTC,"Some movies slowly work their magic, gradually sucking you in. This film had me at hello. As soon as I heard the first few soft, compelling notes of Nino Rota's evocative score, I knew I was going to love this film. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.

A person could probably describe the basic plot of Le Notti Bianche in a single sentence; the film is simple, and all the more timeless and beautiful for being so. It is a mood piece, a tone poem, a thoughtful study of loneliness, isolation and despair in which imagery, the placing of actors and objects within each frame, is as important to establishing character and atmosphere as dialogue and action. Le Notti Bianche works primarily on an emotional level but is also vaguely profound in its existential shadings. It exists in a world halfway between fairy tale and reality, and inhabits that world so convincingly that we never question the more fantastic elements. Cinema as poetry, pure and simple.

Marcello Mastroianni plays a young office worker, new to the city, who roams the streets at night in search of an anodyne for his loneliness. It is interesting to see Mastoianni in his pre-sex symbol days, playing a character who is humble, diffident, and still quite youthful. Only three years later he would appear in La Dolce Vita as the jaded protagonist, a man already bored and angry with his sexuality. Maria Schell is his love interest, a girl so sheltered and ingenuous as to be almost unbelievable, but Schell manages to be convincing, abetted no doubt by the fact that the story is half-fairy tale and a certain suspension of disbelief is required. Jean Marais, possessor of one of the most unique visages in cinema, has a brief role, with little to do other than looking handsome and angst-ridden; he is craggier-looking than in the great films he made with Jean Cocteau, but still charismatic.

The tone of the film is almost like an unbroken line, rarely deviating from its somber pace, with the exception of a couple of key scenes. During the most important and eventful night of the story, the main characters visit a dancehall, and the scene within is wild, sexual, like something out of Fellini, in fact it might have been an influence on the crazy dance scene in La Dolce Vita. Later, Mastroianni's character temporarily hooks up with a woman who has been admiring him for the past few nights, stalking him almost, their encounter ending in a violent confrontation with some street thugs. The way Mastroianni discards the woman is brutal, thoughtless and unsettling, and adds an uncomfortable layer of darkness to the overall sweetness of the character, and the film.

Le Notti Bianche is different than other films in Luchino Visconti's oevre, which tend to be less visually poetic, more melodramatic. The film is certainly as operatic as other Visconti works, but in a more subtle way, how it melds music with the emotion of the moment so perfectly. It's like a Puccini opera, but without the suicide, the crying and screaming, the death by consumption. It tells a gentle story, sad, moving and totally engrossing.",1140393600,60,3100,4.832391713747646
2290769,4,B0009HLCTC,"Luchino Visconti wanted this movie to be real and unreal, so a multi-layered city set was built inside a studio. It has a running river, bridges, busy streets, wind, fog and snow, all nicely lit and photographed in black-and-white. We learn this and more from an extra The Criterion Collection has included in this classy edition. ""White Nights"" is a dreamy romance, adapted from a Dostoyevsky short story and quite unlike other films by Visconti. Critics and admirers of the director will roll their eyes or sigh gratefully for that.

It's far from the scale of ""The Leopard"" and ""The Damned."" Two lonely people meet on a bridge. As he grows fond of her, he tries to convince her to forget the man she loves and who has vowed to return. The ending may surprise you, but little else will. There are compensations, however. Maria Schell learned Italian for her role and is memorable in it, Marcello Mastrioanni is earnest and likeable, and Jean Marais is a mysterious presence. Visconti's intimate neo-realistic touches are happily starting to emerge. ""White Nights"" won some awards in 1957 and may yet win some hearts today.",1126396800,19,1124,4.854166666666667
2290770,5,B0009HLCTC,"The director Luchino Visconti is known for many different films such as Ossessione (1943), The Leopard (1963), and Death in Venice (1971), but the style that many link him with is the Italian neo-realism.  However, many of Visconti's films do not follow the school of Italian neo-realism, as he uses heavy sense of artistic expression.  Yet, he continues to explore the tangible through allegorical, metaphorical, and symbolical illustrations, which suggest that he never separated himself from realism, or what truly exists.  Visconti remained true to the idea that what he displays exists, however, what exists could also have a more profound meaning on an intangible level.  For example, even though Visconti broke off with Italian neo-realism in Le Notti Bianche through fantasy like visuals, the audience can still see the strong influence from the Italian neo-realism.

Visconti continued to make his own adaptations of already existing works throughout his career, and he freely changed the works to fit his own vision.  Le Notti Bianche is no exception to this notion, as Visconti tailored Fyodor Dostoyevsky White Nights to fit his idea.  Both stories deal with a lonely man and lonely woman, but the differences emerge through Visconti's cinematic illustrations.  The film takes place during the winter unlike the book, which is staged in the spring.  Despite the free adaptation, the Italian filmmaker succeeds in creating an astonishing story that keeps the audience compelled to experience the agonized love of lost and yearning spirits.

The film opens one late night when Mario (Marcello Mastroianni) wanders the town where he is a stranger.  He has recently relocated due to work, and finds himself restless and lonely.  During Mario's nightly walk he encounters a weeping young woman on a bridge.  He later learns her name, Natalia (Maria Schell), a woman equally lonely, which is also the reason she is weeping.  Briefly before Mario introduces himself to Natalia, he defends her reputation against two young men who give her sexually suggestive insinuations.  Superficially, Mario is a modern man with values influenced by the modern society, as he subtly frowns upon old traditions and values.  Yet, he secretively respects the old traditions when it favors him, which leaves him in emotional twilight that at times confuses him.

After Mario and Natalia have introduced themselves to each other, they plan a rendezvous the following evening on the bridge where they first met even though Natalia is hesitant about the idea.  The three following evenings Mario learns more about Natalia, as they meet on equal terms on the bridge where they first bumped into each other.  She is a woman that has been raised by her grandmother who strongly holds on traditional values.  At first, Mario frowns at how she has been raised, but becomes more enthralled by her naive and childlike persona.  He also learns that she has been waiting for her beloved on the bridge for year, which has left her in a loneliness that has had an emotionally draining affect on her.

The canal over which the bridge divides the two worlds that they come from in the old-fashion and modern.  Mario coming from the modern world to which he attempts to attract her away from her fantasy world where she dreams of her knight in shining armor.  Each night Mario attempts to lure Natalia into his side of the canal where the bars, neon signs, and other attractions exert a pull on her.  Slowly she begins to cross the canal over the bridge more frequently, which has strong symbolical meaning in the sense of decision making while the canal serves as metaphorical divider for moral values.  Thus, in retrospect, speechlessness renders the viewer in the first scene where Mario crosses the bridge upon which Natalia is crying, as profound symbolism in regards to choices and ideals.

Le Notti Bianche is entirely shot in a studio, which is obvious.  However, the removal of the authenticity of shooting at location enhances the fantasy within the story.  In addition, several scenes include fog and this increases the uncertainty within the audience.  These cinematic elements generate an atmosphere where the audience questions Natalia's unyielding belief in her high idealistic view of love.  It also favors the realistic approach, which Mario presents to Natalia.  The realism is present, yet Visconti plays with the imagination of a higher ideals through displaying the agony of loneliness and the desire of being desired and loved.  Le Notti Bianche is a remarkably clever tale that depicts how two different, yet the same, ideals converge through both the real and the imaginary.",1122508800,19,4669,5.10935441370224
2290771,5,B0009HLCTC,"A very unique adaptation of the Dostoyevsky story, 'White Nights'is one of Visconti's most accessible films. Somewhere between his two main influences - Neorealism (he was one of the founders of neorealism) and the quasi-operatic style of such lush historical dramas such as 'Senso', 'the Leopard', and 'the Damned' - 'White Nights' has its own unique style.

The film has a dream like quality to it, enhanced greatly by the beautiful cinematography of Giuseppe Rotunno. At times the set design feels very stylized and deliberate - which greatly assists the romantic mood of the story.

Marcello Mastroianni give one of his most touching performances - and Jean Marais has an almost mythic presence (as in his films with Cocteau)

I would highly recommend this, even to people who would not normally watch a Visconti film.",1121472000,7,822,5.074074074074074
2290772,5,B0009HLCTC,"White Night or Le Notti Bianche was the first film I ever saw by Visconti.  It was nothing like i expected.  I know alot about the Neorealism films and i know Visconti first made his mark in cinema in that genre with La Terra Trema ,  White Night is not a neorealist picture.  Its quiet simply a love story made so beautiful and truthful thats by the end of the film, you feel elevated, as though something has transcended within you.

Warning:  if you haven't seen the film, you may want to skip this paragraph because it gives away the ending.  The thing i love about this movie the most is the ending.  It's not a hollywood ending, but it tricks you in to thinking maybe they'll end up together and that'll be it.  But they don't.  The girls boyfriend shows up and Marcello is left alone in the snow, crying.

This love film is not concerned with boy getting girl, but what we can learn trying to get love.  He may not have the girl at the end of the movie, but he has their whole experience from that night and its something that will last and stay with him forever.

Don't miss this movie, there's nothing else like it.  also the cinematography is breath taking.",1120780800,23,1167,4.317972350230415
2290773,5,B0009HLCTC,"... La Boheme, Swan Lake, the Little Mermaid, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Little Match Girl, you'll surely adore Le Notti Bianche, director Luchino Visconti's most romantic  and least political version of 'neorealismo'. The script is supposed to be based on Dostoevsky's morbid psychological novella ""White Nights"", but the film seems closer in affect to Hans Christian Anderson than to Dostoevsky. Mario, the character played by Marcello Mastroianni, makes this connection explicit by chiding Natalia, acted by Maria Schell, for living out a fairy tale fantasy of Love.

Schell's performance as the naive, over-protected, love-lorn Natasia is brilliantly complex and convincing, even though Maria is exquisitely close to delusional madness much of the time. Mastroianni won the prestigious 'Nastro d'Argento' as Best Actor for his performance as Mario, a man in his early thirties (Mastroianni was in fact 33) who has come to work in a new city without family or friends. Mario has tired of the 'good times' lifestyle. He's shy and moody, and fond of strolling alone late at night, deep in thought. He's not Dostoevsky's neurotically alienated young man, however; in fact, he's a simple nostalgic paesano in search of innocence embodied in a girl just like Natasia, or so he dreams. Frankly, I fear Marcello was too handsome, too well-spoken, too physically adroit for this role, unless by willing suspension of disbelief we accept him as Prince Charming. He describes himself as poor and ordinary, but I strenuously doubt that any man as handsome as Marcello/Mario would be so hapless at age 33. Doors (and windows) open for the charismatically Handsome in this world.

The city, presumably Venice, is ancient and dilapidated, with canals and bridges everywhere, and those bridges conjure up the possibility of suicide as surely as the image of a gun in a drawer forbodes a murder. There are derelicts and drunks on every street, families camping under every bridge, snake-eyed punks on scooters prowling -- all token elements of 'neorealismo' denunciation of egregious social conditions in post-war Italy -- but they are merely background props to the romance. The black-and-white photography has every bit as much narrative power as the acting or the script; even if you don't understand a word of Italian, I think you could dump the English sub-titles and still respond to the mood of the film. It's all shot at night, much of the time in fog or rain, with every scene composed like a chiaroscuro drawing by an Italian master. Le Notti Bianche is, among all else, a beautiful piece of visual art.",1321228800,3,2604,5.107981220657277
2290774,3,B0009HLCTC,"I rented this film mistakenly, thinking it was Michelangelo Antonioni's ""La Notte"" with Marcello Mastroaianni and Jeanne Moreau (I saw ""Jean Marais"" listed in the credits, and mistook his name for ""Jeanne Moreau"").  Truth be told, I have mixed feelings about Mastroianni, although he was used to great effect, and very well cast, in Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""8 1/2"" (to witness Mastroianni at his best, I'd recommend seeing him in two great films by Vittorio De Sica, ""Ieri Oggi Domani"" and ""Marriage Italian Style"").  Maria Schell I'm familiar with from the screen version of Guy Maupassant's ""Une Vie"", in which she played another type of abandoned woman.  And I like her as an actress, although she can be over-the-top.  Her portrayal of Natalia in ""Le Notti Bianche"" is girlish, hysterical and often melodramatic.  But my favorite performance in this picture is that of Jean Marais, who I know from two Cocteau films, ""Le Belle et La Bete"" and ""Orpheus"".  He has an intense and enigmatic presence that jumps out through the screen, even when he is not speaking.  ""Le Notti Bianche"" was filmed in a decaying, pseudo-Venetian kind of urban environment and the cinematography is generally excellent.  This is yet another film informed by Visconti's preference for operatic themes; he specializes in the elaboration of romance and heartbreak.

2290776,4,B0009HLCTC,"There are many films that focus on the unlikelihood of love and the beauty that comes from two people finding one another through circumstances that should otherwise bring nothing but pain, but it is rare to find a film that has the audacity (in a good way) to bring shreds of realism to the `fairytale'.  I think that is why I can't help but laud this film, despite its flaws.  I mean, I am not oblivious to the films low points, but the script ends on such a brilliant note that I feel overly compelled to forget all that went wrong.

This seemingly simple love story unfolds beautifully in the films conclusion as these two emotional lovers come to terms with the eventuality of their relationship, and it is within that beautifully constructed conclusion that this film really makes its profound impact on the audience.

The story revolves around two star-crossed lovers, Natalia and Mario.  They meet one fated night on a bridge and soon begin an emotional courtship as Natalia hangs on to the promises of a past lover and Mario entertains the hope that Natalia's future lies with him.  The meet night after night, and while Natalia is insistent that her lover is coming back to her, she cannot hide her growing affection for Mario.

What is so lovely about `Le Notti Bianche' is that it layers its familiar tone with a purity that doesn't come in many films.  I think I noted this same quality when reviewing films like `Lost in Translation' and `Once'; films that underline what it really means to develop true love, a love that does not rely on physical intimacy.

But, while the script (or story) is the films golden ticket, there are flaws here that test my adoration.

My biggest issue with this film is Maria Schell.  Her performance takes away drastically from the natural beauty of the material.  That `purity' is lost in her portrayal of Natalia, which is sad since her co-star, Marcello Mastroianni, gives such a beautifully layered performance.  He brilliantly captures Mario, inside and out, and gives us so many positive things to look at.  His performance only suffers when chemistry with Schell is hard to find, and that falls on her shoulders, not his.  There are some dry moments in the film, some areas that seem to fall a little flat, but they are not so overbearing that one can truly consider them flaws.  It could have been wound a tad tighter, but I feel that if Schell were able to carry her scenes better those moments would not have seemed dry at all.

And still, that ending is just flawless (not to mention the boat ride, which is one of the most beautifully memorable scenes in the history of cinema).

I highly recommend this film, despite Schell.  I wish that a better actress had been cast, only because this film has all the makings of something marvelous, but as far as scripting, directing (Visconti is breathtakingly acute here) and Mastroianni are concerned (Marcello takes my Actor award in 1957), `Le Notti Bianche' is something NOT to be missed.",1262563200,2,2991,4.695402298850575
2290777,4,B0009HLCTC,"Luchino Visconti's 1957 film, Le Notti Bianche (White Nights), winner of the Silver Lion Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, and adapted from a Fyodor Dostoevsky story of the same name, is not quite a great film- for it lacks any great nor new ideas, but it's a very good film that uses the elaborate Hollywood style sets of that era, crafted by Enzo Eusepi on a Cinecitt sound stage that is manifestly artificial, to create a very un-Hollywoodian tale of love, especially in its seemingly dour ending for its hero. The use of these elaborate sets immediately brought to mind Woody Allen's 1991 film Shadows And Fog, and its reliance on German Expressionistic silent films, as well as the more recent cartoon The Triplets Of Belleville. This film's dependency on those roots, likewise, adds a creepiness and dark undertone to the seemingly straight Romantic tale the film tells.... as easily as the film could have descended into trite and hyperbolic melodrama, it is all the more admirable for its restraint- shown in the screenplay, the acting, directing, lighting, and many other aspects. It only gives us the bare essentials. It never overloads the viewer with information that could heighten the realism while muting the drama. There are only small moments depicted- even in the more elaborate mugging and dance scenes. There is one charming scene, especially, where we see Mario being swooned over by some young women through a glass window, and one writes Ciao to him in the mist upon the pane, that lets us know that, despite being the loser on this night, he will triumph in the end. Yes, love may be blind, and cruelly so, for Mario is blinded by Natalia- the more he tries to sound practical in his dissuasions to her the more he is smitten by her Romantic fortitude; Natalia by the tenant- the more he is absent the more she desires him; and the tenant by his mysteries- whatever they are, but this film is about life, and- in the end, most of life is not deep. The film ends realistically in its lack of profundity. Love stinks, but life goes on, to merge two clichs into a newer one. But, the fact that a clich exists does not alter it, nor make it less real a truth. It's only how one applies the truth, or clich, to one's future endeavors that matters.
  The film, within itself and without, exists a bit outside of time. There is a sense that time is distorted, for we sense Mario and Natalia's budding intimacy could not have been achieved in a mere four day period. It's as if the film has distorted time, compressed it, to heighten the drama, yet the viewer accepts this because the film never presses too strongly on other points- it never screeches loudly its posits nor plaints of the cosmos. Visconti alternately called this film Neo-Romantic and Neo-Intimist, but it is really more Neo-Fantasist, if anything, for it is too realistic in tone to be neo-Romantic, and too archetypal to be Neo-Intimist. I generally reject such -isms, so will call it simply a damned good tale. If you need more of a marker than that to go and see it, then you are more lost and prone to fantasy than this film's characters, although even less likely to get your reward. And this verity is precisely why films like this are made.",1221350400,,3241,4.644599303135888

2290781,5,B0009HLCTC,"Lucino Visconti's ""White Nights"" (1957) - is an engaging, uplifting, and compelling screen adaptation of Dostoyevsky's short story. I applaud to Visconti's masterful and elegant direction - everything is exquisite in his masterpiece. The settings came from a fairy tale - he moved his heroes to the dream like city that looked very much like Venice - with its canals and bridges. Original story took place in 19th century St. Petersburg - which always has been nicknamed ""The Northern Venice"". The film is set in the modern time. I was curious to see how Visconti would play the title. ""White Nights"" is the period of time in the beginning of June when the nights in St. Petersburg are very short. Alexander Pushkin described this time in one of his poems -""The morning rushes to catch the evening only giving darkness two short hours"". Visconti's film takes place in the beginning of winter and during the last meeting between the heroes, the snow began to fall, giving the title and to the two final scenes new, deep, and very moving meaning. Is the ending happy or the sad one? I still don't know but what is certain that it is unforgettable. I also want to mention three lead actors who made this story so real, tender, sad, and poetic: Maria Shell as a desperate woman awaiting the return of her fairy tale prince - Jean Cocteau's leading man Jean Marais and lonely, shy clerk Marcello Mastroianni who was happy once if only for a few short minutes.

P.S. The ""Dancing Scene"" stands alone as one of the best scenes in the history of Cinema.",1172448000,5,1545,4.65934065934066
2290782,5,B0009HLCTC,"One of the most romantic and peculiar films ever witnessed. This is no neorealism, existentialism or any other avant-garde movement. This is plain and simple true cinema. It has the flavor of the theater in some secuences, an almost claustrophobic scenery (the dark and sad streets of an Italian town -Cinecita-), and above all a dreamlike quality so remarkable that Visconti describes as ""intimism"".

Based on a short story by Dostoyevsky, Visconti gives his characters an idealistic role. Maria Schell is wonderful... undescribable. Mastroiani approaches her thinking she might be a prostitute but discovers immediately that she is truly the opposite, ""I didn't think people like you still existed"". He comes from a realistic level, and during the interaction with her he has to elevate himself to higher (almost saintly) standards, with all its spiritual luggage: innocence, honesty, altruism, brotherly love, hope, exaltation, kindness... what we call today ideals.

I couldn't get the film out of my head the next day. I still like better A Brief Encounter, by David Lean, but this one follows close behind in my gallery of romantic stories on film. I think Mastroiani and the Schell did one of the best works as a pair in any movie in history.

Now, what is the purpose of this such peculiar way of telling the story? What is so appealing and so weird at the same time in this film? I think that the very improbability that a story like this could happen today, reveals how anti-spiritual we've become. In our relations with other humans we do our best to play our role, to not be cheated, to outsmart the other, to deceive, to be selfish while appearing cordial. This love story would be like any other love story. But Visconti's trick (or magic idea) is to face this modern lover with an extra-ordinary woman who can not be dealt with other than at face value. She has no mask, she is real, she is a soul with a face. Mastroiani has the option to walk away because there's no chance with this woman: she is in love with another man. However...

So more than the story per se, it is the treatment that the director does of this lovely and intimate story that appeals to me.

This Criterion edition is extremely beautiful. It has also the audio commentary (as usual) and Dostoyevsky's book narrated in audio very nicely.

8060801,4,B0009HLCTC,"Le Notti Bianche, or White Nights, is a dark yet passionate film about love, loneliness, and sacrifice.

A young man and woman, Mario and Natalia, meet by chance one night as Mario is strolling the streets of their small village. The artificiality of the sets and casual nature of their acquaintance misleads the viewer into believing this will be a typical girl-meets-boy romance; wrong.

As Natalia describes herself and her life, her obsessive tendencies and year worth of pining over another love are quickly revealed. The obsession goes both ways, though, as Mario repeatedly turns down other attractive, eligible women in favor of Natalia, someone he convinces himself he has a future with.

The story takes some very surprising, sometimes horrifying, turns and the ending is far from what Id expected. In addition to the engaging narrative, though, Le Notte Bianche is very well made. Its interesting to see how different aspects of the characters come out through their actions.

For instance, we learn that Mario used to be in the military and now moves around without forming genuine human connection. Scenes later, several military men and their girls enter a cafe and immediately start slow dancing; it takes a while for Mario to ask Natalia to dance, reinforcing his tentative efforts to pursue romance.

The story itself is truly compelling, but little touches like that are what make this film so fascinating to watch. Repeat viewings will surely heighten the visceral, passionate experience that is Le Notte Bianche.",1405987200,2,1532,5.136546184738956

lighthearted comedy about winners and losers.
at the end we are not really sorry for marcello but feel relieved that
his foolish pursuit is over.",1385078400,,407,4.44
8060803,5,B0009HLCTC,"My favorite of Visconti...

This movie is so much like my personal life that it was scary to watch at first.

I like the moral of this story, it is simple and very existentialistic.
The movie has heavy melancholic mood and although it is an Italian film, it feels like it was made by Truffaut.
For those of you who are looking towards an uplifting film I highly recommend not to watch this one...it will only
make you depressed.  Also, if you are suffering a recent break-up, heartache, or a loss of a loved one, and/or it is
snowing or raining out side and you are in a bad mood, DO NOT watch this movie, it will only make you feel miserable.

Those who have ""feelings"" make sure you have a roll of paper towel or tissue box close by...for you will cry your eyes out. I guarantee it.
Those of you who don't have a heart don't even bother watching this one, you will only waste your precious time.",1384992000,,897,4.258823529411765
8060804,5,B0009HLCTC,The DVD is as hoped  and promised. Nice to see it again! I'd like to see some other older films in DVD format as well.,1381708800,,118,3.72
