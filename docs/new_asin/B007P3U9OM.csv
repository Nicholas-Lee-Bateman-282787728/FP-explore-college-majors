5102486,3,B007P3U9OM,"For those of us influenced by the Beatles era glimpses of the hard streets of Liverpool that spawned it, ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" is a bright and magical light, created by the people who cleverly cultivated and promoted the Beatles themselves.  Despite his interminable smile, Gerry Marsden (lead singer of Gerry and the Pacemakers) acts well, as does his brother, and even the largely overlooked band members fare better than expected.

Unfortunately, this print is so fuzzy and the sound so bad (Liverpool accents aren't the easiest to understand under the best of circumstances), one can only wish somebody would clean the thing up, because it's an interesting chronicle of a bygone time.  The story is simple - Gerry and the boys are musicians who've already achieved a level of local popularity, and now want to compete in a significant musical contest.  They manage to find a promising manager who provides them with newer and better instruments; they already have a screaming and fainting female following; and Gerry has a gorgeous, rich girlfriend despite not being so gorgeous himself (he apparently already had a receding hairline shortly after puberty).  The only threat to their meteoric fairy tale rise to success is the accidental disappearance of their instruments the night of the big show, followed by a silly Keystone Kops routine of driving around Liverpool at over-cranked camera speed, retrieving the instruments and returning to the theater just in time to knock everybody's socks off.

Clearly, it's not the storyline that's compelling here; it's the reflection of its time.  Cilla Black performs a song, clearly demonstrating why, in spite of being a hawk-faced, lackluster performer, she was a big star in the UK in those days.  That woman could sing.

The best moments in the film are the musical pieces in unexpected settings and circumstances (very Beatles-ish), sweetly innocent and almost embarrassingly charming.  Gerry demonstrates considerable vocal range and the songs are enjoyable if not memorable.  The movie could best be described as well-meaning and cute and a visual explanation of the desperation of the sixties that drove young people to reach for the stars through music.  Sadly, I'd suggest waiting until this is remastered before buying, as after struggling through it once, you probably won't view it again.",1366502400,4,2354,5.198412698412699
5102487,4,B007P3U9OM,"One has to hand it to Brian Epstein.  Not only did he manage the Beatles through Beatlemania, he also had Gerry and the Pacemakers and Cilla Black as artists under his management.  After he had gotten a feature film for the Beatles, the fabulous ""A Hard Day's Night"" which was followed by ""Help!"", Epstein had a lesser known director, Jeremy Summers make a similar kind of romp for Gerry Marsden and the Pacemakers titled ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" from 1965 which follows the group around Liverpool, especially while on the ferry, singing a total of nine new songs.  Distributed by Audio Tape Incorporated from Longbranch, NJ, the DVD is an adequate copy, specifying it was made from the best source material available, which anticipates imperfections even though the film was released by United Artists.  Although the film played in theaters in 1965 in Plainfield, NJ, I do not remember the Dave Clark Five's film, now released as a Warner Archive title, getting as wide a release although, having nothing to do with the great Richard Lester directed Beatle films, ""Having a Wild Weekend"" was directed by ""Deliverance""'s John Boorman and is a much better film than ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" although it too is in Black and White.  (""Help!"" of course was in color).  Gerry is a very likeable hero and Julie Samuel plays Gerry's main squeeze, with Mona Washbourne as his Aunt.  Cilla Black and the Fourmost also appear.  George Martin is musical director.  The film has a lot of cinematic inventiveness to it although it is not as fresh as what Lester and later Boorman would bring to their films, but it is still entertaining in a painfully, at times, wholesome way.  Gerry and the Pacemakers were much more easy to control apparently than the Beatles.  Wonder if we'll ever see Freddie and the Dreamers' film, ""Seaside Swingers""?",1366156800,,1828,4.864516129032258
5102488,5,B007P3U9OM,Brought back lots of memories. Never seen this before although I was born and raised in Liverpool. A great movie with some good music!,1364428800,,134,4.625

5102490,4,B007P3U9OM,"Cut to arriving plane from America landing at Liverpool Airport to the joy of squealing fans.  Awaiting limo pursued by same starstruck fans. Arrive at recording studio to cut the latest hit single.  It's...Gerry and the Pacemakers.  Gerry Marsden and his mates, unlike their American cousins, wanted to make films that had posterity. ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" falls between the Beatles' masterful ""A Hard Day's Night"" and the Dave Clark Five's misfire ""Having A Wild Weekend"".  The film purports to be about the rise of the Pacemakers from their humble status in working class Liverpool to winning a prestigious talent competition.  For the most part it's a fun film.  Gerry's got a winning personality though his bandmates are kind of shunted to the side.  There is no debating the quality of the songs which are almost universally excellent.  The Pacemakers didn't have the staying power of their compatriots but watch this film to see if that was something of an injustice.",1358985600,15,976,5.0186335403726705

5102493,5,B007P3U9OM,"""Ferry cross the Mersey"" was just one of those fun early 60's promotional movies by Gerry and the Pacemakers filmed entirely in Liverpool that really wasn't that well known and shown that much on TV.The group during that time was probably the second most Liverpool mersey beat group during the early 60's next to the Beatles(Both groups were managed by Brian Epstein).I think the Beatles did 2 movies during""Help"" and ""A Hard Days Night"".There was alot of fun slapstick along with the wonderful era music. Very Liverpudian indeed!!",1346630400,10,531,5.045454545454546

5102516,4,B007P3U9OM,"The movie itself is a five star recollection of the time when Liverpool seemed to be the center of the universe. While Hard Days Night showed an alleged day in their life. Ferry Cross actually showed us Liverpool & all the storied location wrapped around a fun movie that reflects the times. It's too bad they couldn't find a decent print to have made this DVD from. It's like somebody made this from a copy of a copy of a vhs tape. The picture is not clear nor is the audio. With a little eq you can improve the sound but you wonder why they didn't do that before they released this copy. Five stars for the movie itself, two stars for how low the quality of this pressing is.",1429401600,,677,4.2153846153846155

Gerry and the Pacemakers perform eight songs in this musical. Also starring The Fourmost, Cilla Black and Jimmy Saville.

5102536,3,B007P3U9OM,"For a film with low image and audio quality, cheap plastic case and cover and no copyright whatsoever (it's in public domain now due to lack of renewal), this is very expensive. The film itself is good for those who enjoy Gerry & The Pacemakers (or the 60's in a general way). Don't expect this to be A Hard Day's Night, but do expect some similarities.

This movie belongs in every mid-Sixties teenagers' film collection.  The scene of the boys performing the title song on a ferry boat crossing the Mersey is a priceless clip that predated MTV videos in the Eighties.

5102540,3,B007P3U9OM,The plot is lame and the music is not Gerry's best. The value of this B&W is as a document of early British Rock.,1374278400,,113,3.75

5102543,5,B007P3U9OM,I enjoyed listening and watching Gerry and the Pacemakers-Ferry Cross the Mersey movie from 1965. This reminds me of their version of a Hard Days Night by the Beatles. The story line is o.k. However the music is Great! Plus they also take you to the Cavern to watch and listen to Gerry and the Pacemakers when this was happening to give you a feel for the times. The movie might be cheesy to some. If you liked watching a Hard Days Night then you'll like this one.,1371168000,6,464,4.284090909090909

They were obviously inspired by The Beatles A Hard Days Night. I always really liked this band. Although Gerry and the Pacemakers called it quits about a year and a half after this movie was released, they definitely made their mark as one of the better bands of the British Invasion.",1516060800,,445,4.6455696202531644
