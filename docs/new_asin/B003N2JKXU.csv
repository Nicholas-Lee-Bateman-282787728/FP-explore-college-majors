The world knows results that struggle ended in, what the modern geopolitical situation is and how terrorists and gorillas act nowadays in places even far remote from pristine Africa.

A surprising testimony to anti-colonial activities produced, perhaps, at the time for quite different reasons.",1293408000,11,536,5.9480519480519485
