7834805,5,6303039138,"The characters in nglagrd are the kind of people one might meet in rural Sweden. Their values, their lifestyle, their town secrets,  everything is a good reflection of the kind of hegemony one finds in Sweden in general, only condensed and distilled due to the rural setting. The arrival of the outsiders with the crazy ways and the subsequent response of the locals is something I think many expatriates in Sweden can identify with, and it's probably not a coincidence that the director of the movie is an expatriate.
