8271004,2,B0018SUD14,"The box arrived in horrible condition. No hard box just paper wrapped around the original Best Buy pkg. 3 of the four figurines were loose & broken. Only the rooster was in good condition.
The movie was in great condition, that's why the 2 stars. The figurines themselves aren't broken. They just can't go onto the surf boards with both prongs attaching. Only one peg on the three characters are still on them.
If I could attach pictures I would!",1409788800,,446,4.5875
8271005,1,B0018SUD14,"I placed an order for Surf's Up Exclusive FIGURINES & DVD set from Newton Video Dist. The picture showed a box w/ the DVD & FOUR plastic figurines for $25.00. I received the order & it was the DVD w/ a 3inch PLUSH toy. I did not want a stuffed animal for $25!! The cellophane on the box was ripped also. This was supposed to be a gift for my nephew for Christmas..very upsetting! I called the 1-800 # and spoke w/ a young girl who said I could not talk to ""HIM"" until after 5:00. I told her I was upset because I received the wrong product & it was a Christmas gift. She said make sure you check your e-mail because ""he"" chcks it every 5 minutes but 'he' won't come to the phone! Still workin' on it.........",1260748800,2,708,4.064285714285714
