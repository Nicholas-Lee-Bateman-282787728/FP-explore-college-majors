8114269,5,B000EU1M3U,"The videos are extremely well made. I live in the USA and was able to view the region 2 DVD on my computer with no problems. As far as I know, I've never purchased a region specific player as a computer component, but double check yours to be safe (if you're in the USA like me).

There is no captioning available on these, which is a shame, imo. Despite this flaw, the animations, sound effects, and voice over are so fantastic that I can't give the DVD anything less than 5 stars.",1402876800,,482,4.239130434782608
8114270,5,B000EU1M3U,"We had seen these videos on YouTube and my son loved them (especially The Very Hungry Caterpillar.) But they were taken down, probably for copyright reasons. My son kept asking for the videos. So looked for this DVD, and discovered there is a Disney version, but we didn't want that, we wanted this original version. I was concerned because it comes from the UK and is a region 2 PAL DVD that we wouldn't be able to watch it easily. But, I popped into our laptop and it just started playing! If you want the original Hungry Caterpillar, not the Disney version, this is the DVD for you and it will probably play on your laptop without hassle!
 Update: We have since seen the Disney version, and the first thing my 4 year old son said was ""why does it sound funny."" The Disney version just isn't as good as the original.",1361836800,5,818,4.381578947368421
