4934229,3,B00632KV0S,"The product did meet some expectations. I hate the later episodes of this show when they take away the character's diapers. Fortunately, all the episodes in this set do feature episodes where they are in diapers. There were a few missing ones, such as ""Washed up"", ""Flush Hour"", and ""Bruce Bunny"". Other than that, the other diaper episodes are there.",1361577600,,351,4.866666666666666

4934292,4,B00632KV0S,"I got this for my 2 year old son, and he seems to enjoy it for the most part. He's really in love with the Easter episode (I don't think it comes on this set) which is why I purchased another DVD with more options. All the moms out there can relate when I tell you I have watched that Easter episode no less than 50 times, and I needed some sort of alternate to mix in!!! lol. I was a little disappointed to find out that some of the DVDs don't have as many episodes as others, but other than that, it has served it's purpose by distracting my toddler, and Baby Looney Tunes are always cute.",1413158400,2,591,4.016949152542373
